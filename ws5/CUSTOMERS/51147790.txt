Cone's title correctly indicates an \\"in your face attitude\\" as he shares a number of what he claims to be \\"marketing secrets that will make [his reader] a star.\\" Of course, how many of them are head-snapping revelations depends entirely on what each reader already knows (or thinks she or he knows) about marketing. To me, this book's single greatest benefit is that it is thought-provoking. Throughout the book, the tone is personal, conversational really, and sometimes confrontational. Cone challenges those who read it to consider or (better yet) reconsider their responses to questions such as these:<br /><br />1.  What do all \\"winning\\" marketing plans share in common?<br /><br />2. What is a brand? What makes one successful? How to manage it?<br /><br />3. How to create a unique selling proposition?<br /><br />4. How to \\"create, hire, or beg\\" to build a memorable personality for your business?<br /><br />5.  Where do \\"big breakthrough ideas\\" come from?<br /><br />In Chapter 22, Cone discusses the ten \\"secrets\\" he urges his reader to \\"steal.\\" At this point, I presume to offer a caveat: Do not make the mistake of cherry-picking (\\"stealing\\") ideas from Cone or from any others and then cobble them together in what you may assume to be a cohesive and comprehensive marketing plan. Presumably Cone would agree with me that there are three basic questions which must first be answered:<br /><br />1. Who are you?<br /><br />2. What do you do?<br /><br />3. Why does it matter?<br /><br />Unless and until clear and concise answers to these questions are agreed upon by everyone directly involved in the given enterprise, no marketing initiatives will be effective. For many of those who read this book, Cone can help to formulate those answers. He also suggests a wealth of strategies and tactics by which to achieve marketing objectives, once they have been identified. Few (if any) of those who read his book will agree with him about everything he asserts. To repeat, I think its single greatest benefit is that it is thought-provoking. As you read it, take an \\"in your face\\" attitude toward Cone and challenge him to convince you as you proceed from one assertion to the next. I forget who said it but I came across a statement years ago which, in this context, seems especially relevant: If both of us agree, one of us is useless.<br /><br />In the final chapter, Cone explains that this book is meant as a \\"reference guide.\\" What he insists is needed (and I agree) is to use straightforward thinking as well as to understand both what turns people on and gets them to buy products and services and the key elements of building a successful brand. Inorder for any organization to be all that it can be, \\"There is really nothing more important for a marketing professional to do than get the right product in front of the right customer with the least amount of waste in time and money.\\" Quite true. It would also be a good idea to remember Warren Buffett's observation that price is what we charge but value is what others think it's worth.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Theodore Levitt's The Marketing Imagination, Marty Neumeier's The Brand Gap: How to Bridge the Gap Between Business Strategy and Design, Tom Asacker's A Clear Eye for Branding, and Jeffrey J. Fox's How to Become a Marketing Superstar: Unexpected Rules That Ring the Cash Register.ink its single greatest benefit is that it is thought-provoking.

Aunt Ginny really was unaware of this (shall we say) unique talent. She was not trying to be funny, clever, etc. On the contrary, she offered what she considered to be a serious comment and everyone knew what her intended meaning was. For example:<br /><br />\\"Quicker than you can count Jack Robinson.\\"<br />\\"Deader than a door knob.\\"<br />\\"She was born on a silver platter.\\"<br /><br />My personal favorite:<br /><br />\\"He's on a treadmill to Bolivia.\\"<br /><br />I am curious to know what Aunt Ginny would make of Grothe's book. (She died many years ago.) She would no doubt agree with many observations but perhaps not see the humor in any of them. Grothe has selected what he calls \\"oxymoronical\\" material from his vast collection of quotations. With regard to the term, his definition:  \\"Oxymoronica, n.; A compilation of self-contradictory terms, phrases, or quotations; examples of oxymoronica appear illogical or nonsensical at first, but upon reflection, make a good deal of sense and are often profoundly true.\\" As other reviewers have correctly noted, many of the quotations which Grothe has assembled are hilarious, others insightful, still others cynical. All of them qualify as \\"oxymoronica.\\"<br /><br />Among those forgotten or of which I was previously unaware, my personal favorites include:<br /><br />\\"Meetings are indispensable when you don't want to do anything.\\"<br />John Kenneth Galbraith<br /><br />\\"Hatreds are the cinders of affection.\\"<br />Sir Walter Raleigh<br /><br />\\"I must follow the people. Am I not their leader?\\"<br />Benjamin Disraeli<br /><br />\\"What you get free costs too much.\\"<br />Jean Anouilh<br /><br />\\"Good fiction is that which is real.\\"<br />Ralph Ellison<br /><br />\\"Nothing is funnier than unhappiness.\\"<br />Samuel Beckett (in Endgame)<br /><br />Selections are organized within fourteen chapters, each of which has a generic subject such as \\"Sex, Love & Romance,\\" \\"Ancient Oxymoronica,\\" and \\"The Literary Life.\\" I presume to suggest that Grothe's anthology be skimmed occasionally rather than read cover-to-cover. In the Foreword, Richard Lederer offers these comments which serve as an appropriate conclusion to my review: \\"Paradox is a particularly powerful device to ensnare truth because it concisely illuminates the contradictions that are at the very heart of our lives. It engages our hearts and minds because, beyond its figurative employment, paradox has always been at the center of of the human experience.\\" Or, to paraphrase Yogi Berra, if people don't want to appreciate oxymoronica, nobody's going to stop them.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out The Portable Curmudgeon and The Return of the Portable Curmudgeon, both edited by Jon Winokur; also John M.

A brief excerpt from the Afterword offers an appropriate introduction to my review. According to Peter L. Bernstein, \\"At its roots, economics is about how and why our society has changed and developed over time. Even deeper, economics is about risk and return. These are the themes that infuse the contributions to this book. Although the keen insights, original diagnoses, and the rare lucidity of the contributors to this volume inform us about the serious problems we face in today's world, that is by no means all they have to tell us. They have shaped their presentations around the primary elements of economic analysis: supply, demand, expectations, the critical role of real investment, foreign trade and finance, monetary theory and policy, and the interplay between the private and the public sectors. The result is economics at its best -- rich in description, searching in analysis, provocative in argument, profound in generalization, and always focused on the key issues. I am much the wiser for having read it.\\"<br /><br />This is high praise indeed, given the fact that Bernstein is founder and president of a firm which, since 1973, has served as an economic consultant to institutional investors and corporations around the world. He is also the author of a book I  admire very much, Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk, which has sold more than 500,000 copiers since it was published by John Wiley & Sons in 1996.<br /><br />Brilliantly edited by Thomas R. Keene who also wrote the Introduction, what we have here in this volume are indeed \\"fourteen views on the world economy\\" but each provides more, far more than a hit-and-run briefing on its given subject. The authors (or in two instances, the co-authors) of the essays also establish a frame-of-reference within which to present their ideas and do so with meticulous care. Make no mistake about it, however: This book is not an easy read. All of the essays offer important insights and are well-written but some are more challenging than others. For example, David Goldman's \\"Capital Markets and the Economy.\\" Keene wisely recommends that readers review the subjects and then his short introductions to select those articles of greatest interest, perhaps read in combination.<br /><br />With regard to the title, Keene credits Kenneth S. Rogoff who does not use the phrase in his Introduction to this book. About two years ago in an issue of The Economist (September 18, 2003), there is an article called \\"Flying on One Engine\\" in which the phrase is attributed to Lawrence Summers, Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, who once observed that \\"The world economy is flying on one engine.\\" The article concludes, \\"For the past few years, politicians have done little more than hope that the American engine carries on working. But this is no longer good enough. Policy makers need to act to make a crash less likely and avert protectionist threats. A good first step would be to acknowledge the size of the problem.\\" In an essay in this volume, \\"The Global Labor Arbitrage,\\" Stephen S. Roach assesses the productivity and the information-technology-enabled efficiency of a (not the) future world economy, \\"impatient with our inability to confront, consider, and to finally come to terms with what lies ahead.\\"<br /><br />With regard to some of the other essays, John P. Lipsky and James E. Glassman address \\"the topic of the day, unemployment.\\" Tim O'Neill \\"destroys\\" pop-globalization myths and rebuilds a foundation of interdependent trade realities  of nations and people who are \\"grounded in a world's timeless need to trade and, perhaps, trade freely.\\" Richard B. Berner \\"sheds light on American business and its inextricable linkage to the larger economics of the United States and the world.\\" I agree with Keene that David P. Goldman's discussion of \\"Capital Markets and the Economy\\" is the most challenging article among the fourteen. It is also among the most rewarding, especially after a second or thirdreading. In \\"Europe's Political and Economic Future,\\" Thomas Mayer addresses a limited set of combined fiscal and monetary now made available to an aging Europe. \\"No rose-colored glasses for this former International Monetary Fund economist.\\"<br /><br />In the Introduction, Rogoff suggests that \\"This book may be the first of its kind. Let's hope it is not the last.\\" I agree while commending Keene on having achieved his goals: to allow the contributors to expand in areas of their special expertise, to create a book which \\"forms a reliable bridge from the dryness of textbook theory to the real-world excitement of applied capital-at-risk economics,\\" and to provide in this single volume \\"the best in thought-provoking writing on market economics [which will] lead to answers and also to deeper questioning and further study.\\"<br /><br />Bravo!ical and Economic Future,\\" Thomas Mayer addresses a limited set of combined fiscal and monetary now made available to an aging Europe. \\"No rose-colored glasses for this former International Monetary Fund economist.\\"    In the Introduction, Rogoff suggests that \\"This book may be the first of its kind.

The same is true of the publications which feature their work. Back to Buckley: \\"The New Yorker cartoonists may too, deep down, be spitting mad, but they do a good job of transforming that specific anger and disappointment into exquisite generic commentary on the old human condition....If a newspaper editorial cartoon shouts its opinion at you over the scrambled eggs, The New Yorker cartoon hands you a Scotch and nudges you toward whatever truth it has in its sights.\\"<br /><br />Credit Robert Mankoff with selecting and editing the 110 presented in this volume. Unlike Thomas Nast's cartoons which  attack William Marcy (\\"Boss\\") Tweed and his corrupt Tammany Hall organization, few of the 110 require an historical context to have meaning, much less impact. That is what Buckley has in mind when using the word \\"generic.\\" I can think of only one or two which may eventually become \\"dated.\\" Hence the relevance of Buckley's reference to \\"the old human condition.\\"<br /><br />The captions of the cartoons are so clever that it is easy (perhaps too easy) to underestimate the quality of their creators' draftsmanship. (In contrast, few of Oliphant's cartoons even have a caption.) Without being able to see many of the drawings, you already get the point. For example:<br /><br />\\"In the midst of chaos, Larry is the clear voice of reason. Get him the hell out of here.\\" (James Stevenson, page 1)<br /><br />\\"People of North Dakota! Or possibly South Dakota!\\" (J.B. Handelsman, page 23)<br /><br />\\"On the other hand, if we backpedal too much, we'll lose the hate vote.\\" (Frank Modell, Page 36)<br /><br />\\"Grayson is a liberal in social matters, a conservative in economic matters, and a homicidal psychopath in political matters.\\" (James Stevenson, page 91)<br /><br />\\"Great. You touched all the bases without getting bogged down in constitutionality.\\" (Bernard Schoenbaum, page 96)<br /><br />Perhaps only cartoons featured in The New Yorker could be praised by Buckley for \\"distilling\\" fury \\"into a tone of gentle wit and piquancy.\\" Here are 110 of the best. By all means enjoy this book but take good care of it for those in future generations who also appreciate \\"exquisite generic commentary on the old human condition.\\"<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this volume are urged to check out Roger A. Fischer's Them Damned Pictures: Explorations in American Political Cartoon Art as well as Attack of the Political Cartoonists edited by J.P.

On occasion, I read two books at about the same time which can be an \\"odd couple\\" indeed. For example, this book and New York Stories. As editor of the latter, Constance Rosenblum focuses on what she characterizes as the \\"glories, frustrations, and peculiar appeal\\" of New York City and the same can be said of Maharidge's perspectives on Denison. Although there are many stunning differences between the two cultures, both exemplify the best and worst of what is often referred to as the \\"American Experience.\\"<br /><br />With regard to this book, it is the latest of several collaborations by Maharidge and Williamson. In this instance, we accompany them during their search for \\"the soul of America through the secrets of a midwestern town.\\" I do not recall being in Denison specifically but as described so vividly by Maharidge, the town seems very familiar...especially when I look at Michael Williamson's photographs. I am reminded of countless other small towns in the Midwest I visited in my childhood and adolescence, and then later while in college. Of course, they changed a great deal during subsequent decades (as have I) and that is one of the most fascinating subjects (among many) in this book.<br /><br />Children are born, grow up, and then most leave as soon as they can for better jobs, brighter lights, a faster pace, etc. A \\"dying\\" town is one which loses appeal to its youth as its  economy irrevocably declines. There are more burials than baptisms. (This process of deterioration is effectively portrayed in Larry McMurty's novels The Last Picture Show and its sequel, Texasville, as well as in films based on them.) Many of those who remain have nowhere else to go or lack the desire to seek a better life elsewhere. Here are some key facts:<br /><br />About 60% of the state's college graduates leave.<br />Denison's population is almost 8,000.<br />Latinos comprise about 25% of that number.<br />Meat packing plants are the backbone of Denison's economy.<br />Maharidge and Williamson lived in Denison for a year.<br />Most residents seem willing, at times eager to share their thoughts and feelings.<br />Maharidge adds his own opinions from time to time, when appropriate.<br />He also provides relevant historical information to establish a frame-of-reference.<br />Denison adopted \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" as its motto.<br /><br />As for that civic motto, proudly featured on a water tower, it is explained by the fact that Donna Reed is a native of Denison. As Maharidge suggests, the motto is true of many residents but certainly not of all. Similar to so many other small towns throughout the United States, Denison is in the midst of an especially difficult transition. With all due respect to the significance of  shifting demographics, Maharidge and Williamson concentrate almost entirely on specific residents and what appear to be their representative human experiences. The \\"secrets\\" to which the subtitle refers are best revealed within the narrative.<br /><br />Of all the people with whom Maharidge and Williamson associated for more than a year, the one of greatest interest to me is Louis Navar. Consider this brief excerpt with which the book concludes. Navar has just landed a job doing a roof for Dick Knowles, a \\"nemesis\\" of two other residents, Al Roder and Ken Livingston. \\"I thought we were friends,\\" one of them said. Read carefully Navar's response:<br /><br />\\"I told them it was business, that I do business with everyone, that in Mexico it is much rougher than here. You don't trust anybody, you are only a friend after you prove it, when it really matters. It is earned. You do business with people, and you shake hands and smile and call each other `friend,' but you're not really friends. You don't trust them. It is just business. So I am doing business with Mr. Knowles [and then extending his hand to the mayor]...and with you, friend.\\"<br /><br />Navar has so many dreams but almost no illusions. His intelligence, passion, ambition, decency, and -- especially -- his energy and \\"street smarts\\" are precisely what are needed to revitalize Denison. In several respects, he is whatever future the town has.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out others co-authored by Maharidge and Williamson: And Their Children After Them: The Legacy of Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, Homeland, Journey to Nowhere: The Saga of the New Underclass, and The Last Great American Hobo. Also three books by William Least Heat-Moon: Blue Highways: A Journey into America, PrairyErth (A Deep Map): An Epic History of the Tallgrass Prairie Country, and River Horse: The Logbook of a Boat Across America.<br /><br />If your preference is for relevant works of fiction, I recommend the short stories of Eudora Welty and Flannery O'Connor as well as Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio and Edgar Lee Masters' poems, notably those in his Spoon River Anthology.eded to revitalize Denison.

24516:US	51147790	R2I8DT6QWXA9FQ	0836258983	484053188	Oliphant's Anthem	Books	5	3	3	N	N	The art and science of "stirring up the animals"	Pat Oliphant is one of my favorite political cartoonists and this is among the best of several collections of his work. What to say? Oliphant's Anthem is the companion volume to an exhibition at the Library of Congress (in 1998) which commemorated his art. It provides graphic and compelling illustrations of his reactions to a period which extends from the Viet Nam War until the Clinton administration. The collection includes 60 drawings, sculptures, and various art media which have been added to the Library's permanent collection. In the Preface, James H. Billington observes that the Library of Congress is pleased \\"to add Pat Oliphant's name to the pantheon of great political artists represented in our holdings and proud to contribute, through this exhibition and publication, new information about a creator whose ideas, accomplishments, and art will certainly endure.\\" Credit Sara Day with gathering and then editing the material provided in this volume.<br /><br />That said, and with all due respect to those who praise Oliphant's art, it requires no explication. It speaks for itself and does so with a visual power and eloquence which I (at least) am unable to describe. So, what would be appropriate to share in a brief commentary such as this? First, that Oliphant's best work immediately seizes one's attention (as does Picasso's Guernica and Munch's The Scream) and the viewer either \\"gets it\\" or doesn't. Also, he captures in each drawing and in each sculpture the essence of his subject (as he perceives it) and challenges those who view it to absorb and digest the implications of what he offers. Finally, he communicates his sense of rage in response to what he views as (for lack of a better term) \\"man's inhumanity to man.\\" Even as he expresses anger, dismay, frustration, and impatience, he never indicates that he has lost all hope that various inhumanities can be eliminated while insisting that none should be tolerated.<br /><br />Of special interest to me is Harry Katz's interview of Oliphant on pages 13-78, accompanied by relevant illustrations with brief explanations. Oliphant responses to questions which readers such as I would probably ask if given the opportunity. For example, this brief excerpt quoted verbatim:<br /><br />\\"Katz: So you were aware pretty early on that cartooning didn't get the respect that it deserved for the quality of work that it represented.<br /><br />\\"Oliphant: Yes, not enough anyway. David Low did more for the art than anybody in this century, I think. Of course there've been others, but his penmanship and his brushwork, and his sense of draftsmanship were just so well advanced. And of course you need to believe in something when you're doing this business.<br /><br />\\"Katz: What did you believe in at that time? [i.e. late-1970s] What was behind the passion? Did you feel in your gut that there was a tradition you wanted to be part of?<br /><br />\\"Oliphant: Yes. And I don't think there's such a thing as a good conservative cartoonist. I think you have to have a fire in the gut to do it, and that doesn't come from being a conservative. You have to, by necessity, be a liberal. Otherwise you don't get into cartooning. You go and be a lawyer, or a stockbroker. You're not gonna sit there complacently and let things happen around you or to you. It's a way of being able to participate and maybe influence. Any cartoonist who rates himself or herself as a conservative will inevitably turn out cartoons which look like book illustrations -- all very competent, but with no fire or heart.\\"<br /><br />Oliphant never seems to lose what Rafael Sabatini says of Andre Moreau in the novel Scaramouche: \\"He was born with the gift of laughter and a sense that the world is mad.\\" One of my personal favorites portrays President Ronald Reagan as he was about to launch his campaign for a second term. Oliphant created a whimsical illustration of him (\\"There he goes again,\\" page 40) wearing a top hat and tails and carrying a cane, leaping from one ice floe to another. The caption refers to a favorite Reagan putdown in presidential campaign debates as well as to his reputation as the \\"Teflon president.\\"<br /><br />Most of his cartoons leave no doubt whatsoever as to what his opinion is of the given subject . The cartoon for which Oliphant received a Pulitzer Prize in 1966 is an indictment of the Viet Nam War. It portrays Ho Chi Minh, carrying a dead Viet Cong in his arms, proudly announcing \\"They won't get us to the conference table...will they?\\" (page 39) Another cartoon (\\"Remember Tiananmen Square,\\" page 46) expresses Oliphant's contempt for totalitarianism's suppression of individual freedom in China.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this volume are urged to check out other collections of Oliphant's editorial cartoons as well as Attack of the Political Cartoonists which provides representative selections from almost 150 of his contemporaries. They and we are in Oliphant's substantial debt, especially as frustration with government leaders throughout the world is, if anything, greater now than ever before.

Articles are grouped accordingly although several could be included in several of the four. The variety of subjects and points-of-view seem especially appropriate to New York. For example:<br /><br />In \\"The House on 11th Street,\\" Mel Gussow reflects back three decades to when young radicals blew up an elegant brownstone house in Greenwich Village, sharing \\"echoes of the past\\" which continue to linger.<br /><br />In \\"Nothing But Net,\\" Thomas Beller describes \\"a patch of asphalt\\" in a West Village playground which seems like an \\"empty page in the urban landscape\\" because it needs players \\"to give it meaning.\\"<br /><br />In \\"The Allure of the Ledge,\\" Ivor Hanson explains why the window washer is \\"the ultimate risk taker, the ultimate voyeur\\" while \\"working close to the clouds.\\"<br /><br />In \\"The Ballad of Sonny Payne,\\" Steven Kurutz explains why one panhandler on the F Train, \\"the man with the white beard and gentle eyes,\\" is so popular, indeed loved.<br /><br />In \\"My Neighborhood, Its Fall and Rise,\\" Vivian Gornick discusses the West Farms area of the Bronx, \\"dreary\\" in the 1950s and \\"desolate\\" in the 1970s, which is beginning to recover.<br /><br />In my opinion, it would be a mistake to assume that only New Yorkers or those who once lived in New York will fully understand and appreciate the material in articles such as these. On the contrary. To be sure, New Yorkers (i.e. residents of any of the five boroughs) have a distinctive style and personality. At least in Manhattan, the pace of most human activities is often frantic. Yes, some people can seem competitive and perhaps confrontational. Throughout almost 50 years, my own experiences suggest that most New Yorkers can be -- and often are -- friendly and helpful when treated with courtesy and respect.  That said, they are far more diverse and complicated than facile stereotypes presume to suggest. Nor can any single volume such as this one do full justice to the nature and extent of their shared culture. Credit Rosenblum on her skillful selection of articles. Credit, also, their authors who explore the \\"glories, frustrations, and peculiar appeal\\" of a city unlike any other.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Writing New York: A Literary Anthology, edited by Phillip Lopate and available in a paperbound edition. Also the aforementioned 110 Stories: New York Writes After September 11 edited by Ulrich Baer, also available in a paperbound edition.In my opinion, it would be a mistake to assume that only New Yorkers or those who once lived in New York will fully understand and appreciate the material in articles such as these.

Cohen is certainly well-qualified to reveal and then discuss various \\"secrets\\" which he converts into \\"lessons\\" by which to guide and inform business initiatives. He understands far better than do most of his readers that many comparisons and contrasts between the military and the business world are inappropriate. For whatever reasons, however, executives constantly use military nomenclature when explaining how they plan to \\"attack\\" a market segment, introduce a category \\"killer\\" product, \\"blow\\" a competitor \\"out of the water,\\" launch a \\"guerilla\\" marketing campaign, etc. Whereas in other books which \\"look only at the individual commando organizations with which a particular author is familiar,\\" Cohen takes a comprehensive approach: \\"There is a commonality in how organizations are led in all successful commando units. This book synthesizes these techniques. It covers the essential methods that commando leaders in the British Special Air Service (SAS), Israeli Sayeret Mat'kal, and [U.S.] commando units employ. But it also covers techniques that have been used by commando units throughout thousands of years of history to accomplish extremely challenging tasks against vastly superior odds.\\" In this brief excerpt, Cohen has identified what differentiates his book from any other of which I am now aware: It examines commando units from a number of different military services in several different countries as well as other commando units pre-20th century.<br /><br />With regard to the aforementioned \\"secrets,\\" there are no head-snapping revelations among them nor among the core principles which most (if not all) leaders of commando units share in common nor among the \\"fourteen key strategies\\" which Cohen analyzes in Part 2. Of greatest interest and value to me is what Cohen has to say about specific assignments or situations. For example, when Gideon led a group of 300 Hebrews to victory against a vastly superior number of well-trained, battle-experienced Midianites in a fortified encampment. That was around 1100 B.C.<br /><br />Other exemplary (special) operations include those when 300 Spartans led by Leonidas held off about 225,000 Persians at Thermopylae in 480 B.C.; when Col. James Doolittle led 16 B-25Bs during a raid on Japan in 1942; and when Brig. General Dan Shomron led the IDF rescue of 105 hostages at the Entebbe airport in 1976. I also appreciate Cohen's inclusion of examples from the business world where, after only minor adjustment, each of the principles of special ops leadership can also be effective, especially when there seems to be no acceptable alternative to \\"commando\\" initiatives. Hence the importance of those principles to the leaders of the Manhattan Project, Lockheed's \\"Skunk Works,\\" and Xerox PARC.<br /><br />Is this book about great special ops leaders and what they and their associates achieved, often against what seemed to be prohibitive odds?<br /><br />Or is this book about what can be learned from them that is relevant to the contemporary business world?<br /><br />In a word, Yes.encampment.

Unlike so many other authors of books on marketing, he devotes less time to principles (albeit sound ones) and more time to explain how and why effective application of those principles can help any organization (regardless of its size or nature) to create or increase demand for whatever it sells. I am among those who believe that literally everyone involved in a given enterprise should be actively involved in marketing. That is, take advantage of appropriate opportunities to help promote their company among family members, neighbors, friends, casual acquaintances, and even people whom they meet by chance. True, not all of those thus encountered are prospective buyers but most (if not all) of them know others who are. As Emanuel Rosen has explained so brilliantly in Anatomy of Buzz, a company's employees comprise its single most important (and least expensive) resource for word-of-mouth marketing (i.e. BUZZ). They can and should be actively involved in a \\"campaign\\" under inspiring leadership, once having been properly prepared.<br /><br />All of the 14 \\"real-life\\" marketing plans which Johnson presents illustrate how to organize, launch, and then expedite an effective marketing campaign. For those who already have extensive experience in marketing, much of the material provided will no doubt be familiar. However, who knows? There may be some helpful reminders as well as an occasional insight or two of direct relevance. For others, Johnson provides a step-by-step analysis of twelve different plans which offer a range and depth of strategies and tactics to consider.<br /><br />One caveat: Valuable as books such as these can be, it would be a serious mistake to depend almost entirely on it or any other single source of information and counsel. Whatever and wherever it may be, a given competitive marketplace is necessarily messy and often volatile. Change is the only constant. Therefore, I strongly recommend that a variety of sources be consulted.<br /><br />I also presume to suggest that, more often than not, the most valuable source consists of those with whom you now do business. What do they most appreciate about what you offer? What do they consider most valuable in their relationship with you? What are their own needs (especially unmet needs), interests, fears, concerns, and (yes) \\"dreams\\"? What more can you do? What can you do better? Obtain answers to questions such as these and you will already be well along toward knowing how to \\"supercharge\\" your marketing initiatives.I also presume to suggest that, more often than not, the most valuable source consists of those with whom you now do business.

In addition to learning a great deal about what Harrison refers to as \\"entrepreneurial DNA\\" and \\"the DNA of success,\\" I also thoroughly enjoyed reading this book because the material is so well-organized and presented with a clarity and eloquence I seldom encounter in books which respond to questions such as these:<br /><br />1. \\"What prevents one person from evolving and adapting to change [while there are others who get ahead] regardless of the obstacles that stand in [their] way?\\"<br /><br />2. \\"Are some people [in italics] naturally [end italics] endowed from birth with characteristics that invariably lead to success?\\"<br /><br />3. \\"And if so, what about those of us who may not be so genetically gifted?\\"<br /><br />4. \\"Are we doomed to a lifetime of repeated failure if those qualities don't come naturally?\\"<br /><br />5. \\"Is success the product of something in our DNA or something we learn?\\"<br /><br />6. \\"Or is it some combination -- a genetic, instinctive predisposition that we can enhance at crucial moments in our lives by using learned skills and abilities?\\"<br /><br />Harrison offers his own responses to these important questions, and explains the reasons for the conclusions he has reached. Those responses are best revealed within his narrative. I'm not giving away the plot, however, when adding that Harrison explains how highly successful people have leveraged certain inherited traits and learned how to compensate for those that they lack. He thereby suggests how those who read his book can do the same.<br /><br />This is not an easy read but well worth the effort to absorb and digest the material. Obviously, following Harrison's suggestions is much easier said than done. He has carefully studied the works of Charles Darwin and believes in the concept of natural selection. At one point, he asserts that evolution \\"is what it's all about -- in business, careers, and life....Evolution has refined our genetic instructions over centuries to help us survive as a species. The DNA that has been passed on is the DNA that worked.\\" To his credit, Harrison focuses most of his attention on 22 exemplary entrepreneurs and business leaders who agreed to share their personal stories. (A complete list of them is provided on pages 227-228.) The process of self-inquiry which Harrison recommends begins with completing a comprehensive \\"Entrepreneurial Personality Quiz\\" which consists of five sections. After each, Harrison suggests what response patterns may (just may) indicate. This is by no means a definitive exercise. Its purpose, rather, is to give to each respondent at least a sense of her or his entrepreneurial quotient.<br /><br />Please go back and re-read the six questions listed earlier in this brief commentary. If you are as interested now as I was then in learning what Harrison's responses are, I urge you to purchase this book and then read it one chapter at a time, then re-read the chapter before proceeding to the next. The journey he invites you to begin should proceed at your own pace. Enjoy each moment while keeping in mind that there is both \\"good news\\" and \\"bad news\\": that journey never ends.ed.\\" To his credit, Harrison focuses most of his attention on 22 exemplary entrepreneurs and business leaders who agreed to share their personal stories.

In this instance, inspiration and guidance to transform one's life. There are several reasons why I hold this volume in such high regard. Here are three.<br /><br />First, Butler-Bowdon has assembled excerpts and focused on key points from a wide variety of works which include (with authors listed in alphabetical order, as in the book), Marcus Aurelius' Meditations, Robert Bly's Iron John, Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyers' The Power of Myth, Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People, the Dalai Lama and Howard C. Cutler's The Art of Happiness, Wayne Dyer's Real Magic, Ralph Waldo Emerson's Self-Reliance, Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography, Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching, Abraham Maslow's Motivation and Personality, Thomas Moore's Care of the Soul, Joseph Murphy's The Power of Your Subconscious Mind, Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, and Henry David Thoreau's Walden. Obviously, some of this material would also be appropriate for inclusion in 50 Success Classics.<br /><br />Second, I appreciate the fact that Butler-Bowdon also enables his readers to focus on specific themes of greatest interest to them by suggesting combinations of selections as follows:<br /><br />The Power of Thought: Change your thoughts, change your life<br />Following Your Dream: Achievement and goal setting<br />Secrets of Happiness: Doing what you love, doing what works<br />The Bigger Picture: Keeping it in perspective<br />Soul and Mystery: Appreciating your depth<br />Making a Difference: Transforming yourself, transforming the world<br /><br />The diversity of Butler-Bowdon's primary sources is indeed impressive even when grouped according to a common theme.<br /><br />Third and finally, he makes clever use of a number of reader-friendly devices throughout his narrative, such as \\"In a nutshell,\\" \\"Final comments,\\" and a brief bio of the author at the conclusion of each selection. I also appreciate the inclusion of brief quotations wherever they are most relevant.<br /><br />In the Introduction, Butler-Bowdon observes that a self-help book \\"can be your best friend and champion, expressing a faith in your essential greatness and beauty that is sometimes hard to get from another person.

He is a master draftsman of caricature, to be sure, and -- in most instances -- allows his drawings to speak for themselves without benefit of a caption. What we have in this volume is a collection which spans a period of 25 years during which he attempted to provide, as he explains, \\"a graphic distillation of the personality of the strutting popinjay on last night's news. [His audience] wants a visual rendering of immediacy and endurance that can be cut from the printed page and saved on the refrigerator, or if disliked, can be ripped from the page, have rude recommendations scrawled upon it, and mailed back to the artist. Such people, pro and con, possess awareness and opinion, and as such are to be blessed.\\" Reactions to Oliphant's work confirm the success of his efforts to achieve one of two reactions which Lucy Shelton Caswell has so aptly described as an \\"ah\\" of agreement or an \\"argh\\" of disgust.<br /><br />Credit Alan Fern with providing an especially informative Introduction to this collection. Also credit Wendy Wick Reaves with providing the narrative which accompanies the caricatures of six Presidents, beginning with Lyndon Johnson and concluding with George H.W. Bush. That said, the selections themselves really require little explanation. The subjects are immediately recognizable and Oliphant's point-of-view toward each is never in doubt. Of special interest to me is the series of color plates, of which I was previously unaware. They are assembled in a special section. (Their item numbers are 13, 28, 29, 42, 49, 57, 73, 83, and 84.) We are also provided with a series of rough but quite clever sketches, reproduced from Oliphant's notebook.<br /><br />I agree with Reaves that he \\"manages to scratch some personal itch arising from our own frustration with government leaders. But some of the enormous satisfaction we derive from his cartoons can be explained by his ability to go beyond the specific to elucidate the general trends in our national life.\\" Frankly, writing a brief commentary on Oliphant's art poses many of the same challenges as would describing a performance by the Cirque du Soleil. They really need to be seen to be appreciated.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this volume are urged to check out Oliphant's other published works as well as Attack of the Political Cartoonists which provides representative selections from almost 150 of Oliphant's contemporaries. They and we are in his substantial debt, especially as frustration with government leaders is, if anything, greater now than ever before.by his ability to go beyond the specific to elucidate the general trends in our national life.\\" Frankly, writing a brief commentary on Oliphant's art poses many of the same challenges as would describing a performance by the Cirque du Soleil.

First, this is a handbook. Wetmore wrote it to be taken in hand and, once its contents have been absorbed and digested, put to practical use. Second, he brings some fresh perspectives to core concepts (about time, information, and communication) which have been been around for thousands of years. Third and finally, this book and any of the other excellent books which cover much of the same material are essentially worthless if those who read them do not make [begin italics] and then sustain [end italics] a long-term commitment to continuous improvement while using the tips, tools, and techniques recommended.<br /><br />Wetmore immediately and correctly stresses the importance of having a balanced life built on a sturdy foundation. What does that mean? That for most people, attention, time, and effort are like a currency which should be spent, over time, almost equally within seven areas: physical health, family, financial, intellectual, social, professional, and spiritual. Appropriate balance depends upon appropriate proportionality. Hence the importance of establishing priorities prior to the allocation of resources. To some people, having a \\"rich\\" spiritual life is far more important than material wealth. To others, many of them academics and artists, the intellectual area is most important. Of course there are always trade-offs and compromises. Wetmore is right: \\"A deficit in one area [e.g. physical health] can and does affect every aspect of your life.\\" He seems to agree with Jack Canfield and others that the first \\"rule for success\\" in life is to know what you want. Only then can you select the appropriate tips, tools, and techniques. Only then will the inevitable sacrifices required to obtain what you really want seem well worth it. Of course, attitude also plays a decisive role. I am again reminded of Henry Ford's observation: \\"Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.\\"<br /><br />Wetmore organizes his material within four Parts: Time, Information, Communication, and The Big Picture. Throughout his book, Wetmore maintains a personal, conversational relationship with his reader as he does everything he can to share what he has learned about productivity; more accurately, about more effective and more efficient production. (Note: Dropping a 2,000-pound block of granite on a fire ant would be effective but not be efficient.) I commend him on his clever use of chapter titles which are both appropriate and thought-provoking. For example: Putting Off Procrastination (Chapter 5), Delegate the Shirt Off Your Back (7), Whatshisname (13), Blah Rather Than Blah, Blah, Blah (18), and A Big Small Talker (22). Think of the tips, tools, and techniques introduced earlier as pieces of a puzzle (in the shape of a pyramid) which Wetmore helps his reader to assemble in the final chapter. He then provides a Resources section which contains additional aids related to productivity. They include a Time Log which captures \\"snapshots\\" of specific moments during a normal day. (Please see the example on pages 284-285.) Wetmore offers several practical suggestions as to how to derive the greatest benefit from use of a Time Log. He also discusses a Crisis Management Log and a Life Improvement Chart. (Please see pages 294-297.) He concludes with an exercise to be completed by his reader. This exercise is best revealed within Wetmore's narrative.<br /><br />Obviously, I highly admire what Wetmore accomplishes in this book but feel obliged to conclude this brief commentary on it by asserting once again: this book and any of the other excellent books which cover much of the same material are essentially worthless if those who read them do not make [begin italics] and then sustain [end italics] a long-term commitment to continuous improvement of the tips, tools, and techniques they recommend.: Time, Information, Communication, and The Big Picture.

I commend him on his clever use of chapter titles which are both appropriate and thought-provoking. For example: Putting Off Procrastination (Chapter 5), Delegate the Shirt Off Your Back (7), Whatshisname (13), Blah Rather Than Blah, Blah, Blah (18), and A Big Small Talker (22). Think of the tips, tools, and techniques introduced earlier as pieces of a puzzle (in the shape of a pyramid) which Wetmore helps his reader to assemble in the final chapter. He then provides a Resources section which contains additional aids related to productivity. They include a Time Log which captures \\"snapshots\\" of specific moments during a normal day. (Please see the example on pages 284-285.) Wetmore offers several practical suggestions as to how to derive the greatest benefit from use of a Time Log. He also discusses a Crisis Management Log and a Life Improvement Chart. (Please see pages 294-297.) He concludes with an exercise to be completed by his reader. This exercise is best revealed within Wetmore's narrative.    Obviously, I highly admire what Wetmore accomplishes in this book but feel obliged to conclude this brief commentary on it by asserting once again: this book and any of the other excellent books which cover much of the same material are essentially worthless if those who read them do not make [begin italics] and then sustain [end italics] a long-term commitment to continuous improvement of the tips, tools, and techniques they recommend.	2005-09-21

Inorder to review the history of political cartoons before  examining this book, I surfed the Web and came upon a site which shares a wealth of information: [...] I now presume to suggest that this brief history be read first. (Some may find sufficient background information in Lucy Shelton Caswell's even shorter Introduction to this volume.) Credit J.P. Trostle with the selection and editing of the material which focuses on representative work by almost 150 political cartoonists, introduced in alphabetical order. Together, they do indeed offer a wealth of illustrated \\"insights & assaults from today's editorial pages.\\"<br /><br />Of course, our exposure to political cartoons is limited by the number of daily newspapers and weekly news magazines we read. For that reason, I especially appreciate seeing the works of cartoonists of whom I was previously unaware. That is one of the greatest benefits this volume offers. I also appreciate the wide range of perspectives on the most prominent public figures. As Caswell correctly notes, almost all of the selections will elicit one of two responses: an \\"ah\\" of agreement or \\"argh\\" of disgust. For various reasons, political cartoons have an immediate, often compelling impact which Op Ed articles, for example, seldom have. They often seem to me to be the visual equivalent of a sound bite. The most compelling measure up to standards which Pat Oliphant set for himself years ago:<br /><br />To create \\"a graphic distillation of the personality of the strutting popinjay on last night's news. [His audience] wants a visual rendering of immediacy and endurance that can be cut from the printed page and saved on the refrigerator, or if disliked, can be ripped from the page, have rude recommendations scrawled upon it, and mailed back to the artist. Such people, pro and con, possess awareness and opinion, and as such are to be blessed.\\" High standards indeed. Judge for yourself which of the cartoonists' works included in this volume measure up to them.<br /><br />One final point. Whatever the political loyalties and inclinations may be, it seems imperative to me that those in the news media should do all they can to accommodate a wide and deep diversity of opinion. Many eminently qualified persons have refused to become involved in the political process because it is too often polarized and mean-spirited. (Colin Powell is only one of several such persons who come to mind.) On an admittedly personal note, I conclude with the hope that we follow Voltaire's suggestion: cherish those who seek the truth but beware of those who find it. That is as relevant to elected officials as it is to cartoonists who portray them with caricatures such as those presented in this lively, entertaing volume.One final point.

Credit Safire with a brilliant job of selecting and then introducing each. He should also be commended on his \\"An Introductory Address\\" which offers an exceptionally informative as well as entertaining explanation of eleven \\"secrets steps\\" when composing  and then presenting a great speech. (i.e. \\"the meat and potatoes of oratory,\\" \\"the tricks of the speech trade\\").  They include the usual suspects such as structure (\\"shapeliness\\"), pulse, occasion, \\"forum\\" (or venue), focus, etc. Safire adds a few others which, in retrospect, seem obvious but really aren't. For example, the importance of the first step: \\"Shake hands with your audience...Make the first step a quickstep; get your smile, then get to work.\\" Another: \\"Cross `em up now and then.\\" Safire suggests that great speeches are meant to be read, not spoken. \\"What every audience needs is a sense of completion.\\" Therefore, what the speaker needs \\"is a way out on a high note. That's the necessary ingredient to shapeliness. That calls for peroration [which is] a devastating defense against the dread disease of dribbling off.\\"<br /><br />It is worth noting that some great speeches had no significant impact when first delivered (e.g. Lincoln's 266-word \\"Gettysburg Address\\") and some are  delivered only during a dramatic performance (e.g. Antony's funeral oration); however, all great speeches continue to be read and admired long after being written.<br /><br />I question the greatness of some of Safire's selections for this volume, such as the draft he wrote for President Nixon in case the Apollo XI mission ended in tragedy. Fortunately, the speech (actually a brief statement to be read to a television camera) was never delivered and remained unread at the National Archives until 2001 when it re-appeared as part of a major exhibition. Safire himself does not claim that it is a great speech but selected it because \\"it shows how the context of a dreaded dramatic occasion can make memorable words written to be spoken aloud.\\" In this instance, the \\"occasion\\" rather than the content would have made Nixon's remarks memorable. Read it (pages 1144-1145) and decide for yourself.<br /><br />Of special interest to me are the following:<br /><br />\\"General Patton Motivates the 3rd Army on the Eve of the Invasion of Europe\\" (pages 551-555)\\": Actually, this is a \\"collated address\\" which provides the essence of dozens of extemporaneous statements by Patton. Those who have seen the opening scene of film are already familiar with Patton's direct approach: \\"Now I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. You won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.\\" According to Safire, that statement is actually not in any of the contemporaneous accounts he knows about but \\"surely sounds like Patton.\\"<br /><br />\\"Evangelist Sojourner Truth Speaks for Women's Rights\\" (pages 684-685): As with Patton's public remarks, there are several different versions and variations of the illiterate former slave's as she traveled throughout the United States preaching \\"a message that combined religious and abolitionist ideas.\\" To his credit, Safire allows that message to be presented in standard English as presumably she spoke it, without \\"editorial prettification\\" (his words) nor \\"as if I was saying tickety-ump-ump-nicky-nacky\\" (her words).<br /><br />\\"Broadcaster Edward R. Murrow Despairs of the Future of TV Journalism\\" (pages 771-778): This is what was then (1958) a highly controversial challenge to those who controlled the major networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) to ensure that television programming achieves more, becomes more than \\"merely wires and lights in a box.\\" Murrow knew that his remarks would \\"enrage\\" his and other news journalists' employers. In fact, that was his intention when speaking to the Radio and Television News Directors Association. Safire correctly notes that Murrow's opening line (\\"This just might do nobody any good\\") was doubly prophetic: his \\"heretical and even dangerous thoughts\\" weakened his authority and influence at CBS while revealing during his speech what someone else in the audience described as \\"the accents of [Murrow's] despair\\" concerning the commercialization of broadcast news.<br /><br />Safire invites his readers to lend their \\"ears\\" to Patton, Truth, and Murrow as well as to dozens of others whose speeches can stir our blood (Daniel Webster re Bunker Hill ), sound the clarion of war (Elizabeth I in defiance of the Spanish Armada), honor the memory of illustrious dead (Frederick Douglass on Abraham Lincoln), recall the clash of hot debate (Cicero lashing into Catiline), and nourish our soul (e.g. Jesus' Sermon on the Mount).  Safire also includes what he calls \\"the mother's milk of this anthologist,\\" the political speech. A remarkable variety can be found in Chapter XII (pages 853-1,072) and range from Demosthenes' attack of his accuser to Tony Blair's exhortation to fight terrorism. Safire also includes three \\"undelivered speeches\\" in the final chapter, including his draft for Nixon. The other two are President John F. Kennedy's prepared remarks for a luncheon in Dallas on November 22, 1963, and the draft of a speech of contrition which President Clinton rejected, preferring to \\"move on\\" instead.<br /><br />To repeat, if there is a better anthology of great speeches, I am not aware of it.en speaking to the Radio and Television News Directors Association.

49899:US	51147790	R1OLNMHWVUBX1N	0405137893	182209148	The Age of the Moguls (Railroads Series)	Books	5	18	18	N	Y	"Lords of capital" in "a savage and gaudy age"	First, some brief background information about Stewart Hall Holbrook (1893-1964). Throughout his adult years, he was at first a lumberjack and then a writer, journalist, and (his descriptive) \\"lowbrow historian.\\" The Age of the Moguls (1953) is probably his best-known work but it should be noted that, for more than thirty years, he wrote for The Oregonian, the oldest continuously published daily newspaper in the western United States (founded in 1850) and also authored or co-authored dozens of other books whose titles correctly indicate the scope and variety of his interests. For example, Little Annie Oakley & Other Rugged People (1948), Wild Bill Hickok Tames the West (1952) with Ernest Richardson, Davey Crockett (1955), Wyatt Earp: U.S. Marshall (1956), The Golden Age of Quackery (1959), The Golden Age of Railroads (1960), and Wildmen, Wobblies & Whistle Punks: Stewart Holbrook's Lowbrow Northwest (1992), an anthology. Holbrook's style of writing is as lively as his selection of subjects but it would be a mistake to question the authenticity of his historical material. One source (whose name I do not recall) has correctly described him as a \\"feisty David McCullough.\\"<br /><br />In The Age of Moguls, Holbrook examines a number of \\"lords of capital\\" who, in his words, \\"made `deals,' purchased immunity, and did other things which in 1860, or 1880, or even 1900, were considered no more than `smart' by their fellow Americans, but which today would give pause to the most conscientiously dishonest promoter....They were a motley crew, yet taken together they fashioned a savage and gaudy age as distinctively purple as that of imperial Rome, and infinitely more entertaining.\\" The group Holbrook considers is divided into three categories: promoters, bankers, and industrialists, with merchants in the latter group. They include Jim Fisk, Jay Gould, Charlie Gates, Thomas William Lawson, Henry H. Rogers, Henry Morrison Flagler, and Samuel Insull; Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Cyrus McCormick, Philip D. Armour, Henry Clay Frick, Henry Ford, and the Du Ponts; also the Guggenheims, Andrew W. Mellon, James J. Hill, Edward Henry Harriman, Henry Villard, the first two Vanderbilts, and the Astors. Some of these names remain familiar in our own time; others do not. All were \\"tough-minded fellows, who fought their way encased in rhinoceros hides and filled the air with their mad bellowings and the cries of the wounded.\\" A colorful lot indeed.<br /><br />There are several reasons why I hold this book in such high regard. First, until reading it, I knew very little about the social and economic significance of what Holbrook characterizes as a \\"savage and gaudy age.\\" As he explains so well, it was certainly both but the moguls he examines, together, established a bedrock of capitalism which remains intact to this day even as new laws and regulatory enforcement of them seem to ensure that, although Holbrook is not overly  concerned with comparative business ethics then and now, were they alive today, \\"almost every man in this book would face a good hundred years in prison.\\" I admire this book, also, because Holbrook succeeds so well in bringing the moguls to life in ways and to any extent I did not anticipate. Some are much more colorful than others, of course, but Holbrook anchors each in a human context, warts and all. Finally, I admire this book because it enables me and other readers to draw comparisons and (especially) contrasts between the current business world and the one which evolved throughout much of the 19th century. Those who receive most of Holbrook's attention have been variously described (then and now) as \\"giants and titans, and more often as rogues, robbers, and rascals\\" but Holbrook has convinced me that these and other adjectives (both positive and negative) accurately characterize most of them. For better or worse, all were \\"larger than life.\\"<br /><br />Question: Why is this book not available in a paperbound edition??	2005-09-17

Favorably impressed, I then read Improving Your Storytelling which was first published in 1999. Of course, people have been telling stories for thousands of years. My own list of history's greatest storytellers includes Homer, Plato, Aesop, Jesus, the Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), Joel Chandler Harris, L. Frank Baum, and E.B. White.  All of the great storytellers are guided and informed by the same basic principles: They use compelling language and powerful images, establish an appropriate context (physical, intellectual, emotional, and social) within which to place a story, and then develop a relationship with both their audience and their story. As Lipman suggests, the storyteller, audience, and story \\"form the three corners of a triangle -- the storytelling triangle.\\"<br /><br />He offers material \\"beyond the basics for all who tell stories in work and play.\\" Obviously, \\"play\\" includes situations in which stories are told to \\"children of all ages\\" primarily to delight and entertain them. But what about \\"work\\"? While reading Lipman's book, I soon realized that his insights and advice are at least as relevant to \\"work\\" as they are to \\"play.\\" Effective storytelling skills are indeed valuable in all forms of communication between and among people.<br /><br />Only in recent years, however, has there been significant interest in what is generally referred to as \\"the business narrative.\\" I shudder when recalling countless formal presentations I made in the past when droning on and on much as then Governor Bill Clinton once did at a Democratic national convention. Thousands roared their approval when he said \\"In conclusion....\\" and then groaned as he continued on for another 35 minutes. He indicated little (if any) respect for his audience. Had Lipman been given the opportunity to help Mr. Clinton to prepare his remarks, presumably the length of his speech would have been reduced by half, if not by more. Lipman would also have formulated an interesting \\"story\\" to be told with authentic passion or at least enthusiasm while investing the narrative with vivid images and compelling details and, in countless other ways, enable Mr. Clinton to establish, immediately, a close bond with his audience and then nourish that relationship with empathy, respect, and (yes) humility.<br /><br />The material in this book is carefully organized and developed within five Sections after Lipman briefly reviews \\"storytelling basics and beyond.\\" He explains how to transfer imagery. How to establish relationships with the story told, with the given audience, and with yourself. Then in Section Five, he explains how to integrate each component of the storytelling event, noting that \\"the components are  only important insofar as they contribute to the overall effect\\" of the event. That is, as \\"an invisible whole.\\" The focus in Chapter 18 is on the four \\"layers\\" of attention. In the next chapter, Lipman explains how a storyteller can direct her or his attention \\"in a way that helps to connect each moment in the story to [her or his] overall goals for the storytelling event.\\" He concludes by examining what he calls \\"the mystery of transformation -- the sometimes elusive result of perfect balance among all the components of the storytelling event.\\"<br /><br />It is important to keep in mind that, although Lipman briefly reviews the basics of storytelling, he goes \\"beyond\\" them (or at least explores each in much greater depth) than would, for example, an author of Storytelling for Dummies. A story will be told best by continuing to shape it while carefully observing those to whom it is told. Only then will the \\"storytelling triangle\\" have a \\"dynamic balance.\\" To me, the single most important point which Lipman makes is that the storytelling event is the result but never the conclusion of a process. Revision of material and refinement of presentation are inevitable. The storyteller's journey never ends and sometimes no transformation occurs. What then? According to Lipman, \\"change the path, dance backwards, or leap into the unknown.\\"<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this volume are urged to check out Simmons' aforementioned book, The Story Factor, as well as Robert B. Miller and Gary A. Williams' The 5 Paths to Persuasion, Stephen Denning's The Leader's Guide to Storytelling, and Storytelling in Organizations co-authored by John Seely Brown, Denning, Katarina Groh, and Laurence Prusak.entation are inevitable.

Also, which of those involved were \\"fools\\"? And what were their follies? He answers all three, doing so with surgical precision in combination with the narrative skills of a master storyteller. Clearly, he had a wealth of material to work with, much of it not previously shared with the general public.<br /><br />This book will be especially valuable to those who have a keen interest in what is probably the greatest corporate scandal in recent years.  I also commend to their attention McLean and Elkind's The Smartest Guys in the Room as well as Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller's 24 Days: How Two Wall Street Journal Reporters Uncovered the Lies that Destroyed Faith in Corporate America. Whereas Smith and Emshwiller explored the same company as investigative reporters, McLean and Elkind seem (to me) to have approached their subject as corporate anthropologists. Both books reach many of the same (albeit somewhat tentative) conclusions as to what happened...and why.<br /><br />Two significant differences are that Smith and Emshwiller limit their attention primarily to a period in 2002 extending from October 16th (when Enron announced huge losses caused by two partnerships) to December 3rd (when Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy); McLean and Elkind cover a two-year period of the company's \\"amazing rise and scandalous fall.\\" Also, McLean and Elkind devote far more attention to each of the \\"smartest guys\\"; Smith and Emshwiller seem far less interested in them, except in terms of the impact of their mismanagement and corruption. Eichenwald adds substantially to what they and others have already revealed. I also appreciate the fact that he does not hesitate to share his own perspectives on who did and did not do what, what their motives were, and the lessons to be learned from their values, attitudes, and behavior. My guess (only a guess) is that it will be decades before all of the sordid and, for so many victims, tragic details have been revealed. Meanwhile, we owe a substantial debt of gratitude to Eichenwald as well as to Smith and Emshwiller and to McLean and Elkind.y a guess) is that it will be decades before all of the sordid and, for so many victims, tragic details have been revealed.

(Several are identified within this book's Notes section.) That said, I remain convinced that senior-level executives should complete some due diligence on other volumes available by reading the comments on those which are rated highest in the Customer Reviews provided by Amazon. I also think it desirable to consult more than one source (preferably several) which seem most relevant to the specific circumstances within the given organization.<br /><br />In this volume, Greenwald and Kahn succeed remarkably well with clarifying their readers' \\"understanding of strategy and to reframe their approach to it. We want executives to know how their markets work, where there competitive opportunities lie, and how to develop and protect them. To this end, we include both broad discussions of general principles and detailed case studies of actual competitive interactions. Taken together, we think they present a useful guide for people who make strategic decisions.\\"<br /><br />In large organizations, there are entire departments responsible for strategic planning. (Obviously, their efforts are supervised by senior-level executives and usually a board member or two.) In much smaller organizations, strategic planning may be conducted by the owner/CEO alone or by one or two executives. Whatever the situation, strategies are still \\"hammers\\" which drive \\"nails\\" (i.e. tactics) and invariably require both long-term commitments and substantial allocation of resources. Strategies are the cornerstones of plans for achieving and then sustaining success, plans which specifically focus on the actions and responses of competitors. Therefore, in essence, as Greenwald and Kahn correctly observe, \\"strategic thinking is about creating, protecting, and exploiting competitive advantages.\\" That is as true of the family-owned neighborhood store as it is of a Fortune 500 company. The only major differences involve those of scale (e.g. operations and resources). However, I doubt that many owners of neighborhood stores will read this book.<br /><br />I was especially interested in what Greenwald and Kahn have to say about business strategy at work within companies such as Wal-Mart, Coors, the Fox Network, and Kiwi Airlines as well as within others in direct competition: Compaq vs. Apple, Coke vs. Pepsi, and Kodak vs. Polaroid. I was also interested in what they have to say about mergers and acquisitions, venture investing, and brand extensions. In all organizations (regardless of size or nature), it remains imperative for their decision-makers to decide who their organization is...and who it isn't...before launching business development initiatives to become more successful, whatever the given competitive marketplace(s) may be. Greenwald and Kahn's final observation provides an appropriate conclusion to this commentary. In the absence of competitive advantages and barriers to entry, those initiatives have only one strategic imperative: \\"The efficient use of all the resources they require.\\"he only major differences involve those of scale (e.g. operations and resources).

For both the Yankees and the Red Sox, and their fans, that season provided both the best of times and the worst of times. It is to Massarotti's and Harper's credit that the results of their collaboration, this book, succeeds so well in recreating competition both on and off the playing field. Like a classic Dickens novel, their book offers a riveting plot, direct conflict and dramatic tension, colorful characters, memorable moments, and -- best of all --  behind-the-scenes access to fans such as I who saw none of the Red Sox-Yankees (or if you prefer, Yankees-Red Sox) games in person.<br /><br />Granted, the national sports media devoted constant and thorough attention to both teams. Only in Massarotti and Harper's account, however, did I find sufficient answers to questions such as these:<br /><br />1. Why was Grady Little fired as Red Sox manager? Surely there had to be more to it than his deference to Pedro Martinzez.<br /><br />2. How did the Yankees acquire Alex Rodriguez?<br /><br />3. In terms of their deportment, what are the most significant differences between the Red Sox and Yankee players?<br /><br />4. To what extent (if any) did Joe Torre's often strained relationship with George Steinbrenner affect the Yankees' behavior and performance?<br /><br />5. In terms of their relations with the media, how do Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez differ? Why?<br /><br />6. At which point during the season did the Red Sox become convinced that they could win the AL playoffs and then the World Series?<br /><br />7. Who is the real Curt Schilling?<br /><br />8. What is the single most interesting aspect of the Red Sox-Yankees competition during the 2004 season of which most sports fans are still unaware?<br /><br />9. How to explain the fact that the Red Sox won the last eight games they played, especially after going 0-3 against the Yankees in the ALC?<br /><br />10. According to Massarotti and Harper, who were the most valuable and yet least appreciated players on both teams? Why?<br /><br />Soon, the MLB playoffs will begin. It remains to be seen whether or not the Yankees and/or Red Sox will participate. In that event, will they again meet in the ALC? Whatever does and does not happen, one fact seems obvious to me: The 2004 regular season and subsequent playoffs were among the most exciting thus far.

As he explains, \\"This is a book about insights in business -- how we get them, how we recognize them, how we keep them coming....Ideas, valuable though they may be, are a dime-a-dozen in business....Insight is much rarer -- and therefore more precious...a good insight can fuel a thousand ideas....More than anything else, an insight states a truth that alters how we see the world.\\" The allure of a powerful insight: Once you experience one, \\"you can't see the world in any other way.\\" The most valuable insights are those which reveal and then guide and inform an appropriate course of action. Such insights initiate an chain reaction of ideas, some of which -- in turn -- generate other insights.<br /><br />This process can occur in any human enterprise and invariably requires effective communication, cooperation, and collaboration involving several different people. However, everything begins with a need to be filled, a question to be answered, or a problem to be solved. Then extensive research must be conducted, with the results rigorously analyzed. Hopefully, what Dusenberry calls a \\"salient fact\\" will be revealed which should lead to a compelling insight. Then there must be a strategy which will \\"drive\\" the insight during implementation. In advertising, Dusenberry claims, \\"if you have a great insight and strategy, great ads practically write themselves.\\" He would probably be the first to concede, however, that mass production of automobiles (e.g. Ford), creation of feature-length animation films (e.g. Disney), and splitting the atom (e.g. Manhattan Project) may involve the same process but are immensely more complicated than devising and then executing successful advertising campaigns for FedEx, Frito-Lay, GE, Gillette, HBO, Pepsi, Pizza Hut, and VISA.<br /><br />What I especially appreciate about this book is Dusenberry's personal, indeed conversational style as he allows his reader to accompany him \\"down memory lane\\" to re-visit many of the most significant \\"insights and accidents\\" during his career. For each, he carefully establishes a context: the situation, the objective, the challenge(s), the competition, the nature and extent of collaboration at BBDO, the relationship with the given client, the compelling insight, and its primary strategy; then its production, execution, and the eventual (if not always immediate) impact of the given campaign. I also appreciate Dusenberry's wit and, when appropriate, his self-deprecation. He may be in his industry's Hall of Fame but he is mercifully free of a Rushmorean self-image.<br /><br />Frankly, I have become allergic to book titles which are cute, catchy, clever, eye-catching, sticky, gooey, etc. The relevance of this book's title is best revealed within Dusenberry's narrative. However, I do reassure those who read this brief commentary that the title is eminently appropriate. More importantly, the situation to which it refers illustrates that when accidents occur during the production of television commercials featuring celebrities such as Michael Jackson, most of them respond to problems in a professional manner.<br /><br />This is a thoroughly entertaining and well as an unusually informative personal memoir about advertising and BBDO, of course, but also about certain basic business principles which are relevant to all other industries and to all other organizations. In Chapter 13, \\"Building a Foolproof Insight Creation Machine,\\" Dusenberry offers eighteen \\"guidelines\\" (not rules) to guide and inform anyone who is then inspired by his concluding remarks: \\"A strong insight can fuel a thousand reasons to act and make something happen. That, more than anything, should be your reason to fight and persevere for your own insight moment. When you are armed with a powerful insight, the ideas never stop flowing.\\" Dusenberry's memoir provides an abundance of such insights. Hopefully, at least one or two of them will help his readers and their associates to cause their own \\"insight moments\\" to occur.rful insight, the ideas never stop flowing.\\" Dusenberry's memoir provides an abundance of such insights.

Specifically, Net Worth, Net Gain, and Out of the Box. In this most recently published volume, Hagel and Brown assert that effective business strategy \\"depends on productive friction and dynamic specialization.\\" As I began to read this book, I was curious to observe how Hagel and Brown formulate and then present what they call a \\"compelling case [for reshaping] the business landscape -- where and how value and profit get created -- to create a scalable catalyst for broader institutional and policy changes.\\"<br /><br />For them, \\"edge\\" has several dimensions. \\"First, we mean the edge of the enterprise, where one company interfaces or interacts with another economic entity and where it currently generates marginal revenues rather than the core of its profits. Second, the edge refers to the boundaries of mature markets as well as industries, where they may overlap, collapse, or converge...[Third], geographic edges, especially those of such emerging economies as China and India, where consumers of all kinds crave Western goods and services that will ease their burdens and improve their lives. Finally, we refer to the edges between generations, where younger consumers and employees, shaped by pervasive information technology, are learning, consuming, and collaborating with each other and where baby boomers are preparing to retire or switch careers over the next decade.\\"<br /><br />Hagel and Brown explain how to build a sustainable competitive advantage by focusing on three broad strategic imperatives: dynamic specialization, connectivity and coordination, and leveraged capability building. Of special interest to me is what they have to say about process outsourcing and offshoring, loose coupling of extended business processes, and what they call \\"productive friction.\\" Many of those who reads this book will derive substantial benefit from completing three \\"quick audits\\" (pages 26-29) because they will help those who comprise a senior management team to build a shared view of where their organization is. Only then can an appropriate strategy (or strategies) be formulated and then implemented to get that organization where it needs to be.<br /><br />By the way, according to research which Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton provide in The Strategy-Focused Organization, only 5% of the workforce understand their company's strategy, only 25% of managers have incentives linked to strategy, 60% of organizations don't link budgets to strategy, and 85% of executive teams spend less than one hour per month discussing strategy. If true, these are chilling statistics which suggest that few decision-makers in any organization (regardless of its size or nature) would be able to answer, clearly and realistically, questions such as these when completing a migration path audit:<br /><br />What have been the five most important operating initiatives -- based on resource commitments -- during the past twelve months?<br /><br />How to characterize each of the five initiatives in terms of its efficiency, specialization, coordination of third-party resources, and accelerating capability building across enterprises?<br /><br />Based on a calendar review of executive involvement, how much time was spent over the past twelve months discussing the four elements of each operating issue?<br /><br />Approximately what were the resources committed to these four elements across the five operating initiatives?<br /><br />When you next participate in a group discussion of strategic planning, ask questions such as these. The silence which follows will be almost deafening.<br /><br />As indicated earlier in this brief commentary, when Hagel and Brown refer to \\"the only sustainable edge,\\" they do so in terms of four separate but closely related dimensions. It is important to keep that in mind as you follow their narrative through seven chapters to the Epilogue. It is also helpful to remember that Hagel and Brown are intrigued by an often troublesome but irrevocable convergence as digital information technology expands both within the enterprise and beyond through global communication networks as public policy in diverse domains continues to shift and thereby intensify competition on a global scale.<br /><br />When formulating new approaches to developing strategy, Hagel and Brown suggest, first build alignment on the long-term direction of the company. (They pose three excellent questions on page 160. Can you answer them?) \\"To sustain a meaningful longer-term direction, explicitly identify what you will not do as a business. Most companies will probably shed areas of activities for which other firms have developed world-class capabilities.\\" Next, build alignment around near-term operating initiatives. (There are two more excellent questions on page 162.) Then identify and address major organizational barriers. Finally, create tight performance feedback loops. I think it would be a serious mistake to think that this recommended process is relevant only to larger organizations, especially those competing or at least operating on a global scale. The information and counsel they provide as well as the questions they pose will be of substantial value to decision-makers in any organization, whatever its size or nature.<br /><br />In their Epilogue, they shift their (and the reader's) attention to still another of those questions which are so easy to ask but so difficult to answer: How to recast public policy to develop talent? The suggestions they offer are eminently sensible and best revealed within the context created for them. Of special interest to me is the fact Hagel and Brown seem to function so effectively on both the macro and micro levels. Although they provide an abundance of specifics throughout their brilliant book, they always have the so-called Big Picture in mind. This is especially evident in the remarks with which they conclude The Only Sustainable Edge:<br /><br />\\"By focusing on talent development, policy makers can help individuals in their society more effectively realize their full potential. But the benefits extend far beyond this. Talent development, especially when situated in economic activity, can drive improved productivity and, in turn, enhance the standard of living in any society. Even more broadly, a focus on talent development helps attract highly motivated and creative people and provides them with the resources and time to develop a rich and evolving cultural and social environment. Talent development is an ongoing race, but those who lead the race will unleash passion and rewards that will make the race worth winning.\\"<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out the works co-authored by Kaplan and Norton (especially The Strategy-Focused Organization) as well as Don Mankin and Susan G. Cohen's Business Without Boundaries: An Action Framework for Collaborating Across Time, Distance, Organization, and Culture, Robert Simons' Levers of Organization Design: How Managers Use Accountability Systems For Greater Performance and Commitment, and Strategy Safari: A Guided Tour Through The Wilds of Strategic Management co-authored by Henry Mintzberg, Bruce Ahlstrand, and Joseph Lampel.blesome but irrevocable convergence as digital information technology expands both within the enterprise and beyond through global communication networks as public policy in diverse domains continues to shift and thereby intensify competition on a global scale.

How to describe it? The focus is on two fictional characters, Jack and Morena. However, their experiences illustrate core principles of salesmanship previously revealed and validated during rigorous interviews of hundreds of real-world corporate sales trainers, sales reps, sales managers, and especially purchasing professionals. (Many of them agreed to be identified and quoted in Buyer-Approved Selling.) We accompany Jack and Morena as they begin a 90-day probation period at BigCo.<br /><br />They and we soon learn that BigCo has no formal on-going sales training program, once rookie reps complete an intensive four-day orientation on product information and basic sales techniques. Hence the importance of Jack's neighbor, \\"a retired G.E. executive,\\" who serves as an unofficial but invaluable mentor to Jack throughout the narrative. It is he who provides copies of Buyer-Approved Selling which Jack and Morena immediately read. They then agree to work together, collaborating on a one-year plan based on the principles and techniques recommended in Buyer-Approved Selling. Their three initial goal areas are Cold Calls, Appointments, and Proposals.<br /><br />It would be a disservice to Schell as well as to those who have not as yet read this book to reveal more about Jack and Morena's shared and separate adventures in sales at BigCo. (I do suggest that Buyer-Approved Selling be read first, if possible.)  Obviously, they are literary devices by which to dramatize both the \\"sales secrets from the buyer's side of the desk\\" and what is described as \\"The Neighbor's Wisdom\\" (on pages 99-100). Although fictional characters, their experiences seem wholly authentic.<br /><br />I presume to offer one caveat: Beware of thinking that any one book on sales (or on anything else, for that matter) offers all of the information and advice you need. By all means read and then re-read Buyer-Approved Selling and this book. Absorb and digest the material they provide. (Redundancies re-inforce key points.) And then formulate a cohesive and comprehensive game plan for the next 12 months, setting specific goals and deadlines for each of the four quarters. Meanwhile, keep in mind that in a competitive marketplace, 20% produce 80% of the sales. Why? Because they concentrate on those cultivation and solicitation initiatives which produce 80% of the results they seek.<br /><br />Do you know why some people buy what you sell and others don't? Have you asked them? If and when you do, they will probably validate what the Marketshare Research Institute learned when conducting the research on which Buyer-Approved Selling is based. Now what? The choice is yours.. Absorb and digest the material they provide. (Redundancies re-inforce key points.)

Too often, the phrase \\"page-turner\\" is applied irresponsibly but not so when describing Nicolson's Seize the Fire. I read it from start to finish and now plan to do so again after re-reading Garrett Mattingly's The Armada. (There are striking similarities between the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 and Nelson's victory 217 years later.) Also John Sugden's Nelson: A Dream of Glory, 1758-1797, Andrew Lambert's Nelson: Britannia's God of War, and  Joel S. A. Hayward's For God and Glory: Lord Nelson and His Way of War.<br /><br />Briefly, here is some background information provided by Lambert.<br /><br />\\"During the engagement at Trafalgar, on 21 October 1805, the Royal Navy annihilated the greatest threat to British security for 200 years, but lost Britain's national hero in the process. Little wonder the battle transcended the mundane calculation of ships and men, victory and defeat. It guaranteed Britain's control of the oceans, the basis of her global power for over a century.<br /><br />\\"By 1805 Nelson was already a national hero, and considered the ultimate naval commander. His elevated conception of war ensured that every battle he fought was used to solve major strategic problems, and his many successes ensured he was the only contemporary to rival Bonaparte as ultimate exemplar of total war. Nor did Bonaparte disagree - he kept a bust of Nelson in his private quarters. Nelson developed the art of war at sea to the new, terrible form he characterised as 'annihilation' to counter the war effort of Napoleonic France. He did so by taking the command system of Admiral Sir John Jervis, the tough old officer who taught him how to keep a fleet efficient, and melding it with the genius for battle and strategy he developed while serving under Admiral Lord Hood.\\"<br /><br />Credit Nicolson with skillfully examining, step-by-step, the process by which Nelson and his associates engaged in and then achieved one of the greatest naval victories in history. According to Nicolson, \\"Navies reflect the societies from which they come.\\" In this instance, British meritocracy opposed by European aristocracy. Recalling Sun Tzu's observation in The Art of War that every battle is won or lost before it is fought, I soon realized that the outcome off Cape Trafalgar was inevitable. Napoleon's forces and those of his Spanish allies were no match for Nelson's \\"animal courage\\" as well as his leadership skills, in combination with his uncommonly loyal officers and men. For them, \\"Victory [was] neither a luxury nor an ornament, It [was] a compulsion and a necessity.\\" Their decisive killing ratio (approximately 1-10) without losing a single ship suggests just how skilled and determined as well as violent the British were. Of course, they were aided by the fact that they could fire a cannon round every 90 seconds whereas their opponents required five minutes to do so during what Nelson intended to be \\"pell-mell\\" combat. Nicolson is at his best when describing it in compelling detail. For example, the reader learns that that those killed were then tossed overboard to keep the decks clear (a fate which the dying Nelson feared), and, that an \\"iron wind\\" of cannonballs filled the air causing many of them to collide. For me, the highlight of this book is Nicolson's sensitive description of the fatally wounded Nelson as his death approached. \\"Thank God, I have done my duty.\\" He had indeed.<br /><br />When concluding, Nicolson suggests that Trafalgar must be understood in terms of \\"the uncompromising violence; the dedicated grip on the need for `annihilation'; the seeking of victory through exsanguination; combined with a hunger for honor; a belief in the reality of noble ideas; self-possession as a mark of nobility; and behind all that a  tender and active humanity.\\" What occurred on October 21, 1805, was\\"a brutal amalgam and remains an inheritance with a  troubling moral ambiguity at its heart.\\" What can be certain is that the victory on that day denied Napoleon his intended invasion. For the next century or so, Britannia then ruled the waves.<br /><br />To whom do I strongly recommend this book? My list includes those who have read and enjoyed Patrick O'Brian's novels in the Aubrey/Maturin series; those who share my high regard for the film Master and Commander, directed by Peter Weir and starring Russell Crowe as Captain Jack Aubrey, based on two of O'Brian's novels (Master and Commander and The Far Side of the World); and those who share my high regard for the eleven novels in C.S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower series. Who else? Others who prefer non-fiction, more specifically military history, which is thoroughly researched and eloquently presented.

Let's begin with the assumption that many (if not most but certainly not all) limits are self-imposed. Then let us assume that it is in any organization's best interests to eliminate all limits to effective communication, cooperation, and collaboration. If you accept these two assumptions, then you will share my high regard for this volume in which Mankin and Cohen offer a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective four-phase \\"action framework\\" to achieve \\"collaboration [as well as communication and cooperation] across time, distance, organization, and culture.\\" To their credit, they concentrate almost entirely on explaining HOW to apply basic principles, citing  benchmark examples which include the John Deere Construction & Forestry Technology Program, Radica Games Group, and Solectron Corporation.<br /><br />Obviously, all organizations have boundaries and many of them are essential to achieving success. For example, non-negotiable values to which everyone involved is held accountable. Without appropriate behavior, there would be chaos. Also, there are limits on available resources which means that priorities must be set and then served. No organization can afford to be everything to everyone associated with it. Boundaries are inevitable. That said, Mankin and Cohen assert -- and I wholly agree -- that there is an interdependence of structure and relationships which can enable any organization (regardless of size or nature) to collaborate effectively, and do so \\"across time, distance, organization, and culture.\\" The core concept of this book is a metaprinciple which is explained in Chapter One. With exquisite care, Mankin and Cohen use an especially apt metaphor -- jazz -- to illustrate how the metaprinciple provides the \\"theme\\" and the action framework (please see pages 5-8 and Chapters Seven and Eight) provides the \\"score.\\" Extending the metaphor, Mankin and Cohen urge their reader to use the theme to improvise on the framework and create collaboration within her or his own organization and such efforts will \\"transcend all boundaries to produce deeply fulfilling performances.\\"<br /><br />Not all of those who read this book will be willing and able to make and then sustain the commitment required.

For that reason, I commend Branham on the fact that he devotes most of his attention to explaining HOW to establish and then increase the appeal of an organization that people want to work for, how to hire the right people in the first place, how to get new hires off to a great start, and how to use effective coaching and appropriate rewards to sustain their commitment.

She locates them throughout the United States, visits them, has lengthy conversations with them, and then shares her experiences (and theirs) in this book. I am impressed by the nature and extent of the variety of differences between and among the 25 as well as the nature and extent of differences between them and two other, more famous men who share their name. Mattia is to be commended on the care with which she organizes and then presents the material. Least Heat-Moon enables his readers to explore the byways and rivers with him as he travels throughout the United States. Mattia enables her own readers to explore the hearts, minds, and souls of 25 fellow human beings who share the same name, obviously, but who reveal their individuality with style, grace, and eloquence.

Also, I agree with Oliver Wendell Holmes who once observed, \\"I wouldn't give a fig for the simplicity this side of complexity but I'd give my life for the simplicity on the far side of complexity.\\"<br /><br />Would Canfield's The Successful Principles simply be an expanded explanation of how to achieve success by consuming a bowl of chicken soup one spoonful at a time, by eating a whale one bite at a time, etc? No, it is not. On the contrary. Invoking the metaphor of a journey, Canfield offers a variation on the familiar aphorism, \\"If you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there.\\" With Jane Switzer, he provides a cohesive and comprehensive program for those who are determined to achieve ambitious objectives, not only in their careers but in all other areas of their lives. Now here's the variation: \\"If you don't know what you want, your efforts will have no focus...and inevitably fail.\\" People must first decide what they want, what they REALLY want.<br /><br />The material is carefully organized and developed within six separate but interdependent sections. Canfield recommends 64 \\"commitments\\" and I wholly agree that the first is absolutely essential: Take 100% responsibility for your life. Those unwilling and/or unable to make and then sustain that commitment really cannot achieve their ambitious objectives, whatever they may be. In the first section, \\"The Fundamentals of Success,\\" Canfield offers 24 of what he calls \\"building blocks.\\" He then proceeds to examine what must be done to \\"transform\\" one's self to achieve success while building a support system which consists of mutually beneficial relationships with others. In Section V, \\"Success and Money,\\" he offers specific suggestions with regard to the prudent but productive process by which to obtain and then increase net worth. (There are no head-snapping revelations in this section. Its greatest value lies in the clarity and simplicity with which Canfield discusses various strategies and tactics.) He concludes with what is really a game plan which each reader must formulate to apply the success principles already explained in the previous five sections. I especially appreciate the provision of all manner of free resources which are readily available to each reader. (Please see pages 437-440.) There is also a \\"Suggested Reading and Additional Resources for Success\\" section.<br /><br />While offering so much food for thought and (especially) for positive action, Canfield enhances its appeal with some \\"seasoning\\" provided by hundreds of quotations throughout the narrative. For example:<br /><br />\\"The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex, overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and the starting on the first one.\\" (Mark Twain)<br /><br />\\"Every negative event contains within it the seed of an equal or greater benefit.\\" (Napoleon Hill)<br /><br />\\"If you want to be happy, set a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy, and inspires your hopes.\\" (Andrew Carnegie)<br /><br />\\"Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life's coming attractions.\\" (Albert Einstein)<br /><br />\\"Believe and act as if it were impossible to fail.\\" (Charles F. Kettering)<br /><br />\\"Things may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle.\\" (Abraham Lincoln)<br /><br />\\"It is not the will to win that matters -- everyone has that. It is the will to prepare to win that matters.\\" (Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant)<br /><br />\\"It's never crowded along the extra mile.\\" (Wayne Dyer)<br /><br />\\"You can get anything in life you want if you will just help other people get what they want.\\" (Zig Ziglar)<br /><br />However, all of the material in this book (including Canfield's) is essentially worthless unless and until a reader makes and then sustains a full commitment to assume 100% responsibility for her or his life...and then decides precisely what she or he REALLY wants to achieve.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Michael Ray's The Highest Goal, Jim O'Toole's Creating the Good Life, David Whyte's The Heart Aroused, and The Oz Principle co-authored by Roger Connors, Tom Smith, and Craig Hickman.less unless and until a reader makes and then sustains a full commitment to assume 100% responsibility for her or his life...and then decides precisely what she or he REALLY wants to achieve.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Michael Ray's The Highest Goal, Jim O'Toole's Creating the Good Life, David Whyte's The Heart Aroused, and The Oz Principle co-authored by Roger Connors, Tom Smith, and Craig Hickman.	2005-09-05

In it, Neumeier develops in greater depth several basic ideas about how to bridge a gap between business strategy and design. My own experience suggests that on occasion, there may be a conflict or misalignment rather than a \\"gap.\\" Or the business strategy is inappropriate. Or the design concepts are wrong-headed. Or the execution fails. Whatever, Neumeier correctly notes that \\"A lot of people talk about it. Yet very few people understand it. Even fewer know how to manage it. Still, everyone wants it. What is it? Branding. of course -- arguably the most powerful business tool since the spreadsheet.\\" What Neumeier offers is a \\"30,000-foot view of brand: what it is (and isn't), why it works (and doesn't), and most importantly, how to bridge the gap between logic and magic to build a sustainable competitive advantage.\\"  Of course, that assumes that both logic and magic are present and combined...or at least within close proximity of each other.<br /><br />As others have already indicated, Neumeier provides a primer (\\"the least amount of information necessary\\") rather than a textbook. His coverage is not definitive, nor intended to be. He has a crisp writing style, complemented by \\"the shorthand of the conference room\\" (i.e. illustrations, diagrams, and summaries). Some describe his book an \\"easy read\\" but I do not. When reading short and snappy books such as this one, I have learned that certain insights resemble depth charges or time capsules: they have a delayed but eventually significant impact. For example, Neumeier explains why \\"Three Little Questions\\" can bring a high-level marketing meeting to a screeching halt:<br /><br />1. Who are you?<br /><br />2. What do you do?<br /><br />3. Why does it matter?<br /><br />I also want to express my admiration of the book's design features. They create an appropriate visual context within which Neumeier examines each of five \\"Disciplines\\": differentiation, collaboration, innovation, validation, and cultivation. Expect no head-snapping revelations. For many of those who read this book, its greatest value will will be derived from reiteration of certain core concepts which Neumeier reviews with uncommon clarity and concision. Check out the \\"Take-Home Lessons\\" (pages 149-157) which include<br /><br />\\"A brand is a person's gut feeling about a product, service, or company. It's not what you say it is. It's what THEY say it is.\\"<br /><br />\\"Differentiation has evolved from a focus on `what it is,' to `what it does,' to 'how you'll feel,' to `who you are.' While features, benefits, and price are still important to people, experiences and personal identity are even more important.\\"<br /><br />\\"How do you know when an idea is innovative? When it scares the hell out of you.\\"<br /><br />Readers having relatively less experience with the branding process will especially appreciate the provision of an expanded (220-word) \\"Brand Glossary.\\" Neumeier also includes a \\"Recommended Reading\\" section in which he briefly comments on each source. When reading business books, I much prefer annotated bibliographies such as Neumeier's to mere lists. For whatever reasons, many provide neither.ration, innovation, validation, and cultivation.

Until reading Sunday Money, I had little interest in books about motorsport racing in general, and about NASCAR in particular. However, since childhood, I have had a keen interest in books which focus on adventures during a journey of some kind. Homer's Odyssey, for example, and Cervantes' Don Quixote. More recently, William Least Heat-Moon's Blue Highways and River Horse. To me, such books are like \\"magic carpets\\" which transport me to unfamiliar cultures and often to distant centuries. That said, Sunday Money is one of the most entertaining as well as most informative books I have read in recent years. MacGregor and his wife (an award-winning photographer) committed ten months and a small fortune to traveling almost 50,000 miles throughout the United States inorder to observe a complete NASCAR racing season first-hand. As I began to read this book, these were the questions of greatest interest to me:<br /><br />1. What were the origins of NASCAR?<br /><br />2. What have been the most significant developments since then?<br /><br />3. Most people observe NASCAR races on television or at a distance from the on-track competition. What did the MacGregors (especially Jeff) learn about NASCAR racing which can only be experienced \\"up close and personal\\"?<br /><br />4. Why has NASCAR racing become so popular?<br /><br />5. What are the most common misconceptions about it and those who are so devoted to it?<br /><br />6. In MacGregor's opinion, what does NASCAR reveal about our society?<br /><br />7. What were the MacGregors' fondest memories of their 35-state journey?<br /><br />8. How do male and female perspectives on NASCAR racing differ?<br /><br />9. Why does NASCAR racing remain \\"overwhelmingly, blindingly white\\"?<br /><br />10. For those who have not as yet driven a competition car, what's it like?<br /><br />MacGregor answers each of these and other questions for those who know little and care less about motorsport racing. My guess (only a guess) is that several are the same questions which MacGregor had when he and his wife began their journey of exploration and discovery within the NASCAR World. It was a pleasure to tag along with them.xploration and discovery within the NASCAR World. It was a pleasure to tag along with them.	2005-08-15

Whiddon wrote it  (with Lance Alston)  \\"for investors who are frustrated with the constant barrage of confusing and conflicting investment information, hit-and-miss approaches, and exaggerated return claims. It was written for those who are tired of having the worries of their financial future rob them of their life's present. For all who ever thought the odds were stacked against them in the investing game, Wealth Without Worry will change all that.\\" That is indeed a bold claim. Whether or not it proves true depends on several factors over which Whiddon has no control. They include an investor's willingness and ability to (a) absorb and digest the contents of this book, (b) identify her or his specific investment objectives, (c) rigorously evaluate or re-evaluate initiatives to-date to achieve those objectives, and then (d) make whatever adjustments may be necessary, not only of specific investment strategies and tactics but also of her or his own values, motives, personality, and character.<br /><br />Here are some of the questions to which Whiddon responds:<br /><br />1. What are Wall Street's most popular methods of portfolio management?<br /><br />2. Specifically what is active management?<br /><br />3. Why and to what extent is active management misaligned with the best interests of individual investors?<br /><br />4. When chasing returns, why do so many investors \\"arrive at the party late\\"?<br /><br />5. What to consider before selecting the most appropriate investment help?<br /><br />6. Which services should the advisor be required to provide?<br /><br />7. How can the \\"Seven Essential Questions to Ask When Interviewing an Advisor\\" (pages 61-67) assist making an appropriate selection?<br /><br />8. Why are \\"market returns there for the taking...by not succumbing to the Wall Street shell games\\"?<br /><br />9. How to assemble and then manage a \\"proper portfolio\\" of investments?<br /><br />10. Given the responses to the previous nine questions, which three action items should be pursued immediately? Why?<br /><br />In an article article published in the Dallas Morning News (July 31, 2005), Scott Burns notes that in their book, Whiddon and Alston \\"point out that a simple diversified index portfolio consisting of four basic index funds (20 percent S&P 500, 20 [percent Russell 2000, 20 percent MSCI EAFE and 40 percent Lehman intermediate government bond) would have returned 12.7 percent a year during the 25 years from 1979 through 2004.\\" Burns goes on to explain why that's \\"a pretty good return.\\" The 80:20 Market Return Portfolio which Whiddon and Alston recommend includes only 20% committed to fixed income. It \\"crushed\\" the returns earned by active managers, returning a \\"whopping\\" 14.29 percent...and did so with less market risk. The obvious conclusion is that an index portfolio will almost always outperform a managed portfolio because, as Alston explained to Burns, \\"With one quarter of the portfolio in one asset class, you might have a chance to outperform with one good fund. But with 15 asset classes, it simply can't happen.\\"<br /><br />Whiddon and Alston insist that the Market Portfolio Fund enables an investor to \\"own the market...own the entire casino....[and] own capitalism, which has been successful since it was created.\\" Another bold claim. Obviously, those who read this book must decide for themselves whether or not this is an appropriate investment strategy. My own opinion is that, at the least, it is one worthy of careful consideration.br /> <br />10.

For present purposes, let's segment individual investors within three categories:<br /><br />1. Some prepare themselves to make their own investment decisions. It is noteworthy that Amazon now offers 3,634 books in the general category of \\"investing.\\"<br /><br />2.  Others retain the services of an intermediary (investment agent or firm).<br /><br />3. And still others fully entrust their funds to institutional investors (e.g. TIAA/CREF).<br /><br />Prentis seems to have written this book primarily for persons such as I who can be classified within one or both of the first two categories. Then president of Harvard, Derek Bok, once observed \\"If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.\\" Prentis presumably agrees with Bok. He carefully studied 37 primary sources, most (if not all) considered \\"classics\\" among the 3,634 investment books now in print and he then combined what he learned from them with what he had also learned during his own career. The result is this book. In it, he recommends seven basic \\"principles\\" which are best revealed within the narrative; more importantly, within the context (i.e. frame-of-reference) he carefully establishes for each. To me, Prentis' key points concerning \\"astute\\" investors are that<br /><br />They are life-long learners. Only then can they make (or agree to) each investment decision based on the best information available.<br /><br />They trust their decisions and have confidence in them unless and until there is overwhelming, verifiable evidence to the contrary.<br /><br />They constantly analyze their investments, meticulously calculating the current status of each.<br /><br />They have \\"the courage of their convictions\\" but also possess the courage to make (or specify) modification(s) of their investment(s) when there is overwhelming, verifiable evidence that such action is necessary. Astute investors appreciate the fact that there are situations when it takes greater courage to do nothing than it does to buy or sell.<br /><br />They also understand that rigorously enlightened judgment always trumps so-called \\"scientific\\" research and \\"hard data\\" as well as any one mathematical formula or calculation.<br /><br />Most individual investors will welcome Prentis' brief but sufficient coverage in Part 1 of investing principles and strategies; investment theory and practice; equity and bond fundamentals; stock market technical analysis; trading psychology; intrinsic, market, and bargain values; interest rate principles; interpreting the news; \\"Being Contrarian\\"; and \\"The Ten-Step Method For Investing Success.\\" Then in Part 2, Prentis discusses retirement planning and then discounted capital market theory followed by a Conclusion, Glossary,  Bibliography, and Index.<br /><br />Basic stuff? Of course. Any head-snapping revelations? None which I (at least) encountered. However, I rate this book so highly because the material is  intentionally fundamental but solid and well-organized. It soon becomes obvious that Prentis is attempting to share everything he knows (including what he has learned from others) so that both the information and counsel provided will help each of his readers to become an \\"astute\\" investor and thereby a successful one.reciate the fact that there are situations when it takes greater courage to do nothing than it does to buy or sell.

I also appreciate the fact that its co-authors explain why their book was written, what its key points are, and how its material has been organized. According to Davila, Epstein, and Shelton: \\"The truth is that there is not much that is truly new about innovation. The basics have not changed for centuries. However, we have become smarter about managing innovation.\\" There is a compelling need in 2005 to view it from different perspectives. The co-authors suggest three:<br /><br />\\"Innovation, like many [other] business functions, is a management process that requires specific tools, rules and discipline -- it is not mysterious.\\"<br /><br />\\"Innovation requires [accurate] measurement and [generous] rewards to deliver sustained, high yield.\\"<br /><br />\\"Companies can use innovation to redefine an industry by employing combinations of business model innovation and technology innovation.\\"<br /><br />It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of these three separate but interdependent perspectives when attempting (struggling?) to determine how to manage, measure, and profit from innovation. The co-authors have obviously done some innovative thinking about innovation, especially in terms of its practical applications. The most valuable business books tend to be those whose narrative is driven by a question. In Jim Collins' Good to Great, \\"How can a good company become a great company?\\" In Jason Jennings' Think Big, Act Small, \\"What traits do America's best performing companies share?\\" In this book, the co-authors seem to be primarily interested in answering two questions: \\"Why is innovation a necessary ingredient for sustained success?\\" and \\"Why is innovation an integral part of [any] business?\\" When responding to these two questions from the three aforementioned perspectives, they reveal the most effective strategies and tactics for managing, measuring, and profiting from innovation.<br /><br />There is overwhelming evidence that almost all process simplification initiatives have failed. Why? Several reasons but the most common one seems to be that the process by which change agents attempted to simplify process was itself too complicated. \\"Old wine in new bottles\\" is still old wine. As with process simplification, the ultimate result -- quality of wine -- also requires a sequence of initiatives and is determined by many factors which include ingredients (i.e. grapes), soil, climate, timing, etc. The same is true of innovation initiatives. I wholly agree with the co-authors that \\"how you innovate determines what you innovate.\\" So to repeat: In 2005, there is a compelling need to view innovation from different perspectives. In other words, to think innovatively about innovation. Obviously, easier said than done. Much easier. Those initiatives are most effective when they involve communication, cooperation, and collaboration between and among everyone involved. Hence the importance of what Davila, Epstein, and Shelton offer in this book.<br /><br />As I read their informative and thought-provoking book, I was again reminded of the fact that the same principles which they cite and then explain have -- for decades -- guided and informed the pragmatic innovation of countless teams and even communities. For example, those which Warren Bennis and Patricia Ward Biederman examine in their book, Creating Genius: the Disney studios which produced so many animation classics; Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) which developed the first personal computer; Apple Computer which then took it to market; those in the so-called \\"War Room\\" who helped to elect Bill Clinton President in 1992; the so-called \\"Skunk Works\\" where so many of Lockheed's greatest designs were formulated; Black Mountain College which \\"wasn't simply a place where creative collaboration took place\\" for the artists in residence from 1933 to 1956, \\"it was about creative collaboration\\"; and Los Alamos (NM) and the University of Chicago where the Manhattan Project eventually produced a new weapon called \\"the Gadget.\\"<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out the aforementioned Organizing Genius as well as Evan I. Schwartz's Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors; three volumes in the Harvard Business Review Paperback Series on Breakthrough Thinking, Innovation, and The Innovative Enterprise; Tom Kelley's The Art of Innovation: Lessons in Creativity from IDEO, America's Leading Design Firm; Seeing What's Next: Using Theories of Innovation to Predict Industry Change co-authored by Clayton M.

Each offers a concise rather than comprehensive, much less definitive biography. However, just as Al Hirschfeld's illustrations of various celebrities capture their defining physical characteristics, the authors of books in this series focus on the defining influences and developments during the lives and careers of their respective subjects. In this instance, George Balanchine.<br /><br />Credit Gottlieb with attracting and then generously rewarding the interest of readers such as I who previously knew very little (if anything) about Balanchine. Even a summary of the key biographical details suggests that his life and career were extraordinary. The subtitle of this compact biography correctly but insufficiently describes him as \\"The Ballet Maker.\\" True, Balanchine created a total of at least 425 ballets but it is much more important to note that according those best qualified to do so, during his lifetime and then since his death (on April 30, 1983), Balanchine is described as the greatest choreographer.<br /><br />Because there is already an abundance of information about Balanchine readily available from The George Balanchine Foundation ([...]) and other excellent sources, Gottlieb wisely and brilliantly focuses on what seems to him to be most remarkable about a man for whom \\"teaching was the heart and soul of his enterprise -- he was frequently quoted as saying that he would be remembered first and foremost as a teacher, not as a choreographer, [his] school now firmly in place as the premier training ground for ballet dancers in America. It taught the basics the way he wanted them taught, and he was secure in the competence of his teachers, who through the years included important dancers from his Russian past.\\" He taught by example, by demonstration, not be words.<br /><br />But it is also true that Balanchine could \\"explain a step or role with a simple image that would uncannily convey his intentions.\\" Here are two examples from one of his greatest creative achievements, The Prodigal:<br /><br />When explaining to the Prodigal's drinking companions how they should run their fingers up and down his (the Prodigal's) exhausted, nearly naked body as if to strip it further of worldly goods: \\"Like mice.\\"<br /><br />When explaining to the Prodigal what to do when the Siren steps off of his legs as he lowers them to the floor: \\"You lower her like an elevator.\\"<br /><br />According to Nathan Milstein, Balanchine \\"left an inheritance that consists of more than his works. He left his moral example, a considerable legacy: the strength and wholeness of his character; his directness, adherence to principle, and lack of greed....his devotion to his art; his independence of fashion, fame, and trappings of success.\\"<br /><br />I am grateful to Gottlieb for so much. First, for helping me to understand and appreciate a man who \\"carried within him all of ballet, past and present, and was constantly redefining its future. Looking backward and forward were not separate matters for him; he summed up everything even as he was reinventing everything.\\" I am also grateful to Gottlieb for obtaining permission to reprint an article written by Balanchine, \\"Mr. B Talks About Ballet,\\" which appeared in the June 11, 1965, issue of Life magazine. As Gottlieb explains, it is one of Balanchine's very few by-lined articles.

Jefferson [in italics] was [end italics] contradiction, and this will be found at every step of the narrative that goes to make up his life.\\" It is remarkable to me that Hitchens was able to cover so much which occurred from Jefferson's birth into relative wealth on April 13, 1743, until his death on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence of which he was its principal author. Early on, Hitchens acknowledges what he calls an \\"opaque curtain\\" which so often frustrates efforts to \\"see\\" Jefferson clearly at various stages throughout his life. Early in the narrative,  Hitchens cites several of young Jefferson's social \\"fiascos\\" such as a crass and unsuccessful attempt to seduce the wife of a close friend. Why? First, because they demonstrate that \\"Jefferson was ardent by nature when it came to females, and also made reticent and cautious by experience.\\" Also, because generations of historians have written, \\"until the present day, as if [Jefferson] were not a male mammal at all.\\" Later, Hitchens rigorously examines Jefferson's (yes, contradictory) relationship with Sally Hemings. First, he guides his reader briskly but without haste through Jefferson's youth, education (College of William and Mary), several years of practicing law, and then the initial phase of his public service when elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses (1769-75). Jefferson aligned himself with the revolutionary faction, writing A Summary View of the Rights of British America (1774) which helps to explain, somewhat, his ambivalent attitude toward the colonies' deteriorating relationship with Britain's monarch and parliament. In 1770 he began designing and building Monticello to which (in 1772) he brought his new wife, Martha Wyles Skelton. She bore him six children, only two of whom survived into maturity. She died in 1782.<br /><br />Jefferson was among those who called the First Continental Congress (1774) and as a delegate to the Second Congress (1775-7), he was primarily responsible for drafting the Declaration of Independence which was adopted on July 4, 1776. He then returned to Virginia where, as a member of its legislature (1776-9) and led efforts to create a state constitution,then served as governor (1779-81), during which time he proposed that Virginia abolish the slave trade and assure religious freedom. His proposals were rejected. In 1789 George Washington appointed Jefferson secretary of state. In that position he became head of the liberal Democratic-Republican faction (as it was then called) and opposed the more conservative Federalist policies of Hamilton, Madison, and Washington.<br /><br />He resigned as secretary of state at the end of 1793 to devote himself to his estate at Monticello. At that time, arguably the most eloquent spokesman for the ideals of the Enlightenment, Jefferson owned about 125-150 slaves, treating them as property because he regarded Africans as inferior beings. In 1796 he was elected vice-president under Federalist John Adams. Four years later, he defeated Adams and Aaron Burr for the presidency. For reasons which are not entirely clear, his arch rival, Hamilton, supported him when the Electoral College vote was tied. The greatest achievements during the Jeffersonian presidency are the defeat of the Barbary pirates which allowed maritime commerce to flourish, the Louisiana Purchase which more than doubled the size of the new nation, and the Lewis and Clark Expedition which generated an abundance of valuable information to guide and inform the inevitable westward expansion. Jefferson retired to Monticello in 1809, concentrating on his scholarly and scientific interests while helping to found the University of Virginia (1825). He designed its campus as well as the Virginia state capitol and several mansions. In 1813 he began what became an extended and remarkably cordial exchange of letters with his former political adversary, John Adams. Both died on the same day, July 4th, 1826.<br /><br />Here are a few brief excerpts which, I hope, provide at least some indication of Hitchens' brilliant achievement:<br /><br />On Jefferson and Thomas Paine: Both \\"had the gift of pithily summarizing what was already understood, and then of moving an already mobilized audience to follow an inexorable logic. But they also had to overcome an insecurity and indecision that is difficult for us, employing retrospect, to comprehend.\\"<br /><br />Re the Enlightenment: \\"Jefferson was not a man of the Enlightenment only in the ordinary sense that he believed in reason or perhaps in rationality. He was very specifically one of those who believed that human redemption lay in education, discovery, innovation, and experiment.\\"<br /><br />On rebellion: In a letter to Abigail Adams, Jefferson observed that \\"The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions, that I wish it to be always kept alive. It will often be exercised when wrong, but better so than not be exercised at all. I like a little rebellion now and then. It is like a storm in the atmosphere.\\"<br /><br />Then later, after learning of the bloodshed associated with (Daniel) Shays' Rebellion, in a letter to Adams's son-in-law, William Smith: \\"What signify a few lives lost in a generation or two? The tree of liberty must from time to time be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure.\\"<br /><br />In response, Hitchens suggests that \\"the key word here must be not `patriots' but `tyrants' -- since the only candidate for the latter description was the government that Jefferson was [at that time] serving as an ambassador.\\"<br /><br />Later, when commenting on the campaign of 1796, Hitchens notes that \\"Despite Jefferson's almost Olympian detachment from the process, he was subjected to a series of vitriolic assaults by poster and pamphlet, accusing him of being an atheist, an abolitionist, and a sympathizer with bloody-handed Jacobinism. The element of truth in all three accusations is retrospectively amusing. given their authors' failure to appreciate Jefferson's patent genius for compromise.\\"<br /><br />As these and other portions of Hitchens' narrative indicate, Jefferson \\"contained sufficient `multitudes,' in Whitman's phrase [from Song of Myself], to contradict himself with scope and generosity. He ranged himself on many sides of many questions, from government interference with the press to congressional authority over expenditures, and from the maintenance of permanent armed forces to the persistence in foreign entanglements....At the end, his capitulation to a slave power that he half-abominated was both self-interested and a menace to the survival of the republic. This surrender, by a man of the Enlightenment and a man of truly revolutionary and democratic temperament, is another reminder that history is a tragedy and not a morality play.\\"<br /><br />Thank you, Christopher Hitchens, for writing Why Orwell Matters and now this biography of Thomas Jefferson because, in doing so, you have helped me to appreciate even more the wisdom of Voltaire's suggestion that we cherish those who seek the truth but beware of those who find it.abundance of valuable information to guide and inform the inevitable westward expansion.

What are the defining qualities and characteristics of \\"the new breed of innovator\\"?<br /><br />2. Why is innovation `the only approach to differentiation\\"?<br /><br />3. What does the process of innovation involve, indeed require?<br /><br />4. How best to identify relevant and significant trends?<br /><br />5. Then, how to respond to these trends as especially important opportunities?<br /><br />6. How can (and should) innovation respond to human needs, interests, and even fantasies?<br /><br />7. What is a \\"Powers of 10\\" analysis and why can its revelations be so valuable?<br /><br />8. Why is B2B innovation the \\"new frontier of fantasy\\"?<br /><br />9. How to plan and then implement a successful product development process?<br /><br />10. How to establish and then nourish an innovation culture?<br /><br />In the Epilogue, the authors review various \\"powers of innovation,\\"  reaffirming that those who comprise the \\"new breed\\" embrace the principles and ideas of pragmatic innovation: \\"an interdisciplinary collaboration, a structured process of exploration, a balance between art and science, [and] a focus on experience and fantasy.\\" These are the otherwise ordinary people who will, together, \\"design the extraordinary things to come.\\"<br /><br />As I read this informative and thought-provoking book, I was again reminded of the fact that the same principles which Vogel, Cagan, and Boatwright cite and then explain have -- for decades -- guided and informed the \\"pragmatic innovation\\" of countless teams and even communities. For example, those which Warren Bennis and Patricia Ward Biederman examine in their book, Creating Genius: the Disney studios which produced so many animation classics; Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) which developed the first personal computer; Apple Computer which then took it to market; those in the so-called \\"War Room\\" who helped to elect Bill Clinton President in 1992; the so-called \\"Skunk Works\\" where so many of Lockheed's greatest designs were formulated; Black Mountain College which \\"wasn't simply a place where creative collaboration took place\\" for the artists in residence from 1933 to 1956, \\"it was about creative collaboration\\"; and Los Alamos (NM) and the University of Chicago where the Manhattan Project eventually produced a new weapon called \\"the Gadget.\\"<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out the aforementioned Organizing Genius as well as Evan I.

Each offers a concise rather than comprehensive, much less definitive biography. However, just as Al Hirschfeld's illustrations of various celebrities capture their defining physical characteristics, the authors of books in this series focus on the defining influences and developments during the lives and careers of their respective subjects. In this instance, George Washington.<br /><br />Johnson observes that \\"As the central actor in the American Revolution, George Washington was one of the most important figures in world history. As America's commander in chief throughout the eight-year struggle against Britain he effectively liberated the thirteen colonies from imperial rule. He then presided over the process whereby the new nation drafted, ratified, and enacted its Federal Constitution. Finally, for eight years he directed the administration that put the Constitution to work, with such success that, suitably updated and amended, it has lasted for nearly a quarter of a millennium.\\"<br /><br />That said, Johnson goes on to point out that Washington remains a remote and mysterious figure. \\"He puzzled those who knew and worked with him, and who often disagreed violently about his merits and abilities. He puzzles us. No man's mind is so hard to enter and dwell within. Everyone agreed, and agrees, he was a paragon. But a rich or empty one? A titan of flesh and blood or a clockwork figure programmed to do wisely?\\" Within only 123 pages, Johnson responds to these and other questions.<br /><br />Of special interest to me is the interdependence of Washington's ambitions with those of the thirteen colonies which he led to military victory and then to constitutional federation. Throughout his adult life, Washington was driven by \\"the paramountcy of land\\" and his notion of \\"interest.\\" He wanted to own, manage, and develop as much acreage as possible. This would increase his net worth, of course, but also establish for him important connections (i.e. through family ties, friendship, local ties, or clan) \\"which put a man ahead of his immediate competitors in getting something he wanted -- a place, a promotion, a contract, a favor.\\" Although Washington had hoped to avoid it, he eventually realized that the separation of America from Britain served both his own and the colonies' best interests. \\"To Washington, the sealing of the open frontier to the west was the fundamental reason for resisting Britain, but was also symptomatic of the conflict of rights between colonial assemblies and Westminster.\\" Hence the significance of the Stamp Act (1765) and then the Declaratory Act (1766).<br /><br />I was also interested in what Johnson has to say about another aspect of Washington's multi-faceted personality. \\"It is true that he was a bit of an actor. He liked to play the Old Man card when needed. He did his little scenes, as when addressing officers at Newburgh, of fumbling for his glasses and repeating: `I have already grown grey in the service of my country -- now I am growing blind.' He also pretended to lose his temper. Jefferson, who was taken in, said he was `tremendous in his wrath.' If ever his character was impugned in cabinet he would `By God them,' saying `he would rather be on his farm than be made Emperor of the World, by God!'\\"<br /><br />Washington owned as many as 300 slaves at one time but hated chattel slavery and when writing his will as death approached, he provided for the liberation of all of his slaves. He was passionately committed to the strict separation of church and state as specified by the First Amendment even as all \\"of his codes of morals, order, and propriety were rooted in Christianity, which he saw as the greatest civilizing force the world had ever known.\\" Washington was by all accounts a patrician who, when he died, owned $530,000 in land and stock alone, making him one of the richest men in America. Nonetheless, he was determined to improve the standard of living and quality of life for those less fortunate. Hence the importance to him of \\"fast, extensive, cheap, safe, and reliable travel\\" by which to accelerate the settlement and development of the rich agricultural land he had once surveyed on the far side of the mountains, \\"and to work it with modern English farming methods.\\" Washington was a devout believer in what was later characterized, in the 1840s, as Manifest Destiny.<br /><br />I hope the provision of excerpts in this brief commentary will help those who read it to gain at least a sense of Johnson's crisp, concise, and eloquent discussion of someone who was indeed a paragon of paradox.ty of life for those less fortunate.

I thought about that comment as I began to read Carbone's book. If Buffett's right (and I think he is), the key to getting customers to come back \\"again and again\\" is to create for them a purchase experience whose importance includes but is by no means limited to their perception of  price relative to value. What else? Carbone: \\"The tangible attributes of a product or service have far less influence on consumer preference than the unconscious sensory and emotional elements derived from the total experience.\\" He goes on to point out that creating value around multi-dimensional, well-integrated, and consciously managed experiences involves connecting with \\"the unconscious emotional passions of your customers and in the process, you'll discover how to differentiate yourself from competitors in ways that can be almost impossible to copy and commoditize.\\" I agree.<br /><br />In Part I, Carbone makes a case for experience management and then, in Part II, explains HOW to do that effectively. In chapters 7-11, he rigorously examines five separate but interdependent disciplines, devoting a separate chapter to each. I especially appreciate his provision of basic questions. For example, here are three which must be answered by application of the Discipline of Assessing Experience:<br /><br />1. What potential impact does managing customer experiences represent for the organization?<br /><br />2. How is the experiential value currently being created for customers?<br /><br />3. What resources are available to improve and optimize the way your organization creates experience value?<br /><br />The other four Disciplines involve auditing, designing, implementing, and stewarding experiences. Again, Carbone includes for each a cluster of \\"basic\\" questions to be answered or areas on which to focus. I also appreciate Carbone's provision of all manner of check-lists, guidelines, and caveats as well as \\"Figures\\" which enable his reader to concentrate on both core principles of customer experience management and effective application of them. Throughout the book, he inserts italicized comments such as these:<br /><br />\\"No one competence, discipline, or tool will be a universal silver bullet; rather it is the experience management counterpart to Disney's coveted `pixie dust.' It's the innovative blending of numerous perspectives and competencies that unlocks the full potential of experiential value creation.\\" (Page 117)<br /><br />\\"Designing experiences begins with the customer and ends with the customer. When clues are aligned with the customer's known desires and emotional needs, distinctive experiential value is being created. When they're not in harmony, conflicts occur and the value created is eroded.\\" (page 190)<br /><br />\\"The clues your customers place in the positive zone today may someday be neutralized, becoming basic expectations that no longer provide completive advantage but eventually become minimum thresholds to be met by anyone with ambitions of competing for long-term customer loyalty.\\" (page 219)<br /><br />I realize that these three brief excerpts are taken out of context. However, hopefully, they will help those who read this brief commentary to obtain at least a sense of what Carbone offers in this book. His customer experience management program is cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective. That said, I think it would be a fool's errand to try to implement all of it, either immediately or over an extended period of time. \\"Getting clued in [to what is of greatest importance to your customers] is the critical first step. From that start, you too will begin to harness the kind of relentless energy that is generated by sensing clues and recognizing their meaning and importance in the eyes [and hearts] of your customers.\\"<br /><br />In the Afterword, Carbone confides that he now spends much less time tryingto convince people to accurately measure the experiential value they create for their customers and much more time explaining how to do it. How accurate and current are your organization's measurements? Unless they are both, your organization cannot possibly manage customer experience, much less increase its value.their customers and much more time explaining how to do it. How accurate and current are your organization's measurements? Unless they are both, your organization cannot possibly manage customer experience, much less increase its value.	2005-07-23

They introduce and then rigorously examine what they call \\"five battle-tested plays for capturing and keeping the lead in any market.\\" Use of \\"any\\" is an exaggeration because, of course, it is imperative to market whatever one offers only where  potential is greatest for sufficiently profitable sales. Zagula and Tong duly note that \\"no matter what the play, if you're running it on the wrong field or with the wrong resources, it just won't work.\\" In marketing as in thoroughbred racing, \\"there are courses for horses.\\" Also, different situations require different \\"plays.\\" Here are the five which Zagula and Tong offer for consideration:<br /><br />The Drag Race: \\"In some circumstances, your best bet calls for singling out one competitor and putting the pedal to the metal racing against them to win.\\"<br /><br />Comment: Endorsed by Henry V, the Russian forces at Balaclava, and Crazy Horse and his Oglala Sioux warriors...but not by the French forces at Agincourt, Lord Cardigan and the Light Brigade, and the Seventh Cavalry under Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer's command at the Little Big Horn.<br /><br />The Platform Play: Once dominant, develop strategic alliances and strengthen position because \\"you never know from where a new challenger is likely to emerge.\\"<br /><br />Comment: Obviously, the strategy and tactics are almost wholly defensive. This allows time to consolidate, train, refresh, obtain and evaluate competitive intelligence, and in all other appropriate ways anticipate threats to dominance.<br /><br />The Stealth Play: As you gather resources and complete preparations, whittle away at the incumbent's weak points. However, never forget that \\"big, dumb, slow companies can still squish you.\\"<br /><br />Comment: An excellent strategy for organizations with severely limited resources. Margins for error are razor-thin. The \\"big, dumb, slow companies\\"  can afford to carpet bomb. Be a sniper. Carefully read Sun Tzu's The Art of War, especially the chapter on Estimates. Also Jason Jennings' Think Big, Act Small.<br /><br />The The Best-of-Both Play: Rather than focus on compromises (\\"trade-offs\\") at both the high and low ends of the given market, gain dominance over the entire category \\"by collapsing these two ends. If you appeal to the most important needs of each segment of the market, you can win them all.\\"<br /><br />Comment: Huge \\"if\\" because, when attempting to appeal to all market segments, you could lose in competition for dominance in any one of them.<br /><br />High-Low Play: Try to close out the competition by splitting the given category and thereby owning both. \\"This is the hardest play to manage, but if it's done right, you'll achieve high volumes and high margins at the same time.\\"<br /><br />Comment: An even greater \\"if.\\"<br /><br />Any summary such as this fails to establish for any one \\"play\\" the extensive context within which Zagula and Tong carefully explain the relative advantages and disadvantages of each. Hence the importance of the \\"Take-Aways\\" section which they provide at the end of the chapter which they devote to each of the five. Hence the importance, also, of Chapter 7 in which they discuss how to \\"shift gears\\" from one to another, Part II in which they help their reader to analyze the the \\"terrain\\" of her or his own competitive marketplace (i.e. mapping both perils and opportunities), and Part III in which they explain HOW to initiate and then sustain an appropriate play \\"as a killer campaign.\\"<br /><br />Of special interest and value to me is what Zagula and Tong have to say about \\"The Campaign Brief.\\" It is thoroughly explained in Chapter 13. Here is a brief excerpt:<br /><br />\\"First, your campaign brief will be a single document you'll follow for the campaign, so you'll need to cover pretty much everything.....You find the key points, the essence, of all the analysis, strategy, and guidance you've come up with so far -- and cram it all onto a single page.

Each offers authoritative answers to the most important questions concerning its specific subject. The material in this book is drawn from a variety of sources which include the Harvard Business School Press and the Harvard Business Review as well as Harvard ManageMentor®, an online service. I strongly recommend the official Harvard Business Essentials Web site ([...]) which offers free interactive versions of tools, checklists, and worksheets cited in this book and other books in the Essentials series. Each volume is indeed \\"a highly practical resource for readers with all levels of experience.\\" And each is by intent and in execution solution-oriented. Although I think those who have only recently embarked on a business career will derive the greatest benefit, the material is well-worth a periodic review by senior-level executives.<br /><br />Richard Luecke is the author of several other books in the Essentials series. Once again, credit him with pulling together a wealth of information and counsel from various sources. In this instance, he was assisted by a subject advisor, Michael Watkins, who is an associate professor at the Harvard Business School who does research on negotiation and leadership. Together, they have carefully organized the material as follows.<br /><br />First, they examine various types of negotiation (e.g. distributive and integrative) and then introduce four key concepts: BATNA (i.e. best alternative to a negotiated agreement), reservation price, ZOPA (i.e. zone of possible agreement), and value creation through trades. Next, they shift their attention to nine steps of preparation to consummate a deal; \\"table tactics\\" when engaged in negotiation; FAQs about price, process, and \\"people problems; barriers to agreement (e.g. negotiating with \\"die-hard bargainers\\"); mental errors (e.g. irrational expectations); the importance of establishing and then cultivating various relationships; negotiating for others (i.e. the functions of independent and non-independent agents); and finally, negotiation skills which build organizational competence (e.g. continuous improvement and using negotiation as an organizational opportunity). I especially appreciate the fact that, at the end of each of the ten chapters, a \\"Summing Up\\" section is provided which focuses on key points and, later, facilitates a review of the book's narrative. I am also grateful for \\"Useful Implementation Tools\\" in the Appendix.<br /><br />Years ago, the eminent psychologist Carl Rogers recommended three separate but related steps when one is involved in a negotiation of any kind. First, identify the issues on which both \\"sides\\" agree and set them aside. Next, agree to concessions, compromises, etc. on other issues and then set them aside.

After sharing his thoughts about research and its limits, various fallacies of marketing, and what he thinks \\"customer satisfaction\\" is (and isn't), and he reviews and then discusses in much greater depth the four keys to modern marketing (i.e. price, brand, packaging, and relationships) that were discussed (to varying degree) in his previously published books. Here are a few of the \\"nuggets\\" inserted within or provided at the conclusion of most chapters:<br /><br />Price:<br /><br />\\"Push price higher. Higher prices don't just talk; they tempt.\\"<br />\\"The bigger your price, the higher your perceived quality.\\"<br /><br />Brand:<br /><br />\\"Brands, then, are not simply tools for attracting business, which is the conventional view of them. A brand does not merely attract clients, it convinces clients that they got just what the brand promised - even when they didn't.\\"<br /><br />Packaging:<br /><br />\\"Look as great as you are.\\"<br />\\"Build prettier mousetraps.\\"<br />\\"Your package is your service.\\"<br /><br />Relationships:<br /><br />\\"To make and keep a sale, make and keep a powerful connection.\\"<br />\\"Create an oasis.\\"<br />\\"Avoid blind dates.\\"<br />\\"To build trust, build consistency - in everything you do.\\"<br /><br />Beckwith carefully creates a context for each of these and other insights, all of them based on his wide and deep range of real-world experiences. Think of him as a pragmatic idealist in that he is almost wholly preoccupied with understanding what works, what doesn't, and why (then sharing what he learns with as many people as possible) while retaining an abiding faith in the essential goodness of most people and in what can yet be accomplished to improve the quality of products and services as well as to strengthen relationships with others.<br /><br />With regard to the title of this book, it is appropriate for two reasons: First, Beckwith examines in much greater depth many of the concepts first introduced in Selling the Invisible; also, for those who are frequent guests of a Ritz-Carlton hotel, it calls to mind what the company's founder, C&eacute;sar Ritz, observed long ago: \\"People like to be served, but invisibly.\\" Beckwith is eager to help those who read this to possess \\"the invisible touch\\" and then apply it effectively in relationships with those whom they are privileged to serve.  Yes, he would insist, it really is a privilege to serve others. In my opinion, this is Harry Beckwith's most valuable book thus far. It remains for each reader to decide which of his insights and suggestions are most appropriate to her or his own circumstances.with others.

First, they explain why power is necessary in organizations \\"even though our society distrusts power and those who seek it.\\" Next, they examine the sources of power. Then they explain why power is realized only through some form of expression. In Chapter 4, they examine influence in sharper focus, illustrating three specific tactics which any manager can use. Then in the next two chapters, Luecke and Reardon shift their attention to the concept of persuasion. They identify the four elements of persuasion and discuss how various audiences and people with diverse decision-making styles are receptive (\\"susceptible\\") to different forms of persuasion. Then in Chapter 6, they explain how to appeal both to the mind (with logic and/or evidence) and the to heart (by anchoring the given proposition in a human context).

I know of no other single volume which can be of greater assistance to those decision-makers, whatever their current circumstances may be. That said, it would be foolish to depend entirely on a single source for guidance, albeit one as insightful and practical as this one is. Rigorous, sometimes painful soul-searching must first be completed. In a perfect world, everyone in a given organization cooperates, collaborates, and communicates effectively. In reality, that is true of very few organizations. For all others, a team can be created and then generously supported whose mission is to solve a given problem or exploit an opportunity but one which, in process, also demonstrates HOW to complete any other mission with effective cooperation, collaboration, and communication.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this volume are urged to check out all other volumes in Harvard Business Essentials Series as well as O'Toole's Leading Change, Evan I.

I soon realized, however, that Volkman wrote this book for \\"therapists and practitioners of all kinds [and] their clients\\" but also for others such as I who wish to use the tools which she provide, \\"either individually or in a group.\\"  In layman's terms, Applied Metapsychology unifies mental and physical experience. Its purpose is to discover \\"rules\\" that apply to both. As for Traumatic Incident Reduction (TIR), it involves a brief, one-on-one, non-hypnotic, person-centered, simple and highly structured method for permanently eliminating the negative effects of past traumas. TIR is thus part of the larger subject of Metapsychology.<br /><br />Volkman's primary objective in this volume is, as the subtitle suggests, to help improve the quality of her reader's life in all of its dimensions (mental, physical, emotional) by explaining various \\"Life Skills\\" which anyone can acquire and then strengthen. Volkman's ultimate objective is to help each reader to achieve maximum fulfillment of human potentialities, whatever the nature and extent of those potentialities may be. More specifically, she helps her reader to become \\"fully present\\" in all experiences, to increase knowledge and awareness of \\"how life works,\\" to bring about positive mental and emotional change and then to enable those personal changes to assist positive changes in \\"the outer environment,\\" and finally, to help each reader access more of her or his potentialities through a series of eminently practice exercises. Volkman hastens to add, however, \\"We all process information in our own ways. The exercises are suggestions only. I invite you to read and use this book in whatever way suits you best.\\"<br /><br />Many years ago, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes's observed \\"I wouldn't give a fig for the simplicity this side of complexity but I'd give my life for the simplicity on the far side of complexity.\\" To Volkman's great credit, she helps readers such as I to understand certain terms and techniques which would otherwise be difficult (if not impossible) to grasp, much less apply. Presumably she would agree with me that it would be a serious mistake to proceed from one exercise to the next, completing each without careful consideration. My suggestion is to read her book from beginning to end to gain a sense of what it offers, then re-read those portions which resonate with one's own specific needs, interests, fears, concerns, and (yes) hopes. Only afterward should some (but not necessarily all) exercises be completed and in whatever sequence seems most appropriate. Any process of self-discovery is necessarily a rigorous, difficult, and sometimes a frustrating and lonely journey. Volkman cannot accompany anyone during that journey but she can indeed help to guide and inform those who embark on it.my life for the simplicity on the far side of complexity.\\" To Volkman's great credit, she helps readers such as I to understand certain terms and techniques which would otherwise be difficult (if not impossible) to grasp, much less apply.

I mention this because Koteshwar uses narrative to examine a number of real-world situations with devices normally employed by fiction writers. In this volume, we have no mice searching for relocated cheese or squirrels quarreling over strategy and positioning. Rather, Koteshwar shares with his reader various lessons which can be learned from successful and (especially) from unsuccessful investments in the stock market. Others are better qualified than I to comment on Koteshwar's expertise. I shall limit my attention to what I found of greatest value.<br /><br />First, Koteshwar makes a convincing case for having patience, either when trading stocks or when tracking those another has purchased for you. Also, he leaves little doubt that trading requires far more attention (e.g. research) than many investors are willing and/or able to commit. For that reason, the selection of a broker seems at least as important as the selection of a given stock in which to invest. However, Kateshwar helps investors such as I to understand the rules of what really is an immensely complicated \\"game.\\" Scores are kept. There are winners and losers. Timing and luck are often key factors. That said, it is highly desirable to understand the \\"rules\\" of stock trading, either when selecting investments or collaborating which an intermediary. Also, Kateshwar disabused me of my tendency to think of \\"Wall Street\\" as a location where financial \\"wizards\\" resemble medieval alchemists who convert \\"base metals into gold.\\" Finally, Kateshwar helped me to understand that there is no \\"perfect\\" stock. However, if selected with meticulous care, there is for almost any investor a stock (or stocks) most appropriate to that investor's specific circumstances, resources, timetable, and ultimate objective(s).<br /><br />Invoking athletic metaphors, I presume to suggest that some investors are sprinters, others are milers, and still others are marathoners. The shorter the course, the greater the rewards...and yes, the risks. To me, the compelling value of Kateshwar's book is derived from his behind-the-scenes insights into the investment process.

My personal story is to learn, share everything I have learned, and earn the right to learn more. You will find here [in The Story Factor] everything I know about using story to influence others.\\"<br /><br />How many books on the subject of leadership does Amazon now offer? I just checked. The current total is 16,159. Who were history's greatest leaders? (My own list includes Alexander, Jesus, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Mohandas Gandhi.) What do all of them share in common? Each was a great storyteller. Each used one or more of the six types of stories which Simmons brilliantly explains in her book:<br /><br />Who I Am<br />Why I Am Here<br />The Vision<br />Teaching<br />Values-in-Action<br />I Know What You Are Thinking<br /><br />To these six I presume to add I Know What You Care About. Point is, great leaders have a clear identity as well as a clear purpose and a compelling vision, use relevant information effectively to educate others and use a narrative effectively to anchor a necessary course of action within a human context because they thoroughly understand the given audience. As Simmons correctly asserts, persuasion must begin with trust and immediately fails without it. Hence the importance of credibility. Persuasion then requires that the \\"message\\" resonate with what is of greatest importance to the given audience. Hence the imperative need for relevance as when Roosevelt (during his \\"fireside chats\\") and Churchill (during his speeches in Parliament) told their listeners what they must understand, not necessarily what they wanted to hear.<br /><br />Throughout her brilliant book, Simmons rigorously examines the basic components of effective storytelling. She explains what a story is and what it can do that facts alone cannot. She suggests how to tell \\"a good story,\\" in process explaining the psychology of an effective story's influence. She offers excellent advice on how to influence the unwilling, the unconcerned, and the unmotivated. Simmons also devotes an entire chapter to \\"Storylistening as a Tool of Influence,\\" then in the next chapter identifies a number of storyteller Dos and Don'ts. She concludes her book with insights which have their greatest value only if considered within the context created by the previous chapters.<br /><br />For whom will this book be of greatest value? Certainly to those who must regularly communicate with others and currently lack the skills to do so effectively. Also to those who are required to make a major presentation of some kind such as when attempting to persuade a supervisor to approve a significant course of action or persuading a customer to make a major purchase. In fact, there are countless other situations in which the skills which Simmons explains and the tools which she provides can also give those who master them a decisive advantage.<br /><br />Keep in mind, however, that \\"story\\" is but one of several factors in communication. Long ago, John Wiley Hill (founder of Hill & Knowlton) defined public relations worthy of the name as \\"truth well-told.\\" Simmons leaves absolutely no doubt whatsoever about the importance of a truthful \\"message\\" communicated by a trusted \\"messenger.\\" Credibility is absolutely essential and can only be earned by a combination of trust and expertise. What I also appreciate about Simmons' approach throughout this book is the conversational tone she establishes and then sustains. There is a refreshing absence of preaching. She is convinced (and I totally agree) that each person has her or his own \\"story\\" to tell. It remains for each person to select the most appropriate style was well as the most effective tools to tell that story well. Who are you? Why are you here? What do you REALLY care about? It remains for each reader to answerquestions such as these and, obviously, the answers will vary significantly. Whatever the answers may be at any given time, Simmons urges that they be celebrated...and cherished.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check others such as Doug Lipman's Improving Your Storytelling (he wrote the Foreword to The Story Factor), Stephen Denning's The Leader's Guide to Storytelling, and Storytelling in Organizations co-authored by John Seely Brown, Denning, Katarina Groh, and Laurence Prusak.nificantly.

Boyden of Deerfield	Books	5	15	17	N	Y	A Special Person...a Special Place	I read this book when it was first published in 1966. Not long afterward, I had the privilege as well as pleasure of visiting Deerfield Academy and was given a tour of it by its headmaster, Frank Boyden. At that time, I was a Master of English at Kent School (Kent, CT). I recently re-read this book and another of John McPhee's, A Sense of Where You Are. The title of the latter work correctly describes Boyden's total understanding of his relationship with a once tiny school (founded in 1797) located in what remains a rustic village. Throughout his years as headmaster (1902-1968), he knew exactly where he was as well as where exactly he wanted Deerfield to be (and remain) under his leadership. Just as Mr. Boyden gave me a tour of Deerfield Academy during my visit so many years ago, McPhee enables his reader to take a comprehensive \\"tour\\" of the unique and compelling relationship between a remarkable educator and the school community he headed for 66 years.<br /><br />Of special interest to me is what McPhee reveals about Boyden's style of leadership (autocratic but compassionate) and his obsession with maintaining \\"proper\\" appearances (e.g. manicured grounds, only the very best athletic equipment, the most impressive-looking athletes first off the bus). With regard to his relationships with faculty members, \\"The more you cooperate with the headmaster, the more he imposes on you,\\" according to a teacher who had been at Deerfield for 25 years. \\"He expects a fantastic commitment. If you give it, he expects more. If you don't give it, he carries you, but you don't exist.\\"<br /><br />As a father of four and a grandfather of seven, I also found many valuable lessons to be learned from Boyden's relationships with Deerfield's students. For example, his emphasis on courtesy in athletics. \\"No matter how able a Deerfield player was or how close a game had become, if he showed anger he was benched.\\" For Boyden, athletic competition must demonstrate \\"a moral force.\\" He played on Deerfield teams until he was about 35, and was head coach of football, basketball, and baseball until he was nearly 80. He loved sports. He often observed that \\"it's better to lose in a sportsmanlike way than to win and gloat over it.\\" Point made, he would then add, \\"Now, boys, let's not let up on [the given opponent] for a minute. Let's win this one, if possible, by forty points.\\" Frank Boyden had a sense of where he was as well as of where everyone else associated with Deerfield Academy should always be. The values to which he dedicated his life often require personal sacrifices which -- apparently -- many parents, educators, and young people today are unwilling and/or unable to make.until he was about 35, and was head coach of football, basketball, and baseball until he was nearly 80.

In it, he develops many of the same concepts introduced in the earlier work as he focuses on a common situation in which someone concludes a formal presentation and then, during  the Q&A session which follows, encounters \\"tough questions.\\" Some of  these questions may challenge the presenter's competence, perhaps even her or his integrity. Presidential press conferences offer the most familiar examples of such situations, as do the so-called \\"presidential debates\\" during which candidates are challenged to respond to \\"tough questions\\" by their opponents as well as by journalists. How to prepare for such questions? And then, how to respond to them effectively? These are the two separate but related questions to which Weissman responds.<br /><br />We expect political opponents to be confrontational. By now, we also expect journalists to probe and prod, perhaps even attack political candidates obtain from them whatever is needed to produce a \\"story\\" for electronic or print distribution. However, most of us never run for political office, nor are we interrogated by journalists. Nonetheless, we are frequently in a situation when we present information to a supervisor, to associates, or to a customer (or prospective customer) and are then challenged to defend our observations, recommendations, etc. The more important the given situation, the more rigorous the scrutiny of whatever we assert and/or propose. Hence the great value of In the Line of Fire.<br /><br />What Weissman offers is a cohesive and comprehensive preparation to anyone who must respond effectively to \\"tough questions.\\" In the Introduction, he makes several points so important that I include them now: \\"Very few people on the face of this planet have the expertise, the charm, the quickness of wit, or the legal circumstances to respond [as deftly as a Bill Clinton does] to challenging questions....The purpose of this book and its many real-life examples is to provide you with the skills to handle such questions, and [in italics] only [end italics] such questions. If all the questions you are ever faced with are of the `Where do I sign?' variety, you could spend your time with a good mystery novel instead. Forewarned is forearmed. One other forewarning: All the techniques you are about to learn require [should be in italics] absolute truth.\\" The word \\"handle\\"\\" means how to deal with tough questions. \\"While providing an answer is an integral part of `handling,' every answer you give to every question you get must be honest and straightforward. If not, all the other techniques [offered in this book] will be for naught. With a truthful answer as your foundation, all those techniques will enable you to survive, if not prevail, in the line of fire.\\"<br /><br />Unlike so many other business book authors, Weissman devotes much less of his attention to core principles than he does to the effective application of those principles.  Throughout In the Line of Fire, he cites and discusses a number of \\"real-life examples\\" which include those featuring Bill Clinton, David and Goliath, Bruce Lee, Mike Wallace, an episode from The Bob Newhart Show, the NAFTA debate, the 1992, 2000, and 2004 Presidential Debates, Colin Powell, John F. Kennedy versus Richard M. Nixon, and General Norman Schwarzkopt.<br /><br />Weissmman views the martial arts as the most pertinent modern equivalent of classical warfare, identifying six critical mental and physical skills which are as important during a press conference as they are on a battlefield: Concentration, Self-Defense, Balance, Agility, Discipline, and Self-Contol. According to Weissman, \\"This book will translate each of these martial arts skills into Q&A techniques and then demonstrate how you can apply them in your mission-critical encounters.\\" It is worth noting here that David did not wrestle Goliath. Previously, David's advanced skills had enabled him to slay a lion with his slingshot. Before facing Goliath, David took as much time as necessary to select the best stones. Weissman is well aware of the fact that in The Art of War, Sun Tzu asserted that every battle is won or lost before it is fought.<br /><br />To me, it is very important that Weissman stresses the importance of \\"absolute truth\\" whenever and to whomever one makes a presentation and then must respond to any questions that presentation may evoke. Many years ago, John W. Hill (founder of Hill & Knowlton) explained that public relations worthy of the name offers \\"truth well-told.\\" Today, there is widespread skepticism and (especially) cynicism within our society about almost any effort to persuade us about anything or anyone. In my opinion, no one is better qualified than is Weissman to suggest all manner of strategies and tactics with regard to HOW. That said, his wise counsel is worthless unless and until there is impeccable honesty and seamless integrity in the WHAT.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this volume are urged to check out Stephen Denning's The Leader's Guide to Storytelling: Mastering the Art and Discipline of Business Narrative and Squirrel Inc.: A Fable of Leadership through Storytelling as well as Gary Hankins' The Power of the Pitch: Transform Yourself into a Persuasive Presenter and Win More Business, and Storytelling in Organizations: Why Storytelling Is Transforming 21st Century Organizations and Management, co-authored by John Seely Brown, Stephen Denning, Katalina Groh, and Laurence Prusak.lion with his slingshot.

In this volume, Light suggests how certain organizations have met these requirements and how others can also do so. He concedes that a moribund or demoralized organization can \\"create a burst of high performance by terrifying [its] workforce or rallying [its] troops\\" but invariably the results are only temporary. He asserts (and I agree) that the greater challenge is to \\"build organizations that produce results by hedging against the inevitable surprises and vulnerabilities that lurk in today's environment, while exploiting opportunities to shape the future to their advantage.\\" Hence the importance of having a stereoscopic perspective which includes an awareness of possible and at least a sense of probable perils as well as opportunities. Hence the importance of having a design which can accommodate modification in response to \\"inevitable surprises.\\" Hence the importance, also, of having a foundation which can withstand the impact of adversity while sustaining competitive initiatives.<br /><br />In 1999, Light was engaged by the RAND Corporation to examine what its researchers had learned about managing public organizations during several previous decades . He eventually decided to focus on what had been learned about how any organization can achieve and then sustain high performance. It is important to note, as does Light, that RAND research is guided by three basic principles embedded in its own organizational culture: \\"First, RAND has a well-deserved reputation for questioning the questions.....Second, RAND has a long history of questioning its own answers through peer review and quality control....Third, RAND allows the evidence to speak, even when it unsettles the client.\\" I was also interested to learn that RAND had some serious problems of its own during the mid-1990s which are noted within Light's narrative. RAND solved those problems by focusing on the basics of the Four Pillars.<br /><br />That said, let's examine how he organizes his material. In Chapter 1, he shares several lessons about the future revealed by RAND's research after a rigorous analysis of \\"four critical sources of organizational vulnerability: ignorance, inflexibility, indifference, and inconsistency.\\" In Chapter 2, Light shifts his attention to what RAND research has learned about addressing the vulnerabilities of uncertainty. Of special interest to me are the \\"seven powerful predictors of high performance\\" and the \\"four underlying pillars that help organizations achieve extraordinary results,\\" all of which had been identified by the research. Then in Chapter 3, Light explains what RAND has learned about each of the \\"four pillars.\\" In Chapter 4, he focuses on what RAND has learned about operating a \\"robust\\" organization. \\"Simply asked, how do robust organizations create the alertness, agility, adaptability, and alignment [which are] essential to high performance?\\" This chapter provides four answers. Then in the fifth and final chapter, he shares what RAND has learned about managing change. In this chapter, the reader is provided with \\"six suggested steps for improving the odds of success.\\"<br /><br />At this point in my brief commentary, I feel obliged to explain that Light has accomplished far more than examine an immense body of research data and then merely summarize key points. He had more ambitious objectives for this book and he achieved all of them. They include focusing much less attention on broad general principles (albeit sound ones) and far more attention on HOW almost any organization (regardless of size or nature) can apply those principles where perils are greatest, where opportunities are most promising, and where significant change is most likely. Granted, senior-level executives will find few head-snapping revelations in this book. Light creates for them, however, broad and deep access to a wealth of valuable (previously inaccessible) information from which he helps them to learn how to establish or nourish their own \\"robust\\" organization. After a careful reading and then re-reading of his book, they should then review key points in the Conclusion at the end of each chapter. I  strongly recommend that his readers regularly review, also, the dozens of (boxed)  idea clusters which Light thoughtfully provides throughout the narrative. For example, The Six Revolutions (Page 27), The First, Second, and Third Rounds of Winnowing: Strong Associations with Performance (Pages 56-57, 60, 62, respectively), and Organizing for Lightning (Page 150).<br /><br />One final point. As James Q. Wilson notes in the Foreword, Light's work at RAND \\"did not involve any pre-conditions or post-research clearances. What you will read here is Light's best independent advice.\\" In my opinion, The Four Pillars of High Performance is a brilliant achievement.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this volume are urged to check out Evan I. Schwartz's Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors, Marco Iansiti and Roy Levien's The Keystone Advantage: What the New Dynamics of Business Ecosystems Mean for Strategy, Innovation, and Sustainability, Peter Schwartz's The Art of the Long View: Planning for the Future in an Uncertain World and Inevitable Surprises: Thinking Ahead in a Time of Turbulence, and Jason Jennings' Think Big, Act Small: How America's Best Performing Companies Keep the Start-up Spirit Alive as well as Seeing What's Next: Using Theories of Innovation to Predict Industry Change co-authored by Clayton M.

In this volume, Asacker creates a hypothetical situation in which he engages in a sustained dialogue with an Executive about a major business topic, branding. Presumably, the Executive represents countless \\"real\\" people with whom Asacker has had discussions over the years. This is a rhetorical device, not a gimmick, and it works remarkably well. In this volume, he really does focus his \\"clear eye\\" (and uncluttered mind) on what he considers to be significant but durable misconceptions about branding.<br /><br />In response to observations and questions posed by the Executive, Asacker makes a number of specific assertions with which some readers may disagree. Here is a representative selection.<br /><br />Branding is today's most powerful business concept because \\"it will force you to understand the behaviors, desires, and expectations of your audience. You'll perceive your business -- and its place in the world -- in a whole new way. And you'll be driven to do something to both improve it and to improve people's lives.\\"<br /><br />\\"A strong brand evokes one or more of the following behavioral attributes: you'll pay a premium for it when compared to alternative solutions; you'll go out of your way to get it; or you'll continuously repurchase it. You won't accept a substitute, within reason, of course.\\"<br /><br />\\"It doesn't matter what people think about you or your brand. What matters is how you make them feel about themselves and their decisions in your brand's presence.\\"<br /><br />\\"Focus on what's being internalized by the decisionmaker. The social and psychological factors. Because marketing is not about helping salespeople sell, and it's not about helping customers to buy. It's about helping customers feel and achieve. It's about supporting and guiding. Spend your time helping your customers make meaningful connections around their passions.\\"<br /><br />\\"There's an old Zen maxim, `You can't control the waves, but you can learn to surf!' We're living in a new world now -- one that revolves around the rapidly changing expectations of the customer. There's no stability. None. You must move with people, like a life preserver in a shifting sea. You must catch their wave. Get out there and interact with your audience. Find new and compelling ways to become meaningful to them. Try something new and see if it takes hold. You can't build a great brand by avoiding risks.\\"<br /><br />Obviously, these brief quotations are taken out of context. However, they indicate some of the reasons why Asacker is convinced that branding is \\"the most powerful business concept,\\" not merely an important marketing concept. He argues persuasively that branding requires effective execution of both marketing and innovation which, in The Practice of Management, Peter Drucker suggests are the two basic functions of any organization. Asacker concludes with the observation that \\"brand-rearing\\" resembles raising a child. Citing the African proverb that it takes a village to raise a child, Asacker sees (with a clear eye) the brand's \\"village\\" as being \\"a complex web of relationships among\\" an organization's people, customers, and other stakeholders. For brands to thrive in today's business world, they must be guided and nourished, to be sure, but also allowed to find their own way. Some brands will. Many won't.<br /><br />Perhaps you will not agree with all of Asacker's ideas (I don't) but I think you will agree that each has been carefully developed and then clearly presented. If he has helped you to clarify your own thoughts about branding, then he will have achieved his primary objective.out helping customers to buy. It's about helping customers feel and achieve.

(Purple, of Course)	Obviously, the purpose of this title is to attract attention. And it does. When you begin to read this book, ignore the title (at least for a while) and focus on Godin's narrative. The appropriateness of Godin's title is best revealed during a careful reading of his lively narrative. As always, his ideas and writing style have Snap! Crackle! and Pop! Think of Godin as a cereal thinker.<br /><br />In this volume, Godin offers his own profile of a great story: It is true, not because it is factual but because it is consistent and authentic; it offers a promise (e.g. enlightenment, entertainment, inspiration); it can be trusted because it is (to repeat) consistent and authentic; it is subtle; its impact \\"happens fast\\"; it appeals (preferably) to all of our senses (seldom, if ever to our logic); it is crafted for a specific audience; it does not contradict itself; and finally, it is in alignment with what its audience already knows, feels, believes, etc. Re the last point, a great story offers a reminder and a reassurance while, paradoxically, challenging conventional wisdom. Above all, it commands attention. Godin's profile of a great story also describes the most effective marketing campaigns.<br /><br />Here's a question: What do Aesop, Jesus Christ, the Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, Abraham Lincoln, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), Joel Chandler Harris, and L. Frank Baum have in common? Answer: All were great storytellers who, obviously, can come in all shapes and sizes. One of Godin's most important points is that almost anyone can be a great storyteller IF they (a) have a convincing, indeed compelling story to tell and (b) they tell it to the right audience.<br /><br />Albeit taken out of context, here are a few brief quotations which are representative of Godin's thinking:<br /><br />\\"Every consumer has a worldview that affects the product you want to sell. That worldview alters the way they interpret everything you say and do. Frame your story in terms of the worldview, and it will be heard.\\" (excerpted from page 60)<br /><br />\\"People only notice stuff that's new and different. And the moment they notice something new, they start making guesses about what to expect next.\\" (excerpted from page 68)<br /><br />\\"Humans are able to make extremely sophisticated judgments in a fraction of a second. And once they've drawn that conclusion, they resist changing it.\\" (excerpted from page 76)<br /><br />\\"Stories let us lie to ourselves. And those lies satisfy our desires. It's the story, not the good or the service you actually sell, that pleases the customer.\\" (excerpted from page 84)<br /><br />\\"The only stories that work, the only stories with impact, the only stories that spread are the `I can't believe that!' stories. These are the stories that aren't just repeated: these are the stories that demand to be repeated.\\" (excerpted from page 132)<br /><br />For whom will this book be of greatest value? Good question. My own response is that those who are receptive to rigorous and coherent thinking which is unorthodox will be appreciative of it but only those who are both willing and able to MAKE HIS IDEAS WORK FOR THEM will derive any value from it. First, they must carefully consider the series of nine questions which Godin poses in the final section, \\"So, What to Do?\\" Next, they must re-read the book at least once and then formulate their own answers to those nine questions. Throughout that difficult but rewarding process, Godin suggests, they must \\"understand that the people with a worldview that gives them a bias to listen to you are the most valuable customers on earth. Get permission from them to follow up, then get to work finding new [or much improved] products for the people who want them.\\"<br /><br />Those who have not already done so are strongly urged to read Godin's earlier works, notably Permission Marketing, Unleash the Ideavirus, Survival Is Not Enough, Purple Cow, and Free Prize Inside!your story in terms of the worldview, and it will be heard.\\" (excerpted from page 60)  <br /> <br />\\"People only notice stuff that's new and different.

(They later co-authored a book of that title based on the same course in which Collins had enrolled.) Myers quietly informed Collins and his classmates, \\"You are about to embark on a ten-week journey to discover your deepest inner essence.\\" Immediately Collins began to search for a replacement in the catalogue. Later, at his wife Joanne's urging, Collins remained in the class and accepted \\"a fundamental challenge issued to all of us: [begin italics] Make your life itself a creative work of art. [end italics]\\" More than two decades later, Ray offers in this volume a core process based on the meta-concept of \\"live-with heuristics\\" whose objective is to help a person achieve her or his \\"highest goal.\\"<br /><br />Time out. Those who have read this commentary to this point may be tempted to move on, just as Collins once was. Please don't. Hang in there just as Collins once did.<br /><br />As Collins explains, there are certain \\"mantras of living\\" that one implements for a period of time (usually a week or more) and then reflects upon what has been experienced as a result. For example:<br /><br />If at First You Don't Succeed, Surrender<br />Pay Attention!<br />Ask Dumb Questions<br />Destroy Judgment, Create Curiosity<br />Don't Think About It<br />Be Ordinary<br />Do Only What Is Easy, Effortless, and Enjoyable<br /><br />At Ray's urging, I came up with a few of my own:<br /><br />Don't Resist...Absorb<br />When Encountering Abstract Art, Don't Look at It...Listen<br />Remember What Really Bothered Me Last Week [Note: I never can]<br />Each New Day Is a Mulligan [Note: I am an avid golfer]<br />When Hearing Music, Don't Listen...See It<br /><br />As Ray explains, he realized over time that the impact of his course, Personal Creativity in Business, went beyond its structure, procedures, and exercises. \\"It touched something very deep in people. They made discoveries about themselves that informed their actions and transformed their lives. Even though we never mention it in our teaching, they discovered their highest goal -- the secret that would sustain them, come what may. As one participant put it years after taking the course, `This is transformation that works and lasts.'...[Students] learned -- most early in life but many much later -- through a crisis or through experiencing love and a connection to something higher that if they live for this connection, they keep growing closer to what is right for them. They are open to life and view it as an adventure.\\" Only by tapping their inner resources can they make their lives a creative work of art, fulfilling themselves in service to others.<br /><br />On several occasions as I read Ray's book, I was reminded of this passage from Lao-tzu's Tao Te Ching:<br /><br />Learn from the people<br />Plan with the people<br />Begin with what they have<br />Build on what they know<br />Of the best leaders<br />When the task is accomplished<br />The people will remark<br />We have done it ourselves.<br /><br />For me, this passage is directly relevant to the core process of \\"live-with heuristics\\" which can guide and inform those who aspire to lead others.<br /><br />Each life is a journey from one moment to the next, from one experience to the next. What we learn is revealed within a sequence of discoveries. (The word \\"heuristics\\" is derived from the Greek infinitive \\"heuriskein,\\" to find.) If reading this book is viewed as a journey, there is indeed much of value to discover from what it shares. With all due respect to Ray and his book, however, the discoveries of greatest value to me were re-discoveries of what I already knew (or thought I did).  In Appendix A, Continue the Journey, Ray acknowledges that there will be obstacles to overcome, albeit ones \\"that can be enriching.\\" He suggests several ways by which to face those obstacles and convert them into learning experiences. Of special relevance to me is this passage: \\"Many of us pack too much when we travel, and one thing you don't want to take with you on your journey to the highest goal is the VOJ, the Voice of Judgment. So write or draw the aspects of the VOJ or secret fears that you really don't want to take with you. Make them intense, because these are the remaining aspects of the VOJ that continue to trouble you.\\" They do indeed.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out the aforementioned Tao Te Ching as well as James O'Toole's Creating the Good Life: Applying Aristotle's Wisdom to Find Meaning and Happiness, Alan Watts's The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are, and David Whyte's The Heart Aroused: Poetry and the Preservation of the Soul in Corporate America.too much when we travel, and one thing you don't want to take with you on your journey to the highest goal is the VOJ, the Voice of Judgment.

I especially appreciate the \\"virtual timeline\\" she includes in Chapter 3 (pages 48-49) which lists several generations and indicates the key influences on each:<br /><br />The Silent Generation (born 1922-1945): The Great Depression and the New Deal; World War II; the Holocaust; Hiroshima; radio and films.<br /><br />The Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964): Vietnam War; assassinations of JFK, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy; placing a man on the Moon; Watergate; impact of the Cold War (e.g. bomb shelters); television; women's liberation; sexual revolution; environmental concerns (e.g. Green Party, Exxon Valdez).<br /><br />Generation X (born 1965-1076): Demolition of the Berlin Wall; Challenger disaster; Clinton  sex scandals; skyrocketing growth of the stock market and an abundant economy in the 1980s and 1990s; 24-hour, live news coverage; the dot-com economy; high-tech start-ups.<br /><br />Baby Boom Echo (born 1977-2000): Oklahoma City bombing; Columbine High School massacre; Y2K; Internet, WWW, and e-business; September 11, 2001, terrorists attacks; corporate scandals (e.g. Enron); video games; instant messaging.<br /><br />Then, in Part II, Hankin examines the impact of the five major emerging workforce trends on human resources. Specifically, the impact on HR policies and procedures, recruiting, compensation and benefits, and learning and training.

208947:US	51147790	R19K6AUAVCTPBY	0471659509	42257358	The Dollarization Discipline: How Smart Companies Create Customer Value...and Profit from It	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Dollarization Is (Common) Sense	As Fox and Gregory clearly demonstrate, it really does take rigorous discipline to \\"dollarize\\" one's impact on a business relationship, both directly with a customer and indirectly with that customer's own customers. They have devised a concept, Dollarization, which they define as \\"the translation of the benefits a product or service delivers to a customer into the dollars-and-cents financial impact to that customer.\\" They assert that the primary objective of a company should be to create value for its owners, and, that the best way to achieve that objective is to create maximum value for each customer. In other words, marketers and sellers tend to talk \\"value\\" but few actually understand and then sell their true financial value. Most marketers allow customers to make price the most important factor in a purchase decision. On the contrary, price should be considered as just ONE of the many costs involved in buying a product. For example, the purchase price of a car is obviously one factor to consider. However, fuel economy, maintenance costs, resale value, insurance, etc. should also be taken into full account while making the purchase decision. Those who master the Dollarization Discipline are prepared to explain all this to each prospective buyer.<br /><br />In Section 1, Fox and Gregory introduce the Dollarization concept (e.g., Why Dollarize?); in Section 2, they identify and explain correlations between Dollarization and selling (e.g. How to shorten the sales cycle?); in Section 3, they do the same for Dollarization and marketing (e.g. How to price new products?); and then in Section 4, they recommend a number of strategies and tactics by which to apply various Dollarization techniques (e.g. constructing the Customer Value File). Once having read these separate but interconnected Sections, the reader is then introduced to \\"The Dollarization Doctrine: Ten Rules to Successful Dollarization.\\" I presume to recommend that this Appendix (pages 249-251) be read before Section 1 and then re-read before reading each of the following three Sections. Presumably careful readers will highlight or underline key passages for purposes of review later. So I also presume to recommend that each review begin with a re-reading of the Appendix. The Rules which Fox and Gregory offer can -- and should -- guide and inform application of the Dollarization Discipline to any competitive marketplace.<br /><br />Throughout the narrative, Fox and Gregory include specific advice.  For example, when beginning to determine the value created for a single customer or for an entire population of customers, follow these five steps: Identify your direct competition, articulate what differentiates you from the competition, identify all the ways your differentiating features benefit your customer, determine how to quantify those benefits, and then determine how the quantified benefits result in dollars-and-cents savings for the customer. (See Table 20.1 on page 207).<br /><br />Here is another example of how the Dollarization Discipline can be beneficial. During a recent conversation with one of his most important customers, the CEO of one of my client companies learned that relatively minor adjustments of the delivery schedule would enable that customer to process much more quickly his own customers' orders. (The details are unimportant.) Certain adjustments reduced the sales cycle while accelerating receivables but they also strengthened relationships between the OEM (my client), its customer, and its customer's own customers. One of the most significant and yet least appreciated realities of business is the dollar-and-cents value of time. It is important to quantify the value of reducing a vehicle's fuel consumption, for example. It is also important to quantify the reduction of first-pass yield and cycle time within the process by which that vehicle is produced. Really, applications of the Dollarization Discipline are limited only by one's ability to recognize them.<br /><br />Warren Buffett once said something to the effect, \\"Price is what you charge but value is what others think it's worth.\\" Fox and Gregory agree. The single greatest benefit of their Dollarization Discipline is that it allows both seller and buyer to calculate accurately and (yes) verifiably the total value of a given product or service. Granted, making that determination may require substantial time and effort. So what? Use the Dollarization Discipline to calculate the ROI. You may well be very surprised by what you learn...and perhaps regret that you haven't used the Dollarization Discipline until now. Cheer up! Many (most?) of your competitors will never read this book. Just make certain that all of your associates do.ett once said something to the effect, \\"Price is what you charge but value is what others think it's worth.\\" Fox and Gregory agree.

In this volume, he develops his core concepts in much greater depth, acknowledging his high regard for Peter Senge's vision of the Total Learning Organization as delineated in his pioneer volume, The Fifth Discipline. Briefly, in it Senge suggests that there are five separate but interrelated \\"disciplines\\": building a Shared Vision which enables an organization to build a common commitment to the same long-term goals; formulating Mental Models which guide, inform, and sustain creativity and innovation; encouraging and supporting Team Learning; Personal Mastery of certain skills which enable an individual to learn and understand more and thus perform at a higher level of competence; and finally, Systems Thinking which establishes a holistic view, both of one's organization and of the marketplace in which it pursues success.<br /><br />In his Introduction to this book, Denning asserts that \\"the best way to communicate with people you are trying to lead is very often through a story. The impulse here is practical and pedagogical. [The Leader's Guide to Storytelling] shows how to use storytelling to deal with the most difficult challenges faced by leadership today.\\" Denning wholly agrees with Senge that a learning organization is an environment \\"where new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, where collective aspiration is set free, and where people are continually learning how to learn together.\\"  However, while agreeing on the importance of \\"systems thinking\\" as a way of looking at systems as a whole that will enable people to see complex chains of causation and so solve complex problems, Denning has three concerns which he shares on page 253. By the time his reader arrives at that point in the narrative, she or he may well share the same concerns.<br /><br />My purpose in this brief commentary is to focus on what I consider to be Denning's key points as he explains why and how storytelling is often the best way for leaders to communicate with those whom they are trying to lead. What he offers is a cohesive and comprehensive system. These are the core principles, as discussed thoroughly in Chapters 3-10:<br /><br />1. Select and then tell the story which is most appropriate for the given leadership challenge.<br /><br />2. Tell that story with style, truth, thorough preparation, and effective delivery.<br /><br />3. Select a narrative pattern based on the primary objective: to motivate others to action, to build trust in you, to build trust in your organization, to transmit your values, to get others working together, to share knowledge, to \\"tame the grapevine,\\" or to create and share your vision.<br /><br />Each reader will appreciate Table 1.1. (on page 18) which summarizes key points for each of the eight different narrative patterns discussed separately in Chapters, 3-10. (Additional Tables are provided later in the narrative whenever appropriate.) At the end of each chapter in Part Two, Denning thoughtfully includes a \\"Template\\" which poses a set of questions to be addressed when, for example, crafting a \\"springboard story.\\" Here's the first of ten questions: \\"What is the specific change in the organization or community or group that you hope to spark with the story?\\" Then in Part Three (Chapters 11 and 12), Denning explains how to put it all together by using narrative effectively, both to transform an organization and to become an interactive leader.<br /><br />Of special interest to me Denning's discussion (in the final chapter) of what he calls \\"Interactive, Tolstoyean\\" leadership and its relation to other theories in terms of leadership as a trait, as a skill, as a style, as situational, as motivation, and as transformation. This discussion serves as an appropriate conclusion to his book, one in which Denning has spelled out \\"specific, identifiable, measurable, trainable behaviors that can be used to achieve the goals of transformational leadership.\\"<br /><br />Storytelling really is a performance art. Some master the requisite skills. Most  don't. Denning offers no guarantees but does claim that those who consistently use the narrative tools he has provided will acquire new capabilities. Specifically, to communicate more effectively who they are and what they stand for, to be more attentive to the world as it is now, to speak the truth and do it well, to make their values explicit and take actions which are consistent with those values, to listen to the world and be receptive to innovation. Those who possess these new capabilities will attract the interest, then earn and sustain the trust and respect of those whom they may be privileged to lead.<br /><br />If this is the kind of leader you aspire to be, Denning's book awaits you...eager to be of substantial assistance.<br /><br />For whatever reasons, only in recent years has there been an awareness and appreciation of the importance of the business narrative. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Annette Simmons' The Story Factor, Doug Lipman's Improving Your Storytelling, and Storytelling in Organizations co-authored by John Seely Brown, Denning, Katarina Groh, and Laurence Prusak.the goals of transformational leadership.\\"     Storytelling really is a performance art.

211380:US	51147790	R3K6QQO5M5TADV	1578512077	785973180	Creativity Inc.: Building an Inventive Organization	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Cabbages, Kings, and Creativity	There are so many other books now in print which offer valuable guidance to those who wish to increase creative and innovative thinking within their own organizations. I identify several of them at the conclusion of this brief commentary. Include Mauzy and Harriman's among them. In fact, it is one of the most thoughtful and thought-provoking books on the separate but related subjects, creativity and innovation. Mauzy and Harriman agree with Teresa Amabile that creativity is the generation of novel and appropriate ideas whereas innovation implements those ideas \\"and thereby changes the order of things in the world.\\" They carefully organize their material as follows:<br /><br />Part I: Creative Thinking (The Dynamics That Underlie Creative Thinking, Becoming Creatively Fit as an Individual;l, and Breaking and Making Connections for an Enterprise)<br /><br />Part II: Climate (The Climate for Creativity in an Enterprise and Personal Creative Climate: The Bubble)<br /><br />Part III: Action (Leadership: Fostering Systemic Creativity, Purposeful Creativity, and Sustaining the Change)<br /><br />I agree with Mauzy and Harriman that, \\"When systemic creativity is in place, creativity flourishes from top to bottom and across all functions. People and teams come up with blockbuster ideas that turn into multimillion-dollar products or even billion-dollar new businesses. Or they create ingenious marketing campaigns that ratchet up revenue, or lead process improvement programs that delight customers and empower employees alike, or implement restructuring initiatives that maximize cost reductions but minimize layoffs. And systemic creativity does not apply just to the big creative triumphs: People in organizations daily spark thousands of ideas that provide value in themselves and also build a higher plateau from which greater peaks of creativity can rise.\\" I agree with Mauzy and Harriman that there is no \\"recipe\\" for systemic creativity but that most people within almost any organization (regardless of size or nature) can -- and will -- think more creatively if what Mauzy and Harriman characterize as \\"four critical dynamics\\" are present: motivation, curiosity and fear, the breaking and making of connections, and evaluation.<br /><br />True, there are individuals who -- almost single-handedly -- have generated novel and appropriate ideas or implemented someone else's ideas and thereby changed \\"the order of things in the world.\\" However, there are more instructive examples of how important, climate, environment, culture, etc. are to nourishing creative thought by members of teams or coalitions. Perhaps the most widely cited example is the world's first research and development center which Thomas Edison established in West Orange, New Jersey, in 1887.  Others exceptionally creative \\"communities\\" include the Disney studios which produced so many animation classics; Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) which developed the first personal computer; Apple Computer which then took it to market; the so-called \\"Skunk Works\\" where so many of Lockheed's greatest aircraft designs were formulated; and Los Alamos (NM) and the University of Chicago where the Manhattan Project eventually produced a new weapon called \\"The Gadget.\\"<br /><br />Everyone seems to agree that having creative and innovative people throughout all levels of any organization is highly desirable and substantially beneficial. To achieve \\"systemic creativity,\\" the question remains: HOW? The book which Mauzy and Harriman have written is their response to that question. I especially want to commend them on the fact that they devote much less attention to principles and much more attention to implementation than do most other books on this subject. With due respect to their talents as creators and innovators, I appreciate the fact that they are also pragmatists. No doubt each bears some scar tissue from combat with those who felt threatened by what is new or what is different.<br /><br/>When nearing the conclusion of their book, Mauzy and Harriman assert that information \\"is the fluid expression of knowledge feeding the creative effort. Keep it available, keep it rich and diverse, keep it flowing. And remember to keep it flowing up to leadership, not just horizontally or from the top down....If you and your organization have the resolve to carry on, the creative effort you undertake now will continue. In evolving forms, the effort will begin again and still continue. The rewards that creativity brings will continue and renew as well.\\" To paraphrase Henry Ford, whether you think you can or think you can't think creatively, you're right. Most limits really are self-imposed.<br /><br />For many of those who read Mauzy and Harriman's brilliant book, this will be the most exciting intellectual experience they have had in years.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for it are urged to check out Evan  Schwartz's Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors.

With all due respect to formal training programs, my own experience has convinced me that on-the-job training (especially cross-functional training) remains the most effective means by which to create and then sustain such an environment. Hence the importance of mentoring relationships which, Zachary correctly points out, \\"offer an opportunity for individuals to nurture seeds in others so they might become blossoms, and blossoms might become fruit, which then nourishes others.\\" Moreover, \\"When mentoring relationships are rooted in the fertile soil of a mentoring culture, they also enrich the quality of organizational life.\\"<br /><br />Zachary carefully organizes her material within two Parts. First, she explains what effective mentoring involves, how to embed it in a culture, how to integrate mentoring within that culture, and then how to implement mentoring initiatives. In Part 2, after identifying the hallmarks of effective mentoring, she focuses on key components: infrastructure, alignment, accountability, communication, value and visibility, demand, multiple mentoring opportunities, education and training, and \\"safety nets. \\" What we have in this single volume is a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system rather than a kaleidoscope of data, anecdotes, personal experiences, bromides, simplistic observations, and all manner of disjointed recommendations. That said, it would be a fool's errand to try to implement all of Zachary's system as is. As she would be the first to point out, all organizational cultures are different and many of them consist of several sub-cultures. Therefore, it remains for each reader to read and then re-read this book, complete the \\"Mentoring Culture Audit\\" (Appendix A), and (if possible) check out at least some of the resources recommended (Appendix B).<br /><br />Regrettably, formal education often fails to help students to \\"learn how to learn.\\" As a result, many people either do not realize what they don't know or, worse yet, think they fully understand what in fact they do not. My own experience suggests that, in general, people do not fear change; rather, they fear the unknown. That same experience also supports Derek Bok's observation that \\"If you think education is experience, try ignorance.\\" Effective mentoring, therefore, requires humility and patience as well as knowledge and competence. The best mentors sincerely care about serving the best interests of those with whom they are privileged to be associated. They are passionate life-long learners themselves. Their enthusiasm is often contagious.<br /><br />Obviously, I think very highly of this book. Zachary combines all of the skills of a cultural anthropologist with those of a clear thinker and eloquent writer. I also appreciate the CD-ROM which the publisher provides with it.

Frankly, I did not know quite what to expect as I began to read this book but it soon became obvious that Shapiro and Stevenson have much of value to say about the relevance of gambling to business organizations as well as to an individual's business career and personal life. They offer a concept which they call \\"Predictive Intelligence\\" (PI): \\"the ability to act in the face of uncertainty to bring about desired results.\\" It involves a process which begins with recognizing whether or not one is in a betting situation. If so, they recommend \\"The Gambler's Dozen,\\" steps by which to increase one's PI and thereby improve the odds when \\"placing\\" business bets, career bets, and life bets. If all this seems hokey, blame me. It really isn't. Shapiro and Stevenson are quite serious when asserting that \\"every purposive action is a bet; one acts now on the expectation or hope, but not the certainty, of the results that will be achieved in the future.\\" I agree. Given that premise, it is highly desirable to increase one's PI. Shapiro and Stevenson explain how.<br /><br />Each of the steps which comprise \\"The Gambler's Dozen\\" is carefully positioned within the OOPA! process (i.e. Orient, Organize, Predict, and Act!) and for each, the authors create a context with equal care. Step #6, for example, should be initiated only after having completed the previous five Steps. Perhaps the easiest way to grasp Shapiro and Stevenson's methodology is to think of it as a sequence ot questions to be answered:<br /><br />1. What future (i.e. desirable results) am I trying to create?<br /><br />2. Will playing this \\"game\\" be worth it for me?<br /><br />3. Do I need to make a radical shift now?<br /><br />4. Whose help will I need and how must I obtain it?<br /><br />5. How much \\"magic\\" will my current bets require?<br /><br />6. If my current plan fails (or is insufficient), what is my Plan B?<br /><br />7. What's the future space I'm betting into?<br /><br />8. What are my best \\"left side\\" bets?<br /><br />9. How much risk can I shed or shift?<br /><br />10. What's the \\"it\\" I'm betting into?<br /><br />11. Will I then be locked into a tighter set of follow-up bets?<br /><br />12. How will I know when to call it quits?<br /><br />Over a period of time, through repeated use, this checklist will become almost second nature to \\"players\\" on Wall Street and in Las Vegas as well as to those making complicated career decisions and to executives who must decide, for example, whether or not to introduce a new product or service.<br /><br />In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell suggests that many of the best decisions are made instinctively, without much (if any) \\"homework,\\" analysis, verification, etc. I agree. However, what Gladwell really doesn't consider in much depth is the fact that many \\"made in the blink of an eye\\" decisions reflect extensive prior experience in comparable situations. For example, many decisions in combat or in emergency rooms have life-or-death implications and must be made almost instantaneously. A master automotive mechanic may need only to listen to a running engine or to drive a vehicle a short distance before knowing almost immediately what a given problem is. Shapiro and Stevenson would add that gamblers seated at a Blackjack table or located around a Craps table in a casino have only a few seconds to place a bet. Those who understand and have followed \\"The Gambler's Dozen\\" have neither more nor less time than does anyone else but they ARE better informed to take smarter risks. Do they always win? Of course not.<br /><br />This is a thoughtful, eloquent, and entertaining book. Its recommendations are eminently practical. \\"The Gambler's Dozen\\" concept has almost unlimited applications.

That is too restrictive. In fact, what is offered in this volume can also be of great value to decision-makers in other organizations which are now or hope to become business partners with retail merchandisers.<br /><br />Moreover, I highly recommend this brilliant book to decision-makers in all other organizations (regardless of size or nature) which also need (1) to conceive, design, and then execute a brand (or brands) with sustainable appeal and increasing value; (2) to create an environment within which imagination, courage, and drive can be nourished; (3) to \\"go long\\" by executing a strategy by which to achieve rapid growth with business models that scale rapidly and thereby establishes market supremacy which puts \\"the game out of reach\\" from competition; (4) to dominate with the most appropriate POP \\"locations\\" which could include retail outlets, perhaps, but also catalogs, Web sites, telemarketing, couponding, and appropriate strategic alliances; and to \\"push the envelope\\" of brand leadership through innovation which invigorates product or service, design, customer service, and quality...\\"over and over again.\\"<br /><br />The material is carefully organized within four Parts: Make No Little Plans (Chapters 1-7), Go Long (Chapters 8-11), Own Main & Main (Chapters 12-15), and Push the Envelope (Chapters 16 and 17). Most of the recommendations provided in each Part are based on Rubinfeld's extensive real-world experience while serving as Starbucks' executive vice president, and, on Hemingway's equally extensive experience while serving as Microsoft's director of business development and international marketing. He is also the co-author with Bill Gates of Business @ the Speed of Thought. Of great importance to me is the fact that only about 20-25% of this book discusses principles and everything else focuses on implementation, execution, achieving objectives, performance, etc. Rubinfeld and Hemingway's intellectual rigor is evident throughout their narrative. Guided by sound theories and plausible hypotheses, they take a holistic approach while concentrating on specific mental and business models as well as strategies, tactics, values, and applications which are essential to sustainable business growth...\\"around the street or across the globe.\\"<br /><br />Well-done!elope\\" of brand leadership through innovation which invigorates product or service, design, customer service, and quality...\\"over and over again.\\"    The material is carefully organized within four Parts: Make No Little Plans (Chapters 1-7), Go Long (Chapters 8-11), Own Main & Main (Chapters 12-15), and Push the Envelope (Chapters 16 and 17).

At the outset, please bear with me as I defer to Shane to explain why Finding Fertile Ground may be of interest and value: \\"This book is different from most books on entrepreneurship in three important ways: First, the book focuses on what matters the most for successful entrepreneurship -- picking a good opportunity for starting a new business -- rather than what most people write about -- the attributes of successful entrepreneurs....This book is also different from most books on entrepreneurship, which focus on [begin italics] how [end italics] to get a new company started rather than on what kind of business is a good one to start....Moreover, this book takes the idea of explaining how to pick the right business seriously by developing a framework of rules for success that are based on academic research which shows the things that makes companies successful....[and also] focuses on how to identify a business concept that can support the development of a successful technology-based company.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the narrative, Shane focuses his reader's attention on \\"the key actions that you should take to come up with an opportunity that will support, and even foster, the creation of a new high technology company [which achieves and then sustains profitability].\\" He identifies ten \\"Key Lessons\\" and devotes a separate chapter to each. The \\"lessons\\" are arranged in a sequence of \\"key actions\\" which begin with selecting the right industry (Chapter 1) and conclude with managing risk and uncertainty (Chapter 10). It is noteworthy that, unlike so most other business books, this one does not provide a series of \\"To Do\\" lists; rather, a series of \\"Stop! Don't Do It!\\" lists. Shane also strategically places clusters of \\"Questions to Ask Yourself\\" so that the reader is challenged, at each step of the way, to address key issues. For example, it is in Chapter 6 that Shane explains how to exploit established company weaknesses. One of the questions asks \\"How can I take advantage of the way large established firms reward people when I found my new firm?\\"<br /><br />At one point, Shane suggests that \\"being a successful entrepreneur is much like being as good professional gambler. If you know the games where the odds are least stacked in favor of the house, and you understand the rules of the game you are playing, you can greatly improve your chances of winning. Following the rules outlined in this book will help you identify the fertile ground -- a truly extraordinary business opportunity that will foster the development of a new high-technology company.\\"<br /><br />Eileen C. Shapiro and Howard H. Stevenson wrote a recently published book, Make Your Own Luck, in which they identify and then discuss 12 practical steps to taking smarter risks in business. They obviously agree with Shane that the success rate of one's business gambles can be improved -- sometimes substantially -- once understanding what the \\"rules\\" of the given \\"game\\" are as well as when and where there are the best \\"odds\\" to play it.<br /><br />Presumably this will be true of at least some readers: After reading this book and completing the self-audit exercises, they conclude that they should not proceed with plans to launch a new firm. Other readers who do proceed should keep in mind the chilling statistics which Michael Gerber cites in his recently published book, E-Myth Mastery: \\"Of the 1 million U.S. small businesses started this year [2005], more than 80% of them will be out of business within 5 years and 96% will have closed their doors before their 10th birthday.\\"<br /><br />Shane's advice will certainly be of substantial value to those thinking about launching a new firm but it can also be of substantial value to others who are thinking about expanding into (what is for them) an entirely new market and/or thinking about introducing (what is for them) an entirely new product or service. Whatever the \\"game\\" may be, whatever the nature of the \\"gamble,\\" it is importantto keep in mind that -- more often than not -- what seems to be \\"fertile ground\\" for opportunity proves to be a graveyard for inept entrepreneurship.<br /><br />Obviously, I hold this volume in high regard and appreciate the CD which Wharton School Publishing provides with it, a value-added benefit indeed. Those who share that regard are urged to check out the aforementioned Make Your Own Luck and E-Myth Mastery as well as Evan I. Schwartz' Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors, W.

Without the din and prattle of bureaucracy, people listen as well as talk; and since there are fewer of them they generally know and understand each other. Second, small companies move faster. They know the penalties for hesitation in the marketplace. Third, in small companies, with fewer layers and less camouflage, the leaders show up very clearly on the screen. Their performance and its impact are clear to everyone. And, finally, smaller companies waste less. They spend less time in endless reviews and approvals and politics and paper drills. They have fewer people; therefore they can only do the important things. Their people are free to direct their energy and attention toward the marketplace rather than fighting bureaucracy.\\"<br /><br />In his E-Myth Mastery, Michael Gerber cites the following statistics: \\"Of the 1 million U.S. small businesses started this year [2005], more than 80% of them will be out of business within 5 years and 96% will have closed their doors before their 10th birthday.\\" Everything Welch says is true in terms of the potential advantages which small businesses have and the statistics which Gerber cites suggests that very few of them know how to achieve and then sustain those advantages.<br /><br />I include these quotations now because they are directly relevant to what Miller and Le Breton-Miller offer in their own book, Managing for the Long Run. For owners and other decision-makers now involved with family businesses, they explain HOW to achieve and then sustain a competitive advantage. True, various  \\"lessons\\" were  revealed by the authors' rigorous and extensive research on a number of family-controlled businesses (FCB) which have become major corporations, notably Cargill, Hallmark Cards, L.L. Bean, Motorola, and Wal-Mart.<br /><br />It is important to remember, however, that all of them had modest origins and during that perilous period encountered most (if not all) of the same challenges which FCB start-ups now face. Most of the most valuable business books were written to answer critically important questions. In this instance: What distinguishes great family businesses? (Please see Chapter 1.) A related question: What are the \\"potent priorities\\" of great family-controlled businesses? (Please see Chapter 2.) Another related question: Why do so many family-controlled businesses stumble? (Please see Chapter 8.) In between Chapters 2 and 8, Miller and Le Breton-Miller focus on five primary characteristics: brand building, craftsmanship, operations, innovation, and deal making. They devote a separate chapter to each. I prefer not to list their key points which are best revealed within the narrative's frame-of-reference and sequential context. However, I now express my appreciation of various Tables and Grids which so efficiently illustrate the cohesion, indeed interdependence of what the authors characterize as \\"The Four Cs\\": Command, Continuity, Community, and Connections.<br /><br />All of the specific mental and business models, strategies, tactics, values, and applications which Miller and Le Breton-Miller recommend are based on their conviction that \\"the only way to sustain good performance is to [begin italics] act in the best interests of the company and all its stakeholders. [end italics] First, boards and top managers must be motivated to be courageous and farsighted stewards. Second, they need to concentrate on and invest deeply in a substantive, enduring mission. Third, they must assemble a unified, value-driven staff that uses its initiative for the interests of the whole firm. Finally, they must form enduring, win-win relationships with external partners.\\"<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Gerber's most recent E-Myth book.

The content is rock-solid and thought-provoking. Waters' suggestions and recommendations are eminently practical. This book is also written with a style which has Snap! Crackle! and Pop! Usually an A to Z organizing principle is merely a gimmick. Not so in this instance. Waters offers a series of brief but stimulating discussions of 26 subjects which range from A (Antennae by which to \\"tune in to the little things, the trivial nuances, and the irrelevant data which everyone else misses\\") to Z (Zen which embraces opposites, paradoxes, contradictions, etc. while celebrating duality and embraces polarity). Waters urges her reader to learn to practice \\"the Zen of trend.\\"<br /><br />As she carefully differentiates, a \\"trend tracker\\" is someone who is alert for indications that help his or her business to stay [begin italics] up to the minute [end italics] whereas what she calls a \\"Trendmaster\\" uses that information to determine [begin italics] where that minute is going [end italics]. Years ago when asked to explain his effectiveness as a hockey player, Wayne Gretzky replied that others know where the puck is while he knows where it is going to be. Larry Bird once said that when he played basketball, he saw plays develop as if in slow motion and he could \\"see\\" exactly what would happen next. There are countless other examples of precisely the same skills on which Waters focuses, all of which almost anyone can possess and then improve.<br /><br />She may be overstating the case when suggesting that what she recommends is a \\"new way of looking at the world.\\" The fact remains, however, that her insights will seem \\"new\\" to those readers who were previously unaware of \\"the invisibility of the obvious\\" and may have been captive to what Jim O'Toole calls \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" As a result, they have failed to recognize seemingly insignificant indications of emerging trends which (sooner rather than later) determine success or failure in any competitive marketplace.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, especially to decision-makers in small-to-midsize companies which have limited resources and thus must somehow do more and do it better, do it sooner, and with less. I agree with Warren Buffett who said something to the effect that \\"price is what you charge but value is what others think it's worth.\\" This is especially true of current and prospective customers. Mastering the use of various tools which Waters provides will help each reader to become a Trendmaster. Because trends evolve in sometimes unexpected directions, the same tools and skills can then be used to make necessary adjustments of the given strategies and tactics.<br /><br />Waters includes a brief section, Recommended Reading, in which she lists a number of outstanding sources. To them I presume to add five others: Thomas S. Kuhns's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Joel A. Barker's Paradigms: The Business of Discovering the Future, Eileen C. Shapiro and Howard H. Stevenson's Make Your Own Luck: 12 Practical Steps to Taking Smarter Risks in Business, and two by William Bridges, Transitions and Managing Transitions. To varying degrees, all five of these books develop in much greater depth several of Waters' core concepts.<br /><br />She does include Seth Godin's Purple Cow on her list (which I think is terrific) but his recently published All Marketers Are Liars is, in my opinion, even more relevant to those who intend to become a Trendmaster.

Without the din and prattle of bureaucracy, people listen as well as talk; and since there are fewer of them they generally know and understand each other. Second, small companies move faster. They know the penalties for hesitation in the marketplace. Third, in small companies, with fewer layers and less camouflage, the leaders show up very clearly on the screen. Their performance and its impact are clear to everyone. And, finally, smaller companies waste less. They spend less time in endless reviews and approvals and politics and paper drills. They have fewer people; therefore they can only do the important things. Their people are free to direct their energy and attention toward the marketplace rather than fighting bureaucracy.\\" Next, some observations by Michael Gerber: \\"Of the 1 million U.S. small businesses started this year [2005], more than 80% of them will be out of business within 5 years and 96% will have closed their doors before their 10th birthday.\\"<br /><br />Everything Welch says is true in terms of the potential advantages which small businesses have and the statistics which Gerber cites suggest that very few of them know how to achieve and then sustain those advantages. As Harpst explains, this book was written for decision-makers in established small businesses which, typically, employ 10 to 100 people. How does his book differ from others which also discuss business improvement? \\"First, [unlike most other books] which focus 80% on principles and 20% on implementation, this book's content [begin italics] is focused 20% on principles and 80% on implementation [end italics]....Second, the [Six Disciplines] Methodology is [begin italics] designed specifically for small businesses [end italics]....Third, the Six Disciplines Methodology is the first methodology to [begin italics] distill and integrate what were designed as separate best practices into one cohesive whole [end italics].\\"<br /><br />Harpst devotes a separate chapter to each of the six Disciplines: Decide What's Important, Set Goals That Lead, Align Systems, Work the Plan, Innovate Purposefully, and Step Back. True to his word, Harpst focuses most of his attention on HOW to derive maximum benefit from each of the six separate but interdependent Disciplines. In my opinion, he has positioned them in the most appropriate sequence, helping his reader to understand that business improvement must be viewed and initiated as a cohesive and comprehensive process. He correctly emphasizes the importance of definition, clarification, identification, measurement, evaluation, and when appropriate, modification and adjustment. Each small business really is a \\"work in process\\" which, hopefully, involves progress or improvement rather than deterioration.<br /><br />Over the years, I have worked closely with hundreds of small companies and agree with the owner/CEO of one of them who confided that he viewed his own company as it were a young grandchild entrusted to his care. \\"I have to keep an eye on it all the time. Be alert to potential dangers. Let it wander a bit but keep it away from trouble. Make sure it is safe. Feed it. Clean it. Provide love and care and support and encouragement. But make certain that it knows what the rules are...and follows them. Let it have fun but not break anything. Sometimes it's exhausting but I love it!\\"<br /><br />To me, Chapter 6 (Discipline III: Align Systems) is especially valuable. In it, Harpst explains how to identify and then correct misalignments in areas such as processes, policies, measures (i.e. metrics), technologies, and people. All of these business components are interdependent. That is to say, it is difficult (if not impossible) to measure human performance accurately if competent people are not involved in the right process, guided by the right policies, following the right procedures, and provided with the right resources (e.g. hardware, software, equipment, work environment). Conversely, business improvement cannot be achieved by incompetent and untrainable people, however appropriate the given processes, policies, measures, and technologies may be. Proper alignment must include everyone and everything. Harpst explains how such alignment can be achieved and then sustained.<br /><br />Before concluding this commentary, I presume to suggest that many decision-makers in all organizations (regardless of size or nature) demonstrate what  Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert I. Sutton characterize as \\"The Knowing-Doing Gap\\": they have at least an adequate understanding of what business improvement requires but, for whatever reasons, fail to achieve it. Books such as Harpst's are essentially worthless unless and until the information and counsel they provide are applied effectively to the needs of a given organization. Darrell Royal was correct when asserting that \\"potential\\" means \\"you ain't done it yet.\\"<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Steven S.

221717:US	51147790	R2R879YADYZXUA	0071457801	13816005	Jack Welch and the 4 E's of Leadership: How to Put GE's Leadership Formula to Work in Your Organization	Books	5	26	27	N	N	A Brilliant Synthesis, Eloquently Expressed	I greatly admire Krames's previous books, notably The Welch Way: 24 Lessons From The World's Greatest CEO and What the Best CEOs Know: 7 Exceptional Leaders and Their Lessons for Transforming Any Business. He is an exceptionally clear and insightful thinker. In this volume, Krames focuses on the \\"4E Leadership Model,\\" an abbreviation of \\"The GE Authentic Leadership Model\\" which Welch introduced to GE almost ten years ago. Previously, Welch had stressed Head, Heart, and Guts. Eventually, he recognized the need for a more fully developed concept which could guide and inform the development of leaders within the GE organization. It should also be noted that he hired Noel Tichy to head up a management training center for GE to which Welch then committed about 20% of his time.<br /><br />Welch believed that there are essentially three different types of leaders: Type A's live the values and make the numbers, Type B's live the values but do not always make the numbers, and Type C's do not live the values but may make the numbers. To Welch, the A's were GE's \\"best and brightest,\\" the B's were the ones who received the most intensive training, and (with very few exceptions) C's were strongly advised to seek new career opportunities elsewhere. Welch discusses all this in his own recently published book, Winning. Here are some brief excerpts:<br /><br />\\"The first E is positive energy. For example, they start the day with enthusiasm and usually end it that way too, rarely seeming to tire in the middle. They don't complain about working hard; they love to work. They love to play. People with positive energy just enjoy life.<br /><br />\\"The second E is the ability to energize others. Positive energy is the ability to get other people revved up. People who energize can inspire their team to  take on the impossible -- and enjoy the hell out of doing it. In fact, people would arm wrestle for the chance to work with them.<br /><br />\\"The third E is edge, the courage to make tough yes-or-no decisions. [Those with edge] know when to stop assessing and make a tough call, even without total information.<br /><br />\\"The fourth E is execute -- the ability to get the job done.... It turns out you can have positive energy, energize everyone around you, make hard calls, and still not get over the finish line. Being able to execute is a special and distinct skill. It means a person knows how to put decisions into action and push them forward to completion, through resistance, chaos, or unexpected obstacles. People who can execute know that winning is about results.<br /><br />What else?<br /><br />\\"Passion! By that I mean a heartfelt, deep, and authentic excitement about work. People with passion care -- really care in their bones -- about colleagues, employees, and friends winning. They love to learn and grow, and they get a huge kick when people around them do the same. The funny thing about people with passion, though, is they usually aren't excited just about work. They tend to be passionate about everything!...they just have juice for life in their veins.\\"<br /><br />Krames does a brilliant job of organizing and presenting material in such a way that his reader can more easily understand it and, of greater importance, then put it to effective use. Krames agrees that \\"winning is about results\\" and does all he can to help his reader understand both the WHY and the HOW of \\"The Four E's of Leadership.\\" He offers a self-audit in the Introduction (pages 18 and 19) followed by the first of several \\"4E Leader to Do\\" lists with which Krames concludes each of the chapters in Part I.<br /><br />In Part II, he shifts his attention to \\"Leadership Lessons\\" to be learned from five of GE's \\"4E All-Stars\\": Jeff Immelt, James McNerney, Larry Bossidy, Robert Nardelli, and Vivek Paul. He devotes a separate chapter to each, again concluding all of the five chapters with an appropriate \\"4E Leader to Do\\" list. Yes, almost all of the material which Krames discusses can be found in other sources, including Welch's book and others written by Krames as well as Robert Slater's Jack Welch & The G.E. Way: Management Insights and Leadership Secrets of the Legendary CEO. What makes this book so valuable is the fact that, as indicated earlier, Krames presents the material within a framework which helps the reader not only to understand the core leadership concepts but also to understand HOW to apply them effectively within her or his own organization.<br /><br />One final point: Welch and Krames would be among the first to point out that there is no one \\"formula\\" which guarantees business success. However, the one which has proven so successful at GE affirms values and suggests core concepts, strategies, and tactics which -- if properly understood and then effectively applied -- can substantially assist the achievement of such success.en by Krames as well as Robert Slater's Jack Welch & The G.E.

223359:US	51147790	R1KV2IBN3TSBGE	1591392888	311957778	Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Invention Is the Mother of Necessity	Schwartz brilliantly explains \\"the creative fuel that drives world-class inventors\\" while explaining, also, that each of them followed a process by which to create possibilities. More specifically, by pinpointing problems to be solved, recognizing what are usually interconnected patterns, \\"channeling chance\\" (i.e. serendipity), eliminating or transcending boundaries, detecting barriers inorder to remove or overcome them, recognizing and applying appropriate analogies, visualizing probable results, embracing each failure as a learning opportunity, \\"multiplying insights\\" as they reveal themselves, and at all times \\"thinking schematically\\" (i.e. cohesively). Yes, that's a mouthful but essentially what the process of invention involves. It bears striking similarities with how the human mind functions. Here is a brief excerpt from Schwartz's Prologue:<br /><br />\\"The brain's hundreds of billions of neurons, or nerve cells, fire signals across tiny gaps known as synapses. These neurotransmitter signals travel across billions of pathways, often making new connections along the way. One of the mind's many astounding feats is that this network of neural circuits can operate and grow while consuming only a quarter of the electrical power that drives a modern microprocessor, or about twenty watts. This internally produced electricity is our juice.\\" All of the inventors whom Schwartz discusses in this book channeled this \\"juice\\" the right way. By making new and unexpected connections,  they produced that special form of creativity known as invention.<br /><br />According to Nikola Tesla (the inventor of alternating current), \\"cognitive LEDs\\" (i.e. the electrical energy of invention) races through both the mind and heart. In common parlance, this is often referred to as a \\"rush\\": forces of intellectual and emotional energy achieve together what Joseph Schumpeter once described as \\"creative destruction.\\" This is precisely what Schwartz has in mind when noting that by \\"isolating a problem in a new way, by redefining it, by focusing it down to something more specific than meets the average eye, the inventor constructs a new possibility where none was thought to have existed.\\"<br /><br />Among the inventors whom Schwartz discusses, those of greatest interest to me are Woody Norris, Alexander Graham Bell, Jay Walker, Lee Hood, Carl Crawford and Kevin King, Dean Kamen, and Ron Katz. Here are brief excerpts about four of them:<br /><br />Woody Norris: He \\"was engaging in a common habit of inventive engineering: taking a technology of technique that works in one domain -- in this case Dopler radar detection of aircraft or weather patterns -- and then repurposing it for a new problem space. Was Norris the first inventor to think of this basic idea of diagnostic ultrasound? Hardly. But he imagined the possibility without knowledge of other efforts. Throughout history, most epochal inventions have been born in a rush of nearly simultaneous discovery.\\" (page 18)<br /><br />Alexander Graham Bell: After a series of partially successful experiments, Bell became convinced that he had \\"found a way for [begin italics] continuous [end italics] patterns of electricity to carry almost any type of sound over wires....Bell's method, however,  was anything but a linear progression -- the first problem leading to a second, leading to a third, and so on. Instead, his diverse investigations led to an explosion of puzzles, a simultaneous eruption of new possibilities that sent him down parallel paths that he eventually connected.\\" (page 24)<br /><br />Jay Walker: He has defined challenges in a unique way which provides a competitive advantage. For example, he conceived Priceline.com as an intricate system which enables consumers to trade off flight preferences (i.e. non-stop flights, departure and arrival times) for lower prices; it also enables airlines to unload unsold tickets (i.e. \\"excess capacity\\").  \\"In recent years, he has been averaging about one hundred patent filings annually. With more than two hundred fifty issued patents and more than six hundred pending,\\" Walker and his colleagues at Walker Digital continue to focus on specific target areas of opportunity. For example, they wonder why current slot machines are lackluster and why winning is based on mere chance. \\"Why isn't skill a factor in winning at slots?\\" Re current generation cash registers, \\"Why do cashiers give customers their change? Why not find a systematic way to offer additional products in lieu of money?\\" (page 43)<br /><br />Lee Hood: \\"The ultimate system is the biological system. That the human body is a system of systems has been known for ages.\\" So what's new? Hood and his associates are convinced that the history of medicine has been about diagnosing and treating disease. The future, by contrast, is all about predicting and then preventing disease. \\"If you ask me what the technology of the future will be in biological medicine,\\" Schwartz quotes Hood asserting, \\"it is utterly clear: microfluidics coupled with nanotechnology.\\" Hence his vision of \\"capturing an instantaneous genetic health snapshot of an individual, to see whether any genes are mutating and whether any cancers might be forming in the near future.\\" To obtain tremendous amounts of information from tiny samples of blood, \\"you create groups of microscopic robots, essentially reducing an entire laboratory to the size of a fingernail.\\"(page 201)<br /><br />The work of these and other inventors demonstrates what Schwartz calls \\"the cycle of thinking strategies: creating new opportunities, pinpointing new problems, recognizing new patterns, detecting new barriers, and so forth.\\" This is a never-ending process. If conducted with rigor, it is also  ever-expanding because each new solution creates all manner of new problems which, in turn, create all manner of learning opportunities which, in turn, facilitate new solutions which, in turn....<br /><br />In his Epilogue, Schwartz devotes substantial attention to Ashok Khosla who sees three proven models that can turn poor nations into rich ones: copycatting, piggybacking, and leapfrogging. Khosla is currently focused on India's rural poor, the 70% of the population who have been \\"untouched\\" by global outsourcing. He is an archetypical example of the inventor as entrepreneur with a social conscience and a determination to help as many people as possible to escape the cycle of poverty. To achieve that admirable objective, Khosla practices the same \\"cycle of thinking strategies\\" as do all other world-class inventors. For example, he recognized that poor people need places to live; ways to produce their own clothing locally, to cook food, to purify water; and cheap renewable energy. \\"Borrowing ideas he has seen all over the world,\\" Khosla has invented a series of new products to meet those basic needs. All can be produced with locally available materials. He has also devised a franchising system by which local dealerships can distribute new technologies and train people to use them.<br /><br />I agree with Schwartz that there has never been a prior time when the need for inventions was greater, inventions which can alleviate and eventually eliminate the world's problems in areas such as healthcare, nutrition, and education. It is Schwartz's expressed hope that those who read this book will be better prepared to \\"turn on the juice\\" of their own inventiveness. \\"We know that brainstorms are electrical, and you need to have many of them if you want to change the world....

According to Hatherley, those who aspire to become leaders must dare to be different when attempting to overcome what Jim O'Toole has characterized as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" Hatherley's objectives when writing this book were to help his reader to broaden her or his attitude about management, to raise awareness about leading, and to provide the tools to make that happen. For purposes of illustration, he offers \\"two variations of management style that can best be described as the Monarch and the Muralist\\": Monarchs are managers chained to the past by tradition, written and \\"unwritten\\" rules, manuals of procedure, the chain of command, etc. whereas Muralists meet Hatherley's criteria for leadership in that they know their roles, execute their responsibilities understand their interdependence with associates, recognize the value of their contributions to fulfilling the given mission, and clearly envision success, both for the enterprise and for themselves. Quarrel if you will with such nomenclature (e.g. Monarchs and Muralists) but Hatherley's distinctions are sound.<br /><br />The most effective managers are indeed leaders: They attract and energize followers; they are both willing and able to take calculated, prudent risks; they collaborate with their associates to manage circumstances; and finally, unlike Monarchs, Muralists view leadership as a privilege, not as an entitlement. One of Hatherley's most valuable concepts is what he calls \\"The Leadership Compass\\" which he explains in Chapter 20. (Details are best revealed during a careful reading of pages 121-130.) According to Hatherley, the objective of The Leadership Compass is \\"to help leaders maximize performance by recognizing both organizational and individual strengths and weaknesses, then creating the appropriate courses of improvement to change the dynamics and improve the results.\\" Obviously, both courage and endurance are required when daring to challenge \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\"<br /><br />Given the number of outstanding books on leadership already in print, I admire anyone who writes another.  It takes a special kind of courage to dare to be different when discussing that business subject. I enjoy Hatherley's wit.  Also the fact that he establishes and then sustains a personal, conversational, almost intimate rapport with his reader. I do not damn with faint praise when commending him for presenting his material effectively while suggesting that there is very little (if any) cutting-edge thinking in this book. (If there were, my rating would be higher.) He concludes with a list of 12 key points, all of  which have already been discussed -- and in greater depth -- by countless other business thinkers such as Bennis, Buckingham, Collins, Drucker, Heifetz, and Kotter. However, these points can guide and inform the development of at least some managers to become a \\"Muralist\\" and then a \\"Mentor-Leader.\\"rance are required when daring to challenge \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\"     Given the number of outstanding books on leadership already in print, I admire anyone who writes another.

226467:US	51147790	R2WWBION4O55PM	0787973718	715914760	Squirrel Inc.: A Fable of Leadership through Storytelling	Books	5	11	15	N	Y	Nuts R Us	Think about it. Who are among the greatest storytellers throughout history? My own list includes Homer, Plato, Chaucer, Aesop, Jesus, Dante, Boccaccio, the Brothers Grimm, Confucius, Abraham Lincoln, Hans Christian Andersen, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), Joel Chandler Harris, L. Frank Baum, and most recently, E.B. White. Whatever the genre (epic, parable, fable, allegory, anecdote, etc.), each used exposition, description, and narration to illustrate what they considered to be fundamental truths about the human condition.<br /><br />In his previous work, The Springboard, Denning focuses on \\"how storytelling ignites action in knowledge-led organizations\\" and does so with uncommon erudition, precision, and eloquence. His narrative covers a period of approximately three years during which he used what he calls \\"springboard\\" stories to \\"spark organizational change\\" at The World Bank. More specifically, to forge a consensus within that organization to support the design and then implementation of effective knowledge management, first for itself and then for its clients worldwide. How he accomplished that objective is in and of itself a fascinating \\"story\\" but the book's greater value lies in what he learned in process, lessons which are directly relevant to virtually all other organizations (regardless of size or nature) which struggle to \\"do more with less and do it faster\\" in the so-called Age of Information. Maximizing use of their collective intellectual capital is most often the single most effective way to do that.<br /><br />In this volume, Denning uses many of the same devices which Orwell does in Animal Farm: He creates a stressful situation to which anthropomorphic animals respond; the lead characters discuss what to do; strategies are selected; conflicts and crises immediately develop; tension is increased by the perils the lead characters encounter; ultimately, the situation is resolved. In Animal Farm, the pigs prevail. In Squirrel Inc.,....<br /><br />Whereas Orwell's purpose is to dramatize the evils of totalitarianism, Denning's purpose is to give \\"detailed advice on how to craft and perform a story that can spark transformational change in an organization\\" by examining six different kinds of storytelling \\"which illustrate the impact of storytelling on our work and our lives.\\" Although this is a fable of leadership, it is important to keep in mind that (a) everyone throughout any organization tells stories of various kinds each day; therefore (b) the value of the information which Denning provides and the recommendations he makes is by no means limited to senior-level executives.<br /><br />Why a fable? When considering how he could best communicate the various kinds of stories (e.g. \\"springboard\\" stories that communicate complex ideas and spark action), their specific uses in modern organizations, and their relevant similarities and differences, Denning \\"quickly discovered that conveying an understanding of seven types of stories across four or five different dimensions represented a level of complexity not well adapted to text-book style presentation.\\"<br /><br />I include that excerpt because many of those who read this book will also find themselves in situations in which they are preparing to make an especially important presentation and use of a traditional format is not appropriate. Their audience will not respond as well to the \\"textbook-style\\" as they will to a entertaining as well as informative narrative which seeks to achieve one or more of these objectives:<br /><br />To spark action<br />To communicate who the speaker is<br />To transmit values<br />To get everyone working together<br />To share knowledge<br />To \\"tame the grapevine\\"<br />To lead people into the future<br /><br />Here's the situation. Diana is a fast-track executive at Squirrel Inc. who is frustrated by her inability to convince senior-management to transform the company's core business from helping squirrels to bury nuts to storing nuts for them. Why should it? Because approximately 50% of the nuts buried are lost, either because squirrels forget where they buried them or the nuts are dug up by human gardeners. Great opportunity for Squirrel Inc. She shares her frustrations with Bartender who is the owner/host of a nectar tavern located high in an oak tree near the Squirrel Inc. headquarters. (He is also this book's narrator and thus, in several respects, a surrogate for Denning.) Throughout the remainder of the book, Denning focuses on Diana and Bartender's joint efforts to use effective storytelling to mobilize the support needed to transform Squirrel Inc.<br /><br />Because Denning is himself a master storyteller, never does his narrative become precious, cute, quaint, darling, etc. Credit him with wit, style, grace, and -- yes -- intellectual rigor. His characters may be squirrels but the relevance of his material to human experience is profound: \\"The underlying reason for the affinity between leadership and storytelling is simple: narrative -- unlike abstraction and analysis -- is inherently collaborative. Storytelling helps leaders work with other individuals as coparticipants, not merely as objects or underlings. Storytelling helps strengthen leaders' connectedness with the world. Isn't this what all leaders need -- a connectedness with the people they are seeking to lead?\\"<br /><br />I especially appreciate Denning's provision of a chart (\\"Seven High-Value Forms of Organizational Storytelling,\\" pages 150-153) which clearly and cleverly summarizes all of his core concepts and specific suggestions. It serves as a useful reminder that the most effective story is one which has a crystal clear objective and includes the appropriate elements (e.g. problem to be solved, situation to be explained, value of the information provided). The story must also meet certain requirements of the given purpose. For example, provision of relevant background information and an analysis of current situation before proposing a future course of action, especially one which may seem bold and threatening to others.<br /><br />For whatever reasons, only in recent years has there been an awareness and appreciation of the importance of the business narrative. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Annette Simmons' The Story Factor, Doug Lipman's Improving Your Storytelling, and Storytelling in Organizations co-authored by John Seely Brown, Denning, Katarina Groh, and Laurence Prusak.buried are lost, either because squirrels forget where they buried them or the nuts are dug up by human gardeners.

For others such as I, this book achieves Suri's expressed objective which is indicated when she wonders how  \\"designers might be influenced [by the images provided of] visual evidence of the realities of everyday behavior, of design in use. Might reference to such images help designers to be more sensitive to people's experience and needs?\\" Her hope is that those who see them \\"will take this same lens to the real world to enrich their own perceptions....The key is looking carefully at what people actually do in various situations and asking [themselves] various questions\\" to explain what they see. Suri explains that she and her associates at IDEO constantly observe common, everyday human experiences (i.e. \\"thoughtless acts\\") to stimulate, guide, and sustain \\"intuitive design.\\"<br /><br />Suri explains how this process highlights human needs and problems worth solving; frees designers from existing paradigms through a focus on action; reveals what is intuitive and thereby supports the design of appropriate \\"cues\\" (i.e. that which evoke recognition the purpose and accessibility of products, spaces, and services when designing them); tunes designers into relevant cultural patterns and meanings; uncovers significant, often overlooked emotional experiences; harnesses tacit knowledge which inform the design process; and inspires more flexible and enduring solutions to unmet needs.<br /><br />Of special interest to me is that the photos in this volume capture moments which are comparable with those I experience in my own life. Oh sure, I have been aware of such images but, until sharing Suri's perspectives, I seldom (if ever) gave much thought to them as resources for stimulating new or improved ideas about human relationships, the aesthetics and utility of commonplace products and services, and the physical environment within which people as well as products and services interact. Adults can learn much from children about what is referred to as \\"the invisibility of the obvious.\\" Those who question that should take a long walk in the woods with (let's say) a four-year old. Children notice so much that adults do not. Suri has reminded me of how interesting, and sometimes how valuable \\"thoughtless acts\\" can be.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Tom Kelley's  The Art of Innovation: Lessons in Creativity from IDEO,  America's Leading Design Firm. His book seamlessly complements Suri's. Also check out Donald A. Norman's Emotional Design: Why We Love (Or Hate) Everyday Things and The Design of Everyday Things, and, Alan Cooper and Robert M.

It came as no surprise, therefore, that Trump agreed to cooperate with Slater on the writing of this book but only after checking him out with those who had already had a close working relationship with him, notably Jack Welch. There is probably no other executive who has a tighter schedule than does Trump. However, on numerous occasions, beginning in June of 2004, he agreed to meet with Slater or talk with him on the telephone. Trump also arranged for Slater to attend various private meetings related to Trump's building projects; to travel with him to a building site in Manhattan and observe his inspection of it; to journey with Trump for a book promotion appearance at QVC, the shopping channel; and to fly with him on his jet to a \\"demolition party\\" in Chicago where Trump planned to build a 90-story $800-million luxury tower on what had been the site of the Chicago Sun-Times. Slater was also allowed to observe a casting call for the third season of The Apprentice television program at during the filming of one of the episodes for its third season. Finally, Trump helped to facilitate many of the interviews of those best qualified to discuss both his business career and the celebrity synonymous with it.<br /><br />Trump is as protective of the privacy of his three children as he is eager to discuss almost anything and anyone else. Nonetheless, he allowed Slater to meet with one son (Donald Trump, Jr.) and apparently set no restrictions on what they could discuss. Presumably Trump allowed such direct and extensive access, both to himself and to countless others, because he trusted Slater, was favorably impressed by his professional credentials, sensed his inherent integrity, and believed that he would receive fair and circumspect treatment in what later became this book.<br /><br />With regard to its title, it is Slater's opinion that, at least for now, \\"there seems to be no downside\\" to all the attention Trump has so actively sought and has so substantially achieved. \\"His look of giddy pleasure at the amount of attention he is [currently] getting says it all. He savors having so many choices to make [i.e. he is inundated with participation proposals of various kinds] that put him in the public spotlight. If he could, one imagines, he would not make a choice at all. He would do everything. After all, in Donald Trump's world, there is no such thing as over-exposure.\\" At least for now.<br /><br />Proportionality is a key element in Slater's earlier discussions of other prominent executives such as John Chambers, George Soros, and Jack Welch and it is also true of what he has to say about Trump. Obviously, there is much that Slater admires but much else which Slater finds irritating (at best) and sometimes infuriating (at worst). Of greatest interest to me is Slater's explanation of how and why Trump \\"openly names his products after himself and markets his name as synonymous with his products: his luxury residences, his casino hotels, and so on. [Trump] insists, as well -- correctly, at it turns out -- that using his name on his company products enhances their value.\\" (Please see Chapter 8, \\"Branding a Name.\\") I was also interested in learning about certain differences between the public Trump and the private Trump. For example, that he seldom fires anyone in the Trump organization and, generally, is far more patient, forgiving, generous, and deferential than his public persona suggests.<br /><br />More a quibble than a complaint, I wish Slater had included (perhaps as an appendix) an annotated Timeline of the key dates and defining moments in Trump's career thus far. For example, when and why he decided to become a commercial real estate developer in Manhattan, Atlantic City, Chicago, and Las Vegas; also, when and why he agreed to produce and star in The Apprenticetelevision program. Slater addresses these and other issues within his narrative. However, given the complexity of Trump's various business activities, it would be helpful to have a chronological frame-of-reference to consult periodically, one which clarifies when, what, with whom, where, etc.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Slater's earlier work, notably Jack Welch and the GE Way: Management Insights and Leadership Secrets of the Legendary CEO; Microsoft Rebooted: How Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer Reinvented Their Company; SOROS: The Unauthorized Biography, the Life, Times and Trading Secrets of the World's Greatest Investor;  The Wal-Mart Decade: How a New Generation of Leaders Turned Sam Walton's Legacy into the World's #1 Company; Saving Big Blue: Leadership Lessons & Turnaround Tactics of IBM's Lou Gerstner; and Get Better or Get Beaten!: 31 Leadership Secrets from GE's Jack Welch.resses these and other issues within his narrative.

(Purple, of Course)	Obviously, the purpose of this title is to attract attention. And it does. When you begin to read this book, ignore the title (at least for a while) and focus on Godin's narrative. The appropriateness of Godin's title is best revealed during the development of that lively narrative. As always, his ideas and writing style have Snap! Crackle! and Pop! Think of Godin as a cereal thinker.     In this volume, he offers his own profile of a great story: It is true, not because it is factual but because it is consistent and authentic; it offers a promise (e.g. enlightenment, entertainment, inspiration); it can be trusted because it is (to repeat) consistent and authentic; it is subtle; its impact \\"happens fast\\"; it appeals (preferably) to all of our senses (seldom, if ever to our logic); it is crafted for a specific audience; it does not contradict itself; and finally, it is in alignment with what its audience already knows, feels, believes, etc. Re the last point, a great story offers a reminder and a reassurance while, paradoxically, challenging conventional wisdom. Above all, it commands attention. Godin's profile of a great story also describes the most effective marketing campaigns.    Here's a question: What do Aesop, Jesus Christ, the Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, Abraham Lincoln, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), Joel Chandler Harris, and L. Frank Baum have in common? Answer: All were great storytellers who, obviously, can come in all shapes and sizes. One of Godin's most important points is that almost anyone can be a great storyteller IF they (a) have a convincing, indeed compelling story to tell and (b) they tell it to the right audience.    Albeit taken out of context, here are a few brief quotations which are representative of Godin's thinking:    \\"Every consumer has a worldview that affects the product you want to sell. That worldview alters the way they interpret everything you say and do. Frame your story in terms of the worldview, and itwill be heard.\\" (excerpted from page 60)     \\"People only notice stuff that's new and different. And the moment they notice something new, they start making guesses about what to expect next.\\" (excerpted from page 68)    \\"Humans are able to make extremely sophisticated judgments in a fraction of a second. And once they've drawn that conclusion, they resist changing it.\\" (excerpted from page 76)    \\"Stories let us lie to ourselves. And those lies satisfy our desires. It's the story, not the good or the service you actually sell, that pleases the customer.\\" (excerpted from page 84)    \\"The only stories that work, the only stories with impact, the only stories that spread are the `I can't believe that!' stories. These are the stories that aren't just repeated: these are the stories that demand to be repeated.\\" (excerpted from page 132)    For whom will this book be of greatest value? Good question. My own response is that those who are receptive to rigorous and coherent thinking which is unorthodox will be appreciative of it but only those who are both willing and able to MAKE HIS IDEAS WORK FOR THEM will derive any value from it. First, they must carefully consider the series of nine questions which Godin poses in the final section, \\"So, What to Do?\\" Next, they must re-read the book at least once and then formulate their own answers to those nine questions. Throughout that difficult but rewarding process, Godin suggests, they must \\"understand that the people with a worldview that gives them a bias to listen to you are the most valuable customers on earth. Get permission from them to follow up, then get to work finding new [or much improved] products for the people who want them.\\"           Those who have not already done so are strongly urged to read Godin's earlier works, notably Permission Marketing, Unleash the Ideavirus, Survival Is Not Enough, Purple Cow, and Free Prize Inside!	2005-05-23

Griffith's superb translation. For example: \\"All warfare is based on deception. Therefore, when capable, feign incapacity; when active, inactivity. When near, make it appear that you are far away; when far away, that you are near. Offer the enemy a bait to lure him; feign disorder and strike him. When he concentrates, prepare against him; where he is strong, avoid him. Pretend inferiority and encourage his arrogance. When he is united, divide him. Attack when he is unprepared; sally out when he does not expect you.\\" You get the idea.<br /><br />Jennings is a staunch and eloquent advocate of this principle: Do much more and do it much better, faster, and do it with less. OK, but how? The answer to that question was revealed by rigorous and extensive research which he and his two associates (Brian Solon and Greg Powell) conducted. They began with 70,000 companies as candidates for designation as the best performing companies in the U.S. Among all of them, which have increased their revenue and profits by at least 10% for ten years or longer? Only nine qualified: Cabela's, Dot Foods, Koch Industries, Medline Industries, O'Reilly Automotive, PETCO Animal Supplies, SAS Institute, Sonic Drive-in, and Strayer Education.<br /><br />Back to \\"How?\\" Jennings identifies ten \\"Building Blocks\\" which, in combination, explain why each of those in an obviously mixed bag of companies has been and continues to be a best performer (i.e. among the top one-hundredth of 1% of all U.S. companies). It would be a disservice to both Jennings and to those who read this brief commentary to list them and then comment on each out of the context within which Jennings so skillfully presents them. Suffice to say that all organizations (regardless of their size or nature) need to have all ten Building Blocks as a core foundation on which to increase their revenue and profits by at least 10% and then continue to do so year after year after year.<br /><br />How revealing that the CEOs whom Jennings and his research associates interviewed indicate little (if any) interest in any of Sun Tzu's deception strategies...nor in what their competitors are up to, for that matter. They seem wholly preoccupied with sticking to their own \\"knitting,\\" focusing on what their companies can do best, how to do it even better, and thereby deliver even greater value to their customers. Also, each seems determined to nourish and enhance the quality of life as well as standard of living of everyone involved in the enterprise. This is precisely what Jennings means when referring to building communities, Building Block #9. Employees, customers, and allies should be viewed as \\"partners\\" and treated as such.<br /><br />Ultimately, one of the most formidable challenges for those in any organization is to achieve and then maintain an appropriate balance of \\"thinking BIG\\" while \\"acting small.\\" Hence the importance of Section Three, \\"The Quad: A Self-Evaluation and Ranking,\\" in which Jennings \\"breaks down the title of the book into four scenarios, each represented by a quadrant\\":<br /><br />TSAS Think Small, Act Small<br />TSAB Think Small, Act Big<br />TBAB Think Big, Act Big<br />TBAS Think Big, Act Small<br /><br />He applies this template to each of the ten Building Blocks. It remains for each reader to complete the self-evaluation, one which helps to measure her or his own organization's current situation. The details of this exercise are best revealed within the text, pages 189-201.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for reasons previously indicated but also because I cannot recall a prior time since the Great Depression when it was more difficult for companies to increase their revenue and profits by at least 10% for ten years or longer. Consider these statistics which Michael Gerber shares in his recently published E-Myth Mastery: \\"Of the 1 million U.S. small businesses started this year [2005], more than 80% of them will be out of business within 5 years and 96% will have closed their doors before their 10th birthday.\\" Chilling statistics indeed. Here in a single volume is a rigorous analysis of how nine quite different companies have achieved and then sustained their \\"full economic and human potential.\\"<br /><br />How important and potentially valuable is this book?

Miller and Stephen E. Heiman with Tad Tuleja.<br /><br />I read the first edition of this book when it was published 18 years ago. Hence my curiosity about this edition. What's new? In fact, a great deal. Miller and Heiman have thoroughly revised the original material, \\"page by page, to tighten the prose, clarify explanations, and provide up-to-date examples from [current and recent] Miller Heiman clients.\\" For example, they have refined their explication of Concept and product (as indicated in Chapter 4) and expanded their discussions of Question Types while providing clarifications of two concepts which, apparently, often prove puzzling: Action Commitment and Valid Business Reason.<br /><br />They have also included discussion of Single Sales Objective in Chapter 5. (This concept was originally developed within the Strategic Selling program and is now a component of Conceptual Selling.) \\"Most dramatically, we have revised the entire sequence of the Conceptual Selling `modules'...Another new element is a question-and-answer epilogue where we address some of the interesting challenges which our clients have posed to us.\\"<br /><br />Miller and Heiman respond to 15 questions generated by their \\"continuing dialogue\\" with those who enroll in various Conceptual Selling workshops. For example:<br /><br />#1. Isn't Conceptual Selling just another name for consultative selling?<br /><br />A: \\"There are similarities, to be sure, but they're not the same.\\" Miller and Heiman pay due respect to Mark Hanan (author of another business bestseller, Consultative Selling) while explaining how his ideas -- which they greatly admire -- and theirs differ. See the complete response to this question pages 348-349.<br /><br />#6. Having a Valid Business Reason implies that you know something about the customer before you go in. How do you do that when you're making a cold call?<br /><br />A: \\"You're still making cold calls? The whole point of a Valid Business Reason is to render them unnecessary.\\" How so? See the complete response to this question on page 349.<br /><br />#14. Is Unique Strength another name for \\"competitive advantage\\"? And should I compare my company's Unique Strengths to those of the competition?<br /><br />A: \\"Not exactly.\\" Miller and Heiman briefly explain that, in economic theory, a \\"competitive advantage is a point of superiority that one company has over its competitors\\" whereas a \\"Unique Strength is much more specific than that: It's the contribution [italics] one company's solution can make make to [italics] one  customer in [one] area that the customer perceives as better than any competing solution.\\" See the complete response to this question on pages 361-362.<br /><br />NOTE: In Buyer-Approved Selling: Sales Secrets from the Buyer's Side of the Desk, Michael Schell also suggests all manner of strategies and tactics by which to formulate and then present what Miller and Heiman identify as a Unique Strength. Presumably they and Schell agree with Warren Buffett, however, who once suggested that cost is what we charge but value is what someone else thinks it's worth. Nothing is a Unique Strength (or whatever else you call it) unless so perceived by customers and, equally important, by prospective customers.<br /><br />Everyone in sales should have her or his own \\"toolkit.\\" Some of its contents are provided by the given employee, others are provided by formal training and/or a supervisor, and still others from a book such as this. Long ago, I realized that strategies are \\"hammers\\" and tactics are \\"nails.\\" The former drive the latter. That said, I presume to offer a caveat. Keep in mind this bromide: a camel is a horse designed by a committee.<br /><br />Obviously, it would be foolish to stuff a \\"toolkit\\" with everything offered by Miller and Heiman in combination with everything offered in other excellentbooks such the aforementioned Consultative Selling and Buyer-Approved Selling as well as Neil Rackham's SPIN Selling, Anthony Parinello's Selling To VITO (The Very Important Top Officer), Michael Bosworth's Solution Selling: Creating Buyers in Difficult Selling Markets and CustomerCentric Selling,and Keith M Eades's The New Solution Selling: The Revolutionary Sales Process That is Changing the Way People Sell.<br /><br />Presumably Miller and Heiman agree that readers of books such as theirs must be aware of everything available in what could be called \\"The Salesperson's Super Hardware Store.\\" The challenge is to select and then use effectively those tools which are most appropriate to the given marketplace.<br /><br />Given how attractively priced the most recently published paperback editions of The New Strategic Selling and The New Conceptual Selling are, I highly recommend both.

Here's the basic situation: Jensen contacted several hundred people and invited each to compose a letter to a loved one...or to several, perhaps children or grandchildren. BUZZ eventually generated several thousand submissions. (Mine was among them but not selected.) Jensen requested that each letter respond to a very basic but critically important question: \\"What would you tell your kids or your grandkids or dearest friends about what really matters at work?\\" Presumably the letters would share life lessons learned from poor choices made as well as greratest achievements, proudest moments, regrets, current concerns, hopes and dreams, etc. Everyone knew that her or his letter could perhaps eventually appear in print.<br /><br />Jensen carefully read and re-read all the letters received, eventually selecting 64 for inclusion in this book. He then organized them within five \\"Discovery\\" sections:<br /><br />1. Finding Yourself<br />2. Finding the Lessons to Be Learned, the Questions to Be Asked<br />3. Finding the Choices Which Really Matter<br />4. Finding the Courage to Choose<br />5. Finding Joy, Serenity, and Fulfillment<br /><br />Jensen is correct: \\"In their letters, we see ourselves\\" and \\"In their struggles, we see our own.\\"<br /><br />In his recently published Creating the Good Life, James O'Toole explains what we can learn about \\"getting it right\\" from a Greek philosopher, Aristotle, who lived almost 2,400 years ago. In one of the most interesting sections in his book,  O'Toole's discusses what he calls \\"The Deathbed Test\\": \\"Aristotle's test of true happiness is the degree to which one is free of deathbed regrets about his or her unfulfilled potential. He says that the realization at the end of one's days that 'I coulda, woulda, shoulda and mighta' is the definition of unhappiness. When Gandhi was in his forties and engaged in the practice of business law, he asked himself what he was likely to be able to say about his life at the end if he continued on his present course. He then decided to change his life and to realize his full potential.\\"<br /><br />O'Toole then explains that Aristotle offers \\"a useful set of questions that serve us as a self-assessment of whether our current actions and goals will ultimately lead to satisfaction with our life as a whole. The bottom line is that the time to start planning for a happy and fulfilling future is now, the perfect time to start asking 'what's next?' In my experience, Aristotle offers a lot more useful and practical advice than is found in most of the texts we assign in business school.\\"<br /><br />I thought about O'Toole's comments as I read this book. Both he and Jensen seem determined to help as many people as possible to ask the most important questions... and then answer them with honesty and courage. In his Introduction, Jensen points out that, according to more than 40 Gallup studies, about 75% of us feel disengaged from our jobs; according to the most recent U.S. Job Retention Survey, 75% of all employees are now searching for new employment opportunities; and according to the New American Dream Survey, about 83% of us wish we had more of what really matters in life. Obviously, a substantial majority of us (whatever the percentage) are experiencing a disconnect of some kind between what we are required to get done at work and what truly matters. Much of the material in this book indicates that.<br /><br />Noteworthy is the fact that so many of those who wrote these letters cite that disconnect. They share with the letters' recipients (and with those who read Jensen's book) what caused each disconnect in their lives, its nature and extent, its impact, and what they learned from it. Also noteworthy is how candid the letter-writers are. The thoughts and feelings seem (to me at least) authentic but seldom self-serving. For most of those whose letters are included, it was probably quite difficult to confront errors of judgments, betrayals of trust, behavior which was hurtful to others, etc. In a sense, they take the reader into their confidence. Yes, as with a person sitting next to them during a long-distance airline flight, there is a degree of \\"safety\\": the letter-writers and the reader will have no further contact. I still think it takes courage to acknowledge one's imperfections, especially insofar as they have negatively affected others. It takes even greater courage to allow themselves to be identified when the acknowledgments appear in print.<br /><br />For the most part, however, the letters in this book celebrate humanity (warts and all) while affirming that lessons can be learned from the experiences of others (no news there). What sets this book apart from any others I have read is that, almost immediately, I began to establish a rapport with the letter-writers, aided significantly by Jensen's narrative during which he helps to create an appropriate context without getting in the way. In the \\"Endnotes & Stats\\" section (pages 220-222), he shares the five most important lessons he has learned. This material is, for me, a personal letter from Jensen which he wisely includes at the end of his book.<br /><br />I do strongly disagree with his recommendation that his book not be read cover-to-cover. Some readers will. Others won't. So what? Just as each letter-writer describes a process of personal discovery, so must each reader embark on one of her or his own...reading the book as she or her wishes. Straight through. Hop around. Cherry pick. Lock in on one of the \\"Discoveries.\\" Whatever.<br /><br />Jensen has allowed himself to be described as a \\"practical simpleton, tough-love gadfly, passionate speaker, researcher, father, and friend.\\" No doubt he is all of that...and more.  In this instance, his primary function is to introduce several people who share the most important lessons they have learned. It remains for each reader to select those lessons which are most relevant to them...and then benefit from them in ways and to the extent appropriate to their own circumstances.<br /><br />Long ago, Voltaire suggested that we cherish those who seek the truth but beware of those who find it. Jensen and his 64 associates make no such claim. Their search continues...and so does ours, guided and informed by theirs.dence.

Miller and Stephen E. Heiman with Tad Tuleja.<br /><br />With Tuleja, Miller and Heiman offer a revised and updated edition of a book first published 20 years ago. Why? \\"The first [reason] is that our clients asked us to. Even though they found strategic Selling to be just as effective, and the concepts just as relevant, as they had been in 1985, some of them felt that...even the best processes could use a face-lift....The second reason we revised Strategic Selling [i.e. the book] relates to a basic axiom of the process itself: `Whatever got you where you are today is no longer sufficient to keep you there.\\" And even if it did, I presume to add, it is almost certainly not sufficient to get you where you want to go.<br /><br />Miller, Heiman, and their associates examined the original and subsequently revised material (1998) with \\"a fine-tooth comb, sharpening and enhancing it line-by-line.\\" The results of those labors are impressive, especially given the new discussions of various strategy concepts such as Degree of Influence (also known as Circle of Influence); the Win-Win Statement (rigorously examined in Chapter 10); Competition (covered in an entirely new chapter in Part 2, Chapter 13; and The \\"Refined Sales Funnel,\\" a time and territory management tool which is most effective when carefully coordinated with another tool, the Ideal Customer Profile. In this edition, Miller and Heiman reverse the order: \\"Focusing on Your Ideal Customer \\"(Part 4, Chapters 14 and 15) followed by \\"Managing Your Selling Time\\" (Part 5, Chapters 16-18).<br /><br />Of special interest to me is the final section, \\"After Twenty Years: Responding to Our Clients' Most Challenging Questions,\\" to which Miller and Heiman respond. 15. Yes, the questions are indeed \\"challenging\\" -- questions which everyone at least directly involved in sales should be asking of themselves on a regular basis -- but the greater value of this section is derived from what Miller and Heiman have so say. Their comments are directly responsive, offered with a conversational (as opposed to a professorial) tone. When appropriate, they duly acknowledge the complexities and ambiguities in a given situation. And throughout their responses, they make a sincere and generally effective effort to \\"level\\" with their reader. For example:<br /><br />14. \\"The Surefire Close. When all is said and done, you still have to close. Do you have any reliable closing techniques for helping us to improve our hit ratio?\\"<br /><br />A: \\"In a word: No.\\" Why? See the complete response on pages 422-423.<br /><br />15. \\"The Secret of Success. We're often told that the salesperson's single most important quality is persistence. What do you think about this?\\"<br /><br />A: \\"Persistence is an admirable quality, but it won't get you anywhere unless the people you are persistent with believe in you and are absolutely convinced that they can trust you....The one quality that every great salesperson has got to have is not persistence but credibility.\\" Why? See the complete response on pages 423-424.<br /><br />Granted, these brief examples are taken out of context, in terms both of the section from which they are excerpted and the book within which that section serves as a conclusion. Nonetheless, I hope they give at least some indication of why a revised and updated edition was needed.<br /><br />Everyone in sales should have her or his own \\"toolkit.\\" Some of its contents are provided by the given employee, others are provided by formal training and/or a supervisor, and still others from a book such as this.

In this brilliant book, they explain how to understand the power and limits of mental models; how to test the relevance of mental models against a changing environment, generate new models, and develop a \\"portfolio\\" of models; how to overcome inhibitors to change by reshaping infrastructure and the thinking of others; and finally, how to transform one's world by acting quickly upon the new models, continuously experimenting and applying a process by which to assess and then strengthen one's mental models. Long ago, Henry Ford observed: \\"Whether you think you can or think you can`t, you're right.\\" I agree with Ford to an extent: Self-fulfilling prophecies are almost always based on a positive or negative attitude. Nonetheless, I am wrong if I think that I can defeat Tiger Woods in match play competition. Wind and Crook would insist, however, that with the proper mental model and lots of hard work, I could eventually become a much better golfer than I would otherwise be.<br /><br />They organize the material in this book as follows:<br /><br />Part 1: Recognize [and Understand] the Power and Limit of Mental Models<br />Part 2: Keeping Your Mental Models Relevant<br />Part 3: Transform Your World<br />Part 4: Act Quickly and Effectively<br />Conclusion: What You Think Is What You Do<br /><br />In the Appendix (The Neuroscience Behind Mental Models), one of the core concepts is that \\"reality is a story the brain and the world work out together.\\" This is a variation on Lilly Tomlin's suggestion that reality is a \\"collective hunch.\\" Wind and Crook are describing an on-going process which has four primary phases, each of which is examined in in one of the four Parts. The process is on-going in that, once the power and the limit(s) of mental models are fully understood, it is still necessary to ensure that one's own mental models remain relevant during efforts \\"dismantle the old order\\" while finding common ground \\"to bridge adaptive disconnects.\\"<br /><br />At every appropriate opportunity, as Wind and Crook carefully explain, it is imperative to be able to respond quickly and effectively. In Chapter 10, they discuss intuition and explain how to develop and enhance its capabilities. (Pages 181-186) Their discussion of \\"creative leaps\\" reminds me of much of what Malcolm Gladwell has to say about intuition in Blink. If I understand all this (and I may not), Wind and Crook seem to agree with Gladwell that underdeveloped intuition is (at best) a \\"lucky hunch\\" whereas developed intuition enables us to utilize talent, training, and (most important of all) experience to make appropriate decisions when we suddenly find ourselves in a life-threatening situation and must react.<br /><br />In Chapter 11, Wind and Cook explain how three celebrity CEOs demonstrate in their respective lives and careers \\"the power of impossible thinking.\\" Howard Schultz formulated new concepts of coffee as a beverage and caf&eacute; as a social environment within which to consume it. Under his leadership, Starbucks continues with rigorous experimentation which challenges its business model (based on Schultz's mental models), constantly trying to \\"stretch beyond the possible.\\" The Oprah Winfrey Show is a prime example of \\"impossible thinking\\" in that Winfrey formulated a new mental model: She would interact with her audience as personal friends. The dialog was deliberately self-revealing as she discussed her own challenges and experiences, especially those which were personally unpleasant, at times deeply hurtful. \\"She adopted a goal to `transform people's lives.' She changed the ways people thought about talk shows and about their own lives -- in effect, challenging their mental models.\\" With regard to Andy Grove, former chairman and CEO of Intel, he led and managed a huge global enterprise by preparing it for what he characterized as strategic inflection points: each reveals \\"a mental map of the New World.\\"<br /><br />As Wind and Crook explain, all three recognized the influence of childhood, education, and early work in shaping their mental models; kept their models relevant; made things happen by transforming the world around them; and acted quickly and effectively.<br /><br />I appreciate the Conclusion section in which Wind and Crook reiterate their key points. Here are three:<br /><br />1. \\"When you face a new decision or new challenge, step back a moment and consider whether or not you have the right model for it.\\"<br /><br />2. \\"To carry your new view into the world, pay attention to the factors that keep you locked in the old model or enable you to bring others into the world.\\"<br /><br />3. \\"If you can cultivate the ability to think in new directions, you have the possibility to transform the business of your life and the life of your business. There are so many opportunities for transformation if you could only see them. To see these opportunities and to seize them, you need the courage and the understanding to think impossible thoughts -- and then act upon them.\\"<br /><br />In response to these three points, presumably Henry Ford would suggest, \\"Whether you think you can or think you can't gain the power of impossible thinking, you're right.\\" Wind and Crook disagree. Although the Model T was indeed a product of Ford's \\"impossible thinking\\" in 1908, newer and better mental models have produced newer and better automobiles each year since. In all other industries, newer and better mental models continue to produce newer and better whatevers. My hope is that, after absorbing and digesting the material in this book, many readers will then begin some impossible thinking about the business of their lives and the life of their businesses. They are strongly encouraged to take full advantage of the CD-ROM which accompanies the book.

I appreciate the Conclusion section in which Wind and Crook reiterate their key points. Here are three:    1. \\"When you face a new decision or new challenge, step back a moment and consider whether or not you have the right model for it.\\"     2. \\"To carry your new view into the world, pay attention to the factors that keep you locked in the old model or enable you to bring others into the world.\\"     3. \\"If you can cultivate the ability to think in new directions, you have the possibility to transform the business of your life and the life of your business. There are so many opportunities for transformation if you could only see them. To see these opportunities and to seize them, you need the courage and the understanding to think impossible thoughts -- and then act upon them.\\"    In response to these three points, presumably Henry Ford would suggest, \\"Whether you think you can or think you can't gain the power of impossible thinking, you're right.\\" Wind and Crook disagree. Although the Model T was indeed a product of Ford's \\"impossible thinking\\" in 1908, newer and better mental models have produced newer and better automobiles each year since. In all other industries, newer and better mental models continue to produce newer and better whatevers. My hope is that, after absorbing and digesting the material in this book, many readers will then begin some impossible thinking about the business of their lives and the life of their businesses. They are strongly encouraged to take full advantage of the CD-ROM which accompanies the book. It consists of an audio summary and an interview with the authors.    And perhaps more intellectually adventuresome readers will also do some impossible thinking about impossible thinking...then share it with Yoram (Jerry) Wind and Colin Crook.	2005-04-21

To your surprise and delight, he responds...inviting you to spend a long weekend with him on Nantucket, during which you will have his undivided attention. He anticipates almost all of your questions and has carefully prepared to answer them, fully and honestly. What we have in this volume is probably what Welch would share with you if given the opportunity.<br /><br />How best to describe Winning? It is not an autobiography. It offers memoirs but only  to the extent Welch draws upon his life and career to establish a context within which to pose a question, offer an example, make a key point, etc. Unlike so many other business books allegedly written by celebrity CEOs (but which were in fact primarily crafted by ghostwriters), this book is a refreshing exception. There is no doubt in my mind that Welch wrote it. Of course, along the way, he would have been a fool not to have obtained feedback from his wife, Suzy, given her own distinguished career. She is widely renowned for her talents, both as an editor and as a business thinker in her own right. But this is definitely Welch's book.<br /><br />Much of what Winning offers is, of course, relevant to business but its greater value, for me, is derived from the personal relationship which Welch immediately establishes and then sustains with his reader. Oh sure, he shares generously of what he learned during a 40-year association with G.E. Those reminiscences are both informative and entertaining. However, as Welch points out, he learned almost as much about business after he retired as CEO as he did when he worked there. Since then, \\"I have been asked literally thousands of questions. But most of them come down to this: [begin italics] What does it take to win?\\" [end italics] His thoughtful and eloquent response to that question gives form and direction to this book.<br /><br />To his credit, Welch never hesitates to acknowledge his poor decisions, his deficiencies as a corporate leader and manager, and his disappointments during what has been an otherwise extraordinarily successful business career. What also comes through loud and clear are his obsession with achieving superior performance (especially his own), his delight in taking on formidable challenges, his passion for \\"winning,\\" whatever the competition may be, and his appreciation of each new day as well as the new opportunities which it offers. Also obvious is that he possesses what Hemingway once described as a \\"built-in, shock-proof crap detector.\\"<br /><br />What a privilege and pleasure it would be to spend that hypothetical long weekend with Welch. Presumably those who have done so would agree that reading this book gives at least some indication of what would be revealed during a series of one-on-one conversations with him. I disagree with Warren Buffett's claim that \\"No other management book will ever be needed.\\" (Will all due respect to his friend, perhaps Welch also does.) However, I think Winning offers a wealth of sound, practical, at times unorthodox advice about leadership and management. For executives who aspire to be \\"winners,\\" this is a must read.<br /><br />I also highly recommend the unabridged audio set (11 hours on 9 CDs) during which Welch reads from this book.

White's The Making of the President, 1960. Since then, I have read dozens of other books about that and subsequent campaigns as well as countless studies of those who have served as President. That said, I consider Mears's Deadlines Past among the most informative as well as most entertaining. In it, he examines his 40-year career as a reporter who rose within the ranks of the Associated Press organization, eventually serving as the AP's bureau chief in Washington. He retired after the inauguration of George W. Bush in 2001. Of special significance to me is that he had a unique advantage over almost everyone else assigned to cover the White House and its most important occupant: Unlike  counterparts from individual newspapers as well as radio and television networks, Mears represented a service organization which distributed reports to its subscribers throughout the world. As a result, the nature and extent of his access to the Oval Office were greater than almost any other journalist's. Here is a representative sample of what he observed and, more importantly, what he thought about a given politician, issue, or event.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes politicians do lie and misbehave, although probably no more often than people in business or lawyers or, for that matter, journalists. But most of the politicians I covered ran for office because they thoughts they could achieve change for the better, not purely for power and surely not for money, although wealth came to some of them because they held or had held office. That's not to say that they did not relish power. Power translates into the ability to do what a candidate believes should be done, and politicians are an ego-driven lot, out to sell themselves on the public stage in ways that would embarrass most of us.\\" (page 25)<br /><br />In 1976, \\"...the improbable Democrat [Carter] beat the unelected Republican [Ford], but only narrowly. It was not surprising that Ford lost the 1976 election. That he came close to winning it was a political miracle for a humdrum Republican who had never run in an election outside of his Michigan congressional district, who came to the presidency because of his own party's scandal, and worsened his situation by Pardoning Nixon for Watergate crimes.\\" (page 127)<br /><br />\\"There had been rumblings from [Quayle's] detractors about dumping him in 1992, but Bush decreed long in advance that Quayle would absolutely be on his ticket. He'd produced a dossier of gaffes as vice president. I thought he peaked with his contorted attempt to recite the slogan of the United Negro College Fund. `What a waste it is to lose one's mind or not to have a mind, is being wasteful. How true it is.\\" Yes, a mind is indeed a terrible thing to waste. His most convoluted sentences not withstanding, Quayle was no dummy. To borrow the line used against him in that 1988 debate: I knew Dan Quayle, Dan Quayle was a friend of mine. I thought he was a competent man and a competent senator who would have been better off had he stayed in the senate. He was better than his reputation and his worst lines, but in over his head as vice president.\\" (pages 271-272)<br /><br />\\"I had been writing columns for the AP for twelve years and I had one to go. I interviewed the first President-elect Bush for my first column in 1989 and the second President-elect Bush for my last in 2001. I asked each of them as he began what he would want said of him after his time in the White House. `I want to give it my best shot,' the elder Bush had said on the eve of his inauguration. `The presidency is still the place from which to lead and from which to effect change, hopefully for the better.' Same topic, new president. `I hope people will be able to say he was steady under fire, he was wise enough to listen to counsel and decisive enough to make a decision that made a positive difference,' George W. told me.<br /><br />\\"With that final story it was time for me to go. I'd had a front row seat on national politics for forty years. It was exhilarating, exhausting, satisfying, tense, frustrating, and fun -- my ticket to see, hear, and write about winners and losers, flaws and failings, in the imperfect way of nominating and electing presidents.\\"<br /><br />There are literally several hundred other passages in this book from which I could also have selected a representative sample. Mears does everything possible to share with his reader the \\"front row seat\\" to which he refers. His intelligence and energy are soon obvious. Also his discretion and circumspection when sharing his own opinions about the \\"winners and losers, flaws and failings, in the imperfect way of nominating and electing presidents.\\" Throughout this volume, especially after he had gained extensive experience covering the White House, he also indicates that he possessed what Hemingway once referred to as \\"a built-in, shock-proof crap detector.\\"<br /><br />For those who share my keen interest in presidential campaigns and, especially, in the key individuals involved with them, this is a \\"must read.\\" I also highly recommend Hendrik Hertzberg's Politics: Observations & Arguments, 1966-2004, David C.

(Yoda)	Schell and his associates have completed extensive research among decision-makers who buy products or hire talent. The books he has authored are based on that research and share a few core concepts:<br /><br />1. Determine HOW you can help a given organization to prosper.<br /><br />2. Learn everything you need to know inorder to propose an appropriate course of action.<br /><br />3. Collaborate with the decision-maker(s) on finalizing the details of that course of action.<br /><br />4. Then implement it with meticulous care as well as with energy and enthusiasm, making whatever revisions may become necessary.<br /><br />In this volume, Schell offers a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system by which to apply these core concepts for opportunities which small businesses have. (By the way, the same core concepts are also appropriate to larger organizations, but let's limit our attention to those which have limited resources, those for whom Schell primarily wrote this book.) It may be of interest to take a moment and consider a few statistics: Of the 1 million U.S. small businesses started this year [2005], more than 80% of them will be out of business within 5 years and 96% will have closed their doors before their 10th birthday. These are indeed chilling statistics. That's the bad news.<br /><br />Now some good news which is indicated as Jack Welch explains why he admires small companies: \\"For one, they communicate better. Without the din and prattle of bureaucracy, people listen as well as talk; and since there are fewer of them they generally know and understand each other. Second, small companies move faster. They know the penalties for hesitation in the marketplace. Third, in small companies, with fewer layers and less camouflage, the leaders show up very clearly on the screen. Their performance and its impact are clear to everyone. And, finally, smaller companies waste less. They spend less time in endless reviews and approvals and politics and paper drills. They have fewer people; therefore they can only do the important things. Their people are free to direct their energy and attention toward the marketplace rather than fighting bureaucracy.\\"<br /><br />In this volume, Schell offers 53 \\"Secrets\\" and organizes his explication of them as follows:<br /><br />Part I:  Foundation (Secrets 1-7)<br />Part II:  Developing New Business (Secrets 8-32)<br />Part III:  Tying It All Together (Secrets 33-53)<br /><br />In fact, few of these so-called \\"secrets\\" will be a revelation to anyone with even limited business experience. Each makes compelling sense and most seem to me to be obvious. For example, \\"Keep only the right people on your team\\" (#4), \\"Get Your prospect database in order\\" (#8), \\"Be ready for tough questions from your prospects\\" (#21), \\"Keep your employees informed\\" (#46), and \\"Negotiate effectively\\" (#49). Well, duh.<br /><br />The substantial value of this book is derived, rather, from carefully reading and then re-reading the material first; then completing what I would call a \\"gut check\\" to determine (a) the extent to which your organization is already doing what Schell recommends, (b) how effectively that is being done, (c) what else needs to be done,  when, how, and by whom, and finally (d) how progress will be accurately measured per tasks, division of labor, and deadlines.<br /><br />Everyone within your organization who will be involved in these initiatives should have read and (preferably) re-read this book before meeting together to conduct the \\"gut check\\" and then collaborate on an appropriate course of action. It is also imperative that they see customers as partners in the enterprise, and, see themselves as partners with each prospective customer. At every stage of the collaborate process, think in terms of both cultivation and solicitation. Trust and respect must first be earned before permission is requested. That is as true of and as important as relationships with associates as it is of relationships with customers. And don't forget about those who comprise your list of payables recipients. All third-party centers of influence can -- and should -- should be viewed and engaged (once they agree to be) as an extended sales force.<br /><br />Schell shares within his Final Thoughts the following:<br /><br />There are three kinds of people in the world:<br />Those who make it happen,<br />Those who watch it happen,<br />And those who ask, \\"Hey, what happened?\\"<br /><br />Recall the aforementioned \\"chilling statistics: Of the 1 million U.S. small businesses started this year [2005], more than 80% of them will be out of business within 5 years and 96% will have closed their doors before their 10th birthday.

Perhaps you're now asking the same question I once did: \\"Given the fact that he lived almost 2,400 years ago, what could Aristotle possibly have to say that is directly relevant to me?\\" In fact, a great deal. So many of us today -- especially those at mid-life -- are engaged in a search to find meaning and happiness. We often ask, as Peggy Lee once did, \\"Is that all there is?\\" The purpose of this book is show how Aristotle is an effective guide on that search, and how he can help each of us find our own practical answer to a critically important question, \\"What's next?\\"<br /><br />In an interview to appear in the July/August (2005) issue of Chamber Executive magazine, O'Toole observes that \\"Aristotle was the most practical of all great philosophers. His audience was the business and political leadership of his day. He offered them wisdom they could apply in their own lives -- practical advice on matters ranging from ethical business practices to effective philanthropy. Aristotle even describes 'virtuous non-retirement' -- the lifelong commitment to engage in leisure work which is characterized by pursuit of the 'highest good' of individual excellence and the 'complete good' of community service. He offers practical tests to help us determine how much wealth we need to support us while we engage in those activities.\\"<br /><br />O'Toole goes on to say, \\"So my challenge was not making Aristotle relevant to today's successful professionals and managers; instead, I faced the nearly impossible task of making his difficult language clear to modern readers [begin italics] without dumbing it down [end italics]. I had to find a way to explore the depth and complexity of Aristotle in a way that makes sense in an age of sound bites and blogs. After all, who ever heard of a [begin italics] serious [end italics] self-help book?  But that's what I set out to write.\\"<br /><br />As O'Toole explains in this book, Aristotle struggled with many of the same difficult circumstances (more than two centuries ago) which most of us face in 2005: \\"...in his career as a teacher and a consultant to leaders of ancient Athens, Aristotle thought long and hard about what it means to live a good life and how much it takes to finance it. His thoughts on this matter are particularly applicable today, given the baby boom generation's anxiety over insufficient retirement savings and shaky investments: Aristotle shows how we can find happiness at almost any level of income. Moreover, he argues that the ability to find true contentment correlates only tangentially with the amount of money one has cached away. Unlike so many of today's `life advisors,' Aristotle integrates financial planning with the broader task of life planning.\\"<br /><br />Throughout human history, there has been a constant challenge to get lifestyle and quality of life in appropriate balance. As O'Toole notes, \\"Aristotelian ethics concern moral decisions related to how we should allocate the limited time of our lives. We must each plan how we will allocate our energies among such activities as earning, learning, playing, being with friends and family, and participating in the community. As we make these choices, Aristotle warns, we will fail to achieve 'the chief good' -- that is, we will fail to be happy -- if we pursue the wrong ends.\\"<br /><br />If the pursuit of philosophy is to serve as a practical guide to action, and I believe it is, then the wisdom which Aristotle gained from his own experiences will guide and inform our own pursuit and achievement of \\"the chief good\\": personal happiness. In the Foreword to one of O'Toole's previously published books, The Executive's Compass, Lodwrick M. Cook (former chairman and CEO of Atlantic Richfield Company) explains O'Toole's use of the central metaphor: \\"The beauty of the compass is that it provides a framework for the executive to create order out of the growing chaos of cultural diversity and conflict of values. Like a real compass, [O'Toole's 'value compass'] helps us to find where we are, where others are, where we want to go, and how to get there. Like the Aspen experience itself, O'Toole's compass is aimed at developing executive judgment by expanding our understanding of the interrelationships of fundamental values.\\"<br /><br />Cook's comments are also relevant to Creating the Good Life. For those now struggling to define and then create the good life for themselves, whatever their current circumstances may be, Aristotle's wisdom can indeed serve as a \\"compass.\\" In this volume, O'Toole prepares his reader to use it effectively.re we are, where others are, where we want to go, and how to get there.

I strongly recommend all of the volumes in the series. The individual titles are listed at this Web site: [...] The authors of various articles are among the world's most highly regarding experts on the given subject. Each volume has been carefully edited. Supplementary commentaries are also provided in most of the volumes, as is an \\"About the Contributors\\" section which usually includes suggestions of other sources which some readers may wish to explore. In this volume, the reader is provided with eight articles. Here is a selection of brief excerpts from the executive summaries with precede each of three:<br /><br />\\"....managers need to understand that creativity has three parts: expertise, the ability to think flexibly and imaginatively, and motivation. Managers can influence the first two, but doing so is costly and slow. It would be far more effective to increase employees' intrinsic motivation....To that end, managers have five levers to pull: the amount of challenge they give employees, the degree of freedom they grant around process, the way they design work groups, the level of encouragement they give, and the nature of the organizational support.\\" (Introducing Teresa M. Amabile's \\"How to Kill Creativity\\")<br /><br />\\"Some innovations spring from a flash of genius [but] most result from a conscious, purposeful search for opportunities. For managers seeking innovation, engaging in disciplined work is more important than having an entrepreneurial personality....[According to Drucker, the major sources of opportunities include] unexpected occurrences, incongruities of various kinds, process needs, or changes in an industry or market,...demographic changes, changes in perception, or new knowledge.\\" (Introducing Peter F. Drucker's \\"The Discipline of Innovation\\")<br /><br />\\"[Having studied more than 30 of the largest international corporations, Kim and Mauborgne found that]....the difference between the high growth companies and their less successful competitors was in each group's assumptions about strategy....Managers of the high-growth companies followed what [Kim and Mauborgne] call the logic of value innovation....Many companies let competitors set the parameters of of their strategic thinking; value innovators do not use rivals as benchmarks. Rather than focus on the differences among customers, value innovators look for what customers value in common. Rather than view opportunities through the lens of existing assets and capabilities, value innovators ask, What if we start anew?\\" (Introducing W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne's \\"Value Innovation: The Strategic Logic of High Growth\\")<br /><br />In the other five articles, Dorothy Leonard and Jeffrey F. Rayport explain how to spark innovation through what they call \\"empathetic design\\"; Leonard and Susaan Straus explain how to \\"put your company's whole brain to work\\"; Eileen Morley and Andrew Silver propose taking what they call \\"a film director's approach\\" to managing creativity; in a case study, Suzy Wetlaufer examines what is stifling creativity at CoolBurst, a fictitious Miami-based fruit juice company; and Richard K. Lester, Michael J. Piore, and Kamal M. Malek introduce their concept of \\"interpretative management,\\" explaining what general managers can learn from design.<br /><br />Granted, because several of these articles were published years ago, some of the material in this volume is understandably somewhat dated but the core concepts are solid and remain relevant to all organizations, regardless of size or nature.

This is one in a series of several dozen volumes which comprise the \\"Harvard Business Review Paperback Series.\\" Each offers direct, convenient, and inexpensive access to the best thinking on the given subject in articles originally published by the Harvard Business School Review. I strongly recommend all of the volumes in the series. The individual titles are listed at this Web site: [...] The authors of various articles are among the world's most highly regarding experts on the given subject. Each volume has been carefully edited. Supplementary commentaries are also provided in most of the volumes, as is an \\"About the Contributors\\" section which usually includes suggestions of other sources which some readers may wish to explore.<br /><br />In this volume, we are provided with eight articles, in each of which the focus is on a specific aspect of innovation. For example, the first was co-authored by W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne. They explain how to create new market space. The core concepts were later developed in much greater depth (no pun intended) in their book, Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make Competition Irrelevant. They are also the co-authors of a second article in this HBR anthology, \\"Knowing a Winning Business Idea When You See One.\\" They offer three \\"tools\\": the buyer utility map (how attractive a new business idea will likely be), the price corridor of the mass (identifying a price which will unlock the greatest number of buyers), and the business tool model guide (a framework for determining whether and how a company can profitably deliver the new idea at the targeted price). Authors and co-authors of the other six articles explain how creative breakthroughs were achieved at 3M, how to build an innovation \\"factory,\\" how to meet the challenge of disruptive change, how to discover points of differentiation, how to use the social sector as a beta site for business innovation, and finally, how and why \\"enlightened experimentation\\" offers the new imperative for innovation.<br /><br />As a long-time subscriber to the Harvard Business Review, I am always curious to see which of the articles it publishes lead to books such as Kim and Mauborgne's Blue Ocean Strategy. With Michael Overdorf, Clayton M. Christensen wrote \\"Meeting the Challenge of Disruptive Change.\\" Its core concept is explored in The Innovator's Dilemma, The Innovator's Solution, and most recently in Seeing What's Next: Using Theories of Innovation to Predict Industry Change, a current bestseller which Christensen co-authored with Erik A. Roth and Scott D. Anthony.<br /><br />I highly recommend all of the various volumes which comprise the \\"Harvard Business Review Paperback Series.\\" Every executive should own and frequently consult those which are most relevant, indeed essential to her or his own professional development. Years ago, then president of Harvard Derek Bok observed, \\"If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.\\" The wisdom of that observation is especially true of attractively priced paperbacks such as this one.<br /><br />My only regret is that Teresa M. Amabile's \\"How to Kill Creativity\\" was not included. However, fortunately, it is the lead article in a companion volume, Harvard Business Review on Breakthrough Thinking. For those who wish to explore her work in much greater depth, I strongly recommend Creativity in Context: Update to the Social Psychology of Creativity.erimentation\\" offers the new imperative for innovation. <br /> <br />As a long-time subscriber to the Harvard Business Review, I am always curious to see which of the articles it publishes lead to books such as Kim and Mauborgne's Blue Ocean Strategy.

However, what we have here is a much sharper focus on two of the three objectives specified in the subtitle: close the value gap and increase margins while winning the complex sale. In the Foreword, Greg Lewin does a skillful job of explaining the need for this sequel, offering his own conclusions about customer value: \\"[begin italics] First, value should be added to the customer's entire business, not just a specific part of it...Second, the value created for your customer should be easily identified and owned by your customer...Third -- and this is the main objective of Thull's Prime Solution -- the value you promise must be delivered...Fourth, the `secret sauce' is the heart and soul of your organization -- the people! [end italics]\\" According to Thull, Prime Solutions deliver optimal results which leverage value to the highest level of each customer's business, ensure that customers are provided with the best answer to the given problem, and provide solution implementation and value-enhancement strategies that enable customers to achieve the ROI that they anticipated.<br /><br />Presumably Thull agrees with me that getting beyond customer satisfaction and even loyalty to what is widely referred to as \\"customer evangelism\\" requires that what he calls \\"robust solutions\\" must be provided consistently, time and again, whatever questions must be answered, whatever problems must be solved. To sustain that relationship, therefore, Thull recommends three separate but interdependent protocols: value maximization of product, process, and performance; decision acuity which enables customers to recognize -- and thereby appreciate -- the tangible benefits of the solution(s) provided; and optimization of a measurable ROI. I agree with Thull that what he calls the Prime Solution Cycle (please see pages 179-194) requires a cross-functional effort; that is, communication, cooperation, and collaboration between and among all areas within the provider's organization.<br /><br />In Part I, Thull explores the environment in which complex solutions must compete. Then in Part II, he shifts his attention to an analysis of how to translate the demands of that environment into the three protocols which define, guide, and inform prime solutions. Finally, in Part III, Thull responds to a question which each reader is probably asking as she or he arrives at page 125: \\"How can my organization develop and then deliver prime solutions to our own customers?\\" Four chapters are devoted to Thull's response. First, he recommends a process of discovery and engagement which will reveal opportunities among those prospects currently experiencing insufficiency of the value offered. Next, diagnose and quantify what is needed. Then, design and produce what will fill (solve) the given need. Finally, deliver, measure, and improve on the solution(s) In this context, I am reminded of Neil Rackham's acronym, SPIN, which suggests the nature and sequence of diagnostic questions to be asked to determine the Situation; Problem(s) to be solved; Implications (i.e. benefits of solution or negative consequences of non-solution); and Need fulfillment, immediate and on-going). Actually, once having carefully explained the diagnostic phase, Thull goes far beyond it. After the determination of need(s), HOW to design and produce a \\"robust\\" solution with cross-functional communication, cooperation, and collaboration? How to market it? How to deliver it? And then, how to ensure that the given customer derives maximum ROI...and knows it? Thull's answers to these questions will guide and inform his reader<br /><br />When concluding this brief commentary as I have with others, I now presume to offer caveats. First, beware of what Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert I. Sutton characterize as \\"The Knowing-Doing Gap\\" in the book which bears thattitle. More often than not, decision-makers fail to convert knowledge into action to achieve the desired results. In this context, I am reminded of Coach Darrell Royal's assertion that \\"potential\\" means \\"you ain't done it yet.\\" By all means absorb and digest the information and counsel which Thull provides in abundance. You and your associates must then focus together on formulating and then providing what each customer needs. Also, when seeking buy-in within your organization, expect to encounter resistance to change initiatives. For example, resistance which Jim O'Toole characterizes in his book, Leading Change, as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" If I understand Thull correctly (and I may not), he urges his reader to think in terms of cross-functional teamwork which involves customers as well as everyone within the provider's organization. Granted, that is an ambitious objective but I wholly agree with him that it is also an \\"achievable reality.\\"ars that title.

More than 60 years ago (December 13-22, 1944), what is generally referred to as \\"The Battle of the Bulge\\" was fought and won by Allied forces. In the Foreword to this book, retired General Frank T. Mildren (former Commander, 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division) points out that Cavanagh focuses primarily on a five-day critical battle for the north shoulder of the Bulge at Rocherath-Krinkelt. \\"Of course, the Bulge was fought in many areas, but it was won for the [U.S.] First Army on this shoulder.\\" It is important to keep in mind that Hitler committed some of his best troops to achieving victory (i.e. four powerful Panzer divisions and five infantry divisions) by attacking through Losheim, proceeding across the Elsenborn Ridge, and then continuing on to Antwerp. The key to the U.S. Army's success was its denial of the main efforts of the Sixth Panzer Army.<br /><br />Cavanagh's research was completed over several decades and included extensive interviews of German as well as U.S. participants. He seems to have located and utilized every possible source of factual information. I also appreciate the inclusion of so many archival photographs. Of greatest interest to me, however, is Cavanagh's rigorous and eloquent discussion of those who are sometimes referred to as \\"grunts.\\" In this context, I am reminded of The Face of Battle in which John Keegan examines comparable warriors who fought in three other major battles: Agincourt (October 25, 1415), Waterloo (June 18, 1815), and the Somme (July 1, 1916). With due respect to celebrated military leaders such as General George S. Patton, Cavanagh celebrates the courage, stamina, determination, self-sacrifice, and heroism of the troops under their command.<br /><br />Having read this book, I fully understand why General Courtney H. Hodges (Commanding General of the First U.S. Army) asserted that \\"What the Second Infantry Division has done in the last four days will live forever in the history of the United States Army.\\"es Army.\\"	2005-03-31

Employees who experience democracy are more engaged.<br />2. Democratic enterprises create win-win situations.<br />3. Democratic enterprises are more just and fair.<br />4. Democratic enterprises are more agile.<br />5. Democratic enterprises are more able to integrate.<br /><br />It is no coincidence that when Fortune magazine publishes its annual lists of the most admired, best to work for, and most profitable corporations, respectively, several names appear on all three and others appear on at least two. To varying degrees, all are (by Gratton's definition) democratic enterprises.<br /><br />At this point, I feel obliged to reassure those who read my brief commentary that this book is mercifully free of esoteric theories, hypotheses, etc. which so frequently descend from various ivory towers like leaflets. She devotes all of the first chapter to what she calls \\"Citizens' Tales.\\" She introduces her reader to three corporate executives -- Greg Grimshaw (BP), Nina Bhatia (McKinsey), and Stewart Kearney (BT) -- and carefully explains how why each is important to her/his company, what each has done to be the best he/she could be, and what her/his company has done to sup[port those efforts. Citing reasons such as those listed earlier is easy. Validating and verifying them in the careers of three people is infinitely more difficult and Gratton succeeds brilliantly.<br /><br />Grimshaw, Bhatia, and Kearney are representative in that they \\"reflect the choices and dilemmas faced in day-to-day working lives...By observing them and the companies in which they work we are witnesses to the ebbs and flows of the contemporary enterprise...[They are] citizens rather than employees [because] they are adopting some of the conditions of citizenship and all are members of companies adopting some of the tenets of democracy.\\" According to Gratton, it is in the best interests of institutions and organizations to serve the best interests of their \\"citizens.\\" Why? First, by encouraging individuals to become autonomous and agile, they will themselves become more agile. Next, if they are committed and purposeful, their people will be committed and purposeful. Finally, the tenets of democracy (discussed in depth, pages 33-42) create an appropriate platform to integrate diverse business initiatives.<br /><br />In Chapter Two, Gratton briefly examines various forms of democracy (classical, liberal, direct, competitive/elitist, and legal) and the aforementioned tenets of democracy. Then in the following chapters (Three through Eight), she discusses \\"The Democratic Study\\" (which explores the six tenets in greater depth), \\"The Drivers to Democracy\\" (e.g. shifts in individuals and in technology), \\"Building Individual Autonomy\\" (i.e. how both individuals and organizations can become autonomous), \\"Crafting Organizational Variety\\" (real-world examples provided by BP, McKinsey, SONY, Unisys, Goldman Sachs), AstraZeneca, and BT), \\"Shaping Shared Purpose\\" (i.e. dimensions of accountability, obligation, trust, and power), and \\"Leaders and Citizens at Work\\" (e.g. the roles of the leader as philosopher and visionary and the roles of the team leader as creator of space and goal setter). In a single volume, Gratton has achieved a stunning application of fundamental principles of democracy (most of which were formulated in ancient Greece) to business issues, challenges, and opportunities in the 21st century. Obviously, it remains for each reader to determine the nature and extent of relevance of the material to the needs of her or his own organization.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for Gratton's book are urged to check out Jim O'Toole's  The Executive's Compass: Businessand the Good Society  and his most recent book, Creating the Good Life: Aristotle's Guide to Getting It Right, as well as David Maister's Practice What You Preach: What Managers Must Do to Create a High Achievement Culture and David Whyte's The Heart Aroused: Poetry and the Preservation of the Soul in Corporate America.e Good Life: Aristotle's Guide to Getting It Right, as well as David Maister's Practice What You Preach: What Managers Must Do to Create a High Achievement Culture and David Whyte's The Heart Aroused: Poetry and the Preservation of the Soul in Corporate America.	2005-03-24

(For example, Caligula on Values-Driven Leadership.) He carefully organizes his material within nine sections and employs the same format for each. In \\"Winning Business Strategies,\\" for example, he examines seven of Aesop's fables in terms of (a) a contemporary CEO and/or company and (b) the key lesson to be learned from that fable:<br /><br />\\"The Lion, the Bear, and the Fox\\": Michael Dell demonstrates that sometimes new opportunities exist even in a fiercely competitive society.<br /><br />\\"The Fox and the Cat\\": Dunkin Donuts demonstrates that an organization should not be distracted from what it does best.<br /><br />\\"The Fox and the Lion\\": The success of a small hardware store in direct competition with Home Depot demonstrates that, sometimes, it is both sensible and prudent to find ways to cooperate with the competition.<br /><br />\\"The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing\\": General Patton's invasion of Italy demonstrates that a sound plan executed today is preferable to a perfect plan that's too late.<br /><br />\\"The Ant and the Grasshopper\\": W. Edwards Deming's first principle of management demonstrates that effective long-term planning is the key to survival and eventual success.<br /><br />\\"The Farmer and His Sons\\": Warren Bennis' use of Avis Rent a Car demonstrates that having an appropriate vision will enable everyone involved to know the business inside and out.<br /><br />Finally, \\"The Eagle and the Beetle\\": Ulysses S. Grant's attack on Fort Donelson demonstrates the importance of determining how to get ahead of the competition...and then stay there.<br /><br />Note the variety of situations, yes, but also the diversity of focal points which range from Dell through Patton and Deming to Grant. The same can be said of each of the other sections. Who else has identified correlations between \\"The Donkey Eating Thistles\\" and Mary Kay Ash, Peggy Noonan, and Sumner Redstone? Between \\"The Fox and the Crow\\" and Dale Carnegie and Paul Harvey? Between \\"The Fox and the Goat\\" and [The] Donald Trump? Highly entertaining material, to be sure, and certainly cleverly presented.

As the subtitle of this volume correctly indicates, McGrath and MacMillan identify and then explain \\"40 strategic moves that drive exceptional business growth.\\" Decision-makers in many organizations still do not understand that strategies resemble hammers in that they \\"drive\\" tactics which are comparable with nails. Of course, both strategies and tactics must be selected with meticulous care, then implemented effectively. The core of this book involves five strategies to create \\"marketbusters\\": Transform the customers' experience, transform your offerings, redefine profit drivers, exploit industry shifts, and consider entering (for you) new markets. No news there. The value of this book is derived from McGrath and MacMillan's explanations of (a) HOW to select the strategies which are most appropriate to your organization's current and imminent needs and (b) WHAT to do when coordinating those strategies with tactics (or \\"moves\\") during the implementation process.<br /><br />To assist that process, they provide \\"Preparing Yourself: Audit Your Strategy and Clarify Your Process,\\" a self-dianostic which poses most (if not all) of the key questions to be answered and most (if not all) of the key issues to be addressed. Of special interest to me is the provision, also, of a set of \\"Action Steps\\" at the conclusion of each chapter. With regard to the \\"40 Moves,\\" they are organized as follows, accompanied by specific examples: Numbers 1-5 which involve changing the consumption chain (pages 25-39), Numbers 6-12 which various companies have used to shift the attribute maps for their offerings and create marketbusters (pages 54-76, Numbers 13-20 which suggest potential alternatives to a current unit of business (pages 92-113), Numbers 21-32 which can help to structure (or restructure) consideration of possible industrywide shifts (pages 119-148), and Numbers 33-40 which can assist the formulation of a typology of potential opportunity types and an understanding of what achieving success with each may require (pages 156-179).<br /><br />McGrath and MacMillan then provide a \\"MarketBuster Case Study\\" of Royal Insurance Italy in which they demonstrate at least some of the potentialities of the cohesive and comprehensive process previously discussed, followed by an Appendix in which all 40 \\"Moves\\" are briefly but thoughtfully reiterated. I strongly recommend to those who read this book that they re-read the Appendix at least monthly so as to be prepared to recognize whichever new growth options and opportunities may emerge since first reading this book.<br /><br />When concluding this brief commentary, I presume to offer a few caveats.

In this brilliant volume, Kaura explains HOW to design and then implement such systems. He carefully divides his material within five Parts:<br /><br />First in Chapters 1-4, he identifies the requisites of designing and implementing MCS, then explains organizational segmentation by responsibility, measures of performance, and principles of transfer pricing.<br /><br />Next in Chapters 5-9, he focuses on strategic planning and control, performance measurement by operating business units, performance measurement of service departments and coordinating units, task and operations control systems, and management control through innovative budgeting process.<br /><br />Next in Chapters 10 and 11, Kaura shifts his attention to management reporting systems (MRS) and explains how to benchmark performance through reporting for interfirm comparison.<br /><br />Then in Chapters 12 and 14, he examines how MCS can be of substantial benefit to financial institutions and export-oriented organizations; in Chapter 13, he suggests a performance planning and monitoring system for research and development.<br /><br />As for Part Five, in Chapters 15, Kaura explains how to use a Balanced Scorecard system to translate long-term objectives into operational parameters; then in the final chapter, he presents what he calls a \\"Management Audit of Control and Reporting System.\\"<br /><br />Kaura agrees with R.J. Mockler's definition of management control as being \\"the systematic effort to set standards with planning objectives, to design an information feedback system, to measure actual performance, to note deviations of the actual performance from standards and their significance and to take control action for ensuring that all the resources of the organization are most efficiently and effectively used to achieve corporate goals.\\" The ultimate objective of any MCS is to enable the given organization to be both effective and efficient. I agree with Kaura that effectiveness measures the extent of achievement of goals whereas efficiency is the relationship between input and output. \\"Even if two divisions/departments or organisations are able to deliver the same output at the same cost but consume different inputs, they can be regarded as equally effective but not equally efficient.\\" Mockler's definition guides and informs Kaura's rigorous examination of the options and opportunities which can be created by an effective and efficient Management Control System.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for Kaura's book are urged to check out Carla O'Dell's If Only We Knew What We Know: The Transfer of Internal Knowledge and Best Practice, Harvard Business Review on Knowledge Management, Nancy M.

Too many salespersons (as well as those who supervise them) do not understand the importance of obtaining permission. Specifically, permission to provide information and thereby begin what then becomes a cultivation-solicitation process. So we continue to be inundated with postal and electronic mail we do not want. Telephone calls from persistent strangers invade our personal schedules. And so forth. Why not take the time to learn how best to approach us? How best to obtain our permission to proceed? All they have to do is ask.

For example, to corporations which rely on multi-lingual communications and multi-disciplinary initiatives to compete successfully in a global marketplace.<br /><br />So, what is this book's core concept? The idea behind it is simple: \\"When you step into an intersection of fields, disciplines, or cultures, you can combine existing concepts into a large number of extraordinary ideas.\\"<br /><br />Johansson achieves three specific objectives: He explains what, exactly, \\"the Intersection is and why we can expect to see a lot more of it in the future\\"; next, he explains \\"why stepping into the Intersection creates the Medici Effect\\"; finally, he outlines \\"the unique challenges we face when executing intersectional ideas and how we can overcome those challenges.\\" With regard to the third objective, I am again reminded of a passage in Leading Change where Jim O'Toole observes that there are always unique and formidable challenges when threatening what he characterizes as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\"<br /><br />In Part One, Johansson focuses on the Intersection which, for most of us, offers the best environment in which to innovate. Next, he explains how to create the Medici Effect within that creative and collaborative environment. Then in Part Three, he offers specific suggestions as to HOW to make intersectional ideas happen. I share Johansson's faith in what an Intersection makes possible, no matter who is involved, no matter where that Intersection may be located. I also agree with him that we can all create the Medici Effect because we can all get to the Intersection. \\"The advantage goes to those with an open mind and the willingness to reach beyond their field of expertise. It goes to people who can break down barriers and stay motivated through failures.\\" There are countless examples of groups whose talented members created the Medici Effect. For example, the research laboratory which Thomas Edison established for himself and his associates in Menlo Park (NJ) in 1876; he relocated it to West Orange (NJ) in 1883.<br /><br />Warren Bennis and Patricia Ward Biederman examine more recent examples in their book, Creating Genius: the Disney studios which produced so many animation classics; Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) which developed the first personal computer; Apple Computer which then took it to market; in the so-called \\"War Room\\" which helped to elect Bill Clinton President in 1992; the so-called \\"Skunk Works\\" where so many of Lockheed's greatest designs were formulated; Black Mountain College which \\"wasn't simply a place where creative collaboration took place\\" for the artists in residence from 1933 to 1956, \\"it was about creative collaboration\\"; and Los Alamos (NM) and the University of Chicago where the Manhattan Project eventually produced a new weapon called \\"the Gadget.\\"<br /><br />Although the brief excerpt which follows is taken from Johansson's Introduction, it serves as an appropriate conclusion to my brief commentary: \\"We, too, can create the Medici Effect. We can ignite the explosion of extraordinary ideas and take advantage of its individuals, as teams, and as organizations. We can do it by bringing together different disciplines and cultures and searching for places where they connect. [begin italics] The Medici Effect [end italics] will show you how to find such intersectional ideas and make them happen. This book is not about the Renaissance era, nor is it about the the Medici family. Rather, it is about those elements that made that era possible. It is about what happens when you step into an intersection of different disciplines and cultures, and bring the ideas you find there to life.\\"<br /><br />If there is another book published in recent years which is more intellectually stimulating than this one, I have not as yet read it.step into an intersection of different disciplines and cultures, and bring the ideas you find there to life.\\"     If there is another book published in recent years which is more intellectually stimulating than this one, I have not as yet read it.	2005-03-18

(Darrell Royal)	Previously, Haughton co-authored with Jason Jennings a book which I admire very much, It's Not the Big That Eat the Small...It's the Fast That Eat the Slow, in which he and Jennings explain how to use speed to achieve and then sustain a decisive competitive advantage in business. In this volume, Haughton focuses on the importance of follow-through which he asserts (and I agree) often determines success or failure in a competitive marketplace, whatever its nature and extent may be. He insists that what makes or breaks an organization is NOT the result of finding (or not finding) the perfect strategy; rather, contrary to conventional wisdom, success or failure is determined by the nature and extent of follow-through at every and all levels of an organization.<br /><br />Haughton's conclusions and assertions are based on extensive research (his and others,' duly cited) to explain disfunctions common to most organizations. For example, a situation cited in a research study conducted by Ohio State University's Fisher College of Business:<br /><br />\\"Half of all the decisions a company makes in order to solve some problem or take advantage of some opportunity will fall through the cracks in less than two years...not because of uncontrollable factors like a recession, unexpected cost hikes or any other outside factors but simply from a lack of follow-through.\\" In this context, there appears to be what Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert I. Sutton characterize as the \\"Knowing-Doing Gap.\\" How to prevent or overcome it? Haughton identifies four \\"building blocks,\\" the components crucial to effective follow through:<br /><br />1. Having [begin italics] a clear direction [end italics] so everyone understands where they're headed in no uncertain terms.<br /><br />2. Matching [begin italics] the right people [end italics] to every goal.<br /><br />3. Getting off to a great start with plenty of [begin italics] buy-in [end italics].<br /><br />4. Making sure everyone maintains their momentum by increasing [begin italics] individual initiative [end italics].<br /><br />Easier said then done? Of course. Haughton knows that and provides in the first three chapters several specific, practical suggestions as (1) to \\"how to turn vague, general, or conflicting expectations into clear, specific, and coordinated targets -- even if you're the manager stuck in the middle between headquarters, and customers,\\" (2) \\"how to quickly connect the dots between what people say and what they really want, without them telling you in an overt of explicit manner,\\" and (3) how to formulate and then implement \\"a system for thinking things through more thoroughly (even under tight deadlines) and fine-tuning your directions with tactics prone to [begin italics] succeed [end italics].\\" The balance of this book provides addition information, observations, and suggestions -- as well as countless anecdotes, real-world examples, and executive profiles -- which will help decision-makers in any organization (regardless of size or nature) to flourish.<br /><br />Chapter 7 offers especially valuable material. In it, citing Anand Sharma's simple four-step strategy, Haughton explains how to outmaneuver the CAVE people (i.e. citizens against virtually everything) who rigorously -- and cleverly -- oppose all change initiatives which threaten what, in Leading Change, Jim O'Toole calls \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" (Please see pages 107-121 in It's Not What You Say....) Of great value, also, is Haughton's discussion of Leslie Robertson (a structural engineer who helped design the World Trade Center) and James Crowe (CEO of Level 3 Communications) in the book's final chapter. Both offer compelling examples of those who understand that follow-through is a way of life, not a strategy. As Haughton explains when concluding his book, \\"All managers must be willing to expose themselves (like Robertson and Crowe) and say, 'The robustness and stamina of the follow-through is my responsibility. All our promises have my name on them.' \\"<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this brilliant book are urged to check out the aforementioned Pfeffer and Sutton's The Knowing-Doing Gap: How Smart Companies Turn Knowledge into Action and O'Toole's Leading Change;  also Clayton M. Christensen,  Erik A. Roth, and Scott D.

By now, what could possibly be \\"new\\"? Indeed, over the years, there have been many brilliant books written about the art and science of salesmanship. For example, Neil Rackham's SPIN Selling, Michael Bosworth's Solution Selling and CustomerCentric Selling as well as Stephen E. Heiman and Diana Sanchez's The New Strategic Selling and The New Conceptual Selling®. This volume clearly deserves to be included among them.<br /><br />According to Eades, \\"Solution Selling\\" is a sales process which consists of a philosophy (the customer is the focal point), a map (how to get from where you are to where you want to be), a methodology (it includes tools, job aids, techniques, and procedures to succeed), and a sales management system (by which to analyze pipelines, qualify opportunities, and coach skills). Thus summarized, \\"Solution Selling\\" may seem to many, especially those with years of sales experience, to be simplistic. In fact, Eades offers some thought-provoking and unorthodox perspectives on what is seldom (if ever) simple: Persuading a sufficient number of people to buy whatever you offer for sale and then continue to do so, and at a margin sufficient to ensure sustainable profitability for your organization. Amazon and Borders offer this volume for sale in combination with Bosworth's book of the same title. Yes, there is much common material but also significant differences which reveal themselves when both Bosworth's book and then Eades's book are read in sequence.<br /><br />FYI, I am among those who believe that (a) marketing and sales are separate but interdependent areas of activity, and (b) directly or indirectly, everyone within a given organization should be involved in both. With his material carefully organized within five Parts, Eades explains \\"Solution Selling\\" concepts; how to create new opportunities (e.g. \\"Diagnosing Before You Prescribe\\"); how to engage in active opportunities (e.g. \\"Selling When  You Are Not First\\"), how to gain access to people with power, control the selling process, and close; and how to manage the sales process (e.g. \\"Creating and Sustaining High Performance Sales Cultures.\\" Once marketing initiatives have created or increased demand for what is offered, the sale must then be made. Literally [in italics] everyone [end italics] within a given organization can and should -- directly or indirectly -- support marketing and sales initiatives.<br /><br />Of course, it remains for each reader to determine which of Eades's ideas are most relevant, and, how best to apply them within a given competitive environment. However, I presume to offer a concluding word of caution: Make certain that you have a [in italics] repeatable, integrated sales execution process [end italics] rather than a grab bag of disconnected, often contradictory ideas about sales.

The \\"rules\\" which Little offers in this volume could well have been 11 or 21...if not more. All are essential to business success. For example, \\"Establish and maintain a strong sense of purpose\\" (#1) and \\"Attract and keep the best and brightest\\" (#6). No news there. The great value of this book is derived from what Little has to say about each rule and, more importantly, HOW and WHY all seven are interdependent. At this point, it may be of interest to share information cited by Michael Gerber in his recently published E-Myth Mastery: \\"Of the 1 million U.S. small businesses started this year [2005], more than 80% of them will be out of business within 5 years and 96% will have closed their doors before their 10th birthday.\\" Opinions vary as to the percentages as well as to the reasons for such extensive failure. However, the fact remains that a substantial majority of small businesses will fail eventually.<br /><br />Now consider the following remarks with which Jack Welch explains why he admires entrepreneurial companies: \\"For one, they communicate better. Without the din and prattle of bureaucracy, people listen as well as talk; and since there are fewer of them they generally know and understand each other. Second, small companies move faster. They know the penalties for hesitation in the marketplace. Third, in small companies, with fewer layers and less camouflage, the leaders show up very clearly on the screen. Their performance and its impact are clear to everyone. And, finally, smaller companies waste less. They spend less time in endless reviews and approvals and politics and paper drills. They have fewer people; therefore they can only do the important things. Their people are free to direct their energy and attention toward the marketplace rather than fighting bureaucracy.\\"<br /><br />In this volume, Little suggests strategies and tactics  to achieve and sustain many of the competitive advantages to which Welch refers. His tone is personal, indeed conversational, and he thereby establishes a direct rapport with his reader; moreover, he anchors his observations and recommendations within a real-world context, mercifully free of theories and hypotheses; also, he addresses how and why as well as what to do; and finally, following his rigorous analysis of each of the seven rules (to each of which he devotes a separate chapter), Little then provides a suggested Next Steps section which reiterates key points concerning implementation. I also appreciate Little's inclusion of hundreds of personal anecdotes which add some seasoning to an already lively narrative. This book offers a practical, cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective program by which all organizations (regardless of size or nature) can achieve and then sustain profitable growth. It will be of greatest interest to decision-makers in smaller organizations...and perhaps to decision-makers in larger organizations which have lost their entrepreneurial spirit.sustain many of the competitive advantages to which Welch refers.

(His reader is encouraged to visit e-myth.com to learn more about the research he and his associates have accumulated from those client relationships.) In this his most recently published book, Gerber invites his reader to join him for what he describes as \\"an entrepreneurial adventure\\" and indeed it is just that as Gerber demonstrates that entrepreneurs are born, not made; that very few people have the unique entrepreneurial qualities of unremitting advocacy, evangelism, and dedication; and that entrepreneurship is an art, NOT a science. He is absolutely convinced that those who read this book, then master and apply seven essential disciplines can help grow their respective organizations into a flourishing enterprise. As he carefully explains in Chapter One, for example, \\"the discipline of enterprise leadership, and the rules, standards, and practices which define it, [in italics] are the same no matter where they are practiced, regardless of the type and size of business.\\" [end italics]<br /><br />It would be a disservice to Gerber as well as to those who read this review to say any more about this \\"discipline\\" or about any of the other six. Suffice to say that they are are based on Gerber's vast experience. It may also be of significant interest to share Gerber's observation that \\"Of the 1 million U.S. small businesses started this year [2005], more than 80% of them will be out of business within 5 years and 96% will have closed their doors before their 10th birthday.\\" These are indeed chilling statistics.<br /><br />When explaining why he greatly admires entrepreneurial companies, Jack Welch once said: \\"For one, they communicate better.

Gerber answers these and other critically important questions in this brilliant book.<br /><br />One final point: Mastering \\"the seven essential disciplines\\" is VERY HARD WORK. Those who have any doubt about that are again reminded of the fatality rate of most U.S. small businesses. I also presume to suggest that Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert I.

It was one of the 11 original teams in the American Professional Football Association, of which Halas was a co-founder and its driving force. The APFA became the National Football League in 1922. With all due respect to his achievements as a coach, Halas deserves much (if not most) of the credit for keeping professional football alive. At least until the emergence of television, baseball really was the national pastime and college football was much more popular (and credible) than was the NFL and the All-American Football Conference which challenged it after World War Two.<br /><br />It is debatable when all this changed. Many cite the the Baltimore Colts victory in overtime against the New York Giants in the NFL championship game (December 28, 1958), others Pete Rozelle's leadership as commissioner (1960-1989 and especially during his first years in that office), and still others a program which CBS televised in 1960 as part of its Twentieth Century series, \\"The Violent World of Sam Huff.\\" Having personally observed the NFL's exceptional growth throughout the 1950s and 1960s, my own opinion is that there were many factors which certainly include these three.<br /><br />In 1960, 36% of those interviewed during a Harris poll selected baseball as their favorite sport, a substantial lead over pro football's 21%. Only ten years later, MacCambridge notes \\"a shocking change: 38 percent for pro football, 23 percent for baseball.\\" He observes: \\"This was more than just a generational shift, signaling younger adults raised on football replacing a generation that had grown up listening to baseball on the crystal set. It showed that the NFL was reaching a vast, upwardly mobile middle class, and changing their loyalties. Conversely, the Grand Old Game of baseball -- plagued in 1968 by a historic offensive drought and slumping attendance -- for the first time seemed to have become pass&eacute;, quaint, an anachronism representative of little more than nostalgia for an earlier, simpler time. This was a gross oversimplification, of course, but the truth remained that while football soared, baseball floundered, prisoner to its own complacence.\\"<br /><br />Although MacCambridge devotes a great deal of his attention to individuals and especially important games, his primary objective is to explain how and why \\"In the span of two generations in postwar America, pro football became a truer and more vivid reflection of the American preoccupations with power and passion, technology and teamwork, than any other sporting institution in the country.\\" Credit MacCambridge with providing, in my opinion, the best analysis thus far of the National Football League's evolution to supremacy.

For example, Cinderella, The Frog King, H&auml;nsel and Grethel, Little Snow-White, and Rapunzel. (The \\"unvarnished\\" versions of these and other tales are provided at [...]) Obviously, the co-authors of this book were inspired by The Frog King in which they found several important lessons which are relevant to -- but by no means limited to -- the business world. Indeed, as Tom Donohue correctly notes in the Foreword, there is \\"a compelling link\\" between successful positive networking and personal happiness.<br /><br />As I read this book, I was reminded of Emanuel Rosen's observations and suggestions in The Anatomy of Buzz: How to Create Word of Mouth Marketing. In the Foreword to that book, Everett M. Rogers observes, \\"New products and services spread among the consumer public through interpersonal communication networks. These networks are for the most part invisible. They often operate in mysterious ways...Thus we are largely blind to this very powerful marketing process.\\" He's right.<br /><br />Presumably the co-authors of The Frog and Prince also agree. In their book, they provide a thoughtful and eloquent explanation of both the How and the Why of positive networking which is indeed \\"for the most part invisible\\" and \\"operate[s] in mysterious ways.\\" Once properly understood, however, and if initiated and then sustained, positive networking is indeed a \\"very powerful marketing process.\\" In Chapters 3-9, the co-authors rigorously examine this process using the acronym NETWORK. More specifically,<br /><br />N: Never Leave Home Without Them<br />E: The Four E's -- Establish, Extend, Exchange, Engage<br />T: Travel in Pairs<br />W: Working the Pond -- Positively<br />O: Opportunity is Everywhere<br />R: Repeat, Repeat, Repeat<br />K: Keep It Going<br /><br />It would be a disservice to the co-authors as well as to those who read this review to say more about the material in each of these chapters, except to suggest that their titles correctly indicate the principles which guide and inform the positive networking process. Also, that the principles are sound, the explanations of them are clear, and the co-authors' recommendations (i.e. HOW to apply them) are practical.<br /><br />As Rosen would be the first to point out, there are two kinds of BUZZ (positive and negative) and each can have great impact. The same can be said of networking. In terms of personal as well as organizational development, each person within a given organization is (to varying degrees) its representative. Think of all of them as \\"messengers.\\" Those who manifest admirable qualities and impeccable behavior deliver \\"positive messages.\\" As for others who manifest contemptible qualities and unacceptable behavior, they (obviously) deliver \\"negative messages\\" and should immediately be sent packing.<br /><br />In our careers as in our personal lives, most of the time, we get out of a relationship about as much as we are willing and able to invest in it. However defined, success can often be measured in terms of the number and quality of the linkages we establish and develop, indeed nourish with family members, friends, and business associates. So yes, The Frog and Prince is based on a fairy tale and offers several lessons from it that have direct relevance to the business world. I also think these same lessons suggest how participation in the positive networking process can significantly accelerate and enrich the personal development of those engaged in that process.<br /><br />If you share my high regard for this book, check out Franklin's Autobiography, Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People, Hill's Think and Grow Rich, Goldman and Smythe's How to Make a Million Dollar First Impression, and Hankins' The Power of the Pitch.y more about the material in each of these chapters, except to suggest that their titles correctly indicate the principles which guide and inform the positive networking process.

For example, Strunk and White's The Elements of Style, Zinnser's On Writing Well, and Hacker's Rules for Writers. To them I now add this book. The Book on Writing is widely adopted (or recommended) by school, college, and university instructors. I think it will also be of great value to just about anyone else who needs to improve reasoning and reading as well as writing skills.  LaRocque divides her 22 chapters within two parts, \\"A Dozen Guidelines to Good Writing\\" and \\"Language and Mechanics.\\" The chapter titles suggest several key points, all of which are evident in the non-fiction of masters such as George Orwell and E.B. White. For example:<br /><br />Chapter 1: Keep Sentences Short, and Keep to One Main Idea Per Sentence<br />Chapter 5: Use the Right Word<br />Chapter 7: Prefer Active Verbs and the Active Voice<br />Chapter 8: Cut Wordiness<br />Chapter 12: Get Right to the Point. And Stay There<br /><br />Although these and other of LaRocque's guidelines may seem obvious, my own experience as a classroom teacher suggests that few students seem to be aware of them...and even fewer follow them. (FYI, I taught English for 13 years in two New England boarding schools -- Kent and St. George's -- and for the past 10 years have been an adjunct professor of English at a local community college in the Dallas area.) What sets LaRocque's book apart from almost all others which cover much of the same material is that her personal, indeed conversational style establishes and then sustains a tutorial relationship with her reader; also, throughout her book, she includes hundreds of real-world examples of writing which is correct or incorrect, appropriate or inappropriate, effective or ineffective.<br /><br />In Chapter 23, LaRocque includes \\"A Brief (But Not Necessarily Easy) Quiz\\" which I encourage everyone to take before reading anything else in the book. The quiz consists of 20 sentences. LaRocque then identifies \\"common grammar and punctuation problems that trouble many people,\\" followed by \\"A Pronoun primer\\" because she asserts (and I agree) that proper use of pronouns will solve most of the most common grammar problems. By first taking the quiz and then reviewing the explanations and pronoun primer which follow, most readers will have a strong motivation to absorb and digest the material provided in the other 24 chapters.<br /><br />I anticipate that many of them will then purchase copies of The Book on Writing to be given to family members, friends, and associates. It would be an especially appropriate birthday, holiday, or graduation gift to students as well as to those recently embarked on their career, perhaps accompanied by a copy of Orwell's A Collection of Essays and/or Essays of E. B. White (Perennial Classics). Both are also available in an inexpensive paperbound edition.<br /><br />Paula LaRocque, well-done!entifies \\"common grammar and punctuation problems that trouble many people,\\" followed by \\"A Pronoun primer\\" because she asserts (and I agree) that proper use of pronouns will solve most of the most common grammar problems.

[end italics] Pitches could be delivered in person, over the telephone, to one person or to thousands.\\" This definition is adequate to Hankins' purposes, but -- in my opinion -- unnecessarily restrictive. Some of the most important interactions between and among people involve the exchange of information, not for purposes of persuasion but for edification. Indeed, every one of the principles, skills, and techniques which Hankins explains so brilliantly in this book can guide and inform effective communication, whatever its context and objective may be.<br /><br />That said, I commend Hankins on having devised what amounts to a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system. Chapters 1-7 provide an orientation/briefing on fundamentals (e.g. \\"The Secrets of Winning People Over\\" and \\"The Foolproof Steps to Avoid Embarrassment\\"). Each of the next three chapters is devoted to one of the three Parts of \\"The Pitch\\": The Grabber, The Persuasion Model, and The Power Close. Then in Chapters 11-17, Hankins correlates and develops in much greater depth various principles, skills, and techniques (e.g. storytelling, use of humor, secrets to effective cold calls), concluding with an obviously sincere admonition to his reader, accompanied by a request: \\"Now I encourage you to personalize the concepts about how you look, how you sound, and what you say. Make the `toolbox' fit your persona and business. When you do, you will become a persuasive presenter capable of winning more business. Please do me a big favor. As you achieve success with your pitches, take a minute to let me know how you're doing. Please e-mail me at gary.hankins@pygmalioninc.com. [Then suggesting an influence by Zig Ziglar,] The view is worth the climb. I look forward to seeing you at the top.\\"<br /><br />To me, one of the most valuable sections is Chapter 9 in which Hankins provides \\"The Power of the Pitch Outline\\" (pages 119-121). Completion of this outline will require a great deal of time and thought. In fact, throughout this book, Hankins includes a wealth of checklists, introduces several acronyms (e.g. STARs) which are then explained in depth, and various guidelines (e.g. \\"The Rule of Three\\"). Hankins' approach is so direct and personal that his reader will feel as if she or he were working closely in collaboration with Hankins on the development of a complete sales plan which is most appropriate to the reader's own specific needs, interests, goals, objectives, and concerns.<br /><br />For whom will this book be most valuable? I recommend it to those who supervise a sales force, many of whom are relatively inexperienced and in need of inspiration, guidance, and supervision. I also recommend it to senior-level executives in small-to-midsize organizations who are primarily -- if not wholly -- responsible for business development and customer relationships (e.g. the owner/CEO of a company doing less than $10-million in annual sales). As with almost all other human enterprises, each reader will get about as much out of this book as she or he puts into it.<br /><br />On numerous occasions I have observed a \\"pitch\\" which had great power...but created an almost totally negative impact. Hence the importance of knowing precisely what you wish to accomplish when applying the material in this book. Presumably Hankins agrees with me that sincerity, thorough preparation, common sense, and respect for others' time are more important than impeccable grooming, a stylish wardrobe, and a pleasing personality.

For example, what Patrick Murray refers to in his own review:  \\"The fusiform gyrus is not a piece of brain software (page 219), the midbrain doesn't hijack the forebrain much less reach up to hijack it (page 225), and it is doubtful that rapid heart beats shut down the motor systems or any other brain component (pages 220-225).\\" The comments which follow limit their attention to what I understand to be Gladwell's core concepts and key assertions with regard to the decision-making process. These are the ones which are of greatest interest to me:<br /><br />1. What Gladwell refers to as \\"the adaptive unconscious\\" has a much greater influence on our judgments as well as on our pre-judgments (or prejudices) than most of us realize. This explains why we often react with \\"intuitive\\" repulsion or  attraction to another person...or to a given option, peril, suggestion, opportunity, request, etc.<br /><br />2. \\"Paralysis by analysis\\" can result in what Gladwell refers to as \\"momentary autism\\" (i.e. a non-decision) which may or may not prove beneficial.<br /><br />3. In certain crises (e.g. an ambush, a train wreck, a medical emergency), snap decisions must often be made without benefit of sufficient information. \\"The power of knowing, in that first two seconds, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few. It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves.\\"<br /><br />For me this last is Gladwell's most important point, one which he really could have developed in much greater depth: It is not only possible but highly desirable to become so knowledgeable about a given subject that one can almost immediately complete an accurate diagnosis and then take or recommend appropriate action. I have personally observed this skill on numerous occasions in emergency rooms, automotive shops, and during appliance service calls. The physician, mechanic, or electrician quickly checks out the most revealing symptoms and then knows (if not \\"in that first two seconds\\") precisely what must be done. Theirs are really not \\"snap\\" decisions; rather, they are based on years of experience which have revealed the criteria by which to make the most appropriate judgments in a timely manner.<br /><br />I am intrigued by the possibility that when one develops the skill by which to make such judgments, each such judgment then becomes what Gladwell characterizes as a \\"tipping point,\\" after which there is an acceleration of subsequent events, results, consequences, etc. Perhaps in his next book, Gladwell will explore that possibility.electrician quickly checks out the most revealing symptoms and then knows (if not \\"in that first two seconds\\") precisely what must be done.

However, I wish they had developed several of their core concepts in much greater depth and with tone and diction worthy of those insights. I groaned when encountering clunkers such as \\"Get off that river in Egypt -- De-Nile!\\" because Brandon and Seldman are not \\"teaching synchronized swimming in a shark tank!\\" Then \\"Merge into the Savvy Zone\\" while recognizing the importance of \\"Different Strokes for Different Folks.\\" (I'm not making this stuff up. It's in the book.) That said, Brandon and Seldman generally succeed when recommending and then explaining \\"high integrity political tactics for career and company success.\\"<br /><br />When reflecting on his career, President Harry S Truman proudly described himself as a politician, reputedly claiming that politics \\"is the art of the possible.\\" It should be added that throughout Truman's public service, his personal integrity was impeccable. Brandon and Seldman make two obvious but important points: Like it or not, politics are inevitable when two or more -- and especially when three or more -- people are involved, and, it is nonetheless possible to be (as was Truman) an effective politician without compromising one's integrity. In fact, as Jim O'Toole asserts in The Executive's Compass: Business and the Good Society as does David Maister in Practice What You Preach: What Managers Must Do to Create a High Achievement Culture, those whose lives are guided and informed by admirable values (e.g. honesty, loyalty, decency, trustworthiness) will achieve much greater success than will those whose lives aren't. Therefore, the \\"savvy\\" executive is one who combines high principles with street smarts. No news there.<br /><br />What gives substantial value to this book is Brandon and Seldman's clever use of various devices with which their reader can conduct a self-audit. Long ago, after a substantial increase of tuition at Harvard, hostile parents confronted then president Derek Bok. His response: \\"If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.\\" I thought of that comment as I examined the various self-diagnostic elements in this book. Two of the most damaging forms of ignorance are (a) not knowing what you need to know and (b) assuming what you think you know...but don't. To their credit, Brandon and Seldman make a rigorous effort to help their reader to reduce (if not eliminate) both forms of ignorance. Politicking, gossip, self-serving motives, back-stabbing, betrayals of confidence, etc. are harsh realities in almost any organization. Brandon and Seldman can help principled people to cope effectively with those realities. To me, that is this book's greatest benefit. Also, I strongly recommend that readers complete the comprehensive, self-scoring assessment tool and interpretative guide which Brandon and Seldman offer. How to obtain one? The authors explain on page 277.<br /><br />As indicated earlier, I think the quality of thinking and (especially) the quality of writing in this book are too often a distraction from the quite important convictions and counsel which the authors share. Over-heated diction and under-developed ideas in combination with clich&eacute;s prevent me from giving this book a higher rating.fronted then president Derek Bok.

This is an especially thought-provoking book which, as have so many others, evolved from an article published in the Harvard Business Review. According to Kim and Mauborgne, \\"[in italics] Blue ocean strategy [end italics] challenges companies to break out of the red ocean of bloody competition by creating uncontested market space that makes the competition irrelevant...This book not only challenges companies but also shows them how to achieve this. We first introduce a set of analytical tools and frameworks that show you how to systematically act on this challenge, and, second, we elaborate the principles that define and separate blue ocean strategy from competition-based strategic thought.\\" There are six principles which are introduced and then discussed on pages 49, 82, 102, 117, 143, and 172, respectively.<br /><br />Frankly, I was somewhat skeptical that this book could deliver on the promises made in its subtitle. In fact, the material provided by Kim and Mauborgne is essentially worthless unless and until decision-makers in a given organization accept the challenge,  are guided and informed by the six principles, and effectively use the tools within appropriate frameworks. The responsibility is theirs, not Kim and Mauborgne's. To assist their efforts, Kim and Mauborgne focus on several exemplary companies which have dominated (if not rendered irrelevant) their competition by penetrating previously neglected market space. They include the Body Shop, Callaway Golf, Cirque du Soleil, Dell, NetJets, the SONY Walkman, Southwest Airlines, Starbucks, the Swatch watch, and Yellow Tail wine.<br /><br />Of greatest interest to me is Kim and Mauborgne's assertion that the innovations which enabled these companies to succeed with a Blue Ocean strategy did NOT depend upon a new technology. Rather, each company pursued a strategy which enabled it to free itself from industry boundaries. For Dell, that meant mass production of computers sold directly to consumers per each customer's specifications. Quite literally, each sale is \\"customized.\\" For Callaway, creating an enlarged sweet spot to increase the frequency of solid contact for new or infrequent golfers just as, years ago, the enlarged Head racquet did so for new or infrequent tennis players. For Starbucks, creating a congenial environment within which to socialize, go online, or read while consuming coffee. All of these Blue Ocean strategies created new or much greater value for customers. Their emphasis is on the quality of experience, not on the benefits of a new technology.<br /><br />According to Kim and Mauborgne, their research indicates that \\"the strategic move, and not the company or the industry, is the right unit of analysis for explaining the creation of blue oceans and sustained high performance. A strategic move is the set of managerial actions and decisions involved in making a major market-creating business offering.\\" The cornerstone of a Blue Ocean strategy is value innovation which occurs \\"only when companies align innovation with utility, price, and cost positions. If they fail to anchor innovation with value in this way, technology innovators and market pioneers often lay the eggs that other companies hatch.\\"  For Kim and Mauborgne, value innovation is about strategy that embraces the entire system of a company's activities. It requires companies to orient the whole system toward achieving a \\"leap\\" in value for both buyers and themselves. Kim and Mauborgne explain HOW to create uncontested market space wherein competition is essentially irrelevant.<br /><br />To paraphrase Henry Ford, whether decision-makers think they can or think they can't do that, they're right.ach customer's specifications.

More important, we attempt to establish [in italics] why [end italics] the thinking must be in such a way.\\" Karamchedu also examines the reasons for the failure for so many new product designs which are launched in the high technology sector. \\"Either the product is not what the customer wanted, or the product did not arrive in time, or [it] did not have a compelling advantage over that of its competitor's. Karamchedu identifies three reasons, any one of which could ensure failure. I was also interested in what Karamchedu had to say about an especially formidable challenge: To coordinate, indeed integrate harmonious collaboration between engineering groups and marketing teams.<br /><br />Karamchedu carefully organizes 20 chapters within four Parts: The Thinking (e.g. \\"The Problem\\"), The Forward Movement Latent in Execution (e.g. \\"The Context of Execution\\"), High Tech Contexts: A Semiconductor Company View (e.g. \\"The Semiconductor Value Chain\\"), and The Craft and the Mindset (e.g. \\"Manage Expectations\\"). If I understand Karamchedu correctly (and I may not), he asserts that more often than not, failure in the high-tech marketplace is not the result of faulty technology and/or a defective strategy; rather, because of a lack of cooperation and collaboration between/among engineers and marketers. This lack of interaction almost always results in ineffective execution. Market windows come and go unrecognized until it is too late. Karamchedu responds to one of the most important questions posed in this book: How is it that, in spite of making remarkable strides in high technology product design, development and deployment of these products in markets, we are still struggling to create a harmony between marketing and engineering professionals?\\"<br /><br />For me, Chapter 10 (\\"The Context of Execution\\") is one of the most interesting and most valuable because it is in this chapter that Karamchedu focuses on a framework of contexts: the technological, the customer, and the economic. All three must be engaged in driving whatever individual employees create, build, and deploy in the market. Thus viewed, \\"a high technology company is simply a confluence of the three contexts.\\" Karamchedu views all this as a powerful new paradigm to connect the three contexts with the circle of execution. How? Please see page 92.<br /><br />Lest these brief remarks incorrectly suggest that this is an especially theoretical, hypothetical book, I hasten to observe that Karamchedu seems well aware of that peril and for that reason includes dozens of concrete examples which effectively illustrate his key points. If I have a concern, it is that the material may seem too technical to marketing executives and not technical enough to engineers. I agree with Karamchedu that \\"the strength of any high technology product is differentiation and a focused approach to selected markets.\\" Hence the importance of having a vision which provides a clear, unquestionable, solid identity as to [in italics] what we are as a company.\\" Karamchedu views his approach in this book as an \\"experiment\\" and it probably is.

Smart explains why the average cost of a mis-hire is 24 times the annual salary. (That's right: 24 times the annual salary.) I am unaware of what the average cost of losing a highly-valued employee would be but it must certainly be substantial.  This book is based on a wealth of research conducted by or in collaboration with the Saratoga Institute. The observations and conclusions which Branham shares are wholly consistent with what has been revealed by countless other research studies. According to Branham, there are four fundamental human needs. If one or more are not being met, an employee becomes dissatisfied, less productive, perhaps disruptive, and usually leaves. These needs are for trust and hope as well as for feeling a sense of worth and of having competence. No news there.<br /><br />This book's value is derived from what Branham has to say about seven less obvious (if not \\"hidden\\") needs. He focuses on several \\"subtle signs\\" by which to identify them and then suggests how to take appropriate action before it is too late. For example, Reason #1: the job or workplace was not as expected. Whose fault is that? Could be those involved in the interview/hiring process who over-sold the job; could be the person hired. Perhaps blame must be shared by everyone directly involved. In any event, Branham explains HOW to recognize the warning signs of unmet expectations, identifies obstacles to meeting mutual expectations, and suggests eight specific \\"engagement practices\\" for matching mutual expectations. Branham also devotes an entire chapter to each of the other six reasons, followed by two appendices, each of which all by itself is well worth the cost of this book. Appendix A offers a \\"Summary Checklist of Employer-of-Choice Engagement Practices\\"; Appendix B offers \\"Guidelines and Considerations for Exit Interviewing/Surveying and Turnover Analysis.\\"<br /><br />Experts on employee relations agree with experts on customer relations that feeling appreciated is ranked among the three most important attributes, with compensation and cost ranked anywhere from 9th to 12th. If the research studies are reliable (and I believe they are), what they indicate is that the best employees and the best customers \\"leave\\" for the same \\"hidden reasons\\" which Branham examines in this book. If your organization is experiencing such losses, this is a book which should be read and then re-read ASAP. However, Branham's book is essentially worthless if appropriate actions are not then taken immediately. Perhaps policies and procedures need to be revised. Perhaps feedback surveys need to be conducted. Perhaps there are communication problems to be solved. Branham can help each reader to measure the nature and extent of what must be done.

In this new edition, they share much of the same material found in the first edition (Great Meetings! How to Facilitate Like a Pro) but develop it in much greater depth, in response to extensive feedback which they have obtained since 1997. They respond to questions such as these:<br /><br />What distinguishes facilitation from meeting organization, process design, process coaching, and organizational development consulting?<br /><br />How to achieve effective group dynamics?<br /><br />How best to prepare for a meeting?<br /><br />How to design a great meeting?<br /><br />Which three basic process steps are involved?<br /><br />Which tools are needed to generate and evaluate ideas which result in appropriate decisions?<br /><br />How to maximize a group's potential?<br /><br />Which skills are need to promote positive communication?<br /><br />How best to avoid or resolve conflicts?<br /><br />When should a facilitator intervene in a group discussion? (When not to?)<br /><br />How to enhance the group discussion with graphics? How best to integrate them?<br /><br />Which personal issues are most significant to effective facilitation?<br /><br />Kelsey and Plumb offer countless suggestions as to What to do, How to do it, What NOT to do, and Why. Those who are relatively inexperienced in terms of meeting facilitation will probably derive the greatest value from this book but I think it can also be of substantial benefit to others in need of fresh perspectives, sharper skills, and additional tools as they prepare to facilitate the next group meeting. When concluding this brief commentary, I presume to share a few thoughts of my own. First, make certain that there is a compelling need for a meeting. Second, include only those who are essential to the success of the meeting. Third, share the agenda in advance. Fourth, identify specific objectives and limit the discussion to achieving them. Finally, make certain when determining next steps that each task has an \\"owner\\" and a deadline. Follow up to ensure that everyone follows through.

This is one of the volumes in the new Harvard Business Essentials Series. Each offers authoritative answers to the most important questions concerning its specific subject. The material in this book is drawn from a variety of sources which include the Harvard Business School Press and the Harvard Business Review as well as Harvard ManageMentor®, an online service. I strongly recommend the official Harvard Business Essentials Web site ([...]) which offers free interactive versions of tools, checklists, and worksheets cited in this book and other books in the Essentials series. Each volume is indeed \\"a highly practical resource for readers with all levels of experience.\\" And each is by intent and in execution solution-oriented. Although I think those who have only recently embarked on a business career will derive the greatest benefit, the material is well-worth a periodic review by senior-level executives.<br /><br />Credit Richard Luecke with pulling together a wealth of information and counsel from various sources. He is also the author of several other books in the Essentials series. In this instance, he was assisted by a subject advisor, Christopher Bartlett, the Thomas D. Casserly, Jr. Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration. Together, they have carefully organized the material as follows. Part I \\"addresses five basic but essential skills needed to build the the foundation of a powerful and high-performing manager\\" (e.g. setting goals that others will pursue). Part II moves on to more challenging skills (e.g. creating and supervising effective team-based initiatives). Then in Part III, Luecke and Bartlett focus on the specific financial tools that every mid- to higher-level manager should understand and learn to apply (e.g. budgeting, the ability to read and interpret financial statements, net present analysis and internal rate of return). I also urge readers to pay close attention to the \\"For Further Reading\\" section which can be found at the end of this book. In it, they are provided with references to recent books and articles -- many of them \\"classics\\" -- which offer  additional material and unique insights into the various topics covered in the previous 16 chapters. I especially appreciate the \\"Key Topics Covered in This Chapter\\" and \\"Summing Up\\" sections which precede and follow each of the chapters.<br /><br />Luecke and Bartlett are to be commended for covering such a wide range of subjects and for doing so in depth. For most executives as well as for those now embarked on preparation for a career in business, this may well prove to be the single most valuable volume in the Harvard Business Essentials Series.tion which can be found at the end of this book.

In each, he offers specific tips which, for those with extensive sales experience and sustained success, may seem obvious. While many of his suggestions are obvious, such as organizing your prospect database or developing an Industry-Specific Positioning Statement (ISPS), the fact remains that his tips offer substantial value if only as reminders. Everyone in sales encounters a period of failure when they begin to question what they are doing wrong. Reviewing Schell's key points will reveal what they have taken for granted, ignored, neglected or bungled.<br /><br />In addition, Schell includes dozens of comments from 228 buyers who agreed to 330 interviews and provided responses to 4,327 questions. In one of the most interesting chapters entitled, \\"How to annoy buyers-guaranteed,\\" respondents warrant the guarantee. They confirm that the most successful salespeople know which questions to ask of both prospects and customers. They spend at least 80% of the time listening to the buyer's responses. He also includes a Planning Guide with each chapter using a \\"Permission-Based Model.\\" This book is both a manual and a workbook, one whose material each reader should modify to accommodate her or his specific needs, interests, goals, and circumstances.<br /><br />Here's a suggestion: Select ten to fifteen customers and schedule a meeting with each. Ask two questions. \\"What do you like best about doing business with me? and \\"What more can I do to be of greater service to you and to your company?\\" The responses may surprise you. You may also be surprised by how eager the buyers are to respond. Why? In all probability, they are seldom asked those two questions. What does that reveal about your own customer relationships? Of equal (if not greater) importance, what does that reveal about your competitors? If you now lack a decisive competitive advantage, a frank conversation with several of your customers may well identify one for you.es that reveal about your competitors?

Both Halas and Auerbach were obviously great coaches but also outstanding CEOs, each building a successful and profitable franchise while playing a key role in a multi-billion dollar professional organization. In this instance, the National Football League. Born and raised in Chicago, I was especially interested in what seems to be the definitive biography of Halas, the longtime owner and coach of that city's NFL team, Duh Bears. It must have taken someone with both his most attractive qualities (e.g. vision, generosity, perseverance, self-confidence) and his most unattractive qualities (e.g. duplicity, arrogance, stubbornness, and -- at times -- paranoia) to accomplish what he did...which was indeed a great deal.<br /><br />For example, Halas played as a right fielder with the New York Yankees until replaced...by Babe Ruth. He then concentrated on a career in football, playing for as well as coaching the Decatur (IL) Staleys which he organized in 1920.  It was one of the 11 original teams in the American Professional Football Association, of which Halas was a co-founder and its driving force. The APFA became the National Football League in 1922. Thirty-five (35) franchises folded during its first ten seasons. It was also in 1922 that Halas relocated his team to Chicago and re-named it the Bears. From 1920 until 1929, he was a coach/player and then concentrated entirely on coaching during three periods (1933-42, 1946-55, and 1958-68), during which the Bears won seven NFL championships and Halas was credited with a then league-record of 325 wins. Only Don Shula has won more.<br /><br />With all due respect to his achievements as a coach, Halas deserves much (if not most) of the credit for keeping professional football alive. At least until the emergence of television, baseball really was the national pastime and college football was much more popular (and credible) than was the NFL and the All-American Football Conference which challenged it after World War Two. It is debatable when all this changed. Many cite the the Baltimore Colts victory in overtime against the New York Giants in the NFL championship game (December 28, 1958), others Pete Rozelle's leadership as commissioner (1960-1989 and especially during his first years in that office), and still others a program which CBS televised in 1960 as part of its Twentieth Century series, \\"The Violent World of Sam Huff.\\" Having personally observed the NFL's exceptional growth throughout the 1950s and 1960s, my own opinion is that there were many factors which certainly include these three. Point is, there would have been no NFL as we now know it without the contributions which George Halas made.<br /><br />That said, there are many (including several who played for Halas) who would agree with then Chicago Daily News columnist Mike Royko that Halas was \\"a tight-fisted, stubborn, willful, mean old man...[adding that] there isn't a famous Chicagoan in or out of jail who generates such intense dislike.\\" Unlike Arnold (\\"Red\\") Auerbach who frequently claimed that he could forgive but never forget a perceived grievance, Halas often seems incapable of either. Davis examines this in several of Halas' relationships with various assistant coaches and players as well as with several owners. However, it is most evident in his relationship with son-in-law Michael McCaskey who married daughter Virginia. Near death, as Halas considered who would next head the franchise, he sighed \\"Anybody but Michael.\\" That deathbed wish would be denied.<br /><br />Davis cites numerous examples of Halas' generosity, notably the fact that he paid for nearly all of the immense medical expenses during Brian Piccolo's losing battle with cancer. In the Foreword, Gale Sayers observes, \\"I love George Halas. When I talk aboutGeorge Halas on speaking tours, I always say that. I thought that way about him. He made me a better person. He made a young man a better man just by talking to him, offering his advice. I always listened to him. I will always remember him. I appreciate him.\\"  Many others share their own fond memories as well appreciation of Halas' often concealed kindnesses.<br /><br />Davis's research seems exhaustive. He conducted hundreds of in-depth interviews with those who were most closely associated with Halas, including many with whom Halas had serious, at times rancorous disagreements (e.g. Dick Butkus) This is probably the definitive biography of the Old Man but it also offers a wealth of information about the process by which professional football evolved to its current place in American society. As Davis asserts and I agree, no one played a more prominent role during that process than did Papa Bear.rs, I always say that. I thought that way about him. He made me a better person.

Both Auerbach and Halas were obviously great coaches but also outstanding CEOs, each building a successful and profitable franchise while playing a key role in a multi-billion dollar professional organization. In this instance, the National Basketball Association.<br /><br />Although generally viewed as a sportswriter, Feinstein has always seemed (to me, at least) to be a cultural anthropologist who works very hard to understand not only major sports figures and events but also their social context. This is especially true of A March to Madness: A View from the Floor in the Atlantic Coast Conference, The Last Amateurs: Playing for Glory and Honor in Division I College Basketball, A Civil War: Army Vs. Navy (A Year Inside College Football's Purest Rivalry), and A Season on the Brink, a detailed account of the Indiana University men's basketball team's 1985-1986 season.<br /><br />What we have in this volume is Feinstein's account of his close association with Arnold (\\"Red\\") Auerbach over a four-year period during which Feinstein was included among a select few who regularly met with Auerbach for lunch almost every week at the China Doll restaurant in Washington (DC). What emerges is a multi-dimensional portrait of Auerbach as revealed by his and others' reminiscences and observations. Feinstein also includes relevant information from his extensive research on Auerbach, the N.B.A., the Boston Celtics teams Auerbach coached, and their opponents.<br /><br />By all accounts, he was a ferocious but highly-principled competitor. Agreeing with Sun Tzu that every battle is won or lost before it is fought, Auerbach drove his carefully selected players hard during the pre-season (and whenever the N.B.A. schedule allowed a practice) but then allowed them to play to their individual talents while insisting that they do so as a team. He expresses contempt for coaches who draw attention to themselves during a game in progress as well as for selfish or lazy players. All of his favorite coaches (notably Dean Smith, Bob Knight, Mike Krzyzewski, and Morgan Wootten) were/are dedicated teachers as well as strict disciplinarians and relentless taskmasters, renowned for developing individual talent while never allowing team integrity to be compromised. It is no coincidence that these same coaches are also among those whose teams have won the most games as well as numerous conference and national championships.<br /><br />Of greatest interest to me are Auerbach's self-revelations, most of which preceded by \\"Did I ever tell you about....?\\" or \\"Let me tell you about....\\" He seems eager to share stories about everyone he has known, with two exceptions: Len Bias, the University of Maryland All-American who died of a drug overdose immediately after being drafted #1 by the Celtics, and, Reggie Smith who was the Celtics captain when dying of a massive heart attack during a pickup game. \\"Both names bring a cloud to his face, a look of sadness. They are, without question, the two most tragic figures in the history of the Celtics.\\" Feinstein provides a wealth of information about the sad circumstances in Chapter 8, \\"Dark Days.\\"<br /><br />Auerbach continues to have many close friends and countless admirers, not only in basketball or even in the sports world but throughout almost all elements of American society. For whatever reasons (Feinstein suggests several), he retains a certain mystique...especially for those who recall all the great Celtics teams and their N.B.A. Hall of Famers which include Auerbach; also Bob Cousy, John Havlicek, Tom Heinsohn, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Frank Ramsey, Bill Russell, and Bill Sharman.<br /><br />Perhaps Auerbauch's closest personal friend in the media, the Boston Globe's Will McDonough offers these comments about him. \\"First, he's smarter than you, he's smarter than me,he's smarter than just about all of us. He's got an amazing feel for people. That's what made him a great coach. People say he had great players. Who do you think chose those players? [Auerbach's Celtic teams won nine league championships in ten years with talent which he fully developed.] Every one of those guys is in the Hall of Fame. But every one of them listened to Red and did whatever he told them they had to do in order to win. That's why he always said that he never `handled' players. He never tried to handle anyone. He was completely honest with them, told them what was expected of them, and gave them a choice: my way or the highway. There was never any ambiguity.\\"<br /><br />Many of us who read this book will be somewhat envious of Feinstein because he was able to have lunch almost every Tuesday with Auerbach and his cronies, privy to what must have been exceptionally lively, often confrontational conversations. But we are also grateful that he shares so much of those conversations as well as much of what was revealed to him during interviews of hundreds of others who also had a close association with Arnold (\\"Red\\") Auerbach, arguably the greatest basketball coach ever and without doubt one of the most interesting human beings I have as yet encountered.got an amazing feel for people.

I think it will also be of substantial interest and value to others who are directly associated with those executives. Viardot carefully organizes his material within these ten chapters:<br /><br />The Meaning of Marketing for High-Tech Firms<br />Corporate and Marketing Strategies in the High-Tech Industry<br />Knowing Customers and Markets<br />Understanding Competitors<br />Selecting Markets<br />Product Strategy<br />Distributing and Selling High-Tech Products<br />Communication Strategy for High-Tech Products<br />Pricing High-Tech Products<br />The Position of Marketing Within High-Tech Companies<br /><br />I have included the chapter titles so as to indicate both how the material is organized and to suggest that what Viardot provides is a cohesive and comprehensive program, one which offers all manner of strategies by which an organization can avoid joining \\"a cemetery full of companies that [incorrectly] thought they could win the world with their innovations.\\" Why did they fail? Because they did not have \\"the marketing ability to connect their innovative offer with the actual needs of the markets.\\" Viardot cites several \\"famous failures\\" of high-tech firms which include EMI, the R&D division of Xerox, and AMD. Why have other companies succeeded? Because they have tended to market two or three times as many new products as their competitors while incorporating two to three times more technical innovations into each new product, thereby bringing actual value to their customers. \\"Also, they introduce their products to the market two times faster than their competitors thanks to operational excellence [which Viardot discusses in Chapter 6], one of the main weaknesses of so many dot-coms that underestimated the importance of manufacturing and logistics.\\" For these companies, marketing is their main objective: the ultimate key to their success and resilience is their ability to \\"determine the needs of the [given] market and to assure that the products manufactured by [them] correspond precisely to these needs with a competitive advantage and at a profit.\\" According to Viardot, companies which demonstrate these attributes include Nokia, IBM, Cisco Systems, Samsung, SAP, Yahoo, Vodaphone, Amazon, and eBay.<br /><br />Thoughtfully, Viardot provides a Summary at the end of each of the ten chapters and then two appendices after the final chapter: \\"[Seven] Key Success Factors of a Marketing Department in a High-Tech Company\\" and \\"The Marketing Plan\\" which includes a \\"SWOT Analysis\\" by which to identify the Strengths and Weaknesses of current marketing strategies, Opportunities and Threats, and issues which must therefore be addressed. According to Viardot, successful high-tech firms must first deliberately define the place of their marketing structure within their entire organization, then design (or redesign) the internal organization of their marketing structure with the utmost attention and care, and finally, optimize the cooperation of the marketing structure with all other departments. Hence the importance of effective internal communication, productive collaboration, and sufficient resources. At all times, senior management must support these initiatives \\"wholeheartedly.\\"<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Marketing As Strategy: Understanding the CEO's Agenda for Driving Growth and Innovation in which, as Philip Kotler notes in the Foreword, Nirmalya Kumar \\"introduces a framework for analyzing and planning marketing strategy in terms of the three Vs: valued customer, value proposition, and value network...[he also] proposes ways to deal with growing commoditization, price pressure, and the increasing market power of global mega-retailers...[as he strives] to show how the marketing discipline 'could become more strategic, cross-functional, and bottom-line oriented' than ever before.\\" As will Viardot's, Kumar's book will be of substantial value to all organizations (regardless of their size and nature) which are in urgent need of driving their growth and innovation. I also highly recommend Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton's  The Strategy-Focused Organization: How Balanced Scorecard Companies Thrive in the New Business Environment.before.\\" As will Viardot's, Kumar's book will be of substantial value to all organizations (regardless of their size and nature) which are in urgent need of driving their growth and innovation.

This volume does indeed provide many of \\"the funniest moments in radio, television, stand-up, and movie comedy.\\" (Obviously, no single volume could provide all of them.) Credit Garner with the quality and scope of the selections; also with the insightful commentaries which accompany an abundance of illustrations. The DVD included,  indifferently co-hosted by Carl and Rob Reiner, contains mostly fragments of comedy routines.<br /><br />The book's material is cleverly organized within three Parts which focus on radio and television, stand-up, and movies, respectively. Garner inserts within each Part what he calls Sidebars. For example \\"Kings of Late Night\\"; \\"The Catskills, Casinos, and the Rise of Stand-Up\\"; and \\"Preston Sturges: Master of the Screwball Comedy.\\" Each reader will have her or his own favorite sections, presumably determined by their favorite comedians. For me, it was a special treat to share Garner's thoughts about the historical significance of certain entertainers and directors in terms of their contributions to the creation and subsequent development of a unique art form. For example, listed in alphabetical order, Fred Allen, Roseanne Barr, Milton Berle, Lenny Bruce, Charles Chaplin, Bill Cosby, Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, the Marx Brothers, Lorne Michaels, Richard Pryor, Hal Roach, Will Rogers, Jerry Seinfeld, Mack Sennett, and Billy Wilder.<br /><br />I also wish to praise Garner for not \\"getting in the way.\\" He avoids doing so by providing a wealth of excerpts from material as it was originally performed. His focus (and ours) is always on the given subject. Among the best excerpts are the Lou Grant (Ed Asner) interview of Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and  \\"Classic Romantic Comedy Repartee: Love and Lust, Wit and Wisdom\\" excerpts from dialogue in classics such as She Done Him Wrong (1933), The Thin Man (1934), and Pillow Talk (1959).<br /><br />My only regret is that no index is provided. Otherwise, this is a brilliantly produced volume which, especially in combination with the DVD, preserves for generations to come so many of the funniest moments in radio, television, stand-up, and movies which would otherwise not be accessible from a single source.

It is important to make a distinction between recreation and competition, both of which can have great value and are most obvious in athletics as well as in the business world. According to Stalk and Lachenauer, \\"Softball players have no competitive advantage or, if they have one, may not know what it is or may be unable to exploit it. Often softballers can drift along for years, finding ways -- through trade loading, for example, or cost cutting -- to stay afloat from quarter to quarter. A few may seek to disguise their poor performance through activities -- such as creating shell customers -- that are questionable, if not illegal. In the parlance of pitching, such companies are throwing junk.\\"<br /><br />The focus of this book is on winners in business who have always played hardball: those who \\"use every legitimate resource and strategy available to them to gain advantage over their competitors...[and by doing so] attract more customers, gain market share, boost profits, reward their employees, and weaken their competitors' positions.\\" Hardballers are wholly committed to winning \\"the game\\" and do so, key point, by always playing by its \\"rules.\\" Their goal is always decisive victory so as to sustain dominance. With regard to social responsibility, it is noteworthy that Stalk and Lachenauer quote Milton Friedman's observation that there is \\"one and only one\\" in business: \\"...to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud.\\"<br /><br />In a company playing hardball, it is the leader's main role to keep alive the quest for competitive advantage and engage everyone else in that quest, constantly maintaining total focus on what Stalk and Lachenauer refer to as \\"the heart of the matter --- a very small set of vital issues whose resolution will determine the future of the organization.\\" Obviously, Stalk and Lachenauer take a no-nonsense approach to playing to win. \\"Sometimes hardball players have to play a little rough and, when they do, they don't apologize for it.\\" It is important to remember that the hardball perspective includes employees as well as customers, vendors, and service providers as well as competitors. Expectations are high and there is zero-tolerance of anything less than a best effort. When creating discomfort for others, hardballers must be willing and able to tolerate it themselves. They know what it means when claiming \\"We mean business.\\" They do.<br /><br />Think about the most successful professional teams such as the Boston Celtics, Pittsburgh Steelers, New York Yankees, and Montreal Canadiens. Members of each of their championship teams made all manner of personal sacrifices to achieve their team's success. I recall Jack Dempsey's comment that \\"champions get up when they can't.\\" The most successful athletic teams are renowned for gaining and then sustaining dominance over an opponent. They work harder and they play smarter. And they always play by the rules, viewing with contempt those who don't. The same is also true of those companies whose names reappear year after year on the annual list of the Fortune 500, most of which also appear on Fortune's annual list of the Most Admired Companies. Not a coincidence.<br /><br />I expect this book to generate a great deal of discussion because Stalk and Lachenauer take a hardball attitude toward their reader: \\"Are you playing to play or playing to win?\\" Hardballers know who they are.

This is a magnificent achievement. Serving as General Editor, Jerry Beck has brought together in a single volume a riveting narrative which examines the history of cartoon, anime, and CGI with stunning full-color illustrations of that history. As he explains in his Introduction, \\"We have assembled an international team of animation authorities to tell the tales behind the toons. -The story is told in chronological sequence with choice images that enhance its history...From popular Disney characters to obscure personal films, it is all covered: Hollywood hits and Japanese anime, as well as Russian masterpieces and Asian artfilms. Looking it over, it is quite a wild ride.\\" Indeed it is. The material is skillfully organized within twelve chapters which range from \\"The Origin of the Art\\" to \\"The New Century.\\" By no means do I claim to be an expert on the subject of animation art but I presume to observe that I cannot imagine what has been left out. The illustrations are stunning; the prose narrative is crisp and lucid.<br /><br />In the Foreword, Jeffrey Katzenberg observes that animation art provides a unique opportunity \\"to remember to know who has gone before, to really know the stories, take lessons from them, and bring that knowledge to the future. My hope is that, one day, other people will feel the same way about about those of us who are making animated films now. While it is an amazing thing to have the opportunity to create films and to bring these enormous enterprises to the world, it is something entirely different and entirely more rare to have our work remembered and considered part of the continuing evolution of an art form.\\" Thanks to Beck, those who work their way through this magnificent volume will not only remember what has been achieved in animation art thus far; they will also understand what can yet be accomplished as others who have yet to reveal themselves through their art.<br /><br />I highly recommend this volume to anyone interested in animation art, of course, but also to those who have an interest in the creation and evolution of comic books. Also to those who share my high regard for illustrators such as Al Hirschfeld whose art is celebrated in Hirschfeld on Line, now available from Amazon in both book and DVD formats.animation art, of course, but also to those who have an interest in the creation and evolution of comic books.

[A substantial majority of colonials did.] To separate from the mother country, he cautioned, was to make 'a leap in the dark,' to jump into an uncertain future.\\" Ferling goes on to note that, indeed, \\"Twenty years before independence, it would have been a leap in the dark for the individual colonies to surrender their autonomy and consent to a national confederation of thirteen provinces or for the imperial government in London to countenance such a union.\\" In this volume, Ferling covers a period of time which extends from the Stamp Act of 1765 until Thomas Jefferson's inauguration as president in 1801.<br /><br />His focus is less on the Revolutionary War itself, more on the immensely complicated, at times confusing political process prior to and following the Declaration of Independence. Those who signed that document fully understood that they were also signing their own death warrant if the subsequent war were lost. It is probably impossible for us today to appreciate the nature and extent of uncertainty for those who resisted British policies, declared independence, went to war against the (then) world's greatest military power, embraced republicanism, ratified the Constitution, enfranchised additional citizens, elected or selected officials who had no prior experience with public service, and cast aside the culture and values of their Anglo-American past. It is this great \\"darkness\\" of peril and ambiguity which Ferling enables his reader to explore.<br /><br />With all due respect to Ferling's comprehensive and compelling erudition, I especially appreciate his writing style with which he brilliantly enlivens the narrative with a mastery of figurative language worthy of a Dickens or Balzac. Without in any sense compromising his primary and secondary sources, he brings to life a society more than 200 years distant from ours and portrays each of its great leaders with style, wit, and grace, to be sure, but also acknowledges their flaws. I have always believed that major historical figures are credible only to the extent that they are presented as human beings rather than as deities. (I think that is especially true of John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and George Washington.) In his final chapter, Ferling's concluding remarks about the election of 1800 also provide what I consider to be an appropriate conclusion to this brief commentary of mine: \\"Thus, the election of 1800 ushered in a revolution 'in the principles of our government as [profound as] that of 1776 was in its form.' The route to this new day was the road chosen by America's patriots in 1776, for they had believed that the 'blessings...necessary to make us a happy and prosperous people' included 'a wise and frugal government' that rejected tyranny and was based on the popular will. The day now had arrived when the government they wished was being installed. Its promise was considerable. Indeed, said President Jefferson, it was 'the world's best hope.'\\" And that remains true in 2004, more than 200 years later.<br /><br />The title of this book may be \\"A Leap in the Dark\\" but it provides, in fact, a thoughtful and sensitive illumination of human potentialities, a vision which continues to guide and inform, indeed nourish our quest for enlightenment.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Ferling's other works, notably Setting the World Ablaze: Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and the American Revolution, John Adams: A Life, Struggle for a Continent: The Wars of Early America (American History Series),  The First of Men: A Life of George Washington, A Wilderness of Miseries: War and Warriors in Early America, and Adams vs. Jefferson: The Tumultuous Election of 1800 (Pivotal Moments in American History).years distant from ours and portrays each of its great leaders with style, wit, and grace, to be sure, but also acknowledges their flaws.

Presumably two of the criteria for determining which articles to include are (a) frequency of reprint requests and (b) significance of the article in relation to the author(s)'s subsequent work. I strongly recommend all of the volumes in the series. The individual titles are listed at this Web site: [...] The authors of various articles are among the world's most highly regarded experts on the given subject. All of the volumes have been carefully edited. An Executive Summary introduces each selection. Supplementary commentaries are also provided in most of the volumes, as is an \\"About the Contributors\\" section which usually includes suggestions of other sources which some readers may wish to explore.<br /><br />In this volume, we are provided with eight previously published articles which, from a variety of perspectives, examine an especially important business subject: How to achieve breakthrough leadership. In the first, Harris Collingwood shares leaders' remembrances of moments and others who have shaped them. The core concepts in the next article, \\"Primal Leadership: The Hidden Driver of Great Performance,\\" were later developed in several books co-authored by Daniel Goleman, Richard Boyatzis, and Annie McKee. Collingwood then reappears as co-moderator with Julia Kirby of a roundtable discussion during which six experts (e.g. Frances Hesselbein who is chairman of the Peter F. Drucker Foundation and Frederick Smith who is chairman and CEO of FedEx. For me, one of the most thought-provoking articles is the one in which Richard S. Tedlow explains why and how \\"a handful of simple principles\\" followed by seven \\"titans of industry\\" (i.e. Carnegie, Eastman, Ford, Noyce, Revson, Walton, and Watson, Sr.) can also be applied by others to achieve breakthrough results. The material in the remaining five articles is also worthy careful consideration. Of course, the value of each article will largely be determined by its reader's own interests and (especially) needs.<br /><br />I have read and reviewed almost all of the volumes which comprise the \\"Harvard Business Review Paperback Series.\\" This is one of the best but the same benefits are offered by all of the others: Cutting-edge ideas which can have the greatest impact for about 30% of the cost, were the articles ordered separately as reprints. Better yet, they are grouped by common business topic but their authors approach that topic from significantly different perspectives. Most executives should own and then read all of the volumes in this series.

It is important to keep in mind that when he met with Drucker, Collins was only 36 years of age and \\"with no significant reputation.\\" Nonetheless, Drucker treated him with kindness as well as respect. \\"His generosity of spirit [then and now] explains much of Drucker's immense influence.\\" Collins reflected on Drucker's admonition to replace the quest for success with the quest for contribution. \\"The critical question is not `How can I achieve?' but `What can I contribute?'\\" Before parting, in fact, Drucker told Collins, \\"I have learned much from our conversation today\\" and he obviously meant it. Although widely referred to as a \\"guru,\\" Drucker has always viewed himself as a student. His intellectual curiosity is apparently insatiable. Also his desire to continue to be of service, to add to his contributions as the leading founder of the field of management, as the most influential management thinker in the second half of the twentieth century, and as the founding father of the Peter F. Drucker Graduate School of Management.<br /><br />What we have here is an anthology of 366 brief excerpts from Drucker's 35 books and countless articles. In the Preface, Drucker explains that \\"the most important part of this book is the blank spaces at the bottom of its pages. They are what the readers will contribute, their actions, decisions and the results of these decisions. [Drucker then adds the following assertion, italicized to indicate the importance he attaches to it.] For this is an action book.\\" He then acknowledges a debt of gratitude to his longtime friend and colleague, professor Joseph A. Maciariello, who assisted with the selection and organization of the material. For example, the items assembled in the January section range from \\"Integrity in Leadership\\" to \\"A Functioning Society.\\" Each of the 31 selections begins with an appropriate quotation, followed by an excerpt and then an ACTION POINT. The same format is employed for each of the other 335 selections throughout the book.<br /><br />Here is a more enlightening example, provided for April 21. Quotation: \\"If we didn't spend four hours on placing a man and placing him right, we'd spend four hundred hours on cleaning up after our mistake.\\" (Alfred Sloan). The excerpt which follows is taken from Drucker's autobiography, Adventures of a Bystander, and creates a context for Sloan's observation. In this instance, Drucker was astonished by the fact that the senior executives at General Motors spent what he considered  \\"a disproportionate amount of time\\" discussing the work and assignment of a position \\"way down the line.\\" As for the ACTION POINT, \\"Make decisions on people -- selection, placement, and evaluation -- your top priority.\\" The reader is also provided with an extensively annotated Bibliography and a comprehensive list of \\"Readings by Topic.\\" Re the latter, for example,  the subject \\"New Realities\\" is discussed in excerpts assigned to February 1,2,5,7; March 25-27; May 1-9, 12-19, and 28; and August 28.

Those who have read Lipman-Blumen's previously published Connective Leadership and/or Hot Groups can correctly assume that she again offers brilliant insights, eloquently expressed, in her newest book. She responds to two especially interesting questions: \\"Why do so many people follow destructive bosses and corrupt politicians?\\" and \\"How can we survive them?\\" In fairness both to her and to those who have not as yet read this book, I will resist the temptation to reveal what her responses are. However, I hope the remarks which follow create sufficient interest in this book because it eminently deserves and richly rewards a careful reading.<br /><br />She organizes her material within Four Parts: The Big Picture (Chapter 1) in which she explains why toxic leaders are so plentiful; Leaders, Leaders, Why Do We All Want Leaders? (Chapters 2-6) in which she examines psychological needs, angst and illusions (e.g. about life, death, and immortality), global instabilities, creation of potentially dangerous deities, and the urge for heroic men and women; How [and Why] We Create Willing Followers and Toxic Leaders (Chapters 7-9) in which she discusses various myths which help to explain the appeal of toxic leaders and the rejection of non-toxic leaders; and finally, Liberating Ourselves from the Allure of Toxic Leaders (Chapters 10-13) in which Lipman-Blumen proposes a number of mindsets, values, strategies, tactics, and initiatives which can -- at least in some instances -- protect mankind from toxic leaders or expedite their loss of power and even influence.<br /><br />In this volume, Lipman-Blumen demonstrates all of the highly-developed skills of a world-class cultural anthropologist whose cutting-edge thinking about effective leadership and productive teamwork has earned for her the eminence she now enjoys. In my opinion, she has far greater and much more challenging ambitions in this book than she did in either of the two which preceded it. Consider this brief excerpt from the first chapter: Toxic leaders \\"first charm but then manipulate, mistreat, undermine, and ultimately leave their followers worse off than when they found them. Yet many of these followers hang on. I do not speak merely of the leader's immediate entourage -- the leader's close-in staff and advisors. I am speaking also of the larger mass of supporters (employees, constituents, volunteers) who only glimpse their toxic leader through a glass darkly -- perchance through a window of the executive suite or on the television screen. More surprisingly perhaps, even those groups charged with keeping leaders under the microscope and on the straight and narrow -- the media and boards of directors -- fall under they sway.\\"<br /><br />How to explain the \\"allure\\" of toxic leaders? How do they sustain, if not increase their domination of others? Even when exposed as toxic leaders, why do they continue to retain so many loyal followers? Realistically, to what extent (if any) can one individual or even a group remove such leaders from their positions of dominance? These and other questions have intrigued me for decades. Although I do not agree with all of Lipman-Blumen's opinions, I appreciate the rigor with which she has formulated those opinions.<br /><br />To me, the book's most thought-provoking and thus most valuable material is provided in Part III, with the relatively weakest material following in Part IV. Lipman-Blumen is at her best when examining, indeed explaining how and why mankind creates toxic leaders as well as their willing followers. She is much less effective, in my opinion, when offering advice as to how to avoid or respond to the allure of such leaders. For example, is a coup or assassination the only effective solution to a tyrant? In a business context, what if a toxic leader is the owner/CEO of a small company? Realistically, is there any viable choice other than leaving? Lipman-Blumen's difficulties with the material in Part IV were probably inevitable...and have nothing to do with her intelligence, sensitivity, street smarts, and frame-of-reference. With all due respect to the \\"lessons\\" she reviews (please see pages 206-215) and the five strategies she then recommends (please see pages 238-249), I think those difficulties are explained, rather, by flaws in human nature which some have traced back to the Garden of Eden. Historically, those whom toxic leaders manipulate, mistreat, undermine, betray, and ultimately leave worse off than before are victims. Those who support toxic leaders are willing accomplices. Those who oppose toxic leaders are heroic. Those among them who are destroyed by toxic leaders are martyrs. For me, the most important question Lipman-Blumen poses in this book is hardly original: \\"Who are you?\\" For each reader, the answer will not be found in this book.  However, a careful reading of it can assist with completing that immensely difficult journey of self-discovery.<br /><br />I also highly recommend Crucial Confrontations: Tools for Resolving Broken Promises, Violated Expectations, and Bad Behavior co-authored by Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzler.evitable...and have nothing to do with her intelligence, sensitivity, street smarts, and frame-of-reference.

As I read this exceptionally informative book, I was again reminded of the fact that the Chinese word for \\"crisis\\" has two meanings: peril and opportunity. Since posting the review, a reader's comment (please see below) identifies an essay that brings into doubt the common belief in the dual meaning to which I referred. However,  I remain convinced, linguistic issues aside, that every crisis does pose both peril or opportunity and that how we respond is for us to determine.<br /><br />*  *  *<br /><br />As those who have been or are now involved in process simplification initiatives already know, every problem encountered offers a valuable learning opportunity. The same is also true when encountering \\"broken promises, violated expectations, and bad behavior\\" either within or beyond the workplace. The authors of this volume address questions such as these:<br /><br />What's a \\"crucial confrontation\\"?<br />What to do before one occurs?<br />How to know when -- and when NOT -- to initiate one?<br />How to \\"get your head  right before opening your mouth\\"?<br />How to begin a crucial confrontation?<br />How to involve and engage others to take appropriate action?<br />How to make keeping commitments (almost) painless?<br />What to do when others \\"get sidetracked, scream, or sulk\\"?<br />What to do after a crucial confrontation?<br />How to gain commitment and move to action?<br />How to solve \\"big, sticky, complicated problems\\"?<br />How to deal with the truly tough? (i.e. the twelve \\"yeh buts\\")<br /><br />The authors also provide four appendices: A self-assessment for measuring  confrontation skills, \\"The Six-Source Model,\\" \\"When Things Go Right,\\" and discussion questions for reading groups. Although any one of the appendices is worth far more than the cost of this book, their greatest value will be derived when the information and counsel are correlated with the material which the authors share in the nine chapters.<br /><br />My own experience in the business world suggests that \\"broken promises, violated expectations, and bad behavior\\" really do offer both perils and opportunities. A careful reading of this book and then an equally careful application of the advice which the authors offer will, in my opinion, help reduce (if not eliminate) the former while helping to achieve effective fulfillment of the latter.y do offer both perils and opportunities.

As George Burns noted, they were not hungry for recognition; they were hungry for food. They did not question their humor but rather just recognized and used it. Nevertheless, the roles comedians played and most particularly the contributions of Eastern European Jewish culture shaped the personalities of these comedians and lay, either hidden or not, in their minds.\\" I then explain that, for me, a Gentile, it is impossible to determine to what extent Jewish comedy became assimilated within American society, and, to what extent Jewish comedy helped American society became assimilated with Jewish values. My suggestion then and now is that we call it a tie and consider ourselves that much the better for it.<br /><br />In this volume, Epstein focuses his attention on \\"America's love affair with comedy teams from Burns and Allen to Belushi and Aykroyd\\" as he explains how and why the greatest comedy teams became so popular in films, on radio, and then on television. Sharing much in common with marriages, not all comedy teams survived (e.g. Martin and Lewis) whereas many of those which did succeeded despite significant differences between the partners. Epstein suggests that these differences help to explain the appeal of Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers, Abbott and Costello, the Three Stooges, and Hope and Crosby. I especially appreciate Epstein's insights concerning George Burns and Gracie Allen. Early on, Burns realized that -- contrary to his prior background and training -- audiences required him to be her straight man, feeding her carefully crafted cues. Indeed, most of the great comedy teams demonstrate this symbiotic relationship between \\"an authority figure\\" and a \\"rebellious spirit.\\" The former was not necessarily one of the team's partners. For Laurel and Hardy, Jimmy Finlayson served that purpose as did Margaret Dumont for the Marx Brothers (especially for Groucho) and Audrey Meadows (Alice) for Jackie Gleason (Ralph) and Art Carney (Ed). True, over time, traditional comedy teams seem to have lost much of their appeal, as have stand-up comics. However, as Epstein notes, there was \\"the uncharted course of their enduring afterlife, reflected in such forms as contemporary situation comedies\\" which include M*A*S*H, the Mary Tyler Moore Show, Cheers, Friends, and Frasier.<br /><br />For Epstein, the essence of a team is suggested by the following exchange between the Crane brothers:<br /><br />Frasier: Dinner?<br /><br />Niles: Perfect. No place fancy, I'm sure neither of us wants a heavy meal with lots of wine and expensive desserts.<br /><br />Frasier: Oh, it's your turn to pay, isn't it?<br /><br />Niles: You know me so well.<br /><br />All of the great comedy teams knew each other so well. As Epstein explains, \\"It is a feeling all of us need, and that is why we will continue to treasure the enduring contributions of comedy teams. They, after all, created characters that reflected our private dreams, suppressed longings, and most bedeviling fears. And, most importantly, as we remember their routines and their friendships, we find ourselves laughing.\\"<br /><br />This is a brilliant and eloquent as well as highly entertaining book which enables its reader to increase substantially her or his understanding and appreciation of the great comedy teams. As I read the final chapter, I felt like Charles Chipping (\\"Mr. Chips\\") who, in his imagination, is re-visited by all the boys whom he had taught throughout his career at Brookfield. Thanks to Lawrence Epstein, I have been able to reconnect with so many beloved entertainers whose talents enriched my life in ways and to an extent I am unable to express now.'s partners.

In fact, Kumar provides a unique and compelling analysis of the interdependence of marketing and strategy. As Philip Kotler notes In the Foreword,  Kumar \\"introduces a framework for analyzing and planning marketing strategy in terms of the three Vs': valued customer, value proposition, and value network...[he also] proposes ways to deal with growing commoditization, price pressure, and the increasing market power of global mega-retailers...[as he strives] to show how the marketing discipline `could become more strategic, cross-functional, and bottom-line oriented' than ever before.\\" This book will be of substantial value to all organizations (regardless of their size and nature) which are in urgent need of driving their growth and innovation.<br /><br />Kumar carefully organizes his material within eight chapters whose titles indicate what each covers  such as From Market Segments to Strategic Segments (for me, the most valuable chapter in this book) and From Branded Bulldozers to Global Distribution Partners (a chapter which will probably be of greatest interest to small-to-midsize companies with strategic alliances with global corporations). I agree with Peter Drucker's assertion that  \\"the business enterprise has two and only two basic functions: marketing and innovation produce results; all the rest are costs.\\" I also agree with Warren Buffett who suggested that price is what is charged for whatever is sold; value is what the buyer thinks it's worth. As Kumar observes in the final chapter, \\"Marketing must prove that it is willing and ready for its leadership role in transforming the company. It must convince others of its unique capabilities, resources and skills, and its mind-set to lead -- and that it has matured as a discipline to become [as noted by Kotler] more strategic, cross-functional, and bottom-line oriented.\\"<br /><br />This book helps its reader to understand \\"the strategic marketplace challenges that all CEOs face today,\\" an obhective which is especially important now when CEOs seek strategic leadership from marketers inorder to exploit new business opportunities, build strong brand and customer franchises, increase the organization's overall customer responsiveness, redefine industry distribution channels, enhance global effectiveness, and reduce such risks as industry price pressures. As Kumar suggests, \\"It is about marketers doing better things rather than simply doing things better.\\" For whatever reasons (Kumar suggests several), those responsible for marketing seldom aspire to lead major transformational projects that involve cross-functional, multi-national teams sponsored by the CEO. In this volume, Kumar offers what he calls \\"The CEO's Marketing Manifesto\\" (please see Figure 1.1 on page 9) which can guide and inform transformational marketing initiatives. Indeed, his entire book coiuld well serve as an operations manual for such initiatives.<br /><br />Well-done!strategic, cross-functional, and bottom-line oriented.\\"     This book helps its reader to understand \\"the strategic marketplace challenges that all CEOs face today,\\" an obhective which is especially important now when CEOs seek strategic leadership from marketers inorder to exploit new business opportunities, build strong brand and customer franchises, increase the organization's overall customer responsiveness, redefine industry distribution channels, enhance global effectiveness, and reduce such risks as industry price pressures.

In this volume, he rigorously examines \\"five strategic arts,\\"  devoting a separate chapter to each of the five, focusing on those organizations and individuals that best illustrate the values which Sun Tzu affirmed more than 2,500 years ago. Here they are: The Art of Possibility (Medtronic, Grameen Bank, and Southwest Airlines), The Art of Timing (Royal Dutch/Shell, Intel, and Southwest Airlines again), The Art of Leverage (Wal-Mart, Dell, and yes, Southwest Airlines again), The Art of Mastery (Singapore, the U.C.L.A. Bruins men's basketball team, and indeed Southwest Airlines again), and finally, The Art of Leadership (Coach John Wooden of U.C.L.A, Earl Bakken who co-founded Medtronic, and of course, Herb Kelleher of Southwest Airlines). When discussing his primary objective for JetBlue Airlines, CEO David Neeleman replied that he and his crewmembers (not employees nor even associates) were determined to \\"bring humanity back to air travel.\\" That is one of Yeh's key points in this book. He insists that the best organizations \\"have a soul and they find a way to make a profit consistently, while also serving the community.\\" That was a lesson which Neeleman learned during his brief association with Southwest Airlines. It is no coincidence that year after year, the companies identified by Fortune magazine as being \\"The Most Admired\\" are also the most profitable in their respective industries.<br /><br />What sets this book apart from so many others which have addressed many of the same issues is the fact that in it Yeh brilliantly correlates and sometimes blends Eastern and Western concepts of business success and personal fulfillment. Not only organizations but each of those within those organizations has a soul and must find (or be provided with) a way to achieve financial success while also serving the community. In essence, the \\"art of business\\" is really the art of having standard of living and quality of life in proper balance. The greatest leaders throughout human history have helped others to do so. Hence the importance of having VPV: vision, purpose, and values.  A great leader inspires others with a vision and mobilizes them to pursue a shared future (the Art of Possibility); she or he initiates or responds effectively to change, especially to a crisis (the Arts of Timing, Leverage, and Mastery); and he or she can innovate constantly because values-driven leadership has developed and nourished both talent and integrity throughout the entire organization (the Art of Leadership).<br /><br />According to Yeh, in addition to having a soul which creates meaning for its people, a great organization must also \\"know where it is going and somehow always seem to [in italics] flow with the changing world, arriving at its destiny in perfect synchrony. A great organization cleverly [in italics] leverages everything in its environment, including competitors, to effectively and efficiently utilize its resources. It is also the [in italics] master of its trade, constantly treading on the leading edge while maintaining effective balance. Finally, a great organization is made of [in italics] leaders who help to actualize the organization's vision by aligning their dreams to it.\\"  Long ago, Isaac Newton explained his own exceptional foresight by noting that he had been able to stand atop the \\"shoulders of giants.\\" Today's great leaders are those upon whose shoulders others will be privileged to stand in years to come.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Sun Tzu: The New Translation by J.

This is a complicated subject in that, as recent research clearly indicates, many of these same products and services also appeal to less affluent consumers. This is precisely what Michael Silverstein and Neil Fiske discuss in Trading Up: The New American Luxury in which they refer to \\"products and services which possess higher levels of quality, taste, and [key word] aspiration than [other] goods in the [same] category but are not so expensive as to be out of reach...[trading up to products and services which] sell at much higher prices than conventional goods and in much higher volumes than traditional luxury goods and, as a result, have soared into previously uncharted territory high above the familiar price-volume demand curve.\\" According to Nunes and Johnson, what is needed  is \\"an approach that considers the facts about mass affluence and delivers a comprehensive view of how companies can change their marketing strategies to capture the value created from greater consumer affluence. That is why we wrote this book; that's what we're attempting to provide.\\"<br /><br />Indeed they do, and with discipline and eloquence. Their material is carefully organized within four Parts: The New Rules of Positioning, The New Rules of Designing Offerings, The New Rules of Customer Reach, and then a final section which responds to the question \\"What's Next?\\" Then in their Epilogue,  Nunes and Johnson share their observations and suggestions with regard to \\"Reenvisioning an Industry\\" (i.e. the jewelry and watch business), applying to it the \\"seven new rules of mass marketing\\" previously introduced and discussed in the first chapter.<br /><br />Long ago, Warren Buffett suggested that price is what we charge and value is what the buyer thinks it's worth. I was reminded of that as I read Part One in which Nunes and Johnson explain \\"The New Rules of Marketing.\\" These are not their rules nor are they even rules per se. Rather, they are strategies which the competitive marketplace has already determined are more appropriate to new realties. For example:<br /><br />Old Rule: Avoid middle-market positions between low-cost and premium.<br /><br />New Rule: Seize the new-middle-ground position, above the rest of the conventional offerings and below the ultrapremium solutions. (Please see Figure 2-1 on page 33.)<br /><br />Old Rule: Produce less-expensive versions of luxuries to sell to the masses.<br /><br />New Rule: Introduce new models of ownership that make a wealthy lifestyle, and even real luxuries, affordable to the masses.<br /><br />According to Nunes and Johnson, traditional mass marketers can \\"play by the new rules\\" (i.e. can capture the spending of the moneyed masses) without sacrificing the former core mass market. How? Give customers the chance to spend more by offering new premium versions, adding on product upgrades and differentiated service levels to existing offerings. Also,  honor customers with the recognition they desire by creating status levels that richly reward willing-to-spend customers in all of the ways they wish to be recognized. Also, offer the right price to each customer by using effective pricing to achieve differential margins based on qualities that aren't intrinsic to the offering. Customers may not always be right but, ultimately, their perceptions ARE market realities. They are asking different kinds of questions now. For example, \\"What does this [watch, handbag, dress, set of golf clubs, etc.] say about me?\\" Moreover, they are less concerned about a luxury item's purchase price than they are about ROI which includes enhanced self-esteem in their own eyes as well as in others'. New realities do indeed require different (if not \\"new\\") strategies by which to respond to them.Nunes and Johnson offer several in this book, anchoring each within a context of relevant information and appropriate examples.

I especially enjoyed reading it because most of these experts draw upon experiences outside of the United States. True, core concepts have global relevance but strategies and tactics to create, increase, and leverage brand equity necessarily vary from one marketplace to another. For example, Sameena Ahmad discusses \\"Globalisation and brands\\" (Chapter 11), Kim Faulkner examines \\"Branding in South-East Asia\\" (Chapter 13), and Simon Anholt offers some valuable insights concerning \\"Branding places and nations\\" (Chapter 14). As Patrick Barwise correctly notes in the Preface, if top managers are becoming brand stewards, they must address issues such as:<br /><br />*  Brand measurement, accountability, and understanding<br />*  Brand support<br />*  The brand owner's social and ethical stance<br />*  Making the experience of buying and using brand consistently deliver on the promises made for it<br /><br />Re this last issue, there is often a substantial gap between promises and performance, especially insofar as service brands are concerned. Hence the importance of eliminating that gap and thereby earn and then sustain consumer trust through performance of the highest possible quality. Once again I am reminded of Warren Buffett's observation that price is what we charge for what we sell but value is what a customer thinks it's worth. The experts whose counsel is included in this volume can, together, help their shared reader to gain a better understanding of issues such as those cited previously as well as (in Barwise's words) \\"the social and financial value of brands, current best practice in branding, and some of the emerging issues around this important, complex, and ever fascinating topic.\\"<br /><br />Among the countless value-added benefits provided in this book are various checklists which are included within several of the individual essays. For example, those which suggest the financial uses of brand valuation (page 43), methodologies for brand positioning (page 81), conclusions which can be made about visual and verbal identity and their relationship to brands in the future (pages 125-126), and questions to be addressed insofar as brand protection is concerned (page 168) as well as a recap of the main themes and arguments previously provided in previous chapters (pages 227-229).

LTG warned that humanity might have to divert much capital and manpower to battle these constraints -- possibly so much that the average quality of life would decline sometime during the twenty-first century.\\" Then in 1992, the authors conducted a 20-year update of their original study and published the results in Beyond the Limits. \\"In BTL we studied global developments between 1970 and 1990 and used the information to update the LTG and the World3 computer model. BTL repeated the same message: In 1992 we concluded that two decades of history mainly supported the conclusions we had advanced 20 years earlier.\\"<br /><br />However, BTL (1992) offered one new finding: \\"...humanity had already overshot the limits of Earth's support capacity. This fact was so important that we chose to reflect it in the title of the book.\\" If you have not already read one or both of the two earlier volumes, these brief excerpts from the Authors' Preface to Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update will suggest a context within which to understand and appreciate the significance of what Meadows, Randers, and Meadows share in this third volume.<br /><br />If I understand their key point, it is this: Humanity's consumption of Earth's resources (i.e. humanity's \\"ecological footprint\\") proceeds at an increasingly faster rate than Earth's available resources can accommodate (i.e. its \\"carrying capacity\\"). There must be prudent physical growth constraints on consumption in combination with replenishment of the Earth's resources. Otherwise, over time, \\"the world will experience overshoot and collapse in global resource use and emissions.\\"<br /><br />The authors clearly identify the global challenge (page xv), explain their reasons for writing this update (pages xviii and xix) in response to that challenge, and then conclude their Preface with the prediction that \\"it will take another decade before the consequences of [global ecological] overshoot are clearly observable and two decades before the fact of overshoot is generally acknowledged.\\" They intend to provide another update in 2012, on the 40th anniversary of their first book.<br /><br />In the 14 chapters which follow, Meadows, Randers, and Meadows explain why it is not only desirable but indeed imperative to<br /><br />1. increase the consumption levels of the world's poor<br /><br />2. reduce humanity's total ecological footprint<br /><br />3. support technological advances (e.g. to achieve #1)<br /><br />4. support personal change (e.g. to achieve #2)<br /><br />5. think in terms of longer planning horizons<br /><br />The authors offer a range of alternative scenarios (i.e. ten different \\"pictures\\" of how the 21st century may evolve) to encourage their reader's learning, reflection and personal choice. For me, Chapter 7 is especially valuable. Based on their structural analysis of the world, they offer seven general guidelines to expedite transitions to sustainability: extent the planning horizon (#5 previously), improve the \\"signals\\" (i.e. early-warning system for global ecology), speed up the response time to ecological crises, minimize use of nonrenewable resources, prevent the erosion of renewable resources, use all resources with maximum efficiency, and slow -- and eventually stop -- exponential growth of population and physical capital.<br /><br />In the final chapter, Meadows, Randers, and Meadows briefly discuss the agricultural and industrial revolutions and then assert that the next revolution should respond to the need for sustainability of humanity on Earth. They share their vision of the sustainable society which such a revolution could achieve and even provide a (\\"by no means definitive\\") list of its dominant characteristics, urging their reader to develop it further. I agree with the authors that a sustainable world \\"can never be fully realized until it is widely imagined.\\" Hence the importance of their (\\"by no means definitive\\") list...hence the even greater importance of having as many other people as possible also imagine precisely what kind of a world they would much prefer to live in.<br /><br />There are obviously limits to how much of Earth's resources can be consumed or corrupted, without replenishment or purification, before they are significantly depleted and eventually exhausted. However, I believe that almost all limits on human imagination are self-imposed. If so, then there should be no limits on our collaborative efforts to reduce \\"humanity's ecological footprint\\" to achieve global sustainability of our precious natural resources if we can but summon and then (yes) sustain sufficient resolve to do so.further.

Its ideology is distinctive and it has a well-defined and committed community. It enjoys exclusive devotion (that is, not shared with another brand in the same category), and its members often become voluntary advocates.\\" A cult brand attracts certain customers for a variety of reasons and rewards them in a variety of ways but it is important to keep in mind that few brands possess the power to do so. Also, that a cult brand is not necessarily a consumer product nor even a physical object. It can also be a uniquely enjoyable experience (e.g. Starbucks) or even a way of life (Harley-Davidson). Atkin is convinced (and I agree) that the same dynamics are at play behind the attraction to brands and cults: Both offer membership in a community of shared values and interests, both give unique and satisfying personal identify, and both inspire uncommon loyalty.<br /><br />According to Atkin, what he characterizes as the \\"cult paradox dynamic\\" is best understood in terms of a four-step process:<br /><br />\\"1. An individual might have a feeling of [in italics] difference, even [in italics] alienation from the world around them.<br /><br />2. This leads to [in italics] openness or to [in italics] searching for a more compatible environment.<br /><br />3. They are likely to feel a sense of [in italics] or [in italics] safety in a place where one's difference from the outside world is seen as a virtue, not a handicap.<br /><br />4. This presents the circumstances for [in italics] self-actualization within a group of like-minded others who celebrate the individual for being himself.\\"<br /><br />Atkin asserts that the same paradox can be found at the heart of cult brands. Rather than joining others inorder to conform, people do so to express, indeed to affirm their individuality. Apple is only one of several companies which have cleverly leveraged the feelings associated with the cult paradox to elevate its brand to cult status: alienation and rejection, followed by validation that in turn sets the stage for self-actualization.<br /><br />If your organization does not now have a cult brand or one which has the potential to become one, why read this book? Good question. Here are three reasons which I presume to offer. First, Atkin can help you to increase your understanding of human motivation. Who among those (non-customers) who purchase what you sell now feel alienated? Why? To which of their unmet needs can you respond? Second, Atkin can help you to develop a marketing plan which creates or increases market demand for what you offer. How can you position your brand so as to differentiate it from its competition? Of equal importance, how can you differentiate a customer's relationship with you from relationships with your competitors? Third and finally, Atkin can help you to formulate and then implement a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective plan by which to develop a sense of evangelism throughout as well as beyond your organization.<br /><br />To this third point, Atkin identifies and then rigorously examines what he calls \\"Principles of the Primacy of the Person\\" in Chapter Three. In this context, I am reminded of what Herb Kelleher once said during a conversation with David Neeleman, then working for Southwest Airlines and currently CEO of JetBlue. \\"I don't care about my shareholders.\\" Neeleman was shocked. What did he mean? Was Kelleher really serious? \\"Because I just take care of my employees. I know if I take care of my employees, they'll take care of my customers, and my customers will take care of my shareholders.\\" Long before Neeleman went to work for Southwest Airlines, Kelleher once observed \\"You can get the same airplane. You can get the same ticket counters.  You can get the same computers. But the hardest thing for a competitor to match is your culture and the spirit of your people and their focus on customer service because that isn't something you can do overnight and it isn't something you can do without a great deal of attention every day in a thousand different ways. That is why I say that our employees are our competitive protection.\\" This is precisely what Atkin has in mind when explaining each of the \\"Principles of the Primacy of the Person.\\"<br /><br />In the final chapter of this book, he reviews the most important principles of cult formation which, in my opinion, are relevant to literally any human community, whatever its size and nature may be. I conclude these brief remarks with a few observations of my own. Warren Buffet once said that price is what you charge for what you sell but value is what the customer thinks it's worth. Only the marketplace can determine which are cult brands and which are not. Beware of the \\"Field of Dreams Syndrome.\\" Be prepared to accept and (yes) celebrate the fact that your organization -- rather than any product or service it offers -- may well prove to be your most powerful brand. Finally, if you are not a \\"true believer\\" in the integrity of your own enterprise, find another.you can do overnight and it isn't something you can do without a great deal of attention every day in a thousand different ways.

They are indeed \\"concise and thorough accounts,\\" as Brinkley and Dyer suggest in their Preface, but they also attempt to do more than that. \\"They are deliberately and frankly interpretative, offering assessments of the individual men and of both great and small events. They are also, in varying degrees, contextual, situating presidents in their time and suggesting how the character of American society and culture shaped the character of presidential performance.\\"<br /><br />No doubt each reader will take issue with at least some of the interpretations such as Herbert Sloan's re George Washington, Michael McGerr's re Theodore Roosevelt, and Matthew Dickinson's re Bill Clinton. Fair enough. Lively, sometimes hostile disagreements still continue concerning Thomas Jefferson almost 180 years after his death. Of greatest interest to me are the chapters devoted to presidents about whom, previously, I knew little (if anything). For example, Martin Van Buren, Franklin Pierce, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, and Warren G. Harding. Being a compulsive highlighter of key passages in the books I read, I also enjoyed comparing and contrasting revealing information about various presidents in terms of the process by which they were elected, the challenges each faced upon taking office, how they responded to those challenges, and what the presidential historians now view (in retrospect) as their most significant contributions.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this volume are urged to check out Sidney M. Milkis and Michael Nelson's The American Presidency: Origins and Development, 1776-2000, Thomas E. Cronin and Michael A.

Some of the statistics he shares about that organization are truly impressive:<br /><br />* In 2004, it plans to open a new store each and every day of the year.<br /><br />* Wal*Mart employs more people in the U.S. than any organization other than the federal government.<br /><br />* 1.3 million associates worldwide make Wal*Mart the largest employer on earth<br /><br />* Over two million associates will work for Wal*Mart worldwide by 2005.<br /><br />* Over 100 million customers per week cross Wal*Mart thresholds in the U.S.<br /><br />* The company operates distribution centers in 120 communities across the country.<br /><br />* In the near future the company plans to increase its annual sales to close to $500 billion.<br /><br />In his Introduction, Bergdahl explains that one of his purposes in this book is to \\"discuss the realities associated with direct competition with Wal*Mart.\\" He selected the acronym P.O.C.K.E.T.S as a means by which to organize his material: Price, Operations, Culture, Key Item Promotion (KIP), Product, Expenses, Talent, and Service.<br /><br />It is important to keep mind as you read this book, that the global retailing organization which Wal*Mart has obviously become began as a small single store franchise of of the Butler Brothers' Ben Franklin chain (Walton's 5 & 10) in Bentonville (AR) in 1950. Walton soon added a second store in Newport (AR) which was not a Ben Franklin franchise. By 1962, Walton and his brother Bud owned 16 variety stores in Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas. The first Wal*Mart store opened that year. My point is, as with JCPenney with which Wal*Mart shares much in common, over time Sam Walton planted a series of \\"acorns\\" in carefully selected and rigorously nourished \\"soil\\" within which progressively more profitable \\"harvests\\" were produced. In my opinion, it is possible but unlikely that there are other Sam Waltons and James Cash Penneys out there who can duplicate such success.<br /><br />Bergdahl seems to agree, explaining that he initially intended to write a book which shares his \\"perceptions of what it takes to be successful in the Wal*Mart world...uncovering the secrets of Wal*Mart strategies and demonstrating HOW competitors can compete with Wal*Mart and survive.\\" He then realized that, instead, it would be easier to write a book about WHY it would be difficult to do so. That is the book which he wrote.<br /><br />One of this book's most important value-added benefits is derived from the \\"Checklist\\" of key points with which Bergdahl concludes each of the seven chapters in which he examines Wal*Mart's expertise in Price, Operations, Culture, Key Item Promotion (KIP), Product, Expenses, Talent, and Service. For whom will this book be most valuable? Another opinion: Decision-makers in those those companies which are deficient in one or more of the seven core competencies, and, decision-makers those companies which do now or plan to do business with Wal*Mart. Bergdahl can help the former to achieve the desired improvement by using the Wal*Mart organization as a benchmark model by to measure the nature and extent of what must be done. He can help the latter to coordinate, indeed integrate their values, policies, and procedures with those of an organization which has significantly elevated standards of measurement and accountability for organizational performance.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Don Taylor's Up Against the Wal-Marts: How Your Business Can Prosper in the Shadow of the Retail Giant, Adam Morgan's Eating the Big Fish: How Challenger Brands Can Compete Against Brand Leaders, Walton's Sam Walton: Made in America : My Story, Robert Slater's The Wal*Mart Decade: How a New Generation of Leaders Turned Sam Walton's Legacy into the World's #1 Company, and Terri Dougherty's Sam Walton: Department Store Giant (Giants of American Industry).	2004-09-09

However, this really is not what Iansiti and Levien have in mind.) For example, Microsoft and Wal-Mart have a decisive competitive advantage in large measure because they are \\"keystone\\" companies in their respective ecosystems. More specifically,<br /><br />Both \\"of these firms understand that their fate is shared with that of the other members of their business network. Rather than focussing primarily on their internal capabilities (as many of their competitors did), they emphasize the collective properties of the business networks in which they participate, and treat these more like organic [in italics] ecosystems [end italics] than traditional supply chain partners. They understand their individual impact on the health of these ecosystems and the respective impact of ecosystem health on their own performance...[For that reason] \\"a new, holistic approach to strategy is critical to an increasingly broad range of firms in our economy as they face the new set of challenges and responsibilities created by competing in business ecosystems.\\"<br /><br />How? Given the evolution of business ecosystems which are analogous to biological counterparts, organizations today, regardless of their size or nature<br /><br />(1) must decide if they are a keystone or niche \\"player\\" (Please see Part I)<br /><br />(2) then formulate strategies appropriate to that role (Please see Part II)<br /><br />(3) and finally, establish and build on one of three \\"foundations of sustainable performance in a business ecosystem\\" (Please see Part III)<br /><br />\\"Keystone\\" companies such as Microsoft, Wal-Mart, Dell, and eBay create value within their respective ecosystems which is shared with other participants in that system. More specifically, they create high-value, sharable assets; leverage direct customer connections; create and manage physical and information hubs; support uniform information standards; create, package, and share state-of-the-art tools and building blocks for innovation; establish and maintain performance standards; build or acquire financial assets for operating leverage; reduce uncertainty by centralizing and coordinating communication, and reduce complexity by providing powerful platforms.<br /><br />Obviously, few organizations can be (or should even attempt to be) a \\"keystone\\" or \\"dominator\\" company. According to the authors, keystone wannabes tend to pursue two quite different: \\"hub landlords\\" (e.g. Enron) extract as much value as possible from an ecosystem or ecosystem domain without integrating forward to control it whereas \\"hub dominators\\" (e.g. Apple) integrate vertically or horizontally to manage and control an ecosystem or ecosystem domain.  Most organizations will correctly a strategy as a \\"niche\\" player by specializing in capabilities which differentiate them within an ecosystem domain. \\"Niche players are naturally dependent on other businesses. The essential step in defining a good niche strategy is therefore to analyze the firm's ecosystem and map out the characteristics of its key stone and dominator players.\\" (Please see Chapters Six and Seven for a complete explanation of all this.)<br /><br />All organizations involved in a given ecosystem must, of course, rigorously monitor but also take an active role in nourishing that system's health so as to promote and facilitate the leveraging of an enduring and evolving core. However, it remains for keystones to provide both the vision and the leadership needed, especially in response to market design, operation, and competition. They must also facilitate and support integration, innovation, and adaptation within their ecosystem. \\"This is the price that keystones must pay for their privileged position at the hub of a business network and as owners of enduring assets: Keystones [in italics] must [end italics] manage the health of their ecosystems as a key business strategy.  The challenge for each niche player is to decide in which ecosystem to become actively involved with which keystones to be associated in a strategic alliance.<br /><br />I wholly agree with Iansiti and Levien that \\"We are bound together by the nature of the relationships among products, technologies, markets, and innovation. Leveraging these relationships is critical to enhance firm productivity, to protect organizations from disruption, and to enhance their ability to innovate, evolve, and adapt. This means that no firm, product, or technology can be an island: No firm can afford to act alone, and no products can be designed in isolation.\\" Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Christensen, Anthony, and Roth's Seeing What's Next: Using the Theories of Innovation to Predict Industry Change as well as Kaplan and Norton's  The Strategy-Focused Organization: How Balanced Scorecard Companies Thrive in the New Business Environment.e and dominator players.\\" (Please see Chapters Six and Seven for a complete explanation of all this.) <br /> <br />All organizations involved in a given ecosystem must, of course, rigorously monitor but also take an active role in nourishing that system's health so as to promote and facilitate the leveraging of an enduring and evolving core.

By now most decision-makers have realized the truth of the observation (source unknown to me) that \\"you can't manage what you can't measure.\\" However, few of them possess the skills (not the talent nor the desire) to do that well because it requires a solid understanding of how to complete functional analyses, based on theoretical foundations, within frameworks and using methodologies which have practical implications, guided and informed by specific measures even when having to accommodate emerging trends and issues. Re-read that last sentence and you have within it an explanation of how the material in this volume is so carefully organized.<br /><br />In my opinion, any one of the essays (all by itself) is worth far more than the cost of the book but I strong recommend that it be read within the sequence of the essays which begins with \\"Measurement perspective: The accounting perspective\\" (David Otley) and concludes with \\"Measuring eBusiness Performance (Neely, Bernard Marr, Chris Adams, and Neha Kapashi) because, although the essays focus on a specific component of business performance measurement, they are interdependent in much the same ways that a 1,000-piece picture puzzle are. Also, there are recurring themes, core concepts, and points of emphasis which an astute reader can -- and must -- correlate.<br /><br />The reader's next challenge is to determine the nature and extent of HOW this wealth of information and counsel can be effectively implemented within her or his own organization. Hence the importance of the four essays which comprise Part IV: \\"What really goes on in the name of benchmarking?\\" (David Mayle, Matthew Hinton, Graham Francis, and Jacky Holloway), \\"Measuring market performance: Which way is up?\\" (Tim Ambler and Flora Kokkinaki), \\"Loosely coupled performance measurement systems\\" (Thomas Ahrens and Chris Chapman), and \\"Redefining Government performance\\" (Ken Ogata and Rich Goodkey). Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book? In one respect, my first reply is any decision-maker within any organization (regardless of size or nature) who currently lacks the skills to conduct accurate and appropriate business performance measurement.<br /><br />However, I am inclined to suggest that senior-level executives will find the material most valuable. In recent years, when working with the CEOs of a variety of different corporate clients, those to whom I have recommended this book, their tendency is to purchase multiple copies and then ask their COO to focus (at least initially) on all of Part I, directing their CFO to Chapters 1, 4, and 18 and their head of marketing to Chapters 2, 4, and 14. Make no mistake about it: This is a daunting book which deserves, indeed requires but will generously reward more than one careful reading and frequent re-visits. For me, Chapter 10 is one of the most thought-provoking because Elsbeth Murray and Peter Richardson explain the importance of those whom they characterize as \\"the critical few [who are] first among equals as parameters of strategic effectiveness.\\" Of course, other readers will find other chapters of greater interest and value. Fair enough.<br /><br />I hope these brief remarks have helped those for whom they were written to gain a sense of what this volume offers to them. Caveat redux.

(FYI, Peter Schwartz in The Art of the Long View: Planning for the Future in an Uncertain World and Kees van der Heijden in Scenarios: The Art of Strategic Conversation also have much of substantial value to say about that process.) Together with Erik A. Roth and Scott D. Anthony, Clayton M. Christensen offers in this volume further development of core concepts previously discussed in The Innovator's Dilemma and The Innovator's Solution. However, there is a substantial amount of new thinking and an abundance of new material. Although I strongly recommend that the two earlier works be read first, that is not a requirement to derive full benefit from Seeing What's Next.<br /><br />According to Christensen, \\"While the two previous books were aimed at managers [in italics] inside firms who wanted to defend again or attack with a disruption, Seeing What's Next is written for those who watch industries from the [in italics] outside, and who must make important decisions based on what they see. It will help executives, analysts, investors, and others who have a stake in a specific industry to evaluate the impact of innovations, the outcomes of competitive battles, and the moves made by individual firms -- and to make smarter business decisions, forecasts, and stock recommendations based on those evaluations. The goal here [in Seeing What's Next] is to dramatically increase the odds of getting things right in the arena where wrong decisions could be devastating.\\"<br /><br />The authors carefully organize their material as follows:<br /><br />In Part I, \\"How to Use Theory to Analyze,\\" they identify the \\"signals of change\\" which indicate where the best opportunities are; explain how to size up competitors; how to identify which strategic choices are of greatest importance; and then explain how nonmarket factors influence innovation.<br /><br />Then in Part II, \\"Illustrations of Theory-Based Analysis,\\" they apply various TBA tools when examining the future of education, aviation, semiconductors, healthcare, and telecommunications; using the same tools, they also assess strategies for both corporations and countries. Then in the \\"Conclusions\\" section, they step back and recap where they have taken their reader, suggest areas for further investigation, and provide some final thoughts. I especially appreciate the Appendix in which the authors provide a summary of the book's key concepts.<br /><br />All of the most important points made in this book help us to understand both the opportunities and (yes) the perils of disruptive innovation. They include: disruption is a process, NOT an event; disruption is a relative phenomenon in that what is disruptive to one company may be sustaining to another; different, even radical technology does NOT equal disruptive; disruptive innovations are NOT limited to high-tech markets. Re this last point, the authors carefully explain that disruption can occur in any product or service market and can even help to explain competition among national economies. (Please see Chapter Chapter 9, pages 207-223). Another substantial value-added benefit of this book is derived from the generously annotated \\"Notes\\" at the end of each chapter. Together, these sections (all by themselves) are worth far more the cost of this book.<br /><br />Thus, in a single volume, the authors guide and inform decision-makers in all manner of organizations as they embark on the three-part process by which to (1) identify signals of change, (2) evaluate competitive, head-to-head battles between companies loosely classified as \\"attackers\\" and \\"incumbents\\" (please see the Glossary), (3) formulate appropriate strategic choices that can influence the outcome of competitive battles, and (4) meanwhile establish and then sustain an effective relationship between innovation and nonmarket forces such as government regulation. Christensen, Anthony, and Roth are to be congratulated for what I consider to be a brilliant achievement. Reluctant as I am to predict anything, I feel certain that Seeing What's Next will become a business book \\"classic.\\"titive battles, and (4) meanwhile establish and then sustain an effective relationship between innovation and nonmarket forces such as government regulation.

Even books as thoughtful, practical, and eloquent as Tracy's are essentially worthless unless and until one is both willing and eager, indeed determined to gain and then sustain control of one's self. Also, it is impossible to \\"create more time\\": there are 60 seconds each minute, 60 minutes each hour, 24 hours each day. etc. No more and no less. But what is possible, obviously, is to reorganize consumption of finite time. For that, there are two essential elements: will-power and a system. In this volume, Tracy offers what is characterized as \\"a proven system for getting more done in less time than you ever thought possible.\\" Such a system must be both effective and efficient, two different attributes which are incorrectly used interchangeably. Tracy's core concept focuses on the ROI of time consumption. First, priorities must be set. Next, specific objectives to be achieved. Then a determination of what must be done to achieve them. Finally, a realistic estimate of how much time will be needed to do so. It is also helpful to know what the most common time-wasters are (other than lethargy) and most of the worst involve others. (\\"Gotta a minute?\\") Hence the importance of focus amidst distractions. Effective time-, life-, and self-management can indeed produce highly beneficial results. Tracy identifies four:<br /><br />1. Gain [at least] two hours each day.<br /><br />2. Improve your productivity and performance.<br /><br />3. Increase your sense of control.<br /><br />4. Have more time for your family.<br /><br />To \\"gain\\" time is to reduce the waste of time. I agree with Tracy that there are several barriers to overcome. They include anxiety about decreasing \\"naturalness\\" and \\"spontaneity,\\" negative mindsets, and self-limiting beliefs. In this context, I am reminded of what Henry Ford is alleged to have observed years ago: \\"Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.\\" In  response to such barriers, Tracy correctly recommends the use of positive self-talk, visualizing one's self as highly efficient, \\"acting\\" the desired \\"part,\\" benchmarking against the best by patterning one's self after someone who makes maximum use of available time, becoming a teacher (i.e. imagining that one \\"is going to teach as course in time management one year from today\\") and becoming a role model for others (e.g. spouse, children, business associates). To assist his reader, Tracy offers Three Self-Esteem Builders, Three Steps to Performance Improvement,  and Twelve Proven Principles for Peak Performance. At the end of each chapter, moreover, he provides an \\"Action Exercises\\" section which enables his reader apply effectively what she or he has learned in that chapter.<br /><br />What we have in this volume is indeed a cohesive, comprehensive, and (yes) time-effective system. How valuable this system proves to be will, of course, vary from one reader to the next. Tracy reminds his reader that \\"Time management is a lifestyle that must be practiced every hour, every day, all the days of your life. It is the one habit, the one discipline that is essential to everything else you want to achieve. With excellent time management skills and practices, there are no limits.\\" Again, I agree. To paraphrase Ford, whether you think you can or cannot benefit from the system which Tracy recommends, you're right.hether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.\\" In  response to such barriers, Tracy correctly recommends the use of positive self-talk, visualizing one's self as highly efficient, \\"acting\\" the desired \\"part,\\" benchmarking against the best by patterning one's self after someone who makes maximum use of available time, becoming a teacher (i.e. imagining that one \\"is going to teach as course in time management one year from today\\") and becoming a role model for others (e.g. spouse, children, business associates).

It is the one habit, the one discipline that is essential to everything else you want to achieve. With excellent time management skills and practices, there are no limits.\\" Again, I agree. To paraphrase Ford, whether you think you can or cannot benefit from the system which Tracy recommends, you're right.	2004-09-02

It was thus with special interest, indeed eagerness that I began to read Calder's book in which he carefully examines each of those European airlines which are obviously in great debt (both philosophically and operationally) to \\"Herb\\" and his unique airline. It is important to remember, however, that imitation may be the highest form of flattery but there is far more involved in approximating Southwest's success than many may assume. According to Kelleher, \\"You can get the same airplane. You can get the same ticket counters.  You can get the same computers. But the hardest thing for a competitor to match is your culture and the spirit of your people and their focus on customer service because that isn't something you can do overnight and it isn't something you can do without a great deal of attention every day in a thousand different ways. That is why I say that our employees are our competitive protection.\\"<br /><br />That is precisely why David Neeleman and his JetBlue associates continue to commit so much of their resources to identifying, interviewing, hiring, and then training new \\"crewmembers,\\" NOT \\"employees\\" nor even \\"associates.\\" Long before Neeleman went to work for Southwest, he recalls a conversation with Kelleher. According to Neeleman, Kelleher said \\"I don't care about my shareholders.\\" Neeleman was shocked. What did he mean? Was Kelleher really serious? \\"Because I just take care of my employees. I know if I take care of my employees, they'll take care of my customers, and my customers will take care of my shareholders.\\" Presumably Michael O'Leary (then deputy chief executive of Ryanair) has comparable memories of his own conversations with Kelleher, especially during his (O'Leary's) visit in Dallas (1991). As he explained to Calder during one of several interviews, \\"Once we saw what Southwest was doing we thought this could be the way forward. We're imitating Southwest: selling at the lowest possible price to the maximum number of people. We've been replicating that successful formula now for the last twelve years with tremendous success.\\" It is noteworthy that in 1991, Ryanair was (in O'Leary's own words) \\"hovering on the verge of bankruptcy. In Spring 1991 I thought it would be a miracle if we were still in business three months later.\\" In 2001, Ryanair was more valuable than the biggest airline in the world.<br /><br />In this volume Calder, explains how that extraordinary turnaround was accomplished. He also examines with equal rigor other airlines and their CEOs, revealing sometimes similar but often different strategies and tactics with which they compete against each other during what Calder characterizes as \\"the low-cost revolution in the skies\\" above the UK and continental Europe. All of these airlines (e.g. Ryanair, easyJet, Buzz, Go) have obviously been influenced by \\"the Southwest way.\\" That said, of greatest interest and value to me is how extensively Calder takes his reader \\"behind the scenes, where the decisions that change the way we travel are taken, and scores are settled.\\" The reader may conclude that \\"the no-frills runway is more like a school playground; but to traditional airlines, and even some train operators, the no-frills carriers represent a potentially deadly threat.\\" It will be interesting to see which of the no-frills airlines throughout Europe and Asia prosper, which struggle, and which fail. It will also be interesting to see how the traditional airlines respond to the on-going, always volatile, and inevitably unpredictable \\"revolution\\" now in progress. Perhaps Calder will share his thoughts about all this in another book which (obviously) cannot be written for several years.<br /><br />Those who enjoy this book as much as I did are urgedto check out Kevin Freiberg and Jackie Freiberg's Nuts!: Southwest Airlines' Crazy Recipe for Business and Personal Success, James Wynbrandt's Flying High: How JetBlue Founder and CEO David Neeleman Beats the Competition, Jody Hoffer Gittell's The Southwest Airlines Way: Using the Power of Relationships to Achieve High Performance, and Gordon Bethune's From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback.berg and Jackie Freiberg's Nuts!: Southwest Airlines' Crazy Recipe for Business and Personal Success, James Wynbrandt's Flying High: How JetBlue Founder and CEO David Neeleman Beats the Competition, Jody Hoffer Gittell's The Southwest Airlines Way: Using the Power of Relationships to Achieve High Performance, and Gordon Bethune's From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback.	2004-09-01

His greatest battles include Granicus, Issus, Gaugamela, and Hydapses. What we know about him is based almost entirely on the works which survive written by Arrian, Rufus Curtius, Siculus Diodorus, and Plutarch. For most readers today, these are but names of countries, locations, and authors which probably have little inherent appeal. Interest in Alexander, however, does and should remain keen.<br /><br />In this volume, Kurke carefully traces his life and career inorder to answer questions such as these:<br /><br />1. How was Alexander able to accomplish so much from his succession (at age 20) to the throne of Macedonia (following his father Philip's assassination) until his own death only thirteen years later?<br /><br />2. What \\"enduring leadership lessons\\" can be learned from Alexander's achievements, lessons which are relevant to our contemporary world?<br /><br />Kurke focuses on 34 episodes which he organizes within the first four chapters, then shares his own \\"Concluding Thoughts About Leadership\\" in Chapter 5 followed by \\"Concluding Thoughts About Alexander\\" in Chapter 6. I presume to suggest that readers begin with \\"A Brief Chronology of Alexander's Life\\" which is located in the Appendix. Presumably they (as did I) will frequently refer back to it while proceeding through the core narrative which consists of a four-stage Leadership Process: Reframing Problems, Building Alliances, Establishing Identity, and Directing Symbols. Kurke also includes his own insights at the conclusion of each of the four chapters (i.e. one per process stage).<br /><br />Frankly, it is difficult for me to grasp the nature and extent of Alexander's achievements. For example, under his leadership, his armies eventually conquered approximately 90% of the (then) known world...and he is reputed to have known the names of most (if not all) of his 10,000 soldiers. Another example: A student of Aristotle, Alexander was later trained as a doctor and personally attended to the wounds of his soldiers and refused medical treatment of his own (countless) wounds until after his men had been properly cared for. Still another example: Faced with the separate but related problems of (a) providing for his wounded and aged veteran warriors while (b) maintaining control of areas that had been conquered, he established approximately 70 cities and towns of strategic value, occupied by Macedonian veterans and local volunteers who, together, managed those cities and towns effectively.<br /><br />With regard to the aforementioned \\"enduring leadership lessons\\" which Kurke proposes and discusses, it would be a disservice to him as well as to those who read this brief commentary to provide a list now. They are best examined within the context which Kurke carefully creates for each. Also, it makes more sense to correlate them within the four-stage sequence of the Leadership Process. Obviously I think very highly of this book which, in my opinion, makes a substantial contribution to our understanding of what can be described (for lack of a better term) as classical leadership and management principles. They will, of course, have varying degrees of relevance to those who read this book now but all are worthy of careful consideration.<br /><br />Well-done, Lance Kurke!of the (then) known world...and he is reputed to have known the names of most (if not all) of his 10,000 soldiers.

What we have here is a collection of material from Investor's Business Daily's \\"Leaders & Success\\" section which focuses on 55 \\"top sports leaders & how they achieved greatness.\\" Being somewhat of a listmaniac myself, I am always curious to see who makes a given list and who doesn't. Here's the problem which I as well as all other list compilers really cannot solve: Whom to replace? In this volume, Ben Hogan and Byron Nelson are mentioned only briefly. Should one or both replace Nancy Lopez, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, or Babe Didrikson Zaharias? What about Sam Snead who isn't even mentioned, nor are several great athletes in other sports such as Wilt Chamberlain, Jack Dempsey, Lou Gehrig, and Pete Sampras? Re the list of 55, should Chamberlain  replace Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (yes), Dempsey replace Jersey Joe Walcott (yes), Gehrig replace Jim Thorpe (at least in the baseball section, yes), and Sampras replace Ivan Lendl (yes)? Oh well. All 55 are worthy. Perhaps the most important differentiator is leadership. Even then, I have some disagreements. To repeat, oh well. This is the IBD's list, not mine.<br /><br />All that said, I enjoyed reading this book. It is filled with relevant information and makes a strong case for certain qualities of character which usually enable those who possess them to succeed, whatever the field of competition may be. For example, \\"they work hard, they're driven to achieve, they're fiercely determined [Dempsey once said that champions get up when they can't] and they also have a singular approach that sets them apart from the competition.\\" String together a series of adjectives associated with the 55 and you also have a respectable list of what success in other areas requires: studious, focused, stubborn, resourceful, tenacious, passionate for competition, self-assured, mentally as well as physically fit, obsessed with winning (or not losing), fearless, and proud.<br /><br />The material is organized within six Parts:<br /><br />Insisting on the Best (e.g. Mays, Hamm, McEnroe, Ted Williams)<br /><br />Clearing the Toughest Hurdles (e.g. Heiden, Thorpe, Ronaldo, Owens)<br /><br />Putting the \\"Work\\" in \\"Work Ethic\\" (e.g. Lewis, West, Erving, Armstrong)<br /><br />Learning How to Be the Greatest (e.g. Navratilova, Shoemaker, Louis, Spitz)<br /><br />Without Risk, There Is No Success (e.g. Jackie Robinson, Phil Jackson, Muhammad Ali, Rickey)<br /><br />Fine-Tuning Focus Yields Excellence (e.g. Auerbach, Jordan, Paige, and Gretzky)<br /><br />The profiles which I enjoyed most were of those about whom I knew little (if anything) previously. For example, George Haines, Erik Weihenmayer, Jackie Stiles, Peggy Fleming, Paula Newby-Fraser, and Nadia Comaneci.

Smart of more than 4,000 executives in 50 of the \\"Fortune 500\\" companies, shared in Topgrading which I have reviewed previously. The results confirm Peter Drucker's assertion that \\"The ability to make good decisions regarding people represents one of the last reliable sources of competitive advantage, since very few organizations are very good at it.\\" For me, the most stunning revelations in Smart's book are found on page 50, in Figure 3.2, \\"Cost of Mis-Hire Study Results.\\" According to the results of Smart's extensive research study, the sum of total costs of a mis-hire (on average) are as follows:<br /><br />Base salary Less than $100,000: 14 times salary<br /><br />Base Salary $100,000-250,000: 28 times salary<br /><br />All Salaries: 24 times salary<br /><br />Sobering statistics indeed. In his book, Falcone includes two recurring sections which define the context within which each of the 96 questions is asked: \\"Why Ask This Question?\\" and \\"Analyzing the Response.\\" He also alerts the reader/interviewer to relevant \\"Red Flags\\" which might otherwise be invisible. Books such as this (and it's one of the best) can guide and inform a rigorous process by which to identify those candidates which offer the strongest talent, skills, and (yes) character. I strongly recommend this book to any and all decision-makers and decision-influencers who are involved in their organization's hiring process. But please keep in mind that candidates may have also read this book. For interviewers, it is highly desirable to reveal the person \\"behind the resume.\\" It is also imperative to obtain \\"real information\\" from credible reference persons.

She does indeed explain how and why both winning streaks and losing streaks begin and end but she also explores with her characteristic rigor and eloquence what she calls a basic truth: \\"People rise to the occasion when they have the confidence to do it.\\" Human success and failure have quite specific cycles which can be measured in terms of equally specific trajectories. However, when human nature is involved, geometric measurement (at best) indicates trends, patterns, etc. but fails to explain the single most important, indeed most decisive element: self-image. Henry Ford no doubt had that in mind when suggesting \\"Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.\\" Kanter would agree, of course, but WHY do so few people demonstrate a positive self-fulfilling prophecy whereas most demonstrate a negative self-fulfilling prophecy? These are among the questions which Kanter addresses in this book.<br /><br />Of special interest to me is her examination of examples provided by athletic teams when delineating her core concepts. (She also offers excellent examples from the business world which is to be expected, given her professional career and previous books and articles.) As Kanter suggests, there is much of great value to be learned about creating and sustaining confidence from Geno Auriemma (University of Connecticut), Dusty Baker (San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs), Anson Dorrance (University of North Carolina), Mike Krzyzewski (Duke University), and Bob Ladouceur (De La Salle High School). The same lessons are revealed in the lives and careers of my own coaching role models, notably Joe Paterno (Penn State), John Wooden (U.C.L.A.), and Morgan Wooten (DeMatha High School). There are specific reasons why some organizations (including athletic teams) with relatively \\"less going for them\\" (e.g. funds, facilities, and talent) continue to succeed in competition against others with greater advantages. Those who are \\"winners\\" have self-confidence, of course, but they also have a strong sense of team and appreciate the importance of everyone else involved with them as well as everyone else who helped to make their success possible. They realize that they, like Sir Isaac Newton, have been privileged to stand \\"on the shoulders of giants.\\" For that reason, Charles Lindbergh chose \\"We\\" as the title of his autobiography.<br /><br />Both winning streaks and losing streaks seem to be contagious. Kanter helps her reader to understand how they develop and, more importantly, what they reveal about their probable causes. In her final chapter she observes \\"In losing streaks, it seems as though talent has disappeared and decline is inevitable -- or else why would the workers, the managers, the politicians, the players let the situation continue to deteriorate? [i.e. the negative self-fulfilling prophecy] The opposite appears to be at work in winning streaks -- that individuals can perform miracles, that they do indeed walk on water. But every water walker needs the stones to make it possible to move across the water.\\"<br /><br />I consider this to be Kanter's most valuable book because it speaks to anyone and to everyone who struggles to \\"rise to the occasion\\" but now lacks the confidence to do it. The stones are already there beneath them. Kanter will help her reader to locate them, then \\"rise to victory\\"...not only in competition but in personal fulfillment.ntinue to succeed in competition against others with greater advantages.

Most of us learned early in  life that Robert Fulton invented the first steam-powered boat, just as we were also told in school that Thomas Edison invented almost everything else, including the light bulb. In fact, James Rumsey and John Fitch competed strenuously to be the first to launch a steam-powered boat. During the summer of 1790, Fitch launched a steamboat commuter service between Philadelphia and Trenton but was unable to make it profitable in competition with stagecoaches. It was not until almost 20 years later (1807) that Fulton's Clermont carried passengers between New York City and Albany.<br /><br />The need for water transportation was obvious, hence the importance of barges but they could not proceed against the current and had to be towed back or returned over land for their next voyage. What if the power of steam could be used to solve that problem? Of course, those whose economic self-interests would be threatened by (in effect) a steam-powered barge -- notably owners and employees of stagecoach and barge companies -- did all they could to oppose efforts by Rumsey and Fitch. They delayed but could not ultimately deny what proved to be the inevitable commercial success of steam-powered boats, \\"America's first great invention.\\"<br /><br />Sutcliffe's writing skills are such that her presentation of historical material reads like a novel worthy of Charles Dickens in his prime. Her narrative has everything:  passionate and determined antagonists, a plot filled with crisis and conflict, conspiracies, use and abuse of political influence as well as all manner of anecdotes which help to reveal the stresses, tensions, and (yes) opportunities which developed during the years immediately following the American Revolution.<br /><br />Great stuff!	2004-08-26

Even in the World's Most Turbulent Industry	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Attitude Is Altitude	This really isn't a biography of David Neeleman (pronounced \\"Neel-Mun\\"). Rather, Wyndbrant carefully integrates relevant information from both Neeleman's life and his career to explain JetBlue's success to date. Neeleman would be the first to point out that, in the airline industry (de-regulated since October 28, 1978), it is a fool's errand to predict which airlines today are totally secure and which are doomed. All airlines have problems which vary only in nature and degree. However, JetBlue is probably in better shape than most others are even as Neeleman explains that how it can become better while becoming larger \\"is the question that we're wrestling with at JetBlue, and I think it's something that we focus on a lot.\\" He adds, \\"I believe we are going to be able to...have a thriving, prosperous company, that we're setting the standard in what we're doing in customer service, and that we'll continue to grow in the future.\\"<br /><br />Of special interest to me is what Wyndbrant reveals about the major influences on Neeleman's life and career, notably his membership in the Church of Latter Day Saints, his career successes (e.g. leadership of WestJet and then Morris Air) as well as career failures (e.g. bankruptcy and liquidation of The Hawaii Express and being fired by Southwest Airlines), the impact of having A.D.D., and his efforts to plan, obtain financing for, and then launch JetBlue.<br /><br />With regard to JetBlue's business model, it clearly indicates what Neeleman learned during his associations with the three airlines (WestJet, Morris, and Southwest Airlines). According to Wyndbrant, as JetBlue was about to be launched at John F. Kennedy International Airport in February of 2000,<br /><br />\\"Neeleman promised New Yorkers -- and the world -- a new kind of economy travel aboard planes with wider, all-leather seats, extra leg room, preassigned seats, and more overhead storage space than other carriers delivered. Moreover, all of this would be provided at a price that was up to 65 percent less than the competition. Furthermore, there would be no requirement for staying at destinations over a Saturday night to qualify for the lowest fare, as the major carriers mandated. Even the price of walk-up tickets would be below standard fares many airlines charged for flights of a similar distance. On the ground, JetBlue would offer quick, computerized, touch-screen check-in. Perhaps most notable of all, in the air, passengers would be able to watch 24 channels of live TV displayed on individual monitors mounted in every seatback. JetBlue would be the first airline in the world to make this entertainment amenity available to all its passengers.\\"<br /><br />This is almost precisely the same business model which enabled JetBlue to attract its senior management team as well as to obtain about $130-million in initial financing. It also explains how JetBlue was able to differentiate itself from various competitors. With all due respect to JetBlue's business plan, leadership, and capital, however,  Neeleman insists that JetBlue's crewmembers (NOT \\"employees\\" nor even \\"associates\\") have established -- and will continue to sustain -- the airline's single most decisive competitive advantage. On this point, he and Southwest Airlines' Herb Kelleher are in total agreement as I shall explain in greater detail later. Wyndbrant devotes substantial attention in this book to how JetBlue recruits, interviews, and evaluates prospective crewmembers. He then explains how they are trained.<br /><br />There is so much of value in this book which is directly relevant to decision-makers in almost any other organization, regardless of size or nature. Obviously, Neeleman is an uncommonly intelligent, ambitious, talented, principled, and caring CEO. However, the success achieved by JetBlue thus far is the result of teamwork under his leadership. For me, the key point in this book is illustrated by what is certainly not unique to JetBlue: the process by which a visionary can attract and then galvanize so many different but compatible people with comparable skills, decency, and experience to help launch what became a crusade, in this instance (in Neeleman's words) \\"to bring humanity back to air travel.\\"<br /><br />Wyndbrant focuses on so many revealing, indeed defining moments in his book. I now conclude this brief commentary with one of them. Kelleher once told Neeleman, \\"I don't care about my shareholders.\\" Neeleman was shocked. What did he mean? Was Kelleher really serious? \\"Because I just take care of my employees. I know if I take care of my employees, they'll take care of my customers, and my customers will take care of my shareholders.\\"  Long before Neeleman went to work for Southwest Airlines, Kelleher once observed \\"You can get the same airplane. You can get the same ticket counters.  You can get the same computers. But the hardest thing for a competitor to match is your culture and the spirit of your people and their focus on customer service because that isn't something you can do overnight and it isn't something you can do without a great deal of attention every day in a thousand different ways. That is why I say that our employees are our competitive protection.\\"<br /><br />What lies ahead for these two uncommonly successful airlines? Since my crystal ball imploded more than 20 years ago, I stopped making predictions. Let's await further developments...and probably not have to wait long.lvanize so many different but compatible people with comparable skills, decency, and experience to help launch what became a crusade, in this instance (in Neeleman's words) \\"to bring humanity back to air travel.\\"     Wyndbrant focuses on so many revealing, indeed defining moments in his book.

Each volume is indeed \\"a highly practical resource for readers with all levels of experience.\\" And each is by intent and in execution solution-oriented. Although I think those who have only recently embarked on a business career will derive the greatest benefit, the material is well-worth a periodic review by senior-level executives.<br /><br />In this volume, Richard Luecke assembles cutting edge thinking about managing creativity and innovation, ably assisted subject adviser Ralph Katz, a professor at Northeastern University's College of Business and in the Management of Technology Group of M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management. They have carefully organized the material within these eight chapters:<br /><br />1. Types of Innovation (Several Types on Many Fronts)<br />2. The S-Curve (A Concept and Its Lessons)<br />3. Idea Generation (Opening the Genie's Bottle)<br />4. Recognizing Opportunities (Don't Let the Good Ones Slip By)<br />5. Moving Innovation to Market (Will It Fly?)<br />6. Creativity and Creative Groups (Two Keys to Innovation)<br />7. Enhancing Creativity (Enriching the Organization and Workplace)<br />8. What Leaders Must Do (Making a Difference)<br /><br />In the two appendices which follow, there are brief but insightful discussions of \\"The Time Value of Money\\" and \\"Useful Innovation Tools.\\" Luecke and Katz also provide sections dedicated to Notes, Glossary, and For Further Reading. If you need assistance with mastering essentials in only one of these areas, I urge you to purchase a copy of this book ASAP. Luecke is an uncommonly clear thinker and writer. Thoughtfully, he provides a \\"Summing Up\\" section at the end of each chapter to facilitate a review of key points.<br /><br />There are four other books which I also presume to recommend highly, all of which are available in a paperbound edition. First, Michael Michalko's Cracking Creativity in which he explains how to use various strategies to overcome (\\"crack\\") barriers to human creativity: knowing how to see, making a thought visible, thinking fluently, making novel (bizarre is better) combinations, connecting the unconnected, looking at \\"the other side,\\" looking in other \\"worlds,\\" finding what you are not looking for, and wakening the collaborative spirit. In Expect the Unexpected, Roger von Oech discusses 30 \\"Creative Insights\\" of Heraclitus which include, for example, #2. \\"Expect the unexpected or you won't find it,\\" #4 \\"You can't step into the same river twice,\\"#12 \\"Many fail to grasp what's right in the palm of their hand,\\" and #26 \\"Donkeys prefer garbage to gold.\\" Obviously, von Oech agrees with Jim Collins that the most formidable barriers to creative thinking include what Collins describes as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" If you need expert advice on how to plan and then conduct effective brainstorming sessions, the \\"must reads\\" include Doug Hall's Jump Start Your Brain and Tom Kelley's The Art of Innovation.<br /><br />As is also true of each of the others in the Harvard Business Essentials series, this volume is essentially a primer on cutting-edge thinking about an especially important business subject. Yes, much of the material is generic. No, it doesn't offer a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system for managing creativity and innovation. However, any one of the eight chapters (all by itself) is worth far more than the cost of this book. Obviously, I highly recommend it. In fact, I think every decision-maker should read all of the volumes in the Harvard Business Essentials series and then re-visit relevant portions in them (previously highlighted,of course) on an as-needed basis.	2004-08-26

This is one in a series of several dozen volumes which comprise the \\"Harvard Business Review Paperback Series.\\" Each offers direct, convenient, and inexpensive access to the best thinking on the given subject in articles originally published by the Harvard Business Review. I strongly recommend all of the volumes in the series. The individual titles are listed at this Web site: [...] The authors of various articles are among the world's most highly regarded experts on the given subject. All of the volumes have been carefully edited. An Executive Summary introduces each selection. Supplementary commentaries are also provided in most of the volumes, as is an \\"About the Contributors\\" section which usually includes suggestions of other sources which some readers may wish to explore.<br /><br />Truer now than ever before, \\"you can't manage what you can't measure.\\" However, four questions must first be answered:<br /><br />1. What do I need to know?<br /><br />2. Why do I need to know it?<br /><br />3. How can I verify what I think I have learned?<br /><br />4. How will I then use what I have learned?<br /><br />What we have in this volume are eight articles, several of which later developed into best-selling business books. For example,  Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton co-authored three of articles in this volume in which they introduce the concept of the balanced scorecard, suggest \\"measures that drive performance, explain how to put the balanced scoreboard to work, and then how to use it as a strategic management system. They then co-authored several books in which they developed these and other core concepts in much greater depth. My personal favorite is The Strategy-Focused Organization.<br /><br />The lead article by Peter F. Drucker (\\"The Information Executives Truly Need to Know\\") was originally published in the Harvard Business Review (January-February 1995, Reprint 95104). True, many of Drucker's ideas have since been recycled in several of his books but so what? I found so much in this article to highlight with my trusty optic yellow Accent pen that I eventually needed two of them. Drucker focuses on the tools executives require to generate the information they need....and the concepts underlying those tools. \\"The new tools enable us -- indeed may force us -- to see our businesses differently\\" as \\"generators of resources, as links in an economic chain, as society's organs for the creation of wealth, and as both creatures and creators of a material environment.\\" Great stuff.<br /><br />The titles of the other articles give you some idea of what their authors have to say about measuring corporate performance: Robert G. Eccles' \\"The Corporate Manifesto,\\" Joseph A. Ness and Thomas G. Cucuzza's \\"Tapping the Full Potential of ABC\\" (i.e. activity-based management), Robert Simons and Antonio D&aacute;vila's \\"How High Is Your Return on Management?,\\" and Christopher Myers' \\"How the Right Measures Help Teams Excel.\\" The volume concludes with the three Kaplan-Norton articles.<br /><br />As is each of the others in the HBR series, this volume is essentially a primer on cutting-edge thinking about an especially important business subject. Yes, much of the material is generic. No, it doesn't offer a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system for corporate performance measurement.

For example, exporting American culture to foreign countries through films, music, clothing, and fast food restaurants. Or it could suggest a process by which America extends its political and economic influence internationally.  For Lou Dobbs, it refers to \\"corporate greed [which] is shipping American jobs overseas.\\" He insists that \\"outsourcing and the motives behind it are simply destructive of our way of life. And [that] has to end.\\" In the first eight chapters of his book, Dobbs surveys the nature and extent of a situation which obviously disturbs him greatly. In Chapter Nine (\\"A Simple Choice\\"), he suggests a choice which is clear but hardly simple: \\"...whether we will demand reciprocal benefits, mutuality, and balance in our trading relationships or will simply continue policies and practices that strip us of our wealth and destroy our way of life.\\" Then in the final chapter, he recommends a number of solutions which (in his opinion and others') will begin to solve social and economic problems which have been developing in the United States for at least 20-25 years. \\"Reversing decades of free-trade-at-any-cost policies, destructive free trade agreements, and chronic trade deficits will require first an honest public debate and then tough political choices. But our mistakes are reversible. We still have our destiny in our hands.\\"<br /><br />Frankly, I am still struggling to formulate my own opinions. For purposes of discussion now, let's say that a hypothetical U.S. company, LouDob Corporation (LDC), designs, manufactures, sells, and distributes children's apparel in what continues to be a ferociously competitive marketplace. Increasing costs of materials and labor create razor-thin margins. Then an opportunity arises to add a major retail chain as a customer, Mart-Wal International. The sale will immediately double LDC's sales. Through prior due diligence, LDC learned that it can achieve almost unlimited production capacity in an Asian country and do so for a fraction of what production would cost in the U.S. To make the sale to Mart-Wal profitable, outsourcing makes compelling financial sense. However, at least 35% of LDC's employees in the U.S. would lose their jobs. What to do?<br /><br />I think Dobbs has made a substantial contribution to what should indeed be \\"an honest public debate\\" about the issues he addresses in this book and during his CNN telecasts. These issues take on even greater importance when we consider the current inconsistencies within international codes of law concerning intellectual property.due diligence, LDC learned that it can achieve almost unlimited production capacity in an Asian country and do so for a fraction of what production would cost in the U.S. To make the sale to Mart-Wal profitable, outsourcing makes compelling financial sense.

(I can think of at least a dozen films in which he delivers a brilliant performance. For example, From Here to Eternity, The Man with the Golden Arm, The Manchurian Candidate, and The Detective.) The quality of his art as a performer is not in dispute. Rather, it is Sinatra's personal life which continues to generate so many differences of opinion. I was attracted to Munn's book because it claims to provide \\"the untold story\\" of Sinatra's relationships with the Mafia, John and Robert Kennedy, Ava Gardner, and Marilyn Monroe. Although much of that story had been told prior to the first publication of this book in 2001, Munn explains that he \\"resorted to researching as few books as possible\\" because he never intended to write a full-scale biography. In fact, what he offers consists almost entirely of what he claims to have obtained during dozens of interviews, notably of Gardner.<br /><br />Other reviewers have duly noted the book's easily-avoidable inaccuracies (e.g. the Henry James band) and sloppy editing (e.g. countless redundancies). My rating is more the result of problems I have with Munn's credibility. He was not an eyewitness to most of the Sinatra behavior which serves as the book's focus. Moreover, he asks his reader to trust him completely when sharing what eyewitnesses (again, notably Ava Gardner) allegedly told him. Did they know what they were talking about? Are their accusations verifiable? Is Munn their messenger or their interpreter? If the latter, how reliable is he? I am also curious to know why Ava: My Story (1990) is not listed among his \\"Selected Bibliography and Sources.\\" According to Munn, Gardner was the single most important source for the material in his book.<br /><br />Think about various components in Sinatra's life: the Mafia, the Oval Office, the F.B.I. and C.I.A., Hollywood, the Bogart Rat Pack and then the Sinatra Rat Pack, Las Vegas, Ava Gardner, Marilyn Monroe, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Mia Farrow, Fidel Castro, Richard Nixon...conspiracies, assassinations, vast wealth (mansions, private jets, etc.), countless awards, non-publicized philanthropies...just about everything needed to write a full-scale biography of one of the most interesting and (yes) enigmatic celebrities in our contemporary culture. It is possible but unlikely that the author of that biography will find much of unique value in Munn's book.

An abundance of research leaves absolutely no doubt whatsoever that for an organizations to be both profitable and durable, they must constantly reinvent themselves. Obviously, the nature and extent of that process will be determined by various factors such as timing, available resources, competitive marketplace, etc. Meanwhile, like the Southwest Airlines flight schedule between Dallas and Houston, there seems to be a new paradigm every 20-30 minutes. Moreover, organizations are at various stages of transition from one paradigm to another. And meanwhile, change remains the only constant.<br /><br />In this volume, Slater explains how Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer reinvented their company. Microsoft? Yes, even one of the world's most profitable and valuable companies reached a point at which significant transformation was necessary. Slater organizes his material within five Parts: The Four-Year Crisis, Emerging from the Crisis, How Bill Gates Reinvented Microsoft, How Steve Ballmer Reinvented Microsoft, and The Rebooting of Microsoft.<br /><br />Slater responds to questions such as these:<br /><br />1. What was the nature and extent of what he calls \\"the four-year crisis\\"?<br /><br />2. Why did it last for as long as it did?<br /><br />3. What did Gates and Ballmer learn from it?<br /><br />4. To what extent (if any) did they disagree on what to do in response to it?<br /><br />5. If there were differences between them, how were they resolved?<br /><br />6. In Leading Change, Jim O'Toole has much of value to say about resistance to change. He claims that much of it is the result of what he calls \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" To what extent was there such resistance within the Microsoft organization?<br /><br />7. What was done to overcome it? Were those efforts successful?<br /><br />8. According to Slater, what lessons can be learned from the entire process which included but was not limited to Microsoft's rebooting?<br /><br />9. Given his direct and extensive access to Gates and Ballmer (interviewing them separately as well as together), what does he think of each?<br /><br />10. In Slater's opinion, what must be done to complete the reforms at Microsoft now underway?<br /><br />Slater is the author of more than 25 books, most of which I have read and reviewed. In my opinion, this is his most important work thus far, in part because of what it reveals about Gates, Ballmer, and their company but also because it reminds all of us that even a Microsoft will always be a \\"work in progress\\"...and that only hard and smart \\"work\\" will achieve the \\"progress\\" on which success depends.as together), what does he think of each?    10.

(His reddish-amber curls, strong as the curls on the brow of a young bull, his proud, but not despising, bearing, emphasized this.) Mr. Augustus John's portrait of him is beautiful but gives him a cherubic aspect, which though pleasing, does not convey ... Dylan's look of archangelic power. In full face he looked much as William Blake must have looked as a young man. He had full eyes--like those of Blake--giving him at first the impression of being unseeing, but seeing all, looking over immeasurable distances.\\" Of course, she does not describe what was in his mind and heart. For that, we rely on what was revealed by his behavior during an avoidably brief life (1914-1953) and by what is suggested in what he wrote. Also, we have two excellent biographies. This one and another written by Paul Ferris.<br /><br />Briefly, here is some background information about Thomas' life. He was born in the Welsh seaport of Swansea, Carmarthenshire, and received all of his formal education at the local grammar school. He then earned his living in a variety of jobs as an actor, reporter, reviewer, and handyman. At age 22, he married Caitlin Macnamara and thus began an especially tumultuous relationship which continued until his death. She bore him three children. For most of his adult life, he struggled to support his family (e.g. writing for the Ministry of Education) before serving in World War Two as an anti-aircraft gunner. Afterward, his struggles to support himself and family continued, even with writing assignments for the BBC. Then in 1950, he delivered the first of a series of readings of his works in the United States, returning twice more for additional tours in 1952 and 1953. Caitlin soon grew to hate the United States because (in her opinion) the adoration he received there activated, indeed encouraged his excessive appetites, especially for alcohol and for other women. One of my college English professors had accompanied Thomas during several of his binges in New York City in 1953. I asked him what Thomas had died of. He replied \\"Everything.\\" His life ended prematurely but probably inevitably in San Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan on November 9, 1953. He was 39 years of age.<br /><br />Credit Lycett with rigorous and comprehensive research on Thomas' life. He also had one significant resource which Ferris did not: Ferris. (Also Welch, Ferris was born about a mile from Thomas' childhood home.) There are passages in this book when it seems that Lycett is as charmed by Thomas as were so many others, giving the brilliant poet the benefit of the doubt when discussing his frequently offensive behavior, especially his mean-spirited abuse of family members (notably wife Caitlin) as well as of others who befriended him. (Ferris is far less forgiving of Thomas' misbehavior.) According to Thomas, his work provides \\"the record of my individual struggle from darkness toward some measure of light.....To be stripped of darkness is to be clean, to strip of darkness is to make clean.\\" As both Lycett and Ferris clearly indicate, there were many times in Thomas' life when he disappeared into the \\"darkness\\" of his self-indulgences, cleansing only temporarilty whatever self-loathing may have driven him there.<br /><br />Commissioned by the BBC for its Third Programme, Under Milk Wood was Thomas' last published work. It is much more a pageant or review rather than a classically structured drama, one in which Thomas celebrates his heritage in much the same spirit Edgar Lee Masters celebrates his in Spoon River Anthology. It is also worth noting that when he died, Thomas had been at work on several promising radio projects (e.g. The Town That Was Mad and Quid's Inn) which could have led to greater fame and fortune. Those who have heard recordings during which hereads from his works are already aware of his talents as a performer. (By the way, I have often wondered what Garrison Keeler's influences were when he first envisioned Lake Wobegon as the centerpiece of his Prairie Home Companion. Did they include Masters and Thomas?) His premature death denied him these promising opportunities and all others the pleasure of new works of poetic art he may well have produced, had he lived longer.<br /><br />I rate this book so highly because of its wealth of carefully developed biographical material. However, as indicated earlier, it is important to keep in mind that Lycett allows Thomas far more latitude than does Ferris when commenting on Thomas' personal behavior. Many of those who knew him well despised him but countless others, few of whom knew him well, adored him. Their adoration apparently justified in his mind the excesses which eventually caused his death. In terms of literary criticism, I think Ferris has much more of value to say but I am grateful to both for helping me to gain a better understanding of the man whose reading of A Child's Christmas in Wales is among our family's greatest joys each holiday season.are already aware of his talents as a performer.

What we have here in this volume are several of his best, all but one of which previously appeared in that magazine. Specific subjects include the Howell Raines \\"doctrine\\" during his tenure at the New York Times, Mark H. Willes' major reorganization of that newspaper, initiatives within the Tribune Company to achieve organizational synergies, the \\"tabloid wars\\" waged by the New York Daily News and the New York Post, Arthur M. Sulzberger, Jr.'s \\"Outward Bound Adventure\\" at the New York Times, a profile of John McCandlish Phillips, Jr. (\\"the reporter who disappeared\\"), an explanation of how and why \\"fee speech\\" could corrupt \\"journalism's claim to public trust,\\" a profile of Don Imus, an examination of the life and death of Inside.com, and an analysis of the creation, emergence, and impact of Fox News.<br /><br />However, Auletta's primary objective is to answer questions such as these:<br /><br />1. What is the proper role of the news media?<br />2. How has that role changed during the last decade? Why?<br />3. What are the nature and extent of the impact of business considerations on the selection, articulation, and provision of news?<br /><br />Auletta's thinking and writing have exceptional rigor, focus, and clarity. Yes, we learn a great deal about the individuals and organizations on which he focuses in this volume but its much greater value (to me) is derived from his thoughtful and eloquent responses to the questions posed earlier.	2004-08-17

What we have here is a chronological sequence of analyses from Richard Brookhiser's of George Washington until Paul A. Gigot's of George Walker Bush. There is a separate chapter devoted to each of the 43 presidents, all of them written by an expert on the given president. I especially appreciate the reader-friendly checklist of key facts which precedes each of the commentaries. Contributors include Lynne Cheney (on James Madison) and John S. McCain (on Theodore Roosevelt) and both have much of substantial value to say about their subjects, as do all of the others.<br /><br />Presidents are classified within six categories: Great, Near Great, Above Average, Average, Below Average, and Failure.  Some rankings surprised me as being too high (e.g. Dwight Eisenhower as Near Great and John Kennedy as Above Average) or too low (e.g. Richard Nixon as Below Average) but  such reactions are no doubt indicative of my lack of expertise. In any event, I was grateful to learn the reasons for various rankings.<br /><br />Other sections of special interest include William J. Bennett's Foreword, Steven G. Calabresi's Introduction, and four brilliant essays on various \\"Issues in Presidential Leadership\\" (i.e. economic policy, during wartime, the judiciary, and after disputed elections).

Obviously, only someone who has a special interest in him would be checking out reviews of this book. Equally obvious to me, only someone encouraged by those reviews would then read a book of 1,280 pages (including its Index), especially given the fact that so many other excellent books about FDR have already been published. That said, I agree with Alan Brinkley who in his own review suggested that \\"this enormous book is also one of the best one-volume biographies of Roosevelt yet.\\" Black organizes his material within five Parts whose titles suggest the nature and scope of coverage:<br /><br />The Presidential Squire, 1882-1932<br /><br />The Great Depression and the New Deal, 1932-1938<br /><br />Toward the Rendezvous with Destiny -- Undeclared War, 1938-1941<br /><br />Day of Infamy and Years of Courage, 1941-1944<br /><br />Pax Americana, 1944-<br /><br />Although Black breaks no new ground and offers no head-snapping revelations, he does do quite well in delineating and then exploring FDR's multi-dimensional personality. So many paradoxes. Although born into wealth and social status and then educated at Groton and Harvard, FDR became a champion of those economically devastated by the Great Depression (e.g. 30% employment) when elected the 32nd president, initiating dozens of new programs (the New Deal) which created jobs, increased income for impoverished farmers, devalued the currency, enabled debtors to discharge debts, and reopened banks. Black cites dozens of examples which illustrate that, although possessed of almost irresistible charm, President Roosevelt seems to have used, abused, betrayed, ignored, or abandoned people whenever it served his purposes. However, there were millions of people throughout the world who understood and agreed with Winston Churchill's assertion that FDR was \\"the greatest man I have ever known.\\" Black's portrayal of FDR is generally balanced even as he expresses his own admiration of a president who led his nation through a great depression and then through most of a world war. It's all here, awaiting the next eager and persistent reader.<br /><br />Yes, this is indeed an \\"enormous book\\" but one which I thoroughly enjoyed reading. To those who prefer a more brief biography, I recommend Roy Jenkins' Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I also greatly admire Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox 1882-1940 and Roosevelt: Soldier of Freedom 1949-45 by James MacGregor Burns as well as Kathleen Judlinski's Franklin Delano Roosevelt, George McJimsey's The Presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Jon Meacham's Franklin and Winston.'s portrayal of FDR is generally balanced even as he expresses his own admiration of a president who led his nation through a great depression and then through most of a world war.

Bush and the events which led up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Woodward's personal style must be disarming because he was also to obtain unusually frank opinions from those primarily involved in the decision-making process prior to the invasion. That decision was by no means based on unanimous agreement. According to Woodward, Vice-President Richard Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld were among the invasion's strongest advocates whereas Secretary of State Colin Powell and General Tommy Franks expressed serious doubts or at least concerns. The ultimate decision to proceed with the invasion was, of course, made by President Bush who seems to have been strongly influenced by Saudi Ambassador Prince Bandar and CIA director George Tenet who insisted that the evidence that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction (WMD) was \\"a slam dunk.\\" Only later did Tenet concede that his intelligence was incorrect, corroborating Hans Blix's conclusions. In his book Disarming Iraq, Blix (a former director of the United Nations Inspection Commission) provides an eyewitness account of the search for weapons of mass destruction and of the events leading up to America's invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq.<br /><br />For me, the most interesting material in this book focuses on Colin Powell. Although previously involved in Operation Desert Storm (1991) as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Bush 41 administration, Powell had serious doubts (later substantiated) about the quality and reliability of CIA-provided intelligence concerning weapons of mass destruction. Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Tenet prevailed. The invasion was launched. As of when these comments of mine are formulated, there has been no evidence whatsoever that Iraq had or would soon have WMD. Meanwhile, the numbers of dead and wounded during occupation continue to increase.<br /><br />In this volume, Woodward provides direct and extended access to material which enables his reader to gain a better understanding of the events which preceded the invasion of Iraq, and, of the decision-making context within which the consequences of that \\"plan of attack\\" continue to reveal themselves.nt Chiefs of Staff during the Bush 41 administration, Powell had serious doubts (later substantiated) about the quality and reliability of CIA-provided intelligence concerning weapons of mass destruction.

In this book, he  provides a rigorous and eloquent discussion of \\"thirteen creative geniuses who changed the world.\\" Twelve of the thirteen could serve as positive role models for all youth regardless of their \\"color.\\" During the seven years since this book was first published, Michael Jackson's personal behavior in recent years has (in my opinion) disqualified himself from their distinguished company but no one can deny his \\"creative genius\\" nor the nature and extent of his success as an entertainer. Regrettably, he seems to have \\"killed\\" his career. Others may challenge the inclusion of Paul Robeson but I do not. They are urged to read Chapter 17 in which Landrum brilliantly discusses Robeson's life and career. He was a Phi Beta Kappa scholar and All American football player at Rutgers University (later inducted into the NCAA Football Hall of Fame), attorney, internationally renowned actor and singer, and a social (not political) activist whose initiatives and eloquence helped to achieve human rights for Afro-Americans, notably the Supreme Court decision in 1954 which declared school segregation unconstitutional. He overcame so many adversities himself while leveraging his celebrity to make it so much easier for others to overcome theirs.<br /><br />The most famous subjects in this book are Bill Cosby, Jackson, Michael Jordan, Colin Powell, and Oprah Winfrey but I was most interested in what Landrum reveals about John Johnson, Reginald Lewis, and Thurgood Marshall who continue to be neglected and underappreciated in terms of their importance, not only to the United States but to other countries throughout the world and for reasons which Landrum notes in the separate chapters devoted to them.<br /><br />A sufficient number of copies of this book should be readily available in every school and public library.

I was especially interested in this book because of the diversity of the 14 subjects examined: Napoleon Bonaparte, Walt Disney, Isadora Duncan, Amelia Earhart, Adolph Hitler, Howard Hughes, Maria Montessori, Rupert Murdoch, Edith Piaf, Pablo Picasso, Helena Rubenstein, Marquis de Sade, Nikola Tesla (more about him in a moment), and Frank Lloyd Wright. Let's pretend. What if you were asked to compile a list of those to be invited to a private dinner and you came up with these 14. Let's assume that there would be no language barriers and each was in her or his prime. What a lively evening that would be! Hopefully all of the guests would survive it.<br /><br />With regard to Tesla (1856-1943), frankly I knew nothing about him until reading this book. According to Landrum, Tesla was \\"arguably the greatest inventive genius who ever lived. Some called him mad, others a genius, but everyone agreed that he was an enigmatic superman.\\" His achievements include AC induction motors, first wireless (radio) transmission, fluorescent lights, solar engine, Tesla coil, VTOL, and concepts which led to the electron microscope, cosmic rays, guided missiles, and radar. He also predicted (in 1915) the inevitability of television and space satellites, with one of countless benefits being television reception via satellite. Given Tesla's obsessive-compulsive and megalomaniac behavior, he was presumably not always a pleasant fellow to be associated with but none can deny his importance in so many fields of scientific inquiry.<br /><br />This is a thoroughly entertaining as well as an immensely informative book. Landrum devotes a separate chapter to each of \\"the fourteen geniuses who broke the rules.\\" I especially appreciate his inclusion of 25 \\"Figures\\" which range from \\"Manic Achievers and Power Brokers\\" to \\"Twelve Principles of Instilling Creativity in Children.\\" Great stuff.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Landrum's Profiles of Genius, Profiles of Female Genius, and Entrepreneurial Genius as well as Howard Gardner's Leading Minds: An Anatomy Of Leadership and Creating Minds: An Anatomy of Creativity Seen Through the Lives of Freud, Einstein, Picasso, Stravinsky, Eliot, Graham, and Gandhi.rs and Power Brokers\\" to \\"Twelve Principles of Instilling Creativity in Children.\\" Great stuff.

In Against All Enemies, he examines the policies and initiatives of each in response to that global threat. He is especially critical of the current administration, charging that President Bush and his key advisors (notably Vice President Cheney, Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz) essentially ignored Al-Quaeda prior to September 11th (2001) and then underestimated it afterward, choosing instead to concentrate on eliminating the Saddam Hussein regime and thereby, in process, eliminate also the threat of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. On this last point, I strongly recommend Hans Blix's Disarming Iraq. A former director of the United Nations Inspection Commission, he gives an eyewitness account of  the search for weapons of mass destruction and of the events leading up to America's invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq.<br /><br />Several recently published books (including Clarke's and Blix's) focus on many of the same situations. For example:<br /><br />1. No matter who was in the Oval Office, the U.S.A. was ill-prepared to respond to (much less prevent) numerous acts of terrorism such as the killing of 278 Marines in Lebanon, the Libyan murder of 259 passengers on Pan Am 103, the attack on the U.S.S. Cole, and various events which occurred on September 11, 2001.<br /><br />2. At least during the last 12-15 years, the U.S.A.'s intelligence agencies have been unwilling and/or unable to exchange information and coordinate resources effectively between and among themselves, much less with intelligence agencies in other countries (e.g. France, Germany, Israel, and Italy).<br /><br />3. Despite all of its initiatives and their immense costs thus far, the U.S.A. remains vulnerable to acts of terrorism both domestically and internationally.<br /><br />In Against All Enemies, Clarke offers his own analysis of situations such as these, explains their causes and effects from his perspective, then proposes what he is convinced should be done in response to them. His credentials are impressive. However, frankly, I remain confused. For that reason, I continue to learn as much as I can inorder to reach my own conclusions about matters such as these:<br /><br />1. Why have members of the current administration attacked Clarke personally (ad hominem) rather than repudiate his accusations with seamless logic and indisputable evidence?<br /><br />2. Would the U.S.A. have been able to create a wide, deeper, and more effective coalition of allies had the primary focus been on Al-Kaeda rather than on Iraq? If so, why was that not the primary focus? If not, why not?<br /><br />3. Why was the U.S.A. so well-prepared to launch a successful invasion of Iraq but so poorly-prepared for consequent occupation? Meanwhile, the numbers of dead and wounded continue to increase each day.<br /><br />4. Now what? Precisely what do both President Bush and John Kerry say in response to that question?<br /><br />Richard Clarke provides his reader with a great deal of information and (yes) some very strong opinions about that information.

I found Sedgwick's book so interesting because it offers answers to questions such as these:<br /><br />1. How does Sedgwick define \\"modern\\"?<br /><br />2. Why was Gu&eacute;non so opposed to it?<br /><br />3. Why has Traditionalism attracted such a wide, deep, and diverse following  worldwide?<br /><br />4. What is the relationship between Traditionalism and Orientalism?<br /><br />5. What are the most relevant historical \\"streams and counterstreams\\"? Why?<br /><br />6. What have been the nature and extent of cultural displacement?<br /><br />7. What role has the tactic of (in italics) entrisme (end italics) played during the  development of Traditionalism?<br /><br />8. What is Frithjof Schuon's significance?<br /><br />9. Why have various religious leaders rejected Traditionalism?<br /><br />10. What are Traditionalism's sub-denominations and how do they differ from each other?<br /><br />During the Religioscope interview (5 June 2004), Sedgwick explains that \\"the real reason that I became interested in Traditionalism as a subject for research was growing astonishment at the extent and importance of the movement. I remember spending an evening, shortly after the Internet had reached Egypt, looking through the various editions and translations of Gu&eacute;non's works in European library catalogs-I couldn't believe it. And the more I looked, the more I found, and the more convinced I became that here was a story worth the telling.\\" According to Sedgwick, advocates of Gu&eacute;nonian Traditionalism share a conviction that \\"the modern world is not the result of progress out of darkness but of descent into darkness, that this - the time we live in - is a last age, a pretty low point of a last age at that. What has been lost - and what needs to be recovered, reinstated even - is `tradition.' And tradition can be fairly precisely defined, as the truths that should have been handed down from time immemorial, approximately the perennial philosophy, the original [in italics] Ur-religion [end italics] of humanity.\\"<br /><br />Sedgwick goes on to suggest that \\"Traditionalists are those who want to recover what has been lost, and who also recognize the `true' nature of modernity. And recognize that one of the most important aspects of modernity is inversion - that the world sees the valuable as worthless and the worthless as valuable, the good as bad and bad as good. Gu&eacute;non never saw a punk, but it would have made a lot of sense to him. And with that comes `counter-initiation' - religious movements that are actually irreligious, that actually lead away from what religion is meant to lead to. Again, Gu&eacute;non would have nodded knowingly at certain recent developments in the Catholic Church. Against counter-initiation, the only thing left is real, genuine initiation - into traditional esoterism.\\"<br /><br />I have included these brief excerpts from the Religioscope interview because I think they help to indicate what Sedgwick's objectives were when he set out to examine Gu&eacute;nonian Traditionalism. In my opinion, he achieves all of them but it remains for others far better qualified than I am to comment on the validity of his assumptions and conclusions re the questions listed earlier. I do wish to reiterate that I am grateful for what I have learned about \\"Traditionalism and the secret intellectual history of the twentieth century.\\"an be fairly precisely defined, as the truths that should have been handed down from time immemorial, approximately the perennial philosophy, the original [in italics] Ur-religion [end italics] of humanity.\\" <br /> <br />Sedgwick goes on to suggest that \\"Traditionalists are those who want to recover what has been lost, and who also recognize the `true' nature of modernity.

Weiss has updated his material to accommodate new laws, regulations, and court decisions which are directly relevant to discrimination and EEOC guidelines, employee verification and security, technology issues, sexual harassment, negligent hiring practices, management of people with disabilities, affirmative action, discipline and termination policies and procedures, defamation, violations of privacy, the Family and Medical Leave Act, evaluations and promotions, sex and age discrimination, and labor law.<br /><br /> As is also true of previous editions, the subtitle correctly indicates that Weiss explains &quot;safe hiring, managing & firing practices to keep you & your company out of court.&quot; He organizes the material as follows:<br /><br /> Part I Safe Hiring Practices [re recruiting, interviewing, and employment decisions]<br /><br /> Part II Safe Management Practices [re evaluations and promotions, preventing sex discrimination and sexual harassment on the job, employee action laws and labor rights]<br /><br /> Part III Safe Firing Practices [re discipline and firing practices, public policy, management of older employees]<br /><br /> With Weiss's guidance, it is possible for the decision-makers in any company to complete what amounts to a comprehensive &quot;audit&quot; of any and all areas in which that company could be vulnerable to litigation. Of at least equal importance, the same &quot;audit&quot; will help the company to determine precisely what its obligations are as an employer as well as what the legal rights of each employees are.<br /><br /> Perhaps it would be helpful to those who read this commentary if I now provide a brief excerpt which is representative of the quality of Weiss?s counsel throughout the entire book. I have deliberately selected an especially troublesome area, one which has been the focal point of countless lawsuits: Employee Performance Evaluation. According to Weiss: ?Subjective rating systems in themselves are not illegal. The EEOC and the courts recognize subjective job standards such as communication and leadership skills) and that the words [in italics] good, satisfactory, poor, and unsatisfactory [end italics] carry within them subjective elements. So where do they draw the line?<br /><br /> 1. When standards are unequally applied or do not exist at all; and<br /><br /> 2. When someone shows that the standards or their absence produces disparate treatment in promotion and compensation policies, as for example:<br /><br /> ? When sex stereotyping tainted the process by which a woman was denied a partnership in a [major] accounting firm or<br /><br /> ? When subjective decision making torpedoed promotion policies that have disparate impact on minorities.<br /><br /> EEOC and court rulings encourage objective performance appraisals, but they discourage using them as a subterfuge for discrimination.?<br /><br /> Weiss devotes all of Chapter 6 to explaining HOW to formulate policies and procedures so that all evaluations and promotions are ?safe.? That is, they are in full compliance with all applicable regulatory laws, rules, and regulations.<br /><br /> Throughout this brilliant book, as Weiss rigorously and thoroughly examines hiring, managing, and firing practices which are both ethical and legal, he explains What You Can Do and What You Cannot Do. However, with all due respect to Weiss, qualified legal counsel should be consulted to ensure that all of a company's policies and procedures are &quot;fair, square & legal.&quot; One of the many value-added benefits of this updated edition is that Weiss identifies a number of ?Cases? at the end of each chapter to which his readers and their legal counsel are referred. There are 17 cited at the end of Chapter 6.<br /><br /> An organization?s policies and procedures concerning employment law must then be carefully explained to all of its employees as well as contained within an employee manual. If at all possible, the same policies and procedures should be readily available online. Of course, they must be rigorously and consistently enforced. Even so, there may yet be frivolous lawsuits but at least the company has done everything possible to prevent them and is thus much better prepared to obtain a favorable decision in a court of law if and when involved in litigation.ocedures should be readily available online.

This is precisely what Jim O'Toole has in mind when discussing \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom\\" in his brilliant book Leading Change. As Gardner advocates, \\"One can -- and must -- go through an exercise of deep and pervasive mental surgery with respect to every entrenched view: Define it, understand the reasons for its provenance, point out its weaknesses, and then develop multiple ways of undermining that view and bolstering a more constructive one. In other words, [in italics] search for the resonance and [also in italics] stamp out the resistance.\\" It seems to me imperative that we never underestimate the nature and extent of resistance which results from \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom\\"<br />Gardner identifies seven factors (\\"sometimes I'll call them levers\\"), most or all of which may influence a mind change: research (relevant data), resonance (the affective component), redescriptions (mutually reinforcing images of what will result from the change), resources and rewards (perceived cost-benefit relationship), real world events (wars, hurricanes, terrorist attacks, depressions, etc.), and resistances (motivation stimulated by opposition). When we attempt to change our own minds or others' minds, or when they attempt to change theirs or ours, the process of persuasion usually involves concepts, stories, theories, and skills. How we (or others) use logic and/or evidence, for example, is determined by our (or their) age, intelligence, education and training, and experience. Young children who fully understand various fables and fairy tales will probably not understand concepts of gravity, democracy, photosynthesis, and pride. How parents attempt to convince their children to take proper care of their toys is obviously quite different from how the same parents attempt to persuade each other when disagreeing about financial issues. Gardner asserts (and I agree) that over time, people become more resistant to change. Set in their ways, determined to protect their \\"comfort\\" and \\"custom.\\"<br />From my own perspective, entrenched views tend to fall within one of three categories: Those which remain unchanged by any of the seven factors (or levers), those which are improved (i.e. made \\"more constructive\\") by it, and finally, those  beyond remediation. Moreover, all entrenched views (like nuggets of cheese) have an unsettling tendency to move around -- or be relocated -- by external forces. Therefore, presumably Gardner agrees with me that what he calls the process of \\"deep and pervasive mental surgery\\" should be continuous. Unless and until we understand how and why to change our own minds, it is possible but unlikely that we will be able to change anyone else's.ining, and experience.

Why market differently to women? and How do we get beyond gender generalities to actionable tactics? In her Introduction, she lists \\"Eight Myths of Marketing to Women\\" which, during the course of her book's narrative, she convincingly repudiates. For example, #5: With women, marketing is all about relationships. \\"While it's true that women put more emphasis on relationships -- personal and corporate -- than men do, their purchase decisions and response to communications are affected by far more than `relationships.' From word meaning to word-of-mouth referrals, product priorities to Internet usage patterns, women differ from men in many, many marketing dimensions. And, to overlook their complexities would be to undermine the effectiveness of your company's programs.\\" According to Barletta, there are four components of the women's market: earning power (\\"What's in her wallet?\\"), high-net worth women (\\"the ultimate asset-holders\\"), consumer spending power (the \\"household chief purchasing officer\\"), and women in business (\\"controlling the company checkbook\\").<br />A majority of consumers in the U.S. are women. Research indicates that online spending will increase 26% this year to $96 billion. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy and women influence 95% and make 85% of all consumer buying decisions; moreover, the majority of corporate purchasing agents and managers are women. Female entrepreneurs account for 70% of new business start-ups. If you are still unconvinced of the upside potential of marketing to women, consider these facts:<br />* Between 1970 and 1990, the number of women living alone doubled from 7.3 million to 15.3 million and this pattern has continued.<br />* At least 55% of those online each day are women.<br />* By the year 2010, women will control 60% of wealth in the U.S.<br />* College students were responsible for $210 billion in sales in 2002 and 58% of them were female.<br />* Women purchase more than 50% of the cars and own more than 46% of the homes in the U.S.<br />* More than half of all business travelers are women.<br />In Part II of her book, Barletta introduces and then explains what she calls the GenderTrendsMarketing Model, a systematic and simple tool to help her readers understand, reach, and increase their share of the world's largest market -- women. The model is designed to achieve three objectives:<br />1. \\"Structure the complexities of the gender differences into an organized view of female [in italics] gender culture.\\"<br />2. \\"Show you how gender culture interacts with each of the 12 [in italics] marketing elements [end italics] in the marketing mix.\\"<br />3. \\"Apply the resulting insights to the four stages of the consumer's [in italics] purchase path.\\" FYI, the four are activation through market entry, nomination of purchase options to consider, investigation and decision with regard to nominees, and finally, succession (i.e. repeat business and, hopefully, evangelistic loyalty).<br />Few books fully deliver on the promises stated or implied in their subtitle.

I have never owned such a property but have rented several over the years. Some were rented directly from their owner; others were rented through an agency engaged by their owner. The comments which follow are based on the premise that I have decided to purchase a second home. Let's say it is located where there are two peak seasons, summer (swimming, boating, golf, tennis, etc.) and winter (skiing, skating, snow boarding, etc.) My objective is to maximize rental income from it during both seasons. These are some of the questions I need to answer:<br />1. Where and how to begin?<br />2. How should I finance it?<br />3. Which numbers need to be crunched?<br />4. How to determine which property is the right place for me?.<br />5. Should I have a management company handle everything, use a management partnership program, or self-manage the property? Why?<br />6. Which are the most effective strategies, tactics, and resources for marketing my rental property?<br />7. What about financial terms and conditions (e.g. pricing)?<br />8. Which criteria to use when selecting renters?<br />9. What is the best system for processing reservations?<br />10. Which are the most common problems? How to solve each?<br />Karpinski addresses these and other critically important questions throughout 18 carefully-organized and well-written chapters, followed by seven appendices in which she provides forms (e.g. rental rules and regulations), identifies most helpful Web sites, explains special discounts, identifies vacation exchange Web sites, lists state sales tax offices, refers her reader to learning centers throughout the U.S.  (e.g. to improve computer skills), and concludes with an annotated list of individuals and companies she highly recommends.<br />If you are thinking about purchasing a vacation rental property or if you now own one and are dissatisfied with its ROI, this book will be invaluable. However, with all due respect to Karpinski, I think it would be foolish to rely on only one source of information and counsel. Once again I am reminded of Derek Bok's response when outraged parents of Harvard students complained about a tuition increase: \\"If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.\\" Deciding whether or not to purchase a vacation property obviously requires rigorous and extensive due diligence. In my opinion, a careful reading and then (yes) re-reading of Karpinski's book is essential to that process. That said, check out other sources on the same subject, including books offered by Amazon which have received the highest ratings by readers. This book will also be helpful to current owners who have hired a management company or participate in a management partnership program. In Chapter 5, Karpinski explains why self-management \\"is the only way to maximize your income on your vacation property.\\" For many current owners, that may well be true but only IF they are willing to invest the time and energy self-management requires.nies she highly recommends.<br />If you are thinking about purchasing a vacation rental property or if you now own one and are dissatisfied with its ROI, this book will be invaluable.

(Bonnie and Clyde is a very rare exception.) And historically, the marketing of goods and services has focused almost exclusively on men. Times change. DiVita suggests that at least in terms of online marketing in the 21st century, that is a serious mistake. Why? Because women (i.e. Janes) now comprise a majority of the current U.S. population. More to the point, research indicates that online spending will increase 26% this year to $96 billion. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy and women influence 95% and make 85% of all consumer buying decisions; moreover, the majority of corporate purchasing agents and managers are women. Female entrepreneurs account for 70% of new business start-ups.<br />What we have in this volume is a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective \\"game plan\\" by which to market online to women. DiVita offers the \\"Top 12 Reasons Why Women Shop Online\\" and suggests \\"Six Ways to Get More Women to Buy at Your Web Site.\\" Although at times her narrative becomes somewhat overheated, DiVita's advice is eminently practical and can be of substantial benefit to almost all organizations (regardless of size or nature). If you are still unconvinced of the upside potential of marketing to women online, consider these facts:<br />* Between 1970 and 1990, the number of women living alone doubled from 7.3 million to 15.3 million and this pattern has continued.<br />* At least 55% of those online each day are women.<br />* By the year 2010, women will control 60% of wealth in the U.S.<br />* College students were responsible for $210 billion in sales in 2002 and 58% of them were female.<br />* Women purchase more than 50% of the cars and own more than 46% of the homes in the U.S.<br />* More than half of all business travelers are women.<br />This book will probably be of greatest value to smaller companies. Although they have limited resources, they can use the Internet (and especially the WWW) to compete successfully with much larger companies and even do so on a global basis. According to DiVita, \\"Dickless Marketing is going to help you construct a homepage that search engines and women will love, a homepage that directs both of them to your products page, a homepage that will get the women, at least, spending money. The vital elements of a female-friendly homepage will get women to share your site with every other woman they know.\\"ase more than 50% of the cars and own more than 46% of the homes in the U.S.<br />* More than half of all business travelers are women.<br />This book will probably be of greatest value to smaller companies.

I also agree with Hargadon's emphasis on the importance of an innovation strategy which seeks to take full advantage of what can be learned from the past inorder to create the future. His core concept is &quot;technology brokering&quot; which he introduces and then rigorously examines in Part I; next, in Part II, he describes the &quot;networked perspective&quot; of innovation, explaining how this strategy influences the innovative process within organizations, regardless of their size and nature; finally, in Part III, Hargadon provides specific and practical examples of how various organizations have designed and then implemented technology brokering strategies. Throughout the narrative, Hargadon explores in depth with rigor and eloquence his core premise: &quot;that breakthrough innovation comes by recombining the people, ideas, and objects of past technologies.&quot;<br />In this context, I am reminded of what Carla O'Dell asserts in If We Only Knew What We Know when discussing what she calls &quot;beds of knowledge&quot; which are &quot;hidden resources of intelligence that exist in almost every organization, relatively untapped and unmined.&quot; She suggests all manner of effective strategies to &quot;tap into &quot;this hidden asset, capturing it, organizing it, transferring it, and using it to create customer value, operational excellence, and product innovation -- all the while increasing profits and effectiveness.&quot; Almost all organizations claim that their &quot;most valuable assets walk out the door at the end of each business day.&quot; That is correct. Almost all intellectual &quot;capital&quot; is stored between two ears and much (too much) of it is, for whatever reasons, inaccessible to others except in &quot;small change....there is no conclusion to managing knowledge and transferring best practices. It is a race without a finishing line.&quot;<br />I think this is precisely what Hargadon has in mind when insisting that the future is already here, that the &quot;raw materials for the next breakthrough technology may [also] be already here [but probably] without assembly instructions,&quot; that decision-makers must find their &quot;discomfort zones&quot; rather than remain hostage to what Jim O'Toole calls &quot;the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom,&quot; and that they should build a &quot;bridge&quot; to their own strengths but also to their weaknesses because, as they perform, so will their organization. I agree with Hargadon that innovation must unfold at the ground level, &quot;in the minds and hearts of the engineers and entrepreneurs who are doing the work.&quot; Also, that -- meanwhile -- they and their associates must be guided and informed, not only by their own organization's &quot;beds of knowledge&quot; but also by external sources of information concerning prior successes and failures of the innovation process elsewhere. In the final analysis, there is good news and bad news. First the bad news: &quot;New ideas are built from the pieces of old ones, and nobody works alone.&quot; Now the good news: &quot;New ideas are built from the pieces of old ones, and nobody works alone.&quot;That is correct. Almost all intellectual &quot;capital&quot; is stored between two ears and much (too much) of it is, for whatever reasons, inaccessible to others except in &quot;small change....there is no conclusion to managing knowledge and transferring best practices.

These challenges include providing health care for those unable to afford it, attracting the best teaching talent to the weakest schools, establishing a &quot;universal&quot; living wage, and reforming campaign financing. In 2004, the gross domestic product will be approximately $11-trillion. Based on that, a 2% increase would be $220-billion.<br />Immediately I have questions. Has Miller taken in full account that as much as 85% (if not more) of an annual federal budget is already committed by law to programs such as Social Security and Medicare? Even if the Congress and the President were in agreement about the 2% tax increase and dedicated expenditures Miller proposes, would -- indeed could -- they make them? Even then, where would the (no pun intended) proverbial &quot;buck&quot; stop in terms of ensuring that the increased expenditures achieve the intended objectives? Finally, given the well-established infrastructures of government at the federal, state, and local levels, will an increase (in whatever amount) in a single year be sufficient to solve problems which have developed during the last (let's say) 50 years?<br />No reasonable person can quarrel with Miller's assertion that such problems exist, and, that public officials need to collaborate much more effectively on solving them. I agree with Miller that &quot;our two major political parties are organized around ideologies and interest groups that systematically ban the expression of common-sense ideas that blend the best of liberal and conservative thinking.&quot; Perhaps there is a consensus in 2004 on what the most serious problems are. Historically, however, there has always been disagreement as to HOW to solve such problems and my guess (only a guess) is that political divisions are wider and deeper now than they have been at least since the 1930s and perhaps since the Civil War.<br />For me, this book's greatest value is best measured in terms of the controversies and conversations it stimulates. Miller does not have all the right answers...and doesn't claim to. No one does. In fact, he doesn't ask all the right questions. However, he offers a series of quite specific proposals and then supports them.

In this volume, he correctly insists that responsibility for profitable growth must be shared by everyone involved. He offers &quot;Ten Tools&quot; by which to achieve that important objective. First, he identifies three barriers to such growth: &quot;First, the balance has gone too far in the direction of cost-cutting at the expense of revenue growth...Second, when most managers think about growth, it is in terms of home runs -- the disruptive technology, the new revolutionary business model, the mega-merger -- instead of the singles and doubles that, when executed at a steady pace, cumulatively can increase revenue substantially...Third, improving productivity and increasing revenues are seen as two separate issues, when they are, in fact, inseparable for long-term success. If managers concentrate only on raising productivity, they are only doing half their job.&quot; To these I presume to add a fourth barrier which Jim O'Toole discusses in Leading Change: &quot;the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.&quot; Charan obviously has this barrier in mind when correctly insisting that several mind-sets which endure as received wisdom are, in fact, dead wrong.<br />With regard to the &quot;Ten Tools&quot; which Charan recommends, no surprises there. My concern, frankly, is that some readers will cherry-pick a few, try them, and then &quot;see what happens.&quot; That would be serious mistake. Rather, they should see all ten as separate but interdependent core principles to guide and inform the design and implementation of a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system by which to achieve and then sustain profitable growth. At a time when so many business books are published which offer answers, I especially appreciate Charan's inclusion of several lists of questions which are relevant to or evoked by a specific issue or problem. For example, in the Conclusion (pages 196-198), he poses a series of questions which will help a reader to determine whether or not she or he is now part of a growth business. My own opinion is that these are precisely the same questions which decision-makers in any organization (regardless of size or nature) should frequently ask. Why not dedicate a half-day, select a group of (let's say 10-12 key people), distribute these questions in advance among them, and then meet in executive session to share responses? Then reach consensus on specific action steps to be taken...by whom...with each being assigned a deadline.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Jim Collins' Good to Great, Michael Hammer's The Agenda, Paul Niven's Balanced Scorecard Step by Step, and Chris Zook's Beyond the Core.eral lists of questions which are relevant to or evoked by a specific issue or problem.

Obviously, Silverstein and Fiske have since learned a great deal from responses to their analysis of \\"New Luxury\\": a rapidly developing socio-economic trend as America's middle-market consumers are trading up to \\"products and services which possess higher levels of quality, taste, and [key word] aspiration than [other] goods in the [same] category but are not so expensive as to be out of reach...[trading up to products and services which] sell at much higher prices than conventional goods and in much higher volumes than traditional luxury goods and, as a result, have soared into previously uncharted territory high above the familiar price-volume demand curve.\\"<br /><br />The significance of this paradigm shift continues to have profound implications for literally anyone who competes each day for consumers' attention, consideration, and (most important of all) business. Hence the importance of this revised and updated edition. For decision-makers in most local chambers which do not offer luxury products and services, the challenge is to convince prospects (e.g. for membership, sponsorships, and for placement of advertising) that the total value far exceeds the given cost. (I agree with Warren Buffett that cost is what is charged but value is what a buyer think it's worth.) For example, many people will join a local chamber to \\"trade up\\" IF they perceive that, by doing so, they will then have access to better as well as more extensive networks of business contacts. In this instance, prestige and luxury are synonymous.<br /><br />Think about it. How to explain the spectacular success of diverse companies such as Starbucks, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Lexus and BMW, Williams-Sonoma and Bed, Bath & Beyond, Restoration Hardware, Victoria's Secret, Prada, Coach, Panera Bread, and Callaway? Granted, most consumers cannot afford to purchase everything from companies such as these but an astonishing number of consumers are not only willing but eager to pay a premium for at least a few of the products offered.<br /><br />Why? Silverstein and Fiske offer several reasons. New Luxury merchants never underestimate their customer; they shatter the price-volume demand curve; they create a ladder of genuine benefits (i.e. technical, functional, and emotional benefits); they escalate innovation, elevate quality, and deliver a flawless experience; they extend the price range and positioning of the brand; they customize the customer's value chain to deliver on the benefit ladder; they use influence marketing to \\"seed\\" success through brand apostles (i.e. \\"evangelism\\"); and finally, they continually attack the category like an outsider.

(The Twins won 90 games this past season and had just defeated the Yankees in the first game of the American league playoffs.) As Fraley notes, the Twins are renowned for how they treat their people. One of them is Al Newman who is currently struggling with a life-threatening illness. Here's a brief excerpt from Fraley's article:<br />&quot;When beloved third-base coach Al Newman was hospitalized in Chicago this month because of a brain hemorrhage, general manager Terry Ryan remained with him for the entire 11-day stay. While Newman was hospitalized, the Twins clinched the Central title at home. Manager Ron Gardenshire stopped the postgame celebration, brought out Newman's uniform top and reminded the crowd of what he had done for the club.&quot;<br />If I understand George's key points in Authentic Leadership, both Ryan and Gardenshire offer examples of it. Specifically, they demonstrate &quot;the highest integrity, [are] committed to building enduring organizations...who have a deep sense of purpose and are true to their core values...who have the courage to build their companies to meet the needs of all stakeholders, and who recognize the importance of their service to society.&quot; George addresses what he views as a need for new leadership when in fact the need is to increase the number of authentic leaders, not only in business but in government, religion, and the military. We need more men and women who &quot;genuinely desire to serve others through their leadership...are more interested in empowering the people they lead to make a difference than they are in power, money, or prestige for themselves. They are as guided by qualities of the heart, by passion and compassion, as they are by qualities of the mind.&quot;<br />George invites, indeed urges his reader to &quot;rediscover the secrets of creating lasting value&quot; in literally all areas of contemporary life. On page 6, he poses a series of questions and then in the 17 chapters and Epilogue which follow, he responds to each. However insightful those responses may be, and they are, I think the primary purpose of the questions is to guide and inform each reader's consideration of the various issues which those questions suggest. With all due respect to what George so generously shares from his own life and career, the nature and extent of the reader's own engagement in self-exploration will ultimately determine the value of this book.<br />The material is exceptionally well-organized. The quality of writing is first-rate, and especially effective because of the conversational tone of George's observations and suggestions. Although there are frequent references in this book to &quot;companies,&quot; the questions posed and the issues associated with them are also directly relevant to all other organizations (regardless of size or nature) in which there is a compelling need for authentic leaders. Daily, it seems, there is evidence of such need in news accounts of corruption in all areas of our society. Corporate executives are indicted and convicted of fraud. Officers in the military are demoted, discharged or, in some instances, imprisoned as are clergy in various denominations. Although the reasons for their behavior vary, all of them betrayed the trust of those to whom they were accountable and for whom they were responsible.<br />Authentic leaders are first and foremost authentic human beings. For me, this is George's key point and because it seems so obvious, it may also seem simplistic. On the contrary, he has cut through all the rhetoric and urges his reader to examine her or his core values. For most of us, that is an immensely difficult, perhaps painful experience. In this context, I am reminded of the fact that in TheInferno, Dante reserved the last and worst ring in hell for those who, in a moral crisis, preserve their neutrality. Throughout all manner of organizations, there are women and men who are authentic leaders and should be commended. The reality is, their respective organizations need more of them. More to the point, all of us in our global community need more of them. In his unique and compelling book, George challenges us to join their number.e Inferno, Dante reserved the last and worst ring in hell for those who, in a moral crisis, preserve their neutrality.

In it they introduce an exciting new concept: the balanced scorecard. They have since published three books: this one, preceded by The Balanced Scorecard: Translating Strategy into Action (1996) and The Strategy-Focused Organization: How Balanced Scorecard Companies Thrive in the New Business Environment (2000). Here's some background on the two books before we shift our attention to Strategy Maps.<br /><br />In The Balanced Scorecard, as Kaplan and Norton explain in their Preface, \\"the Balanced Scorecard evolved from an improved measurement system to an improved management system.\\" The distinction is critically important to understanding this book. Senior executives in various companies have used the Balanced Scorecard as the central organizing framework for important managerial processes such as individual and team goal setting, compensation, resource allocation, budgeting and planning, and strategic feedback and learning. When writing this book, it was the authors' hope that the observations they share would help more executives to launch and implement Balanced Scorecard programs in their organizations.<br /><br />Then in The Strategy-Focused Organization, Kaplan and Norton note that, according to an abundance of research data, only 5% of the workforce understand their company's strategy, that only 25% of managers have incentives linked to strategy, that 60% of organizations don't link budgets to strategy, and 85% of executive teams spend less than one hour per month discussing strategy. These and other research findings help to explain why Kaplan and Norton believe so strongly in the power of the Balanced Scorecard. As they suggest, it provides \\"the central organizing framework for important managerial processes such as individual and team goal setting, compensation, resource allocation, budgeting and planning, and strategic feedback and learning.\\" After rigorous and extensive research of their own, obtained while working closely with several dozen different organizations, Kaplan and Norton observed five common principles of a Strategy-Focused Organization:<br /><br />1. Translate the strategy to operational terms<br /><br />2. Align the organization to the strategy<br /><br />3. Make strategy everyone's job<br /><br />4. Make strategy a continual process<br /><br />5. Mobilize change through executive leadership<br /><br />The first four principles focus on the the Balanced Scorecard tool, framework, and supporting resources; the importance of the fifth principle is self-evident. \\"With a Balanced Scorecard that tells the story of the strategy, we now have a reliable foundation for the design of a management system to create Strategy-Focused Organizations.\\"<br /><br />Those who have not as yet read The Balanced Scorecard and/or The Strategy-Focused Organization are strong urged to do so. Brief comments about them in commentaries such as these merely indicate the nature and extent of the brilliant thinking which Kaplan and Norton provide in each.<br /><br />What we have in Strategy Maps are two separate but related components: Further development and refinement of core concepts introduced in the earlier two books, and, a rigorous examination of new ideas and new applications by which to convert intangible assets into tangible outcomes. In the Introduction, Kaplan and Norton explain that their direct involvement with more than 300 organizations provided them with an extensive database of strategies, strategy maps, and balanced scorecards. This abundance of material has revealed a number of strategies and tactics by which literally any organization (regardless of size or nature) can create and then increase value. The strategies and tactics are embraced within three targeted approaches for aligning intangible assets to strategy:<br /><br />\\"1. Strategic job families that align human capital to the strategic themes<br /><br />2. The strategic IT portfolio that aligns information capital to the strategic themes<br /><br />3. An organization change agenda that integrates and aligns organizational capital for continued learning and improvement in the strategic themes.\\"<br /><br />Kaplan and Norton carefully organize their material within five Parts.

For example, Steven Silbiger's The Ten-Day MBA: A Step-By-Step Guide To Mastering The Skills Taught In America's Top Business Schools and Milo Sobel's 12 Hour MBA Program. (Both Silbiger and Sobel know it's impossible to gain the knowledge-equivalent of an MBA degree in 10-12 months, much less in 12 hours.) Each of the their books is worthy of consideration as is this book. In fact, at least to business students and to relatively inexperienced executives, I presume to suggest that all three be purchased and then kept near at hand for frequent consultation.<br /><br />Throughout history, all of the the most effective people were/are life-long learners. They fully appreciate the importance of knowing what they need to know; also the importance of knowing what they think they know...but don't. As a result of all manner of new/better technologies, we now have access to more information than ever before...and both the quantity and quality of that information seem certain to increase faster than ever before. What we know as well as knowing what we don't know are critically important. I am reminded of Derek Bok's response to irate parents after a tuition increase at Harvard: \\"If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.\\"<br /><br />In collaboration with Glenn Rifkin and Victoria Griffith, Kurtzman takes a different approach to various subjects than do Silbiger and Sobel. They provide a specific course of self-directed sequential study whereas Kurtzman provides a series of separate but related chapters, each of which focuses on fewer specific subjects but in greater depth and from several different perspectives. Although I recommend that Kurtzman's book be read sequentially the first time, its greater value may derive -- for many readers -- from its discrete coverage of those subjects of most immediate relevance. Obviously, completing an M.B.A. degree program requires a much greater investment of time, concentration, energy, and (yes) money than does reading one or even several books. Even an excellent volume such as Kurtzman's cannot replace that program, nor does he assert or even imply such a claim.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Silbiger's and Sobel's books as well as Business: the Ultimate Resource, Stuart Crainer's The Management Century as well as his The Ultimate Business Library: The Greatest Books That Made Management, Des Dearlove's The Ultimate Book of Business Thinking: Harnessing the Power of the World's Greatest Business Ideas, Daniel A.

It cited a number of historical facts of which I had previously been unaware. For example:<br />1. In 1637 in Virginia, Ann Fowler was sentenced to 20 lashes after she suggested that Adam Thorowgood (a county justice) could \\"Kiss my arse.\\" The state's General Assembly then ruled that husbands would no longer be liable for damages caused by their outspoken wives.<br />2. During the 18th century in Pennsylvania's Brandywine Valley, impoverished single women with children were required to wear a P (for pauper) when appearing in public.<br />3. In the 19th century during Civil War era, about 80% of the reading public was female.<br />4. \\"In World War II, 1,000 women pilots flew 60 million miles -- mostly in experimental jets and planes grounded for safety reasons --and often towed targets past lines of inexperienced gunners. Then [they] would get arrested for leaving base wearing slacks after dark.\\"<br />As Collins examines four centuries of historical material, much (most?) of it is probably unfamiliar to most readers. In process, she focuses on various \\"dolls, drudges, helpmates, and heroines\\" and their diverse contributions -- both positive and negative -- to the evolution of American history. Although Collins is renowned for her work as a journalist (editorial page editor of the New York Times), she displays in this volume all of the skills of an accomplished historian as well as those of a cultural anthropologist. Also, she's a terrific storyteller.<br />I wholly agree with Ellen Chesler (who reviewed this book in The New York Times) that \\"vast scholarship on women has dramatically reshaped academic thinking about American history....Curiously little of this scholarship has found its way into popular imagination, however, which is why Gail Collins' book is such a welcome development.\\" My own hope is that America's Women will have substantial influence on the revision of curricula for U.S. history courses, especially those now required in public schools. Presumably Collins and Chesler share that hope. The objective would NOT be instruction driven by gender-specific values from feminist perspectives; rather, what Chesler characterizes as a \\"deft and entertaining\\" synthesis of historical materials within \\"a rich narrative.\\"<br />Who knows? If American history courses properly acknowledge, indeed celebrate the achievements of women such as the Grimke sisters, Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, Jane Addams, and Dolores Huerta, perhaps (just perhaps) several of the young women enrolled in those courses will be inspired to make their own contributions at a time when opportunities for America's women are greater than ever before.vision of curricula for U.S. history courses, especially those now required in public schools.

I read this book when it was first published in 1966, re-read it after an unexpected opportunity to meet Alan Watts just before he died (in 1973), and then re-read it again recently after having recommended it highly to a close personal friend. Long ago, I became convinced that the nature and extent of any book's impact are almost entirely dependent on (a) the nature and extent of our life experiences when reading a book and (b) the nature and extent of our ability to absorb and digest whatever that book may offer. Watts's The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are offers an excellent case in point. Frankly, Watts's personal impact on me now is greater than were the first and second readings of his book. At the beginning of our brief encounter, I immediately sensed his stunning intellect and compelling decency. More impressive by far was a sense of his spirituality. It was most evident in his eyes and tone of voice. More then twenty years later, I re-read The Book. What follows is an admittedly clumsy attempt to share my thoughts and feelings about it.<br /><br />First, with regard to the title and subtitle, Watts explains that \\"The Book I am thinking about [and later wrote] would not be religious in the usual sense, but it would have to discuss many things with which religions have been concerned -- the universe and man's place in it, the mysterious center of experience which we call 'I myself.' the problems of life and love, pain and death, and the whole question of whether existence has meaning has meaning in [in italics] any sense of the word.\\"<br /><br />With regard to the subtitle, Watts explains that there is no need for a new religion or a new bible. \\"We need a new experience -- a new feeling of what it is to be 'I.' The lowdown (which is, of course, the secret and profound view) on life is that our normal sensation of self is a hoax, or, at best, a temporary role that we are playing, or have been conned into playing -- with our own tacit consent, just as every hypnotized person is basically willing to be hypnotized. The most strongly enforced of all known taboos is the taboo against knowing who or what you really are behind the mask of your apparently separate, independent, and isolated ego.\\"<br /><br />So, that was the book Watts was thinking about writing, and, the taboo to which he devotes most of his attention (directly or indirectly) throughout the book he eventually wrote.<br /><br />What do I now think of this book? First, it retains its ecumenical spirit but in ways and to an extent I did not fully appreciate years ago. Watts is very respectful of all of the major religions, at least in terms of the common values they affirm; however, he also suggests (and I agree) that those values have been concealed by layer-after-layer of doctrine, policy, and procedure. Watts's point: \\"The standard-brand religions, whether Jewish, Christian, Mohammedan, or Buddhist, are -- as now practiced -- like exhausted mines very hard to dig.\\" Also, I am again struck by the fact that Watts suggests a mindset which is inclusive, tolerant (and when appropriate, forgiving...especially of self), and at all times determined to continue a process of self-discovery. It seems that he wrote this book because he had become concerned about man's alienation from himself (herself) as well as from other human beings and from the physical world within which all of us struggle to achieve (in Abraham Maslow's terms) survival, then security, and eventually self-fulfillment.<br /><br />This is not a book for dilettantes. Watts is quite serious when posing questions so easily phrased but so difficult to answer, at least responsibly. In his view, \\"for thousands of years human history has been a magnificently futile conflict, a wonderfully staged panorama of triumph and tragedies based on the resolute taboo against admitting that black goes with white [i.e. that diametrically opposed forces can co-exist, indeed nourish each other]. Nothing, perhaps, ever got nowhere with so much fascinating ado.\\" Having recently re-read this book, I was reminded of what Whitman observed in Song of Myself: \\"Do I contradict myself? Very well, then, I contradict myself. I am large. I contain multitudes.\\"<br /><br />I am also reminded of the key concept in Ernest Becker's The Denial of Death. He acknowledges that all of us die eventually. Only the suicide decides the circumstances in which physical death occurs. However, Becker suggests that there is another death that CAN be denied: That which occurs when when we become totally preoccupied with fulfilling others' expectations of us.<br /><br />For me, that is the essential point in The Book. Watts concludes with a quotation of James Broughton's observations:<br /><br />This is It<br />and I am It<br />and You are It<br />and so is That<br />and He is It<br />And She is It<br />and It is It<br />and That is That.<br /><br />\\"To come on like IT -- to play at being God -- is to play the Self as a role, which is just what it isn't. When IT plays, it plays at being everything else.\\"<br /><br />\\"Who am I?\\" Alan Watts offers this book which can help to answer that question. However, the inevitably perilous journey of self-discovery can only be completed by each of us. And that journey may require many years of frustration and confusion...without any guarantee that any of us will reach the destination we seek. Our choice. It always was, is...and will be.cinating ado.\\" Having recently re-read this book, I was reminded of what Whitman observed in Song of Myself: \\"Do I contradict myself?

I read this book when it was first published several years ago and recently re-read it, curious to see how well its core concepts have held up. In fact, they seem even more relevant now than they did before as more people, each day, become -- in effect -- free agents.<br /><br />Here's a hypothetical question: How many of those who (let's say) retired five years ago now wish they had read this book when they first went to work full-time? (Yes, yes, I realize that this book was first published in 1997. As I said, a hypothetical question.) As Bridges carefully examines several key issues concerning career manning and management in this book, I was again reminded: If you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there.<br /><br />It may now be too late for retirees but assuredly this book could be of substantial benefit to their children and, especially, to their grandchildren.<br /><br />I share Bridges' fascination with transitions during which new paradigms reveal themselves. Some may involve countries (e.g. those in the Third World), others involve organizations (e.g. Roman Catholic Church, IBM, Nissan), and still others involve human lives. I know of no one else who better understands than does Bridges the probable causes, consequences, and implications of transitions nor anyone else who offers better advice on how to manage them most effectively.<br /><br />In this volume, he focuses on a subject of immediate, indeed urgent importance to anyone now encountering difficulties with managing their lives. More specifically, those who are dissatisfied with their work because it fails to satisfy and/or support them. This book is NOT about finding another job. \\"When you look for a [in italics] job, you are looking for something that is fading from the socioeconomic picture because it is past its evolutionary prime.\\" Bridges goes on to explain, \\"This book is a do-it-yourself career development program....[Rather than seek a job,] a better course of action is to find work that that actually needs doing and present yourself to whoever needs it as the best way to get it done.\\" Bridges offers a practical path toward locating such work and then securing the best terms and conditions by which to do it.<br /><br />He introduces an acronym when developing a key concept in this book: D.A.T.A. (Desires, Abilities, Temperament, and Assets). Thereby, he effectively stresses the importance of<br /><br />* Doing what you REALLY want to do<br /><br />* Developing the skills needed to ensure success as well as satisfaction while doing it<br /><br />* Doing what you REALLY want to do<br /><br />* Developing the skills needed to ensure success as well as satisfaction while doing it<br /><br />* Having an appropriate temperament for the given vocation<br /><br />* Recognizing and leveraging the assets you need (some of which you may already possess)<br /><br />In Part One, Bridges explains (a) how and why the workplace is now changing, (b) why traditional jobs no longer fit this world and why companies are abandoning them, and finally (c) what the alternatives to jobs are. In Part Two, he explains how to \\"mine\\" D.A.T.A. Then in Part Three, he shifts his and the reader's attention to locating appropriate opportunities, creating her or his \\"product,\\" running her or his \\"microbusiness,\\" formulating a plan, and then implementing it.<br /><br />Think of this book as a \\"map\\" which you will need to complete successfully your journey to the destination you seek, whatever and wherever it may be. The value of this \\"map\\" is increased substantially by the questions, checklists, inventories, exercises, and related activities which Bridges provides at the end of each chapter. Obviously, a map is not a transportation vehicle. It guides and informs sound decisions but does not make them. It indicates the nature and extent of whatever fuel may be needed but does not provide it. It remains for the \\"traveler\\" (\\"pilgrim\\"?) to commit sufficient intelligence and energy to the journey. Extending the metaphor further, I also presume to suggest that Bridges expects his reader to be the DRIVER of this difficult but necessary process, not merely a passenger who passively reads his book and nods with approval without taking the requisite initiatives.<br /><br />In essence, this is a book about life management. Oh sure, it will help many to find more rewarding work, rewarding in terms of both satisfaction and income. But if I understand Bridges' key ideas, then I am correct when asserting that his ideas offer guidance to personal fulfillment.

Championship at Sahalee Country Club). Although all four Majors are conducted under the collaborative supervision of the U.S.G.A. and the Royal and Ancient Golf Club organizations, each has its own terms and conditions for participation as well as stages of qualification to compete with those who, for various reasons, are automatically eligible. For me, one of this book's most fascinating subjects is the qualifying process to which many are called but few are eventually chosen. Perhaps only the annual process to earn a P.G.A card creates greater tension and frustration for those involved.<br />To the extent that space allows, Feinstein examines wannabes as well as perennial and promising contenders for each of the championships in 1998. He includes hundreds of vignettes and anecdotes about them, thus giving human significance to the names on the scoreboard. I also appreciate having historical information which creates a context for each Major, three of which have a different course location each year. Only the Masters has a permanent site.<br />P.G.A. golf competition is unique among professional sports in that players are essentially self-regulated, personally assume all costs of participation (travel, accommodations, caddy, etc.), and earn nothing if they fail to make the 36-hole cut. It is not uncommon for one player to prevent another from inadvertently breaking a rule as Tom Kite once did near the end of the final round when he was in contention. Later, Kite was astonished that anyone was surprised by his initiative which probably denied him victory in that tournament. (The player he assisted won it.) Feinstein skillfully captures the flavor and nuances of what can be ferocious competition but also the fact that it is (with rare exceptions) conducted with dignity, style, and grace as well as with exceptional skill.<br />For those who love the game of golf and especially for golfers who are eager to know what it is like to compete in the Majors, this is the book to read. It reads more like a novel than an almanac. It reveals \\"the joy of victory\\" for some and the \\"agony of defeat for others\\" while celebrating certain values which seem to have become less common each day...except on a golf course. For whatever it may be worth, over the years I have played probably 500 rounds of golf on several dozen different golf courses (both public and private) and do not remember a single \\"ugly\\" encounter with another player. Having said that, I feel obliged to point out that \\"golf\\" is \\"flog\\" spelled backwards. On numerous occasions, it really has been for me \\"a good walk spoiled\\" but my passion for the game and my respect for those who play it so well remain undiminished.<br />Beginning in 1960, Theodore H. White wrote several \\"The Making of the President\\" accounts. I was reminded of that as I read this book, wishing that Feinstein or another author of comparable talent would write an annual volume in (let's call it) \\"The Making of Majors' Champions\\" series. This would enable avid golfers such as I to return in time to memorable moments during past Majors competition. End-of-year DVDs featuring such moments plus commentaries among special features would also be much appreciated. Meanwhile, we have Feinstein's lively as well as informative book which recreates (to the extent a text can) stirring triumphs by O'Meara, Janzen, and Singh as well as dozens of other human subplots associated with those victories eight years ago.y, style, and grace as well as with exceptional skill.<br />For those who love the game of golf and especially for golfers who are eager to know what it is like to compete in the Majors, this is the book to read.

I was stewing about that as I read this book, learning a great deal about several authentically remarkable Americans. Its title is somewhat misleading. Most of those discussed by Randall and Nehra have not been \\"forgotten\\"; rather, most are unfamiliar to most readers. For example: Anne Marbury Hutchinson, Tom Quick, Margaret Shippen Arnold, Charles Grandison Finney, Charlotte Forten, and Louis Sockalexis. (Other than Jefferson, obviously, I recognized Myra Colby Bradwell because I attended an elementary school in Chicago named after her. I also had a dim idea of Tadeusz Kosciuszko's importance to the American Revolution.) Point is, each of those discussed deserves appreciation which, to date, has been denied them. Randall and Nahra have written a book which (hopefully) will address that neglect. More importantly, they have helped those who read this book to gain a much greater appreciation of the scope, depth, and diversity of the human context of this nation's creation and development over a period of more than two centuries. Also, readers are reminded of the obvious (but not always acknowledged) fact that most of the authentic heroes and heroines throughout any nation's history are, in effect, anonymous. Except for their family members and a few friends, no one will remember them because no one knew or knew of them.<br />In any event, I enjoy books which provide important information of which I was not previously aware. For example, James W. Loewen' Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong and Richard Shenkman's Legends, Lies &amp; Cherished Myths of American History. Thank you. Randall and Nehra, for the privilege of being introduced to fellow Americans whom I now promise to remember with respect and appreciation.	2004-05-14

What we have here is a probing and informative analysis of a leadership and management style which provides important lessons to decision-makers in all organizations (regardless of size or nature) which currently struggle to compete successfully in their respective marketplaces. In a sense, the same skills required by a successful turnaround are also valuable in organizations which are currently prospering: \\"Be transparent and explain yourself in clear, lucid terms. Do as you say you are going to do. Listen first; then think.\\" Prior to being reassigned by Renault to the Nissan organization, Ghosn had led the revivals of Michelin South America, Michelin North America, and Renault. According to Magee, he \\"may be the only person to have four verifiable corporate turnaround efforts on four different continents.\\" Serious problems had developed at Nissan in the early 1990s. How serious? It was \\"strapped by $22-billion in debt, inflated supplier costs, and new product development that was at a standstill.\\" This book explains how, under Ghosn's leadership, Nissan not only solved those and other problems; it regained a position of profitable and prominent leadership in one of the most competitive of industries.<br />As indicated previously, Ghosn is a firm believer in transparency throughout all areas and at all levels of an organization. For that reason, prior to the merger of Renault and Nissan, he created cross-company teams (CCTs) which \\"were charged with finding possible synergies between the companies and exploring specifically how these might work if an alliance was formed.\\" Teams studied product planning, vehicle engineering, power trains, and purchasing. It is incomprehensible to me that Ghosn, a native of Porto Velho, Brazil, could convince those who worked in two such different companies, in cultures with such different values, to work effectively together. He advocated the same strategy which had succeeded so well at Michelin North America: \\"Assume nothing (find answers within the company), work fast, and earn trust and respect with strong results.\\" As American colleague Jim Morton once said of Ghosn, \\"he knows how to get a commitment.\\"<br />Obviously, throughout his career thus far, Ghosn has demonstrated a specific style of leadership and management which Shiro Tomii, a senior vice president in Japan, once summarized as follows: He establishes high, yet attainable goals; makes everything clear to all roles and levels of responsibility; works with speed; checks on progress; and appraises results based on fact. In this context, Magee notes by creating intracompany transparency, \\"only the facts survive. [Ghosn] loves it when data and analysis win and loses his patience when individuals persistently argue a point with nothing to back it up.\\"<br />Once the Nissan Revival Plan (NRP) had restored hope, profits, and confidence in the company, Ghosn focused everyone's attention on NISSAN 180 which involves even more ambitious objectives and requires even greater commitments to achieve them. \\"So questions remain as to exactly how high and how far Nissan will go in its ultimate quest.\\" However, this much is certain: \\"Renault took a chance. Ghosn went to work. And Nissan responded. Together, they changed world business forever.\\"  That is the story which Magee has told in this book and he has done so with rigor and eloquence.th such different values, to work effectively together.

It is important to understand, however, that someone such as Herb Kelleher who has a charismatic personality (and is included among the examples of Charismatics) ensures that associates rigorously examine whatever is proposed to him so that his impulsive tendencies do not result in bad decisions. This is a key point. Your initial approach to a Charismatic should take into full account an interest span which resembles that of a flash bulb: \\"Give the headlines first, stay grounded no matter what, address risks up front, and follow through, follow through, follow through.\\" With a Charismatic, conclusions must come first and delivered as headlines and bullet points. \\"After they've grasped the big picture, they want to immediately talk about implementation.\\" NOW. The way to make your point with a Charismatic is through freewheeling, open discussion. Aha! Got it!<br />But wait. As Miller and Williams then explain, once the Charismatic seems convinced, be prepared for others (probably Thinkers and Skeptics) to protect their boss from making a poor decision. In fact, the boss requires them to do so. She or he knows the vulnerabilities of a Charismatic, as do they. A decision-making process must not be confused with the personality type of the decision-maker. \\"Charismatics expect you to wait patiently for them to make a final decision while they have others pore over the details of your proposal.\\" It would be a mistake, therefore, to assume that the Charismatic's initial enthusiasm (albeit genuine) means that a final decision is imminent and favorable.<br />Miller and Williams identify twelve attributes which are important in how people make decisions: Risk, Responsibility, Competitiveness, Rebellion, Impulsiveness, Persistence, Fear and Uncertainty, Self-Absorption, Playfulness, Education, Intelligence and Facts, and Bargains. Obviously, each of the five types of decision-maker considers (to varying degrees) all of the twelve and then attaches relative importance to them. (See page 11 for a \\"Summary of the Five Styles of Decision Makers.\\") Throughout their book, Miller and Williams explain how to prepare for a meeting with each of the five, then how to conduct yourself during that meeting, and finally how to follow-up. To repeat, decision-making is a process which frequently involves several different people who may well have differing styles. This is precisely what Michael A. Boylan has in mind (in The Power to Get In: A Step-by-Step System to Get in Anyone's Door So You Have the Chance to... Make the Sale... Get the Job... Present Your Ideas) when discussing \\"the circle of leverage\\" factor.<br />It would be a mistake to assume that this book is primarily (if not exclusively) about closing a sale. In fact, its greatest value is derived from what it reveals about effective persuasion which includes but is by no means limited to the sales process. In the strongest possible terms, I highly recommend this book to (literally) anyone who needs to become more persuasive. Thus viewed, this book can be of great benefit to those involved in commerce, of course, but also to educators, clergy, healthcare providers, journalists, public officials...you name it.

Howell and James Oesterreicher as well as their associates were fools to abandon the cultural values and operating principles which enabled the J.C. Penney Company (JCP) to become the most profitable and highly-regarded retail merchandiser in the world. With all due respect to Wal-Mart's executive leadership, JCP's decline was the result of self-inflicted wounds.<br />The \\"inside look\\" Hare provides is less the result of any privileged access he had than the willingness of those who did have such access to share their reactions to (and explanations of) their beloved company's deterioration. These insiders felt betrayed. More in sadness than in anger, they shared with Hare directly or through other sources their thoughts and feelings about JCP which \\"had shifted from being a company of merchants to an organization of managers, with its focus changing from serving customers and communities to maximizing sales and profits. Finally [during the regimes of Howell and Oesterreicher], the actions of its leadership became both soulless and silly.\\"<br />To appreciate what JCP had lost, Hare carefully explains what JCP once had. Rather than glorify James Cash Penney himself, Hare duly acknowledges the founder's importance while suggesting -- with all due respect to him, \\"The Body of Doctrine\\" (page 36), and \\"H.C.S.C.\\" (page 37) -- that others deserve most of the credit for leading JCP to greatness, both as a retail merchant and as a human community. They include Jack Maynard, Earl Sams, Don Seibert, and Walt Neppl.<br />In this context, I am reminded of David Glass and Lee Scott. When Glass became CEO of Wal-Mart in 1992, the company was doing $43.8 billion in sales. Just three years later, under his leadership, sales hit $100 billion. According to Robert Slater, Glass &quot;took Wal-Mart out of Middle America and made it into a global brand.&quot; Glass and his colleagues stayed true to Walton's idiosyncratic management style while investing in the technologies and logistics operations that a multibillion-dollar company needs. After succeeding Glass as CEO while also remaining faithful to Sam Walton's core values, Scott was the driving force behind Wal-Mart's adoption of various advanced technologies which continue to provide a decisive competitive advantage.<br />In this volume, Hare carefully traces a process of deterioration which began when Howell became CEO and he does so with a combination of sadness, anger, and dismay. The historical information and personal accounts which Hare provides leave little doubt that principles and profits are not mutually exclusive. On the contrary, they are interdependent. Mr. Penney knew that in 1902 when he opened the door to his first store, \\"The Golden Rule.\\" We would be well-advised to keep that in mind 102 years later.the technologies and logistics operations that a multibillion-dollar company needs.

There are dozens of books which address many of the same topics and issues and this is one of the best because it was written primarily for non-experts such as I who seek \\"comfort, happiness, and financial security on [our] terms,\\" of course, and need guidance to make appropriate decisions. Answers to questions such as these are more difficult to formulate now than at any prior time that I recall:<br />*  What are the significant differences between standard of living and quality of life?<br />*  Are they mutually exclusive?<br />*  How can -- and should -- \\"wealth\\" be measured?<br />*  To what extent (if any) is there a correlation between personal happiness and net  worth?<br />*  What do the happiest people seem to share in common?<br />*  What are the most damaging misconceptions many people have when  formulating a financial plan?<br />*  Which strategies and tactics are most effective to achieve financial security? Why?<br />*  What are \\"The Ten Commandments of Financial Happiness\\"?<br />Chatzky address these and countless other questions which many of us may have but feel embarrassed to ask. Of course, we can retain highly reputable financial planners whose services are worth every dollar they cost. However, my own experience suggests that a financial planner's best client is a well-informed client. More specifically, financial planners are most valuable once a client has carefully completed exercises such as those which Chatzky includes in her book. Invoking direct address, what do you REALLY want in life? Being rich and being happy are NOT mutually-exclusive. Many people are unhappy because they are essentially insolvent, if not destitute. No savings, credit unworthy, deeply in debt, in danger of foreclosure or eviction, etc. Many others are just as unhappy because of their affluence. They yearn to possess what money can't buy: physical health, peace of mind, friendship worthy of the name, etc.<br />Caveat: Do NOT purchase this book or any other such book unless and until you are wholeheartedly committed to doing the \\"homework\\" required and then to following through on whatever decisions you make. I think that Chapter 6 (all by itself) is worth far more than the cost of the book. However, do you REALLY understand the requirements as well as the benefits of living within your means? Tough decisions may need to be made. (I mean TOUGH.) Do you have what it takes to make them? More importantly, do you have what it takes to stick with those decisions no matter what?

Then and now, their objectives are the same: \\"...to help people become more accountable for their thoughts, feelings, actions, and results; and so that they can move their organizations to even greater heights. And, as they move along this always difficult and often frightening path, we hope that they, like Dorothy and her companions, discover that they really do possess the skills they need to do whatever their hearts desire.\\"<br />In this volume, Connors, Smith, and Hickman invoke once again a core concept of a \\"Line\\" below which many (most?) people live much (most?) of the time. Theirs is the attitude of victimization: They get stuck on a \\"yellow brick road\\" by blaming others for their circumstances; they wait for \\"wizards\\" to wave their magic wands; and they expect all of their problems to disappear through little (if any) effort of their own.<br />What to do? Connors, Smith, and Hickman explain (step-by-step) how to Live Above the Line by assuming much greater accountability for whatever results one may desire. This can be achieved through a four-step process:<br />\\"See It\\": Recognize and acknowledge the full reality of a situation<br />\\"Own It\\": Accept full responsibility for one's current experiences and realities as well as others'<br />\\"Solve It\\": Change those realities by finding and implementing solutions to problems (often solutions not previously considered) while avoiding the \\"trap\\" of dropping back Below the Line when obstacles present themselves<br />\\"Do It\\": Summon the commitment and courage to follow through with the solutions identified, especially when there is great risk in doing so<br />How easy it is to summarize this four-step process...and how difficult it is to follow it to a satisfactory conclusion. (When composing brief commentaries such as this, I always fear trivializing important points.) Connors, Smith, and Hickman have absolutely no illusions about the barriers, threats, and challenges which await those who embark on this \\"journey\\" to accountability.<br />As they indicate in this new edition of their book, they have accumulated a wealth of information during the past decade which both illustrates and reconfirms the importance of making a personal choice to rise above one's circumstances and assume the ownership of what is required to achieve desired results. This is precisely what Theodore Roosevelt had in mind when praising \\"the man in the arena\\" and what W.E. Henley asserts in the final stanza of \\"Invictus\\":<br />\\"It matters not how straight the gate,<br />How charged with punishments the scroll,<br />I am the master of my fate:<br />I am the captain of my soul.\\"<br />Organizations are human communities within which everyone involved must somehow balance personal obligations to themselves with obligations to others. For me, the interdependence of these obligations best illustrates the importance of the Oz Principle: \\"Accountability for results at the very core of continuous improvement, innovation, customer satisfaction, team performance, talent development and corporate governance movements so popular today.\\" Connors, Smith, and Hickman go on to observe, \\"Interestingly, the essence of these programs boils down to getting people to rise above their circumstances and do whatever it takes (of course, within the bounds of ethical behavior) to get the results they want,\\" not only for themselves but also for everyone else involved in the given enterprise.<br />Connors, Smith, and Hickman cite Winston Churchill's admonition, \\"First we shape our structures, and then our structures shape us.\\" Were the Steps to Accountability easy to take, if everyone lived and labored Above the Line, there would be no need for this book. There is much of value to be learned from L. Frank Baum's account of the perilous journey which Dorothy and her companions share. What theyfinally realized -- and so must we -- is that, to paraphrase Pogo, \\"We have met the Wizard and he is us.\\"finally realized -- and so must we -- is that, to paraphrase Pogo, \\"We have met the Wizard and he is us.\\"	2004-04-26

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	5	90	108	N	N	Over Time, an Invisible Treasury Secretary	Whose loyalty to whom and/or what? What is the \\"price\\"? How was it determined and by whom? The subtitle evokes another question: While obtaining his \\"education\\" during his 23 months as Secretary of the Treasury in the current Bush administration, what did Paul O'Neill learn? After research which involved 19,000 documents and hundreds of interviews, Suskind responds to these and other questions throughout the 349 pages which comprise his book. Of course, O'Neill is the focal point but much (most?) of the controversy about this book is a result of Suskind's portrayal of President Bush, in large measure based on O'Neill's comments about him. For example, O'Neill's most widely quoted observation that, during various meetings, President Bush was \\"was like a blind man in a roomful of deaf people.\\" Here's another: \\"I wondered from the first, if the President didn't know the questions to ask or if he did know and just not want to know the answers? Or did his strategy somehow involve never showing what he thought? But you can ask questions, gather information and not necessarily show your hand. It was strange.\\"<br />To me, stranger yet is what the book suggests about Vice President Cheney, a close personal friend of O'Neill's for several decades who was primarily responsible for  his appointment as Secretary of the Treasury. About two years later, Cheney informed him that the President \\"has decided to make some changes in the economic team. And you're part of the change.\\" When Cheney then asked O'Neill to claim that it was his decision to leave public service, he refused. \\"I'm too old to be telling lies now.\\" If the President Bush plays his cards close to the vest, the Vice President seems to keep his locked up in an undisclosed location. In decades to come, historians may well judge Richard Cheney to be his nation's most enigmatic as well as most influential Vice President. \\"We thought we knew Dick,\\" O'Neill observes. \\"But did we?\\" Does anyone?<br />In this book, Suskind seems to take O'Neill at his word, that what O'Neill expressed to him is what he sincerely believes is true when commenting on various people and his relationships with them. Others are far better qualified than I to separate fact from opinion, to separate O'Neill's perceptions from the realities of his tenure. Obviously, O'Neill deeply resents what he views as mistreatment of him while Secretary of the Treasury; he also seems to lament even more his inability to influence the process by which issues were discussed and by which policies were formulated in the Bush administration. He characterizes cabinet-level debates as \\"incestuous amplification,\\" driven more by self-serving expediencies than by principles.<br />Frankly, I do not know how much to believe of O'Neill's account even as I welcome it as another source of information, commentary, and evaluation of the current Bush administration as our nation proceeds into an uncertain, indeed perilous future.seems to take O'Neill at his word, that what O'Neill expressed to him is what he sincerely believes is true when commenting on various people and his relationships with them.

First, that I am avid golfer and thus have a special interest in this volume, one of several in a series. Also, I am a long-time subscriber to The New Yorker and had already seen most of Robert Mankoff's selections as editor. I just wish I had aged as well as they have. Finally, if you love both golf (which is \\"flog\\" spelled backwards) and a good laugh, and no one else has as yet purchased The New Yorker Book of Golf Cartoons for you, don't begin dropping hints resembling anvils and then eagerly await the next birthday, anniversary, or holiday. Treat yourself to a copy TODAY. Amazon enables you to check out several of Robert Mankoff's selections as editor. Meanwhile, here's an excerpt from the dust jacket: \\"Mark Twain called it 'a good walk spoiled.' Lee Trevino said it was the most fun he ever had with his clothes on. For duffers and pros alike, golf can be both a delight and a torment -- often on the same day, sometimes on the same hole.\\" Been there, done that. And, alas, will no doubt do so again...and again...and again.

It offers \\"The Complete MBA Companion in Strategy,\\" the result of FT's strategic alliance with the University of Chicago Business School, INSEAD, the University of Michigan Business School, and the Said Business School at Oxford University. This is the seventh volume in what is identified as \\"The Financial Times Mastering\\" series. It contains articles that first appeared in FT in late-1999.<br />The material is carefully organized within 16 chapters. In the first, there are two essays: \\"Strategy and the delusion of Grand Designs\\" authored by John Kay, Director of london Economics; the second -- \\"Strategy, blind men and the elephant\\" was co-authored by Henry Mintzberg of McGill University and INSEAD, Bruce Ahlstrand of Trent University (Ontario), and Joseph Lampel of the University of Nottingham Business School.<br />As for the final chapter, \\"Fresh Challenges for the Future,\\" it was written by Dan Schendel, founding and current editor the Strategic Management Journal. The reader is advised that \\"This final module sums up the main themes of the book, addresses some of the current controversies, and offers pointers on how the field may develop in coming years. The core message is that those who fail to keep up with the best in strategic management risk losing their businesses and losing their jobs. The cases of failure cited throughout the book underline the point.\\" My own crystal ball imploded long ago so I now cut Schendel considerable slack, given the fact that his comments on \\"fresh challenges\\" were composed five years ago. In fact, I think his analysis holds up remarkably well.<br />Although exceptionally well-written and skillfully-edited, this volume is by no means an \\"easy read.\\" My own opinion is that it will be of greatest interest and benefit to the more capable students enrolled in graduate schools of business, and, to senior-level executives. Of course, the immediate value of each chapter will be largely determined by the immediate needs and interests of each reader. I would be remiss if I failed to acknowledge the superb graphics provided by Graham Parish. I also want to commend, again, Tim Dickson and his associates -- notably Ken Pottinger, James Pickford, Laura Scanga, and various school \\"co-ordinators\\" -- for pulling together so much excellent material, then getting it all properly presented.

I recently read another book in which Lois P. Frankel explains why \\"nice girls don't get the corner office.\\" Probably not until World War II were most adult women in the United States allowed to combine full-time employment with marriage and/or parenthood. Even then, many of the women relinquished their jobs to men after the war ended. They, their daughters, and their granddaughters were again strongly encouraged to accept the role of a subordinate, deferential, compliant, cooperative, \\"Stepford-ish\\" role in the home, in the community, and even in the workplace.<br />According to Frankel, \\"Attempts to act counter to this socialized role are met with ridicule, disapproval and scorn.\\" She goes on to observe, \\"Whether it was Mom's message -- 'Boys don't like girls who are too loud.' -- or, in response to any angry outburst, a spouse's messages -- 'What's the matter? Is it that time of month?' -- women are continually bombarded. with negative reinforcement for acting in any manner contrary to what they were taught in girlhood. As a result, they learn that acting like a 'good girl' is less painful than than assuming more appropriate behavior for adult women (and totally acceptable for boys and adult men.)\\"<br />In this volume, Trudy Bourgeois offers \\"a guide to help women find a place and a voice in corporate America.\\" Presumably for many of those who read this book, her advice will help to achieve those objectives. The book is sensibly organized and well-written. In her Introduction, she offers four practical suggestions as to how to get the most out of her book. I presume to add a fifth which I think is more important than any of the four: Be totally committed to achieving your objectives (whatever they may be) and to investing as much time and energy may be required of you (whatever barriers and obstacles you may encounter). Success demands an effective collaboration of heart, mind, and soul. I agree with Henry Ford: \\"Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.\\"<br />Bourgeois includes a number of reader-friendly sections (e.g. exercises in which to record responses to key points within the text) while urging her reader to purchase a notebook or journal whose sole purpose is to accumulate whatever thoughts, feelings, anxieties, dreams, fears, goals, etc. the reader may have, first while reading her book and then, especially, when attempting to apply Bourgeois' advice...and not only in the workplace. Presumably Bourgeois shares my admiration of what Eleanor Roosevelt once said: \\"No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.\\"<br />I have a few minor quibbles. Yes, yes, I realize that Bourgeois uses the corner office as a status symbol. However, the challenge for any executive (male or female) is to become indispensable to her or his organization. More often than not, however, that will not be accomplished in a corner office; rather, \\"where the action is.\\" Specifically, offsite working closely with clients to serve their needs, solve their problems, and strengthen relations with their customers. Down on the shop floor (or its equivalent) helping associates to strengthen their skills and increase their productivity. Out in the marketplace evaluating the competition, looking for the earliest signs of emerging trends (i.e. paradigm shifts), and cultivating prospective new clients.<br />Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book? Although it was written primarily for women, I think anyone -- male as well as female -- above the age of (let's say) 16 will find substantial value in it. Also, many men in senior-level executive positions will welcome Bourgeois' guidance because they also want to help women \\"find a place and a voice in corporate America.\\" I also highly recommend this book to another group: male as well as female students now preparing for -- or only recently embarked on -- a career in business.<br />... If my daughter were to read this book and then ask me what my own career advice to her would be, here it is: \\"Don't stop with a corner office. Own the building!\\"...me what my own career advice to her would be, here it is: \\"Don't stop with a corner office. Own the building!\\"...	2004-03-24

What we have here is a clever, carefully researched, and highly entertaining discussion of various breeds of dogs and the relevance of their dominant personality traits to male human beings. (Were Jeannette Wright to write a sequel, Women Are Dogs, would she suggest any significant differences between genders?)  \\"Men are dogs?\\" Wright asks. \\"Not when you consider how wonderful dogs are! Written like a dog breed book, Men Are Dogs compares qualities of men to 42 breeds of dogs.\\" I am among those who have serious doubts about astrology. Differences between and among those \\"born under the Pisces sign,\\" for example, can be major and numerous. Not so with dogs within each of the 42 species. Contact the owners of (let's say) 100 West Highland White Terriers and they will describe their \\"Westies\\" in the same terms. That they refuse to be ignored, for example.<br />After explaining why men are like dogs and then how someone can determine \\"the right breed,\\" Wright organizes her material within seven Groups: Herding, Sporting, Hound, Working, Terrier, Toy, and Non-Sporting. For each breed within a Group, she discusses<br />Physical Characteristics<br />Abilities & Interests Training<br />Social Skills<br />Type of Woman<br />Typical [Name of Species] Woman<br />Famous [Name of Breed] Man<br />Here's a brief sample: \\"Collie men are very handsome and catch people's eye. They have a friendly, open look about them and a great smile....[They] are excellent at herding people whether they herd them to ideas, places, or philosophies and beliefs. Gentle herders, most people are not aware they are being herded....A collie man is usually easy to train because he wants to please. He is intelligent and knows how to concentrate. The biggest challenge is his desire to relax and do things in his time frame....In a social setting with new people, the Collie man can be very polite and well mannered. He will, however, take his time getting to know someone....The woman for a Collie man will appreciate his intense need to herd; either her or others. She knows he may move at a slow pace when he's not herding....[One Famous Collie Man is] Matt Damon as John Grady Cole in All the Pretty Horses. As a young man, [he] is eager to escape his humdrum life and travel to Mexico. He wants to work on a big cattle ranch, appropriate to a Collie's herding instinct....\\" You get the idea.<br />Wright is convinced that understanding and considering the dominant characteristics and tendencies of various canine breeds can help a woman to select the most appropriate man for her. Given the fact that approximately half of all marriages in the United States now end in divorce, and about half of those divorces are granted less than two years after the wedding ceremony, obviously some bad decisions are being made. If  Wright's book helps to lower the divorce rate or at least reduce the pain and suffering caused by bad relationships, more power to her. She makes no claim whatsoever that her approach is more reliable than, let's say, the Jung-Myers-Briggs typological approach to personality evaluation which measures a person's compatibility with a prospective mate. Although I am aware of the Jung Marriage Test, I have never taken nor even examined it.<br />In my opinion, this book can have substantial practical value IF used as only one of several resources for evaluation, the others including common sense and shared values. Some of the happiest, most enduring relationships I have observed, however, have involved two persons who could not be more different in several significant respects. My guess (only a guess) is that opposites attract because opposites are intrigued by such differences. Key point: They are aware of them. In effect, this is what Wright seems to be saying: \\"If you become involved with a Doberman Pinscher Man, this is probably what you can expect.\\"<br />Earlier I referred to this book's entertainment value. It really should be prominently placed on a coffee table. Like a \\"Westie,\\" the book's cover and title refuse to be ignored. Those who pick it up and begin to flip through it will soon become engrossed and inevitably read passages  from it aloud. The game is on! In fact there are several which can be played. Game #1: \\"Which breed do you think you are? Let's see what it says.\\" Game #2: \\"That's not you. So, what are you? Let's find out.\\" Game #3: \\"What does it say about the Old English Sheep Dog?\\" and then identify  acquaintances who match up with the description (pages 42-46). Game #4: Sharing responses to items on List 1 and List 2 on page 7. (This exercise could have been the premise for an entire episode of \\"Sex in the City.\\") The responses will help determine a woman's level of experience when choosing \\"the right breed\\" for her.<br />Certain redundancies (e.g. strong herding instinct) are inevitable because several breeds share one or more dominant characteristics. One minor quibble: An Index should be added to the next edition. In all other respects this book is well-written and handsomely produced. The illustrations provided by Mike McCartney are outstanding. This is indeed \\"A Woman's Guide to Choosing Her Breed of Man\\" but men as well as women will enjoy reading it and then sharing it with others.ently placed on a coffee table.

Perhaps you have read one or more of his previous books: Managing Brand Equity (1991), Building Strong Brands (1995), Developing Business Strategies (1998), Brand Leadership (with Eric Joachimsthaler, 2000), and Strategic Market Management (2001). In my opinion Brand Portfolio Strategy is Aaaker's most important work thus far. One of the most popular recent buzz words is \\"portfolio\\" which, insofar as strategy is concerned, is best understood in terms of diversity which creates or allows for options and opportunities otherwise unavailable. According to Aaker, the brand portfolio strategy \\"provides the structure and discipline needed to have successful business strategy. A brand portfolio strategy which is confused and incoherent can handicap and sometimes doom a business strategy. One that fosters organizational and market strategies, creates relevant. differentiated and energized brand assets, and leverage es those brand assets, on the other hand, will. support and enable business strategy.\\" The brand portfolio strategy which Aaker advocates, therefore, creates relevance, differentiation, energy, leverage, and clarity.<br />There is a diagram inside the front and back covers of this book which illustrates precisely what such a strategy involves, and, what the various relationships are between and among its various components. (As I read this book, I found it helpful to refer back to the diagram occasionally as I would to a map throughout a journey. The same diagram also appears on page 17.) I appreciate the fact that Aaker illustrates each of his core concepts by examining various corporations' successes and failures with a brand portfolio strategy, notably Intel, Disney, Microsoft, Citigroup, SONY, Dove, GE Appliances, Dell, and Unilever.<br />After having read the previous sentence, decision-makers in small-to-midsize companies may conclude that the brand portfolio strategy offers little (if any) value to them. That would be a mistake and I apologize if I inadvertently encourage anyone to reach that conclusion. Aaker's quotation of a remark by Frank Lloyd Wright seems (to me) relevant both to the brand portfolio and to almost every organization, regardless of size of nature: \\"Always design [or redesign] a thing by considering it in its next larger context -- a chair in a room, a room in a house, a house in an environment, and environment in a city plan.\\"  That is as true for a family-owned automotive repair shop as it is for General Motors.<br />One of this book's several value-added benefits consists of dozens of quotations such as Wright's which provide Aaker's narrative with tasty seasoning while helping him to clarify his key points. Here are some other quotations which I especially appreciate:<br />\\"Beware of all enterprises which require new clothes.\\" Henry David Thoreau<br />\\"Plans are nothing, planning is everything.\\" Dwight Eisenhower<br />(Eisenhower's observation reminded me of a Hebrew aphorism: \\"Man plans and then God howls with laughter.\\")<br />\\"The best way to predict the future is to invent it.\\" Alan Kay<br />\\"You do not merely want to be considered just the best of the best. You want to be considered the only one who does what you do.\\" Jerry Garcia<br />Whatever their size and nature may be, all organizations really do need to position themselves so as to be perceived in the marketplace as having relevance, differentiation, energy, leverage, and clarity. In this brilliant book, Aaker explains HOW to accomplish that. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Harvard Business Review on Brand Management, Kaplan and Norton's The Strategy-Focused Organization, Godin's The Purple Cow, Finzel's Change Is Like a Slinky.value to them.

Both were thoroughly researched. The completion of each was aided and enriched by dozens of rigorous interviews of key participants. However, there is one significant difference: senior-level executives at Enron (notably Jeffrey Skilling and Andrew Fastow) have been accused and some charged with serious illegalities whereas none of those involved with the merger of AOL and Time Warner have, at least until now.  \\"This is a the story of how two men, Jerry Levin and Steve Case, caused what may be the biggest train wreck in the history of corporate America.\\" Munk goes on to suggest that \\"In broad terms, the disastrous merger of Time Warner and AOL epitomizes the culture of corporate America and Wall Street in the late 1900s.\\"<br />Part One \\"Resident Genius\\" covers a period from Time Inc. to Time Warner, 1923-1998. Munk provides essential background information which includes a penetrating analysis of Henry Luce.<br />Part Two Enter the Internet Cowboys: AOL, 1985-1999. Of special interest to me was Munk's analysis of the working relationship of an odd couple indeed, Steve Case and Robert Pittman.<br />Part Three The Big Deal: AOL and Time Warner, 1999-2000. Step-by-step, Munk traces the process which eventually resulted in \\"the biggest train wreck in the history of corporate America.\\" I was fascinated to learn about the nature and extent of Ted Turner's involvement amidst corporate intrigues which would have made the Medici envious.<br />Part Four \\"Surviving Is Winning\\": AOL Time Warner 2003-2003. The material which Munk presents offers still another illustration of the fact that success has many parents but failure is an orphan. \\"Glued together on January 11, 2001, the company known as AOL Time Warner lasted two years, nine months, and five days before it fell apart....In late 2003, [renamed] Time Warner's stock hovered around $16, down 70% from January, 2001, when the AOL Time Warner deal closed.\\"<br />After reading these four Parts, I proceeded to the Epilogue in which Munk provides an update on several of the \\"train wreckers.\\" Meyer Berlow \\"has found a new vocation: he's a wood turner who spends eight hours a day at a lathe, making wooden bowls and other vessels in his workshop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\\" Jeff Bewes and Don Logan are now the two most powerful executives at Time Warner, after Dick Parsons. What about Case? In January 2003, he resigned as chairman of the company. \\"In late 2003, [he]  opened an office on Washington, D.C.'s K Street. From there he oversees his investments, which thus far have largely been restricted to Hawaii, his native state.\\"<br />For me, Levin is the most interesting. Since the train wreck, he \\"has distanced himself from his past yet again....[and] rarely communicates with former colleagues or associates. `I'm not in the Hollywood community, I'm not in the media community. That's not where I'm looking for my sustenance.'\\" Then where is he? According to Munk, Levin has a new life. \\"He also has a new vocation: the healing arts. Together with his fiancee, Laurie Perlman, a psychologist, Levin is helping to create a holistic mental health institute in Los Angeles, California.\\"<br />Fools Rush In: Steve Case, Jerry Levin, and the Unmaking of AOL Time Warner is first-rate in all respects. Hopefully those who read this brief commentary will be encouraged to read other recently published books which also examine \\"the culture of corporate America and Wall Street in the late 1900s.\\" My own recommendations include the aforementioned Smartest Guys in the Room as well as Kara Swisher's There Must Be a Pony in Here Somewhere, Alec Klein's Stealing Time : Steve Case, Jerry Levin, and the Collapse of AOL Time Warner, Jo Johnson and Martine Orange's The Man Who Tried to Buy the World: Jean-Marie Messier and Vivendi Universal, and Rebecca Smith and John R.

What happened? A question of greater interest to me, what caused all the problems after a century of increasingly greater sales and profits? In this volume, Hays provides a brief but sufficient review of the company's history through 1980 before focussing the bulk of her attention on Robert C. Goizueta's 17 years as CEO until his unexpected death in 1997, and then on M. Douglas Ivester who succeeded Goizueta for only two years until being forced out. In certain respects, Hays resembles a cultural anthropologist as she rigorously analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of the two CEOs as they struggled (with mixed success) to sustain the Coca-Cola Company's market dominance, both domestically and internationally. As she presents her material, I was convinced that many of the problems they faced and some of which they inherited are similar to those which Louis V. Gerstner encountered when he became CEO of IBM. Specifically, a highly political corporate culture, well-entrenched resistance to change, estrangement from customers, and contempt for early-warning signs of imminent deterioration of both prestige and profits.<br />To her credit, Hays demonstrates meticulous care and commendable circumspection when explaining that several of the problems which the Coca-Cola Company encountered during the past two decades were by no means unique as its globalization initiatives proceeded, given internal upheavals in emerging markets and currency devaluations over which it had little (if any) control. It was also among the corporate victims of anti-Americanism which, if anything, has become even more virulent during the last 12-18 months. Nonetheless, one of her central themes is that the Coca-Cola Company was as relentlessly committed to a defective \\"formula\\" for growth worldwide as it was protective of its super-secret formula for syrup. Meanwhile, the company weakened long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with many of its independent bottlers. Some of the most engrossing material in her book examines a number of executive-suite dramas (and melodramas) which suggest, to me at least, an inability and/or unwillingness among senior managers to affirm in their conduct certain values with which the company had once been so closely identified, notably in areas such as corporate good citizenship and strategic partnerships based on trust.<br />Recent developments suggest that current CEO Douglas N. Daft and his senior management team continue to struggle with many of the aforementioned problems and, through their determined efforts, the Coca-Cola Company is beginning to solve them. Hays observes that \\"They knew the formula. They had done it before. They would just have to do it again.\\" Hopefully they will succeed, guided and informed by lessons learned during recent years...lessons which are specified or implied in this riveting account by Hays of \\"truth and power\\" in a company which, for more than a century, has been synonymous with so many of  the \\"best and brightest\\" achievements in the history of American free enterprise.ve of its super-secret formula for syrup.

For more than two decades, Frankel has been advising women to recognize and then stop making various \\"unconscious mistakes\\" which have sabotaged their careers and (probably) many of their personal relationships as well. However, the fact remains that countless men as well as women have made the same mistakes and suffered from the same consequences. True, even throughout U.S. history, society has assigned quite different stereotypical roles to men and women. Perhaps not until World War II, for example, were most women allowed to combine full-time employment with marriage and/or parenthood. Even then, many of the women relinquished their jobs to men after the war ended. They, their daughters, and their granddaughters were again strongly encouraged to accept the role of a subordinate, deferential, compliant, cooperative, \\"Stepford-ish\\" role in the home, in the community, and even in the workplace.<br />\\"Attempts to act counter to this socialized role are met with ridicule, disapproval and scorn.\\" Frankel goes on to observe, \\"Whether it was Mom`s message -- `Boys don't like girls who are too loud.' -- or, in response to any angry outburst, a spouse's messages -- `What's the matter? Is it that time of month?' -- women are continually bombarded. with negative reinforcement for acting in any manner contrary to what they were taught in girlhood. As a result, they learn that acting like a `good girl' is less painful than than assuming more appropriate behavior for adult women (and totally acceptable for boys and adult men.)\\" Two reactions to that brief excerpt: First, my own experience suggests that Frankel's observations were more true 10-15 years ago than they are today. Also, finally (!), we are beginning to appreciate the full value and substantial benefits of what Daniel Goleman calls \\"emotional intelligence\\" in the workplace: nurturing associates, building consensus, empathy, expressing feelings as well as ideas, etc. Traditionally, these values have been more associated with women than with men. With the decline of the \\"command and control\\" management style, in combination with Free Agency (which was in great part a response to that style), males as well as females are expected to develop emotional intelligence.<br />There are two other societal phenomena worthy of note: The increasing number of two-income households and the increasing number of single-parent families. The former requires a different division of labor, of tasks once viewed as gender-specific;  the latter requires one adult to be both mother and father. These two phenomena have done much to invalidate the \\"role\\" which Frankel's describes in the brief excerpt. I also want to suggest again, that Eleanor Roosevelt's statement which Frankel quotes (\\"No one can make you feel inferior without your consent\\") is as relevant to males as it is to females. As the enormous sales of books written by the Twin Doctors (McCraw and Schlesinger) and others have clearly demonstrated, males as well as females are eager -- many even desperate -- for guidance on how to find greater meaning and fulfillment, great joy and satisfaction in their personal as well as professional lives. Self really does matter.<br />Frankel's sensible advice on how to avoid or correct various \\"unconscious mistakes\\" does NOT preclude being a lady or a gentleman. On the contrary, as presumably she would agree, the most highly respected and admired executives are -- by nature or of necessity -- polite, thoughtful, sensitive, and considerate persons. Why? Organizations today heavily depend upon effective human as well as electronic networks. Those human networks are based on trust and comprised of women as well as men, led by those who possess qualities of character and temperament once associated almost entirely with women.ted with women than with men.

Books	5	47	51	N	N	How to Achieve Superior Results in Sales and Profits	Note: The review below is of the first edition that Jeff Thull has since revised and updated in this second edition. In fact, the phrase \\"revised and updated\\" really should be \\"extensively revised and updated\\" because there is so much new material in this book (check out Chapters 8 and 9 in Part III) and the scope and depth of his brilliant Diagnostic Business Development  (DBD) process is increased as he explains how it enables those who use it to get beyond selling to managing decisions in collaboration with the buyer; get beyond problem solving to facilitating beneficial change; get beyond meeting customers' immediate needs to managing their near-, mid-, and long-term expectations; get beyond single transactions to managing multi-dimensional relationships; and finally, to get beyond rote talking points and \\"value messages\\" to rich, rigorous, and interactive conversations.<br /><br />The second edition reflects the positive and significant influence of two books Thull published after the first edition, The Prime Solution and Exceptional Selling. He refines several of their core concepts in the second edition that also reflects substantial feedback that enlightens and strengthens the DBD process. In these and other ways, the second edition is more, much more than a sequel. As I read Thull's Introduction, I was reminded of Ken Robinson's explanation of the reasons for the second edition of Out of Our Minds: \\"...the first reason is that so much has happened since since [2000], both in [begin italics] the [end italics] world and in [begin italics] my [end italics] world...The second reason for this new edition is that I now have more to say about many of the core ideas in the book and what we should do to put them into practice...The third reason is, not only has the world moved on in the last ten years, I have too. Literally.\\" The same is true of Jeff Thull as well as of those such as I who found so much of value in the first edition and so much more in the second.<br /><br />*  *  *<br /><br />Complex sales are those which involve a lengthy process of cultivation and solicitation, a \\"circle of influence\\" within which the purchase or pass decision is made, a product or service whose functions/features/benefits/ etc. require technical verification, and a substantial purchase price. In this volume, Thull focuses on the process by which to \\"compete and win when the stakes are high.\\" To understand how to master the complex sale, one must first understand how and why the role of the salesperson changed throughout the last half of the 20th century. Thull respectfully but clinically explains the inadequacies today of sales strategies, processes, and skills which were effective from the early-1950s until about the early-mid 90s. How well I recall the advice I received from various sales managers when I earned my way through college by selling automobiles and smaller trucks in the Chicago area during summer vacations. Never take \\"no\\" for an answer, for example. \\"Selling begins when the prospect says `no.'\\" Another chestnut was flattery: \\"You look great behind the wheel! This car was built for you!\\" Times change, of course. One paradigm inevitably gives way to another. I agree with Thull that, today, \\"It's not about selling -- it's about managing [a prospect's] quality decisions.\\" Actually, I view that approach as the purest form of selling: to serve as advisor, concierge, consigliere, consultant, etc. when collaborating with a pre-qualified prospect to make the most appropriate purchase decision.<br /><br />Thull carefully organizes his material within ten chapters which range from the first, \\"The World in Which We Sell\\" (almost worth the price of the book all by itself) to the last, \\"A Complex Sales Future,\\" in which Thull agrees with Jack Welch that we must either control our destiny or someone else will. Given what I now do to earn a living, Chapter 6 (\\"Designing the Complex Solution\\") was of special interest to me. In it, Thull suggests that \\"Prime professionals approach [Thull's] solution design  phase of the complex sale as an exploratory process. The aim is to equip the customer to make the best, most effective choice among the solutions competing in the marketplace.\\" By taking precisely the same approach, the IBM sales force was able to recapture most of the customers it had lost while improving its chances when cultivating and then soliciting prospective new customers.<br /><br />As Thull explains, the process built during the Diagnosis, a precise agreement on what a customer is experiencing in the absence of the needed solution and it's financial impact, with a collaborative discussion that determines precisely what a customer's desired outcomes are. \\"The easiest way to begin to define the parameters is to ask customers how they expect their situation to look after the problem is solved.\\" For me, Thull then makes an especially important point when alerting his reader to the \\"trap\\" of unpaid consulting which begins \\"when we cross the line between defining parameters of a solution and creation of the design of the solution itself.\\" Please consult the book for Thull's complete explanation of each phase of The Prime Process.<br /><br />Given the importance of winning in sales, especially \\"when the stakes are high,\\" it would obviously be a mistake to assume that Thull (or anyone else) has all the right answers or is even addressing all of the right questions. My strong recommendation is that each reader rigorously evaluate available sources of relevant information and counsel (including this book), using the same process Thull proposes: Discover what those sources are, Diagnose their relative advantages and disadvantages, Design (or Re-Design) a sales program which is most appropriate to one's specific needs and objectives, and then finally, Deliver satisfactory results through effective implementation of that program.<br /><br />It would also be a mistake to assume that the relevance of the strategies and tactics which Thull endorses is limited, literally,  to the buying or selling of a product or service. Many complex \\"sales\\" can also involve effective persuasion to obtain funds from financial sources, for example, or to convince the best-qualified CEO candidate to accept the position offered. If used effectively in situations such as these, the same strategies and tactics can also be invaluable.<br /><br />In today's increasingly more competitive marketplace, Thull observes, \\"There is no Magic! -- Spectacular success is always preceded by unspectacular preparation\\" as well as by a better system, sharper skills, and \\"above all\\" discipline. The Prime Process is not for every organization, nor does Thull make such a claim. Carefully consider what it involves and, especially, what it requires.<br /><br />I presume to add a final observation of my own, that there is both \\"good news\\" and \\"bad news.\\" First the bad news: Very few organizations have as yet mastered the complex sale process. Now the good news: Very few organizations have as yet mastered the complex sale process.ests that \\"Prime professionals approach [Thull's] solution design  phase of the complex sale as an exploratory process.

As a result, \\"PR\\" now has negative connotations.<br />With regard to \\"free publicity,\\" there has been no shortage of that, as once highly-regarded firms such as Adelphia, Arthur Andersen, Enron, Global Crossing, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Tyco, and WorldCom have clearly demonstrated. Nonetheless, countless other major corporations as well as the reputable public relations firms they retain appreciate the value of effective press relations IF there is newsworthy truth to be told...and told well. What Crilley offers in this 83-page book is a brief but informative explanation of effective press relations from one veteran journalist's perspective. He offers a solid introduction to basic tasks such as determining what is newsworthy, how to \\"package\\" the story, whom to contact, when and how to do so, and how to respond to negative publicity. His style is personal, indeed conversational.<br />Unlike advertising, favorable press coverage is so valuable precisely because it cannot be purchased at any price. That is why competition to obtain it is so intense. All of the \\"barrels\\" in the business world have at least a few \\"bad apples\\" and that is as true of those in the news media as it is of those in public relations, corporate communications, etc. Therefore, it is imperative to identify the most reputable persons whose interests are relevant (e.g. industry specific) and then cultivate relationships with them by earning their trust. Read everything they have written previously. Appreciate the fact that they have a job to do. What do they need to do it? How can you help?<br />All of Crilley's advice is sound. He includes personal observations and experiences to illustrate his key points. I would have rated his book higher had he included at least a few reader-friendly sections, such as check-lists or summaries of key points and (especially) step-by-step guidance on HOW to design and then implement an effective press relations program. Nonetheless, I recommend this book to owners/CEOs/managers of small-to-midsize companies as well as organizations in which there is no one person who concentrates full-time on press relations. Also to those who are now preparing for or thinking about a career in public relations, corporate communications, etc.<br />After reading Crilley's book, I strongly recommend that other sources also be consulted prior to the design and  implementation of a press relations program. There are at least 20 excellent sources identified by Amazon. Check out the Customer Reviews of each and then purchase (let's say) 3-5 to read. Yes, that will require a substantial investment of time and energy. To repeat, unlike advertising, favorable press coverage is so valuable precisely because it cannot be purchased at any price. Investing sufficient time and energy -- as well as a few dollars -- to learn how to obtain such coverage will be well worth it.Appreciate the fact that they have a job to do.

I also agree with Hargadon's emphasis on the importance of an innovation strategy which seeks to take full advantage of what can be learned from the past inorder to create the future. His core concept is \\"technology brokering\\" which he introduces and then rigorously examines in Part I; next, in Part II, he describes the \\"networked perspective\\" of innovation, explaining how this strategy influences the innovative process within organizations, regardless of their size and nature; finally, in Part III, Hargadon provides specific and practical examples of how various organizations have designed and then implemented technology brokering strategies. Throughout the narrative, Hargadon explores in depth with rigor and eloquence his core premise: \\"that breakthrough innovation comes by recombining the people, ideas, and objects of past technologies.\\" <br />In this context, I am reminded of what Carla O'Dell asserts in If We Only Knew What We Know when discussing what she calls \\"beds of knowledge\\" which are \\"hidden resources of intelligence that exist in almost every organization, relatively untapped and unmined.\\" She suggests all manner of effective strategies to \\"tap  into \\"this hidden asset, capturing it, organizing it, transferring it, and using it to create customer value, operational excellence, and product innovation -- all the while increasing profits and effectiveness.\\" Almost all organizations claim that their \\"most valuable assets walk out the door at the end of each business day.\\" That is correct. Almost all intellectual \\"capital\\" is stored between two ears and much (too much) of it is, for whatever reasons, inaccessible to others except in \\"small change....there is no conclusion to managing knowledge and transferring best practices. It is a race without a finishing line.\\" <br />I think this is precisely what Hargadon has in mind when insisting that the future is already here, that the \\"raw materials for the next breakthrough technology may [also] be already here [but probably] without assembly instructions,\\" that decision-makers must find their \\"discomfort zones\\" rather than remain hostage to what Jim O'Toole calls \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom,\\" and that they should build a \\"bridge\\" to their own strengths but also to their weaknesses because, as they perform, so will their organization. I agree with Hargadon that innovation must unfold at the ground level, \\"in the minds and hearts of the engineers and entrepreneurs who are doing the work.\\" Also, that -- meanwhile -- they and their associates must be guided and informed, not only by their own organization's \\"beds of knowledge\\" but also by external sources of information concerning prior successes and failures of the innovation process elsewhere. In the final analysis, there is good news and bad news. First the bad news: \\"New ideas are built from the pieces of old ones, and nobody works alone.\\" Now the good news: \\"New ideas are built from the pieces of old ones, and nobody works alone.\\"	2004-03-08

In this volume, somewhat of a departure from his usual concerns, he shares some excellent ideas about the thinking process itself. He asserts (and I wholly agree) that successful people think differently than do unsuccessful people. Specifically, he identifies and then carefully examines eleven different types of thinking. \\"Those who embrace good thinking as a lifestyle,\\" he suggests, \\"understand the relationship between their level [and quality] of thinking and their level [and degree] of progress. They also realize that to change their lives, they must change their thinking.\\" Agreeing with Abraham Maslow, Maxwell suggests that unsuccessful people focus their thinking almost entirely on survival, average people focus their thinking almost entirely on \\"maintenance' (i.e. keeping whatever they now have), and successful people focus their thinking entirely on progress.<br />Maxwell devotes a separate chapter to each of the eleven types of thinking: Big Picture, Focussed, Creative, realistic, Strategic, Possibility/Potentiality, Reflective, Popular (thinking which creates agreement, consensus, teamwork, etc.), Shared/Collaborative, Unselfish, and Bottom-line. According to Maxwell, his book \\"does not try to tell you what to think; it attempts to teach you [in italics] how to think.\\" At the conclusion of each chapter, he thoughtfully includes a brief exercise which requires the reader to apply the key points in the chapter to her or his own circumstances. I have no problem with the fact that there is some redundancy in Maxwell's presentation of material. First of all, the eleven types of thinking are interrelated, interdependent. Strengthening one inevitably helps to strengthen the others. Also, certain key points need to be reiterated for purposes of both review and emphasis. Presumably Maxwell agrees with me that there is a compelling need for new thinking about how to change one's way of thinking. Metaphorically, we need both new wine AND new bottles but also new, better ideas about the process of producing wine.<br />Paradoxically, as the prophet Eccelesiastes asserts, \\"there is nothing new under the sun.\\" I am not damning with faint praise when suggesting that there is (essentially) nothing new in Maxwell's book. Almost all of the key concepts in this book can be found in the works of Aristotle, Marcus Aurelius, Immanuel Kant, William James, and others. (Maxwell duly acknowledges a wealth of resources.) For me, the great value of this book is not derived from any original insights offered by Maxwell; rather, from his brilliant organization and presentation of essentially fundamental ideas about the process of thinking clearly on so many different levels, from so many different points of view. This may well prove to be his most important contribution to our understanding of what can and should be accomplished by more effective use of the abundant resources which are already available...between our two ears.to change one's way of thinking.

In fact, apparently wishing to demonstrate the improvisational approach of a jazz musician, he plays fast and loose with all manner of generalizations about creativity without developing any of the ideas in depth. The core concept is clever: Kao asserts that there similarities between a jam session during which jazz music is performed and a brainstorm session during which new ideas about doing business are generated and evaluated. Had he developed that concept in an article for publication in a business journal, it may well have attracted much more favorable responses than has his book. What's the problem? Actually, I think there are two. First, in terms of innovative thinking, Kao's Jamming suffers significantly in contrast with other books written by authors such as James L. Adams, Guy Claxton, Edward de Bono, Doug Hall, Lynne Levesque, Michael Michalko, Roger Von Oech, Michael Ray and Rochelle Myers, Joey Reiman, and Stephen Shapiro. Also, it is unclear (at least to me) how anyone can proceed from various general ideas in Jamming to specific applications of them in the business world. For example, \\"Success depends on your ability to infuse, imbue, and instill a respect for and belief in the power of creativity throughout your organization.\\" O.K. but how? \\"The first step in making your company a happening place [sic] is to kick out the crutches that support a creativity-deadening culture.\\" O.K. but how? Eliminate reliance on \\"obfuscating paper....Throw away the sheet music. Start creative conversations.\\" Obviously, this brief excerpt is taken out of context but upon close examination, the context itself is fuzzy. At one point, Kao quotes Jerry Welch, a former American Express executive: \\"The most important precondition for creativity is to believe in it.\\" O.K. but then what? \\"Belief also begets discipline.\\" Mind you, I am not disagreeing with any of Kao's various prescriptions. Once acknowledging their validity,  I just don't understand what specifically he would have his reader do with them.Belief also begets discipline.\\" Mind you, I am not disagreeing with any of Kao's various prescriptions.

There is another, Business: the Ultimate Resource (Daniel Goleman is among its 30+ editors) published by Perseus, whose scope and depth of coverage include original best-practice essays from over 150 of today's thought leaders; profiles of the 100 most influential business pioneers and management thinkers; summaries of the 70 most important business books of all time; more than 300 practical checklists which cover all areas of management and career development; a first-class world business almanac covering more than 150 countries, all 50 US states, and 24 industries; a jargon-free dictionary of 6,000 business terms; and an extensive list of 3,000 information sources (books, journals, Web sites and organizations), covering 115 topics. It is, in a word, more comprehensive than is Des Dearlove's book.<br /><br />That said, I hope my personal opinion does not deter anyone from purchasing his book which also has much to commend it and for a fraction of the cost of Business: the Ultimate Resource. (Also, Dearlove's book is much easier to lift.) His focus is on \\"the world's greatest business ideas\\" which are arranged in an alphabetical sequence, beginning with \\"Action Learning\\" and concluding with \\"The Virtual Organization.\\" Dearlove's criteria for selection are eminently sensible: Ideas which are timely, self-contained, have real world credibility, possess and require intellectual rigor, are simple (back to that point in a moment), and practical. There is an especially clever use of graphics to organize/present information such as two \\"Snapshots\\" on pages xvii and xix in the Introduction which identify post-war concepts during 1950-1979 and 1980-1999, respectively. Dearlove also includes an \\"Ideas into action\\" section in each chapter which provides brief explanations of key concepts as well as suggested do's and don'ts, action steps, etc. Very helpful, especially when periodically reviewing a given chapter.<br /><br />In The Management Century, Stuart Crainer devotes an entire chapter to each of ten decades. Here are the subjects he covers during the 1900-1950 period:<br /><br />1900-1910: Stopwatch Science [e.g. Elihu Root, Henri Fayol, and Frederick Winslow Taylor]<br /><br />1911-1920: Modern Times [e.g. Henry Ford, Frank & Lilian Gilbreth]<br /><br />1921-1930: Discovering the Organization [e.g. Max Weber, Chester Barnard, Billy Durant, and Alfred Pritchard Sloan Jr.]<br /><br />NOTE: Throughout the book, Crainer inserts his own comments. For example: \\"Taylor discovered work. Ford discovered work on a massive scale. Sloan organized work. And no one discovered the people doing the work.\\" That is, until the 1930s....<br /><br />1931-1940: Discovering People [e.g. Mary Parker Follett, Bill Hewlett & David Packard]<br /><br />1941-1950: Lessons in War [e.g. William S. Knudsen, Walter Shewhart, Akio Morita, Konosuke Matsushita] Note that, in 1950, Peter Drucker becomes professor of manager at New York University. \\"The first person anywhere in the world to have such a title and to teach such a subject,\\" he later said.<br /><br />In my opinion, Crainer's book would be an excellent companion for Dearlove's book. Although the two authors take quite different approaches as they cover different subjects, both focus primarily on the most important, hence most influential business ideas. Although Crainer limits his attention to the 20th century, he would be the first to agree with Dearlove that many of the so-called \\"modern ideas\\" were originally introduced centuries ago. With regard to the selection criterion \\"simplicity,\\" I am reminded of Albert Einstein's suggestion that we develop ideas as simple as possible \\"but no simpler.\\" In this volume, Dearlove makes an earnest and effective effort to follow that principle. He thereby helps his reader to grasp \\"the world's greatest business ideas\\" without, to his credit, compromising their intellectual integrity. Case in point: The Balanced Scorecard. He duly acknowledges the work of Robert Kaplan and David Norton who first introduced TBS in an article published in the Harvard Business Review in 1993. Dearlove then synthesizes several key points when suggesting that four different perspectives must be established in proper balance: those of the customer, internal, innovation and learning, and finally financial. Properly devised, Dearlove notes, TBS will reveal and support appropriate cause-and-effect relationships, possess a combination of lead and lag indicators, and be linked to financial measurement. (Please see pages 18- 21.) In this instance and throughout his book, Dearlove makes it as simple as possible \\"but no simpler\\" for his reader to grasp ideas such as The Balanced Scorecard.

Truman on Leadership	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Lessons on Doing Your Damndest	Those who have read Patton on Leadership and/or Elizabeth I, CEO are already aware of Axelrod's unique talent for rigorously examining an abundance of historical and (especially) biographical information to derive especially important lessons in leadership. In this volume, his subject is Harry S Truman. (How much I would enjoy being included during a \\"fantasy dinner\\" with Patton, Elizabeth I, and Truman!) Within a dozen chapters, Axelrod identifies and then briefly but insightfully discusses 156 \\"lessons\\" to be learned from the life and career of the 33rd President of the United States. Axelrod also provides a \\"Truman Timeline\\" and \\"The Sources of Truman on Leadership\\" (suggested readings) in an Appendix.<br />Most experts on the American Presidency rank Truman among the greatest, a fact which would have astonished those old enough to remember when Franklin Delano Roosevelt died and Truman was sworn in as his successor. There was little in the background of \\"The Man from Missouri\\" to suggest that he was equal to the task during one of the most dangerous periods of his nation's history. World War Two was still in progress, what became the Cold War was developing, West Berlin would soon be isolated by the U.S.S.R.'s blockade, the Korean War lay ahead, and the quite legitimate threat of thermonuclear weapons created an unprecedented sense of menace throughout the civilized world. Truman did indeed rise to the task and as Axelrod correctly indicates in this volume, there are many important lessons to be learned from his leadership from 1945 until 1952.	2004-03-01

In it they introduce an exciting new concept: the balanced scorecard. They have since published three books: this one, preceded by The Balanced Scorecard: Translating Strategy into Action  (1996) and The Strategy-Focused Organization: How Balanced Scorecard Companies Thrive in the New Business Environment (2000). Here's some background on the two books before we shift our attention to Strategy Maps.<br />In The Balanced Scorecard, as Kaplan and Norton explain in their Preface, \\"the Balanced Scorecard evolved from an improved measurement system to an improved management system.\\" The distinction is critically important to understanding this book. Senior executives in various companies have used the Balanced Scorecard as the central organizing framework for important managerial processes such as individual and team goal setting, compensation, resource allocation, budgeting and planning, and strategic feedback and learning.  When writing this book, it was the authors' hope that the observations they share would help more executives to launch and implement Balanced Scorecard programs in their organizations. <br />Then in The Strategy-Focused Organization, Kaplan and Norton note that, according to an abundance of research data, only 5% of the workforce understand their company's strategy, that only 25% of managers have incentives linked to strategy, that 60% of organizations don't link budgets to strategy, and 85% of executive teams spend less than one hour per month discussing strategy. These and other research findings help to explain why Kaplan and Norton believe so strongly in the power of the Balanced Scorecard. As they suggest, it provides \\"the central organizing framework for important managerial processes such as individual and team goal setting, compensation, resource allocation, budgeting and planning, and strategic feedback and learning.\\" After rigorous and extensive research of their own, obtained while working closely with several dozen different organizations, Kaplan and Norton observed five common principles of a Strategy-Focused Organization:<br />1. Translate the strategy to operational terms<br />2. Align the organization to the strategy<br />3. Make strategy everyone's job<br />4. Make strategy a continual process<br />5. Mobilize change through executive leadership<br />The first four principles focus on the the Balanced Scorecard tool, framework, and supporting resources; the importance of the fifth principle is self-evident. \\"With a Balanced Scorecard that tells the story of the strategy, we now have a reliable foundation for the design of a management system to create Strategy-Focused Organizations.\\"<br />Those who have not as yet read The Balanced Scorecard and/or The Strategy-Focused Organization are strong urged to do so. Brief comments about them in commentaries such as these merely indicate the nature and extent of the brilliant thinking which Kaplan and Norton provide in each.<br />What we have in Strategy Maps are two separate but related components: Further development and refinement of core concepts introduced in the earlier two books, and, a rigorous examination of new ideas and new applications by which to convert intangible assets into tangible outcomes. In the Introduction, Kaplan and Norton explain that their direct involvement with more than 300 organizations provided them with an extensive database of strategies, strategy maps, and balanced scorecards. This abundance of material has revealed a number of strategies and tactics by which literally any organization (regardless of size or nature) can create and then increase value. The strategies and tactics are embraced within three targeted approaches for aligning intangible assets to strategy:<br />\\"1. Strategic job families that align human capital to the strategic themes<br />2. The strategic IT portfolio that aligns informationcapital to the strategic themes<br />3. An organization change agenda that integrates and aligns organizational capital for continued learning and improvement in the strategic themes.\\"<br />Kaplan and Norton carefully organize their material within five Parts. I presume to suggest that Part I be read and then re-read before proceeding to Value-Creating Processes, Intangible Assets, and Building Strategies and Strategy Maps. Part Five provides a number of case files generated by private-sector, public-sector, and nonprofit organizations. In fact, I strongly suggest that Chapter 2 be re-read several times because it offers an invaluable primer on strategy maps. When reading and then re-reading Chapter 2, be sure to check back on Figure 1-2 (Page 8) and Figure 1-3 (Page 11) in the Introduction.<br />One word of caution from Kaplan and Norton: \\"It is important (if not imperative) to describe an organization's strategy with word statements of strategic objectives in the four linked perspectives BEFORE turning to measurements. Many organizations building BSCs attempt to go directly from somewhat vague strategy statements to measures without this step, and often omit critical aspects of the strategy or else select from measures that are already available, rather than selecting measures that quantify their strategic objectives.\\"<br />This is a much longer review than I usually compose because I am convinced that only what is measurable is manageable. Also because, after extensive prior experience helping corporate clients with formulating process maps of various kinds, I am convinced that organizational \\"journeys\\" to increased sales, profits, and value need maps by which to reach those destinations just as those who drive vehicles do when seeking their own destinations. One of the greatest benefits of strategy maps is that the process by which they are devised helps to ensure that the most appropriate destination is identified. Think of Kaplan and Norton as travel agents and cartographers, to be sure, but also as consultants whose services you can retain merely by purchasing their three books, then by absorbing and digesting the information and counsel those three books provide. For many decision-makers in all manner of organizations, Strategy Maps may well prove to be the most valuable business book they ever read.	2004-02-27

He greets you warmly at the door and offers to give you a complete tour, during which he identifies all manner of \\"tools\\" and carefully explains how to use each. He realizes that you don't need all of them, at least not NOW, but correctly observes that you should be fully aware of all the \\"tools\\" that are available. There are 17 different departments in his store. After you complete your tour, you select (with his assistance) those \\"tools\\" which are most appropriate to your organization's current needs.<br />This book is your toolkit. Just as you would become thoroughly familiar with what Lipe's Executive Hardware Store offers, you should become thoroughly familiar with all of this book's contents which are carefully organized within 17 chapters. Some executives will read a book and then attempt to apply immediately everything they have learned from it. Other executives make an equally bad mistake: Because all they have is a \\"hammer,\\" they see every task as a \\"nail.\\" Hence the importance of having a variety of different tools, knowing not only how but when to use each of them effectively. As needs change, so must the resources which are allocated to meet those needs.<br />Here is Lipe's definition of marketing: \\"...a process where everyone [underlined] in the company pursues actions, at designated points, to increase sales, grow profits and deepen relationships.\\" My own is much simpler: Marketing is the process by which to create or increase demand for whatever one offers. I could not agree more, however, with his assertion that everyone (literally everyone) in any organization must be involved in marketing because people do business with other people, not with companies, and \\"doing business\\" includes every (literally every) person with whom there is contact each day, both within and beyond the organization. Lipe quotes Drucker's assertion that \\"Marketing is not a function. It is the whole business as seen from the customer's point of view.\\" This is precisely what Warren Buffett had in mind when asserting that \\"Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.\\" Customers' perceptions of value are in fact the ultimate realities of the marketing process.<br />Although Lipe's book does indeed provide \\"tips, techniques and tools\\" to improve current marketing efforts, it can also provide an essential source of information and guidance when formulating a marketing plan for the first time. His book can also be of substantial benefit to those now preparing for a career in business even if they do not plan to specialize (if that's the word) in marketing. They must realize that, as noted earlier, everyone (literally everyone) in a given organization is directly or at least indirectly involved with marketing. Once you have read this book, you are urged to check out Lipe's \\"Recommended Resources\\" and &quot;Websites for Marketers\\" sections (pages 241-244), both of which would be even more helpful had Lipe also provided brief comments on resources identified. There is one significant omission: Theodore Levitt's The Marketing Imagination, based on his earlier article \\"Marketing Myopia\\" which appeared in the Harvard Business Review.as seen from the customer's point of view.\\" This is precisely what Warren Buffett had in mind when asserting that \\"Price is what you pay.

Most of them are (or were) CEOs of major corporations and associated with Spencer Stuart's CEO Academy. As Carey and Von Weichs explain, \\"we suggested to each of the contributors that they address their topic as if it were the advice they wished they had received when they first started their job.\\" I cannot recall a prior period in the history of American business when the position of CEO was more challenging than it is today. Consider this statistic: Between 1999 and 2001, 57% of the largest companies in the United States removed their CEOs. Daily it seems, we learn of other CEOs who has been forced to resign or are under tremendous pressure to improve their performance. Meanwhile, still other CEOs are indicted for various crimes.<br />\\"Two recent developments have fundamentally changed the rules of the game for chief executives. The first is a series of high-profile cases of corporate malfeasance that came to public attention beginning in the fall of 2001...The other development that has significantly changed the lives of CEOs is the noisy crash of the stock market and the accompanying bursting of the tech and telecom bubble.\\" The best of recently published business books address an especially important question. For Carey and Von Weichs: \\"Where can an executive turn when seeking training and advice on how to lead and manage a company?\\" Answers vary, of course. What Carey and Von Weichs attempt to do in this book is to create access -- for as many executives as possible -- to what has been \\"an immense and untapped body of knowledge\\" which resides among seasoned and retired CEOs \\"who have been working in the trenches for many years.\\"<br />Carey and Von Weichs organize their material within four Parts: Management and Leadership in the Midst of Change; Governance: The Board of Directors and Its CEO; Operational Excellence and the Pursuit of Strategy; and finally, The CEO and the Outside World. Here are four brief excerpts from various essays:<br />\\"A new CEO from outside the company also has to make it clear that some things will not change -- including basic values and ethical standards. When I came to Merck, I felt it was especially important to make it clear that I was totally in line with the values and traditions of the company. This was a matter of personal principle for me -- and something that was recognized by the board while they were recruiting and hiring me. I didn't want to impose new traditions or abandon old ones simply because I was coming in from the outside.\\" Raymond V. Gilmartin, chairman and CEO of Merck &amp; Co.<br />\\"Even when leading from strength, a CEO undergoing fundamental change must prepare for the long haul. The legendary film producer once quipped, `Give me a couple of years, and I'll make that actress an overnight success.' Similarly, a CEO has to realize that real transformation takes real time to accomplish. The biggest reason that corporate transformation is so difficult is that while it is easy to get agreement on what the problem is, the solution is seldom so obvious. People persist in trying to keep part of the old strategy alive, even if that gets in the way of implementing the new one.\\" C. Michael Armstrong, chairman of Comcast Corporation and former chairman and CEO of AT&amp;T and Hughes Electronics<br />\\"Anyone who is a graduate of GE's management training can be fairly accused of being consumed with the pursuit of data. But as I quickly learned, data are even more important in the retail game, given the speed with which you need to make decisions to respond to customer preferences or competitive challenges. Solid measurement systems were also needed to understand our workplace, our market, and the communities we served. To deal with this data in a smart way and make the information part of our short- and long-term thinking, we introduced the SOAR system -- a strategic, operating, and resource planning process -- which lets my senior team think about our strategy in a more organized way.\\" Robert L. Nardelli, chairman, president, and CEO of The Home Depot<br />\\"I strongly believe that one of the key elements of success in investor relations [or relations with capital sources such as financial institutions] is to treat as customers the investors and analysts [or loan officers] with whom you are communicating. IR's job is to service the people who have influence over the company's share price [or working capital], just as the sales and marketing divisions service the people who have influence over the company's revenue.\\" Mark W. Begor, president and CEO of GE Consumer Finance-Americas and former head of Investor Communications at General Electric<br />Many of those who should read this book are owners/CEOs of small, family-owned companies. Begor's comments mat not seem directly relevant to them but, in fact, they are. Over the years, I have worked closely with hundreds of such companies and until I strongly recommended it, only a few CEOs maintained direct and frequent contact (except on an as-needed basis) with her or his company's banker, attorney, accountant, insurance agent, etc. Why not invite them to serve on an advisory board which meets quarterly for breakfast or lunch? Why not see the advisory board as a focus group and/or unofficial board of directors to whom a quarterly \\"state of the company\\" briefing is presented? If you are an owner/CEO of such a company, re-read Begor's essay while thinking about members of the advisory board as the collective equivalent of investors and analysts. Formulate and then implement your IR initiatives accordingly.<br />To repeat,  Carey and Von Weichs asked each of the contributors to address their topic \\"as if it were the advice they wished they had received when they first started their job.\\" For whom will this advice be of greatest value? In my opinion, anyone now involved in business or preparing to do so. Few ever become a CEO but thinking like a CEO substantially improves the chances of becoming an effective senior-level executive.

In fact, as Finzel points out, there are quite a few similarities between them but it would be a disservice to both Finzel and to his book to reveal those similarities in this brief commentary. (Please see page 19.) It would also be a disservice to suggest that Finzel's clever use of the Slinky as a metaphor is essentially all that his book offers. On the contrary, he provides a remarkably eloquent as well as informative analysis of the nature of change itself and the most common barriers, then suggests specific strategies and tactics which can help to overcome those barriers.<br />I especially appreciate Finzel's use of two devices by which to help his reader absorb and digest the material, then take appropriate action: \\"What's the Point?\\" which summarizes the most important points in each of the 30 chapters, and, \\"Takeaways\\" (also at the end of each chapter) which assists effective implementation by the reader of those points. Finzel sees the change process as consisting of several phases. For example:<br />Phase One: Accept the Need for Change<br />\\"Hugely successful and always profitable Southwest Airlines prides itself on three company characteristics: [all in italics] nimble, quick, and opportunistic...Whenever possible, Southwest flies in the face of bureaucracy -- it stays lean, thinks small, keeps it simple...and more.\\"<br />Phase Three: Anticipate Your Adversaries and Allies<br />\\"Forget about the `obvious' benefits when planning your strategy. Assume that everyone but you will absolutely hate your plan, at least initially...When we listen to our opponents, we can learn two things. First, we can recognize the flaws in our ideas...The second thing we learn from resisters is the hidden psychological barriers we have to overcome among members of the group.\\"<br />Phase Six: Align Your Team as You Stay the Course of Change<br />\\"Trust is a nonnegotiable in the world of change. Kill trust and there is no hope for progress until you get it back. Change usually breeds doubt and lack of trust among people in an organization. Without a conscious effort to build trust and maintain trust, all your efforts will fail.\\"<br />What we have here is immensely practical advice for those who are determined to achieve not only specific change(s) but also to establish and then nourish an organizational environment within which everyone involved recognizes and then reacts effectively to change, seeing it not as a peril but as an opportunity.group.\\"<br />Phase Six: Align Your Team as You Stay the Course of Change<br />\\"Trust is a nonnegotiable in the world of change.

As a result, \\"we have achieved only a small percentage of the innovation we could achieve.\\" In this book, Law discusses St. Luke's, \\"the ad agency to end all ad agencies,\\" in which he and his associates keep on developing new ideas. Their perpetual vision is to open minds. \\"And because [St. Luke's] has opened its own and the minds of those who have come to know it, I hope this book contributes to the pursuit of that vision and that you, the reader, husband, wife, employer, human are changed by it in some way.\\"<br />At this point, I hasten to add that Law does not then provide a series of checklists of key points, what to do and not do, etc. His is what I guess could be called a personal memoir whose focus is on a truly unique workplace, the St. Luke's advertising agency in London. It would be foolish -- however -- for any of his readers to use St. Luke's as a model. Worse yet, to attempt to transform their own organizations into clones of St. Luke's. Rather, if I understand Law's objectives in this book (which I may not), he challenges and encourages his readers to think differently about what they do and how they do it, to think differently about the organization in which they do it, and -- in ways and to the extent appropriate -- to redevelop the \\"landscape\\" of their working lives.<br />There are several reasons why I have such a high regard for this book. Here are three. First, Law shares a number of profound insights concerning quality of life in the workplace. To summarize them in this brief commentary (out of context) would, however, trivialize them. Suffice to say that believing in the value of what you do to earn a living and feeling appreciated by others with whom you do it are two of the most important values within a workplace. Second, much can be done to create a physical environment within which to nourish creative thinking. With meticulous care, Law explains how he and his associates at St. Luke's did so. Finally, Law makes an eloquent as well as convincing argument to support his belief that creative ideas about the process of creative thinking are at least as important (if not more so) as the results of that process. Stated another way, creative thinking requires both new \\"wine\\" AND new \\"bottles.\\"<br />Law insists that this is not just a business book. \\"It's also a kind of fairytale I guess because at times I still can't believe it all happened the way it did.\\"  In addition to being an entertaining raconteur, Law also offers a number of excellent insights as to how almost any human community can become a \\"creative company.\\" It remains for each reader to answer various \\"soul-searching questions\\" which Law poses.

In 2002, another 67 did so. Go back even further to the 43 companies which Peters and Waterman quite properly praised in In Search of Excellence (1982). Most no longer qualify according to the criteria by which they were selected...and several do not exist at all. Scary? You bet. Most of us in business can probably draw up a list of at least 15-20 reasons why companies fail. In this book, Ingebretsen focuses on what he calls \\"The Ten Deadly Sins.\\" Committing any one of these \\"sins\\" could easily put a company at serious risk, if not completely out of business. Ignoring Customers (e.g. IBM), for example, or Failed Synergies (e.g. AOL and Time Warner). In fact, most organizations -- non-profit as well as for-profit, regardless of size or nature -- commit one or more of these \\"deadly sins\\" each day. Some violations are the equivalent of a felony, others of a misdemeanor. Presumably Ingebretsen agrees with me that individual mistakes can be damaging but not necessarily fatal; what all organizations must avoid are certain patterns of behavior which ensure failure. I recall a conversation I had years ago with the owner/CEO of a small company which had just filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The situation was hopeless. \\"All of the problems developed slowly and then suddenly.\\"<br />Ingebretsen carefully organizes his material within 14 chapters which are arranged in a specific sequence, beginning with The Deadly Spiral and concluding with Future Challenges. The value of each chapter will be determined, of course, by the nature and extent of each reader's immediate needs and interest. However, Ingebretsen offers an eloquent and compelling explanation of why each of \\"The Ten Deadly Sins\\" is so dangerous after identifying (in Chapters 2 and 3) Early Warning Signs\\" and \\"More Early Warning Signs.\\" Unlike vehicles, companies do not have gauges arranged conveniently in a cluster which immediately indicate when they are going too fast, overheating, running out of fuel, etc. In The Inferno, Dante saved the last ring in hell for those who, in a moral crisis, preserve their neutrality. I thought about that as I read Chapter 13 in which Ingebretsen \\"saves the worst corporate sin for last\\": arrogance. (For example, Enron, Polaroid, and Webvan.) In the final chapter, he shifts his attention to \\"probable causes for business failures in the years ahead, when all companies must run on Internet time.\\"<br />For me, some of Ingebretsen's best thinking is provided in the Appendix: In Search of a Failure-Proof Strategy. However, the value of the Appendix to a great extent depends on how carefully the previous 14 chapters have been read. It is also important to keep in mind that competing on Internet time involves change which now occurs with unprecedented velocity as well as frequency. According to Ingebretsen, \\"the one constant, sadly, is that companies that either can't adapt or refuse to adapt will fail. And in an even more closely entwined global economy, there will be hundreds, if not thousands, of companies standing in line to take their place.\\" According to one Hebrew aphorism, man plans and then God howls with laughter. No plan can accommodate all possibilities. No plan can guarantee success or failure. Ingebretsen does not offer a failure-proof strategy. Rather, he suggests how the search for one could (perhaps should) be conducted.<br />My own opinion about all this is that the planning process is not only important but imperative. Of even greater importance, the plan (once devised) must preclude violation of \\"The Ten Deadly Sins\\" while ensuring that the given organization has the resilience needed to respond rapidly and effectively to change. Ingebretsen agrees with Charles Darwin that natural selection results in the survival of the fittest...and the fittest are those who are most adaptable. It remains for those who read this brilliant book to make their own determination as to which portions of it can be of most immediate benefit. They are well-advised to keep in mind that decision-makers in their competitor companies will probably read Ingebretsen's book. Also, that Internet time waits for no one. In the final anaylsis, moreover, most fatal wounds are self-inflicted.illiant book to make their own determination as to which portions of it can be of most immediate benefit.

It was based on rigorous research which revealed the key strategic decisions that most often determine growth or stagnation in business. They note: \\"Central to our findings are three ideas: the concept of the core business and its boundaries; the idea that every business has a level of full-potential performance that usually exceeds what the company imagines; and the idea that performance-yield loss occurs at many levels, from strategy to leadership to organizational capabilities to execution.\\" In the five chapters which follow, Zook (with Allen) examines \\"the types of strategic business decisions that most often seem to tilt the odds of future success or failure.\\" Zook correctly suggests in this book that many organizations cannot resist the appeal (\\"the siren's song\\") of \\"miracle cures\\" of their problems. Zook focuses entirely on what has been verified in real-world experience, on what is practical, and on what will reliably achieve the desired results of sound strategic decisions.<br />In the first chapter of this book, Zook discusses what he calls \\"the growth crisis\\" which many (most?) organizations encounter. He observes, \\"Finding or maintaining a source of sustained and profitable growth has become the number one concern of most CEOs. And moves that push out the boundaries of their core business into 'adjacencies' are where they are most often look these days.\\" I agree with Zook that these strategies have three distinctive features: \\"First, they are of significant size, or they can lead to a sequence of related adjacency moves that generate substantial growth. Second. they build on., indeed are bolted on, a strong core business. Thus the adjacent area draws from the strength of the core and at the same time may serve to reinforce or defend that core. Third, adjacency strategies are a journey into the unknown, a true extension of the core, a pushing out of the boundaries, a step-up in risk from typical forms of organic growth.\\" Much of the material in this brilliant book is guided and informed by what Zook claims is \\"the new math of profitable growth.\\" Specifics are best provided by Zook himself.<br />Zook presumes that those who read this book already know what a core business is, and more specifically, what the core business is of their respective organizations. Given his objectives, that assumption is probably necessary so that he can explore the opportunities which (key word) appropriate adjencies offer. Fair enough. However, my own experience suggests that companies frequently extend the boundaries of a core business without fully understanding what that core business is. Railroads probably offer the best example. Only much too late (if then) did senior-level executives at major railroads realize that their core business was transporting people and cargo, NOT \\"railroading.\\" Obviously, trains are confined to the tracks as are ships to the water and trucks to the roadways over which they proceed. Early on, what if owners of railroads and their associates had addressed questions such as those Zook poses in his Preface (Page ix)? Had they done so, presumably they would have recognized appropriate adjacencies which include taxi cabs, Super Shuttle, local delivery services, and \\"overnight\\" delivery services (e.g. DHL, FedEx, and UPS). While they're at it, why not own or forge strategic partnerships with over-the-road trucking companies and cargo airlines? Given the central locations of railroad stations in major metropolitan areas, it would have been easy enough to combine a full-range of travel services within an upscale retail mall.<br />The question to ask, therefore, is not what an organization's core business is. Rather, what could AND SHOULD it be? The correct answer to that question is important, of course, because without a proper core, there can be chaos. Also, the correct answer suggests appropriate adjacencies by which to achieve and then sustain increasingly more profitable growth.<br />In the Afterword, Zook imagines himself engaged in what he calls the proverbial \\"elevator\\" conversation during which he reviews the \\"key messages\\" contained within his book.

In this volume, he correctly insists that responsibility for profitable growth must be shared by everyone involved. He offers \\"Ten Tools\\" by which to achieve that important objective. First, he identifies three barriers to such growth: \\"First, the balance has gone too far in the direction of cost-cutting at the expense of revenue growth...Second, when most managers think about growth, it is in terms of home runs -- the disruptive technology, the new revolutionary business model, the mega-merger -- instead of the singles and doubles that, when executed at a steady pace, cumulatively can increase revenue substantially...Third, improving productivity and increasing revenues are seen as two separate issues, when they are, in fact, inseparable for long-term success. If managers concentrate only on raising productivity, they are only doing half their job.\\" To these I presume to add a fourth barrier which Jim O'Toole discusses in Leading Change: \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" Charan obviously has this barrier in mind when correctly insisting that several mind-sets which endure as received wisdom are, in fact, dead wrong.  <br />With regard to the \\"Ten Tools\\" which Charan recommends, no surprises there. My concern, frankly, is that some readers will cherry-pick a few, try them, and then \\"see what happens.\\" That would be serious mistake. Rather, they should see all ten as separate but interdependent core principles to guide and inform the design and implementation of a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system by which to achieve and then sustain profitable growth. At a time when so many business books are published which offer answers, I especially appreciate Charan's inclusion of several lists of questions which are relevant to orevoked by a specific issue or problem. For example, in the Conclusion (pages 196-198), he poses a series of questions which will help a reader to determine whether or not she or he is now part of a growth business. My own opinion is that these are precisely the same questions which decision-makers in any organization (regardless of size or nature) should frequently ask. Why not dedicate a half-day, select a group of (let's say 10-12 key people), distribute these questions in advance among them, and then meet in executive session to share responses? Then reach consensus on specific action steps to be taken...by whom...with each being assigned a deadline.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out  Jim Collins' Good to Great, Michael Hammer's The Agenda, Paul Niven's Balanced Scorecard Step by Step, and Chris Zook's Beyond the Core.	2004-02-12

Kaplan wrote the Foreword to this book. He and David P. Cohen are the co-authors of three other books on this important subject: The Balanced Scorecard: Translating Strategy into Action, The Balanced Scorecard: Measures That Drive Performance (HBR OnPoint Enhanced Edition), and most recently The Strategy-Focused Organization: How Balanced Scorecard Companies Thrive in the New Business Environment. In the Preface, Kaplan graciously welcomes \\"this new book to the Balanced Scorecard literature\\" and goes on to suggest that \\"Niven's contribution will enable many more organizations to achieve successful Balanced Scorecard implementations.\\"<br />Given the potential benefits of such a program, one which provides a measurement system that balances the historical accuracy and integrity of financial numbers with today's drivers of economic success, I strongly recommend that Kaplan and Norton's books also be consulted. The total cost seems a small price to pay for the substantial value that will be derived.<br />Here is how Niven organizes his material :<br />Part One: Introduction to Performance Measurement and the Balanced Scorecard<br />Its purpose is to \\"familiarize [the reader] with the field of performance measurement and provide a solid grounding of Scorecard background and principles.\\"<br />Part Two: Step-by-Step Development of the Balanced Scorecard<br />Next, Niven provides his reader with \\"a detailed review and description of the elements necessary to construct this new and powerful management tool.\\"<br />Part Three: Embedding the Balanced Scorecard in the Organization's Management System<br />Then Niven shifts his (and his reader's) attention to implementing -- literally step-by-step --  a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system based on the aforementioned principles (Part One) and elements (Part Two). This marks the \\"Scorecard's transition from a measurement system to a strategic management tool.\\" Niven explains in Chapter 8 how to align every employee's actions with the organization's overall goals.<br />Part Four: Sustaining Balanced Scorecard Success<br />Niven carefully examines the importance of frequent reports on results (to date) which both broaden and (more importantly) deepen support of the Scorecard within the organization. To repeat, the Scorecard is an effective management tool as well as a source of measurement information.<br />Part Five:  Balanced Scorecard in the Public and Not-for-Profit Sectors and Concluding Thoughts on Scorecard Success<br />The \\"many advantages conferred by a the Balanced Scorecard\\" were recognized and appreciated almost immediately by public-sector and not-for-profit organizations. This \\"rising trend\\" serves as Niven's focal point in Chapter 13 and then, in the final chapter, he shares some concluding thoughts.<br />These specifics are provided so that those who read this review will have a clearer understanding of the scope of what Niven offers. No brief commentary such as this, however, can adequately suggest the depth of his probing analysis. He wrote the book for decision-makers in organizations which are now deciding whether or not to commit to a Balanced Scorecard program. Also for decision-makers in other organizations within which such a program is now underway. Niven concludes his Preface with Euripides' especially relevant comments on the importance of balance, first expressed almost 2,500 years ago:  \\"The best and safest thing is to keep a balance in your life, acknowledge the great powers around us and in us. If you can do that, you are really a wise man.\\" I wholly agree with Niven that \\"the same applies to organizations.\\"pter 8 how to align every employee's actions with the organization's overall goals.<br />Part Four: Sustaining Balanced Scorecard Success<br />Niven carefully examines the importance of frequent reports on results (to date) which both broaden and (more importantly) deepen support of the Scorecard within the organization.

Whether or not these are, in fact, the dumbest may be subject to debate but they will certainly serve the purposes of Horowitz and the editors of Business 2.0 magazine, assisted by Mark Athitakis and Mark Lasswell. (For my own purposes, I will simply refer to them collectively as the book's co-authors.) Throughout nine chapters, they examine \\"useless products, ruinous deals, clueless bosses, and other signs of unintelligent life in the workplace.\\" The material offers substantial entertainment value (\\"What on earth were they thinking?\\") but also provides several legitimate business lessons which, hopefully, will enable an enlightened reader to avoid making the same mistakes. How were these \\"moments\\" selected? There were three primary criteria: First of all, nobody gets killed...Second, the stories must have a discernible moment of utter fatuity rather than a slowly festering brainlessness...Third, when some form of business buffoonery is particularly chronic, only the choicest example makes the cut.\\" These are obviously not dumb criteria.<br />The titles of the nine chapters correctly indicate how the co-authors organized evidence of \\"unintelligent life in the workplace.\\" It seems eminently appropriate that in Chapter One: Research and Development, they include this familiar observation: \\"Everything that can be invented has been invented.\\" Charles H. Duell, Federal Office of Patents commissioner, 1899. Subsequent chapters examine Human Resources,  Manufacturing and Production, Senior Management, Public Relations, Sales and Marketing, Accounting, Legal, and Information Technology. The usual suspects include New Coke, the Edsel, the Waterworld film, 17th century tulip bulbs, and Charles K. Ponzi. However, there are dozens of other \\"moments\\" of which I was previously unaware.<br />I also appreciate the wealth of quotations, especially when provided by those (such as Mr. Duell) who should have known better. For example, then president and CEO of Digital Equipment Corporation Kenneth Olson at the annual convention of the World Future Society in 1977: \\"There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in their home.\\" Years earlier, Thomas Watson, Sr. (then CEO of IBM) estimated that the worldwide market for personal computers was fewer than ten. Presumably those who headed Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) agreed with Watson and Olson. How else to explain their generous provision of information to Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak which enabled them to complete the design of what became the Apple I computer?<br />As I read this entertaining as well as informative book, I recalled the suggestion (but not the source) that Russian historians can predict the past with absolute accuracy and Theodore Roosevelt's comments about \\"the man in the arena.\\" Also Thomas Edison's response to an assistant's frustration after 90+ \\"failures\\" of a research project. Edison did not view them as failures. Rather, he explained, those efforts had merely indicated how NOT to solve the given problem.<br />For me, at least, the most valuable lessons to be learned are from failures, not successes. Now more than ever before, success in the business world heavily depends upon innovative thinking. Presumably the co-authors agree with me that  \\"useless products, ruinous deals, clueless bosses, and other signs of unintelligent life in the workplace\\" are probably the inevitable price to be paid for achieving that success.ation Kenneth Olson at the annual convention of the World Future Society in 1977: \\"There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in their home.\\" Years earlier, Thomas Watson, Sr. (then CEO of IBM) estimated that the worldwide market for personal computers was fewer than ten.

That is, all who are directly involved walk away with something...or at least think they have. (Back to that point in a moment.) In this volume, Camp asserts that win-win is emotion-based, therefore unreliable and often self-defeating. He claims that the most effective negotiators take a decision-based approach which he explains step-by-step. \\"What is the poison that resides at the heart of the big lie which is win-win? You've heard of the deadly stuff. It's called [in italics] compromise....Why in the world compromise before you are certain you have to? Sometimes you do, and that's fine, but often you don't, and that's better. The key point is that with the win-win mindset, [in italics] you'll never know which it is.\\"<br />Here a brief excerpt from Richard Tedlow's The Watson Dynasty in which he discusses a sales strategy used effectively by Joseph Crane who, when National Cash Register's salespersons encountered arguments and objections for which they were unprepared, recommended this response: \\"Why, that's just the very reason you should have one!\\" Crane was a great salesman from whom Thomas H. Watson Sr. learned a great deal while employed by NCR. In this instance, as Tedlow explains, \\"A prospect has just advanced a reason why he should not buy a register. He encounters [in the response by the NCR salesperson] not hesitation, not argument, not refutation. Rather, he is told that his reason not to buy is actually the reverse of what he thought it was. Once again, the magic lay in putting the salesman on the same side of the customer. Crane put the customer in the position of arguing with himself while agreeing with the salesman.\\" Perhaps Camp agrees with me that the single worst mistake in any negotiation, the single most common mistake, is to argue against yourself.<br />According to Camp, there is a significant difference between perception and reality insofar as a win-win resolution is concerned. That is, if the other party walks away thinking that she or he has \\"won\\" something, fine. However, Camp insists, \\"win-win is often win-lose because it invites unnecessary compromise, because it is [in italics] emotion-based, not [in italics] decision-based, and because it plays to the heart, not to the head.\\" He carefully organizes his material within 14 chapters which introduce, one by one, the principles and practices of his system. In the final chapter, Camp shares what he considers to be \\"Life's Greatest Lesson: The Only Assurance of Long Term Success\\" and then in his Conclusion, he offers 33 \\"rules to remember.&quot;<br />I have previously reviewed several excellent books on the subject of negotiation, each of which (to varying degree) recommends a win-win approach. Obviously, Camp totally disagrees with that approach and explains why. It remains for each reader of this commentary to consider carefully all manner of values, mindsets, strategies, and tactics which these books advocate, then decide for herself or himself which are most appropriate. My own opinion (for whatever it may be worth) is that the decision-based approach is preferable to the emotion-based approach; also that, if at all possible, the resolution of any negotiation serves the best interests of everyone involved.

Thus far, a substantial majority of Six Six programs either failed or fell far short of expectations. Why? Lots of reasons but one of the major ones is dysfunctional teamwork. Hence the special importance of this pocket guide.<br />Although Rath and Strong do indeed provide a wealth of information about Six Sigma, their &quot;pocket guide&quot; can be of substantial value to all organizations (regardless of size or nature) which need to simplify, thereby improve the process by which they produce whatever they offer for sale. Products, of course, but also professional services (e.g. legal, accounting, management consulting), memberships (e.g. healthcare providers as well as trade and professional associations such as chambers of commerce), and charitable support (e.g. non profit, tax exempt 501 (c) 3 organizations such as college and universities). Chapter One introduces the book's core concept, DMAIC, an acronym for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. A chapter is then devoted to each of the five separate but related process components. Rath and Strong explain how this process will guide and inform efforts to increase the ROI of resources to achieve whatever the desired objectives may be.

What we have here in a single volume is a focus on \\"the critical factors that can make or break the implementation of Six Sigma in an organization.\\" The contributors identify, explain, and then support these principles with real-world experiences and examples. \\"By placing Six Sigma in this context, this book will, in fact, be useful for any executive, manager, or employee who wants to understand how Six Sigma can help address the particular challenges of their organization.\\" This book was written with empathy for non-technicians (such as I) as it responds to questions such as these:<br />* What is Six Sigma?<br />* Why Six Sigma?<br />* Why NOT Six Sigma?<br />* Where and how to begin?<br />* Whom to involve in Six Sigma initiatives?<br />* What is senior management's role?<br />* Major cultural barriers and how to overcome them?<br />* How and when to implement Six Sigma program?<br />* How to measure progress?<br />* How to sustain process improvement?<br />My own rather extensive experience suggests that all organizations can improve HOW they conduct business. Some processes may involve development of new products or services, others production and/or distribution, and still others order processing. Whatever. Not all organizations, however, need a full-blown Six Sigma program. In fact, a majority of such programs either fail or fall far short of expectations.<br />Among the many substantial benefits of this book is the guidance it provides to decision-makers when they struggle to determine the nature and extent of process improvement initiatives needed. You don't need a full-blown Six Sigma program inorder to, for example, reduce cycle time while improving first-pass yield. Among the most valuable chapters in this book are the last two. With appropriate modification, the principles, strategies, and tactics in both Chapter 24 (\\"Measuring and Auditing Results\\") and in Chapter 25 (\\"Developing Change Leadership Capacity\\") are relevant to any organization, regardless of size of nature. In my opinion, each of these two chapters (all by itself) is worth far more than the cost of the book but the value of both is even greater, of course, when their material is absorbed and digested at the conclusion of the sequence of chapters.

I also believe, however, that family members should assume primary responsibility for such care rather than abdicating it to institutions and agencies in the public sector. For various reasons, people are living longer now than ever before. When resources and circumstances permit, elderly loved ones continue to live in their own homes or in dedicated facilities which offer assisted-living services. Based on my own experience and the collective experiences of countless friends, I realize that few of us are adequately prepared to address the issues which West-Rodriguez and Dennis discuss in this book. Some involve logistics. Others involve healthcare. For me, the most complicated issues are those relevant to an elderly loved one's pride, self-esteem, and concerns about quality of life. (Those who taken away an elderly loved one's car keys and/or check book know exactly what I am talking about.) In this volume, West-Rodriguez and Dennis offer expert counsel as well as a step-by-step \\"game plan\\" which both anticipates and prepares for all manner of situations in which family members and caregivers can become involved.<br />The book's narrative consists of a series of diary entries by a D.D. (\\"Darling Daughter\\") to which the authors then respond.  After each response, they also offer \\"Our Parting Words to the Wise\\" followed by a \\"Considering Possibilities\\" section, one which allows the reader to complete what amounts to an audit of her or his current thoughts about the issues presented.  Of greatest interest and value to me is the mental preparation which West-Rodriguez and Dennis assist with when truly difficult decisions must eventually be made: When and how to determine a loved ones wishes? How to accommodate those wishes, especially when they seem to be at cross-purposes with health and/or financial concerns? What information needs to be obtained about sensitive matters such as the loved one's finances?<br />I highly recommend this book to family members and caregivers but also to others whose counsel may also be desired when certain important decisions must be made. Attorneys and accountants, for example, as well as insurance agents, clergy, and perhaps financial and/or estate planners. This is a handbook but also a WORKbook. Its ultimate value will be determined by the nature and extent to which those who purchase it and read it then follow the step-by-step process which West-Rodriguez and Dennis recommend.<br />One final point: There is no single source of wisdom, no one book which asks all the right questions and provides all the right answers. West-Rodriguez and Dennis offer a starting point with regard to mental preparation and then some exercises which can help to clarify issues, set priorities, and suggest an appropriate course of action. For that, those who are guided by their counsel -- and their loved ones -- should forever be grateful.sitive matters such as the loved one's finances?<br />I highly recommend this book to family members and caregivers but also to others whose counsel may also be desired when certain important decisions must be made.

In this volume, he focuses his attention on Thomas Watson Sr. and Jr. who established and then developed one of the great dynasties in modern business history. (Watson Sr. was among seven \\"Giants\\" Tedlow discusses in his previous book.) This volume consists of several separate but carefully integrated parts: Watson Sr.'s life and career, his son Tom's life and career, and their often volatile personal as well as professional relationship at IBM.<br /><br />Of special interest to me is Watson Sr.'s career with the National Cash Register company during which he observed first-hand the leadership and management style of its founder and CEO, John Henry Patterson. Tedlow suggests that Watson Sr. learned many lessons from Patterson which later proved invaluable when, after being asked to resign his position at NCR, Watson accepted an offer to head the Computing-Tabulating-Recording company, renamed the International Business Machines Corporation in 1924. By then, Watson had demonstrated his genius as a salesman. \\"It was, however, his very appreciation of selling that prompted his constant push for better products and his support of engineers and the interest risks of research and development....What made Watson great was his understanding that in order for marketing to succeed, the marketers needed a product to sell which the market would accept....Selling was the art of helping the customer to understand that he did indeed both need and want what you were selling to him.\\" Tedlow leaves no doubt that Watson's years at NCR fully prepared him to thrive as CEO of IBM, choosing the right product to bet on, taking full advantage of any and all opportunities to sell it, and -- meanwhile -- building a culture in which ever-increasing sales and profits were driven by technical superiority and a total commitment to serving each customer's needs.<br /><br />Also of interest to me is the relationship between the two Thomas Watsons. Theirs was a love-hate relationship, to be sure. Thomas Watson Sr. ran IBM for 42 years and one week, from May 1, 1914, until May 8, 1956. Throughout that period, father and son frequently had \\"hellacious\\" arguments. According to Watson Jr., their fights were \\"savage, primal, and unstoppable\\" and yet, as Tedlow explains, they deeply loved and greatly respected each other. Following Watson Sr.'s death, he was proclaimed the \\"World's Greatest Salesman\\" in a front-page New York Times headline. Watson Jr. was devastated, so much so that he took several months off to cope with his grief. He then returned to his duties as CEO and proceeded to transform IBM into what was then, by all accounts, the world's best managed corporation.<br /><br />A brief commentary such as this simply cannot do full justice to what Tedlow achieves in this volume. Suffice to say that he draws upon a wealth of historical and biographical information to reveal and explain the full significance of two great corporate leaders, to be sure, but also to reveal and explain them in compelling human terms, warts and all. Eventually, Tedlow observes, IBM encountered in the 1990s, a near-death experience. \\"The problem with IBM was not Watson principles and practices. It was that those principles and practices had ossified. Rather than being living, breathing, flexible guidelines within which creative people could work and be playful at their work, they had degenerated into mere words which had lost their meaning. They were only limiting, never liberating. The shadow [of the Watsons] remained; the substance had disappeared.\\" Thomas J. Watson Jr. died on December 31, 1993. The next CEO, Lou Gerstner, was the first successor to Watson Jr. who would not have him looking over his shoulder. On Gerstner's watch, IBM survived its near-death experience and is now led by Samuel J. Palmisano, an executive who has spent his entire career at IBM. To say that IBM has returned to its roots is to say that IBM has re-established itself in alignment with the principles and practices of two visionary leaders named Watson.To say that IBM has returned to its roots is to say that IBM has re-established itself in alignment with the principles and practices of two visionary leaders named Watson.	2004-01-19

This is a key point. In this volume, he offers 32 practical ways by which to do less inorder to accomplish more. \\"I've designed a book of workarounds and shut-off valves -- ways to get around or stop the senseless stuff that comes at you every day.\\" Presumably Jensen agrees with Stephen Covey that most of us spend too much time on what is urgent and not enough time on what is important. To say this is a \\"handbook\\" is to correctly suggest that it is a WORKbook. All of the material is valuable but not all of it is immediately relevant to a given reader's immediate needs. Hence Jensen's advice: \\"Pick (only) the three or four chapters that scream at you...Follow the steps in each chapter [and then] Rip out the Do-Less Toolkit pages at the back of the book...Tack `em up wherever you'll see them every  day. Be one with the pages. Do less.\\"<br />Jensen organizes his material within three Sections: Daily Rituals, Career Milestones, and Leader Essentials. In each, he provides a series of \\"How tos\\" in combination with appropriate metrics by which to (a) measure the current situation, (b) identify what must be done to improve it, and then (c) measure the progress of improvement initiatives.  For example, the \\"Less-O-Meters\\" track Courage, Difficulty, and Yield. All this is much less complicated than I may now indicate. The greatest difficulty, obviously, is taking appropriate ACTION and staying with Jensen's program. The road to self-improvement is paved with good intentions but, too often, is soon abandoned. Most of those who purchase this handbook do so because they sense a great need in their lives to eliminate what is not essential to it. It is human nature to begin with high hopes and great expectations and then become discouraged or distracted. That phenomenon is quite common and illustrates precisely why this handbook will be of greatest benefit to those who need it most because they are most vulnerable to procrastination.<br />It will also be of substantial benefit to victims of what Jensen characterizes as \\"corporate crap.\\" For example, quite some time ago, editors of a magazine (whose name I have forgotten)  conducted a \\"Dilbert Quotations\\" contest. They were looking for people to submit quotations from their real-life Dilbert-type managers.<br />Here are some of the finalists:<br />1. \\"As of tomorrow, employees will only be able to access the building using individual security cards. Pictures will be taken next Wednesday and employees will receive their cards in two weeks.\\" (This was the winning quotation from Fred Dales at Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, WA.)<br />2. \\"What I need is a list of specific unknown problems we will encounter.\\" (Lykes Lines Shipping)<br />3. \\"E-mail is not to be used to pass on information or data. It should be used only for company business.\\" (Accounting manager, Electric Boat Company)<br />4. &quot;We know that communication is a problem, but the company is not going to discuss it with the employees.&quot; (Switching supervisor, AT&amp;T Long Lines Division)<br />5. One day my Boss asked me to submit a status report to him concerning a project I was working on. I asked him if tomorrow would be soon enough. He said &quot;If I wanted it tomorrow, I would have waited until tomorrow to ask for it!&quot; (New business manager, Hallmark Greeting Cards)<br />I urge you to purchase this handbook and follow Jensen's suggestion that you skim-read it from cover-to-cover. While doing so, you will immediate recognize those portions which are of most immediate relevance to your own circumstances, both at work and in your private life. Focus on those sections initially. Precisely follow the step-by-step process which Jensen recommends. Because you will be embarking on an especially difficult journey, expect to encounter obstacles along the way, experiencing frustration and \\"combat fatigue\\" as you do so. Stay the course! For Dorothy and her valiant companions, there was yellow brick road for them to follow during their journey to the Emerald City. Whatever your own destination may be, Jensen offers this handbook which can become a yellow brick road for you.<br />Bon voyage!levance to your own circumstances, both at work and in your private life.

Ruthless Execution<br />Ignore this book's somewhat overheated title and concentrate on Hartman's core concepts which he develops with meticulous care. He suggests a number of strategies and tactics by which business leaders can respond effectively when they encounter what Hartman calls the \\"rude awakening that occurs when a company has enjoyed  consistently high-level performance, but comes up against some new factor: a downward turn in the economy, a lack of product innovation, growth that occurs too rapidly, a missed market opportunity, or as is most often the case, ineffective execution.\\" Hartman organizes his material within five Parts which consist of a total of 12 individual chapters: Managing Through Tough Times, Leadership: Dealing with Rude Awakenings, How to Play the Game, Breaking Through the Wall, and What It All Means. The focus of Hartman's book is on \\"business reversals and the need to shepherd business leaders through those reversals because, quite frankly, corporations are passing through a new, more complex, more worrying age. The long and short of it is that it's far more difficult to be a successful business leader today than ever before.\\"<br />The statistics support Hartman's last observation. In 2001, for example, 257 public companies (with a total of $258 billion in assets) declared bankruptcy. In 2002, another 67 did so. Go back even further to the 43 companies which Peters and Waterman quite properly praised in In Search of Excellence (1982). Most no longer qualify according to the criteria by which they were selected...and several do not exist at all. Scary? You bet.<br />In Chapter 8, Hartman offers a \\"Ruthless Execution Checklist\\" which can be of substantial value to all organizations, regardless of size or nature:<br />1. Do you have a cost and working capital management program that is driven through the business?<br />[NOTE: For small companies, the more appropriate question is \\"Is there a sound reason for the expenditure of each hour and each dollar?\\"]<br />2. Do you have a proactive and disciplined approach to identifying and assessing potential acquisitions and divestitures?<br />[NOTE: For small companies, the more appropriate question is \\"What should you add to what you now offer? What should you eliminate?\\"]<br />3. Do you regularly assess whether the corporate center is adding distinctive value to each business unit?<br />[NOTE: For small companies, the more appropriate question is \\"Does everything you do add value to each customer relationship?\\"]<br />4. Do you effectively and swiftly manage out non-performers?<br />[NOTE: Extensive research indicates that, on average, each mishire costs 24 times her or his annual salary. Hire slowly but fire FAST.]<br />Most organizations now face serious challenges. Many of those organizations will not survive. For their decision-makers, what to do? To his credit, Hartman does not propose a series of specific (one size fits all) answers to that question. Rather, in the final chapter, he includes a \\"Ruthless Execution Index\\" with instructions as to how to use it. It remains for each reader to provide correct responses to the 54 statements which comprise the \\"Index.\\" Once this exercise has been completed, the far greater challenge -- obviously -- is to take appropriate action. Hartman can assist with that process. I also recommend a careful reading of Bossidy and Charan's Execution, Hammer's The Agenda, Collins' Good to Great, and Kaplan and Norton's The Strategy-Focused Organization.and each dollar?\\"]<br />2.

Also, I have been a fan of Major League Baseball and especially of the Cubs and White Sox since growing up in Chicago. In the years since, wherever I lived, I attended as many MLB games as I could when I wasn't watching them on television. Finally, wholly on the basis of Rose's statistics, I think he deserves to be elected to the MLB Hall of Fame.<br />Until I read the excerpt from his book and then the book itself, I did not know that he had been lying when insisting publicly and constantly that he had never bet on MLB games. His verbal assaults on Commissioners Uberroth, Giamatti, and Vincent as well as John Dowd seemed (to me) to express the outrage of someone reacting to what he viewed as a gross injustice. Then I read the book.<br />With the assistance of Rick Hill, it is well-written. Just as Rose's prior public statements had convinced me of his innocence of betting on MLB games, the book convinced me that I could no longer believe whatever Rose may say about himself, his life, and his career. Perhaps inevitably, his opinions are highly selective, in fact strategic. He seems to see himself as someone special, deeply resentful whenever held accountable for his behavior off the diamond and away from the dugout. (He was a special baseball player, among the greatest ever. No doubt about that.) In the book, Rose reveals a strong sense of entitlement beyond the praise he once earned and now deserves as a professional athlete. As I read this book, my reaction was more of sadness than of outrage. I did not feel betrayed, fooled, duped, etc. Just sad.<br />For 14 years, the media have given Rose an abundance of opportunities to state his case for election to the MLB Hall of Fame and/or reinstatement within MLB. For obvious reasons, he expressed no regret about his verbal abuse of three MLB commissioners and the author of the Dowd Report. Now his book has appeared and is certain to be a bestseller. As with any bestseller, there is extensive media interest in the author (or co-author). So again Rose has the public's eyes and ears as his campaign continues. There has even been a mock trial at the Harvard Law School during which Johnny Cochran achieved a \\"legal victory\\" on Rose's behalf, opposed during the mock trial by Alan Dershowitz. Meanwhile, Commissioner Selig observes all this without response, no doubt trying to determine what an expedient decision would be.<br />Two hunches and they are only hunches: Pete Rose will enjoy a brief period of increased public attention with some entrenched adoration and then his celebrity will fade, as will his credibility. Also, Commissioner Selig will eventually decide to continue the terms and conditions of Commissioner Giamatti's ruling (May 9, 1989). Could be wrong.<br />As indicated, I think this is a well-written book. It is not a confessional per se. Rather, memoirs during which Rose provides an account of his thoughts and feelings about his career and, especially, his life in recent years. For those of us who care about Major League Baseball and/or Pete Rose, the book is well worth reading. The title of his book may prove to be more significant than he now realizes.

(How many among those who have vilified it as \\"heresy\\" have read it?) Brown is a storyteller, not a theologian. Establishing tension and achieving dramatic effect explain his use (abuse?) of historical as well as theological material. With great skill, he introduces and then develops a number of interesting characters within a gripping and cohesive plot, guiding the reader to what proves to be (given the narrative's parameters) a plausible and pleasing conclusion.<br />Set primarily in Paris, the focus is on Robert Langford and Sophie Neveu as they seek the Holy Grail while struggling to solve a series of puzzles. Their solution of one creates several new, even more complicated puzzles. Meanwhile, their lives are in danger. If they do not crack the Da Vinci Code, they will probably die. The 2,000-year old secret which that code protected will also be lost. Tension builds as clues (true and false) accumulate. Stalked by an assassin, Langford and Neveu are about to complete their quest when....<br />This work of fiction has indeed generated a great deal of controversy. In an article written by Antonio Calanni which appeared in Newsweek magazine, several questions are posed and then answered. For example:<br />Q: Did Leonardo include Mary Magdalene in his \\"Last Supper\\"?<br />A: Most art scholars say no. The figure reputed to be Mary Magdalene is actually the beloved disciple John, who is usually depicted young and clean-shaven.<br />Q: Are Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion real organizations?<br />A: Yes, but there is no indication that either is involved in any plot to conceal or reveal secrets of the Holy Grail.<br />Q: What is the Holy Grail?<br />A: The most widely accepted idea is that it was the cup used by Christ at the Last Supper. Others have hypothesized that it was a secret book. In the 12th century a French abbot claimed to possess it; his silver chalice now resides in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.<br />Q: Is there a secret cache of documents that reveal the true history of Christianity?<br />A: No one knows, but scholars are busy analyzing ancient documents found in Egypt in the last century. These texts, known as the Gnostic Gospels, were lost for centuries, and could shed new light on the origins of the church.<br />Q: Did Leonardo hide clues about church secrets in his paintings?<br />A: Art historians doubt it.<br />© 2004 Newsweek, Inc.<br />Meanwhile, this novel continues to be a bestseller.

These challenges include providing health care for those unable to afford it, attracting the best teaching talent to the weakest schools, establishing a \\"universal\\" living wage, and reforming campaign financing. In 2004, the gross domestic product will be approximately $11-trillion. Based on that, a 2% increase would be $220-billion. <br />Immediately I have questions. Has Miller taken in full account that as much as 85% (if not more) of an annual federal budget is already committed by law to programs such as Social Security and Medicare? Even if the Congress and the President were in agreement about the 2% tax increase and dedicated expenditures Miller proposes, would -- indeed could -- they make them? Even then, where would the (no pun intended) proverbial \\"buck\\" stop in terms of ensuring that the increased expenditures achieve the intended objectives? Finally, given the well-established infrastructures of government at the federal, state, and local levels, will an increase (in whatever amount) in a single year be sufficient to solve problems which have developed during the last (let's say) 50 years? <br />No reasonable person can quarrel with Miller's assertion that such problems exist, and, that public officials need to collaborate much more effectively on solving them. I agree with Miller that \\"our two major political parties are organized around ideologies and interest groups that systematically ban the expression of common-sense ideas that blend the best of liberal and conservative thinking.\\" Perhaps there is a consensus in 2004 on what the most serious problems are. Historically, however, there has always been disagreement as to HOW to solve such problems and my guess (only a guess) is that political divisions are wider and deeper now than they have been at least since the 1930sand perhaps since the Civil War.<br />For me, this book's greatest value is best measured in terms of the controversies and conversations it stimulates. Miller does not have all the right answers...and doesn't claim to. No one does. In fact, he doesn't ask all the right questions. However, he offers a series of quite specific proposals and then supports them. If you disagree, as many do, Amazon offers this opportunity to respond and I am grateful for it.	2004-01-15

Why? So what? These were among the questions in my mind as I began to read this book, one which Strogatz may well have written for non-scientists such as I who tend to ask such basic questions. The science of synchrony applies all relevant resources from disciplines such as mathematics, physics and biology to examine and then explain how and why spontaneous order occurs at every level of the cosmos, in the smallest as well as largest measurable forms. Strogatz invites his reader to tag along as he examines diverse phenomena of synchrony such as fireflies that flash in unison by the thousands, human \\"body clocks,\\" Christian Huygens' experiments and discoveries (e.g. in 1665 when his two pendulum clocks began to swing in unison once within a certain distance of each other), and the closing in 2000 of the Millennium footbridge in London after hundreds of pedestrians caused the bridge to sway dangerously as they adjusted their pace to its undulations.<br />As other reviewers have already noted, Strogatz explores synchrony in chaos systems, at the quantum level, in small-world networks as exemplified by the parlor game &quot;six degrees of Kevin Bacon&quot; and in human behavior involving fads, mobs and the herd mentality of stock traders. The author traces how the isolated and often accidental discoveries of researchers are beginning to gel into the science of synchrony, and he illustrates how the laws of mathematics underlie the universe's uncanny capacity for spontaneous order. For non-scientists such as I, authors such as Strogatz and Albert-Laszlo Barabasi (author of Linked) avoid highly technical concepts and nomenclature while examining an abundance of scientific research on the complexity of systems. Some believe that chaos may somehow mysteriously result in what are merely the illusions of structure and order. Strogatz and others assert that, on the contrary, everything really is connected (directly or indirectly) with everything else.<br />Long ago, Voltaire urged us to cherish those who seek the truth but beware of those who find it. With all due respect to pioneer thinkers such as Strogatz, a great deal more scientific research must yet be completed and evaluated. Terms such as spontaneity, synchrony,  and complexity may well be familiar but the nature and extent of their scientific causes and, more importantly, of their interrelationships (indeed of their interdependence) have yet to be fully revealed. Only then can the significance and implications of such realities be explored with appropriate focus, Strogatz suggests, if not fully understood for decades to come.nnected (directly or indirectly) with everything else. <br />Long ago, Voltaire urged us to cherish those who seek the truth but beware of those who find it.

In the absence of currency, trades have been consummated by assigning relative value to items (e.g. livestock, weapons, clothing) or services (e.g. plowing, medical care, harvesting).  Throughout human history, there have been markets in one form or another at which people exchanged or purchased goods of various kinds, usually in a centrally located area such as a crossroads, harborside, village center, or town square. Buyers and sellers (or traders) gravitated to markets where and when there would be the most people. At least to some extent, all that remains true today even with the emergence of cybermarkets. Effective marketing in the 21st century creates or increases demand first by attracting interest. Hence the importance of visibility. It must also provide a convincing argument as to why a given product or service is preferable to other options, including not purchasing anything. Supply and demand often come into play. Pricing is frequently a decisive issue. For centuries, be it in an ancient bazaar or modern market, buying/selling/trading is among the most dynamic of human activities.<br />In this lively as well as informative book, McMillan offers \\"a natural history of markets\\" which helps us to gain a better understanding of how markets work as well as of what they can and can't do. \\"Markets do what they are supposed to do, however, only if they are we structured. Any successful economy has an array of devices and procedures to enable markets to work smoothly. A workable platform has five elements: information flows smoothly; property rights are protected; people can be trusted to live up to their promises; side effects are curtailed; and competition is fostered.\\" I agree with McMillan that, as a result of innovations made by participants, \\"spontaneous evolution is the main driver of [private sector] markets\\" if and when provided with assistance from the public sector (i.e. government).<br />Because throughout history the strength of markets has been their adaptability and their \\"restless reinvention,\\" McMillan argues, shaping new markets is both a task for governments and an opportunity for entrepreneurs. Appropriate involvement by the former ensures, for example, the protection of intellectual property; appropriate involvement by the latter ensures that the process of adaptability and reinvention is sustained. There are so many excellent books now in print which discuss the most effective marketing strategies and tactics.<br />Secondarily, McMillan examines several of them but his primary purpose, as I understand it, is to explain how and why the market economy (\\"...the worst form of economy, except for all the others which have been tried from time to time\\") \\"solves some all but intractable problems...[because] it admits variety and permits criticism\\" This book will be of greatest interest and value to decision-makers with responsibility for marketing within organizations which either have no \\"workable platform\\" or one which may soon collapse from the weight of external competition or internal inadequacy.<br />I also highly recommend this book to those who have a keen interest in cultural anthropology. As suggested earlier, the bazaar or market has always been and always will be among the most dynamic of human activities. Why? Because it must constantly be reinvented to accommodate ever-changing human needs and interests. McMillan's comprehensive analysis of that volatile process is a unique and brilliant achievement.use throughout history the strength of markets has been their adaptability and their \\"restless reinvention,\\" McMillan argues, shaping new markets is both a task for governments and an opportunity for entrepreneurs.

There are so many excellent books now in print which discuss the most effective marketing strategies and tactics. <br />Secondarily, McMillan examines several of them but his primary purpose, as I understand it, is to explain how and why the market economy (\\"...the worst form of economy, except for all the others which have been tried from time to time\\") \\"solves some all but intractable problems...[because] it admits variety and permits criticism\\" This book will be of greatest interest and value to decision-makers with responsibility for marketing within organizations which either have no \\"workable platform\\" or one which may soon collapse from the weight of external competition or internal inadequacy.<br />I also highly recommend this book to those who have a keen interest in cultural anthropology. As suggested earlier, the bazaar or market has always been and always will be among the most dynamic of human activities. Why? Because it must constantly be reinvented to accommodate ever-changing human needs and interests. McMillan's comprehensive analysis of that volatile process is a unique and brilliant achievement.	2004-01-15

Moore explains why and how it is also possible to \\"feed\\" the soul. For me, that is the core concept in his book. He sees this book as a \\"fiction\\" of self-help because \\"no one can tell you how to live your life. No one knows the secrets of the heart sufficiently to tell others all about them authoritatively.\\" Hence Moore's focus on the care of the soul which, if sufficient to the soul's needs, enables us to achieve spiritual health at a time when \\"the mind is separated from body and spirituality is at odds with materialism.\\" In Part IV, he shifts his and his reader's attention to \\"Care of the World's Soul,\\" an obligation which the world's great religions require of those who profess to be devout Muslims, Jews, or Buddhists as well as Christians. This book will not be of substantial value to everyone because many people are unwilling and/or unable to absorb and then digest what may seem to them to be a simplistic invitation: To feed the soul with at least as much care as they now feed their minds and/or their bodies. Nonetheless, I hope at least a few of them allow Moore the full opportunity to share what he offers by reading his book with an open mind.	2004-01-15

How to explain the spectacular success of diverse companies such as Starbucks, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Lexus and BMW, Williams-Sonoma and Bed, Bath & Beyond, Restoration Hardware, Victoria's Secret, Prada, Coach, Panera Bread, and Callaway? Granted, most consumers cannot afford to purchase everything from companies such as these but an astonishing number of consumers are not only willing but eager to pay a premium for at least a few of the products offered.  <br />Why? Silverstein and Fiske offer several reasons. New Luxury merchants never underestimate their customer; they shatter the price-volume demand curve; they create a ladder of genuine benefits (i.e. technical, functional, and emotional benefits); they escalate innovation, elevate quality, and deliver a flawless experience; they extend the price range and positioning of the brand; they customize the customer's value chain to deliver on the benefit ladder; they use influence marketing to \\"seed\\" success through brand apostles (i.e. \\"evangelism\\"); and finally, they continually attack the category like an outsider. What Silverstein and Fiske offer is this volume is a rigorous analysis of those companies which continue to be most successful in the New Luxury economy. They also explain in detail precisely HOW they achieve such success.	2004-01-14

In a brilliant essay which appeared in the Harvard Business Review, Reichheld shares research which suggests that companies with faithful employees, customers, and investors (i.e. capital sources which include banks) share one key attribute: leaders who stick with six \\"bedrock principles\\": preach what you practice, play to win-win, be picky, keep it simple, reward the right results, and finally, listen hard...talk straight. In The Loyalty Effect, Reichheld organizes his material within 11 chapters which range from \\"Loyalty and Value\\" to \\"Getting Started: The Path Toward Zero Defections.\\" With meticulous care, he explains how to devise and them implement programs which will help any organization to earn the loyalty of everyone involved in the enterprise. Reichheld draws upon a wealth of real-world experience which he and his associates have accumulated at Bain & Company, a worldwide strategy consulting firm. Reichheld heads up its Loyalty Practice.<br />In his most recently published book, Practice What You Preach, David Maister explains why there must be no discrepancy whatsoever between the \\"talk\\" we talk and the \\"walk\\" we walk. Reichheld agrees, noting that the \\"key\\" to the success of his own organization \\"has been its loyalty to two principles: first, that our primary mission is to create value for our clients, and second, that our most precious asset is the employees dedicated to making productive contributions to client value creation. Whenever we've been perfectly centered on these two principles, our business has prospered.\\" It is no coincidence that the world's most highly admired companies are also the most profitable within their respective industries. I wholly agree with Reichheld that loyalty is critically important as a measure of value creation and as a source of profit but that it is by no means \\"a cure-all or a magic bullet.\\" Loyalty is based on trust and respect. It must be earned, usually over an extended period of time and yet can be lost or compromised at any time with a single betrayal.<br />In Loyalty Rules!, Reichheld develops these and other ideas (the foundation of what he calls an \\"economic framework\\") in much greater depth as he explains how today's leaders build lasting relationships beyond as well as within their organizations.  \\"Loyalty cannot begin with tools; it must begin with leaders who recognize the enormous value of building and maintaining mutually beneficial relationships....Accordingly, this book spends at least as much time on the underlying objectives for building loyalty as it does on the how-to's.\\" He organizes his material within eight chapters which range from \\"Timeless Principles\\" (previously introduced in The Loyalty Effect) to \\"Preach What You Practice\\" in which he asserts that actions speak louder than words and together, they are \\"unbeatable.\\" One of this book's greatest benefits is provided in a series of \\"Action Checklists\\" which reiterate key ideas while suggesting specific initiatives to implement them effectively. The book concludes with an appendix, \\"The Loyalty Acid Test,\\" which consists of separate surveys of consumers and employees. Obviously, each reader must modify either survey to ensure that it is appropriate to her or his own organization's specific needs and objectives. However, all modifications should be consistent with the 'timeless principles\\" which Reichheld examines in the first chapter. I highly recommend this book, presuming to suggest that, if possible, The Loyalty Effect be read first.ally over an extended period of time and yet can be lost or compromised at any time with a single betrayal.<br />In Loyalty Rules!, Reichheld develops these and other ideas (the foundation of what he calls an \\"economic framework\\") in much greater depth as he explains how today's leaders build lasting relationships beyond as well as within their organizations.  \\"Loyalty cannot begin with tools; it must begin with leaders who recognize the enormous value of building and maintaining mutually beneficial relationships....Accordingly, this book spends at least as much time on the underlying objectives for building loyalty as it does on the how-to's.\\" He organizes his material within eight chapters which range from \\"Timeless Principles\\" (previously introduced in The Loyalty Effect) to \\"Preach What You Practice\\" in which he asserts that actions speak louder than words and together, they are \\"unbeatable.\\" One of this book's greatest benefits is provided in a series of \\"Action Checklists\\" which reiterate key ideas while suggesting specific initiatives to implement them effectively.

How to Use Everyday Ingenuity to Solve Problems Big and Small	Books	5	13	16	N	N	White Caps on Gray Matter	To me, the subtitle of Nalebuff and Ayres's book is especially significant because few of us understand how to use everyday ingenuity to solve problems big and small. So often we ask, \\"What didn't I think of that?\\" I wholly agree with Nalebuff and Ayres that we could have, had we been willing to view a given situation (need, problem, irritation,  etc.) from several different perspectives. For whatever reasons, we seldom do so. That is, we see and hear what we expect because our mental \\"filters\\" perpetuate fixed mindsets.<br />Let's pretend that you have entered the Nalebuff and Ayres Executive Hardware Store.

The central purpose of Nalebuff and Ayres' book is to offer various \\"tools,\\" then explain what each can do and how to use it properly, thereby to change \\"the way people think about their own ability to affect the world. Our goal is to make it natural -- even expected -- for everyone to challenge the status quo and ask, Why not do it this way instead?\\"<br />They cite countless examples from a wealth of real-world experiences, many of which illustrate what I call \\"the invisibility of the obvious.\\" I agree with Nalebuff and Ayres that innovation can be taught. Many of the most innovative consumer products (e.g. Post-Its as well as those derived from Velcro and Gore-Tex) were created by technology and fabrics already available. To ask \\"Why didn't I think of that?\\" is to acknowledge the invisibility of the obvious.<br />Heightening our awareness of potentialities within the so-called commonplace, thereby enabling \\"everyday ingenuity,\\" is precisely why Nalebuff and Ayres wrote this thoughtful, thought-provoking, and eloquent book. It will be of greatest value to decision-makers in literally any organization (regardless of size or nature) who are in urgent need of generating new and better ideas, perhaps re-configuring mature products or services, and generating ideas which will be the seed of entirely new products and services.<br />The quotation from George Bernard Show with which they begin the first chapter seems especially appropriate to the conclusion of my brief commentary: \\"Some men see things as they are and say, `Why?'

Products, of course, but also professional services (e.g. legal, accounting, management consulting), memberships (e.g. healthcare providers as well as trade and professional associations such as chambers of commerce), and charitable support (e.g. non profit, tax exempt 501 (c) 3 organizations such as college and universities). Chapter One introduces the book's core concept, DMAIC, an acronym for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. A chapter is then devoted to each of the five separate but related process components. Rath and Strong explain how this process will guide and inform efforts to increase the ROI of resources to achieve whatever the desired objectives may be. One of this guide's greatest benefits is its ease of use: It can easily be carried within an attach&eacute; case, coat pocket, or purse, always available for direct and immediate access whenever needed. Now more than ever before, decision-makers  are under great pressure to produce more and better results in less time, and with fewer resources. Hence the importance of improving first pass yield and cycle time, for example. Hence the importance, also, of enabling everyone within a given organization to understand how and why her or his efforts can -- and should -- contribute to the organization's operational excellence. For most executives, Rath and Strong offer a concise, easy-to-access, and well-written source of guidance to effectively defining, measuring, analyzing, improving, and controlling various stages of production of ideas as well as products and services.	2003-12-15

At the outset, I presume to share some lessons I have learned over the years which seem relevant to Khalfani's suggestions as to how to \\"conquer 30 costly mistakes and multiply your wealth.\\" First, the importance of systematic savings. Next, the importance of compounded interest on what we save. Finally, the importance of having a realistic plan for increasing one's net worth through systematic savings and the compound interest accumulated by it. Unless and until an individual investor fully appreciates the importance of the first two and then commits to the third,  costly mistakes will be made with inevitable (but avoidable) results.<br />Khalfani organizes her material within five Parts: Strategic Slip-Ups, Buying Blunders, Holding/Monitoring Mishaps, Selling Snafus, and Financial Advisor Foul-Ups. Although each seems to focus on mistakes of judgment, she explains how to avoid the don'ts by doing their opposite. Whereas unsuccessful investors focus on products, successful investors focus on the process of investing. For example, they<br />* Set specific, measurable, and realistic investment goals (Chapter 1)<br />* Do not have concentrated wealth (Chapter 9)<br />* Monitor your investment frequently and rigorously (Chapter 13)<br />* Have a sell strategy (Chapter 17)<br />* Take full advantage of all available independent research (Chapter 25)<br />My guess (only a guess) is that this book will not be of substantial value to sophisticated investors. They and their financial advisors probably know which \\"costly mistakes\\" to avoid and how to avoid them. For so many others, however, I think that Khalfani's book will provide the guidance they need to achieve greater success with their investments than would otherwise be possible. As she explains, the investment process involves five distinct phases: strategizing to identify and then meet personal goals, buying the right (i.e. most appropriate) investments, holding and carefully monitoring those investments, selling investments in a judicious and prudent manner, and dealing effectively with intermediaries such as stockbrokers and financial planners. Basic stuff? Yes, of course, but so many private investors are either unaware of this process or (for whatever reasons) lose patience with it.<br />It remains for each of us to determine what \\"wealth\\" means. More to the point, it is our responsibility, indeed our obligation to protect and preserve whatever resources we may have, investing them wherever and whenever most appropriate. If you are among those in need of expert guidance when making such investment decisions, Khalfani's book can be of substantial assistance. However, as she correctly insists, you must first understand the process...and then invest as much of your time and energy may be required before you make investment decisions.ppropriate) investments, holding and carefully monitoring those investments, selling investments in a judicious and prudent manner, and dealing effectively with intermediaries such as stockbrokers and financial planners.

The city in Michigan will not &quot;end&quot; nor will (in all probability) the so-called Big Three corporations headquartered there (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors) but none resembles what it was 40-50 years ago and each will no doubt undergo significant changes in decades to come. By the way, are there any Small Others?<br />Other reviewers have already noted this book's numerous flaws (e.g. errors of fact, dubious statistics, and typos) and disagree with Maynard about some of her opinions. No need to re-hash them here. My own reaction to her book is that it makes a useful contribution to our understanding of why the United States has lost its dominance in the the automotive industry. There are several reasons, many of which also explain foreign dominance in the consumer electronics industry. Of greatest interest to me are decisions and (yes) non-decisions by the Big Three's senior-level executives which aided and abetted the success of their German and Japanese competitors.<br />I was surprised to learn that foreign-owned companies have built 17 plants in the United States and employ 85,000 people to produce cars and trucks many of us assume to be \\"imports.\\" The same vehicles consistently rank highest in terms of quality of construction and customer satisfaction, lowest in terms of frequency of repair. They are also among the most fuel efficient. So much for the highly-promoted campaign to \\"Buy American.\\" Moreover, Honda and Toyota have an enormous head start in designing and producing hybrid and fuel-cell cars. The Big Three may not be dead and may never die but they certainly have serious problems which could well become worse. What about the Big Three's strategy to offer rebates and deep discounts? Their short-term benefits (other than to the consumer) may result in a spike in sales but almost wipe out dealers' margins and OEM's profits while creating bloated inventories of used vehicles.<br />My wife drives a Honda Accord and I a Nissan Altima. Although the purchase price of each was somewhat more than that of its US counterparts, our extensive research indicated that the total cost of both would be substantially less and that has proven to be true. Reliability is very important. Other than routine maintenance, our Honda and Altima have been care-free. We expect them to have a higher value than their counterparts would when we replace them.<br />Despite its deficiencies, Maynard's book addresses several important issues which have great significance and profound implications. The lessons to be learned from the Big Three's blunders during the past 20-25 years are directly relevant to all other US companies as they now struggle to compete profitably in the global marketplace.My wife drives a Honda Accord and I a Nissan Altima.

Whereas Smith and Emshwiller explored the same company as investigative reporters, McLean and Elkind seem (to me) to have approached their subject as corporate anthropologists. Both books reach many of the same (albeit somewhat tentative) conclusions as to what happened...and why.<br />Two significant differences are that Smith and Emshwiller limit their attention primarily to a period in 2001 extending from October 16th (when Enron announced huge losses caused by two partnerships) to December 2nd (when Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy); McLean and Elkind cover a two-year period of the company's \\"amazing rise and scandalous fall.\\" Also, McLean and Elkind devote far more attention to each of the \\"smartest guys\\"; Smith and Emshwiller seem less interested in them, except in terms of the impact of their mismanagement and corruption. Let's say there are two books about the collapse of the twin towers at the World Trade Center; one focuses on the human tragedies associated with it whereas a second book addresses design, construction, and structural issues. Obviously, both approaches are valid.<br />In certain respects, this book reminds me of Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward's All the President's Men. In both, the reader is provided with a rigorous and comprehensive examination of the process by which investigative journalists generate, evaluate, and pursue leads, then tell a \\"story\\" based on the material they have accumulated. Smith and Emshwiller are the focal points in this book. Their reader feels as if she or he accompanies them each step of the way (at least I did) as they methodically probe ever more deeply into Enron's immensely complicated corporate infrastructure. As already suggested, their focus is less on the personalities of the deal makers than on the deals they made; also on how and why they were able to conceal various illegalities and improprieties long before December 3rd, 2001, when Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.<br />For me, one of the most interesting subjects which Smith and Emshwiller discuss is Arthur Andersen's association with Enron to which they devote several chapters. Given the nature and extent of Enron's financial implosion, what role did its longtime auditor play? And what about other reputable firms such as Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Merrill Lynch which were also centrally involved with Enron's senior managers as they methodically and relentlessly constructed what has since been called \\"a house of cards\\"? Smith and Emshwiller could not have possibly provided definitive answers to questions such as these when their book went to press. Perhaps those answers will not be fully revealed for years to come.<br />I am grateful for the opportunity to learn what I did from this book.

Although both books examine portions of World War Two in the Pacific, each focusing on specific individuals (i.e. the six Marines who raised the American flag on Mount Surabachi and the eight \\"Chichi Jima Flyboys\\"), Bradley's two books examine quite different situations and raise quite different issues. His father (John Bradley) was among the six who raised the flag so presumably young James knew quite a bit about the conquest of Iwo Jima, defended by 22,000 Japanese soldiers. Only decades later did Bradley learn (from recently declassified material) that an even greater number (about 25,000) defended Chichi Jima only 150 miles nearby. The same material also revealed the fates of eight Flyboys who had been captured by the defenders of Chichi Jima. In this volume, Bradley tells their story, one which is \\"a story of war, so it is a story of death. But it is not a story of defeat.\\"<br />To a significant extent, the best military historians demonstrate the skills of cultural anthropologists as they create a context or frame-of-reference within which to present their accounts of combat and of those engaged in it. For example, Bradley explains why Chichi Jima had even greater strategic importance than did Iwo Jima in 1944. Of even greater interest to me is the macro perspective he provides on the Japanese military mentality which viewed surrender as an act cowardice. To understand the \\"why\\" of what happened on Chichi Jima in 1944, Bradley invites his reader to accompany him on a \\"journey\\" back in time, \\"back 149 years...to another another century. Back to when the first American military men walked in No Man's Land.\\" Much of what Bradley then shares is comparable with events and insights revealed by James Clavell in his novel Shogun. Barbarity is often in the eyes of the beholder.<br />While most of the heroes in Bradley's book are Flyboys and most of the villains are Japanese officers, it would be simplistic to accept that as a definitive explanation of the \\"why,\\" the ultimate destination of the aforementioned \\"journey.\\" However brutal and barbaric decapitations and cannibalism may be, are they any more or less so than systematic incineration of urban areas and all who reside there? War is indeed \\"a story of death.\\" Nonetheless, I felt revulsion in response to the behavior of the senior officers on Chichi Jima. Those who survived were tried and convicted of crimes against humanity, then executed...and should have been.<br />With mixed results, Bradley juxtaposes his macro view of quite different cultures with a close examination of those involved in events occurring in No Man's Land. The narrative is less cohesive than in Flags of Our Fathers, probably because Bradley attempts to cover more, and much more complicated human experiences. Thanks to him and his extensive research, we now know exactly what happened to the eight airmen on Chichi Jima.

Most members of SNL's cast and crew seem to have had a love-hate relationship with Michaels but their comments about him (both positive and negative) suggest that no one else could have guided the program as well as he has throughout the years since it first appeared.<br />The material provides (albeit subjective) answers to questions such as these:<br />1.  Which hosts were the most enjoyable to work with? Why?<br />2.  Which were the most unpleasant? Why?<br />3.  What was a normal week's work schedule? Who was involved in each stage of preparation for the next show?<br />4.  Off-camera, what was it like to associate with John Belushi?<br />5.  Of all the cast performers, why was Gilda Radner most loved?<br />6.  How did Michaels deal with the NBC \\"suits\\" and especially with censors?<br />7.  What were the biggest foul-ups prior to or during a show?<br />8. What do most of the cast and crew members agree are the show's greatest moments? Why?<br />9.  What has been the best and worst aspects of being involved with SNL?<br />10. What is the consensus of opinion as to why SNL has continued for almost 30 years?<br />Of special interest to me are the professional as well as personal relationships between and among cast and crew members, including Michaels. More specifically, as I read this book, I was curious to know what impact those relationships had on the programs telecast each Saturday night. Radner, Belushi, and Phil Hartman were three of my personal favorites. Although they made no direct contributions to the reminiscences and observations assembled in this volume, all three are quoted extensively and recalled fondly by those who were closely associated with them.<br />Eddie Murphy offers a representative example of young people with immense but unrefined talent who are finally given the opportunity to perform. (During the 1980-81 season, one show ran short and needed several minutes of \\"filler\\" which he eagerly provided.) Almost immediately Murphy became the most popular member of the SNL cast and was featured prominently until 1984 when he began to concentrate on feature films. For reasons best revealed in this book, Murphy is probably the only SNL \\"star\\"  who has since totally disassociated himself from the program.<br />Who will most enjoy reading this book? Those who have been regular viewers of SNL throughout much if not all of its remarkable history. I also highly recommend it to those who are especially interested in popular culture in the United States from 1975 until the end of the 20th century. I can think of no other television program which offers more and better insights into the culture of that period than does SNL. To their substantial credit, Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller allow the contributors to speak for themselves. Predictably and understandably, the value of what they have to say is determined almost entirely by each reader's degree of interest in those who have proclaimed, week after week, \\"Live from New York!

Eisenhower that I have as yet read. Its title and subtitle correctly indicate what it is...and isn't: John Eisenhower's focus is on his father's military career (especially during the 1940s) during which he was affectionately viewed as \\"Ike\\" by almost everyone with whom he was associated; the material consists of a respectful and loving son's own reminiscences. However, John Eisenhower makes no claim for himself as a biographer or military historian. He limits himself to his own personal experiences with his father when not citing his (i.e. his father's) documented statements and others' eyewitness accounts. The net result is a unique and revealing examination of one of the most important leaders in the 20th century, offered from the perspective of a son who observed General Eisenhower while engaged in his most memorable relationships with other leaders during World War Two, notably with Churchill, Marshall, Patton, Montgomery, and De Gaulle. We also learn much of interest about Ike's relationships with Conner, Pershing, and MacArthur which -- to varying degrees -- also significantly influenced his military career as well as personal development.<br />\\"By no stretch of the imagination is this book a comprehensive biography of Ike, nor is it even a history of the battles he fought. Instead, my essays deal almost exclusively with Ike's relations with his associates, for the simple reason that the facets of his personality appear differently depending on the individual he was dealing with at a given time.\\" John Eisenhower goes on to explain that he offers \\"a son's view of a great military leader -- highly intelligent, forceful, kind, yet as human as the rest of us.\\" What I especially appreciate in this personal account is the fact that the son subordinates himself while recalling the situations while accompanying his father; also, that his views of Ike throughout the book seem balanced as he comments on his father's less attractive qualities (e.g. a sometimes volcanic temper) as well as his most admirable strengths (e.g. forging consensus and cooperation among egocentrics such as Montgomery and De Gaulle). Almost everyone liked Ike. Over time, he also earned the respect which Marshall clearly had for Ike when promoting him over dozens of senior officers to serve as commander of Overlord Operation, arguably the most extensive and complicated military invasion ever undertaken, before or since.<br />Later, Marshall told Ike: \\"You have commanded with outstanding success the most powerful military force that has ever been assembled. You have made history, great history for the good of all mankind and you have stood for all we hope for and admire in an officer of the United States Army.\\" Such praise was well-deserved and widely shared.

Business Excellence in a Disruptive Age	Books	3	8	12	N	N	Sometimes Dazzling But Seldom Substantial	In recent years, Peters has become a passionate provocateur among business writers, heavily relying on flamboyant punctuation to EXPRESS HIS IDEAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sometimes his confrontational approach is effective, sometimes not. As an admirer of the writing styles of Thoreau, Emerson, Orwell, and E.B. White, I am uncomfortable with Peters' writing style but perhaps that's his intent: to stimulate his reader to challenge what Jim O'Toole calls \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" In this volume, Peters explores a wide range of subjects and addresses a number of issues which are certainly worthy of careful consideration. For example, the ever-increasing purchasing power of women, the deficiencies of public school education, the as-yet unfulfilled potentialities of e-business, the often decisive impact of effective branding, and the ever-increasing importance of innovative thinking throughout all levels of any organization. He organizes his material within a volume which is visually unorthodox. Some may be turned off by that. I am not. The page layouts and graphics seem compatible with Peters' apparent objective to challenge, stimulate, etc. My distaste for Peters's writing style aside, I found this volume often lacking in terms of cohesion and transition of key concepts. There is no shortage of ideas but many (too many) are underdeveloped. Some of his opinions about the significance of 9/11 seem insensitive to the human tragedies caused by the events on that day. Two final points: If a book provides at least a few insights which are valuable to my own labors in the vineyards of free enterprise, it is (for me) worth reading. Peters's most recent book does. However, I would have preferred more substance and less style. One man's opinion.	2003-11-18

Of special interest to me was what Womack and Jones had to say in the preface regarding what has since happened to the companies previously discussed. Apparently lean thinking has enabled Toyota, Wiremold, Porsche, Lantech, and Pratt &amp; Whitney to sustain operational excellence and economic prosperity.<br />Briefly, how do Womack and Jones define lean thinking? It is the opposite of muda (a Japanese) word for anything which consumes resources without creating value. In a word, waste. Lean thinking is lean because \\"it provides a way to do more and more with less and less -- less human effort, less equipment, less time, and less space -- while coming closer and closer to providing customers with exactly what they want.\\" Lean thinking is thus a process of thought, not an expedient response or a stop-gap solution. The challenge, according to Womack and Jones, is to convert muda into real, quantifiable value and the process to achieve that worthy objective requires everyone within an organization (regardless of size or nature) to be actively involved in that process. Once again, in this new edition they address questions such as these:<br />1. How can certain \\"simple, actionable principles\\" enable any business to create lasting value during any business conditions?<br />2. How can these principles be applied most effectively in real businesses, regardless of size or nature?<br />3. How can a relentless focus on the value stream for every product create \\"a true lean enterprise that optimizes the value created for the customer while minimizing time, cost, and errors\\"?<br />In Part IV, Womack and Jones update the continuing advance of of lean thinking. They rack the trend in inventory turns and the progress of their profiled companies. Also of special interest to me was the discussion of what Womack and Jones have learned since 1996 which probably explains why they introduce a new range of implementation tools support value stream mapping initiatives and thereby \\"to raise consciousness about value and its components, leading to action.\\"<br />Obviously, even if everyone involved within a given organization is committed to lean thinking, to creating value while (and by) eliminating waste, the process requires specific strategies and tactics to succeed. Hence the importance of the last chapter in this book., \\"Institutionalizing the Revolution.\\" I presume to suggest that the process of lean thinking never ends. Inevitably, success creates abundance;  abundance often permits waste. I also presume to suggest that priorities must first be set so that the implementation of lean thinking process does not inadvertently create or neglect waste in areas which influence the creation of value for customers.<br />Although highly readable, this is not an \\"easy read\\" because it requires rigorous thinking about what is most important to a given organization, rigorous thinking about the root causes (rather than the symptoms) of that organization's problems, and rigorous thinking about the most prudent use of resources to eliminate those problems. Because of the importance of the material which Womack and Jones share, I strongly recommend that decision-makers read and then re-read this book before getting together to exchange reactions to it. Out of that discussion, I hope, will come both a collective commitment to lean thinking and the personal determination of each executive to apply what she or he has learned from this book in operational areas where waste has most diminished value.ementation tools support value stream mapping initiatives and thereby \\"to raise consciousness about value and its components, leading to action.\\"<br />Obviously, even if everyone involved within a given organization is committed to lean thinking, to creating value while (and by) eliminating waste, the process requires specific strategies and tactics to succeed.

He is an internationally renowned expert on negotiation. You express an interest. He invites you to follow him into the attic of his home where he begins to remove from a chest all manner of papers. They are only casually organized. He is intimately familiar with each document. And each document inspires Uncle Herb to share an anecdote, aphorism, or even a complete story. \\"Everybody tells me I should write a book about all this!\\" Well, he has. This is it. What it lacks in cohesion it more than makes up for with fascinating experiences which Cohen has accumulated over many years.<br />He organizes (if that's the word) his material within twelve chapters which range from \\"The Joy of Detached Involvement\\" to my personal favorite, \\"The Game of Life.\\" His advice is eminently practical. At the end of each chapter, he provides a cluster of what he calls \\"Prominent Points.\\" Here are a few:<br />\\"Always view yourself as a problem solver, searching for creative alternatives that can satisfy both sides' real concerns and interests.\\" (Chapter I)<br />\\"Concessions are not appreciated unless effort is expended to obtain them.\\" (Chapter V)<br />\\"As the deadline approaches, remain confident and composed. Fretting and fussing is like a rocking chair: It gives you something to do but gets you nowhere.\\" (Chapter VII)<br />\\"What matters is not what power you've got, but what the other side thinks you've got.\\" (Chapter IX)<br />With all due respect to the \\"Prominent Points,\\" if you are looking for a comprehensive manual on negotiation -- filled with check lists, detailed case studies, etc. -- this isn't it. So what is it? As I attempted to suggest earlier, Cohen's style is informal, conversational really. He shares a wealth of information about his career and discusses several important lessons that he learned about human nature. The subtitle suggests the importance of caring about the given issues but not T-H-A-T much. So really, Cohen spends most of his time on the psychology of negotiation rather than on its mechanics. One clue to his attitude is revealed by the last of the \\"Prominent Points\\" at the end of the last chapter: \\"With all due respect, learning negotiation solely by reading a book is like making love vial e-mail. Thus, get out there and dare to begin.\\"st of his time on the psychology of negotiation rather than on its mechanics.

This book will be especially valuable to those who have a keen interest in \\"the amazing rise and scandalous fall of Enron.\\" I also commend to their attention Smith and Emshwiller's 24 Hours: How Two Wall Street Journal Reporters Uncovered the Lies that Destroyed Faith in Corporate America. The \\"smartest guys in the room\\" included Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey Skilling, Rebecca Mark, Andrew Fastow, Kenneth Rice, and Clifford Baxter. Whereas Smith and Emshwiller explored the same company as investigative reporters, McLean and Elkind seem (to me) to have approached their subject as corporate anthropologists. Both books reach many of the same conclusions as to what happened...and why.<br /><br />Two significant differences are that Smith and Emshwiller limit their attention primarily to a period in 2001 extending from October 16th (when Enron announced huge losses caused by two partnerships) to December 3rd (when Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy); McLean and Elkind cover a two-year period of the company's \\"amazing rise and scandalous fall.\\" Also, McLean and Elkind devote far more attention to each of the \\"smartest guys\\"; Smith and Emshwiller seem far less interested in them, except in terms of the impact of their mismanagement and corruption. Let's say there are two books about the collapse of the twin towers at the World Trade Center; one focuses on the human tragedies associated with it whereas a second book addresses design, construction, and structural issues. Obviously, both approaches are valid.<br /><br />McLean and Elkind suggest that the eventual collapse of Enron was caused less by the greed of senior-level Enron executives than it was by their arrogance and incompetence. Their lack of basic business acumen is astonishing as is their defiance of regulatory agencies and contempt for customers. None of them seems to have had a moral \\"compass.\\" They exemplified, indeed nourished a culture of brutal competition between and among their subordinates. Each used Enron as a personal ATM as well as a means by which to structure all manner of corporate partnerships and high risk/high yield investments without fear of any personal liability. If one prospered, so did they. If it failed, the loss was Enron's. On to another.<br /><br />Primary blame for all this must be shared by Lay, Skilling, and Fastow. McLean and Elkind rigorously examine the inadequacies of each, suggesting that if only one of the three had not been involved, it is probable that Enron would not have had the problems it did. Attorneys, accountants, brokers (notably Merrill Lynch) and bankers (especially Citibank and JP Morgan Chase) apparently were aware of Enron's bending and then breaking of various laws but were earning so much in fees that they chose to remain at the Enron \\"trough\\" side-by-side with Lay, Skilling, Fastow, and other Enron executives.<br /><br />Consider this brief excerpt from Chapter 10 (page 149):<br /><br />Here's how another former employee explains the process: \\"Say you have a dog, but you need to create a duck on the financial statements. Fortunately there are specific accounting rules for what constitutes a duck: yellow feet, white covering, orange beak. So you take the dog and paint its feet yellow and its fur white and you paste an orange plastic beak on its nose, and then you say to your accountants, `This is a duck! Don't you agree that it's a duck?' And the accountants say, `Yes, according to the rules, this is a duck.' Everybody knows that it's a dog, not a duck, but that doesn't matter, because you've met the rules for calling it a duck.\\"<br /><br />There are so many other brief, equally revealing excerpts which I am tempted to include but won't. Earlier, I suggested that McLean and Elkind display in this volume many of the skills of a corporate anthropologist. I also commend them on their skills as storytellers. Of course, it helps to have many colorful characters and such an interesting narrative. Among business books, this is one ofthe rare \\"page turners.\\" If Enron remains a classic example of organizational dysfunction, my guess is that this book will remain the definitive analysis of the causes and effects of that dysfunction.the rare \\"page turners.\\" If Enron remains a classic example of organizational dysfunction, my guess is that this book will remain the definitive analysis of the causes and effects of that dysfunction.	2003-11-03

That is as true in business as it is in healthcare, athletic competition, and international travel. What we have here is a solid, well-organized, and well-written guide to preventing strategic gridlock. First, Harper carefully examines seven of the usual suspects which can cause it. Next, she introduces what she calls U.N.L.O.C.K., a system based on six principles by which to avoid or eliminate them. Finally, she shifts her reader's attention to countless real-world examples.<br />Obviously, an inappropriate strategy almost invariably results in conflict, confusion, acrimony, perhaps operational gridlock, and worse yet, chaos. Moreover, Harper fully understands that even a fundamentally sound strategy can fail because of internal resistance by those whom Jim O'Toole describes as being captive to \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" Or that strategy can become less effective or even ineffective because of market forces over which the organization has little (if any) conrol. Harper has absolutely no illusions about the complexity of these and other issues. She could easily have identified 14 or even 21 \\"roadblocks.\\" Her U.N.L.O.C.K. system could have been based on 10 or even 15 principles. That's not the point. Rather, when crafting a strategy, decision-makers in any organization (regardless of size or nature) should identify and then prepare for what they perceive to be the potentially most formidable roadblocks to that strategy's success. (FYI, my personal preference is to view strategies as \\"hammers\\" and tactics as \\"nails.\\") Everyone must understand and support the strategy. What amounts to an \\"early warning system\\" is needed and everyone at least directly involved with the strategy and its tactics must be especially alert during the strategy's initial implementation.<br />Although I encountered no \\"cutting edge thinking\\" in Harper's book, I hold it in high regard because it fully serves the needs of decision-makers who need (perhaps urgently) a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system by which to avoid or extricate their organizations from strategic gridlock. Another major benefit of having an \\"early warning system\\" is that if the strategy is a dud, that will soon be obvious and Harper's book can assist with whatever adjustments may be necessary.<br />Those who share my interest in how and why even major corporations such as Ford, Coca-Cola, and McDonald's make bad strategic decisions, I urge them to check out Matt Haig's recently published Bad Brands.it in high regard because it fully serves the needs of decision-makers who need (perhaps urgently) a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system by which to avoid or extricate their organizations from strategic gridlock.

What we have here in this especially interesting as well as informative book is Haig's version of \\"the truth about the 100 biggest branding mistakes of all time.\\" With this subtitle, Haig immediately sets himself up for lively disagreement concerning (a) the reasons for why certain brands fail and (b) his selection of the failures themselves. I value this book so highly because Haig (by assertion or implication) challenges his reader to examine her or his own current problems with branding. Frankly, his explanation of brand failure makes sense to me and all of the 100 failed brands he discusses serve seem worthy of examination. He identifies what he calls \\"the seven deadly sins of branding\\": amnesia, ego, megalomania, deception, fatigue, paranoia, and irrelevance. One or more is evident in each of the 100 brand failures on which he focuses.<br />Haig carefully organizes his material within ten chapters. It is easy enough for those who read this brief commentary to check out the Contents so I see no need to provide it. (Thanks Amazon!) He provides a \\"Lessons from....\\" section at the conclusion of most extended analyses. All of the usual suspects are discussed: New Coke, the Ford Edsel, Sony Betamax, McDonald's Arch DeLuxe, Campbell Soup (souper combo), Harley Davidson (perfume), Ben Gay (aspirin), Colgate (kitchen entrees). Pond's (toothpaste) in consumer products; as for dot.coms, Pets.com, VoicePod, and Excite@home. He even examines a number of PR fiascoes.<br />I take at least three lessons from Haig's book. First, even the largest organizations with the greatest resources (including some of the brightest people) can make bad brand decisions and sometimes repeat them with another failed attempt. Although they may be able to absorb or overcome such brand failure, almost all small organizations cannot. Second, that most brand failures result from launching a new product which encounters insufficient demand or marketing a current product for which demand is declining. Hence the importance of market research and especially of asking the customer. Ford did almost no research before introducing the Edsel nor did Coca-Cola before launching New Coke. Both line extensions were disasters. The overwhelming feedback from children surveyed indicated that they did not want Barbie's Ken to wear an earring but Mattel inserted one anyway. The third lesson is that the key to a brand's success (be it a product or service) is it authenticity. (You may prefer the word credibility.) Notice how intensively-hyped films may do well at the box office the first weekend but if they are duds, their sales tumble the following weekend and they are inevitably off the Top Ten list within a month or so, if not sooner. People are willing to try something new if they trust the provider. Lose that trust and there may never be an opportunity to re-earn it.<br />This is a lively, well-written, thought-provoking book. As I suggested earlier, its greatest value to each reader will be determined by what she or he has learned from Haig, and then, how much of that can be applied expeditiously and (more to the point) effectively..

Clever title. Also, Ryan and his contributors really do reveal various techniques that will help anyone to \\"write with ease and get ahead.\\" However, I think it would be a serious mistake to determine the value this book wholly on the basis of its relevance to career success. It offers more, far more than that. Ryan carefully organizes his material within three parts. In the first, he explains what he calls the \\"Plan Then Write Method\\"; next, he provides a series of interviews with ten successful business authors; finally, he provides a series of \\"views\\" from corporate executives. The \\"Plan Then Write Method\\" is explained step-by-step. Think of Ryan as a personal tutor who helps his reader to understand the importance of Subject, Audience, and Purpose. Basis stuff, yes, but presented with a crisp style and in sharp focus. (Would we expect less from an expert on effective writing?) He has chosen his collaborators well. More to the point, with uncommon skill, he elicits from them their most valuable advice concerning so-called \\"secrets\\" to effective writing. All agree with Ryan that the ultimate objective is successful communication.<br />Time Out. Within the classical tradition, there are four levels of discourse: Exposition which uses information to explain, reveal, \\"expose,\\" etc.; Description which makes vivid with compelling details; Narration which tells a story with a plot or explains a process or sequence; and Argumentation which convinces with logic and/or evidence. The best writers of both fiction and non-fiction operate effectively on all four levels.<br />Here are a few brief excerpts from various interviews:<br />\\"The first thing I ask myself is: What do I want to focus on, what do I want to teach? I always try to break my subject into three or four main points, the most teachable concepts, because I don't think people can grasp more than that. The second question I ask is: How do I want to teach it? Do I want to write it like a regular book, a parable, a quotation book?\\" Ken Blanchard<br />\\"The act of writing is the process of clarifying thought. Not just for the reader, but for the writer....There needs to be momentum, and you have to create that; you have to set up the questions at the beginning. That's actually one of the fun things to think about, How am I going to get the reader to turn the page? Now we're on quest together!\\" Marcus Buckingham<br />\\"There are three steps to writing well in my opinion., regardless of what you are writing. Step one: how to end. Step two: where to begin. Step three: what to leave out. Also, I only write one draft that I keep changing until I don't believe it needs to be changed anymore. When I'm finished, there may not be a word left of what I originally wrote down.\\" Roy Williams<br />Later in the interview, Williams shares what I consider to be especially valuable observations about effective writing:<br />\\"The most valuable tip that I can give anybody is: If you want to be a brilliant writer, truly a brilliant writer, then you need to read books of poetry. Poets are the most confident group of writers I know. Let me explain. The simple truth is that a poet is the only writer whose goal is to persuade and cause you to see things with different eyes, and to communicate that new perspective in a very brief, tight economy of words. Poets use unusual combinations of words in a very unpredictable way. Poets have the freedom to put together sentences and utterly break the rules of communication.\\"<br />As I have attempted to indicate in this brief commentary, Ryan's book is really less about using effective writing to advance one's career (i.e. to climb the corporate ladder) than it is about effective thinking which is communicated through effective writing to achieve whatever results the writer may seek. All of the techniques which Ryan and his collaborators so carefully examine are but means by which to achieve that ultimate objective.<br />One final point: Ultimately, the effectiveness of communication with others depends almost entirely on how honestly one first communicates with one's self. In this context, I am reminded of Polonius' advice to son Laertes:<br />\\"This above all: To thine own self be true,<br />And it must follow as the night the day,<br />Thou canst not then be false to any man.\\"eness of communication with others depends almost entirely on how honestly one first communicates with one's self.

Each offers authoritative answers to the most important questions concerning its specific subject. The material in this book is drawn from a variety of sources which include the Harvard Business School Press and the Harvard Business Review as well as Harvard ManageMentor®, an online service. Each volume is indeed \\"a highly practical resource for readers with all levels of experience.\\" And each is by intent and in execution solution-oriented.  Although I think those who have only recently embarked on a business career will derive the greatest benefit, the material is well-worth a periodic review from by senior-level executives.<br />Richard Luecke assembles in this book (and in all of the issues in the series) cutting edge thinking. In this volume, he was assisted by a subject adviser, Professor Mary Munter of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, and they organize the material within nine chapters. Here are their titles:<br />1. Good Writing (It Begins with Principles)<br />2. Start-Up Strategies (Your Launch Point)<br />3. The First Draft (Getting It Down)<br />4. Getting It Right ((The Editing Craft)<br />5. Everyday Writing (Memos, Letters, and E-Mails)<br />6. Presentations (Timeless Principles)<br />7. Backstage (Preparing Your Presentation8. Show Time (Making an Effective Delivery)<br />9. Dialogue (The Ultimate Communication)<br />If you need assistance with mastering essentials in only one of these areas, I urge you to purchase a copy of this book ASAP. Luecke is an uncommonly clear thinker and writer. Thoughtfully, he provides a \\"Summing Up\\" section at the end of each chapter to facilitate a review of key points. There are two other books which I also presume to recommend highly: Kevin Ryan's recently published Write Up the Corporate Ladder and William K. Zinnser's On Writing, 25th Anniversary: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction.	2003-10-17

In fact, I hold it in higher regard now than I did before because Blanchard and Johnson focus on certain core principles which (if anything) are more relevant today than ever before. Specifically, they offer an allegory in which they use the metaphor of a single minute to suggest how to set goals, praise achievers, and reprimand non-achievers within a brief period of time. It is probably human nature to over-explain. (How often have you asked someone for the correct time and received an explanation of how a watch works?) I agree with Blanchard and Johnson that much of our precious time is wasted during interaction which is out of focus. We waste others' time. They waste ours. Group meetings are unproductive. One-on-one conversations fail to achieve their desired objectives. We also waste time when thinking about what we do and how we do it, about what others do and how they do it, and about unsatisfactory results when working with others.<br />Blanchard and Johnson draw heavily upon their extensive research in medicine and the behavioral sciences. What they share in this book is organized within 16 brief chapters. In the first, they introduce a \\"bright young man\\" who is searching for an effective manager from whom he can learn how to become one himself. In the last, the young man (who by then had become a One Minute Manager) is about to share with a young women the same \\"gift\\" which he had previously received from others. \\"I will make only one request of you.\\" Blanchard and Johnson make the same request of those who read this book.<br />For whom will The One Minute Manager be most valuable? Good question. My initial response is to recommend it to those who want to increase their organization's productivity and profits as well as their own prosperity. In other words, to almost everyone. In fact, my opinion is that many of them (for whatever reasons) will not be receptive. Why? Perhaps they reject any ideas presented within an allegory. Or perhaps they strongly disagree with Blanchard and Johnson about what can be accomplished in only a minute.<br />I think it is a thoughtful. well-written, immensely practical book. Just as in my review of Spencer Johnson's The One Minute Sales Person I recommended that sales managers provide a copy of it to each new salesperson, I now strongly recommend that management supervisors provide a copy of The One Minute Manager to anyone for whom they become responsible. I also think that senior-level executives would be well-advised to re-read both books from time to time.

(The Twins won 90 games this past season and had just defeated the Yankees in the first game of the American league playoffs.) As Fraley notes, the Twins are renowned for how they treat their people. One of them is Al Newman who is currently struggling with a life-threatening illness. Here's a brief excerpt from Fraley's article:<br />\\"When beloved third-base coach Al Newman was hospitalized in Chicago this month because of a brain hemorrhage, general manager Terry Ryan remained with him for the entire 11-day stay. While Newman was hospitalized, the Twins clinched the Central title at home. Manager Ron Gardenshire stopped the postgame celebration, brought out Newman's uniform top and reminded the crowd of what he had done for the club.\\"<br />If I understand George's key points in Authentic Leadership, both Ryan and Gardenshire offer examples of it. Specifically, they demonstrate \\"the highest integrity, [are] committed to building enduring organizations...who have a deep sense of purpose and are true to their core values...who have the courage to build their companies to meet the needs of all stakeholders, and who recognize the importance of their service to society.\\" George addresses what he views as a need for new leadership when in fact the need is to increase the number of authentic leaders, not only in business but in government, religion, and the military. We need more men and women who \\"genuinely desire to serve others through their leadership...are more interested in empowering the people they lead to make a difference than they are in power, money, or prestige for themselves. They are as guided by qualities of the heart, by passion and compassion, as they are by qualities of the mind.\\"<br />George invites, indeed urgeshis reader to \\"rediscover the secrets of creating lasting value\\" in literally all areas of contemporary life. On page 6, he poses a series of questions and then in the 17 chapters and Epilogue which follow, he responds to each. However insightful those responses may be, and they are, I think the primary purpose of the questions is to guide and inform each reader's consideration of the various issues which those questions suggest. With all due respect to what George so generously shares from his own life and career, the nature and extent of the reader's own engagement in self-exploration will ultimately determine the value of this book.<br />The material is exceptionally well-organized. The quality of writing is first-rate, and especially effective because of the conversational tone of George's observations and suggestions. Although there are frequent references in this book to \\"companies,\\" the questions posed and the issues associated with them are also directly relevant to all other organizations (regardless of size or nature) in which there is a compelling need for authentic leaders. Daily, it seems, there is evidence of such need in news accounts of corruption in all areas of our society. Corporate executives are indicted and convicted of fraud. Officers in the military are demoted, discharged or, in some instances, imprisoned as are clergy in various denominations. Although the reasons for their behavior vary, all of them betrayed the trust of those to whom they were accountable and for whom they were responsible. <br />Authentic leaders are first and foremost authentic human beings. For me, this is George's key point and because it seems so obvious, it may also seem simplistic. On the contrary, he has cut through all the rhetoric and urges his reader to examine her or his core values. For most of us, that is an immensely difficult, perhaps painful experience. In this context, I am reminded of the fact that in The Inferno, Dante reserved the last and worst ringin hell for those who, in a moral crisis, preserve their neutrality. Throughout all manner of organizations, there are women and men who are authentic leaders and should be commended. The reality is, their respective organizations need more of them. More to the point, all of us in our global community need more of them. In his unique and compelling book, George challenges us to join their number.	2003-10-03
963649:US	51147790	R3M33CBBLWKOIE	1578518520	621368309	The Innovator's Solution: Creating and Sustaining Successful Growth	Books	5	45	52	N	N	Certain to Become a Business "Classic"	In a previous work, The Innovator's Dilemma, Christensen examines why so many companies fail to remain competitive \\"when they confront certain types of market and technological change....the good companies -- the kinds that many managers have admired for years and tried to emulate, the companies known for their abilities to innovate and execute....It is about well-managed companies that have their competitive antennae up, listen astutely to their customers....invest aggressively in new technologies, and yet they still lose market dominance.\\" According to Christensen, the innovator's dilemma occurs when the logical, competent decisions of management which are critical to the success of their companies are also the reasons why they lose their positions of leadership. I wholly agree with Christensen that a given problem must first be fully understood before efforts to solve it are initiated. The challenge is even greater when the given problem poses a dilemma which (in essence) involves a paradox: Whatever has been essential to success can also cause failure. What to do?<br /><br />In The Innovator's Solution, Christensen and Raynor offer a wealth of strategies and tactics to solve such a dilemma, revealed by their rigorous research on hundreds of different companies. In their book, they summarize \\"a set of theories that can guide managers who need to grow new businesses with predictable success -- to become disruptors rather than disruptees -- and ultimately kill the well-run, established competitors.\\" More specifically, Christensen and Raynor suggest appropriate responses to situations such as these:<br /><br />o When a disruptive foothold is needed which competitors \\"will be happy to ignore or be relieved to walk away from\\"<br /><br />o When there are opportunities to help customers \\"get done more conveniently and inexpensively what they are already trying to get done\\"<br /><br />o When a low-end disruption is feasible and a business model is therefore necessary \\"that can make attractive profits at the discount prices required to capture customers at the low end of the market\\"<br /><br />o When determining the criteria for selecting members of a management team for a new venture<br /><br />NOTE: Christensen and Raynor correctly suggest that among the most important criteria is sufficient prior experience with solving problems comparable with those the new venture seems certain to encounter.<br /><br />o When disruption (and competing against non-consumption in particular) \\"requires a longer runway before a steep ascent is possible.\\"<br /><br />Christensen and Raynor have no illusions whatsoever about the difficulties of creating and then sustaining successful growth, however \\"growth\\" may be defined and measured. Moreover, they observe \\"To our knowledge, no company has been able to build an engine of disruptive growth and keep it running and running.\\"<br /><br />Among the many reasons why I admire this book so much is its direct relevance to decision-makers in organizations which have already achieved success and seem to sustaining it. Better yet, let's say, these organizations dominate their competition in the given marketplace. As Christensen and Raynor explain so convincingly, the causes of that success may well prove to be the causes of eventual failure. Therefore, all organizations (regardless of size or nature) must be involved in what Schumpeter once described as \\"creative destruction,\\"especially when highly successful, inorder to free themselves from what O'Toole calls \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" As I see it, there are two options which can be posed in a question: Would you rather have creative but prudent \\"destruction\\" within your organization or have your organization disrupted (perhaps obliterated) by its competition? Well duh.<br /><br />For many decision-makers who read The Innovator's Solution, I think it will prove be the most valuable business book they ever read. Why?  Because it will guide and inform their efforts with associates to design, activate, and then maintain \\"a well-functioning disruptive growth engine.\\" Even then,  they must keep it mind that no such mechanism will keep \\"running and running\\" forever. Improvisation and adaptability are imperative. Eventually, a new \\"engine\\" will be required but at least they will possess the knowledge and experience needed to produce another one.uide and inform their efforts with associates to design, activate, and then maintain \\"a well-functioning disruptive growth engine.\\" Even then,  they must keep it mind that no such mechanism will keep \\"running and running\\" forever.

Mike Beer served as the adviser to Richard Luecke while he wrote this volume. Brief information about both is provided. There are seven chapters following an Introduction in which Luecke observes that \\"Accepting the necessity and inevitability of change enables [all companies and their decision-makers] to see times of transition not as threats but as opportunities -- opportunities for reinventing the company and its culture.\\" Indicators include a merger, acquisition, or divestiture; the launch of a new product or service; a new leader; or a new technology. \\"In this book you will learn how to manage change constructively, and how to help your company, division, and people deal with the upheavals of change. You'll also learn practical things you can do to make change initiatives more successful and less painful for the people you manage.\\"<br />Each of the seven chapters (which are arranged in a logical sequence) focuses on a separate but related component of effective management of change and transition. For example, in Chapter 2, Luecke explains why leaders must be respected and effective for change to happen, the role of motivation in change-readiness, the importance of a nonhierarchical culture in implementing change, and then offers several \\"tips\\" on how to become \\"change ready.\\" To me, one of the most valuable chapters is the sixth (in which Luecke examines the four stages of reaction to change (i.e. shock, defensive retreat, acknowledgment, and acceptance and adaptation), how individuals can help themselves navigate change, how managers can help employees cope with change, and alternative ways for managers to think about change registers.<br />At the conclusion of each of the seven chapters, Luecke offers an especially useful \\"Summing Up\\" section which facilitates a periodic review of key points. I also appreciate the provision of Appendix A (\\"Useful Implementation Tools\\") and Appendix B (\\"How to Choose and Work with Consultants\\"), both of which provide basic but sound information to supplement material covered in the previous chapters.<br />Those who share my high regard for this volume are urged to check out Jim O'Toole's Leading Change, William Bridges' Transitions and Managing Transitions and Jon Katzenbach's Real Change Leaders, all of which are available in paperback editions.of Appendix A (\\"Useful Implementation Tools\\") and Appendix B (\\"How to Choose and Work with Consultants\\"), both of which provide basic but sound information to supplement material covered in the previous chapters.<br />Those who share my high regard for this volume are urged to check out Jim O'Toole's Leading Change, William Bridges' Transitions and Managing Transitions and Jon Katzenbach's Real Change Leaders, all of which are available in paperback editions.	2003-09-24
964610:US	51147790	RTEJNSFJSW0L2	157675183X	1753726	Accountability: Freedom and Responsibility without Control	Books	4	12	13	N	N	One Reader's Reactions	As I was about to begin reading this book, I was immediately put off by its subtitle: \\"Freedom and Responsibility without Control.\\" That makes absolutely no sense. Without any control, there is chaos. Lebow and Spitzer seem to use the word \\"control\\" with two entirely different meanings in mind. One connotes order and structure; the other connotes manipulation and suppression. In the ideal organization, everyone is personally accountable and in complete agreement about the standards of measurement. Alas, no such organization exists. Never has and never will. Lebow and Spitzer are quite correct when asserting that imposing \\"command and control\\" management on others is much less effective than helping them to assume a greater degree of personal responsibility for the quantity and quality of their work. \\"The key is to find a way to lead people without ruling them!\\" I agree.<br />In this book, they offer a fictitious narrative which begins in Denver as thousands of air travelers are stranded by a severe snowstorm. Pete Williams is among them. He meets Stan (\\"Kip\\") Kiplinger and they begin to discuss their respective business experiences, sharing their thoughts and feelings about leadership and management as they proceed together on a two-day railroad journey to Los Angeles. This is the context within which Lebow and Spitzer examine what they call a \\"dilemma\\": whether to commit to a freedom-based or control-based work environment. Although frequently careless with nomenclature and in their analysis of cause-and-effect relationships, Lebow and Spitzer nonetheless effectively use the extended exchanges between Pete Williams and Stan (\\"Kip\\") Kiplinger to explain how and why a freedom-based work environment is highly preferable to a control-based work environment.<br />I was curious to learn if Lebow and Spitzer view them as mutually-exclusive. Apparently the answer is both \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\": Yes if the control is established and then maintained over one person by another...No if an individual assumes personal accountability, thereby assuming responsibility also for her or his self-control. If I understand Lebow and Spitzer correctly (and I may not), the core issue in this context is one of ultimate authority. Where does it lie? Is it granted? If so, by whom? Or is it seized? Then what?<br />Time out. In creating Minds, Howard Gardner examines the lives and achievements of Sigmund Freud, Albert Einstein, Pablo Picasso, Igor Stravinsky, T.S. Eliot, Martha Graham, and Mohandas Gandhi. However different they may be in most other respects, they all possessed superior intelligence and exceptional self-discipline. Each illustrates a paradox: the extent to which they were free to achieve what they did was dependent almost entirely on the extent to which they could control their talents and skills. The same is true of peak performers in the business world. For example, Michael Dell, Henry Ford, Bill Gates, William Hewlett & David Packard, Ray Kroc, Steve Jobs, Akio Morita, Ted Turner, Sam Walton, and Thomas Watson Jr. True, all were CEOs and at least one, Ford, was (by all accounts) a tyrant. My point is, they and other peak performers in their respective organizations all demonstrate the importance of personal accountability, of what David Reisman once described as inner-directed motivation. But what about so many others who are unwilling and/or unable to assume at least some degree of personal responsibility for their efforts, even within what Lebow and Spitzer would characterize as a freedom-based environment?<br />In my opinion, there is nothing inherently wrong with any of what Lebow and Spitzer call \\"Ten Control-Based Ideas That Destroy Accountability.\\" There are countless organizations, ones which have a freedom-based environment, in which most (if not all) of the ten are well-received, indeed deeply appreciated. I am in full agreement with Lebow and Spitzer's core assertion previously acknowledged. Where we part company is the point at which, in my opinion, their cynicism seizes control of the narrative. This is most evident on page 227 when, for example, they assert that incentive programs and pay-for-performance plans \\"promote cheating and distract people from doing the `right thing' by encouraging the practice of `going for the dough no matter what!'\\" Or consider their repudiation of employee recognition programs because they \\"discount the contributions of those who are not recognized, encourage suck-ups, and foster office politics.\\" In some organizations, granted, that may well be true. But of all? Or even of most?<br />According to Lebow and Spitzer, organizations \\"get\\" people to be accountable by granting individual freedom as a right, by asking everyone to be personally responsible, and by having faith in people. Which individual freedoms? Why is each a \\"right\\"?  Should all effort be voluntary? What if at least some people refuse to be personally responsible, claiming their refusal as a right? How to respond to people who are chronically tardy, careless, wasteful, rude, etc.? Especially those who consider such behavior acceptable, indeed insist that it is an entitlement?<br />After reading and then re-reading the book, this has been an especially difficult review for me to compose because I agree with Lebow and Spitzer on several key points (e.g. \\"Attributes of High-Performance Freedom-Based Operations\\" on page 61) while disagreeing completely with them on so many others (e.g. what I consider to be a worthless \\"Freedom Survey\\" on pages 229-235). My rating correctly indicates my ambivalence. I wish a Three-and-a-Half Star rating were available.

What if there had been no Lend-Lease program? What if all of the British troops had been trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk? In that event, what if an invasion of England had then succeeded? What if Hitler had not invaded Russia? Blackburn never directly addresses questions such as these but they are nonetheless relevant to his core thesis that the Allies were ill-prepared in 1939 to fight what became World War Two. The question \\"Where the hell are the guns?\\" could well be re-phrased \\"Where the hell is everything and everyone we need to defeat the German army?\\" As in the other two volumes, Blackburn's focus is on his own experience with the Canadian 4th Field Regiment. The circumstances in which he and his comrades found themselves in 1939 are representative of virtually all other Allied forces at that time: Not having anywhere near enough of the materiel they needed...and most of what they did have was obsolete. Nonetheless, by the time of the Normandy Invasion in June of 1944, the Canadian 4th Field Regiment had become among the most highly effective of all Allied fighting units as, by then, an Allied victory was assured. This volume carefully traces that difficult process of preparation and subsequent achievement from May of 1939 through July of 1944.<br />In The Divine Comedy, Dante reserves the last and worst ring in hell for those who, in a moral crisis, preserved their neutrality. I was reminded of that as I read and then re-read the three volumes. Although each was written from Blackburn's perspective with the material anchored in his personal experience with the Canadian 4th Field Regiment, he fully understands and appreciates difficulties concerning logistics throughout the Allied military forces. My previous use of the word \\"scrambled\\" correctly describes Allied efforts (1939-1942) to assemble the men and (yes) women needed to train, equip them, and then deploy to greatest military advantage. Errors of judgment were obviously inevitable. However, Blackburn never hesitates to criticize certain military leaders who, in a moral crisis, preserved their neutrality. Throughout World War Two, so many courageous Allied troops were needlessly killed or wounded because of their leaders' timidity and indecision or concern for their own image. (Churchill once referred to then prime minister Neville Chamberlain as being \\"a sheep in sheep's clothing.\\")  At best, war is messy and often brutal. Casualties are inevitable. Nonetheless, Blackburn correctly asserts that much of the anxiety during 1939-1944 could have been alleviated by more efficient and more effective leadership at all levels of Allied military operations.<br />In the concluding chapter, Blackburn includes a brief excerpt from James Hilton's Good-bye, Mr. Chips when the dying schoolmaster recalls happier times long ago: \\"What a host of little incidents, all deep-buried in the past -- problems that had once been urgent, arguments that had once been keen, anecdotes that were funny only because one remembered the fun. Did any emotion really matter when the last trace of it vanished from human memory; and if that were so, what a crowd of emotions clung to him as their last home before annihilation! He must be kind to them, must treasure them in his mind before their long sleep.\\"  More than 60 years ago, Blackburn and his comrades in the Canadian 4th Field Regiment began a process of preparation, together with millions of other Allied forces, to face arguably one of the greatest military opponents throughout history. In the three volumes, Blackburn (like Charles Chipping) reflects back on his experiences, recalling persons and events with respect, appreciation, and affection. By sharing his wartime reminiscences and reflections, his joys and irritations, as well as the lessons he learned and the values which prevailed throughout those \\"anxious years\\" long ago, the  significant \\"little incidents\\" will remain vivid for generations to come, rather than \\"deep-buried in the past.\\"ping) reflects back on his experiences, recalling persons and events with respect, appreciation, and affection.

One of my favorite sources of information is John Keegan's The Face of Battle in which he explains combat experience from the perspective of those who were directly involved at Agincourt (1415), Waterloo (1815), and the Somme (1916).  According to the first-hand accounts on which Keegan relies, films such as Paths of Glory, Pork Chop Hill, and most recently Saving Private Ryan probably offer about as realistic a visual account as is possible. However, as Ken Burns demonstrated when calling upon various sources for the narrative of his television series on the Civil War, first-hand accounts have unsurpassed authenticity and credibility. For that reason, I hold George Blackburn's work in such high regard. In each of his three volumes based on his own experiences with the Canadian 4th Field Regiment during World War Two, he enables his reader to know precisely what he was thinking and feeling as well as what he was encountering during the Normandy Invasion, during the Battle for the Rhineland, and then during the final months of the war.<br />In this volume as in The Guns of Normandy, Blackburn brilliantly uses two strategies to present his narrative: the present tense (to invest the material with immediacy) and the second person voice (to engage his reader in each situation, albeit vicariously). This volume offers so much technical information but always within a human context. For example, consider this brief passage in which Blackburn explains the symbolic importance of guns (as opposed to rifles) which bears striking resemblance to the importance pilots assign to the carriers on which they and their squadrons are based. In this instance, Blackburn describes what is (in effect) a warrior's reunion with artillery:<br />\\"You get the feeling that you are visiting a very strange place -- one of the most welcoming places you will ever visit in your whole life --even though you are conscious that tomorrow, or before today is out, this field will be abandoned, never to be seen again by you or any of these fellows. How strange that something that has no permanence by way of form or location should become fixed in your mind as something of substance, something reliable to be counted on in this shaky, impermanent world, an island of stability and order in a churning ocean of disorder, an ultimate refuge to which you can withdraw if everything else disintegrates: home.\\" Surely this is passage could also describe a weary survivor of the air war in the Pacific as he prepares to return to his carrier, \\"an island of stability and order in a churning ocean of disorder, an ultimate refuge to which [he] can withdraw if everything else disintegrates: home.\\"<br />By the time we reach the conclusion of this volume, we fully understand the meaning and significance of the quotation from Kipling with which Blackburn concludes Part Four. Specifically, the last line \\"The guns, thank God, the guns.\\" Perhaps Blackburn will not object if I presume to thank God also for those \\"in baggy pants covered with mud, their boots and socks always wet.\\"you are conscious that tomorrow, or before today is out, this field will be abandoned, never to be seen again by you or any of these fellows.

Rather, and infinitely more valuable, Blackburn offers an eyewitness account. He was there. True, no individual could possibly know everything that was happening on June 6th and thereafter, be everywhere along the beaches and later during the advances inland, etc. Blackburn never makes that claim. His purpose, rather, is to allow his reader to accompany him as he and his associates made their way through an understandably messy, confusing, terrifying, and ultimately humbling ordeal.<br />As indicated in this volume, he possesses all of the skills of a military historian in combination with the talents of a world-class novelist except that what he has produced is eloquent and compelling non-fiction. His writing skills remind me of Yann Martel's in his brilliant Life of Pi, technically a work of fiction but one in which human experience is elevated to levels of clarity and intensity I am unable to describe.<br />Blackburn celebrates the human spirit when confronted with seemingly insurmountable obstacles and impossible barriers. He makes especially effective use of second-person narrative and present tense by which to invest his eyewitness account with both immediacy and authenticity. To the extent possible, he allows his reader to be right there with him as he prepares for and then becomes centrally involved in the largest, most extensive, and most complicated military operation ever undertaken, before or since. Chilling, heart-rending, inspiring, but always credible. Time and again I found myself saying \\"So THAT is what it was really like.\\" Otherwise, how would I know? I was eight years old when the Normandy Invasion began.<br />This volume is one of three in a trilogy which Blackburn wrote inorder to share his personal experiences throughout World War II. (I have not as yet read Where the Hell Are the Guns?: A Soldier's view of the Anxious Years, 1939-44 and The Guns of Victory: A Soldier's Eye View, Belgium, Holland, and Germany, 1944-45, but plan to.) One personal note. Several years ago, it was my great privilege to assist with efforts to raise funds for indigent recipients -- NOT \\"winners\\" -- of the Congressional Medal of Honor. I worked with and became close friends with several recipients who were determined to assist comrades who had fallen upon hard times.

Throughout history, some despicable people (e.g. Adolph Hitler) have demonstrated the power of charisma but we tend to explain it, rather, as a positive, desirable quality, associating it with those whom we admire, respect, and trust (e.g. Mohandas Gandhi). In this context, of special interest to me is Jim Collins' assertion that many of the CEOs of the good-to-great companies he studied are not charismatic.<br />According to information provided by Princeton University Press which published Search for a Corporate Savior: The Irrational Quest for Corporate CEOs, Rakesh Khurana shares what he learned from a rigorous research of the hiring and firing of CEOs at over 850 of America's largest companies and from extensive interviews with CEOs, corporate board members, and consultants at executive search firms. \\"He explains the basic mechanics of the selection process and how hiring priorities have changed with the rise of shareholder activism. Khurana argues that the market for CEOs, which we often assume runs on cool calculation and the impersonal forces of supply and demand, is culturally determined and too frequently inefficient. Its emphasis on charisma artificially limits the number of candidates considered, giving them extraordinary leverage to demand high salaries and power. It also raises expectations and increases the chance that a CEO will be fired for failing to meet shareholders' hopes. The result is corporate instability and too little attention to long-term strategy.\\"<br />All this is shared to create a context for comments on Benton's most recent book. In it, she offers a six-step process to develop \\"executive charisma: Be the first to initiate; expect and give acceptance to maintain esteem (yours as well as others'); ask questions and ask favors; stand tall, straight, and smile; be human, humorous, and hands-on; and finally, slow down, shut up, and listen. Obviously Benton agrees with Napoleon Hill (Think and Grow Rich) and Dale Carnegie (How to Win Friends and Influence People) who affirm the same values, as do more recent authors such as Jim O'Toole, Stephen Covey, Daniel Goleman, John Maxwell, and David Maister.<br />Merely listing the six steps in no way detracts from Benton's thorough analysis of each. She correctly insists that all should be developed sequentially; they are separate but interdependent. For that reason, their full development should be carefully integrated. As my reviews of her previous books indicate, her titles can be somewhat misleading. For example, when explaining how to think and act like a CEO, she is NOT suggesting that if you read those two books, you will become a CEO. The same is true of the title of this book. Benton does not suggest that by reading it you will become charismatic. If I understand her correctly, her purpose rather is to suggest how to increase what is generally referred to as \\"personal magnetism\\": that is, becoming more attractive to others by earning their admiration respect, and trust. My own experience indicates that charismatic people have an inherent authenticity in terms of their beliefs, values, and behavior. Charlatans also have some glitter but lack integrity and are inevitably found out.<br />One other point I wish to stress (on Benton's behalf) is that she did not write this book only for executives unless the word's meaning is extended to include anyone who takes action (executes) and/or calls upon others to do so. Benton's six-step process has obvious relevance to the world of commerce but also to education, athletics (especially youth sports), public service, healthcare, and (yes) religious organizations. There seem to be two quite different forms of charisma: cosmetic (of short duration such as a sparkler) and organic (of extended duration such as the bunsen burner). The former is expedient. The latter is authentic. The real deal. The right stuff. Call it whatever you will.<br />Not everyone can develop a dazzling personality but, as Benton asserts, everyone can become worthy of others' admiration respect, and trust. And that is as true of the CEO of a major corporation as it is of the volunteer who coaches that CEO's daughter or granddaughter on a youth soccer team.uration such as the bunsen burner).

Krames has an excellent concept for this book: select several exceptional corporate leaders, examine each in terms of a specific objective to which both he and his organization are fully committed, and then explain what can be learned from HOW that objective is conceived. Of course, he could have selected a different seven...or perhaps add several others to those he did. Few can question the inclusion of Dell, Welch, Gerstner, Grove, Gates, Kelleher, and Walton. After  explaining \\"What Made Them Great\\" in Part 1, Krames devotes a chapter to each in Part 2 as he explains those defining strategies which have made each exceptional. I commend Krames for including exercises which actively engage the reader's mind. For example, a brief scenario \\"that puts the reader in the seat of the [given] CEO.\\" Krames offers a series of  business situations which enable his readers \\"to test their business acumen against that of each of the seven subject CEOs.\\" Each chapter is filled with various lessons as well as \\"Assess Your CEO Quotient\\" questions which can be asked both of the individual and of her or his own organization. Throughout his narrative, Krames also inserts brief comments from the works of business thinkers such as Peter Drucker and Philip Kotler so as to provide different perspectives on the given business issue.<br />Here are the seven CEOs and their respective defining strategies:<br />Michael Dell: Place the customer at the epicenter of the business model<br />Jack Welch: Create an authentic learning organization<br />Lou Gerstner: Focus on solutions<br />Andy Grove: Prepare the organization for [in italics] drastic change<br />Bill Gates: Harness the intellect of [in italics] every employee<br />Herb Kelleher: Create a performance-driven culture<br />Sam Walton: Learn from competitors, but remain faithful to the vision<br />Listing the CEOs and their respective defining strategies is easy to do. The great value of this book is derived from Krames's rigorous analysis of each CEO and defining strategy within the context of their respective organizations. The reader learns not only the WHAT but also the HOW and WHY. I agree with Krames that these seven as well as other exceptional leaders have much in common: an \\"outside-in\\" perspective; an evangelical leadership gene; an understanding of the critical role of culture; a passion to create next-generation products, processes, or solutions; a determination to implement the best ideas, regardless of their origin; and, meanwhile, a commitment to increase and thereby advance the leadership body of knowledge. This is an exceptional book about exceptional leadership, one which I highly recommend to business students and recent graduates as well as to those well along in their business careers. I also presume to insist that maximum value will be derived only if the various \\"Assess Your CEO Quotient\\" questions are answered with appropriate care and then rigorously evaluated. Stated another way, there is much to learn from the CEOs but perhaps even more can be learned from these self-audits.is of each CEO and defining strategy within the context of their respective organizations.

He later wrote The Marketing Imagination (1986) which remains \\"must reading\\" for anyone directly or indirectly involved with marketing. There are several excellent recently published books on brand management and this is certainly one of the best. As its subtitle correctly indicates, Moser explains \\"how to create a cohesive brand that's seen, heard, and remembered.\\" In the proverbial nutshell, that has become one of brand managers' primary objectives: To create a multi-sensory experience for the consumer which increases, enhances, and sustains the appeal of the given brand. Moser draws upon more than 25 years of experience in the agency world, having worked closely with a number of major corporations (e.g. Kia Motors, Cisco Systems, and Dell) to formulate a \\"brand road map\\" based on a template which, until now, has been inaccessible to most organizations. What he offers in this book is a step-by-step process by which to create cohesive brand strategies.<br />As Moser explains with meticulous care, citing examples along the way, there are four components of a brand: Core values (the foundation of any organization), brand message (the overall key message which must be communicated effectively), brand personality (the overall tone and attitude with which to deliver the brand message), and finally, brand icons (executional tools which help to deliver the brand message...all of the various elements that make all of an organization's marketing materials uniquely its own). These four components provide the foundation of a \\"brand road map\\" which, like all other roadways, requires conscientious maintenance to ensure expeditious delivery of the brand message to its destination.<br />Moser leaves no doubt whatsoever that this process is very difficult, requires an abundance of time and energy, and is subject to all manner of perils such as internal resistance which Jim O'Toole characterizes as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\"  Why bother? \\"Capturing the essence of your brand [whatever or whoever it may be] and putting it into a form that's clear and concise will help ensure that your brand has the tools necessary to be seen heard, and remembered in the marketplace for years to come.\\" Presumably Moser agrees with this follow-up thought which I now share: Even if Levitt and Moser personally worked closely with you and your associates on the formulation of a \\"road map\\" for your organization, it will be essentially worthless unless and until your brand (be it a product or service or both) is of the highest possible quality.<br />Readers of this brilliant book will be pleased and relieved that Moser's approach is eminently practical. His text is mercifully free of jargon. He seems determined to help any and all who would otherwise not have access to a step-by-step process which has been used for years by large corporations, branding experts, and brand consultancies as well as by multinational corporate identity firms and advertising agencies. Understanding this process will help those who read his book to achieve some of the same brand insights, brand focus, and brand consistency now delivered by various proprietary formulas.d is subject to all manner of perils such as internal resistance which Jim O'Toole characterizes as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\"  Why bother? \\"Capturing the essence of your brand [whatever or whoever it may be] and putting it into a form that's clear and concise will help ensure that your brand has the tools necessary to be seen heard, and remembered in the marketplace for years to come.\\" Presumably Moser agrees with this follow-up thought which I now share: Even if Levitt and Moser personally worked closely with you and your associates on the formulation of a \\"road map\\" for your organization, it will be essentially worthless unless and until your brand (be it a product or service or both) is of the highest possible quality. <br />Readers of this brilliant book will be pleased and relieved that Moser's approach is eminently practical.

1040157:US	51147790	R9OSHLO6O92RS	1578512662	66587643	20/20 Foresight: Crafting Strategy in an Uncertain World	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Measuring Degrees of Probability Amidst Uncertainty	Courtney and his McKinsey associates decided to launch within their firm the Strategy Theory Initiative (STI), a multi-year research effort whose objective was to identify, develop, and disseminate what they learned about a \\"better approach\\" to the immensely challenging complicated design/implementation process. (While reading the Preface to this book, I was reminded of one version of a Hebrew aphorism,  \\"Man plans and then God howls with laughter.\\") The material is carefully organized within seven chapters. In the first, Courtney shares what he and his research associates learned about crafting strategy in an uncertain world; in the next chapter, we are introduced to what are called \\"The Four Levels of Residual Uncertainty.\\" (All by itself, this chapter is well worth far more than the cost of the book.) Then on to address five separate but related questions:<br />* Should we shape or adapt?<br />* Should we begin the process now or later?<br />* Should we focus or diversify?<br />* Which new tools and frameworks are needed?<br />* Which new strategic-planning and decision-making processes are needed?<br />Of course, Courtney fully realizes that the revelations of the STI research can only guide and inform appropriate answers to questions such as these. He agrees with Mike Hammer that searching for a \\"silver bullet\\" is a fool's errand, noting that \\"there [is] no easy one-size-fits-all solution that could be translated from theory into practice. Business strategists needed new theory [and, in italics] new practices if they wanted to make better strategy choices.\\"<br />At the height of the Cold War, I recall someone noting that Russian historians  could predict the past with absolute certainty. This book's title does not suggest that if you read this book, you can see the future. (\\"Man plans and then God laughs.\\") Rather, instead of burying uncertainties in meaningless base case forecasts or avoiding rigorous analysis of uncertainties altogether, Courtney suggests that we \\"embrace uncertainty, explore it,, slice it, dice it, get to know it.\\" If we do this well? \\"[You] will reach a wonderful goal: 20/20 foresight.\\" The best available information serves as the basis of the most reliable forecasts which, in turn, improve the chances of devising the soundest strategies.<br />After summarizing the appropriate toolkit for each level of residual uncertainty (see figures 6-1 through 6-4), and having also suggested various tools and frameworks needed to develop 20/20 foresight, Courtney offers five additional tools in the Appendix: The Uncertainty Toolkit. He briefly but brilliantly explains how to use scenario planning, game theory, decision analysis, system dynamics models, and management \\"flight simulators.\\" Although this book will obviously be of substantial value to senior-level executives in larger organizations, I think it will be invaluable to others such as CEOs and other decision-makers in small companies. The challenge for all of them is to \\"tailor strategy to the level of uncertainty,\\" whatever the nature and extent of their competitive marketplace may be. Here in a single volume is about all they need to begin the process. Another thought: This book would be an excellent choice as the basis of a one-day or (preferably) two-day offsite executive \\"retreat\\" for strategic planning. Reading it in advance would be required. The first two chapters would be excellent for assisting situation analysis, then on to the next five chapters which could serve as the core of the agenda. (I also recommend that Hammer's The Agenda be consulted, at least by the person who leads the group discussion. And, by the way,  that person should NOT be the CEO.) The session would conclude with a review of the consensus achieved, followed by a discussion of how to communicate and collaborate effectively while using various tools, including the five recommended in the Appendix.<br />Courtney would be the first to point out that, over time, other sources ofinformation and guidance may become necessary. For that reason, he includes clusters of annotated \\"Recommended Readings\\" to assist his reader's selection process. Thoughtfully, he adds to their number with other suggestions within his extensive notes.<br />For at least some individual executives and some organizations, this may well prove to be for them the most valuable business book published during the first decade of the 21st century.<br />To those who share my high regard for it, I specifically want to recommend (again) Hammer's book as well as Jim O'Toole's Leading Change, Jason Jennings' Less Is More: How Great Companies Use Productivity As a Competitive Advantage, Peter Schwartz' The Art of the Long View: Paths to Strategic Insight for Yourself and Your Company, and finally, Carla O'Dell's If Only We Knew What We Know: The Transfer of Internal Knowledge and Best Practice.of information and guidance may become necessary.

(It is human nature to resent being required to act against our beliefs and our values. Some people have died rather than doing so.) If you agree with me so far, then perhaps you will agree that the meaning of \\"values-based leadership\\" depends almost entirely on what a given leader believes. Moreover, her or his leadership behavior will be determined by those values. They could include greed, arrogance, and contempt for others or generosity, humility, and respect for others. All this seems pretty basic, indeed obvious to me. Throughout history, the range of leaders is wide and diverse. Evil leaders in the 20th century obviously include Hitler and Stalin. Other leaders contemporary with them obviously include Churchill. All three had very strong beliefs, were committed to quite specific values, and behaved accordingly. I mention all this by way of suggesting the context of the remarks which follow.<br /><br />What we have here is a profile-narrative (rather than a biography) which focuses on the life and career of James Despain up to, of course, the completion of this book's manuscript. Like most of those who read this book, Despain's parents and childhood experiences had a significant impact on his values as he worked his way through the Caterpillar organization, rising to a senior-level executive position while marrying and then starting a family along the way. Of special interest and value to me are the the lessons he learned during his attempts to change the culture of the workplace in which he and his associates struggled to achieve the objective set for them by management. In time, he became an important part of the same management structure (in and of itself a culture resistant to change) and learned other lessons from his involvement with it.<br /><br />The Appendix (pages 189-198) offers a series of summaries of key points. As Despain learned to his dismay, frustration, and occasional disappointment, it is far easier to formulate lists such as \\"Our Common Values\\" and \\"Our Common Values Leadership Guide\\" than it is to (a) achieve a consensus of agreement on the points listed, (b) effectively engage everyone in a collaborative commitment to the values, and finally (c) to sustain that shared commitment over an extended period of time, especially when there are serious problems to be solved. My own rather extensive experience with culture change has convinced me (and perhaps Despain) that the single greatest barrier is what Jim O'Toole characterizes as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\"<br /><br />Although there are no cutting-edge ideas in this book, it does offer a comprehensive explanation of how and why effective leadership focuses on people; also and more importantly,  how and why the process of value-based leadership -- if the values affirm trust, mutual respect, teamwork, empowerment, prudent risk taking, a sense of urgency, continuous improvement, and commitment to the highest quality of customer service -- can enable any organization (regardless of size or nature) to achieve \\"unbelievable, sustainable performance and the personal joy it brings.\\" I agree with Despain that value-based leadership so defined can thus unlock greatness in every individual and thereby ensure dignity for all.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out David Maister's Practice What You Preach: What Managers Must Do to Achieve a High Achievement Culture, O'Toole's Leading Change: The Argument for Values-Based Leadership, Ronald Heifetz's Leadership Without Easy Answers, and Danny Cox's Leadership When the Heat's On (Second Edition)..

Other than a few exceptions such as the release of a new film or an announcement of deep-discount airline fares, I agree with the Rieses' comprehensive assertion that \\"You can launch new brands only with publicity or public relations (PR). PR allows you to tell your story indirectly through third-party outlets, primarily the media....Advertising should follow PR in both timing and theme. Advertising is a continuation of public relations by other means [a nice variation by the Rieses on one of von Clausewitz' core concepts] and should be started only after a PR program has run irs course. Furthermore, the theme of an advertising program should repeat the perceptions created in the mind of the prospect by the PR program.\\"<br />I agree completely. Unfortunately, the Rieses make the essentially the same assertion over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again throughout their book. Long ago, I believe it was John Hill who said that public relations worthy of the name should be \\"truth well-told.\\" Again, I completely agree. Perhaps PR's primary objective is merely to explain with information (exposition)...or to make vidid with compelling details (description)...or to explain a process or sequence with information (narration)...or to convince with logic and/or evidence (argumentation). If the primary objective of public relations is brand building, all four levels of discourse will probably be required. Of course the Rieses fully understand all this. Indeed, as you may recall, their core assertion is that effective public relations (NOT advertising) is essential to successful brand building. What they neglect to point out is that there are unlimited needs for \\"truth well-told,\\" many of which have absolutely nothing to do with commerce.<br />This book is worth reading. Much of what the Rieses suggest is thought-provoking. The content is solid. The writing is serviceable, although constantly recycling the same ideas becomes is tedious and then irritating. (On several occasions, I exclaimed aloud \\"I got it! I got it! Enough already!

On the contrary, as Weissman explains so thoroughly and eloquently, each one of us every day is almost constantly telling a \\"story\\" in one form or another to achieve one or more of these objectives: to explain with information (exposition)...or to make vidid with compelling details (description)...or to explain a process or sequence with information (narration)...or to convince with logic and/or evidence (argumentation). The most effective formal presentations are those which make maximum use of all four levels of discourse. It is also worth mentioning that, although percentages vary from one research study to another, the impact of a face-to-face encounter is estimated to be as follows: body language 60-70%, tone of voice 15-20%, and content (i.e. what is actually said) about 10-15%. Skilled recruiters claim that more often than not, they have already made a decision about a candidate before the interview formally begins. In fact, it begins at the initial point of physical contact.<br />So, I think this book can be of greatest value to literally anyone whose communication skills (both verbal and non-verbal) need to be improved. The strategies and tactics which Weissman shares have almost unlimited applications: when making formal presentations and during job interviews, as noted, but also when preparing reports, contributing to group discussions (e.g. strategic planning and especially budget reviews), resolving problems with customer service, implementing crisis management initiatives, and conducting performance reviews.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Stephen Denning's The Springboard: How Storytelling Ignites Action in Knowledge-Era Organizations and Kevin Hogan's The Psychology of Persuasion: How to Persuade Others to Your Way of Thinking.	2003-07-17

His contributions in this book to our understanding of both the difficulties and opportunities to do so are substantial. Acknowledging his academic roots, he acknowledges that he \\"developed an appreciation for a first- principles approach to strategy and decisions...how first principles translate into the framing of trade-offs and lead to timely action.\\" Over time, he learned that true insight \\"comes from connecting the dots across multiple landscapes [and that] such dots lurk in the unlikeliest corners.\\" He allows his reader to recognize those \\"corners\\" and to accompany him as he carefully but rigorously explores the connected world.<br />I especially appreciate his dry but delightful wit, perhaps most evident in the final chapter whose head note is a quotation from Thelonious Monk: \\"You know what's the loudest noise in the world, man? The loudest noise in the world is silence.\\"  Without apparent effort, he invites his reader to consider the significance of the Galton-Gould evolutionary pool table, a metaphor which suggests that a market is the polyhedron-shaped ball.\\" perhaps recalling John Nash's insight, he suggests that when innovation arrives on the scene (i.e. in a market), it creates disequilibrium. \\"It is in this situation of rest [i.e. when the \\"ball\\" has stopped] which may be viewed as gridlock by some and as a stable market by others -- that innovations in a connect must pry apart.\\"<br />Given the process of inquiry and exploration which has been completed in the prior chapters, I was intrigued by how Chakravorti achieves at least a temporary synthesis of so many different (sometimes contradictory) factors which interact throughout the innovation cycle: \\"the eureka moment; the development of technology to give life to an idea; and the creation of an organization to produce and commercialize the innovation.\\" As we all know, few innovative ideas ever reach their intended market and fewer yet survive thereafter.  There is indeed a natural selection process during any campaign to bring an innovation into the connected world. Chakravorti suggests four aspects of that campaign:<br />1. \\"Qualifying the endgame and, in the process, choosing between several strategic options at the outset;<br />2. \\"Orchestrating the changes necessary across the network of players through a mechanism that propagates the innovator's selective interventions into the wider network;<br />3. \\"Actively managing with the critical agents that will pass on the innovation's influence; and<br />4. \\"Making appropriate choices on how to commit to strategies that lead to certain endgames in the face of uncertainty -- depending on the situation, one must choose between making a bet, reserving options, and seeking insurance.\\"<br />Paraphrasing an ancient aphorism, Chakravorti suggests that market imperfection is the mother of innovation because it creates the need to innovate both in terms of a given product or service and in terms of the campaign by which to guide it to market. and then through natural selection to at least temporary security....that is, until another innovation (which accommodates the aforementioned four aspects) eliminates the need for it.<br />I agree completely with Chakravorti that the \\"slow pace of change is good news for the strategic innovator. In fact, it is essential news.\\" Obviously, when any organization plans to take a new product or service to market, it faces formidable competition and all manner of challenges, only some of which are posed by competitors. (How many innovative products or services have never survived internal barriers which may include what Jim O'Toole has characterized as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom\\") In this brilliant book, Chakravorti suggests a number of specific strategies and tactics to help achieve market penetration  and eventual success in a connected world. Thereis also an important lesson to be learned from one of Aesop's fable, &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot;: At least in some situations, only a \\"slow pace\\" can achieve \\"fast change.\\"e is also an important lesson to be learned from one of Aesop's fable, &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot;: At least in some situations, only a \\"slow pace\\" can achieve \\"fast change.\\"	2003-07-17

Moreover, there can be (and is) honest disagreement about the inclusion of some companies and not others. My own opinion is that all of the 50 companies which Rothman selected are worthy of inclusion...as are several others. The great value of this book is that Rothman is more than a list maker and a writer of mini-profiles. As he explains in the Introduction, his purpose is to examine 50 companies \\"that have dramatically and permanently altered us. In the process, you will also see how the general structure of business -- and along with it, our society -- has evolved over the past few centuries. You will meet with some individuals with extraordinary vision, courage, and commitment who struggled to realize their ideas and drive their companies to success. n a very real sense, they are the true forces that have changed our world.\\"<br />According to criteria which are unclear to me, Rothman ranks the 50 in terms of their relative impact: Microsoft is #1 and H.J. Heinz is #50. In doing so, Rothman also invites honest disagreement about his ranking decisions. I certainly disagree with the ranking of Wal-Mart at #10. Oh well. He devotes about four pages to each of the 50 companies, with a \\"Fact File\\" preceding his brief commentary. He also includes a section called \\"Honorable Mentions\\" following by an extensive Bibliography.<br />This is a solid and sensible but not especially thought-provoking book, except to those who disagree with Rothman's selections and ranking of them, one which provides quite a bit of information on companies which have obviously made significant contributions to our society and, in most instances, to the global marketplace in which they have competed. To his Bibliography, I presume to add H.W. Brands's Masters of Enterprise, Stuart Crainer's The Management Century, the Forbes Greatest Business Stories of All Time, and John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge's The Company.	2003-07-14

With few exceptions, the most valuable business books are those in which their authors share the results of efforts to answer especially important questions. That is certainly true of this book. As Pfeffer and Sutton explain, \\"We wrote this book because we wanted to understand why so many managers know so much about organizational performance, say so many smart things about how to achieve performance, and work so hard, yet are trapped in firms that do so many things they know will undermine performance.\\" Obviously, knowing what to do is not enough. Inorder to identify the causes of what they refer to as the \\"knowing-doing gap,\\" Pfeffer and Sutton embarked on a four-year research project.<br /><br />What they learned is shared in this exceptionally informative and thus invaluable book. They organize their material within eight chapters, followed by an appendix in which they provide \\"The Knowing-Doing Survey.\\" This survey of restaurant managers all by itself is worth far more than the cost of the book. The items to which participants respond can easily be modified to accommodate any other kind of business. Moreover, even in small privately-owned companies, it will enable decision-makers to measure the nature and extent of their own \\"knowing-doing gap.\\"<br /><br />Pfeffer and Sutton correctly point out that knowing (in italics) about that gap is different from doing (in italics) something about it. \\"Understanding causes is helpful because such understanding can guide action. But by itself, this knowing is insufficient -- action must occur.\\" Most executives may not be able to eliminate the gap entirely but, guided and informed by what Prefer and Sutton reveal in this book, they can at least reduce the gap. Moreover, those with supervisory responsibilities will also be able to help reduce the gap for each of those for whom they are responsible.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Sydney Finkelstein's Why Smart Executives Fail...and What You Can Learn from Their Mistakes as well as Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan's Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done.n from Their Mistakes as well as Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan's Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done.	2003-07-14

In the Preface, he explains that \\"Every single principle that follows was summoned [key word] within hours of the attacks on the World Trade Center. Surround yourself with great people. Have beliefs and communicate them. See things for yourself. Set an example. Stand up to bullies. Deal with first things first. Loyalty is the vital virtue. Prepare relentlessly. Underpromise and overdeliver. Don't assume a damn thing.\\" Previously I suggested the importance of the word \\"summoned\\" because the leadership which Giuliani provided after the attacks was not improvised extemporaneously. On the contrary, over many years as he explains in this book, he carefully accumulated experiences, sharpened skills, forged relationships, and nourished resources all of which he needed to summon on that fateful day and in the months following. All of them proved essential to his performance as mayor when the events which occurred on September 11, 2001, created greater challenges for him than he had ever encountered before...and in all probability, greater than any he would ever face in the future.<br />Inevitably selective and subjective as all memoirs are, these are focused almost entirely on Giuliani's career while providing an extended explanation of leadership from his perspective. He begins the book with his own account of 9/11/01, then explains how and why 14 key management principles were so important that day, before shifting his and the reader's attention to recovery efforts. Giuliani's remarks throughout the narrative are thoughtful and heartfelt but he seldom allows the reader access to thoughts and feelings unrelated to his evolution as a leader. Although presumably he has several scores to settle, he chose not to do so in this book. If I were asked to suggest a subtitle, it would be something like \\"What I've Learned About Leadership and How I learned It\\" or \\"September 11, 2001: My Leadership Crucible.\\" You get the idea. Concluding this book, Giuliani acknowledges that he felt great anger after the attacks on the World Trade Center but considers that reaction a healthy one. \\"The challenge was to put it to work in ways that would make me a stronger, better leader.\\" By all accounts he succeeded.<br />When Giuliani was selected as Time magazine's \\"2001 Person of the Year,\\" the citation praises him \\"For having more faith in us than we had in ourselves, for being brave when required and rude when appropriate and tender without being trite, for not sleeping and not quitting and not shrinking from the pain all around him.\\"How I learned It\\" or \\"September 11, 2001: My Leadership Crucible.\\" You get the idea.

What can possibly account for the scores of business failures we see each year, in different industries, and even in different countries? And how can we prevent this sort of thing from  happening again?&#34; Finkelstein devoted more than six years of research to answering questions such as these.<br /><br />&#34;My goal was not only to understand why businesses break down and fail, but to focus on the people behind these failures; not only to understand how to avoid these disasters, but to anticipate the early warning signs of failure. Ultimately, I wanted to move beyond ad hoc explanations of failure on a case-by-case basis and expose the roots of these breakdowns in a definitive way.&#34; Whereas Peters and Waterman set out in search of excellence, Finkelstein and his research associates set out in search of  failure...and achieved that objective. What they found and what they learned are now offered in this brilliant book.<br /><br />He organizes his material within three Parts: Great Corporate Mistakes, focusing on four different business challenges: creating successful new ventures, managing mergers and acquisitions, coping with innovation and change, and developing winning strategies in the face of new competitive pressures. In  Part II, he identifies the underlying causes of failure evident even across different types of corporate mistakes. In this Part, Finkelstein offers a deeper analysis of the common patterns of behavior that executives in failing companies exhibited. In Part III, Finkelstein shifts his (and his reader's) attention to explicitly developing two critical ideas that have stayed in the background to this point. &#34;First, can we use the findings of our study as an early warning system? Can our results tell us how to predict when troubler is coming? And second, how do successful executives create organizations that can learn from, and better yet avoid disaster? What can we learn fro them?&#34;<br /><br />Almost everything of any significant value I have learned in my life thus far has been the result of personal experience. And almost everything of value I have learned from that experience involved a failure of some kind. Hence the great importance of this book which examines dozens of &#34;smart executives&#34; who failed. They include Jill Barred at Mattel, Dennis Kozlowski at Tyco, Jean Marie Messier at Vivendi, Robert Pitman at AOL Time Warner, and Wolfgang Schmitt at Rubbermaid. Indeed, the research for this book devoted rigorous attention to senior level executives in 51 different companies of various sizes and nature. Where did even the brightest executives go wrong? What can we learn from their mistakes? How can we avoid repeating those mistakes in the future? In essence, that is what this book is really all about.<br /><br />Long ago, someone made a clever observation that Russian historians always predict the past with absolute accuracy. I recall that comment by way of suggesting that Finkelstein indulges in no gloating whatsoever. There is no indication of any hubris in him even as he examines several victims of that classical affliction. He well realizes -- and with evident dismay -- that the mistakes of any presumably capable executive can sometimes have serious, if not catastrophic implications for hundreds and even thousands of others. He lists and then evaluates seven theories which are frequently offered to explain executive failure. (For example, &#34;The Executives were stupid.&#34;) Next, he explains that before the research began, there were no &#34;crystal-clear hypotheses&#34; with regard to patterns of failure.  Then on to a series of mini case studies which reveal both the executive mistakes and what lessons could be learned from them. Of special interest to me is the set of early warning signs which the research uncovered. They may not prevent others from making mistakes but recognition of them in a timely manner can indeed reduce the potential damage. Also of special interest are the ways Finkelstein formulated by which to diagnose business mistakes as they are happening.<br /><br />It may not have been Finkelstein's initial purpose but in fact what he found during his search for an explanation of executive failure is a wealth of information that can help smart executives to succeed. Obviously, there is so much more involved than merely inverting a serious of mistakes (e.g. cooking the books) and then assuming that (Eureka!) a recipe for certain success has emerged. This is a remarkably thoughtful and sensitive book about human failure. How valuable it proves to be is for each reader to determine. If appropriate, when reviewing other business books, I intend to include this book among those recommended for further reading.<br /><br />I presume to suggest that this book would be an excellent choice to serve as the basis of an off-site meeting of senior level executives. Reading of it in advance would of course be required. I further suggest that the agenda follow the book's structure: Rigorously examine areas in which, over the previous 12-18 months, the organization has either failed or encounted less than the success it desired; next, with equal rigor and (yes) candor, determine the reasons for unsatisfactory performance; finally, determine with meticulous precision the lessons learned and then formulate a game plan to make whatever changes are necessary throughout the organization's operations, with special focus on leadership and management.<br /><br />Of course, I hope this book helps many smart executives to avoid making the mistakes Finkelstein examines. My greater hope (and presumably his is as well) is that countless others who are not directly involved in the decision-making process will be spared the financial and emotional damage that has been inflicted upon their counterparts at companies such as Enron, Tyco, and WorldCom.<br />John Donne was right. &#34;No man is an island.&#34; That is especially true of senior-level executives.vered.

The connections between Roosevelt and Churchill are numerous and significant. Some doubt remains as to how close their personal friendship was but there is no doubt of their mutual respect as together they and their respective nations faced what once seemed certain defeat by the Axis powers in World War II. This book is of special interest to me because it was written by Churchill's granddaughter in collaboration with Littman. Her perspectives are especially significant, given what we learn about Churchill's family life in the excellent biographies written by Martin Gilbert and Roy Evans. Apparently Churchill could often be rather demanding of family members as well as of his staff, especially during England's struggle to survive and then share in the ultimate victory in World War II. In fact, Sandys (with Littman's substantial assistance) focuses most of her attention on her grandfather's inspiring leadership during those darkest of hours.<br />In the Introduction, she acknowledges that she has been frequently asked, \\"When did you realize that your grandfather was a great man?\\" For reasons she explains, she found it impossible to answer. The core question to which she does respond is this: What can be learned from Winston Churchill's leadership? She organizes her material within fourteen chapters, concluding each with a list of what she suggests are \\"Churchillian Principles.\\" For example, at the end of one of my favorite chapters (\\"Follow Your Canvas\\"), she offers these:<br />* Expect the unexpected and you'll find yourself far better prepared to deal with life's twists and turns.<br />* Make your own hours to bring vitality to your work.<br />* Leave time for rest and relaxation, especially when under pressure.<br />* Wise leaders have a hobby or pursuit outside of work that brings them joy.<br />* Never forget the rejuvenating power of a good meal with friends or stimulating company.<br />Sandys was in a unique position to observe Churchill's commitment to these and other principles. Throughout her narrative, she makes appropriate use of Churchill's own statements about all manner of situations, ranging from his conflicts and collaborations with other world leaders to the reasons why he enjoyed painting so much. She offers her own opinions along the way, duly noting her grandfather's warts as well as his halos. This is a serious book, a remarkably thoughtful and sensitive book, but also one which is highly entertaining. I have always regretted never having had the pleasure of Churchill's company. (He would be among the guests invited to a \\"fantasy dinner\\" were it possible for me to host such an event. The others? Homer, Eleanor of Aquitaine, William Shakespeare, Benjamin Franklin, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, and Katherine Hepburn. Wouldn't that be an evening to remember?) I am deeply grateful to Sandys for sharing so much of her personal relationship with Churchill but also for her response to the question previously posed: What can be learned from Winston Churchill's leadership?<br />In the epilogue, she recalls that \\"Even at home taking command was a way of life. On seaside holidays he would direct the family party, his children and those of his brother Jack, in the building of magnificent sand castles. Everyone had a role to play under the direction of the `King of the castle.' He was as excited as the children when at high tide the sea rushed in to fill the moat and eventually destroy the entire day's work.\\" What a fond memory of a singular man who retained \\"almost to the end, his ability to enthrall his audience with wisdom, humor, and humanity.\\"od meal with friends or stimulating company.<br />Sandys was in a unique position to observe Churchill's commitment to these and other principles.

Patton.<br />I recently read two separate but related books, this one and Celia Sandys and Jonathan Littman's We Shall Not Fail: the Inspiring Leadership of Winston Churchill. The connections between Roosevelt and Churchill are numerous and significant. Some doubt remains as to how close their personal friendship was but there is no doubt of their mutual respect as together they and their respective nations faced what once seemed certain defeat by the Axis powers in World War II.<br />The title of his book is obviously derived from Roosevelt's memorable assertion that \\"the American people have nothing to fear but fear itself.\\" In fact, of course, there was much to fear as German armies swept across Europe, conquering and then occupying one country after another. It is almost incomprehensible that while still emerging from the Great Depression, the U.S. became fully involved in two different major wars, one in Europe and another in what is generally referred to as \\"the Pacific.\\" Roosevelt had only recently begun his third term as president when Pearl Harbor was attacked and was dead before World War II ended.<br />Axelrod suggests a number of lessons about which can be learned from Roosevelt performance as president, observing that \\"For FDR leadership was practical inspiration or inspired practicality. Take your pick; the two are impossible to separate, and you cannot tell where one leaves off and the other begins.\\" These lessons are arranged according to fourteen different themes which provide the book with its structure. Axelrod explains that the order of the themes \\"does not reflect the chronology of Roosevelt's life and career, but it is intended to build a coherent picture of FDR as a revealing model of leadership values, ideas, skills, traits, tactics, and strategies. Within each theme, however, the leadership lessons are deployed in chronological order.\\" As is also true of Axelrod's analyses of Elizabeth I and Patton, the material in this book is cleverly organized as well as brilliantly presented. I especially appreciate his selection of appropriate statements by Roosevelt which help to illustrate key points. Here are a four brief excerpts which are representative of Axelrod's thinking and writing.<br />\\"A key to Roosevelt's leadership was his genius for seamlessly joining idealism to practical action. For him the perfect piece of legislation, the perfect social program was one in which it was impossible to tell where theory stopped and practice started. They were one.\\" (pages 3-4)<br />\\"A leader signals in many ways that he is in touch with those he leads: He acknowledges the needs and concerns of the organization. He acknowledges and praises the achievements of the institution. he demonstrates that he shares the values of the organization. And he ensures that he speaks the language of those he leads.\\" (page 74)<br />\\"Leadership of any complex enterprise is rarely a matter of convincing people to `follow me,' but rather a mission to persuade each individual member of the enterprise that he or she has common cause with every other member. This is an especially difficult mission when times are tough and individual [in italics] survival looms larger than the survival of the collective enterprise.\\" (page 173)<br />\\"In any enterprise threat must be recognized. Once acknowledged, it must also be understood that inaction in the face of threat is surrender, not safety. An effective leader always makes the stakes clear. Choosing to fight is dangerous, to be sure, but in many situations opting for the apparently safer course of hunkering down in resolute inaction is simply defeat -- the very consequence one fears in a fight.\\" (page 222)<br />Those who share my high regard for Axelrod's thoughtful and eloquent book are urged to check out two of his other books as well as Celia Sandys and Jonathan Littman's We Shall Not Fail: The Inspiring Leadership of Winston Churchill, all three previously mentioned.

There is a compelling sense of immediacy in Morgan's and McCullough's biographies. That is less true of Isaacson's approach. His primary purpose, rather, is to have his reader understand and appreciate Franklin from a 21st century perspective: \\"We see his reflection in our own time.\\"<br />To at least this reader, it seems as if Isaacson had just returned from a roundtrip visit in a time machine and then at a press conference said \\"Let me tell you all about Benjamin Franklin ...and share my thoughts about his significance to us today.\\" He draws upon the same research sources that other Franklin biographers have. Both halos and warts are duly acknowledged. Of special interest to me is what Isaacson has to say about Franklin's pragmatic approach to both problems and opportunities, from the years of apprenticeship in his brother's printing company in New York until just before his death when he made one final (unsuccessful) attempt to have slavery abolished.<br />When quoting social critic David Brooks's phrase, \\"our founding Yuppie,\\" Isaacson correctly suggests that throughout the 84 years of his life and work, Franklin was sustained by an entrepreneurial spirit. He became \\"America's best scientist, inventor, diplomat, writer, and business strategist, and he was also one of the most practical, though not most profound, political thinkers....But the most interesting thing that Franklin invented, and continually reinvented, was himself.\\"<br />Isaacson carefully organizes his material within sixteen chapters (from \\"Benjamin Franklin and the Invention of America\\" to \\"Sage: Philadelphia, 1785-1790\\") and then in the final chapter shares his \\"Conclusions.\\" I suggest that two of the sections which follow (\\"Cast of Characters\\" and \\"Chronology\\") be read first, thus providing a frame of reference within which to gain a better perspective on the life and work of \\"our founding Yuppie.\\"<br />Each year, I make it a point to re-read Franklin's Autobiography as well as Thoreau's Walden and Emerson's essay \\"Self-Reliance\\" inorder to re-connect with some of the most powerful ideas which have guided and shaped our nation's intellectual history. I have always been especially fascinated by Franklin the man with whom I feel a personal rapport that I do not with Thoreau and Emerson. It is Franklin's compelling humanity which enlightens and sustains Morgan's and Isaacson's correlations of Franklin with the age in which he lived. For these and other reasons, I am deeply grateful to them for increasing and nourishing my appreciation of him.<br />Isaacson's substantial (493-page) but ever-lively examination of Franklin's continuous self-reinvention does indeed leave no doubt whatsoever of his relevance to our own time, centuries later, as we also struggle with a fundamental issue: \\"How does one live a life that is useful, virtuous, moral, and spiritually meaningful? For that matter, which of these attributes is most important?\\" Isaacson goes on to suggest, \\"These are questions just as vital for a self-satisfied age as they are for a revolutionary one.\\" Today and for years to come, how well we answer these questions will to a great extent determine whether or not we prove worthy of a heritage to which Franklin made so many and such unique contributions.haracters\\" and \\"Chronology\\") be read first, thus providing a frame of reference within which to gain a better perspective on the life and work of \\"our founding Yuppie.\\" <br />Each year, I make it a point to re-read Franklin's Autobiography as well as Thoreau's Walden and Emerson's essay \\"Self-Reliance\\" inorder to re-connect with some of the most powerful ideas which have guided and shaped our nation's intellectual history.

Here is an excerpt from Herb Kelleher's presentation at the Risk Management Association's annual conference: &quot;Maintaining excellent customer survives involves a process of  getting people to understand the importance of it to them in their daily lives as well as in others'. We were a little concerned as we got bigger that maybe some of our early culture might be lost so we set up a culture committee whose only purpose is to keep the Southwest Airlines culture alive. Before people knew how to make fire, there was a fire watcher. Cave dwellers may have found a tree hit by lightning and brought fire back to the cave. Somebody had to make sure it kept going because if it went out, there was was the most important person in the tribe. I said to our culture committee, 'You are our fire watchers, who make sure the fire does not go out.  I think you are the most important committee at Southwest Airlines.'   I really do believe that to be the case. We have people come in from all over the world who are interested in our culture because they see it in the customer service aspect of it.&quot;<br />Kelleher then notes that &quot;Southwest Airlines had 162 companies at our last corporate day [open house], which we have twice a year. We started them off that day with the Macarena and they were all wondering, 'Hmmmm....I was looking for E=mc2 and I'm getting the Macarena.' But a fellow from Swiss Air was interviewed when he left and was asked, 'What's the most important message you're taking back to Swiss Air?' And he said 'For everybody to learn to do the Macarena.' Everybody's looking for a single Big Answer, an easy answer such as 'We'll communicate for six months, then get on with something else that's more important.' I keep telling them that the intangibles are far more important than the tangibles in the competitive world because, obviously, you can replicate the tangibles.  You can get the same airplane. You can get the same ticket counters.  You can get the same computers. But the hardest thing for a competitor to match is your culture and the spirit of your people and their focus on customer service because that isn't something you can do overnight and it isn't something you can do without a great deal of attention every day in a thousand different ways. That is why I say that our employees are our competitive protection.&quot;<br />I cannot think of a better introduction to Gittell's book, nor to my comments on her book. Although she identifies \\"Ten Southwest Practices\\" and devotes a chapter to explaining each in Part 2, her key point (and Kelleher's) is that high performance relations are the key to Southwest's success. Gittell includes these comments by a Southwest ramp manager:<br />\\"One thing we cannot teach is attitude toward peers or other groups. There's a code, a way to respond to every individual who works for Southwest. The easiest way to get in trouble is to offend another employee. We need people to respond favorably. It promotes good working relationships....You find an individual with an upbeat and positive attitude -- and you'll find that everything that needs to be done, will get done. It's very contagious.\\" I have been a Southwest frequent flier since 1976. Not once, even once, have I ever had a less-than-pleasant experience with anyone within the Southwest organization. Kelleher is appropriately praised for his vision, charm, business acumen, inspiration, passion, determination, wit, etc. He should also be praised for the leadership he has encouraged and supported at all levels of Southwest. In my opinion, that is his single greatest contribution. As Jim Collins describes it in Good to Great, \\"getting the right people on the bus.\\"<br />In Part 3, Gittell explains how the \\"Ten Southwest Practices\\" reinforce (or undermine) each other; she then suggests what can be learned from Southwest, briefly discussing efforts by competitor airlines; next, she examines how Southwest responds to pressure and manages crises (e.g. September 11); finally, Gittell offers a number of suggestions as to how other organizations can implement high performance relationships. There is nothing wrong with any of those suggestions. However, obviously, listing the \\"Ten Southwest Practices\\" is far, far easier than convincing or inspiring most (if not all) people in another organization to follow them all day, every day, year after year. And it is even more difficult to create such buy-in when an organization is undergoing extensive growth and sustains it profitably as Southwest has. Especially in the ferociously competitive airline industry, the Yoda's admonition is correct: \\"Do or do not. There is no try.\\"briefly discussing efforts by competitor airlines; next, she examines how Southwest responds to pressure and manages crises (e.g. September 11); finally, Gittell offers a number of suggestions as to how other organizations can implement high performance relationships.

Godin has authored a number of best-selling business books, notably Permission Marketing, Unleashing the Ideavirus, and most recently Purple Cow. He introduces and then develops a few core concepts in each, illustrating them with dozens of examples drawn from his extensive experience in marketing. Much as I admire his other books, I think this one is his most thoughtful and most thought-provoking, and therefore his most valuable thus far. True, he anchors his material within the framework of Charles Darwin's scientific research on natural selection. To his credit, Godin does not claim to be a scientist although his curiosity about scientific phenomena is immediately obvious. He allows Darwin to collaborate with him on the formulation of this book's Foreword. Then in the Introduction, Godin observes that he has been fascinated with Darwin's work for a long time and eventually realized that \\"companies are very much like species.\\" However, unlike animals, many business executives \\"fret\\" about all the chaos which surrounds them. They sign with relief when surviving the latest major crisis. Here is one of Godin's key points: \\"I believe that there's a goal beyond survival, that we can actually thrive and find joy in working with all the chaos that surrounds us. That we can look forward to change and turbulence as an opportunity to increase our success.\\" Godin believes that there is a new paradigm developing, \\"a pretty radical way of thinking about business, but one that's nothing new to an evolutionary biologist.\\" Godin wrote this book to explain the paradigm, and, to convince his reader on why her or his enterprise should seize (not merely pursue) all of the new opportunities which that paradigm creates. \\"Transformative success\\" awaits those which do.<br />As I read this book, I was reminded of what Shira White asserts in New Ideas About New Ideas: To generate new ideas, it is first necessary to generate new ideas about how to do that. Otherwise, the results will probably be the same. I have yet to encounter anyone who denies the importance of \\"creative\\" or \\"innovative\\" thinking. We all realize that Edisons are few and far between. However, as White, Godin, and countless others have correctly pointed out, all of us can develop new perspectives and then the requisite skills by which to free ourselves from mindsets which preclude (and often denigrate) creative, innovative thinking. In Leading Change, Jim O'Toole characterizes these mindsets as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" Godin wrote this book to challenge but also to encourage his reader to consider very carefully the reasons why survival is not enough...and never will be. He summarizes his key points in the Introduction (pages 6-8) and then examines each in the ten chapters which follow.<br />One of the book's most valuable sections consists of what Godin characterizes as \\"The Important Questions.\\" Each of the 37 is followed by a brief response and, when appropriate, a related question or two. Sometimes a list, such as of \\"the five elements of an evolving organization\\" (page 230) and \\"ten tactics for companies that want to evolve quickly\\" (page 231). \\"These are questions that can start you, your group and your company on the way to building a zooming organization, one that adapt and respond rather than [merely] react to change.\\" As he does in his other books, Godin once again demonstrates his skills as a pyrotechnical thinker who develops his own nomenclature. Probably because he examines so many correlations between Darwin's scientific research in the mid-19th century and his own experiences in the contemporary business world, Godin includes a Glossary of terms which I think should be read first.<br />Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, Darwin, and the military battlefield are among the conceits which many writers of business books have used to frame their own ideas. More often than not, the correlations seem contrived but that is not true in this instance.  Earlier I presumed to suggest that this is Godin's most important book thus far and now hope that I have offered, in this brief commentary, some reasons why I think so. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, William Bridges' Managing Transitions, John McMillan's Reinventing the Bazaar, and Andrew Hargadon's How Breakthroughs Happen.resumed to suggest that this is Godin's most important book thus far and now hope that I have offered, in this brief commentary, some reasons why I think so.

1080878:US	51147790	RX7YD1QX4RAXF	0393051242	861144841	Globalization and Its Discontents	Books	5	3	6	N	Y	Really, We Have No Other Choice	Stiglitz offers a heartfelt but rigorous analysis of globalization, \\"the removal of barriers to free trade and the closer integration of national economies,\\" asserting that it can and should be a force for good \\"and that it has the potential [in italics] to enrich everyone in the world, particularly the poor.\\" However, given how globalization has been managed thus far, it must be rethought. Focusing primarily on the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the World Bank) during the past decade, Stiglitz responds to the basic question: \\"Why has globalization -- a force that has brought so much good -- become so controversial?\\"<br />Here is an extended excerpt which, I think, will enable those who read this review to decide for themselves whether or not this book is as important as I presume to insist. \\"What we should ask of the international community is only this: the acceptance of their need, and right, to make their own choices, in ways which reflect their own political judgments about who, for instance, should bear the risks [of globalization]. They should be encouraged to adopt bankruptcy laws and regulatory structures adapted to their own situations, not to accept templates designed by and for the more developed countries. What are needed are policies for sustainable, equitable, and democratic growth. This is the reason for development. Development is not about helping a few people get rich or creating a handful of pointless of pointless protected industries that only benefit the country's elite;...Development is about transforming societies, improving the lives of the poor, enabling everyone to have a chance at success and access to health care and education....The developed world needs to do its part to reform the international institutions that seek govern globalization. We set up these institutions [e.g. the IMF and the World Bank] and we need to work to fix them. If we are to address the legitimate concerns of those who have expressed a discontent with globalization, if we are to make globalization world for the billions of people for whom it has not, if we are to make globalization with a human face succeed, then our voices must be raised. We cannot, we should not, stand idly by.\\"<br />Stiglitz's fervent hope is that the developed nations of the world will take full advantage of any and every opportunity to help the underdeveloped nations of the world to become full participants in a \\"new global economy in which growth is not only sustainable and less volatile but the fruits of this growth are equitably shared.\\" Think about it: A world in which illness, hunger, and ignorance have (in effect) been eliminated by a collective effort by developed nations working closely and effectively with underdeveloped nations. Why not? Actually, as Stiglitz explains, there are several significant barriers to accomplishing that. The usual suspects, of course: territorial imperatives, corrupt heads-of-state and corporate executives, knuckle-dragging bureaucrats, etc. But there are also quite legitimate issues to be resolved which have little (if anything) to do with incompetence and corruption: Who owns what? By what laws, rules, and regulations will global collaborations be governed? How will initiatives be financed? By whom? To what extent?<br />In his Preface, Stiglitz asserts \\"We are a global community, and like all communities have to follow rules so that we can live together. These rules must be -- and seem to be -- fair and just, must pay due attention to the poor as well as to the powerful, must reflect a basic sense of decency and social justice. In today's world, those rules have to be arrived at through democratic processes; the rules under which the governing bodies and authorities work must ensure that they will heed and respond to the desires and needs of all those affected by the policies and decisions made in distant places.\\"<br />Sound naive? Unrealistic? Perhaps evensimple-minded? So be it. I wholly agree with Stiglitz.  He has no illusions or delusions with regard to the seriousness of the problems to be solved...nor to the obstacles to those solutions. However, he passionately believes that if enough people of good will can work together, the problems can and will be solved. Count me in, Joseph Stiglitz. Where do I sign up?<br />Those who share my high regard for this volume should also check out Warren Zimmermann's First Great Triumph in which he explains how John Hay, Alfred T. Mahan, Elihu Root, Henry Cabot Lodge, and Theodore Roosevelt achieved for the United States &quot;the first great triumph&quot; of its global expansion or as Zimmermann describes it, &quot;the birth of American imperialism.&quot; I also strongly recommend John McMillan's Reinventing the Bazaar in which he explains that any successful economy \\"has an array of devices and procedures to enable markets to work smoothly. A workable platform has five elements: information flows smoothly; property rights are protected; people can be trusted to live up to their promises; side effects on third parties are curtailed; and competition is fostered.\\" A careful reading of these two books will eliminate whatever doubt (if any) may remain with regard to the legitimacy and urgency of Stiglitz's own concerns about globalization if it continues to be conducted as it has been until now.n simple-minded?

That is especially true of this volume in which Bailyn offers five separate but related essays which, together, examine a theme which its subtitle suggests: the nature and significance of \\"the genius and ambiguities of the American founders.\\" In his Preface, Bailyn identifies two convictions which remain constant throughout all five chapters: that those founders were \\"truly creative people, and that their creative efforts, the generation-long enterprise that elevated these obscure people from their marginal world to the center of Western civilization, were full of inconsistencies, logical dilemmas, and unresolved problems.\\"<br />With regard to questions of compelling importance, several can be summarized as follows:<br />1. Which ambiguities \\"beset\\" Jefferson's career? What were their nature and impact?<br />2. What is revealed by the \\"strange interplay between lofty idealism and cunning realism in Franklin's spectacular success in Paris\\"? Meanwhile, what can be learned from the interplay between Franklin and Adams?<br />3. What is the significance of the fact that the authors of the Federalist papers struggled to reconcile \\"the need for a powerful, coercive public authority with the preservation of the private liberties for which the Revolution had been fought\\"?  To what extent was such a reconciliation achieved?<br />These are indeed compelling questions, ones which probably need to be asked today as our nation struggles to decide what its appropriate role is in the global community. After I read this book but before I began to formulate this review, I read Joseph Stiglitz's Globalization and Its  Discontents. In it, Stiglitz offers a heartfelt but rigorous examination of globalization, \\"the removal of barriers to free trade and the closer integration of national economies,\\" asserting that it can and should be a force for good \\"and that it has the potential [in italics] to enrich everyone in the world, particularly the poor.\\" However, given how globalization has been managed thus far, it should be rethought. Focusing primarily on the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the World Bank) during the past decade, Stiglitz responds to the basic question: \\"Why has globalization -- a force that has brought so much good -- become so controversial?\\"<br />I had Stiglitz's book in mind as I re-read Bailyn's. Granted, no one knew in the late-eighteenth century that the coalition of thirteen colonies (if it achieved independence) would one day become the single most powerful nation in the world. For me, the single greatest benefit of Bailyn's is his analysis of the nature and significance of \\"the genius and ambiguities of the American founders,\\" how they created a foundation on which the original thirteen colonies evolved over more than two centuries into the 50 states and their federal government which now, during arguably the most volatile period since the 1770s, struggles to the support the natural rights of humanity by advocating and supporting what Jefferson once referred to as \\"the sacred fire of freedom and self-government\\" throughout the world. Challenges of various kinds will, of course, continue to present themselves. Bailyn duly acknowledges that reality while suggesting that \\"I think an equally important challenge is our own responsibility to probe the character of our constitutional establishment, as the eighteenth century provincials probed the establishment they faced, to recognize that for many in our own time and within our own culture, it has become scholastic in nits elaboration, self-absorbed, self-centered, and in significant ways distant from the ordinary facts of life.\\"<br />Bailyn's brilliant examination of \\"the genius and ambiguities of the American founders\\" is in essence an examination of the heritage of those founders, revealing the humanity of their talents and imperfections, to be sure, but also suggesting the standards of measurement by which we determine the extent to which we have proven worthy of that heritage.the humanity of their talents and imperfections, to be sure, but also suggesting the standards of measurement by which we determine the extent to which we have proven worthy of that heritage.	2003-06-20

Unleash the Power of Vision in Your Company and Your Life	Books	4	8	11	N	N	Praise with Reservation	Frankly, I did not know quite what to expect as I began to read this book...and then for a time, I was confused. Who is the narrator? A real person? Is this a modern parable in the recently established Movable Cheese genre? However, I continued to read, was patient, and eventually rewarded. Blanchard and Stoner have an essentially simple but urgently important concept to share: How to create and then sustain the power, indeed the urgent importance of a compelling vision. \\"It's also about how to ensure that it's a shared vision, it comes alive, and it continues to guide you on a day-to-day basis. Creating a vision statement can be just a one-time activity. This book is about how to make visioning a journey.\\" That is precisely what the authors do: They take their reader on a journey through a series of situations encountered by the narrator. This is in some respects a contemporary version of Bunyan's allegory, The Pilgrim's Progress. The narrative also contains many of the elements of a parable even as the situations portrayed are ones with which today's executives can easily identify. In the Epilogue, the narrator observes that \\"I've discovered that as we move full steam ahead toward our vision, our vision expands the closer we come to it. My vision has expanded to include my community. I've realized that on this planet, we are all part of one community, and we all need to assume responsibility for creating a shared vision.\\" I am still uncertain as to how much of the narrative expresses the thoughts and feelings of Blanchard and Stoner themselves, and, to what extent they are uniquely those of the narrator (granted, a persona, a literary device). Thus exists a certain tension of ambiguity which, for me, is a distraction. Perhaps I don't get it. In fairness to the authors, I will re-read the book. For now, I rate it as I have. If a careful re-reading clarifies what is for now, for me, unclear, I will revise this review and adjust the rating accordingly.	2003-06-16

I have also read other biographies of Franklin, as well as of Washington, Jefferson, and Adams; also, accounts of their era, notably Ellis' Founding Brothers, Ferling's Setting the World Ablaze, and Bailyn's To Begin the World Anew. In my opinion, Morgan provides in this volume the single best source of information to answer questions such as these: \\"Which of Franklin's experiences as a child and young man had the greatest influence on his development? How to explain his insatiable curiosity? What was he like as a husband and father? Why was he so reluctant to draw public attention to himself? Given the times, was he a legitimate scientist or merely a clever tinkerer? What were his unique contributions to the creation, establishment, and development of a new nation? Why was he so popular in Europe, especially in France? As his death drew near, what was Franklin's own estimate of his achievements?\\" Morgan offers answers to these and other questions.<br />It is indicative of Morgan's erudition as well as his writing skills his narrative seems as if it were an eyewitness account such as James Boswell's of Samuel Johnson. There are hundreds of anecdotes included, many of them previously unfamiliar to most readers. Morgan also makes generous but appropriate use of Franklin's own written works as well as of sources contemporary with him. In the final chapter, however, Morgan quotes one of Franklin's best-known maxims, \\"let all men know thee, but no man know thee thoroughly.\\" Franklin's actions always spoke much louder than his words. Indeed, he was renowned for his silence in the Pennsylvania Assembly, in the Continental Congress, in the Constitutional Convention, and throughout countless meetings with government officials in England and France.<br />Lest we misunderstand what motivated this pattern of silence, Morgan observes that Franklin \\"knew how to value himself and what he did without mistaking himself for something more than one man among many. His special brand of self-respect required him to honor his fellow men and women no less than himself.\\" I was intrigued by Morgan's account of what seems to be an essential contradiction in Franklin: his self-confidence and his humility. Franklin was guided by a spirit which can never be confined to any one religious denomination. He recognized strengths and weaknesses in himself as well as in others, \\"in a spirit that another wise man in another century called 'the spirit which is not too sure it is right.' It is a spirit which weakens the weak but strengthens the strong. It gave Franklin the strength to do what he incredibly did, as a scientist, statesman, and man.\\" In this context, I am reminded of Voltaire's advice that we should cherish those who seek the truth but beware of those who find it.<br />Although we will never know Franklin \\"thoroughly,\\" Morgan has helped us to know him well.what motivated this pattern of silence, Morgan observes that Franklin \\"knew how to value himself and what he did without mistaking himself for something more than one man among many.

It gave Franklin the strength to do what he incredibly did, as a scientist, statesman, and man.\\" In this context, I am reminded of Voltaire's advice that we should cherish those who seek the truth but beware of those who find it. <br />Although we will never know Franklin \\"thoroughly,\\" Morgan has helped us to know him well.	2003-06-13

The Five Star rating correctly indicates my high regard for what Barabasi has accomplished as he attempts to help his reader to think in terms of networks in new and different (probably unfamiliar) ways. His book \\"is about how networks emerge, what they look like, and how they evolve.\\" With meticulous care, he presents \\"a Web-based view of nature, society, and business, a new framework for understanding issues ranging from democracy on the Web to vulnerability of the Internet and the spread of deadly viruses.\\" Along the way, Barabasi challenges the concept of \\"The Random Universe,\\" asserting instead that everything is connected to everything else. He devotes most of his book to explaining the significance of that global interconnectedness to business, science, and everyday life.<br />As a non-scientist, I am unqualified to comment on much of the material which Barabasi shares. Perhaps he wrote this book for non-scientists such as I who nonetheless struggle to understand what Barabasi characterizes as the \\"mystery of life\\" which begins with the intricate web of interactions and thereby integrates the millions of molecules within each organism. \\"The enigma of the society starts with the convoluted structure of the social network....[For that reason] networks are the prerequisite for describing any complex system, indicating that complexity theory must inevitably stand on the shoulders of network theory. It is tempting to step in the footsteps of some of my predecessors and predict whether and when we will tame complexity.\\" Given all that has been accomplished thus far with regard to disentangling the networks following the discovery of scale-free networks, Barabasi concludes, \\"Once we stumble across the right vision of complexity, it will take little to bring it to fruition. When [in italics] that will happen is one of the mysteries that keeps many of us going.\\"<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Mark Buchanan's Nexus: Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking Science of Networks, Stanley Kaufman's At Home in the Universe: The Search for Laws of Self-Organization and Complexity as well as The Origins of Order: Self-Organization and Selection in Evolution, Steven Strogatz' Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order, Duncan J. Watts' Six Degrees: the Science of a Connected Age, and Stephen Wolfram's A New Kind of Science.<br />I probably should add Ed Regis' The Info Mesa: Science, Business, and the New Alchemy on the Santa Fe Plateau. Regis devotes almost all of his attention to individuals and events who and which, over several decades, had a profound impact on essentially the same subjects as those discussed in the books previously recommended. Also, Regis examines in much greater detail than do the other authors how core concepts about networks and their complexity were introduced to the commercial marketplace by various entrepreneurs.f the mysteries that keeps many of us going.\\"<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Mark Buchanan's Nexus: Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking Science of Networks, Stanley Kaufman's At Home in the Universe: The Search for Laws of Self-Organization and Complexity as well as The Origins of Order: Self-Organization and Selection in Evolution, Steven Strogatz' Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order, Duncan J.

Those already familiar with the highly acclaimed television series, E.R., no doubt recall especially dramatic portrayals of (quite literally) life-or-death crises. Members of real-world emergency room staffs confirm such moments really can and often do occur. They will also tell you about extended periods when there are few (if any) persons in need of medical care. In this context, I am reminded of fire departments where hours of boredom are interrupted by sudden emergencies. Most of the time, most organizations seem to function crisis-free until....<br />What Friedman has written is a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective response to this important question: Which resources, strategies, and tactics are essential to prepare for, cope with and then learn from a crisis?<br />There are other excellent books on the same general subject. For example, Blythe's Blindsided, Fink's Crisis Management, Lukaszewski's First Response, Myers' Manager's Guide to Contingency Planning for Disasters, and Harvard Business Review on Crisis Management. Most of them tend to focus on crises in major corporations. In addition to its value for such large enterprises, Friedman's book will be extremely valuable to family-owned businesses, smaller organizations, and individuals. A loss of power or a fire in a department store certainly qualifies as a crisis but corporate resources ensure financial recovery of the given location. That is not always true if a family-owned business were to encounter the same crisis even if it were sufficiently insured. The loss of day-to-day revenue could be fatal.<br />I also think Friedman's book will be highly beneficial to decision-makers in small-to-midsize companies which provide products and services to a major enterprise such as an airline, large office building or automobile manufacturer. Crisis management for clients who depend on us may be even more important than crisis management for our own organization. In fact, I think all such initiatives should be coordinated, indeed integrated, within a program guided and informed by Friedman's book. As he observes, each component of any crisis management program requires appropriate answers to the same two questions: \\"What if?\\" and \\"Then what?\\"<br />The Chinese character for the word \\"crisis\\" has two different meanings: peril and opportunity. As Friedman quite correctly suggests,  crisis management worthy of the name must accommodate both.or automobile manufacturer.

In essence, this is what LaSalle and Britton have in mind when explaining in their brilliant book how to turn ?ordinary products into extraordinary experiences? for consumers. They organize their material within two separate but related sections: in the first, they examine the interaction of customers, value, and experience; in the second, they explain how almost any company can prosper in what James H. Gilmore and  B. Joseph Pine II characterize as ?the experience economy,? in their book so entitled. But HOW? By offering a product or service which, according to LaSalle and Britton, fills a consumer?s need for freedom, adventure, and a sense of well-being. My own rather extensive background includes market research on what consumers value most. Those surveyed ranked ?feeling appreciated,? ETDBW (i.e. easy to do business with), and enjoying the experience were ranked highest. Those responses are consistent with what LaSalle and Britton have learned. What astonishes me (and perhaps them as well) is that only recently has the importance of sensory experience been recognized, relative to purchase decisions and to consumer perceptions of those from whom their purchases are made.<br />Bernd Schmitt and Alex Simonson?s Experiential Marketing: How to Get Customers to Sense, Feel,, Think, Act, and Relate to Your Company and Brands was first published in 1999. In it, they examine a number of different companies (e.g. Nokia, Procter &amp; Gamble, Apple Computer, Volkswagen, Siemens, Martha Stewart Living, and SONY) which demonstrate the fundamental principles of what they call ?experiential marketing.? They were praised as pioneer thinkers (which I certainly do not dispute) when, in Part Two of their book, they focus on what they call Strategic Experiential Modules (SEMs), each of which has its own distinct structures and principles which must be understood by each manager. SEMs include sensory experiences (SENSE), affective experiences (FEEL), creative cognitive experiences (THINK), physical experiences and entire lifestyles (ACT), and social-identity experiences (RELATE). Schmitt and examine each, explaining how to achieve the effective integration of all four.<br />LaSalle and Britton share my high regard for Gilmore and Pine as well as for Schmitt and Simonson (among others) but break critically important new ground in Priceless by providing a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system by which almost any company can increase and enhance the appeal of almost any product or service. More specifically, LaSalle and Britton identify and then explain a series of interdependent components throughout Chapters 1-6 which comprise what they call the ?Priceless Roadmap.? By the end of their book, they have enabled their reader to understand the relationship between value and experience (including emotional as well as sensory experience) by showing the link between them and customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, and (most preferable of all) customer evangelism. They trace the series of events which a customer experiences during the consumption process. Most important of all, with precision and clarity, they demonstrate how a company can deliver value through experience by focusing on three key attributes: product, service, and environment.<br />It would be a mistake to assume that this book was written primarily (if not exclusively) for marketing executives. Every value, principle, strategy, and tactic which LaSalle and Britton examine is directly relevant, for example, to increasing and enhancing the appeal of any workplace and to strengthening relationships between and among those within it. I also think this book will be of substantial value to senior-level executives as they embark on mid-range and long-term planning (i.e. up to 36 months at the most) because organizations as well as consumer products and services, and indeed individuals, can achieve greatness only if guided and informed by a ?Priceless Roadmap? in one form or another.ndeed individuals, can achieve greatness only if guided and informed by a ?Priceless Roadmap? in one form or another.	2003-06-10

In this volume, he focuses on \\"how to make any Web site better.\\" His dual metaphors explain the meaning and significance of the title. Preferring a marketer's version of a Web site to that of an engineer, he suggests that \\"One of the best ways to remind yourself about what's really going on [when someone visits a Web site] is to think of a monkey in a big red fez...The best way to motivate the monkey [to take a desired action], of course, is to use a banana. Whenever a monkey walks into a new situation, all it wants to know is, 'Where's the banana?' If the banana isn't easy to see, easy to get and obvious, the monkey is going to lose interest. But if you can make it clear to the monkey what's in it for him, odds are he'll do what you want.\\" Obviously, the monkey is the Web site visitor and the banana is the incentive mechanism.<br />Godin uses a number of different real-world Web sites to illustrate what is and is not effective; he also explains why. (Presumably many of those responsible for the ineffective Web sites have read this book and made the necessary revisions since it first appeared about 18 months ago.) One of the book's most interesting points concerns the quite different mentalities of the engineer and the marketer. The former assumes that smart people have plenty of time, know precisely what they want from their online surfing, and can make a considered decision if provided with sufficient data. In stunning contrast, the marketer assumes that people are busy, ill informed, impatient, not very thoughtful and eager to click on to something RIGHT NOW. The marketer also believes that if you don't give the visitor the right object (or objective) to click on to immediately, the visitor will hit the \\"Back\\" button and leave.<br />I presume to add another difference: I think that most visually complicated Web sites resemble the front page of the U.S.A. Today newspaper (especially the Friday/Saturday/Sunday edition) whereas the most effective Web sites resemble the most effective billboards along a highway. Percentages vary but research studies suggest that online surfers spend about 90% of their time visiting the same ten Web sites Also, that after a unsatisfying experience, the percentage is even higher; that is, approximately 95% of online surfers never return to that Web site.<br />One substantial benefit this book provides which I did not anticipate when I began to read it is that the same principles which Godin recommends to increase a Web site's effectiveness are also relevant to the design of marketing and sales collateral materials such as direct mail solicitations and printed brochures. Because of the immense clutter through which messages of various kinds struggle to reach their destination, and because this clutter is certain to become even greater, Godin's concept of what he calls a \\"purple cow\\" (explained in a book of the same name) has compelling importance: become and then remain remarkable for as long as possible. Web sites, letterhead, business cards, products, services...indeed contact and communication in any form...must attract and reward attention or are certain to fail.

Also be alert to various lists of award-winning Web sites, especially those selected by online surfers rather than by technicians.

I make it a point to re-read both at least once a year; also Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography. My guess (only a guess) is that these three books have also had a positive and lasting impact on Brian Tracy. Their influence is suggested in this book as are the Four Gospels and Saint Paul's various Letters in the New Testament.<br />However, we all realize that each of us must assume full responsibility for our successes and failures in life. The most valuable lessons we learn are from our own experiences, especially from failures. Tracy notes that \\"more than 90% of all financially successful people today started out broke or nearly broke. The average self-made millionaire has been bankrupt or nearly bankrupt 3.2 times.\\" Hmmm. He chose self-made millionaires as the focal point of this book \\"because these people had demonstrated social qualities and behaviors that were observable and measurable.\\" He offers 21 \\"success secrets,\\" most of which are really not secrets. I would be very surprised if any one of them is unfamiliar to anyone who reads this book.<br />For me, this is the key point: No matter what we read and how carefully we read it, now matter how much wisdom is provided by what we read, NOTHING beneficial will result unless and until we embrace appropriate values, then make decisions and take appropriate actions which are guided and informed by those values.<br />Tracy insists that success is predictable. I presume to add, that the same is true of failure. \\"Your greatest responsibility is to dream big dreams, decide exactly what you want, make a plan to achieve it, practice the strategies in this book, take action every single day in the direction of your dreams and goals, and resolve [as Churchill urges] to never, never, never give up.\\" Throughout his book, Tracy does indeed recommend specific strategies to follow and includes a series of Action Exercises to complete. In that event, \\"You become unstoppable and your success becomes inevitable.\\"<br />Hill, Carnegie, Franklin, and countless others do indeed share the credit for whatever I may have achieved in my life thus far but only I am responsible for what remains of that life.<br />It is not enough to read and admire Tracy's book. As I have previously indicated, the challenge is to embrace appropriate values, then make decisions and take appropriate actions which are guided and informed by those values. The extent to which we respond to that challenge will determine whether or not we succeed or fail when pursuing whatever our dreams may be.\\" Throughout his book, Tracy does indeed recommend specific strategies to follow and includes a series of Action Exercises to complete.

Canada could have focused on seven (out of respect to Covey) or on 14 or on 34 \\"sales traps.\\" In fact, there are hundreds of incorrect or inappropriate actions and strategies undertaken by salespeople or a sales organization because of incomplete or false information, illogical thinking, \\"tradition,\\" poor decision-making, and/or not knowing what they don't know. Canada brought to the writing of this book a wealth of real-world experience in sales and sales training. He also drew upon extensive published research (e.g. a sales research project sponsored by Xerox) as well as studies conducted by the Dartmouth Group, Ltd. and the Institute for Global Sales Studies. In the Introduction, Canada asserts that \\"It is not what sales and marketing people don't know that is most likely to significantly hurt their performance; it is what they think they know that turns out to be a partial truth, a fallacy, or a mistaken belief that affects their results more.\\"<br />According to Canada, the most successful salespeople, sales teams, and sales organizations are guided and informed by six principles: Focus outside, get the most out of the best people, train effectively, create value, offer feedback and create opportunities for learning, and use the Internet and databases effectively. He illustrates each of these six by identifying and then examining 24 different sales traps, each of which violates one or more of the principles. He then explains how to avoid them. For example:<br />Sales Trap #6: Either Sales People Have It or They Don't<br />Action Points: Be patient, Give constructive feedback, and give consistent feedback that doesn't exclude anyone.<br />Sales Truth #6: Sales people are developed [in italics], not born [also in italics]<br />Canada uses this same format for the other sales traps, devoting a separate chapter to each of the 24. He provides brief annotations with each Action Point throughout the book and also inserts observations, suggestions, and examples so as to create a context for each combination of Sales Trap/Action Points/Sales Truth. He concludes with an Epilogue in which he shares his thoughts about the next generation of performance change programs, suggesting that there are two unique points that should be carefully considered when devising a program by which to move sales performance and sales results to the next level. First, performance change programs must incorporate a customer survey that is customized for the program, and performance change programs should also examine the success factors from the customer's perspective.\\" Although Canada does not italicize the last four words, I would. \\"Second, the program must incorporate into each case study the 'best practices' of your top salespeople. In other words, we must leverage the insights of an organization's best people in order to help others within the company.\\" I could not agree more, presuming to add that the aforementioned \\"best practices\\" would also be of substantial to those not directly involved in sales (e.g. receptionists, telephone operators, CSRs, accounting) who also have direct and frequent contact with customers.<br />After reviewing the 24, many readers will probably have a few sales traps to add to the list. Perhaps if enough readers share them with Canada (he is a member of the marketing faculty at the Kelley School of Business, Indiana University), he will accumulate enough new material for another book. My own rather extensive experience in sales and sales training suggests these troublemakers:<br />MISTAKE A: Negotiating Against Yourself (i.e. assuming what a customer can and cannot afford)<br />TRUTH A: Let the customer say \\"No.\\"<br />MISTAKE B: Constantly \\"Cultivate\\" Customers<br />TRUTH B: Contact a customer only when there is a legitimate reason to do so.<br />MISTAKE C: Ask Lots of Questions<br />TRUTH C: Do your homework. Lots of it. Request only the answers you cannot be expected to know already.<br />MISTAKE D: Closing Skills Are Most Important<br />TRUTH D: More often than not, so-called \\"closing skills\\" work best when used to pre-qualify a prospect.<br />Although this book will be of great value to relatively inexperienced salespeople, especially to those without the safety nets and air cover of an established sales organization, I also think it will be of substantial value to sales managers and to peak performers who can so easily become entrapped by what Jim O'Toole refers to as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" Probably the worst sales trap of all is to continue to think and sell the same way, day after day, and then expect better results. Even the most experienced of salespeople should constantly be challenging their own assumptions, premises, etc. about sales...but seldom do. Canada's book can guide and inform such a re-evaluation.<br />Especially for organizations with limited resources and a small sales force, Canada's book can serve as the basis of an especially effective sales training program. Larger organizations can also use it as the focal point of a workshop. Obviously, those who understand what the 24 sales traps are and why they are so dangerous are most likely to avoid them.ady.<br />MISTAKE D: Closing Skills Are Most Important<br />TRUTH D: More often than not, so-called \\"closing skills\\" work best when used to pre-qualify a prospect.<br />Although this book will be of great value to relatively inexperienced salespeople, especially to those without the safety nets and air cover of an established sales organization, I also think it will be of substantial value to sales managers and to peak performers who can so easily become entrapped by what Jim O'Toole refers to as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" Probably the worst sales trap of all is to continue to think and sell the same way, day after day, and then expect better results.

This book generated a great deal of attention when it first appeared because Gladwell approaches creative thinking from a unique perspective: he focuses on a critically important moment (a \\"window of opportunity\\") when a decision must be made and explains how (a) to prepare for that moment and then (b) make a decision which is both creative and appropriate. He describes his book as \\"the biography of an idea\\", a simple idea: the best way to understand the emergence of all major social, economic, or political forces (what Kuhn and then Barker call a \\"paradigm shift\\") \\"is to think of them as epidemics. Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread just like viruses do.\\" (This is precisely what Seth Godin means when discussing his concept of an \\"ideavirus.\\") But first they must be activated, set in motion, more often than not by what Gladwell characterizes as a \\"little thing.\\" In the Conclusion of his book, he suggests: \\"Look at the world around you. It may seem like an immovable, implacable place. It is not. With the slightest push -- in just the right place -- it can be tipped.\\" He offers an abundance of examples. As I first read the book, and began to grasp this concept, I thought of Isaac Newton and his alleged encounter with a falling apple. Also of Shakespeare's Richard III who lost a kingdom because his horse lost a shoe. You get the idea. Tipping points can occur almost anywhere at any time. Most of us fail to recognize them because of what I call \\"the invisibility of the obvious.\\" They can be the result of many different factors which, in combination, can sometimes change the course of history. During the next few years, my guess is that progressively more tipping points will occur and at progressively greater velocity but that they will reveal themselves not as windows of opportunity but as blinks of a strobe light. Those who see them and know what to do about them will probably have a decisive competitive advantage, if not dominate the marketplace in which they compete. At least for a while....hich they compete. At least for a while....	2003-06-04

After studying 4,000 managers in relation to (on average) ten different jobs per manager, he arrived at a number of conclusions. They serve as the core material of this book in which he explains how both companies and individuals can gain and then hold a competitive advantage which Peter Drucker identifies as follows: \\"The ability to make good decisions regarding people represents one of the last reliable sources of competitive advantage, since very few organizations are very good at it.\\" As Smart carefully explains, topgrading is the practice of packing any team with A players and clearing out the C players. \\"A player [italics] is defined as the top 10 percent of talent available at all salary levels -- best of class. With this radical definition, you are not a topgrader until your team consists of all A players [last three words in italics]. Period.\\" Those who read this book and then apply the principles, strategies, and tactics which Smart recommends will be well-prepared to (a) hire only A players or those almost certain to become one and (b) those who are or wish to become A players and need expert guidance to achieve that objective.<br />For me, the most stunning revelations in the book are found on page 50, in Figure 3.2, \\"Cost of Miss-Hire Study Results.\\" According to the results of Smart's research study of more than 50 corporations, the sum of costs of a mis-hire (on average) are as follows:<br />Base salary Less than $100,000: 14 times salary<br />Base Salary $100,000-250,000: 28 times salary<br />All Salaries: 24 times salary<br />Now go back and re-read those statistics while keeping in mind that, for various reasons which Smart briefly explains, \\"the numbers are probably conservative.\\" Organizing his material within two Parts (one for companies, another for individuals), Smart offers a cohesive and comprehensive narrative within which he includes all manner of graphic illustrations as well as a number of exercises and questionnaires which enable both those who hire and those who are candidates to understand what topgrading is, what the CIDS interview approach is and how to derive the greatest benefits from it.<br />Most important of all), Smart explains how to achieve what Jim Collins describes so well in his most recently published book: the good to companies &quot;...first got the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and the right people in the right seats -- and then they figured out where to drive it. The old adage 'People are the most important asset' turned out to be wrong. People are not [italics] your most important asset. The right [italics] people are.&quot; Presumably Smart would agree that the right people share the same values and, together, sustain their organization's commitment to those values. If involved in their organization's recruiting and interviewing process, as they should be, they will help to ensure that the right people will be hired (i.e. allowed on the &quot;bus&quot;). Obviously it is important to get talent and task in proper alignment. It is equally important to keep an organization's values in proper alignment with its objective(s). Although Collins does not use the term, the good to great companies he discusses are all topgraders.<br />The reader will especially appreciate having the information provided by Smart in (count `em) seven appendices: CIDS Interview Guide, Career History Form, In-Depth Reference-Check Guide, Interview Feedback Form, Sample Competencies --  Management, and Sample Competencies -- Wm. M. Mercer. Here in a single volume is about all anyone needs to know and have inorder to understand what topgrading is, how it works, and why it will probably be essential to those who hire as well as to those whom they consider.<br />Lest there be any misunderstanding by anyone reading this review, I want to point out that any organization (regardless of size ornature) can be a topgrader and that is even more important to smaller organizations with limited resources.

I think each of them would be invaluable, not only to those entrusted with marketing responsibilities but to all other decision-makers within any organization, regardless of size of nature. For example, Jeff Fox's How to Become a Marketing Superstar and Seth Godin's Purple Cow.<br />This book is certainly outstanding but I recommend it only to those who are (a) corporate marketing managers, (b) principals, account supervisors, and account managers in advertising agencies, and (c) students enrolled in MBA programs, preferably if read in combination with Joseph Murphy's The Powers of Your Subconscious Mind. Zaltman makes significant demands on his reader as he explores with meticulous care how all people (not only customers) function both on the conscious and subconscious level. He identifies and applies a number of key terms such as cognitive unconscious, metaphor elicitation, response latency, and neuroimagining. He explains the Metaphor-Elicitation process, how to use a Consensus Map, and memory's \\"fragile power.\\" For me, some of the most interesting and most valuable material is provided in Chapter Nine (\\"Memory, Metaphor, and Stories\\") and Chapter Ten (\\"Stories and Brands\\"), in part because I am especially interested in organizational symbols, rituals, and traditions. Zaltman shifts his and his reader's attention to \\"Crowbars for Creative Thinking\\" (a terrific chapter title) following by the final two chapters in which he (somehow) reviews and then integrates all of his key concepts while explaining how and why \\"Quality Questions Beget Quality Answers\\" and how to launch a \\"New Mind-Set.\\"<br />I hope you have noted my frequent use of \\"how to\\" while briefly reviewing the range of subjects embraced by Zaltman's own intellect as he takes a \\"frank\\" look at the state of marketing today, introduces and analyses a \\"new paradigm\\" through examples of \\"how companies today apply the paradigm's principles, with remarkable results,\\" and (in Part III) expands the perspective beyond customers' and consumers' thinking. Specifically, Zaltman shows managers ten ways to \\"break out of the box\\" when thinking about consumers and marketing -- and how they can help their colleagues to do the same. In Chapter 12, he suggests that new ways of thinking begin with better ways of asking questions and offers eight guidelines. Then in Chapter 13, Zaltman offers a word of caution about regressing into \\"business as usual\\" attitudes and practices, to what Jim O'Toole has characterized as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" Zaltman views his book as a \\"starting point\\" for better representing (and understanding) the \\"mind of the market,\\" which is to say both the conscious and subconscious mind of the given customer or consumer.<br />Zaltman's reference to a \\"starting point\\" can be interpreted in quite different ways. Some may conclude that he is suggesting that his book offers an appropriate \\"starting point\\" for those in need of books about marketing. In m y opinion, that is not his intention. (My own recommendations would be Theodore Levitt's The Marketing Imagination, Ries and Trout's Positioning, and Harvard Business Review on Marketing. After a careful reading of those two volumes, Zaltman's book will be much more accessible.) Rather, I think Zaltman's use of the term \\"starting point\\" has quite a different purpose: To suggest (and I agree) that mankind's efforts to understand what the mind is, how it works, etc. have only just begun...especially with regard to efforts to understand how and why customers think. Our \\"voyage from the familiar\\" has only begun.<br />This is one of several books I felt obliged to re-read at least once before attempting to formulate a review of it. (Others include Edelman's Bright Air, Brilliant Fire and Pinker's How the Mind Works.) Earlier, I suggested thatthis brilliant but challenging book would be of greatest value to those who are (a) corporate marketing managers, (b) principals, account supervisors, and account managers in advertising agencies, and (c) students enrolled in MBA programs. I'll go with that, taking this opportunity to thank Gerald Zaltman for a uniquely thought-provoking as well as informative intellectual experience. How well I apply what I think I have learned from him has yet to be determined.

As I read Bruck's holograph (it's more than a portrait) of Lew Wasserman, I was reminded of that observation. According to her account, Wasserman had a special talent for achieving his objectives while preserving cordial relationships with a wide and diverse range of potential antagonists. For example, with the heads of various studios with whom he aggressively negotiated on behalf of MCA's clients; with James Hoffa from whose union Wasserman hired 15,000 members; and with other talent agents after MCA became a major producer of films and television programs. As I completed reading this book, I felt gratitude for the brilliant presentation of the material about Wasserman but I was also favorably impressed by Bruck's demonstration of skills which we normally associate with a cultural anthropologist. As we all know, \\"Hollywood\\" is far less significant (if significant at all) as a place than it is as a state-of-mind. Bruck appropriately establishes Wasserman as the gravitational center of her book but she also probes deeply into basic sources of power and influence within the evolving culture of the entertainment industry, sources which remain long after Wasserman was no longer actively involved. For me, the entertainment value of Bruck's book is derived much less from the glitz and glamor of stardom of &quot;Tinseltown&quot; than it does from her examination of all manner of business issues, relationships, and conflicts. It is impossible to understand who Wasserman was and to appreciate what he achieved without correlating his personality and career with the history, economics, art, politics, and psychology of the empire over which he reigned for so many years. Bruck makes such correlations with consummate precision while preserving, throughout her examination of Wasserman  (\\"a shark you almost had to admire as he circled you\\") the nuances of his multi-dimensional humanity.mensional humanity.	2003-06-04

Ah, but that first impression is soon proven false by what indeed is a fascinating, at times riveting (albeit brief) history of what Micklethwait and Wooldridge correctly suggest has been and remains, since the Companies Act of 1862, \\"the basis of the prosperity of the West and the best hope for the future of the world.\\" Soon becoming the single most powerful economic power, the limited-liability joint-stock company combined the three big ideas behind the modern company: \\"that it could be an artificial person,\\" with the same ability to do business as a real person; that it could issue tradable shares to any number of investors; and that those investors could have limited liability (so they could lose only the money they had committed to the firm).\\"<br />Although Micklethwait and Wooldridge do indeed provide \\"a short history of a revolutionary idea,\\" their book is remarkably comprehensive as it traces the evolution of commercial structure from merchants and monopolists (3000 B.C. -- 1500) through imperialists and speculators (1500-1750) and the \\"prolonged and painful birth\\" of the limited-liability joint-stock company (1750-1862) before shifting their and the reader's attention to the rise of big business in America (1862-1913), the rise of big business in Britain, Germany, and Japan (1850-1950), the triumph of managerial capitalism (1913-1975), and what they characterize as \\"the corporate paradox\\" (1975-2002) before examining \\"agents of influence: multinationals (1850-2002) in the final chapter. All this, and done very well indeed, in less than 200 pages!

Creating and Capitalizing on the Best New Management Thinking	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Certain to Become a Business &quot;Classic&quot;	Within a few hours of reading this latest book co-authored by Davenport and Prusak with H. James Wilson, I went into a meeting with the senior managers of one of my consulting clients. The only item on the agenda was the perceived need for generating more suggestions from among the company's 575 employees. More specifically, suggestions as to how to produce more and better work in less time and thereby lower operating costs while increasing productivity and improving efficiency. (Sound familiar?) Still absorbing Davenport and Prusak's information and (especially) insights, I posed for the group a series of questions:<br />1. Is this company idea-driven?<br />2. Are workers encouraged to suggest new/better ideas?<br />3. Are they convinced each suggestion will be carefully considered?<br />4. Are the best ideas then recognized and rewarded?<br />5. Are those suggestions then acted upon in a timely manner?<br />Long pause. Silence. The senior managers resembled what Darrell Royal once described as \\"a young goat staring at a new gate.\\" Clearing of throats. Finally, the CEO asked \\"Well, what about it?\\" Finally, those in the group admitted that the answer to all of the was the same: sometimes. Translation: Seldom.<br />In Working Knowledge (1997), Davenport and Prusak explain how organizations manage what they know. In The Good Company (2001), Cohen and Prusak explain how social capital makes organizations work. In this volume, Davenport and Prusak explain how to create and capitalize on the best management thinking. However, any business idea (no matter how BIG it may seem to some) is essentially worthless unless and until it contributes to business success. In this volume, they focus on \\"idea practitioners\\" and \\"gurus.\\" The former are those within an organization who assess and translate and develop new ideas to bring into the organization and subsequently fight for them. The latter are \\"boundary spanners\\" who work with rather than within an organization, sharing what they have learned from their exposure to both theory and practice-oriented ideas as they interact with companies (\\"the primary source of their ideas\\"), think and write (analyses for clients as well as articles and books for publication), and present their ideas at meetings and conferences (thereby attracting attention and new clients as well as earning substantial appearance fees). Davenport and Prusak examine the work of several dozen \\"idea practitioners\\" and \\"gurus.\\" In Appendix C, they rank \\"The Top Two Hundred Business Gurus,\\" with the top five being Michael Porter, Tom Peters, Robert Reich, Peter Drucker, and Gary Becker.<br />Carefully organizing their material within nine chapters, Davenport and Prusak explain how ideas are linked to business success, who introduces ideas to organizations and how they do that, why \\"content counts,\\" where the best management ideas come from, how ideas interact with markets, where to find ideas most appropriate to a given organization and then how to sell them, and why idea-based leadership is essential to any organization's success. I've already mentioned Appendix C. The other two, Appendices A and B, provide \\"A Select Survey of Business and Management Ideas\\" and \\"The Idea Practitioners.\\"<br />To the best of my knowledge, this is the first single volume in which cutting-edge thinking about intellectual capital, social capital, creative business thinking, process simplification/improvement, knowledge management, and idea leadership is not only combined but correlated and indeed integrated into what can be (with certain modifications) a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system for generating the best ideas and then effectively putting them into practice.<br />At the outset of the review, I presumed to include the five questions posed to the senior managers. After re-reading this book, I am even more convinced that these are questions which decision-makers must ask inorder to determine the extent to which their organization is not only receptive to new and better ideas but wholeheartedly determined to generate or adopt and then implement them. Davenport and Prusak are dead on: There must be an Idea Strategy. More importantly, there must be an Idea-Friendly Culture which has (a) open dialogue between and among ALL levels, (b) what Jack Welch calls \\"boundarylessness\\" which maximizes individual and collective intellect from both within and outside the organization, and finally, (c) trust and responsibility which will, Davenport and Prusak assert, \\"allow people to learn effectively from each other and provide motivation for putting ideas to work.\\"<br />This book is certain to become a business \\"classic.\\"zation is not only receptive to new and better ideas but wholeheartedly determined to generate or adopt and then implement them.

In this latest of his several thought-provoking books, he suggests all manner of strategies and tactics by which to transform both organizations and their products and services into what is uniquely and compellingly \\"remarkable.\\" In a phrase, a \\"Purple Cow.\\" When he and his family drove out of Paris into the countryside, extending their vacation travel into lovely rural areas, they were immediately entranced by \\"the hundreds of storybook cows grazing on picturesque pastures right next to the highway.\\" However, after proceeding dozens of kilometers, they began to ignore the cows because, although they may be \\"perfect cows, attractive cows, cows with great personalities,\\" they had become boring. \\"A Purple Cow, though. Now that [in italics] would be interesting. (For a while.)\\" You get the idea. The challenge for any organization is to differentiate itself -- and whatever it offers for sale -- in ways and to an extent that ensure that it becomes (and remains for a while at least) remarkable. In essence, that is what this book is all about: the why, what, and how of achieving that elusive but critically important objective.<br />Although this book will probably be of greatest value to those entrusted with responsibility for marketing, its relevance extends to (literally) all decision-makers in all organizations (regardless of size or nature) who are determined, indeed obsessed to free themselves from what Jim O'Toole characterizes as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" Throughout his book, Godin asks direct questions which challenge his reader to challenge her or his core assumptions, premises, etc. \\"You don't need passion to create a Purple Cow. Nor do you need an awful lot of creativity. What you need is the insight to realize that you have no other choice but to grow your business or launch your product with Purple Cow thinking. [What follows is in italics.] Nothing else is going to work.\\" Presumably Godin agrees with Robert Kriegel that sacred cows make the best burgers. Presumably he also agrees with me that any Purple Cow remains remarkable only for a while. Then what? A plaid kangaroo? A polka dot hamster? Whatever the metaphor, the fact remains that whatever one offers for sale must be perceived as remarkable but also BE remarkable in that it offers unique substance, value, features, benefits, etc. When that is no longer true, even a brilliant thinker such as Godin cannot save it from its inevitable fate.ct with Purple Cow thinking.

What? Another book about Sam Walton? Actually, as the subtitle of Slater's book correctly indicates, he focuses most of his (and the reader's) attention on \\"How the Generation of Leaders Turned Sam Walton's Legacy into the World's #1 Company.?\\" To the best of my knowledge, that is a story that hasn't been told until now. Slater begins by examining Wal-Mart today and allocates only three of 14 chapters to \\"The Founder and His legacy,\\" devoting the remainder of his book to explaining how the new management team devised and then implemented  strategies for rapid but prudent growth. After a decade, those strategies have enabled Wal-Mart to become (in 2003) the first company ever to head both the Fortune 500 list of American companies and that magazine's list of Most Admired Companies.<br />There really have been three quite different periods of Wal-Mart's development from a Ben Franklin franchise (opened in Bentonville as the Walton 5 and 10 in March of 1951) to the global retailing giant it is today. First, the Sam Walton Years until his death in 1992, the David Glass Years (1992-2000), and the Lee Scott Years 2000-Present). However, as Slater carefully explains, it would be a disservice to Glass and Scott as well as to their associates to exaggerate the importance of CEO during \\"The Wal-Mart Decade.\\"<br />Devised and constantly nourished by Sam Walton, the company has always had a culture based on Three Basic Beliefs: 1) respect for the individual; 2) service to the customers; and 3) striving for excellence. Walton was also totally committed to what he characterized as his Ten Rules of Business. He had serious reservations about rapid and substantial growth (especially internationally) and was reluctant to make the capital investments which modern technology required. He wanted everyone within the company culture to follow the Ten Rules, managing and growing the company \\"one store at a time.\\"<br />During Walton's lingering illness and following his death, Glass and then Scott reaffirmed their quite sincere commitment to preserving the Wal-Mart culture and its values, and, to following the founder's Ten Rules of Business. However, neither that culture and its values nor those rules precluded the growth achieved under Glass's leadership and technological/logistical superiority achieved under Scott's leadership. To me, one of the the most interesting developments throughout the past decade has been the gradual but increasing resentment of Wal-Mart among competitors, suppliers, customers, business media, and even some employees. (That resentment is also obvious in some of the other Customer Reviews of this book.) Slater carefully examines several of the reasons (several of them justified) and how Wal-Mart responded, at least up to the completion of this book's manuscript. \\"In case anyone had had any doubts,\\" Slater observes, \\"it was now [on February 18, 2003] clear to all Wal-Mart managers that the company had become fully engaged in a broader mission. In addition to being the best retailer in the world, Wal-Mart now felt it must be equally dedicated to becoming the best possible employer and best possible local citizen.\\"<br />For years, many people asked about Wal-Mart the same question that others asked about Southwest Airlines: \\"What?s going to happen after HE leaves?? With all due respect to both Sam Walton and Herb Kelleher, two men whom it has been my great pleasure to meet, their respective organizations have done just fine. Perhaps that is the ultimate test of leadership: a heritage which endures after the leader is either gone or much less involved. In this exceptionally informative book, Slater explains how and why such a heritage guides and inspires the entire Wal-Mart organization.<br />There are still moments when, if you listen very carefully, you can almost hear Sam Walton's voice issuing his call-to-arms, \\"Give me a squiggly!\\" No matter how global and technologically advanced Wal-Mart may become, that voice will always be heard...and the \\"troops\\" will always respond. The spirit of Sam Walton is indeed alive and well.lways be heard...and the \\"troops\\" will always respond. The spirit of Sam Walton is indeed alive and well.	2003-05-30
1108781:US	51147790	R2HAOJ3SCSJCCC	1576751678	578761329	The Ultimate Competitive Advantage: Secrets of Continually Developing a More Profitable Business Model	Books	5	3	3	N	N	The ROI of Ability and Integrity	This is the latest of three business books co-authored by Don Mitchell and Carol Coles. In my opinion, none offers \\"cutting edge thinking\\" but each provides an abundance of valuable information, thoughtful analysis, and practical (i.e. doable) recommendations which are directly, indeed urgently relevant to any organization, regardless of its size, nature or current circumstances. In this volume, as he and Coles suggest, the message is \\"to develop and implement a superior management process that continually improves an organization's business model -- its ways of serving customers and outperforming competitors -- as well as fairly and appropriately rewarding all stakeholders.\\" That message is delivered with both precision and eloquence. After an exceptionally thoughtful and well-written Prologue, Mitchell and Coles carefully organize their material within four Parts: The Most Productive Areas for Business Model Innovation, [How to] Provide Substantial Benefits for All Stakeholders, [How to] Expand Business Model Innovation, and finally, [How to] Pursue Higher-Potential Business Model Improvement. I have presumed to add the [How to] prefixes because Mitchell and Coles attach so much importance to execution, obviously agreeing with Bossidy and Charan (among others) that the success or failure of any organization is ultimately determined by its performance. As the Yoda insists, \\"Do or do not. There is no try.\\"<br />Frankly, I am amazed by the number of companies which either have no business model or have one which is wholly inappropriate to their resources and objectives. For those companies, Part One all by itself is worth far more than the cost of this book.  However, it is absolutely essential to understand that even the best (i.e. most appropriate) business model is necessarily a work in progress. Hence the importance of what Mitchell and Coles characterize as \\"business model innovation.\\" By avoiding business model obsolescence, an organization can sustain what is more often than not a decisive competitive advantage. Mitchell and Coles direct their reader's attention to more than on hundred real-world examples of business model innovation. They also include a number of examples of \\"bad\\" business models whose worst deficiency is the fact that scarce resources are rapidly drained, thereby severely damaging both current and future performance. They explain both how to avoid such a model and how to repair (perhaps even replace) it.<br />Obviously, Mitchell and Coles cannot meet with each reader and conduct a rigorous and comprehensive interrogation. They include a \\"Key Questions\\" section (with each question followed by a brief discussion) at the end of each chapter. For example, here are the first three from the cluster at the end of Chapter 4, Further Improve Your Business Model and Build a Buffer for Lean Times:<br />* Do you feel inspired by your company's current business model?<br />* Does your company's business model provide greater economic and nonmonetary benefits for all stakeholders than the alternative of not doing business with your company?<br />* What could have to change for economic and nonmonetary stakeholders' benefits to double?<br />I strongly recommend that all of the \\"Key Questions\\" and (especially) previously formulated answers to them be carefully reviewed at least quarterly but preferably at least once a month.<br />It may be of interest to those who read this review to read a brief excerpt in which Mitchell and Coles invoke two metaphors, one of a forced march (i.e. rapid and unsustainable growth) and the other of a pond whose surface eventually becomes covered by water lillies. (pages 267-268) \\"A business model innovation that enlarges and improves your competitive environment, your pond of opportunity, while adding competitive advantages can expand your unencumbered potential. Then your growth can continue rapidly to a much larger size. Always look to expand your opportunities to locate and follow unimpeded pathways to progress by simplifying your tasks and inexpensively testing more competitively advantaged ways to improve the stakeholder environment.\\"<br />Earlier in this review, I was not damning with faint praise when commending Mitchell and Coles on the practicality of their books while suggesting that they do not provide cutting-edge thinking. The best ideas need landing gear and brakes as well as wings. In this volume, Mitchell and Coles are wholly preoccupied with helping their reader to execute effectively those strategies and tactics which will nourish and sustain business model innovation. They conclude their book by identifying and then briefly discussing five principles by which to build a healthy and productive life as well as a principled and profitable organization: 1) Serve more people with what they will perceive as improved performance, more rapidly and in more ways with fewer resources, 2) Make each thought and activity apply to people and their purposes who are not now being served, 3) Involve more people when considering each thought and activity, 4) Start each morning with the thought that you are beginning a company, and 5) Strengthen your stakeholders' commitment to these principles.<br />Idealistic or even corny as it may sound, impeccable character in combination high levels of energy and enthusiasm, guided by intelligence and informed by experience, really do offer the ultimate competitive advantage, whatever the human enterprise may be.mpeded pathways to progress by simplifying your tasks and inexpensively testing more competitively advantaged ways to improve the stakeholder environment.\\"<br />Earlier in this review, I was not damning with faint praise when commending Mitchell and Coles on the practicality of their books while suggesting that they do not provide cutting-edge thinking.

For example, Jim Collins' Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies and especially Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...and Others Don't. In  fact, I wish I had read Sull's book before reading Sydney Finkelstein's Why Smart Executives Fail: And What You Can Learn from Their Mistakes, Michael Craig's The 50 Worst (and Best) Business Deals of All Time, and Robert Sobel's When Giants Stumble: Classic Business Blunders and How to Avoid Them.<br />According to Sull, managers make commitments which fall within three categories: commitments to strategic frames, resources, processes, relationships, and values  which define an organization (e.g. Wal-Mart), commitments such as those to budget agreements, job assignments, customer guarantees, and investments which reinforce an organization (e.g. Southwest Airlines), and commitments required by shifts in the competitive marketplace which transform an organization (e.g. IBM).<br />Here's where it gets interesting. After years of rigorous and extensive research, Sull learned that commitments can be \\"double-edged swords\\" in that they can provide a sustainable competitive advantage as well as organizational benefits as when a pledge to achieve a given goal backed up with action creates and mobilizes energy among employees and induces them to persevere even when the outcome is uncertain. However, commitments can also limit an organization's flexibility in the present. \\"By focusing on one way of developing new products, for example, a company may excel at innovation in one domain but become less competent in other technologies.\\"<br />Sull examines dozens of companies in which original (defining) commitments had been reaffirmed (thereby sustained) despite internal as well as external developments which rendered such commitments obsolete and even counter-productive, if not destructive. Both Firestone and Goodyear were caught in what Sull calls \\"The Active Inertia Trap.\\" Goodyear escaped because its managers made commitments which transformed the organization; Firestone's managers did not. Nor did the managers at other previously great companies such as Digital Equipment organization, Data General, and Wang Laboratories. Although IBM encountered many of the same challenges as did they in its own competitive marketplace, Louis Gerstner and his associates made certain commitments which transformed their company.<br />For various reasons indicated, Sull has made a substantial and unique contribution to our understanding of corporate and managerial failure but also to our understanding of how some managers in some organizations effectively used one of the \\"sword's\\" edges to cut through what Jim O'Toole has characterized as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom\\" and thereby freed those organizations from \\"The Active Inertia Trap.\\"ternal as well as external developments which rendered such commitments obsolete and even counter-productive, if not destructive.

Although IBM encountered many of the same challenges as did they in its own competitive marketplace, Louis Gerstner and his associates made certain commitments which transformed their company.<br />For various reasons indicated, Sull has made a substantial and unique contribution to our understanding of corporate and managerial failure but also to our understanding of how some managers in some organizations effectively used one of the \\"sword's\\" edges to cut through what Jim O'Toole has characterized as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom\\" and thereby freed those organizations from \\"The Active Inertia Trap.\\"	2003-05-26

That is to say, supervisors are often unaware of the fact that they are \\"complicit in an employee's lack of success. How? By creating and reinforcing a dynamic that essentially sets up perceived weaker performers to fail.\\" Hence the title of Manzoni and Barsoux's book. The authors explain the causes and effects of that \\"dynamic\\" (see \\"Set-Up-to-Fail Syndrome,\\" Chapter 3) and also explain how to avoid it (\\"Preventing the Set-Up-to-Fail Syndrome: Lessons from the Syndrome Busters,\\" Chapter 9). One of this book's most valuable contributions is comprised of a series of \\"Tables\\" which organize and summarize key points. For example:<br />Table 2-1: \\"How Bosses See Their Behavior toward Subordinates\\" which contrasts tendencies of bosses in relationships with weaker and stronger performers.<br />Table 5-1: \\"Taking Sides\\" which presents two views of the same supervisor's observed behavior either as a \\"great boss\\" or as an \\"impossible boss.\\"<br />Table 7-2: \\"Taking Responsibility Away from an Employee\\" which juxtaposes a supervisor's thoughts and feelings about a subordinate with their interaction in dialogue.<br />Manzoni and Barsoux assert that the set-up-to-fail syndrome is \\"both self-fulfilling and self-reinforcing, which obscures the boss's responsibility in the process as well as some of the key psychological and social mechanisms involved.\\" My own experience suggests an often great discrepancy exists between modes of behavior determined by conscious and unconscious mindsets. That is to say, many supervisors would vehemently deny that they are \\"complicit in an employee's lack of success....[by] creating and reinforcing a dynamic that essentially sets up perceived weaker performers to fail.\\" Nonetheless they are. Were they to read this book, they would probably agree that there is such a syndrome and then lament how unfair it is to subordinates who are victimized by it.<br />One final point. Countless research studies of face-to-face communication have arrived at essentially the same conclusion: Body language creates 60-75% of the impact, tone of voice 15-20%, and content (i.e. what is actually said) only 10-15%. (Percentages vary among research studies but only slightly.) With the publication of this book, Manzoni and Barsoux have made a substantial contribution to our understanding of a widespread but, until now, neglected cause of  human dysfunction in the workplace. Whether intentionally or not, a supervisor can sometimes create irreparable damage, especially to those who already feel insecure, by a negative and demeaning \\"message\\" which need not be expressed in words but comes through loud and clear nonetheless..\\" Nonetheless they are.

What I especially appreciate is his eminently practical approach to the unique and often daunting challenge of marketing: How to create or increase and then sustain demand for whatever one offers for sale? In this volume, he identifies and then explains various \\"unexpected rules that ring the cash register.\\" Fox obviously agrees with Peter Drucker who asserted that the purpose of any business enterprise is to create a customer; the two basic functions are marketing and innovation, with marketing being \\"the distinguishing, the unique function of a business.\\" He also agrees with Theodore Leavitt that \\"all industry begins with the customer and his or her needs, not with a patent, a raw material, or a selling skill.\\" Fox wrote this book for those who need to be, want to be, or already are a marketing superstar.<br />He divides his material within 57 chapters and includes within the narrative a series of \\"unexpected rules.\\" He also poses four different \\"Marketing Superstar Instant Challenges.\\" Each requires the reader to apply \\"marketing superstar\\" thinking to the given situation. (Later in the book, Fox provides the answers with explanations.) In chapters LVI and LVII, he reviews the hallmarks -- the guiding principles -- of the great marketing companies and of marketing superstars. In the final chapter, he observes that certain companies \\"consistently lead or dominate, their industries. They are feared by their competitors. What do they share in common? Fox suggests 17 characteristics, each of which he briefly discusses.<br />When recommending this book to others, I suggest that they create self-diagnostic exercises for themselves and their associates based on the aforementioned hallmarks -- the guiding principles -- of the great marketing companies and of marketing superstars as well as on the 17 characteristics of the \\"killer competitor companies.\\" The easiest way is to pose a statement and then require one of four responses: Always True, Generally True, Occasionally True, or Never True...or Totally Agree, Generally Agree, Generally Disagree, or Totally Disagree.<br />For example, from Summary #1 (Chapter LVI):<br />#3 We focus on market share as measured in units rather than sales dollars.<br />#6 We have constant contact with our customers.<br />#7 The entire company is oriented toward toward marketing. Everyone in the company understands that marketing is the only renewing activity. Every employee values the customer.<br />#27 We price products to value, not to cost, and fearlessly sell that price.<br />Or for example, from Summary #2 (Chapter LVII):<br />#1 Marketing, in all forms, in detail, is the driving culture of our organization.<br />#6 We are always making our products and/or services better not matter how good they are. We never leave well enough alone.<br />#8 We view change and the need to adapt as windows of opportunity.<br />#16 We value strategy and execution, not endless planning and analysis. Our three most important words in strategy are \\"execution, \\"execution,\\" \\"execution.\\"<br />These are but an indication of the abundance of insights, observations, suggestions, and admonitions which Fox provides throughout his book. Only through a careful reading of it can one be prepared to understand and appreciate, then execute with maximum impact what Fox provides in his Appendix, \\"Dollarize Your Way to More Effective Marketing.\\" It would be a great disservice to Fox as well as to those who read this review for me to say any more about the Appendix.<br />Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book? I am tempted to say everyone in any organization about which there is any doubt of its ability to survive...period. However, obviously, that would strike many (if not most) people as an irresponsible exaggeration. So, I now suggest that this book will be of greatest value to decision-makers (at all levels) who are both willing and able to embrace and then follow the \\"unexpected rules\\" which Fox advocates. They are clear. They are practical. They are doable. And together, if performed with the precision of a symphony orchestra, they can indeed create a \\"music\\" unique to capitalism: Ka-ching! Ka-ching!sible exaggeration.

How much of it is credible? Is she really as brilliant and resourceful as he suggests? Is she also as spiteful and mean-spirited as he suggests? As I read this book, I sometimes had a difficult time determining what Byron makes of the material he shares. His attitude seems ambivalent as indeed do those who have worked for and with Stewart over the years. Much of the material was provided by friends, enemies, acquaintances, business associates, and employees. He and most of those interviewed seem to admire what she has achieved.  However, he and many of them also seem to deplore her values, attitudes, and (especially) her mistreatment of others.<br />Byron met Stewart in Westport (CT) and knew her only casually as a neighbor whom he encountered infrequently. At that time, he was advancing his career as a journalist, writing for the Wall Street Journal. He became intrigued by the rapid development of her own career and decided to write a book about her. Initially Stewart agreed to cooperate with him but later reconsidered. At no point in the narrative does Byron express any animosity toward her (or about anything else, for that matter) but many others do, notably Kathy Tatlock and Norma Collier. Along the way, Byron also examines Stewart as wife and mother. He observes: \\"As Martha's fame grew, and she became increasingly absorbed in making it grow still more, she seemed to have less and less time for her personal relationships -- not just with [husband] Andy and [daughter] Alexis, but with her employees, her neighbors, and anyone else she might encounter day to day. A brusque efficiency began to take over her conversations.\\" Eventually her husband left her and other personal relationships deteriorated further as she continued to pursue and achieve her various business objectives. Today, she owns Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. (How she regained control should guarantee her immediate induction into the \\"Business Hall of Fame.\\") She is among the wealthiest and most influential people (male or female) in the United States and, if consumer markets continue to expand in underdeveloped countries, it seems certain that both her wealth and her influence will increase exponentially.<br />Throughout his book, Byron shares lots of opinions and evaluations of Stewart (his and others') as he attempts to understand her character and personality, her life and career. He seems to try very hard to be circumspect. The Stewart who emerges by the end of the book reminds me of what Walt Whitman once said of himself: \\"Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself. I am large. I contain multitudes.\\" For whatever they may be worth, here are a few of my own reactions to the material in this page-turner of a book. First, I wonder how much criticism of Stewart there would be if she were a male. Is she held accountable to the same standards as, for example, Jack (\\"Neutron\\") Welch? Also, often mentioned in the same context as Oprah Winfrey, Stewart seems much more interested in lifestyle; Winfrey in quality of life. Big difference. Most people love Oprah; few seem to love Martha. How to explain that? Also, at a time when \\"branding\\" is an especially hot business topic, Stewart seems to be among the very few celebrities who IS the brand...rather than any merchandise (magazines, books, videos, television programs, etc.) associated with her.<br />Finally, I am intrigued by the number of high-powered male corporate executives who underestimated her, who (in Byron's word) made the mistake of \\"chick-ing\\" Stewart. How else to explain the fact that she was able to regain total control of a variety of media assets (e.g. Martha Stewart Living magazine and a series of spin-off books called \\"The Best of Martha Stewart Living\\") from Time Inc. in 1997 for $2 million out of her own pocket, about three days worth of the assets' revenue. She then created anew company (Martha Stewart Living Multimedia LLC), took it public in October 1999, and saw the company's stock price nearly triple during its first day of trading. That gave \\"the one-time Connecticut caterer a personal net worth of more than $1 billion.\\" Hers indeed is one of the most extraordinary business careers in American history, one which -- over an extended period of time --  accelerated with increasing impact and profitability. As presented by Byron, Martha Stewart the businesswomen and Martha Stewart the person seem essentially the same, and that will continue to be true, for better or worse, as an uncertain future reveals itself.d a new company (Martha Stewart Living Multimedia LLC), took it public in October 1999, and saw the company's stock price nearly triple during its first day of trading.

Zimmermann has written six separate but related books and then combined them in a single volume. The first five comprise Part One and are brief but exceptionally informative biographies of John Hay, Alfred T. Mahan, Elihu Root. Henry Cabot Lodge, and Theodore Roosevelt; the sixth is a brilliant analysis of how these five men, together, achieved achieved for the United States \\"the first great triumph\\" of its global expansion or as Zimmermann describes it, \\"the birth of American imperialism.\\" As he explains in the Introduction, \\"These five men were remarkable by any measure. Two of them, Roosevelt and Root, won the Nobel Peace Prize. All were intellectuals and thought of themselves as such. All except Root were notable authors. Roosevelt wrote thirty-eight books, and Lodge twenty-seven, mostly on themes of American history....Mahan produced an analysis of the influence of seas power that profoundly affected American policy and became required reading in the British, German, and Japanese navies. Root, who had been one of the most talented corporate lawyers of his time, became after his government service a forceful advocate of the rule of law in international relations.\\" Remarkable indeed by any measure.<br />In Part Two, Zimmermann shifts his reader's attention to a period extending from 1898 until 1909 when, through the collective and coordinated efforts of the five men and their associates, the United States acquired Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, and Panama. When explaining the legacies of this brief but productive period, Zimmermann observes; \\"First, they created an authentic American imperialism that was confident in its objectives but modest in its application....The second legacy of the founders of American imperialism was their preparation of the United States to be a great power. Pragmatic as they were, Roosevelt and his friends understood that they were embarked on a grand adventure. The `first great triumph' that Roosevelt fore-saw on the troopship to Cuba did indeed become a `world movement.'...Third, these five imperialists produced the first comprehensive assertion of U.S. security interests abroad....The fourth legacy of the founders was the creation of two foreign policy priorities, human rights and stability, that have remained in tension with each other ever since....The fifth consequence of the work done by the men who launched America as a great power was to strengthen the American presidency. All five were followers of Alexander Hamilton and believers in activist government.\\"<br />I was fascinated to learn how all this was accomplished, especially during such a brief period of time. Of course, as Zimmermann explains, \\"the five imperialists\\" encountered staunch and formidable opposition. However, they wholly agreed with an opinion expressed by journalist John O'Sullivan that during the \\"era of American greatness\\" their nation was \\"destined to manifest to mankind the excellence of divine principles.\\" (1839) Hence the origin of what has since been known as the concept of Manifest Destiny. Those seeking to understand the current state of our nation's relations with other countries throughout the world will find Zimmermann's book especially informative.on the troopship to Cuba did indeed become a `world movement.'...Third, these five imperialists produced the first comprehensive assertion of U.S. security interests abroad....The fourth legacy of the founders was the creation of two foreign policy priorities, human rights and stability, that have remained in tension with each other ever since....The fifth consequence of the work done by the men who launched America as a great power was to strengthen the American presidency.

In Good to Great, Jim Collins and his research associates learned that the great companies \\"...first got the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and the right people in the right seats -- and then they figured out where to drive it. The old adage 'People are the most important asset' turned out to be wrong. People are not [italics] your most important asset. The right [italics] people are.\\"<br />The right people share the same values and, together, sustain their organization's commitment to those values. If involved in their organization's recruiting and interviewing process, as they should be, they will help to ensure that the right people will be hired (i.e. allowed on the \\"bus\\"). Obviously it is important to get talent and task in proper alignment. It is equally important to keep an organization's values in proper alignment with its objective.<br />Tulgan's important book is even more relevant and more valuable now than it was when first published about two years ago. As its subtitle correctly indicates, he explains \\"how to manage and compete in the high-tech, high-speed, knowledge-based, superfluid economy.\\" That is to say, he wrote the book for decision-makers in all organizations (regardless of size or nature) to help them determine HOW to get \\"the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and the right people in the right seats\\"...and then keep them there.<br />All of the companies which Tulgan discusses (e.g. Johnson & Johnson and J.P. Morgan Chase) demonstrate one of Tulgan's core concepts: \\"In the new economy, every term of employment -- schedules, location, assignments, coworkers, pay, and more -- will be negotiation, whether you like it or not. The most valuable talent will have the most negotiating power. Every employment relationship will last exactly as long as the terms are agreeable to all parties.\\" There is a new set of organizing principles for employing people in the new economy:<br />' Talent is the show.<br />' Staff the work, not the jobs.<br />' Pay for performance, and nothing else.<br />' Turn managers into coaches.<br />' Train for the mission, not for the long haul.<br />' Create as many career paths as you have people.<br />Tulgan devotes a separate chapter to each of these principles, explaining with meticulous care how to apply each to his reader's specific business situation. Note how these principles apply to any organization which competes for available talent and then is challenged to keep its best people who, more easily now more than ever before, can leave the \\"bus\\" whenever and wherever they wish. This situation is as common among the great companies whom Collins discusses as it is among the local merchants from whom we purchase various products and services.<br />Extensive research indicates that only one in 28-30 dissatisfied customers ever complains to the provider of the given product or service. All others simply never do business with that provider again...while continuing to express their dissatisfaction to family members, friends, and business associates. More often than not, customer dissatisfaction is the result of an unpleasant personal experience rather than because of a product defect. To extend Collins' metaphor, customers are among the \\"passengers\\" and can also get off the \\"bus\\" whenever and wherever they wish. Much has been written about the power of BUZZ (i.e. word-of-mouth) and the importance of creating \\"customer evangelists.\\" From my perspective, winning the \\"talent war\\" is essential to winning the competition for customer's repeat business. A careful implementation of the strategies and tactics which Tulgan recommends in this book will help to achieve that ultimate objective.<br />Otherwise, not having \\"the right people on the bus...and in the right place,\\" the \\"bus\\" will either never reach its destination or in the highly unlikely event that it does so, arrive with few (if any) \\"passengers\\" aboard.Staff the work, not the jobs.<br />' Pay for performance, and nothing else.<br />' Turn managers into coaches.<br />' Train for the mission, not for the long haul. <br />' Create as many career paths as you have people.<br />Tulgan devotes a separate chapter to each of these principles, explaining with meticulous care how to apply each to his reader's specific business situation.

1213453:US	51147790	R1Q1SWD7BAHBZJ	0965096556	405836107	Confessions of Shameless Self Promoters	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Celebrating Self with Courage and Creativity	As I was about to read this book, frankly, I was somewhat deterred by its title just as I was before reading Marilyn Ross's Shameless Marketing for Brazen Hussies. Titles such as these seem so blatant, so self-serving, so crass, so....<br />In fact, the same can be said of the content in these two books as well as in Allen's Confessions of Shameless Internet Promoters. And that is precisely the key point: because each of us receives each day (on average) about 3,000 (or is it 30,000?) \\"messages\\" of various kinds, it is more difficult now than ever before to penetrate all the noise and all the clutter. We now live in what Tom Davenport and John Beck call \\"the attention economy.\\" The most valuable currency is gaining the interest and attention of others and then, over time, earning their respect and trust.<br />As a result, we should feel no shame when aggressively promoting ourselves if we do so with honesty and integrity; people buy from other people, not from companies. Nor should we feel any shame when aggressively promoting a product or service if it is of sufficient quality, fills a legitimate need, is priced fairly, and delivers substantial value. To those who complain that women seem \\"brazen\\" when doing so, I say \\"Get over it.\\"<br />In this volume, Allen introduces each of the 13 chapters with her own thoughts about the given subject (e.g. \\"You Cannot Not Market\\" and \\"Building Your Unique Brand Recognition\\") and then several of the 68 guest contributors share their own thoughts, feelings, experiences, advice, etc. Inevitably, the value of individual segments will be determined almost entirely by the specific deeds and interests of each reader. All of the contributors' comments are worth sharing but not all of them are immediately relevant to each reader's circumstances. However, I think the entire book should be read and then re-read. Circumstances change, frequently without warning. We may need tomorrow or next week what we do not need today. In The Art of War, Sun Tzu observes that every battle is won or lost before it is fought. There is much to be said for \\"shameless\\" preparation.<br />For many, Chapter One (\\"An Introduction to Shameless Self Promotion\\") may well be the most valuable portion of the book because it provides all manner of reassurances that shameless self promotion really is legitimate, indeed imperative in today's marketplace IF (huge \\"if\\") it is conducted with honesty and integrity as well as tenacity. Allen provides a brief quotation on the title page of each chapter. For Chapter One, \\"If you don't blow your own horn someone else will use it as a spittoon.\\" (Anonymous) Brief contributions by five marketing \\"gurus\\" -- Jeffrey Storie, Mark Victor Hansen, Don Taylor, Dana Burke, and Rick Segel -- then follow.<br />While reading this book, I frequently made connections between it and another book I read recently, Phillip McGraw's Self Matters: Creating Your Life from Inside Out. Directly or indirectly, Allen and most of her 68 contributors assert that effective promotion of one's self is wholly dependent upon having a strong sense of self-confidence and self-worth. Stated another way, the effectiveness of self promotion in the external world is wholly dependent on creating and then nourishing a healthy inner self. I agree with McGraw that self not only matters, it is all that we have. It does much more than identify us: it defines us. If we do not value it, why should anyone else?<br />Ignore the overheated words and phrases. Read all the lines but also read between them. Absorb and digest what Allen and her associates have to say. Then re-read at least the first chapter. This book has much of value to say about both self and promotion: the health of the former determines the effectiveness of the latter.<br />Many of those who begin reading this book looking for specific strategies and tactics will indeed find them but also something else of much greater value: a better understanding of themselves and, especially, of what may have delayed, diminished or even prevented their success in life until now. Who knows? You may be among them. Most of us are., especially, of what may have delayed, diminished or even prevented their success in life until now. Who knows? You may be among them. Most of us are.	2003-02-27

Reviewing a book such as this again supports the truth of that old bromide, \\"a picture is worth a thousand words.\\" At least no words of mine can do full justice to Brown's talent as a photographer. He settled in Whitingham in 1968 and began to teach in a small rural school. During the years since then, he has taken thousands of photographs of Vermont in search of what is, to his own eye, that state's unique character. As he explains in the Introduction, over time he shifted his attention from Vermont's natural beauty to what he calls \\"the cultivated landscape.\\" A preponderance of the photographs in this volume (many of which not previously published) were taken in the \\"Northeast Kingdom.\\" He organizes his work according to the seasons which include the \\"Off-Season\\" from late-October until Thanksgiving. For at least a few of those who read this review, my comments about Brown may be of some interest but, I realize, merely suggest a context for the creation of works of art which I lack the talent to describe. If you cannot visit Vermont in person, do so by seeing it through Brown's eyes. If you cherish his book as much as I do, you will also want to have a copy of The Beauty of Vermont, edited by Tom Slayton. As both books clearly indicate, the soul of Vermont is its beauty...and beauty its soul.	2003-02-26

Having carefully observed Gerstner during the infrequent interviews to which he reluctantly agreed, the book seems to have been written by him without assistance except stenographic. The style and tone as well as the observations are clearly his. This is important. More often than not, a book bearing the name of a CEO as its author has been rigorously edited and thoroughly sanitized by one or more \\"manuscript doctors\\" before publication. Not so with this one.<br />Its title was perhaps suggested by that of a book written by Rosabeth Moss Kanter (When Giants Learn to Dance, 1989) and implies that it may be unlikely but is nonetheless possible for an organization as large and as cumbersome as IBM once was to become \\"quick on its feet\\" again. Soon after becoming CEO, Gerstner realized that IBM's culture -- not its core strategies -- prevented it from being able to \\"dance.\\" As Gerstner observes, \\"[IBM's] decades-long run of uninterrupted success ties in with the other closely related, and vitally important, aspect of IBM's recent history. This is about its corporate culture -- specifically, the kind of culture that arises in an environment without intense competitive pressure or threats.\\" By the time Gerstner had become CEO, the company and its people had lost touch with external realities. It was widely believed that what was happening in the marketplace was essentially irrelevant to the success of the company. \\"IBM's dominant position had created a self-contained, self-sustaining world for the company. IBM had ridden one horse, and ridden it well. But that horse could carry it only so far before it broke down.<br />This was the corporate culture which Gerstner encountered as he assumed his duties, a culture the product of two predominant forces: the runaway success of the System/360, and, the impact of the antitrust suit filed against IBM by the United States Department of Justice on January 31, 1969, the final day of the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. \\"For thirteen years IBM lived under the specter of a federally mandated breakup.\\"<br />It would be a mistake to assume that most of the credit for what was accomplished at IBM during Gerstner's tenure as CEO should be given to him. He dedicated this book to \\"the thousands of IBMers who never gave up on their company, their colleagues, and themselves. They are the real heroes of the reinvention of IBM.\\" This book explains how that was accomplished, a transformation whose objective was to re-establish \\"the high-performance cultured that animated IBM under both Watsons.\\"<br />Having relinquished his duties as CEO to Sam Palmisano, Gerstner suggests that his successor has an opportunity to make connections to IBM's past which Gerstner had not. \\"His challenge will be to make them without going backward; to know that the centrifugal forces that drove IBm to be inward-looking and self-absorbed still lie powerful in the company. Continuing to drive change while building on the best (and [in italics] only the best) of the past is the ultimate description of the job of Chief Executive Officer, International Business Machines Corporation.\\" It is probably too early to take full measure of Gerstner's performance in that position. However, now having his own account of those critically important years in IBM's history, we can at least appreciate the nature and extent of what he and his associates experienced...and what together they eventually accomplished.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Kevin Maney's The Maverick and the Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM as well as Thomas Watson, Jr. and Peter Petre's Father, Son & Co: My Life at IBM and Beyond.share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Kevin Maney's The Maverick and the Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM as well as Thomas Watson, Jr. and Peter Petre's Father, Son & Co: My Life at IBM and Beyond.	2003-02-26

One of the revelations which surprised me most was that what they call \\"Level 5 Leadership\\" invalidates conventional wisdom concerning the so-called \\"charismatic\\" CEO. (Please see pages 17-40 as well as pages 72-73 in Good to Great.) After four years of his own rigorous research, Badaracco seems to have arrived at many of the same conclusions that Collins and his associates did. For example, that the most effective leaders are passionate about the organizations they lead but not about their own careers; that they are relentless in the pursuit of what Collins calls Big Hairy Audacious Goals (BHAGs) but, meanwhile, manifest impeccable personal as well as professional integrity; that they are (in Badaracco's words) \\"quiet leaders because their modesty and restraint are in large measure responsible for their impressive achievements.\\"<br />Badaracco goes on to note that because many big problems can only be resolved by a long series of small efforts, \\"quiet leadership, despite its seemingly slow pace, often turns out to be the quickest way to make an organization -- and the world -- a better place.\\" Invoking metaphors, I presume to suggest that the so-called \\"charismatic leader\\" resembles a Roman candle or perhaps a single sparkler whereas the \\"Level 5 Leader,\\" the Quiet Leader,\\" resembles a Bunsen burner. Navy fliers training for duty aboard aircraft carriers are told, \\"There are no old, bold pilots.\\" Badaracco correctly asserts that preparation, caution, care, and attention to detail are usually the best approach to everyday challenges. \\"What usually matters are careful, thoughtful, practical efforts by people working far from the limelight.\\" How long might it take to achieve a BHAG? Collins suggests ten to 30 years...\\"or more.\\" The leadership required over such an extended period of time (leadership which includes but is not limited to the CEO) reflects a specific way of thinking about people, organizations, and effective action. \\"It is a way of understanding the flow of events and discerning the best ways to make a difference.\\" Moreover, Badaracco adds, \\"...in a small way, quiet leadership is also an act of faith: an expression of confidence in the ultimate force of what [Albert] Schweitzer called 'small and obscure deeds.'\\"<br />The material in this brilliant book is carefully organized within nine chapters whose titles correctly suggest their respective focal points. For example, in Chapter Eight (\\"Nudge, Test, and Escalate Gradually\\"), Badaracco suggests that quiet leaders \\"prefer more cautious, modest ways of thinking and acting. Instead of hunting confidently for the [in italics] right answer, they concentrate on finding the right ways to to eventually get sound, workable answers.\\" For them, unlike those who are impulsive and flamboyant, \\"leadership is a process, often a long and oblique one, not a single or courageous event.\\" They are practical but NOT expedient. They focus on what is reasonably attainable rather than on what is ideal and, therefore, almost never attainable. They \\"buy a little time\\" (the title of Chapter Three) inorder to drill down deeper to reveal the technical and political elements of the questions to be answered and the problems to be solved. They have a bias for action but only after sufficient (albeit imperfect) preparation. Their core values are non-negotiable even as they view compromise as being essential to consensus. The \\"eloquence\\" of such women and men is expressed by what they and their associates accomplish together each day, to be sure, but also year after year.<br />Badaracco includes an especially apt quotation in his Introduction. It is an excerpt from Schweitzer's autobiography, Out of My Life and Thought, and provides what I consider to be an appropriate conclusion to this review:<br />\\"Of all the will toward the ideal in mankind only a small part can manifest itself in public action. All the rest of this force must be content with small and obscure deeds. The sum of these, however, is a thousand times stronger than the acts of those who receive wide public recognition. The latter, compared to the former, are like the foam on the waves of a deep ocean.\\"and provides what I consider to be an appropriate conclusion to this review:<br />\\"Of all the will toward the ideal in mankind only a small part can manifest itself in public action.

He has revised and updated the book to accommodate the emergence of the Internet, e-business, and globalization initiatives. To his credit, his Guerrilla principles remain valid and, if anything, are even more relevant and more valuable now than ever before. It is important to keep in mind that, as he explains in Guerrilla Creativity, creative marketing is not something that you do. \\"Instead, it's something that your prospects get.\\" Guerrilla principles guide and inform initiatives by which to produce desired results, whatever those may be. Perhaps to create or increase demand for what one offers. (I use the word \\"offers\\" rather than \\"sells\\" because the same principles can also be invaluable, for example,  to those seeking charitable contributions to a non-profit organization.) Perhaps to inform a prospect or reassure a client; in terms of a competitor, perhaps to create confusion, discomfort, and even despair.<br />Although the book's subtitle suggests that the \\"secrets\\" provided will help to make big profits from a small business, Levinson's principles can (as I have indicated) help to achieve a variety of other desired results which may include but are not limited to profits; moreover, his principles can be as helpful to a multinational corporation as they can to a local family-owned business.<br />The material is carefully organized within five sections: The Guerrilla Approach to Marketing -- Updated, Mini-Media Marketing, Maxi-Media Marketing, Nonmedia Marketing, and finally, Launching Your Guerrilla Marketing Attack. Levinson also provides an especially useful concluding section, \\"Information Arsenal for Guerrillas\\" (pages 363-372) which directs the reader to hundreds of resources such as a bibliography as well as information about relevant newsletters, periodicals, audiotapes, and videotapes.<br />I especially appreciate the fact Levinson includes marginal notes throughout his narrative. They make it so much easier to review key points which may not have been highlighted or underlined. Also, his Index is much more extensive than what authors of business books usually provide. This is in all respects a user-friendly volume whose material, if understood and then applied both effectively and (yes) appropriately, can be of substantial value to any decision-maker who seeks to create or increase demand for whatever her or his organization offers.<br />What sets Levinson's various \\"Guerrilla\\" books apart from most others is his consistent point of view. It has no doubt been influenced by Sun Tzu and especially by several of Sun Tzu's strategies such as when far away, seem near...or vice versa; when small, seem large...or vice versa; when exhausted, seem vigorous...or vice versa, etc. It was Sun Tzu who explained the importance of thorough preparation by asserting that every battle is won or lost before it is fought. Although we usually think of such strategies as being used only by \\"Davids,\\" the same strategies (albeit with modifications) can also be used very effectively by \\"Goliaths.\\"<br />In the first chapter, Levinson identifies 12 differences between Guerrilla marketing and traditional marketing. They are essentially differences of judgment, values, and priorities rather than of resources. I agree with Jason Jennings who suggests that it's not the large that eat the small...it's the fast that eat the slow. Size and speed are not mutually exclusive. Many successful organizations have both. However, Levinson is quite correct when stressing the importance (and benefits) of having an underdog mentality. Differing somewhat with Andrew Grove, I presume to suggest that not all survivors are paranoid...but most are. The  Guerrilla mentality takes no one and nothing for granted. Ever.<br />For me, one of Levinson's most interesting ideas involves the Guerrilla's relationship with competition. He goes one step further than the Biblical David who wisely avoided physical contact with Goliath: \\"Guerrilla marketing asks you to forget about competition temporarily and to scout opportunities to cooperate with other businesses and support each other in a mutual quest for profits.\\" That is to say, rather than facing Goliath in combat, Levinson's David would to go into partnership with those vendors who provide a variety of products and services to the Philistines. Goliath would be hired to handle accounts receivable. Eventually David would buy out his partners, then retain them on an outsource basis to continue servicing the Philistine account while he seeks new business opportunities elsewhere within and beyond the Middle East. Perhaps sell franchises in military provisions while remaining owner/CEO of a parent company which provides various services to its franchisees through subsidiaries such as Rent-a-Camel, Caravan Leasing, Goliath Security Services, Galleys Unlimited, etc.<br />Presumably Levinson agrees with me that it would be a mistake, indeed highly un-Guerrilla-like, to adopt all or even most of the strategies and tactics he offers in this book. First, do a rigorous analysis of your organization's needs and interests, of course, but also or its strengths and especially its weaknesses. (You can be sure your toughest competitors already know where you are most vulnerable. Do you?) Next, set the priorities for action (NOT discussion) and develop a cohesive and comprehensive plan to achieve the most important objectives. Then cherry-pick whichever of Levinson's proffered strategies and tactics will be most helpful to those efforts. There are more of them in this book than you can possibly use at any one time, anyway. However, priorities can change...often because of a competitor's initiatives. (If you did not see them coming, that's your fault.  A Guerrilla always sleeps with one eye open.) When circumstances change, different strategies and tactics may be needed. Re-read Levinson's book. You'll probably find whatever you need.<br />Final point: A Guerrilla never trusts only one book for advice on marketing. Nor should you. Check out Levinson's bibliography. There are no glaring omissions other than Sun Tzu's The Art of War (Griffith translation) and Reis and Trout's Positioning. Among the dozens he cites, my own preferences are Beckwith's Selling the Invisible, Cohen's The Marketing Plan, Levitt's The Marketing Imagination, McKenna's Real Time, Reichheld and Teal's The Loyalty Effect, and Schmitt and Simonson's Marketing Aesthetics as well as Schmitt's subsequent Experiential Marketing.involves the Guerrilla's relationship with competition.

Consumers now experience an information, indeed a sensory overload of marketing messages which makes differentiation even more difficult now than ever before. Beckwith explains how to penetrate such clutter.<br />After identifying and then analyzing in detail four \\"Key Trends,\\" he challenges dozens of widely held beliefs about effective marketing which, in his judgment, have been invalidated by those trends. For example:<br />* \\"Word-of-mouth advertising has become the world's most overrated form of marketing.\\" Why? \\"Our mobility propels us away from [old networks through which to process word-of-mouth communications] and into new cities where everyone seems to come from somewhere else.\\"<br />* \\"Cold calls leave people cold.\\" Why? \\"People feel most comfortable with people they know -- and mistrust ones they've never heard of. You must get known [to them prior to initial contact].\\"<br />* \\"It is not what you say; it is what people hear. It is not what you communicate; it's what gets communicated.\\" Why? \\"You tell your story with words, perhaps, but words are only symbols....Written words, in other words, are just symbols of symbols.\\"<br />* \\"Clients do not buy solutions.\\" Why? Numerous research studies indicate that \\"responsiveness to phone calls\\" and \\"sincere interest in developing a relationship\\" ranked higher in importance than \\"technical skill\\" -- the ability to devise solutions. According to Beckwith, \\"It isn't the better solution that clients value. It's the simple act of listening itself. We value it because of how we feel. It makes us feel important.\\"<br />He suggests an abundance of strategies and tactics by which to achieve any organization's desired objectives, given the aforementioned trends which continue to create an especially volatile, increasingly ferocious competitive marketplace. For example, how to cope with \\"Option and Information Overload\\" (pages 45-96) and how to accommodate \\"The [Clients'] Wish to Connect\\" (pages 195-242). Moreover, in the final section of his book, Beckwith answers the question \\"Why do some people and businesses thrive?\\" He includes an especially relevant quotation from David Landes' The Wealth and Poverty of Nations:<br />\\"In this world, the optimists have it., not because they are always right, but because they are positive. Even when they are wrong they are positive, and that is the way of achievement, correction, improvement, and success. Educated, eye-open optimism pays.\\"<br />Beckwith urges his reader to build \\"something that fills you with passion, and then spread its flames into every corner of your business....Triumph, then, belongs to those who believe...[to those who take] the path which runs along the cliff -- that one, the one without any guardrails.\\" By doing so, he assures his reader, she or he will know \\"the exhilaration of the ride and the pride you feel when you reach the end will inspire you to take that path again and again.\\" Clients love comfort, Beckwith insists, especially in an age when there are so many choices and messages. They crave comfort more than anything else. They will love those who provide it with expertise, clarity, integrity, and sincere interest...but also with passion because it shows \\"you love what you do.\\"<br />Those who share my high opinion of this book are urged to check out several of the sources listed in Beckwith's annotated \\"Reading List for Growing a Business\\" (pages 267-274). To that list I presume to add Stephen Denning's The Springboard, David Maister's Practice What You Preach, and Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich.an especially volatile, increasingly ferocious competitive marketplace.

I do not damn with faint praise when sharing that observation. Over the years, working with young executives to accelerate the development of their leadership and management skills, I soon became convinced that they lacked sufficient real-world business experience and a consequent frame-of-reference. Thornton provides the latter in this book and in The Triangles of Management and Leadership.<br />He carefully organizes his material within six Parts: a brief Introduction which literally introduces his \\"3-C Leadership Model,\\" Challenging the Status Quo, Building Confidence, Coaching to Achieve Top Performance, Setting the Example, and finally, Leadership Development. It is important for relatively inexperienced executives (leadership wannabes) to keep in mind that, throughout his narrative, Thornton is building a model of superior leadership so that those who read his book can gain an awareness of areas in which to improve, and, to learn specifically how to achieve such improvement. This same model will enable supervisors to clarify (perhaps even reconsider) their own criteria when measuring the performance of those for whom they are responsible, then address more effectively those areas in which there is greatest need for improved performance. So, what I am now suggesting is that this book can be of substantial value to anyone who has not as yet become a superior leader.<br />A few brief comments on the \\"Be the Leader Survey\\" which Thornton includes after the final chapter. Respondents are asked to evaluate themselves within seven categories which correlate with the information Thornton has previously provided. I wish more authors of business books would include such a self-audit. The results are never wholly definitive, of course. (How could they be?) Nonetheless, several of Thornton's key points will be re-emphasized as respondents measure themselves in relation to them.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Joan Magretta's What Management Is as well as just about anything written by Warren Bennis, David Maister's Practice What You Preach, Jeffrey J. Fox's How to Become a Great Boss, Rex P. Gatto's The Smart Manager's F.A.Q. Guide, Steven Silbiger's The Ten Day M.B.A, Milo Sobel's. The 12-Hour MBA, Robert F.

(Note: A \\"possible\\" does not become a \\"prospect\\" unless and until she or he commits to take the Next Step.) The progress and satisfactory conclusion of this collaborative process require a series of Next Steps to which the prospect is agreeable. Schiffman asserts (and I wholly agree) that sales \\"don't just happen\\"; rather, they are achieved by the aforementioned process which requires a prospect's permission to collaborate, permission which the salesman must obtain at each stage.<br />The sequence of Next Steps is not merely a buying of time, however. On the contrary, if skillfully managed by the salesperson, it accelerates the buying cycle as objections are systematically eliminated. To repeat, the objective for the salesperson at each stage in the process is to have the prospect agree to their taking, together, the Next Step. Moreover, the Final Step is not closing on a given sale. There is no Final Step. If I understand Schiffman's thinking and the 26 strategies which he advocates, there is always a Next Step to strengthen even more the relationship with the buyer who will presumably make other purchases later.<br />Recently I learned that, after surveying many thousands of consumers of various products and services over a period of five years to learn why they no longer did business with certain companies, researchers were told that 1% of the customers had died; 3% had moved out of the area; 5% had been \\"influenced\\" away; 9% had found \\"better service\\" elsewhere; and 14% had experienced \\"unresolved conflicts\\" with the given company.<br />That adds up to 32%. Now here's the kicker:<br />68% left because of \\"perceived indifference.\\"<br />Hence the obvious importance of what happens after a sale is made. Schiffman is dead-on when insisting that one of the salesperson's greatest challenges is to proceed, relentlessly, to each Next Step after one sale and before the next each customer. In this book, he explains HOW to do that, also why; it is the salesperson's responsibility sustain forward movement. Schiffman also explains why, in certain situations, it would be a waste of time to continue with certain clients without their permission. That does not preclude sustaining contact, and doing so with style and grace. His eminently sensible implication is that there are significant differences between cultivation and solicitation.<br />Throughout the book, the reader is provided with an abundance of practical advice which includes don'ts as well as do's. For example, Schiffman explains in Chapter 2 how to find out \\"who's really playing ball\\"...and who isn't; in Chapter 8, how to make forward progress even when the prospect says no; in Chapter 12, new ways to wake up sleeping prospects; in Chapter 20, how to raise the tough issues before the prospect does; and in Chapter 24, \\"how to find out where we really stand in the prospect's world.\\" Simply knowing what the 26 \\"proven strategies\\" are is well worth the cost of this book; having Schiffman explain how to use each most effectively creates for the book a value that is incalculable.<br />Of course, the best advice in the world is worthless unless and until it results in appropriate action.

Each offers authoritative answers to the most important questions concerning its specific subject. The material in this book is drawn from a variety of sources which include a Peter Cappelli article on market-driven retention in the Harvard Business Review and various other articles published in Harvard Management Review Update as well as the hiring module found in Harvard ManageMentor®, an online service. Each volume is indeed \\"a highly practical resource for readers with all levels of experience.\\"<br />Peter Cappelli served as subject advisor to Richard Luecke, writer of this and other books in the Harvard Business School Essentials Series and author or developer of more than 30 other books as well as several dozen articles. As Luecke notes in the Introduction, Bradford Smith completed a study of 54 U.S. companies and learned that the average managerial \\"mis-hire\\" costs a company 24 times the individual's base compensation. How can that be possible? \\"Smith points to all the usual suspects\\" (the mis-hire's compensation and cost of maintenance, the initial hiring costs, severance expenses, the costs associated hiring and training a replacement,\\" etc.) but the biggest cost...is the cost of the mistakes, failures, and missed opportunities that result from having the wrong person in a management position over several years.\\"<br />The material in this volume is carefully organized within seven chapters, followed by three appendices which provide a sample job description and targeted interview questions as well as discussion of various \\"legal landmines\\" in hiring. Each chapter is introduced by a list of \\"Key Topics\\" to be covered in it and concludes with a brief Summary. For example, in Chapter 5, the essential strategies for \\"Keeping the Best\\" reflect why retention matters and why it is now so challenging, the special challenges of a diverse work force, and why people stay -- and why they leave. Examples are provided of two companies which successfully retain their best employees (e.g. Southwest Airlines and SAS) and then the reader is provided with several \\"tips\\" on managing retention.<br />Throughout this book, several check-lists are included. One of the most informative is Figure 3-3 (\\"What Managers Are Looking For\\") which lists the attributes rated by executives who participated in a survey conducted by McKinsey & Company in 2000. Here are the five rated highest: Interesting, challenging work (59%), Company is well-managed (48%), Work I feel passionate about (45%), Good relations with my boss (43%), and two tied for fifth place (39%): I like the culture and values, and, Recognized, rewarded for my individual contribution.<br />Ken Blanchard once observed that feedback is \\"the breakfast food of champions\\" and I agree. An excellent indication of that is the exit interview which many companies do not conduct and few of those who do do it well. In the final chapter, \\"When All Else Fails,\\" the reader is provided with some excellent advice which includes but is not limited to exit interviews. Ernst & Young is cited as a company which made a special effort \\"to re-recruit excellent employees who had defected to now-defunct dot-com companies.

Each offers authoritative answers to the most important questions concerning its specific subject. The material in this book is drawn from a variety of sources which include William J. Bruns, Michael J. Roberts, and Robert S. Kaplan as well as Harvard Business School Publishing and Harvard ManageMentor®, an online service. Each volume is indeed \\"a highly practical resource for readers with all levels of experience\\" but I think those who have only recently embarked on a business career will derive the greatest benefit.<br />This volume explains the basic concepts of finance to managers who are not financial managers. As  Richard Luecke notes in the Introduction, \\"Knowing how to finance assets, forecast future cash flows, maintain a budget, determine which operations are profit generators and which are not, and judge the real economic merits of different investment opportunities will help you stay in business and turn a profit.\\" Samuel L. Hayes served as subject advisor to Luecke, writer of this and other books in the Harvard Business School Essentials Series and author or developer of more than 30 other books as well as several dozen articles.<br />There are ten chapters followed by an Appendix: Activity-Based Budgeting. (More about that material in a moment.) Each chapter is introduced by a list of \\"Key Topics\\" to be covered in it. For example, in Chapter 5, the focus is on start-up financing, financing current operations, financing growth, establish a proper match of assets with financing, and typical financing arrangements. Obviously, all of this material may seem basic (if not self-evident) to the experienced financial manager but keep in mind that the material was carefully selected for managers who are not financial managers.<br />One of the most informative discussions is provided in the Appendix when brief but sufficient attention is given to \\"Developing Cost Drivers\\" and more specifically to activity-based budgeting (ABB) and how it differs from activity-based costing (ABC). Less experienced non-financial managers are frequently asked to prepare a report which, more often than not, involves a budget or at least a cost analysis. A basic understanding of ABB and ABC will guide and assist the completion of that task. Whereas ABC starts with the cost of resources, allocates these costs to activities, and then allocates these costs to products and/of services,  ABB starts with the planned product or service, estimated sales volume, and mix and comes up with the requisite activities to produce the mix and volume.<br />Financial managers as well as non-financial managers who supervise other non-financial managers should seriously consider providing copies of this book to those who currently do not understand \\"how to finance assets, forecast future cash flows, maintain a budget, determine which operations are profit generators and which are not, and judge the real economic merits of different investment opportunities\\" which will help [their organization] stay in business and turn a profit.\\" Of course, younger executives need not wait for such provision. Published as a paperbound volume and priced attractively, Finance for Managers would be a modest investment for them to make in their own careers.pecifically to activity-based budgeting (ABB) and how it differs from activity-based costing (ABC).

True, there is some duplication of advice in the Larsen and Herman books which convinced me that the advice is sound. Given the importance and -- yes -- the difficulty of writing a book proposal, and given the competition to obtain a literary agent and then a publisher, the investment in all three books is indeed a small price to pay.<br />The Hermans organize their excellent material within two Sections: \\"All Aspects of the Proposal -- And Some Advice Thrown In,\\" and, \\"10 Proposals That Sold -- And Why.\\" The 12 chapters which comprise Section One do indeed provide  just about everything an author needs to know about preparing a book proposal. The Hermans then shift their reader's attention to ten successful proposals and include a wealth of comments and suggestions in the margins of each. For example:<br />\\"This is a great first paragraph in that it clearly states what the book is about and establishes the author's expertise.\\" (page 85)<br />\\"This is a good example of integrating biographical material with persuasive information.\\" (page 99)<br />\\"This is an excellent Table of Contents. It is clear, organized, and clever without being hokey.\\" (page 116)<br />\\"Although she wasn't mentioned on the title page, [Kathryn] Lance is the collaborator. Her bio sketch is strong in its simplicity. Her writing credits are voluminous, but she doesn't use up space here with a comprehensive listing. Instead she showcases only credits relevant to+ the success of this particular project. Comprehensive author resumes were also attached to the proposal package as an addenda.\\" (page 174)<br />\\"This is a blending of `markets' and `promotions.' This is fine, but it's better to separate them. Although promotions are part of an overall marketing strategy, `markets' occupies a unique place in the proposal, while `promotions' can describe the details of a marketing plan.\\"<br />These five annotations correctly suggest the specificity of guidance which the Hermans provide to their reader as she or he examines ten proposals which resulted in the publication of the books they describe. Perhaps while reading this immensely informative book, others will have the same reactions that I did: That it was written expressly for me, that the Hermans had anticipated all of the questions I needed answered (and then carefully answered them for me), and that -- meanwhile -- they were disabusing me of whatever misconceptions I may have had about the process by which to obtain the services of a literary agent and/or secure a publishing contract.<br />To repeat, given the importance of an effective book proposal and difficulty of what the preparation of one involves, I strongly recommend that this book be consulted in combination with both Michael Larsen's How to Write a Book Proposal and Strunk &amp; White's The Elements of Style.part of an overall marketing strategy, `markets' occupies a unique place in the proposal, while `promotions' can describe the details of a marketing plan.\\"<br />These five annotations correctly suggest the specificity of guidance which the Hermans provide to their reader as she or he examines ten proposals which resulted in the publication of the books they describe.

True, there is some duplication of advice in the Larsen and Herman books which convinced me that the advice is sound. Given the importance and -- yes -- the difficulty of writing a book proposal, and given the competition to obtain a literary agent and then a publisher, the investment in all three books is indeed a small price to pay. Larsen organizes his excellent material as follows:<br />Part One Selling the Sizzle: The Introduction<br />Larsen explains how to get paid to write your book; how to devise the most effect \\"subject hook\\" and \\"book hook\\"; how to avoid technical and legal problems; which back matter to consider for inclusion; how to determine a book's markets; which subsidiary rights and spin-offs to consider; what a promotion plan involves; how to select and present competitive and complementary books; which resources may be needed; and how to formulate an author's biography<br />Part Two Baring the Bones and Sampling the Steak<br />Larsen explains what the the proposal outline should include; explains why verbs and structure are the two \\"keys\\" to the proposal outline; offers \\"quick fixes for six kinds of books\\"; and includes sample chapters, followed by a Q&amp;A section on what to submit<br />Part Three: Getting Your Proposal to Market<br />He explains how to assemble the proposal components; how to make the proposal stand out; identifies three ways to test-market the idea for the book; and explains how to sell the proposal fast and do so with the best terms and conditions<br />Larsen then provides two appendices: one explains how to research competitive books; the other provides three sample proposals. Throughout his narrative, he includes a number of \\"Hot Tips\\" which deserve special attention. In fact, all of the advice which he offers should be carefully considered. Wisely, Larsen assumes that his reader knows little (if anything) about the process by which to prepare a book proposal. He patiently and thoroughly guides the reader through that process. Perhaps others will have the same reaction I did when reading Larsen's book as well as the Hermans' book: That it was written expressly for me, that Larsen had anticipated all of the questions I needed answered (and then carefully answered them for me), and that -- meanwhile -- he was disabusing me of whatever misconceptions I may have had about the process by which to obtain the services of a literary agent and/or secure a publishing contract. Both books cover much of the same ground and do so with meticulous care. However, there are differences (albeit mostly subtle) in how Larsen and the Hermans present their ideas. As already indicated, I had no problem with duplications because, first, they reassured me that the advice is sound, and second, repetition increases the impact of what they agree are key points.<br />For me, some of Larsen's most valuable advice to aspiring authors is provided in Chapter Eleven, \\"Getting the Words Write: A Style Guide for Your Proposal.\\" (The same advice will be of great value to others who also need to write more effectively.) For example: \\"Avoid weak verbs. Use can for could; will for would, might, or should; is for seems to be. Readers want to be informed by an authority, so write like one! The more forceful your statement the better, particularly in the overview, when you're trying to sell your idea and yourself to an editor. Don't pussyfoot around. Be accurate, but be bold.\\" Larsen's own crisp and lucid writing is the most convincing evidence of how sound his &quot;Style Guide&quot; is.<br />I strongly recommend that readers of this book visit Larsen's Web site which offers a wealth of valuable information, such as  &quot;A Mission Statement&quot; and &quot;The Author's Platform.&quot;  And as indicated previously, given the importance of an effective book proposal and the difficulty of what the preparation of one involves, I also strongly recommend that this book be consulted in combination with both the Hermans' Write the Perfect Book Proposal and Strunk &amp; White's The Elements of Style.s  &quot;A Mission Statement&quot; and &quot;The Author's Platform.&quot;  And as indicated previously, given the importance of an effective book proposal and the difficulty of what the preparation of one involves, I also strongly recommend that this book be consulted in combination with both the Hermans' Write the Perfect Book Proposal and Strunk &amp; White's The Elements of Style.	2003-01-28
1249475:US	51147790	R2DPVBE9HWK02R	1591130786	576831096	The Triangles of Management and Leadership	Books	5	1	1	N	N	The Solid Geometry of Organizational Leadership	There are several excellent books about leadership which have been written primarily for the relatively inexperienced executive and this is one of the best, as is Thornton's subsequently published Be The Leader, Make the Difference. I do not damn with faint praise when sharing that observation. Over the years, working with young executives to accelerate the development of their leadership and management skills, I soon became convinced that they lacked sufficient real-world business experience and a consequent frame-of-reference. Thornton provides the latter in this book and in Be The Leader, Make the Difference.<br />Wisely, he selects a core concept (the triangle) which enables him to introduce and then discuss various dimensions of leadership. For example, its \\"foundation\\" which consists of mission, vision, values; what he calls \\"The Three Cs\\" (challenging people, building their self-confidence, and coaching them); three different management styles (directing, discussing, and delegating); and effective communications, without which no leadership initiatives can possibly succeed. Thornton devotes a chapter to each of several basic \\"Triangles\\": Communications, Power, Finance, and Leading Teams. The challentge for each person is to keep the three components of each triangle in an appropriate balance. At a time when change is the only constant, that is indeed a formidable challenge.<br />Although Thornton did not write this book primarily for senior-level executives, even they can benefit substantially from the book's simplicity and his ability to connect the dots. If they read this book, they will improve their skills for mentoring and coaching those for whom they are directly responsible. The material which Thornton provides is relevant to the leadership needs of any organization, regardless of size or nature. Granted, most of those involved have responsibility but no authority. Nonetheless, Thornton's observations and suggestions can inform and direct their individual initiatives. Ask these questions of any supervisor: How many of your people volunteer for difficult tasks? How many of them are willing to go \\"the extra mile\\"? How many of them are seriously committed to doing more, doing it better, and in less time? In effect, how many of them \\"get it\\"?<br />As previously indicated, college and university graduates preparing for a career in business as well as others only recently embarked on one will derive the greatest benefit from this book. I presume to suggest that one of their most important goals is to become indispensable to organizations which employ and to those who supervise them. How? The answer to that question is provided in this book.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Joan Magretta's What Management Is as well as Jeffrey J. Fox's How to Become a Great Boss, Rex P. Gatto's The Smart Manager's F.A.Q. Guide, Steven Silbiger's The Ten Day M.B.A, Milo Sobel's. The 12-Hour MBA, Robert F.

His focus in this volume is on eight companies which \\"use productivity as a competitive tool in business.\\" He set out to learn how they got that way and which lessons can be learned from them which \\"any company could follow.\\" He and his research associates examined more than 4,000 companies, settled on a short list of 100, and then reduced it to the top eight outstanding performers. The criteria for evaluation and selection included revenue per employee, return on equity, return on assets, and operating income per employee. Next, questions were posed such as \\"Has the company been overexposed?\\" and \\"Might this company pull an Enron?\\"<br />Prior to the final selection, several pit bulls (cleverly disguised as CPAs) sank their teeth into the companies' public data with the admonition to \\"take it apart, put it back together again, and provide as much assurance as possible that each of the companies was strong and likely to endure.\\" Here are the eight: IKEA, Lantech, Nucor, Ryanair, SRC Holdings, World Savings, Yellow Freight, and The Warehouse. When discussing them, Jennings focuses with meticulous on issues such as these:<br />* Tactics which are most effective when selling \\"the BIG idea\\" (strategy) to an organization (pages 23-35)<br />* Action steps which will \\"drive a stake through the heart of bureaucracy\\" (pages 66-68)<br />* The undesirable consequences of balancing the books by resorting to layoffs (pages 84-86)<br />* The meaning of WTGBRFDT and why effective use of it is essential to the success of any organization (pages 106-113)<br />* The proper role of the accounting and financial reporting functions (pages 115-121)<br />* How to \\"systematize everything\\" (pages 127-132<br />NOTE: While being interviewed by Mike Litman, Michael Gerber (author of various \\"E-Myth\\" books) observes that Ray Kroc and other entrepreneurs such as Fred Smith created \\"an absolutely impeccable turnkey system that would replicate the results [he and they] wanted no matter how many stores he opened up.

Gallagher focuses his reader's attention on several quite different companies which include The Vanguard Group, Wendy's, AutoNation, Dell Computer, Cirque du Soleil, and the St. Paul Saints. The same core values and non-negotiable principles which these companies not only illustrate but indeed celebrate can also be found in other exemplary companies such as Edward Jones, Container Store, Alston &amp; Bird, Xilinx, and Adobe Systems.<br />Gallagher helps his reader to understand her or his own business culture, how \\"strategists\\" drive operational excellence, how \\"motivators\\" create a positive working environment, how \\"team builders\\" maximize the ROI of human capital, how the \\"nimble\\" help to establish and strengthen an infrastructure for change, how \\"customer champions\\" build an enduring service culture, how the \\"passionate\\" help to create a sense of business as a way of life, and how \\"visionaries\\" provide their organization with an awareness of a higher purpose. He also explains why so many corporate cultures fail and why rigorous and comprehensive \\"cultural due diligence\\" must be completed prior to mergers, acquisitions, and other growth strategies.<br />He concludes this brilliant book with some timely observations: \\"While corporate culture has become a fashionable term to describe the core values that drive an organization, it is also very misleading, because corporate implies that corporate culture is purely the domain of large corporations and high-flying CEOs. It also implies a certain powerlessness on the part of the individual. In reality, neither could be further from the truth.\\" He goes on to reiterate that every organization of any size \\"has its own culture, and its leaders exert tremendous influence over the values that drive that culture.\\" However, each individual within any culture has the power to define the values within her or his own working environment. At least to some extent, each individual also has the power to change the current values of the organization. Of course, there are some situations which become intolerable, situations which lack both meaning and purpose for certain people.<br />Gallagher insists (and again, I agree with him completely) that, ultimately, the soul of any organization is no more and no less than the shared values of that organization as revealed in the behavior of those involved. When lists of the most admired companies are formulated, it is no coincidence that those on the list are also the most profitable within their respective industries. For each of them, culture IS strategy. Decision-makers who challenge that are among those in greatest need of what Gallagher offers -- with eloquence as well as precision -- in this book.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read Daniel Goleman's Primal Leadership, David Maister's Practice What You Preach, and Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba's Creating Customer Evangelists.\\"While corporate culture has become a fashionable term to describe the core values that drive an organization, it is also very misleading, because corporate implies that corporate culture is purely the domain of large corporations and high-flying CEOs.

Books	5	15	17	N	N	The Entrepreneur as Pilgrim	What we have here are (presumably edited) transcripts of conversations conducted by Litman during broadcasts on a small radio station on Long Island. Even on the printed page, they are lively because of Litman's exuberance and his guests' authentic enthusiasm about what they discuss. Although the guests share much in common (e.g. passion about what they do, a high energy level, an eagerness to take on new business challenges, and a delight in principled competition), each has a quite distinct personality and remarkably diverse views on what are generally referred to as \\"the secrets of success.\\"<br />I disagree with those reviewers who dismiss the interviews as an extended infomercial. True, Litman celebrates his guests' success and urges listeners to purchase the materials they have created. He thinks highly of the various books, tapes, etc. to which he refers. I have no problem with that. As I read each of the interviews, I felt as though I were listening to the conversation as broadcast on the radio. Repetitions, jumbled syntax, digressions, and emotional reactions all give the interactions with Litman an immediacy and an authenticity which few (if any) anthologies of brightly polished essays possess.<br />Here are three brief excerpts which will, I hope, give those who read this review a sufficient indication of what this volume offers to them:<br />Advice from a mentor, Earl Shoaf: \\"`Set a goal to become a millionaire for what it makes of you to achieve it. Do it for for the skills you have to learn and the person you have to become. Do it for what you'll end up knowing about the marketplace, what you'll learn about the management of time and working with people. Do it for the ability of discovering how to keep your ego in check. For what you have to learn about being benevolent. Being kind as well as being strong. What you have to learn about society and business and government and taxes and becoming an accomplished person to reach the status of millionaire is what's valuable. Not the million dollars.' That was one of the best pieces of philosophy I have ever heard in my life.\\" Jim Rohm, author of dozens of books, cassettes, and courses on success, on living a full life, on fulfilling potential.<br />On his success plan: \\"First of all, you've got to figure out what you really want. In my case and in [co-author Jack Canfield's] case, we didn't want a best-selling book. We wanted a mega best-selling book, Chicken Soup for the Soul. The clearer you are, the easier it is to execute. Number two, you put it in writing and where I differ from all my peers is, I say you must have too many goals. I've got over 6,000 in writing. Three, visualize it. What you see with your inner eye....[Jack and I] cut out the New York Times Bestseller list. Then we put our names at the top before we ever got to the top in real life. Then we put it on my mirror and we put one up at Jack's office, on his mirror. So in our mind's eye, when we were shaving or the ladies were doing cosmetics, we owned the concept that we were best-selling authors before we actually were best-selling.\\" Mark Victor Hansen, author or co-author of various Chicken Soup books as well as Dare to Win and How to Achieve Total Prosperity.<br />On business opportunities: \\"Most of the great business ideas we have seen in the last 20 or 30 years start out as a joke. People laugh at them when they first hear them. But the real business opportunities that have been created are done in areas that aren't particularly sexy, aren't particularly innovative, and aren't necessarily this new high tech wismo gismo. But what they are is someone who had a passion for something. The key or the secret: Find something that you're interested in that gets your juices flowing. That you feel passionate about....The difference between people and people who don't is the people who make it know how to recover from setbacks and recover quickly.\\" Jim McCann, CEO of 1-800-FLOWERS.com and author of Stop and Smell the Roses.<br />The appeal and value of the interviews will depend, of course, on the level of rapport which a reader has with each of Litman's nine guests. Also, to what extent each of them addresses issues and opportunities relevant to a reader's specific financial goals. For example, many readers will have no interest in creating multiple streams of income (which Robert Allen discusses) or in marketing (which Jay Conrad Levinson discusses) or in maximizing the value of a company inorder to sell it (which Michael Gerber discusses). Therefore, I strongly recommend a careful review of the Contents section in which Litman provides key points for each chapter. My guess (only a guess) is that at least one of the chapters will be worth far more than the cost of this book to almost every reader.<br />One final point. With all due respect to Litman, his book's subtitle is somewhat misleading.  Why? His guests unanimously agree that getting rich is only a destination. Their greatest pleasure is derived from completing the journey necessary to reach that destination. During their conversations with Litman, they generously share the lessons they have learned in the vineyards of free enterprise and most of these lessons were the result of their own encounters with barriers, setbacks, etc. The journey to wealth is already difficult enough.

Don't be deterred by the title and subtitle, nor by the sometimes overheated diction. (Initially, I was.) This book provides an abundance of practical strategies, tactics, and suggestions which can be of invaluable assistance to males as well as to females, to corporate marketing executives as well as to entrepreneurs. Without apologies, Ross has an in-your-face style.

She may seem playful at time but she is nonetheless quite serious about the importance of combining prudent speed with relentless determination to achieve what Jim Collins calls a BEHAG: a Big Hairy Audacious Goal. Only in recent years have women somehow overcome formidable barriers to achieve success in the business world, most of which were installed and then sustained by men. Today, at least 80% (and probably more) of the growth our nation's GNP has been achieved by companies with 20 or fewer employees and a substantial majority of those companies are owned by women.<br />This book will be of substantial benefit to those women but also to other women who need both encouragement and guidance, either to join the ranks of company owners or to expedite the progress of their careers within other organizations.

After the Foreword (\\"Leading in the New Century: Storm Clouds and Silver Linings on the Horizon\\") and Introduction (\\"Factors Affecting Leadership and Human Capital Management\\"), they organize 49 interviews within five chapters, followed by an Epilogue (\\"Optimizing Human Capital with a 'People Operating System' Approach\\"). Actually, during their research for this book, they conducted hundreds of interviews with all manner of executives, selecting responses which, to varying degrees, helped to answer questions such as these:<br />* What gives companies competitive advantage?<br />* What are the burning issues for corporate leaders today?<br />* How do leaders lead in times of crisis or instability?<br />* How do companies identify, attract, develop, and retain the best and brightest people in the marketplace?<br />The title of each chapter correctly indicates the primary focus of the interviews assembled within it: Leadership, Managing Human Capital, Establishing Competitive Advantage, Strategic change and Transformation, and finally Chapter 5, The Stakeholder's View. The value of this book will no doubt be determined by each reader in terms of the nature and extent of material most relevant to the reader's specific needs and interests. Here are brief excerpts from a few of the conversations which were of greatest interest to me. Hopefully they give those who read this review a sense of the quality of the responses to important issues.<br />Jim Collins on leadership: \\"We [Collins and his research associates] concluded that the answer to making companies great was not leadership itself. The real distinction was that there is a special form of leadership that takes companies from good to great....Level Five leaders are ambitious first and foremost for the company and its long-term greatness, not for themselves as individuals. As a result, they tend to be personally modest, humble and reserved,, but enormously willful on behalf of the organization....They tend not to become celebrities. They don't have their egos wrapped up in making themselves well-known....We found that there is an inverse relationship between high-profile, charismatic, egocentric leadership -- the Level Four leaders -- and the journey of the company from good to great.\\"<br />John Hagel on how to respond to increased performance demands, shifts of surplus from from a structural advantage to a human capital advantage, and a bottleneck to value creation caused by shortages in key skill sets/experience: \\"What can companies do about these trends? As talent increases its ability to capture value, companies will need to rethink their businesses on a profound level. This includes even the most basic question of all: What business are we in? What business are we really in? Perhaps the most significant challenge involves the need to adopt a different mindset. Rather than looking at cost-cutting and automation as ways to cope, businesses will need to focus on accelerating growth as a way to reward talent and increase returns to the business at the same time. Rather than focusing on attracting and retaining talent, companies will need to concentrate on developing privileged relationships with talent, wherever it may reside.\\"<br />Michael Dell on the New Economy: \\"The most essential trend, indeed the trend that spawned the New Economy, is the transition from atoms to electrons and now photons as a medium for information. With each of these transitions, the vehicles upon which information rides have become lighter. Thoughts, ideas, and productivity now flow with less friction than ever before, decreasing transaction costs and removing barriers to communication. As a result, it's now as simple and inexpensive to communicate a world away as it is to send a message across the room.\\"<br />David M. Rubenstein on Jack Welch's leadership: \\"When he took the helm of General Electric 20 years ago, it was a well-respected company. At the time, no one thought that GE had any significant problems, yet Welch, in a mere two decades, transformed it into a completely different organization by building on existent strengths. Now, ha he just [in italics] presided during his period and not [in italics] led, GE would still be a reasonably successful electrical appliance company. But by dramatically expanding its mission and turning it toward a path it would never otherwise have taken, he set the gold standard for business leadership. Welch will be remembered for asking questions that others hadn't asked, motivating people, asking employees to dig a little deeper and work a little harder, and giving them a sense of why that was important to them, to their families, and to their communities.\\"<br />In the Epilogue, written in collaboration with Jay A. Conger, Miles and Ashby present what they describe as a \\"new method of managing talent -- a systemic, holistic approach that leverages upside potential in the day-to-day workplace by translating it into sustainable value.\\" It is called a People Operating System (POS) and is, in effect, a human capital management team. They suggest that there are seven specific attributes to be considered when identifying leadership talent. The seven are sensible enough and the points of emphasis, insofar as the attributes are concerned, are appropriate if rather obvious. However, I was unprepared for the introduction of the POS in the Epilogue. There is no indication that the POS was significantly influenced by what was learned during the interviews, from what Miles and Ashby call \\"leadership vignettes.\\" I question the appropriateness of the Epilogue. Frankly, I had expected and would have preferred some correlations between and among the responses from those interviewed which suggest how the five chapter subjects may be separate but are also interdependent.<br />Whereas the Foreword and Introduction are eminently appropriate to the material in this volume, the Epilogue is not...at least not as Conger, Miles, and Ashby present it. Perhaps they will write another book which focuses entirely on the design, implementation, and subsequent development of a POS.When he took the helm of General Electric 20 years ago, it was a well-respected company.

This is the first of two books by Jennings which I have recently read. (The other is Less Is More.) It was written in collaboration with Laurence Haughton. The subtitle reveals their core assertion: \\"How to Use Speed as a Competitive Tool in Business.\\" Correctly, they stress the importance of using speed  to achieve and then sustain a decisive competitive advantage. They also realize that there are times for an organization to be a sprinter but other times to proceed as if in a marathon.<br />In the Prologue, Jennings and Haughton explain that they \\"began with a blank canvas. No points to prove, no axes to grind, and no one to impress. We truly wanted to figure this 'speed thing' out and boil it down into easy-to-replicate tactics.\\" They developed criteria for selecting the fastest companies and then focused on them: Charles Schwab, Clear Channel Communications, AOL, H&M, Hotmail, Telepizza, and Lend Lease. The book presents a number of real-life lessons from these high-speed companies and their full-throttle executives. The authors also provide \\"time-proven instructions on becoming faster than anyone else.\\"<br />The material is organized within four Parts: Fast Thinking, Fast Decisions, Get to Market Faster, and finally, Sustaining Speed. In their Epilogue, the authors observe that, early on in their research, they discovered that \\"truly fast companies that have demonstrated the ability to maintain momentum aren't naturally any faster than their slower-moving rivals. But they are smarter.\\" What's the difference? The truly fast companies avoid, \\"blow up,\\" or get past various \\"speed bumps,\\" refusing to be delayed or prevented from getting to where they want to be.<br />As I read this book, I began to think of an organization as a vehicle. As such, what are its requirements? First, a specific and appropriate destination. Next, a capable driver. Then, a sufficiently powerful engine and enough fuel to keep it running. Also, a transmission with different gears (including reverse), shock absorbers, and brakes. Gauges keep the driver fully informed of available fuel, oil pressure, speed, time, etc. Jennings and Haughton discuss \\"speed bumps\\" and could have just easily included a discussion of terrain and weather. A number of organizations -- S&Ls 15-20 years ago and dot coms more recently -- have failed because they could not cope with \\"rough roads\\" and \\"foul weather.\\" In several instances, imprudent speed was a factor in their demise. I want to stress this point because Jennings and Haughton do not glorify speed per se. In certain situations, however, speed is the determinant insofar as success and failure are concerned. Rapid response to customers' needs, for example, or to a new business opportunity. To extend the vehicle metaphor, executives also need a multi-gear \\"transmission\\" as well as an accelerator and brakes...and the skill to use each as well as the wisdom to know when.<br />Jennings and Haughton have a Snap! Crackle! and Pop! writing style which is eminently appropriate to the subject. They also have a delightful sense of humor which substantially increases the entertainment value of their work even as they focus on an especially serious subject: business competition in an age and at a time when it has never before been so intense and when prudent speed frequently determines the difference between organizational life or death.

However, it can stand alone on its own merits. It is also the basis of ten individual volumes in a series also written by Joy Hakim. Contrary to what other reviewers apparently think, I have no problem with the fact that the brief Foreword was co-written by George W. and Laura Bush. A close reading of this volume as well as of the ten volumes in the complementary series indicates no political bias whatsoever. Had the Foreword been written by Abraham Lincoln, would those sympathetic with the Confederate cause objected?<br />I am among those who attended public schools, grades 1-12, and whose understanding of U.S. history was based almost entirely on material in textbooks. Only later, in college and then in graduate school, did I realize how much the material in those textbooks had been sanitized. Having said that, I do not want to suggest that any of Hakim's narrative is controversial nor to suggest that the material she presents lacks authenticity. My point is, obviously, that history books can be -- indeed should be -- entertaining as well as informative. The Schamas (father and son) as well as McCullough, Edmund Morris, Ambrose, Foote, and countless other authors of bestsellers have certainly demonstrated that.<br />Following a brief Introduction, Hakim presents her material within 16 Parts, followed by the full text of \\"The Declaration of Independence\\" and then a cluster of  brief excerpts from the Constitution of the United States selected by Henry J. Abraham and Barbara A. Perry, excerpted from their book, Freedom and the Court. As already indicated, I think the text is exceptionally well-written and also congratulate the producers of this book on the inclusion of hundreds of illustrations, many of them full-color reproductions of paintings by artists such as John Trumbull, Peter Rothermel, Emanuel Leutze, John Mix Stanley, Edward Hicks, George Caleb Bingham, John Gast, Charles T. Webber, Currier & Ives, Archibald Motley, Jr., O. Louis Guglielmi, Alexandre Hogue, William Johnson, Ben Shahn, and Norman Rockwell, The reader is also provided with an abundance of archival photographs, many of which I had not previously seen.<br />It would be a mistake to characterize this volume as a \\"coffee table book.\\" True, that is where it has been placed in our living room but I hasten to add that almost all of those who visit us (including grandchildren) almost immediately pick it up and soon become engrossed in the text and illustrations. Unlike most other history books I have read over the years, I return to this one almost daily, either to read (or re-read) about a specific person and event, or, merely to browse. In another review, I will discuss the ten complementary volumes. Joy Hakim and her publisher, Oxford University Press, eminently deserve the praise they have received thus far and will continue to receive in years to come.l Leutze, John Mix Stanley, Edward Hicks, George Caleb Bingham, John Gast, Charles T.

There are several excellent books on the subject of brand management and this is one of the best. Vincent selects several of what he calls \\"legendary brands\\" and explains how each flourished through a combination of storytelling and a \\"winning market strategy.\\" These brands include Levi's, Starbucks Coffee, Absolut Vodka, Apple Computer, Nike, and Kistler Vineyards. Vincent insists that legendary brands do not depend on size, tenure, quality, and geography and reach as well as advertising and design don't matter. What does? \\"A Legendary Brand is different from other brands because it projects a sense of celebrity within its consumer base. It takes on a human persona, and attracts a following in much the same way that human celebrities do.\\" Moreover, Legendary Brands \\"stand for concepts, values, and objects that consumers use to interpret meaning in their own lives.\\" That is, they represent, indeed manifest the personality of the consumer. As a result, a Legendary Brand \\"allows consumers to order themselves in social, cultural, and personal space.\\" Each \\"is a story handed down for generations among a people, and popularly believed to have a historical basis, although not verifiable.\\"<br />Vincent introduces and then explains what he calls a Brand Mythology System. It has four components: a worldview comprised of a set of sacred beliefs, a brand agent, brand narrative (or \\"story\\"), and consumer participation through a special set of of consumer feedback activities. Frequent patrons of a local Starbucks, for example, have the same shared values as those who belong to a private club.<br />Some of the most interesting ideas are provided in Chapter 10 as Vincent examines different types of brand agents which can be persons (e.g. Hugh Hefner, Martha Stewart, and Colonel Sanders), places (e.g. Disney theme park, Sesame Street, and Augusta National Golf Club), or things (e.g. Kate Spade handbag, Mont Blanc pen, and Rolex timepiece). In each instance, the agent connects the brand with the consumer through the power of positive association: wearing Michael Jordan's brand of basketball footwear, entering the Magic Kingdom, or wearing golfwear bearing the Masters logo. Obviously, there are few Legendary Brands. However, those responsible for managing new or emerging brands as well as those attempting to revitalize established brands can learn much of value from Vincent's book by understanding his various concepts and then following the guidelines he suggests.<br />Those who share my high regard for Vincent's book are urged to check out Stephen Denning's Springboard: How Storytelling Ignites Action in Knowledge-Era Organizations, Brands: The New Wealth Creators co-edited by Susannah Hart and John Murphy, and Bernd Schmitt Experiential Marketing: How to Get Customers to Sense, Feel, Think, Act, and Relate to Your Company and Brands.brand with the consumer through the power of positive association: wearing Michael Jordan's brand of basketball footwear, entering the Magic Kingdom, or wearing golfwear bearing the Masters logo.

True, Suzanne Short does share \\"wisdom\\" received from her father, Sam Potter, wisdom which is well worth sharing. However, she addresses a number of issues which are relevant to male as well as female parents, especially single-parents. Moreover, in ways and to an extent I did not anticipate, Short shares some solid strategies and tactics by which to achieve and preserve substantial net worth.<br />What sets her book apart from those written by Suze Orman (The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom) and Thomas Stanley (The Millionaire Next Door) is its intensely personal, indeed autobiographical context. Also, as clearly indicated in her Dedication, her thoughts and feelings are anchored in a strong religious faith. According to Short, \\"This book is about parenting and conditioning. It illustrates how one parent with very limited time can exert a strong and positive influence on a child....[It] shows how an environment can be created to influence the development of a child....[and meanwhile] allow the reader to view the interplay between heredity and environment on three main topics that were the focal points of my dad's parenting: character, attitude, and money....The principles of honesty, commitment, and respect for others were themes of my dad's instruction.....Financially successful people embrace, understand, and utilize the money concepts Daddy taught me.\\"<br />Short divides her material into four sections: Who We are: Character, What We Think: Attitude, How We Survive and Thrive: Money, and The Wisdom Ends: A Eulogy & History. These are followed by five appendices (\\"Interesting Extras\\") which range from \\"HINTS for those that would be rich\\" to \\"Why the Rich Get Richer and the Poor Get Poorer.\\" Pages 333-343 summarize Short's \\"Lessons\\" which are listed in alphabetical order. Although no index is provided, the alphabetical order of lessons gives the page numbers of where to find them.<br />One of the substantial value-added benefits of this book is the abundance of quotations which Short includes. Each is eminently appropriate to the context within which it is placed. Here are five representative examples:<br />Relative to behavior: \\"Children have never been good at listening to their elders; but they have never failed to imitate them.\\" (James Baldwin)<br />Relative to being honest: \\"I always tell the truth. I cannot be bothered to lie -- You need such a good memory.\\" (Sophia Loren)<br />Relative to patience: \\"If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put foundations under them.\\" (Henry David Thoreau)<br />Relative to negative power: \\"Life doesn't reward quitting. You are the only one that does that.\\" (Phillip C. McGraw, Ph.D.)<br />Relative to success: \\"What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down.\\" (Mary Pickford)<br />Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book? As suggested earlier, I highly recommend it to male as well as female parents, especially those without a spouse. Moreover, I also recommend it to recent school and college graduates (married or single, with or without children) who lack a solid grasp of basic money management principles. They are especially vulnerable to abuse of credit cards, living from paycheck to paycheck, impulse shopping, etc. Finally, I recommend it to any others (regardless of age, gender, or circumstance) who have never had a Sam Potter in their lives and thus lack the practical wisdom needed to locate and then remain on a \\"path from poverty to prosperity.\\"s gives the page numbers of where to find them. <br />One of the substantial value-added benefits of this book is the abundance of quotations which Short includes.

I cannot be bothered to lie -- You need such a good memory.\\" (Sophia Loren)<br />Relative to patience: \\"If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put foundations under them.\\" (Henry David Thoreau)<br />Relative to negative power: \\"Life doesn't reward quitting. You are the only one that does that.\\" (Phillip C. McGraw, Ph.D.)<br />Relative to success: \\"What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down.\\" (Mary Pickford)<br />Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book? As suggested earlier, I highly recommend it to male as well as female parents, especially those without a spouse. Moreover, I also recommend it to recent school and college graduates (married or single, with or without children) who lack a solid grasp of basic money management principles. They are especially vulnerable to abuse of credit cards, living from paycheck to paycheck, impulse shopping, etc. Finally, I recommend it to any others (regardless of age, gender, or circumstance) who have never had a Sam Potter in their lives and thus lack the practical wisdom needed to locate and then remain on a \\"path from poverty to prosperity.\\"	2003-01-09

He creates a hypothetical situation in which \\"a very successful sales person\\" reflects back on his career and recalls specific people from whom he learned how to succeed. They include a wealthy and respected \\"salesman\\" who was now chairman of the board of a major corporation and several others, he explains, who also had become a One Minute Sales Person. The eager young man then seeks each out, schedules a meeting, and thereby sustains his learning process. By the end of the book, the New One Minute Sales Person receives a call from a \\"brand-new sales person\\" eager to obtain his advice. He agrees to meet with her, willing to share with her what so many others had shared with him. That in the proverbial nutshell is how  Johnson organizes his material but such a brief description cannot possibly do full justice to the value of that material.<br />It would be a disservice to both Johnson and to those who read this review to say much more about this book. (I found myself in precisely the same situation when reviewing Johnson's Who Moved My Cheese?) I highly recommend it to anyone involved in significant relationships with others. Yes, yes, I know: That includes most of the adult population on the planet Earth. Permit me to explain. The core principles which Johnson advocates are relevant to any situation in which the objective is communication (e.g. explanation and/or persuasion) or providing service to others (helping them to solve problems, fill their needs, achieve their own objectives, etc.). Moreover, I totally agree with Johnson that everyone is a sales person, that selling to one's self and to others are interdependent, and that the most important \\"pay off\\" should be measured in spiritual rather than in material terms.<br />My strong suggestion is that anyone involved with sales or customer service in any organization (regardless of size or nature) should read this book. All of the workshops I devise and conduct for my own corporate clients are based on this assumption: That it is a great privilege to serve others. Those who disagree are strongly encouraged to seek opportunities elsewhere./>My strong suggestion is that anyone involved with sales or customer service in any organization (regardless of size or nature) should read this book.

I am impressed by the nature and extent of his research, less impressed by a few of his conclusions based on that research. He notes that 61% of Americans \\"are overweight enough to begin experiencing health problems as a direct result of that weight.\\" Moreover, that \\"25% of those under 19 are overweight or obese.\\" Critser offers a biological  explanation for such alarming statistics (e.g. metabolic problems caused by increased consumption of fructose) during the emergence of what he calls a \\"new boundary-free culture\\" of self-gratification. Only in an affluent society such as ours could people afford to eat out (on average) three of every five meals when not munching on sugar- and fat-rich snack foods. Only in an affluent society such as ours could so many people afford to join and then remain a member of a fitness center.<br />Critser has done an excellent job of gathering, in a single source, so much information about these and other issues. Moderation is generally the best policy for most human activities. Perhaps after reading this book, those in urgent need of more physical exercise and/or healthier nutrition will take appropriate action. In most instances, it won't be easy. I have heard many people ask \\"Why is that everything that's so bad for me to eat tastes so good?\\" Good question. Critser is well-prepared to answer it. Even then, I suspect, the population of Fat Land will -- like most waist lines -- increase.	2003-01-08

Indeed, current circumstances in most of the countries to which she devotes her attention in this book (i.e. Bahrain, Burma, Chile, Russia, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe) suggest that quite the opposite is true. A free market democracy by nature cannot exist without a political structure which grants and protects common rights for everyone. Moreover, a free market democracy is by nature unrestrained by protectionist trade policies. I share Chua's concern for ethnic instability and violence throughout much of the world but are they not the result of decades (if not centuries) of totalitarian corruption and inefficiencies? I find it curious that Chua, a professor at Yale Law School, seems to attach so little importance to rule of law. In its absence, ethnic hatred and social instability are inevitable. Rather than enflaming them, a free market democracy offers perhaps the best means by which to alleviate them.	2003-01-07
1277775:US	51147790	R2V7YNUMAA32XM	0670899097	235723201	Dante (Penguin Lives)	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Dazzling Spirituality	This is one of several volumes in the Penguin Lives Series, each of which written by a distinguished author in her or his own right. Each provides a concise but remarkably comprehensive biography of its subject in combination with a penetrating analysis of the significance of that subject's life and career. I think this is a brilliant concept. My only regret is that even an abbreviated index is not provided. Those who wish to learn more about the given subject are directed to other sources.<br />When preparing to review various volumes in this series, I have struggled with determining what would be of greatest interest and assistance to those who read my reviews. Finally I decided that a few brief excerpts and then some concluding comments of my own would be appropriate.<br />On Dante's masterpiece: \\"The Commedia, to which the adjective Divina was affixed two centuries afterward, is, all things considered, the greatest single poem ever written; and in one perspective, as has been said, it is autobiographical: the journey of a man to find himself and make himself after having been cruelly mistreated in his homeland. It is also a rhythmic exploration of the entire cultural world Dante had inherited: classical, pre-Christian, Christian, medieval, Tuscan, and emphatically Florentine. And it is the long poetic tribute to Beatrice Portinari which Dante promised, at the end of the Vita Nuova.\\" (pages 12 and 13)<br />On Dante's response to Beatrice's death: He \\"did more than write an occasional poem of memorial grief; he put together the work to which he gave the title La Vita Nuova di Dante Alighieri. It was essentially an act of compilation, probably begun in 1293 and finished two years later. Dante drew up[ a narrative account of his relationship with Beatrice Portinari, from his first sight of her at the May Day party in 1274 to her death sixteen years later, sprinkling through it the poems -- canzones, sonnets, a ballad -- written to enshrine each successive moment.\\" (page 59)<br />On progression in the Paradiso: In it, \\"Dante ascends; he does not climb, as in the Purgatorio, but, as he is constantly remarking, is propelled upward with the speed of an arrow. He is swept up through the lower planets -- the Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Saturn; into the Fixed Stars; then upwards to the Primum Mobile, when come all distinctions of space and time, of 'where' and 'when,' through itself beyond space and time; to the Empyrean, the actual and eternal dwelling-place of the Three-in-One God, of the angels and the saints, of the community of the blessed.\\" (page 170)<br />In the concluding portion of his biography, Lewis briefly but eloquently suggests the ubiquitous and energizing presence of Dante in English and American literature, notably in the works of Shelley, Byron, Robert Browning, Rossetti, Emerson, Pound, Eliot, and Warren. According to Lewis, that presence \\"sparkles and sings and smiles like one of the spirits in Paradise.\\" The same can be said of Lewis' writing style which, in combination with his erudition, enables the modern reader to gain a greater appreciation of someone who lived more than 600 years ago but whose Comedy is as contemporary as tomorrow's sunrise.<br />As is also true of the other volumes in the \\"Penguin Lives\\" series, this one provides all of the essential historical and biographical information but its greatest strength lies in the extended commentary, in this instance by R.W.B. Lewis. He also includes a brief but sufficient \\"Bibliographical Notes\\" section for those who wish to learn more about Dante. I hope these brief excerpts encourage those who read this review to read Lewis' biography. It is indeed a brilliant achievement.page 59)<br />On progression in the Paradiso: In it, \\"Dante ascends; he does not climb, as in the Purgatorio, but, as he is constantly remarking, is propelled upward with the speed of an arrow.

Conwell (1843-1925) observed, \\"I am astonished that so many people should care to hear this story over again. Indeed, this lecture has become a study in psychology; it often breaks all rules of oratory, departs from the precepts of rhetoric, and yet remains the most popular of any lecture I have delivered in the fifty-seven years of my public life. I have sometimes studied for a year upon a lecture and made careful research, and then presented the lecture just once -- never delivered it again. I put too much work on it. But this had no work on it -- thrown together perfectly at random, spoken offhand without any special preparation, and it succeeds when the thing we study, work over, adjust to a plan, is an entire failure.\\" He then went on to explain to each audience that \\"acres of diamonds are to be found in this city, and you are to find them. Many have found them. And what man has done, man can do. [They are] are not in far-away mountains or in distant seas; they are in your own back yard if you will but dig for them.\\" These comments provide an excellent introduction to Conwell's book. As I read it, I thought about Dorothy in L. Frank Baum's The Wizard of Oz. Only after a series of adventures far from Kansas did she realize that \\"there's no place like home.\\" What Conwell has in mind involves far more than such appreciation, however. The tale he shares in this book, concerning a wealthy Persian named Ali Hafed, demonstrates that almost everything we may seek elsewhere is already in our lives and available to us.	2003-01-06

His access was direct and unlimited, serving as Churchill's personal physician until his death on January 24, 1965. According to Lord Moran, shortly after the war ended, G.M. Trevelyan strongly encouraged him to record his thoughts and feelings about Churchill as well as anecdotes which otherwise would have been lost. Thus began a process which continued until 1966, a year after Churchill's death, when Lord Moran published an 850-page memoir. Much of that volume has been reprinted in this new edition.<br />Having read and then re-read the three previously cited biographies, I already knew a great deal about Churchill's life and career. Of greatest interest to me in this volume are the anecdotes, dozens and dozens of them, which reveal Churchill the man in ways and to an extent not previously indicated by other authors. Many of these anecdotes suggest that the Churchill was an especially \\"difficult\\" patient, one almost totally lacking in patience. Over time, he had several health problems which even his epic will power could not overcome: a number of heart attacks, three pneumonias, two strokes, one abdominal operation, a hernia, deafness, and a virulent skin disease as well as countless minor ailments. Refusing to reduce (much less eliminate) his daily consumption of cigars and alcohol certainly didn't help, nor did the quick cures of quacks whom Churchill insisted on retaining. Because of quite legitimate concerns about Churchill's health, therefore, Lord Moran accompanied him on numerous trips, recording his own opinions of dozens of contemporaries such as Roosevelt, Stalin, Atlee, Eden, and Truman. These comments leave no doubt that Lord Moran was a keen observer and a shrewd judge of other people.<br />Alistair Cooke once said of Churchill that  he \\"told a listless nation it was heroic, and it became so.\\" Perhaps you are already familiar with Churchill the public figure. In this lively and informative volume, Lord Moran enables you to take Churchill's measure as (in Cooke's words) a \\"magnetic, monstrous, oddly lovable man.\\"ewd judge of other people. <br />Alistair Cooke once said of Churchill that  he \\"told a listless nation it was heroic, and it became so.\\" Perhaps you are already familiar with Churchill the public figure.

For various reasons, those who formulated the Constitution insisted on a separation of church and state as well as certain checks and balances within the federal government. What I found most interesting in Noll's book is his analysis of the transition from European Puritanism (after almost 200 years) to what could be called American Evangelism (emerging in the late-1790s) which not only allowed but indeed celebrated freedom of religion. Noll's primary subject is the evolution of American theology. He necessarily examines the historical context within which that process occurred. My only quarrel with him, probably more an honest difference of opinion than a complaint, is that he suggests -- or at least assumes -- a homogeneity in America's religious life which seems to be contradicted by what the separation of church and state made possible: religious heterogeneity protected by the Constitution and sustained by the checks and balances. Nonetheless, Noll succeeds brilliantly in explaining how and why religion was central to early-American history.	2002-12-30

Or about customer relations? Or about sales? Or about organizational growth? And now the correct answer: all of the above. What McConnell and Huba have accomplished in this single volume is truly impressive, at times stunning. They have consulted a variety of sources whom they gratefully acknowledge, such as Guy Kawasaki (who wrote the Foreword) as well as Emanuel Rosen, Richard Dawkins, Seth Godin, Joseph Pine and James Gilmore, Richard Cross and Janet Smith, and Philip Kotler. However, McConnell and Huba are to be commended for formulating and then presenting their own cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective strategies by which to create \\"customer evangelists\\" who (in effect) become \\"a volunteer sales force.\\"<br />Just within the book's first five (of 16) chapters, McConnell and Huba answer questions such as these:<br />1. What are the attributes of customer evangelists?<br />2. What are the six tenets of customer evangelism?<br />3. Why are customer evangelists the ultimate salespeople\\"?<br />4. How to begin the process of creating customer evangelists?<br />5. What is \\"Customer Plus-Delta\\" and what are its \\"ten golden rules\\"?<br />6. What must any organization do to achieve its own Customer Plus-Delta?<br />7. What are the five key lessons to be learned from Napster?<br />8. What are the five myths and realities about buzz?<br />9. Why is a meme so important?<br />10. Which helpful hints will help any organization to create its own meme?<br />Chapters 9-15 focus on HOW seven companies create \\"customer evangelists\\" who (in effect) become \\"a volunteer sales force.\\" McConnell and Huba devote a separate chapter to Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, SolutionPeople, O'Reilly &amp; Associates, the Dallas Mavericks, Build-A-Bear Workshop, Southwest Airlines, and IBM. The last chapter all by itself is well worth far more than the cost of this book. In it, \\"The Customer Evangelism Workshop,\\" McConnell and Huba review all of their key points and then suggest HOW literally any organization can (after appropriate modification, of course) use the six tenets of customer evangelism as a framework for its own initiatives. The three appendices which follow are worthy of note: Appendix A examines uses and abuses of e-mail communications, Appendix B offers \\"8 Tips on Creating an Ideavirus for Your Business,\\" and Appendix C suggests how to measure customer evangelism.<br />I think this book will be of substantial benefit to decision-makers in literally all organizations (especially those with limited resources) who agree with McConnell and Huba that anyone within or associated with a given organization can -- and should -- help to \\"translate [its] value proposition into words the prospects can understand\\" as volunteers in its sales force.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out the sources listed in a brief but adequate References section. To those excellent sources I now presume to add Theodore Levitt's The Marketing Imagination; Bernd Schmitt's Experiential Marketing: How to Get Customers to Sense, Feel, Think, Act, and Relate to Your Company and Brands; Michael Wolf's The Entertainment Economy: How Mega-Media Forces Are Transforming Our Lives; Jeffrey Shuman and Janice Twombly's Everyone Is a Customer: A Proven Method for Measuring the Value of Every Relationship in the Era of Collaborative Business; Stephen Denning's The Springboard: How Storytelling Ignites Action in Knowledge-Era Organizations; and David Maister's Practice What You Preach: What Managers Must Do to Create a High-Achievement Culture.<br />To decision-makers in larger organizations, I also highly recommend Curt Coffman and Gabriel Gonzalez-Molina's Follow This Path: How the World's Greatest Organizations Drive Growth by Unleashing Human Potential as well as Carla O'Dell's If Only We Knew What We know: The Transfer of Internal Knowledge and Best Practice.hen suggest HOW literally any organization can (after appropriate modification, of course) use the six tenets of customer evangelism as a framework for its own initiatives.

It remains for teenagers (for whom the books were written) to suggest the relevance, indeed the value of one or both to them. Obviously, he has been influenced by the opinions of his father. (That is true of all sons.) Also obvious is the fact that McGraw agrees with his father that closing the gap between potential and fulfillment is highly beneficial for anyone, regardless of age or circumstance. He is primarily interested in the gap which often develops between a teenager and her or his parents. Indeed, teenagers (as do adults) also have all manner of relationships with non-family members; those with peers can sometimes have greater influence on their values and behavior than do any others.<br />My own personal experience suggests that most of the major problems in parent-teenager relationships are caused by (a) breakdowns in communication between them which result in misunderstandings, distrust, and frustration and/or (b) diminished self-image which results in a deep and painful sense of inadequacy and, in some instances, a sense of complete failure. McGraw offers several excellent guidelines for closing various &quot;gaps&quot; while realizing, I assume, that a parent's relationship with a 13-year old son or daughter poses for each quite different challenges than does a parent's relationship with a 19-year old. These challenges are complicated by certain issues which are unique to mother-son, mother-daughter, father-son, and father-daughter. Hence the importance of effective communication to each of these four relationships during the years through which a daughter or son proceeds from 13 to 19.<br />McGraw should not be expected to provide all of the \\"right answers.\\" No longer a teenager but not yet a parent (insofar as I know), he should also not be expected to ask all the \\"right questions.\\" The value of his book will probably vary, depending on how receptive a parent or teenager is to considering a 22-year old's opinions and recommendations. My own suggestion is that the content of this book should be carefully considered on its own merit, without regard to the identify or age of its author.a parent or teenager is to considering a 22-year old's opinions and recommendations.

Or a history of leadership? Or an \\"A to Z guide to power\\"? Actually, it is all of the above. Axelrod organizes his material within 14 categories which range from Character Model to Visionary. The common denominators among the 158 different leaders' lives and careers are \\"significance of achievement and excellence of execution.\\" Each individual entry is organized according to name of subject, with birth and death dates; the leadership category (or categories) to which he or she is assigned by Axelrod; leadership achievements (a bullet list); a concise life narrative; and leadership lessons revealed in the subject's life and career. For many of the entries, Axelrod also includes key leadership quotations, \\"In His Own Words\\" or \\"In Her Own Words.\\" The 158 subjects are arranged in alphabetical order, from Abbas the Great (1571-1629) to Yang Chen (died 1604). For obvious reasons, Axelrod includes entries devoted to Alexander the Great, Winston Churchill, Elizabeth I, Mohandas Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln, Napoleon I, and George Washington.<br />Of special interest to me, however, are the entries which focus on leaders about whom I previously knew little, if anything. For example, Gnaeus Julius Agricola (37-93), \\"Brilliant Roman conqueror of Britain who wisely leavened conquest with a high degree of toleration\\"; Alfonso VIIII (1155-1214), \\"One of the great warrior-rulers of medieval Spain [who] achieved overwhelming victory against the forces of Islam on the Iberian Peninsula\\"; Stephen Decatur (1779-1820), \\"early U.S. naval leader whose skilled heroics established a naval tradition of excellence and valor\\"; and Tecumseh (ca. 1768-1813), \\"Combining charisma and persuasive reasoning, the Shawnee chief united several tribes to mount a powerful resistance to white settlement during the American Revolution, the Indian Wars of the Old Northwest, and the War of 1812.\\"<br />Axelrod has done a brilliant job of organizing and then presenting his material. There are so many different ways by which to read it. For example, entries grouped within one of the 14 categories such as Improviser (which has 21) or pairs of adversaries such as Napoleon I and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington and/or Ulysses Simpson Grant and Robert Edward Lee. Or perhaps leaders within an historical period such as that of the Roman Empire (55 B.C. to 410) or World War Two. Or perhaps only military or religious leaders; or more specifically, only American presidents.

Those inclined to challenge them would be well-advised to consider the basis of their assertions: \\"Ten million customers and over two hundred thousand managers were surveyed. More than three million employees were interviewed from 1995 through 2001. Additionally, more than two million talent-fit/role-success reviews were tallied. More than 300, 000 business units, in hundreds of organizations worldwide, took part in the study....All major industries, from fast-food chains to physicians' groups, were represented. A wide variety of job types was included, as were all kinds of customers. Industry and organizations of all sizes were integrated....Employees from different types of organizations were measured in terms of their talent, engagement, and outcomes.\\"<br />What about customers? \\"Similarly, customer data included purchase information: Volume, dollar amounts spent, repurchase intentions and behavior, brand ratings, product evaluations, opinions, and other complementary patterns of attitudes and behavior were all covered in detail.\\" Who wants to step forward to challenge the validity of Coffman and Gonzalez-Molina's assertions? Not I.<br />The subtitle of this book, \\"How the World's Greatest Organizations Drive Growth by Unleashing Human Potential,\\" is somewhat misleading. In fact, according to Coffman and Gonzalez-Molina, cultures -- not organizations -- unleash human potential which, in turn, drives organizations. More specifically, emotion-driven, highly engaged employees (\\"associates\\" at Wal-Mart and J.C. Penney) continuously nourish and thereby sustain profitable relationships with (yes) emotion-driven, highly-engaged customers. Contrary to conventional wisdom, \\"Superior performance is not the exclusive product of the rational mind. no matter how appealing it is to business to believe this is so. Talent does intelligence one better, because it combines and utilizes the full circuitry (rational and emotional) of the brain's neural connections in the endless pursuit of productive outcome.\\"<br />What about knowledge and skills? Coffman and Gonzalez-Molina duly acknowledge that they are required by quality performance. However, \\"In essence, talent and engagement are emotionally driven. In tough economic times, talent and emotional engagement are the only natural competitive advantages.\\" Emotional engagement is thus the \\"fuel\\" that drives the most productive employees (approximately 20% of any workforce) and the most profitable customers. Coffman and Gonzalez-Molina seem almost surprised by the fact that there is an unlimited supply. \\"The most amazing thing about it is that it never runs out.\\"<br />The word \\"path\\" in this book's title refers to a sequence of \\"steps\\" to be taken:<br />1. Acknowledge the role that emotion plays in driving business outcomes.<br />Comment: Keep in mind that emotions can be either positive (e.g. appreciation) or negative (e.g. resentment).<br />2. Acknowledge that all employees possess innate talents that can be emotionally engaged.<br />Comment: Workers generally do best what they enjoy doing most.<br />3. Understand that unique talent combinations lead to increased profits and growth.<br />Comment: Because needs change, different talents may be needed and in different combinations.<br />4. Understand and appreciate the power of the Q12 and accept what it can do for an organization.<br />Comment: Coffman and Gonzalez-Molina focus on the Q12 in Chapter 4 and explain how to manage the Q12 in Chapter 5.<br />5.

Unless and until that is achieved, our relationships with others will probably remain (to varying degrees) dysfunctional. To paraphrase Thoreau, many of those involved in relationships of various kinds feel trapped in \\"lives of quiet desperation.\\" Approximately half of all marriages end in divorce. Perhaps as many as 70% of all corporate mergers fail. It is probably impossible to determine how many once close friendships deteriorate or end acrimoniously. How many of these relationships could have been rescued? Presumably those who purchase McGraw's books feel a need to improve their effectiveness as human beings. In this volume, he suggests a rigorous seven-step strategy for \\"reconnecting\\" with ourselves as well as with others.<br />1. Analyze the relationship: What happened? What's wrong? What's missing?<br />2. Assume personal responsibility; eliminate consideration of \\"blame, \\"guilt,\\" etc.<br />3. Also eliminate all negative (\\"wrong\\") thoughts<br />4. \\"Embrace\\" relationship realties (\\"truths\\")<br />5. Understand and then apply the \\"Formula for Success\\" he offers<br />6. With total honesty, \\"renegotiate\\" the terms and conditions of each relationship<br />7. Then commit to sustaining mutual love and respect in harmony<br />In First, Break All the Rules, Buckingham and Coffman discuss what could be characterized as \\"business tough love.\\" They insist (and I wholly agree) that if a supervisor sincerely cares about the welfare of those for whom she or he is responsible, it is imperative to be totally honest with each of them, especially when there are unpleasant issues to resolve. Long ago, my own experience in the business world convinced me that constructive criticism has credibility only when those who offer it are respected and trusted by those who receive it. Moreover, constructive criticism is most effective only when those who receive it are convinced that those who offer it sincerely care about them.<br />McGraw presupposes that those who implement the seven-step strategy do so in good faith. In terms of the relationship with his reader, he obviously sees his function as providing no-nonsense guidance and (yes) encouragement throughout the difficult process if implementation. It is indeed a very difficult process because the most powerful of human emotions are active in dysfunctional relationships, notably love and, of course, pain. McGraw's credibility with readers has much less to do with his credentials and celebrity status, I believe, than with the fact that he speaks with a candor that is credible because it is so rare. He cares deeply about helping people to face and then cope with unpleasant realities, challenging them to have the courage to trust what is admirable within them and nourish it with total honesty in the most important relationship of all: with themselves.<br />Because so many of McGraw's ideas in this book are compellingly relevant to relationships in business, I hope he will write a book for those in the workplace and especially for those with supervisory responsibilities. It would be a mistake to distinguish between dysfunctional personal and dysfunctional professional relationships. The causes of the former are certain to be virtually the same for the latter. But to repeat the thought with which I began this review, \\"the first relationship to rescue is the one we have with ourselves. Unless and until that is achieved, our relationships with others will probably remain (to varying degrees) dysfunctional.\\" The choice is ours. It always has been and always will be.r it sincerely care about them. <br />McGraw presupposes that those who implement the seven-step strategy do so in good faith.

Who are among the greatest storytellers throughout history? My own list includes Homer, Plato, Chaucer, Aesop, Jesus, Dante, Boccaccio, the brothers Grimm, Confucius, Abraham Lincoln, Hans Christian Andersen, and most recently, E.B. White. Whatever the genre (epic, parable, fable, allegory, anecdote, etc.), each used exposition, description, and narration to illustrate what they considered to be fundamental truths about the human condition. In this volume, Denning focuses on \\"how storytelling ignites action in knowledge-led organizations\\" and does so with uncommon erudition, precision, and eloquence.<br /><br />His narrative covers a period of approximately three years during which he used what he calls \\"springboard\\" stories to \\"spark organizational change\\" at The World Bank. More specifically, to forge a consensus within that organization to support the design and then implementation of effective knowledge management, first for itself and then for its clients worldwide. How he accomplished that objective is in and of itself a fascinating \\"story\\" but the book's greater value lies in what he learned in process, lessons which are directly relevant to virtually all other organizations (regardless of size or nature) which struggle to \\"do more with less and do it faster\\" in the so-called Age of Information. Maximizing use of their collective intellectual capital is most often the single most effective way to do that.<br /><br />There are several reasons why this book impressed me so much. Here are three. First, Denning allows his reader to accompany him during the process by which he eventually overcame rigorous but subtle internal opposition to what was perceived to be a threat to the status quo at The World Bank. Second, he shares with his reader the profoundly important realization -- well along during the process -- that he needed to use a \\"springboard\\" story to win over his opposition. That is to say, practice what he had been preaching but without (until then) much success. Finally, he provides just about anything his reader needs to know inorder to use storytelling to achieve the same objectives within her or his own organization: forge a consensus of support, design and implement an internal information management program, and then extend participation and benefits to all other stakeholders, especially customers or clients as well as strategic partners.<br /><br />The comprehensive narrative (which really increases in pace and impact after Denning's \\"profoundly important realization\\") is supplemented by six appendices: Elements for Developing the Springboard Story, Some Elements for using Visual Aids in Storytelling, Elements for Performing the Springboard Story, Building Up the Springboard Story: Four Different Structures, Examples of Springboard Stories, and finally, a Knowledge Management Chart. The Bibliography which follows is brief but more than adequate. The footnotes are conveniently provided within each chapter to facilitate correlation with Denning's text and indicate the nature and extent of his erudition.<br /><br />Although Denning could probably hold his own during a workshop conducted within the highest of ivory towers, I value even more (much more) his immensely practical approach to accommodating all manner of realities such as the aforementioned opposition to his efforts within The World Bank and the importance of telling the appropriate \\"springboard\\" story to an external audience. For example, the same story which was enthusiastically received by his audience in London was met with polite silence soon thereafter by another audience in Bern.<br /><br />In this review, I have only begun to indicate the nature and extent of the invaluable wisdom and practical advice which Denning provides. Why Five Stars? Because a higher rating is not available.<br /><br />For whatever reasons, only in recent years has there been an awareness and appreciation of the importance of the business narrative. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Annette Simmons' The Story Factor, Doug Lipman's Improving Your Storytelling, and Storytelling in Organizations co-authored by John Seely Brown, Denning, Katarina Groh, and Laurence Prusak.are urged to check out Annette Simmons' The Story Factor, Doug Lipman's Improving Your Storytelling, and Storytelling in Organizations co-authored by John Seely Brown, Denning, Katarina Groh, and Laurence Prusak.	2002-12-14

Having recently re-read this book, I was not surprised that it remains at least as relevant as it was when first published in 1990. Her fondness for metaphors is evident in this brief excerpt in which she suggests correlations between Lewis Carroll's Wonderland and the global marketplace which Kanter surveyed more than a decade ago. \\"The mallet Alice uses is a flamingo, which tends to lift its head and face another direction just as Alice tries to hit the ball. The ball, in turn, is a hedgehog, another creature with a mind of its own. The wickets are card soldiers, ordered around by the Queen of Hearts, who changes the structure of the game seemingly at whim by barking out an order to the wickets to reposition themselves around the court.... Substitute technology for the flamingo, employees or customers for the hedgehog and everyone from the government regulators to corporate raiders for the Queen of Hearts and the analogy fits the experience of a growing number of companies.\\"<br />The \\"giants\\" which Kanter examines in this book include Kodak, IBM, AT&amp;T and CBS. I find it interesting that Louis Gerstner chose for the title of his recently published memoirs Who Says That Elephants Can't Dance? As he explains, IBM's culture rather than its strategy proved to be his greatest challenge when struggling to save that once great company. This is precisely what Kanter has in mind when suggesting that &quot;Whereas bureaucratic management is inherently preservation-seeking, entrepreneurial management is inherently opportunity-seeking.\\" She goes on to explain that \\"The major concern of bureaucracy is to administer a known routine uniformly, guided by past experiences, whereas the major concern of an entrepreneurial organization is to exploit opportunity wherever it occurs and however it can be done, regardless of what the organization has done in the past. The post-entrepreneurial organization brings entrepreneurial principles to the established corporation.&quot;<br />Kanter explains how even the largest of corporate \\"giants\\" can use the \\"The 4 Fs\\" (i.e. being focused, fast, friendly, and flexible) to \\"dance\\": replacing their bureaucratic culture with a post-entrepreneurial organization. As is also true of every book she wrote before and has written since this one, this volume offers that rare combination of eloquence, practicality, passion, and most important of all, compelling and enduring relevance. Obviously it will be of great value to decision makers throughout larger organizations but I also highly recommend it to owners/CEOs of smaller companies as well as to those who have recently embarked on a business career and are in need of guidance as they develop their leadership and management skills.<br />Those organizations (regardless of size or nature) which reject or ignore \\"The 4 Fs\\" seem certain to encounter a fifth: Failure.trepreneurial organization brings entrepreneurial principles to the established corporation.&quot;<br />Kanter explains how even the largest of corporate \\"giants\\" can use the \\"The 4 Fs\\" (i.e. being focused, fast, friendly, and flexible) to \\"dance\\": replacing their bureaucratic culture with a post-entrepreneurial organization.

Stated another way, had I read only the one Maxwell book each time I was composing a review of it, I would probably rate each of the Maxwell books Five Stars. They are carefully organized, well written, and thought-provoking. The same is true of this volume in which Maxwell focuses on ten heroes and heroines from the Old Testament. He suggests that each manifests an important life and leadership principle: Noah (one person can make a difference), Esther (God has a place for you), Joseph (Don't give up on your dreams), Moses (live in the \\"faith zone,\\" not the \\"safe zone\\"), Rebekah (give generously to others), Abraham (God always does the right thing), Nehemiah (no problem is too big when you have help), The Servant Girl (one small act can make a big difference), David (you can overcome the limitations others put on you), and finally Jonathan (strengthen a leader and save a nation). Maxwell devotes a chapter to each and concludes with a \\"Discussion Guide\\" based on the material provided in the given chapter.<br />It is easy to list the names of the heroines and heroes, and, to list also the life and leadership principle each embodies. Far more difficult, obviously, to correlate their ancient cultures with our own. That is precisely Maxwell's point: However different cultures and individual circumstances may be, there really are some enduring values which are relevant to each. After I read this book, I was prompted to ask questions such as these. Have not contemporaries such as Gandhi made a difference? Was it not Mother Teresa's mission in life to give generously to others? Did Martin Luther King, Jr. ever give up on his dream? Were Gandhi, King, Sadat, and Rabin (to name but four) in a \\"safe zone\\" or a \\"faith zone\\" when assassinated?<br />To varying degrees, ancient as well as contemporary heroes and heroines demonstrate in their lives and in their leadership of others the same principles and values which Maxwell affirms all of his many books. This one is different from the others in that it attracts our attention to ten individuals most of whom we seldom think about, much less appreciate, and from whom we can learn much of value if our hearts as well as our minds are both willing and able.heroines demonstrate in their lives and in their leadership of others the same principles and values which Maxwell affirms all of his many books.

That's certainly true of our relationships with others and especially true of the relationship we have with ourselves. Phillip McGraw is only the most recent of countless media celebrities such as Bishop Fulton Sheen, Esther Lederer (\\"Ann Landers\\"), Pauline Van Buren (\\"Abigail Van Buren\\"), Joyce Brothers, Ruth Westheimer, and Laura Schlessinger. My hunch (only a hunch) is that their staunchest admirers are those who have made the greatest effort to apply in their own lives what these popular psychologists have advocated. Second hunch (only a hunch): Many of those most critical of them are (at worst) envious of their fame whereas others are concerned that complicated problems will be trivialized by what they view as simplistic solutions.<br />McGraw may be the most controversial of them all because he seems to be (intentionally) the most confrontational of them all. This is the latest of several books he has written. In it, he insists that self-esteem really matters and explains why.  That got me to thinking again about The Golden Rule. More specifically, about all of the recent inhumanities (other than acts of terrorism) which the media have publicized so extensively. It seems logical to me to assume that if people are consumed by self-loathing, they will be following The Golden Rule when they \\"do unto others\\" as they would have others \\"do unto them.\\" Is not most dysfunctional behavior directly or indirectly related to self-esteem problems? Of course self matters! It matters a great deal. In many situations, it could quite literally determine matters of life or death.<br />In this volume, McGraw answers two questions of special importance to me. First, what must I do to increase my self-esteem and then sustain at the highest possible level? Also, how can I be most helpful to others who do not a high level of self-esteem? It would be a disservice to both McGraw and those who read this review to indicate what I think his answers are but I will say that the first answer places full responsibility on me...and on no one else. Period. No news there, you say? Not so fast. The book's subtitle is \\"Creating Your Life from the Inside Out.\\" Easy to say. (I think he means Re-Creating\\" rather than \\"Creating.\\")  Think about it. What will it take to get \\"inside\\"? He seems to ask: How much time and effort, concentration and determination, patience amidst frustration and discomfort are you willing to commit? More to the point, how serious ARE you?<br />Obviously, McGraw cannot make that journey for us. (No one can.) But he can certainly help to prepare us for what awaits. Hence the importance of three questions he asks his reader to answer. Thus far,<br />1. What have been the ten (10) most defining moments of your life?<br />2. What were the seven (7) most critical choices you have made to place you on your current path?<br />3. Who have been the five (5) most pivotal people in your life and how have they shaped you?<br />Try answering these three questions (with total honesty, of course) before you read the book. Then review your answers after you read the book. To reiterate, whether or not you buy and then read the book, the value you derive from this exercise will wholly depend on how much you invest in it. And that, McGraw insists, is also true of your life.<br />Where can you find the answers you seek to your questions? Where can you find the solutions to your problems?

They have more to do with his political strategies and tactics than with his values. No reasonable person questions his fervent patriotism. He loves his country and takes great (and justifiable) pride in the fact that he has served it so faithfully as a naval officer and then as an elected public official. Perhaps \\"regrets\\" is more accurate than \\"self-doubts.\\" As McCain himself acknowledges, he has been since his childhood a maverick, possessing what is often referred to as an \\"attitude.\\" His physical courage is well-documented. But there are legitimate disagreements about his personality. For example, is he stubborn or does he have non-negotiable principles? Is he hot tempered or passionate? Is he impatient or eager to get results? (My hunch is that McCain would say \\"Yes\\" to all of the above.) Inevitably, memoirs are both selective and subjective and this volume is no exception. I wish McCain had shared more about his \\"take\\" on various political campaigns, especially his when seeking the Presidential nomination of his party. I also wish he had revealed more about his involvement with Keating. However, I am grateful for what he does provide. I have no doubt McCain wrote this book. Its tone and diction are wholly consistent with his public statements and appearances. I am among those who are weary of political correctness when it \\"homogenizes\\" political dialogue. McCain's direct and candid voice needs to be heard. With a Republican in the White House and with a Republican majority in both the Senate and House, perhaps some of the reforms which McCain seeks (notably that of campaign finance) will eventually be achieved. One final point: His recent appearance on Saturday Night Live suggests a self-deprecating sense of humor which I hope he will cultivate. Who knows? Perhaps inspired by Mark Twain and Will Rogers, McCain will now wage those battles \\"worth the fighting for\\" with a wit few other public officials seem to possess.Twain and Will Rogers, McCain will now wage those battles \\"worth the fighting for\\" with a wit few other public officials seem to possess.	2002-12-07

What I found most illuminating in Bradsher's book is his analysis of the the vehicle's social, economic, and political history during the last 60 years. The current S.U.V. \\"boom\\" is undeniable. How to explain it? The S.U.V. contradicts recent movements to reduce air pollution while increasing traffic safety. Why and how has that been possible? What does the appeal of the S.U.V. to so many different people reveal about contemporary values? These are among the questions to which Bradsher responds and his answers are thought-provoking, at times upsetting.<br />According to his account, very powerful forces in \\"Washington\\" and \\"Detroit\\" (used as generic terms just as \\"Hollywood\\" is used elsewhere) have achieved legislation which is beneficial both to those who sell and to those who purchase S.U.V.s. Bradsher argues that various concessions (e.g. luxury tax exemptions) are not in the general public's interest. No one denies the economic power of S.U.V.s: A single Ford factory in Michigan produced $11-billion in annual S.U.V. sales which is about equal to McDonald's global sales. But how safe are they? How cost-efficient are they? Bradsher's answers to these questions help to explain his comment that \\"Perhaps the saddest part of the S.U.V. boom is that it has been so unnecessary.\\"<br />A recent traffic accident in a suburb of Dallas resulted in the deaths of several teenagers in an S.U.V. Whether or not the accident is alcohol-related is a matter yet to be determined. I mention it because media coverage revealed what I had not previously known: Those employed by municipal and state agencies are required to complete special training before being allowed to drive larger S.U.V.s. As one deputy fire chief explained, \\"You simply can't drive the [name of large S.U.V.] the same way you drive a sedan. It's much too dangerous, especially when you have to make a quick maneuver.\\" This single traffic accident proves nothing but the need for special training (at least to drive larger S.U.V.s) is for me indicative of an issue which has not as yet received the public attention it deserves.<br />Whether or not Bradsher's book has much impact remains to be seen. My guess is that \\"the world's most dangerous vehicles\\" will continue to be among the most popular (and most profitable) vehicles sold. Thanks to Bradsher's book, I now understand \\"how they got that way.\\" No doubt I will continue to ride in S.U.V.s driven by family members. Also, I will continue to feel intimidated by other S.U.V.s (as I am by tractor trailers) when surrounded by them in traffic. And yes, I will resent those whose S.U.V.s take up so much room that smaller vehicles (such as mine) cannot squeeze in next to them in most parking lots.us, especially when you have to make a quick maneuver.\\" This single traffic accident proves nothing but the need for special training (at least to drive larger S.U.V.s) is for me indicative of an issue which has not as yet received the public attention it deserves.<br />Whether or not Bradsher's book has much impact remains to be seen.

Also, I will continue to feel intimidated by other S.U.V.s (as I am by tractor trailers) when surrounded by them in traffic. And yes, I will resent those whose S.U.V.s take up so much room that smaller vehicles (such as mine) cannot squeeze in next to them in most parking lots.	2002-11-29
1323543:US	51147790	R2MQ2G0SGD503M	0786865482	544357348	Life Strategies: Doing What Works, Doing What Matters	Books	5	21	22	N	Y	A &quot;Tool Box&quot; for Living	This is the first of several books in which McGraw introduces essentially the same core concepts which inform and direct his presentation of material in Relationship Rescue: A Seven-Step Strategy for Reconnecting with Your Partner and the most recently published Self Matters: Creating Yourself from the Inside Out. In our personal lives as in our workplace situations, I believe that strategies function as \\"hammers\\" and tactics function as \\"nails.\\" Moreover, to extend these metaphors by adding a third, each of us needs a \\"tool box\\" to solve problems. The more and better \\"tools\\" we have available, and the more adept we are when using any of them, the more effective we will be. But if the only tool we have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. If we have only one strategy....You get the idea.<br />In this volume, McGraw identifies what he calls the \\"Ten Laws of Life.\\" In his opinion, each is a reality which we deny or ignore at our peril. He suggests a specific strategy by which to cope with each of the ten \\"laws.\\" For example:<br />Life Law #4: You cannot change what you do not acknowledge.<br />Strategy: Get real with yourself and everybody in it.<br />Comment: Words are very important. Note that McGraw uses the word \\"acknowledge\\" rather than \\"recognize,\\" \\"understand,\\" \\"accept,\\" etc. How many times have you cited a painful reality inorder to help someone else solve a problem of some kind, only to be told \\"I know...I know...\\"? Unless and until that person \\"gets real,\\" the problem will remain and probably become worse.<br />Here is another example:<br />Life Law #5: Life rewards action.<br />Strategy: Make careful decisions and then pull the trigger.<br />I am reminded of the fact that Dante reserved the last and worst ring in Hell for those who, in a moral crisis, preserved their neutrality. We almost never have all the information we need nor enough time to prepare to make a decision, especially in a crisis. (The Chinese word for \\"crisis\\" has two meanings: peril and opportunity.) McGraw's proposed strategy is proactive. His use of the word \\"careful\\" implies prudence. But at some point, we must \\"pull the trigger\\": DO THE VERY BEST WE CAN in the given circumstances.<br />This book's subtitle places appropriate emphasis on practicality and value. In this book and in his others, McGraw offers no-nonsense advice to help others become most effective when undertaking initiatives of greatest importance to them. He seems to agree with Bossidy and Charan's primary assertions in Execution: The Discipline of Getting results. Each of the strategies which McGraw proposes requires self-discipline to  achieve the desired \\"results.\\" Consider:<br />Life Law #3: People do what works.<br />Strategy: Identify the payoffs that drive your behavior and that of others.<br />Comment: It is often said that people fear change. I disagree. I think what they fear is the unknown. The most effective change agents are those who help others to understand the proposed change and (more importantly) to understand why it will be of substantial benefit to them. Stated another way, the most effective change agents nourish rather than threaten others' self-interests.<br />Earlier in this review, I presumed to suggest some metaphors (i.e. hammer, nail, tool box) which seem to me relevant to McGraw's purposes. Now I ask you pretend that you have entered McGraw's Hardware Store. He greets you at the door. You indicate that you have all manner of questions to answer...all manner of problems to solve...and need some help. \\"Let me show you what I have,\\" he replies. For the next hour or so, he takes you on a personal tour of his store, explaining along the way what is available, what the functions and features of various items are, which skills are required, and finally, how and why the items could be helpful to your needs.<br />Which items do you add to your personal tool box? That is for you to decide. How carefully and conscientiously will you then use your \\"hammers,\\" \\"nails,\\" and other \\"tools\\"? Again, that is up to you. With the force of his personality and his \\"straight talk,\\" McGraw has done just about all he can. The rest is up to you. It really cannot be otherwise, can it?<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read McGraw's previously mentioned works. To business executives, I also highly recommend David Maister's Practice What You Preach: What Managers Must Do to Create a High-Achievement Culture and David Whyte's The Heart Aroused: Poetry and the Preservation of the Soul in Corporate America. However phrased, the \\"laws\\" which McGraw discusses are at least as important in the business world as they are in all other areas of human experience.rs,\\" \\"nails,\\" and other \\"tools\\"?

They share their reactions to and perspectives on the tragic events of September 11. All of the selections have been brilliantly edited by Ulrich Baer. In his eloquent Introduction, he quotes Don DeLillo's suggestion that the task at hand was \\"to give memory, tenderness and meaning to all that howling space\\" caused by the towers' collapse. These selections are indeed what Baer characterizes as \\"110 passages through silence to the first stirrings of a story, to the instant when event becomes tale, when loss gives rise to words.\\" He adds that New York \\"lives and feeds on its stories, creates tall tales, half-lies and mythologies about itself on which its future depends.\\" The 110 \\"gripping stories\\" offer what he aptly characterizes an \\"accidental juxtaposition\\" of adjacent but otherwise unrelated human lives.<br /><br />I presume to suggest that the book be read as an extended narrative, experienced as one would during a series of brief but lively conversations with strangers along a street in Manhattan. (Yes, yes, I know. Getting even one stranger in that bustling borough to converse is never easy. For present purposes, pretend otherwise.) Some works are more personal than others. Some are more directly responsive to the specific events than are others. Collectively, however, they serve as the literary equivalent of a CAT scan applied to the heart, mind, and soul of a battered but uniquely resilient and articulate urban culture. In a word, Manhattan.	2002-11-27

Such personal accounts are by nature selective and subjective. Fair enough. However, what I found disingenuous is Hamburg's ambivalent attitude toward Stone: On frequent occasion, he lavishly praises Stone as a filmmaker and seems almost desperate to ingratiate himself with him, to obtain his approval and even his praise; in other instances, he savages him as a womanizer, dope addict, and egomaniac. Were a film made based on this book, I see Stone playing himself and Hamburg played by an actor such as Tobey Maguire or perhaps Macaulay Culkin. After having read this book, I concluded that Stone is probably neither as admirable nor as corrupt as Hamburg presents him...and that Hamburg is neither as innocent nor as as venal as he (perhaps unknowingly) presents himself. I'm left wondering what Nathaniel West and Evelyn Waugh would have to say if they were to review this book.	2002-11-26

What Magretta offers (with the substantial assistance of Nan Stone) is, in my opinion, the best single-volume introduction to what Magretta refers to as \\"the discipline of management,\\" a subject which is relatively new (i.e. mid-19th century) and, until Drucker's The Practice of Management (1954), not generally understood. According to Magretta, it is \\"one of the transforming innovations of modern civilization.\\" I agree with her that management's \\"real genius is transforming complexity and specialization into performance.\\" (This precisely what Bossidy and Charan had in mind while writing Execution: The Discipline of Getting Results.) Magretta's goal is to \\"present a coherent view of the whole, of the work known as [in italics] general management.\\" Her purpose is to explain \\"the underlying [in italics] why of both the theory and practice of management....Our mission is to see the forests for the tees, and present what can be complex ideas simply, but not simplistically. We will present a sense of how management thinking has evolved and how the big ideas relate to one another.\\"<br />Magretta and Stone succeed brilliantly. They carefully consider various subjects which include value creation, business models, \\"the logic of superior performance,\\" organizational parameters, \\"which numbers matter and why\\" (the real bottom line), innovation amidst uncertainty, using focus to achieve results, and those values which are most effective when managing others. I think this volume will be especially valuable to relatively inexperienced executives. However, any decision-maker in any organization (regardless of size or nature) will find an abundance of information,  useful observations, and practical suggestions which can guide, direct, and enrich their performance. I just hope this book attracts the readership it so eminently deserves. More to the point, as presumably Magretta would concur, I hope it can help to nourish and enhance business acumen at a time when the need for \\"discipline\\" in management has never been more urgent.the point, as presumably Magretta would concur, I hope it can help to nourish and enhance business acumen at a time when the need for \\"discipline\\" in management has never been more urgent.	2002-11-26

He teams up with her again in this book, expanding and enriching his concept of leadership development at all levels throughout any organization, regardless of its size or nature. Hence the importance of what Tichy calls a \\"Virtuous Teaching Cycle\\": Everybody teaches and everybody learns; all practices, processes, and values promotion teaching; all teaching is interactive to generate the effective exchange of knowledge; thereby, maximum use is made of everyone's skills and talents to ensure all-level alignment for smart and rapid response to needs, problems, opportunities, etc. Tichy asserts (and I agree) that hypertransformation (in established organizations) and hypergrowth (in start-ups) are essential to business success. The challenge in established organizations is to overcome what Jim O'Toole characterizes as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" For start-ups, the challenge is to achieve appropriate scale while ensuring that new employees are brought on line and up to speed ASAP. In ten chapters, and with prevision as well as eloquence, Tichy explains how various organizations (notably GE) have met those and other challenges.<br />Unlike other authors who address many of the same issues, Tichy also includes a substantial Handbook (pages 285-394) which consists of ten Sections: The Teaching Organization, The Hand You have Been Dealt, Building Your Teachable Point of View, Pulling It All Together, Building a Team Timetable Point of View, Architecting the Leadership Pipeline, Scaling the Teaching Organization, Building Teaching into the DNA, Global Citizenship, and finally, Start the Journey. In the Handbook, Tichy explains provides decision-makers with with just about everything their need to know to design, implement, and then strengthen their own Teaching Organization, one within which the Virtuous Teaching Cycle sustains leadership development at all levels.<br />In his Introduction to the Handbook, Tichy quotes a brief statement from Thomas Stewart's most recent book, The Wealth of Knowledge:<br />\\"The knowledge economy stands on three pillars. The first: Knowledge has become what we buy, sell, and do. It is the most important factor of production. The second pillar is a mate, a corollary to the first: Knowledge assets -- that is, intellectual capital -- have become more important to companies than financial and physical assets. The third pillar is this: To prosper in this new economy and exploit these newly vital assets, we need new vocabularies, new management techniques, and new strategies. On these three pillars rest all the new economy's laws and its profits.\\"<br />Tichy includes this brief statement because it is directly relevant to his own objectives in The Cycle of Leadership but also because, unless and until an organizations has all three pillars (not one, not two but all three), it cannot survive major challenges which await them, many of which have yet to be revealed. That is to say, the Teaching Organization can only be built on the foundation they provide.<br />\\"Winning leaders are teachers, and winning organizations do encourage and reward teaching. But there is more to it than that. Winning organizations are explicitly designed to be Teaching Organizations, with business processes, organizational structures, and day-to-day operating mechanisms all built to promote teaching.\\" However, Tichy doesn't stop there. More importantly, the teaching that takes place is a distinctive kind of teaching. It is interactive, two-way, even multi-way. Throughout the organization, `teachers' and `students' at all levels teach and learn from each other, and their interactions create a Virtuous Teaching Cycle that keeps generating more learning, more teaching, and the creation of new knowledge.\\"<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Peter M. Senge's The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization (1990) and The Dance of Change: The Challenges of Sustaining Momentum in Learning Organizations (1999), William Isaacs' Dialogue and the Art of Thinking Together: A Pioneering Approach to Communicating in Business and in Life (1999), Carla O'Dell's If Only We Knew What We Know: The Transfer of Internal Knowledge and Best Practice (1998), and Thomas H.

First, she placed her primary objective in clear focus: to explain \\"how entrepreneurs earned customers' trust.\\" Next, she limited her attention to only six. Finally, she then examined them within an historical context from the late-18th century until the present time. As Koehn observes, \\"Before 1750,...most Britons ate off wood or pewter plates. Then came Josiah Wedgwood. In antebellum America, the majority of women made their own pickles. Then came Henry Heinz. Until the Civil War, urban retailing was a specialized activity with a wide variety of small shops offering particular kinds of goods. Then came department store entrepreneurs such as Marshall Field.\\" It is important to stress that Koehn is a biographer and cultural historian only to the extent that the material she provides helps to advance the narrative of her core themes: how six individual entrepreneurs dealt with the \\"imperatives\\" to quality goods at reasonable prices, communicate the virtues of her or his products to potential buyers in effective ways and thereby maintain and grow a viable customer base, and, how to develop organizational capabilities to learn about their respective customers and then earn their trust.<br />Before 1945, Koehn observes, \\"few American women wore premium lipstick or facial creams, and those who did [when they could] bought them in beauty shops along with elaborate treatments administered by trained cosmeticians. Then came Estee Lauder. Prior to the late 1970s, Americans bought ground coffee mostly in one-pound cans sold in supermarkets and supplied by large food processors. Then came [Howard Schultz and] Starbucks. Before 1980, most businesses used only typewriters and copy machines for paperwork. Large companies relied on mainframe and midsize computers to handle extensive calculations and data processing. Only a small number of households owned a personal computer or printer. Few if any of these users expected to be able to specify a particular computer's configuration. Then came Apple, IBM, Compaq, and Michael Dell.\\" It is also important to stress that each of the six entrepreneurs whom Koehn discusses fully understood what rapid social and economic change in their respective era meant for consumers' needs and desires. Moreover, as she carefully explains, all six used their knowledge of both the supply and demand sides of the prevailing economy to create high-quality goods,, meaningful brands, and other connections with customers...\\" and they built elite organizations that worked to [in italics] satisfy and then [in italics] anticipate buyers' changing preferences.\\"<br />In Chapter 1, Koehn provides a brilliant overview on \\"Entrepreneurs and Consumers,\\" then devotes an entire chapter to each of the six entrepreneurs. In her final chapter, she shifts her attention to \\"Historical Forces and Entrepreneurial Agency,\\" followed by 104 pages of notes. In that final chapter, Koehn points out that the six entrepreneurs \\"lived and worked in different contexts. Yet they all shared a powerful gift: the ability to discern how economic and social change affected consumer needs and wants. They also understood that these demand-side shifts presented critical business opportunities -- opportunities that each exploited by creating new, best-of-class goods and strong brands.\\" She goes on to suggest that they were \\"institution builders who were not interested in riding the wave of a short-lived trend or forcing their young brands on buyers. They wanted to [in italics] earn consumers' trust and keep it.\\"<br />It remains to seen which entrepreneurs emerge during the next few years but it seems certain that they will also encounter \\"economic and social change affected consumer needs and wants\\" and in a global marketplace yet to be developed. There is much that they -- and we -- can learn from Josiah Wedgwood, H.J. Heinz, Marshall Field, EsteeLauder, Howard Schultz, and Michael Dell. Thanks to Nancy Koehn, those \\"lessons\\" are provided in a single volume, one which will continue to be of interest and value for decades to come.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read Wolf's The Entertainment Economy, Schmitt's Experiential Marketing, Gobe's Emotional Branding, Gilmore and Pine's The Experience Economy, and Brands: The New Wealth Creators co-edited by Hart and Murphy.Lauder, Howard Schultz, and Michael Dell.

In this remarkably candid and compelling account, he shares his thoughts and feelings about a distinguished family heritage. His grandfather and father were the first father and son to be promoted to the rank of admiral in the U.S. Navy. He was nearly expelled from the U.S. Naval Academy and never achieved the rank of admiral. In 1967, his carrier-based jet fighter was shot down and he was imprisoned as a POW in North Viet Nam. For the next several years he was subjected to vicious physical as well as mental abuse by his captors. Somehow, probably with sheer willpower, he survived while so many others did not. He kept the faith of his fathers. (I think the title of this volume also refers to a new nation's Founding Fathers.) This volume does not include discussion of his subsequent political career which McCain covers in the recently published second volume of his memoirs, Worth the Fighting For. He seems to have been a battler most of his life; along the way, he developed a profound faith in the values of a country he has served so vigorously. Many of his fellow citizens really don't know what to make of him. Perhaps this volume will help at least some of us to understand his motives and the basis for them. Whatever a reader may think of McCain's politics and of his methods for advancing them, no one can deny his patriotism. With this volume, he reveals his humanity in ways and to an extent no one else could.	2002-11-25

I have long admired Gardner's work, especially his research on multiple intelligences which he discusses in other works such as Intelligence Reframed (2000), Frames of Mind (1993), and Multiple Intelligences (also 1993). As Gardner explains in the Preface, this volume\\" represents both a culmination and a beginning: a culmination in that it brings together my lifelong interests in the phenomena of creativity and the particulars of history; a beginning in that introduces a new approach to the study of human creative endeavors, one that draws on social-scientific as well as humanistic traditions.\\" Specifically, this \\"new approach\\" begins with the individual but then focuses both on the particular \\"domain,\\" or symbol system, in which an individual functions and on the group of individuals, or members of what Gardner calls the \\"field,\\" who judge the quality of the new work in the domain.<br />This is the approach he takes when analyzing the lives and achievements of Freud, Einstein, Picasso, Stravinsky, Eliot, Graham, and Gandhi. Throughout the book, Gardner makes brilliant use of both exposition (e.g. analysis, comparison and contrast) and narration (especially when examining causal relationships of special significance) to reveal, explain, and evaluate each of the seven geniuses.<br />Gardner sets for himself several specific objectives:<br />* \\"First, I seek to enter into the worlds that each of the seven figures occupied during the period under investigation -- roughly speaking, the half century from 1885 to 1935.&quot;<br />* \\"In so doing, I hope to illuminate the nature of their own particular, often peculiar, intellectual capacities, personality configurations, social arrangements, and creative agendas, struggles and accomplishments.\\"<br />* Also, \\"I seek conclusions about the nature of the Creative Enterprise writ large. I believe that if we can better understand the breakthroughs achieved by the individuals deliberately drawn from diverse domains, we should be able to tease out the principles that govern creative human activity, wherever it arises.\\"<br />* Finally, &quot;I seek conclusions about the sparkling, if often troubled, handful of decades that I term `the modern era'...Such a selection [of the seven during the half-century period] allows me to comment not only on [their] particular achievemnents...but also on the times that formed them, and that they in turn helped to define.\\"<br />Gardner achieves all of these objectives while somehow maintaining a delicate balance between respecting (indeed celebrating) individual genius and explaining the relevance (to each of the seven) of three relationships which are common to them all: the relationship between what he calls the \\"child\\" and the \\"master\\" throughout human development; the relationship between an individual and the work in which he or she is engaged; and finally, the relationship between the individual and other persons in his or her world.<br />Of special interest to me is Gardner's acknowledgment that two themes emerged during the course of his research for this book which he had not anticipated when he began. Citing a \\"confidant\\" relationship with Fleiss from whom Freud received \\"sustenance\\" when he needed it most, Gardner gradually realized that a relationship of this kind, \\"far from being an isolated case,\\" represents the \\"norm\\" among the other six.  Besso played much the same role for Einstein, Braque for Picasso, the Diaghilev circle for Stravinsky, Pound for Eliot, Horst for Graham, and Anasyra Sarabhai for Gandhi.<br />Gardner cites what he calls \\"the Faustian bargain\\" as the second theme which emerged unexpectedly during his research. This subject is much too complicated to be summarized in a review such as this. Suffice to note now that inorder to maintain their gifts and continue their work, the seven creators \\"went through behaviors or practices of a fundamentally superstitious, irrational, or compulsive nature,\\" thereby sacrificing normal relationships with family members and friends. \\"The kind of bargain may vary, but the tenacity with which it is maintained seems consistent.\\" I intend to keep these two themes in mind when I re-read this extraordinary book.actices of a fundamentally superstitious, irrational, or compulsive nature,\\" thereby sacrificing normal relationships with family members and friends. \\"The kind of bargain may vary, but the tenacity with which it is maintained seems consistent.\\" I intend to keep these two themes in mind when I re-read this extraordinary book.	2002-11-21

Robert Oppenheimer, Robert Maynard Hutchins, Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., George C. Marshall, Pope John XXIII, Eleanor Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, Jr., Margaret Thatcher, Jean Monnet, and Mahatma Gandhi.<br />As Gardner observes in his Introduction: \\"Our understanding of the nature and processes of leadership is most likely to be enhanced as we come to understand better the arena in which leadership necessarily occurs -- namely, the [in italics] human mind. Perhaps this characterization should be pluralized as [in italics] human minds, since I am concerned equally with the mind of the leader and the minds of the followers (whom I sometimes refer to as [in italics] audience members or [in italics] collaborators). Accordingly, this book is a sustained examination, first, of the ways in which leaders of different types achieve varying degrees of success in characterizing and resolving important life issues in their own minds and, second, of how, in parallel or in turn, they attempt to alter the minds of their various audiences to effect desired changes.\\"<br />What we have here is a sequence of absolutely brilliant analyses of 11 exceptional leaders in quite diverse fields of engagement. As he did in Creating Minds (when analyzing the lives and achievements of Freud, Einstein, Picasso, Stravinsky, Eliot, Graham, and Gandhi), Gardner somehow maintains a delicate balance when respecting (indeed celebrating) the unique genius of leadership of Mead, Oppenheimer, Hutchins, Sloan, Marshall, Pope John XXIII, Roosevelt, King, Thatcher, Monnet, and Gandhi while at the same time explaining how each used the linguistic as well as non-linguistic resources at her or his disposal when attempting to communicate with and thereby convince others of \\"a particular view, a clear vision of life. The term story [in italics] is the best way to convey this point.\\"<br />For Gardner, the story is \\"a basic cognitive form; the artful creation and articulation of stories [or messages] constitutes a fundamental part of the leader's vocation. Stories speak to both parts of the human mind -- its reason and emotion. And I suggest, further, that it is [in italics] stories of identity -- narratives that help individuals think about and feel who they are, where they come from, and where they are headed -- that constitute the single most powerful weapon in the leader's literary arsenal.\\"<br />It is worth noting that, since the publication of this book, Gardner has become increasingly aware of the importance of understanding and grappling with the \\"counter-stories\\" that often loom so large in the minds of the audience.  The most effective leaders understand the counter-story and address effectively the questions it raises. As indicated to those who visit Gardner's GoodWork Web site, his on-going studies of intelligence, creativity, and leadership are all conducted in an amoral way-- that is, human capacities can be used for good or ill. For example, Mandela vs Milosevic.  Gardner is now trying to understand how human intelligence(s) and creativity can be yoked to serve the wider good.<br />In Part I of this book, Gardner establishes a framework for leadership, then (in Part II) shifts his attention to case studies which focus on nine of the eleven leaders; In Part III, he focuses on Monnet and Gandhi who illustrate \\"leadership that looks forward.\\" In the final chapter, Gardner reviews \\"lessons from the past\\" and then suggests \\"implications for the future.\\" I am grateful for the two appendices which follow: a chart which presents \\"The Eleven Leaders Viewed along Principal Dimensions of Leadership\\" and another chart on which Gardner records brief comments on ten \\"Leaders of the Second World War.\\" Those in need of recommended sources for further study are provided with an extensive Bibliography.<br />The eleven men and women whom Gardner discusses in this book do indeed comprise an unusual combination.

The leaders' voices affected their worlds, and, ultimately, our world.\\" For me, it is essentially irrelevant how many persons comprise such a group nor do I have a quarrel with any of those whom Gardner selected. All are eminently worthy. Gardner has his own thoughts as to what lessons can be learned from their lives, of course, but it remains for each reader to make her or his own determination of that. Thanks to Gardner, there is a wealth of information to consider when doing so. He is indeed a brilliant teller of \\"stories.\\"<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read Gardner's earlier work, the aforementioned Creating Minds.

All are eminently worthy. Gardner has his own thoughts as to what lessons can be learned from their lives, of course, but it remains for each reader to make her or his own determination of that. Thanks to Gardner, there is a wealth of information to consider when doing so. He is indeed a brilliant teller of \\"stories.\\"<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read Gardner's earlier work, the aforementioned Creating Minds. Moreover, because they are not included among the works listed in the Bibliography, I presume to recommend, also, Albert Borgmann's Holding On to Reality and Gerald M. Edelman's Bright Air, Brilliant Fire.	2002-11-21

For that reason, this  book's subtitle (\\"Web Globalization Strategies\\") caught my eye but I did not know quite what to expect as I began to read it.  In the Introduction, Yunker explains precisely what the book is -- and is not -- about. Here is a brief excerpt:<br />\\"We live in a world of many languages, many cultures, and many countries, yet we all share one Internet. Initially, English dominated the Internet because English speakers dominated the Internet. Today, more than half of all Internet users are not native-English speakers.<br />\\"Want to increase your potential online audience by 200 million people? Create French, Italian, German, and Spanish web sites. Add Japanese and Chinese, and you'll gain another 200 million -- without opening a single international office. Web globalization will open your organization to virtually unlimited opportunities, but also many risks. This book offers guidelines and suggestions for bridging the borders between languages, cultures, countries, and ultimately, people.\\"<br />Yunker carefully organizes his material within seven Parts, with Part VII (\\"Appendices\\") consisting of an in-depth glossary and reference section. He also provides a listing of country codes, language codes, and character sets as well as a chart which explains the significance of various colors around the world. In Parts I through VI, Yunker answers questions which include:<br />* What are the basics of Web globalization (e.g. lingo and key concepts) to \\"get a taste\\" for navigating the multi-lingual Internet?<br />* What are some of the most common mistakes which organizations make when taking their Web sites global? How and why? Which lessons can be learned from these mistakes? How can other organizations avoid those mistakes?<br />* What does the Web workflow consist of? What are the key participants? What about costs, especially hidden costs? Why are \\"internationalization\\" and \\"localization\\" the two foundations of globalization?<br />* How to select and then manage translators or a translation services provider? How to maintain quality throughout the process? What will be required of copy writers to  credit and edit text(s) for a global audience?<br />* Why is designing for one country much easier than designing for many countries? What is involved when creating and then managing multilingual content? How can cultural and technical obstacles affect Web design?<br />* Why is it prudent to promote a Web site one country at a time? What is necessary to understand about multilingual search engines, portals, and domain names?<br />There are six \\"hands-on\\" chapters which explain, step-by-step (hand-by-hand?) how to translate a Web site into eight different languages. \\"Files are also available to download so that you can follow along on your own. By the end of the book, you will have created a web page with a potential reach of more than two billion people.\\" Yunker also includes what he calls seven \\"Spotlights\\": a probing analysis of each of several real-world case studies based on Monster.com, L.L. Bean, the Social Security Administration, FedEx, Burton Snowboards, Befrienders International, and FIFA World Cup, respectively. These case studies alone are well worth much more than the cost of the book.<br />By including in this review the brief excerpt from the Introduction, I hope I have suggested for which decision-makers in which organizations this book will be most valuable, indeed invaluable. Perhaps without intending to do so, Yunker has written a book which will also be of substantial value to those who provide various services to those organizations, services such as consulting, legal, accounting, insurance, logistics, transportation, and fulfillment. These service providers will also need to formulate appropriate web globalization strategies of their own to accommodate the strategies oftheir client organizations.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read Jakob Nielsen's Designing Web Usability (1999) and Homepage Usability: 50 Websites Deconstructed (2001) which Nielsen co-authored with Marie Tahir; Steve Krug's Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability (2000); Patrick J. Lynch and Sarah Horton's Web Style Guide: Basic Design Principles for Creating Web Sites (Second Edition, 2002);  Carla O'Dell's If Only We Knew What We Know: The Transfer of Internal Knowledge and Best Practice (1998); and Thomas H. Davenport and Laurence Prusak's Working Knowledge: How Organizations Manage What They Know (1997).<br />I also highly recommend this book to those who are associated with an organization now involved in or considering global e-learning initiatives. They are strongly encouraged to read, also, Allan J. Henderson's The E-Learning Question and Answer Book: A Survival Guide to Trainers and Business Managers (2002).f their client organizations.  <br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read Jakob Nielsen's Designing Web Usability (1999) and Homepage Usability: 50 Websites Deconstructed (2001) which Nielsen co-authored with Marie Tahir; Steve Krug's Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability (2000); Patrick J.

True, Henderson asks and then answers hundreds of important questions but he offers more, much more, in one of the most thoughtful and carefully organized business books I have ever read. The Q&amp;As are correlated within a narrative which explains eight major components of e-learning: What it is all about, its variable costs, strategies and tactics by which to implement it within a business, different e-learning styles, its building blocks, major factors which can affect a business' e-learning system, development and delivery of programs, and the system's \\"residence.\\" Henderson devotes a separate chapter to each of these components. There are three other chapters: \\"Let's Be Specific -- Some E-Learning Case Studies\\" (Chapter 2), \\"What Do Today's E-Learning Thought Leaders Say?\\" (Chapter 5), and \\"Where Is E-Learning Headed in the Future?\\" (Chapter 11).<br />Although Henderson focuses primarily on e-learning's options and opportunities for businesses, I think his book will also be invaluable to decision-makers in schools, colleges (especially junior and community colleges), and universities as well as to decision-makers in major health care organizations, especially those which have international commitments.<br />Henderson's writing style is \\"reader friendly.\\" For example, within each of the eleven chapters, he inserts \\"Tell Me More\\" several times to ease the transition from one key passage to another. He also makes brilliant use of various checklists and summaries. (Now you understand why I suggested earlier that this book offers more, much more, than questions and answers. The lively narrative gives both questions and answers a context.) Henderson is obviously an e-learning enthusiast but suggests \\"You should get excited about e-learning only to the extent that you can clearly see how it can improve your business\\"; specifically, in terms of cost saving, learning quality, rapid training rollout, and coping with shortened knowledge lifecycles. According to Henderson, e-learning can help to achieve objectives such as these:<br />\\"1. You can replace learning events that are already taking place in the classroom setting or at least as a face-to-face presentation. You can replace a costly series of classroom courses with a sequence of e-learning courses or events.<br />\\"2. You can create new learning opportunities; you can do training that is almost impossible to do when everyone has to gather face to face. You can, for example, train a group of new managers in bite-size chunks over a year's time if the managers are widely distributed in locations around the world.\\"<br />For many organizations, these are indeed highly desirable objectives. Those about to become involved with e-learning have three basic choices when determining where an e-learning system will reside: They can build it themselves and run it on a private intranet; they can use a public e-learning system at a Web site to which everyone else also has access; or get private access in a shared system.<br />In a single volume, Henderson asks most (if not all) of the questions which must be asked and then answers each with precision and concision. He does so, as indicated, within a prose narrative which (in effect) \\"walks\\" non-technologists such as I through a multi-dimensional process by which to understand what e-learning is (and isn't); how and why it can be beneficial; and finally, what is involved when designing, implementing, and developing an e-learning system.<br />If you share my high regard for this book, I urge you to check out Peter M. Senge's The Fifth Discipline (1990) and The Dance of Change: The Challenges of Sustaining Momentum in Learning Organizations (1999), William Isaacs' Dialogue and the Art of Thinking Together: A Pioneering Approach to Communicating in Business and in Life (1999), Carla O'Dell's If Only We Knew What We Know: The Transfer of Internal Knowledge and Best Practice (1998), and Thomas H.

This is one of several volumes in the Penguin Lives Series, each of which written by a distinguished author in her or his own right. Each provides a concise but remarkably comprehensive biography of its subject in combination with a penetrating analysis of the significance of that subject's life and career. I think this is a brilliant concept. My only complaint (albeit a quibble) is that even an abbreviated index is not provided. Those who wish to learn more about the given subject are directed to other sources.<br />When preparing to review various volumes in this series, I have struggled with determining what would be of greatest interest and assistance to those who read my reviews. Finally I decided that a few brief excerpts and then some concluding comments of my own would be appropriate.<br />On Churchill's values: \\"His beliefs had very simple origins, in the piety and goodness of his beloved nanny, Mrs. Everest; in the code of schoolboy fair play; in the ethic of manliness learned at the Royal Military College (RMC) at Sandhurst and in his regiment; in the strictures of the Commandments, preached in the Old Testament language that was to be one of the strongest of influences on his own, in Harrow School chapel. From all of those sources Churchill derived an undoubted sense of sin; his horror of wrongdoing was to inform his political life, particularly as it brought him eventually to confront the crimes of the dictators.\\" (page 11)<br />On Sir John (\\"Jackie\\") Fisher, as First Sea Lord, an early supporter of Churchill's career: \\"Fisher was that rare but valuable bird, a creative eccentric. Brave beyond question, a seadog to his fingertips, he had no truck with the settled order of things and was forever in search for a better way, a faster ship, a deadlier weapon....His nature was as passionate as Churchill's, his mind as quick; it was inevitable that the two should quarrel, but their differences were soon made up.\\" (page 79)<br />On Churchill and England during their \\"darkest hours\\": \\"Churchill privately confessed to depression. The sinkings of British merchant shipping...particularly lowered his optimism....[and yet according to Edward R. Murrow] one of Churchill's greatest achievements as wartime prime minister was to have 'mobilized the English language and sent it into battle'...[as when addressing the House of Commons he insisted] 'We shall not fail or falter; we shall not weaken or tire. Neither the sudden shock of battle, nor the long-drawn trials of vigilance and exertion will wear us down. Give us the tools and we will [in italics] finish the job!'\\" (Pages 142-143)<br />On what inspired Churchill to become a great war leader: \\"...he listened to himself....he listened to the version of British history he had constructed in his head as a subaltern in his hot, dreamy Indian afternoons; he listened to his own apotheosis in the biography of his ancestor [the first duke of Malborough]; he listened to his retelling of the First World War as an epic of of world crisis and eventual triumph; he listened to his recollections of his own youth and acquaintances then retold in his lives of Great Contemporaries (1937); his listened to his own version of American history as an equal epic to Britain's in the championship of liberty.\\" (pages 190-191)<br />Of special interest to me was Keegan's brilliant analysis of the many paradoxes which define Churchill the man. For example: \\"Companionable, he had few friends. Quick to display emotion, he evoked little personal affection outside his immediate family. A devoted husband and father, he was, by the account of his favorite and deeply loving daughter, Mary...difficult at home, often impossible.\\" Whether despite or because of his paradoxical nature, however, Churchill led his nation to eventual victory at a time when probably no one else could. Following his death in 1965 at the age of 90, his coffin was buried in a churchyard of the little Oxfordshire village of Bladon, near his birthplace at Blenheim Palace. However, Keegan suggests, \\"Churchill's real burial place is in the hearts of human beings.\\"<br />As is also true of the other volumes in the \\"Penguin Lives\\" series, this one provides all of the essential historical and biographical information but its greatest strength lies in the extended commentary, in this instance by John Keegan, arguably the greatest of 20th century military historians.

Finally I decided that a few brief excerpts and then some concluding comments of my own would be appropriate.<br />On Austen's focus: \\"Jane Austen chose to focus on daughters rather than mothers in her writing (with the exception of her short and curious novel Lady Susan), but nevertheless mothers are essential in her fiction. They are the engines that push the action forward, even when they fail to establish much in the way of maternal warmth. Daughters achieve their independence by working against the family constraints, their young spirits struck from the passive, lumpish postures of their ineffectual or distanced mothers.\\" (page 15)<br />On one of her dominant themes: \\"Because of her bright splintery dialogue is so often interrupted by a sad, unanswerable tone of estranged sympathy, stirred by complacent acts of hypocrisy or injustice, the reader of Austen's novels comes again and again to the reality of a persistent moral anger. It is a manageable anger, and artfully concealed by the mechanism of an arch, incontrovertible amiability.\\" (page 57)<br />Nephew James Edward Austen-Leigh on her \\"isolation\\": \\"Jane Austen lived in entire seclusion from the literary world; neither by correspondence, nor by personal intercourse was she known to any contemporary authors. It is probable that she never was in company with any contemporary authors. It is probable that she never was in company with persons whose talents or whose celebrity equaled her own; so that her powers never could have been sharpened by collision with superior intellects, nor her imagination aided by their casual suggestions.

A while ago, a friend strongly recommended this book, then purchased a copy and gave it to me as a gift. I placed it on a shelf in my study where it remained for almost a year. Frankly, the title (Super Brain Power) and subtitle (6 Keys to Unlocking Your Hidden Genius) seemed hyperbolic, as those of many other books are when devised to hype sales. For whatever reasons, I finally read it and then (with more curiosity than enthusiasm) began to complete the series of exercises during the prescribed 21-day period. Here are three conclusions of possible interest to those who read this review:<br />1. I have not as yet developed \\"super brain power.\\"<br />2. Nor have I as yet unlocked my \\"hidden genius,\\"<br />3. But I have strengthened significantly my verbal, visual, logical, creative, physical, and emotional skills.<br />As is my custom while reading, I highlight key passages for future reference and reacquaintance. I plan to do so with this book while trying to apply more effectively the various strategies and tactics which Sine recommends. I share her high regard for Howard Gardner and Daniel Goleman and her appreciation of their breakthrough research on multiple intelligences and emotional intelligence, respectively. They and several of their publications are identified in the \\"Recommended Resources\\" section.<br />Given the increasingly greater importance of innovation, many readers will be especially interested in what Stine has to say about \\"The Fourth Key\\" (Days 12-14) which may not unlock \\"creative genius\\" but can at least increase significantly  one's \\"Creative IQ.\\" I now presume to supplement her \\"Recommended Resources\\" list with Michael Michalko's Cracking Creativity: The Secrets of Creative Genius as well as Roger von Oech's A Whack on the Side of the Head, A Kick in the Seat of the Pants, and the most recently published Expect the Unexpected.<br />As with so many other books of this nature, the benefits derived from this book will depend almost entirely on three factors: How important it is to you to strengthen all or at least some of your verbal, visual, logical, creative, physical, and emotional skills; next, how conscientiously you complete the 21-day program; finally, how diligently you continue to strengthen various skills.

In it, he identifies and then discusses \\"strategies for achieving profits today and growth tomorrow through Web services.\\" First, I want to express my admiration of the Foreword which John Seely Brown provides. Unlike most other such introductions, it offers substantial benefits of its own to the careful reader in addition to \\"setting the table\\" for the \\"banquet\\" which Hagel serves. I agree with Brown that decision-makers in all organizations (regardless of size or nature) must break out of the mental models and other barriers which hold them back. As he correctly observes, \\"The challenge for all of us over time will be to develop a deeper understanding of the practices required to create and capture even more economic value.\\" It is indeed a formidable challenge to overcome what Jim O'Toole once characterized as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" I also agree with Brown that Hagel provides in this book both the counsel and inspiration to do so effectively.<br />It is important to keep in mind that Hagel views technology as a means by which to increase the effectiveness of a given strategy. That is to say, a commitment to providing Web services should be driven by an appropriate strategy. At a time when change is the only constant, when those involved in a competitive marketplace must (in effect) thrive to survive, the importance of having an effective strategy is incalculable. I agree with Hagel that one of the most important lessons learned since the 1980s is that \\"information technology is at best a catalyst and an enabler. It is never an answer in itself.\\" Nor could it be.<br /><br />For non-technologists such as I, Hagel carefully explains \\"how a new generation of IT and related architectures -- known generally as Web services technology and distributed service architectures -- will provide a significant catalyst in helping management break out of the [four] boxes that confine it\\": (1) financial performance pressures, (2) enterprise infrastructures, (3) enterprise boundaries, and (4) mental models. \\"The real value [of avoiding or breaking out of these boxes] is the increased capability of business managers for flexibility and collaboration -- capabilities that can in turn produce significant operating savings and growth options across the entire business.\\"<br />The material is organized as follows:<br />Part I: Finding Flexibility (i.e. how to identify and then respond to unmet needs, how and why Web services create new options, how and why Application Service Providers made a \\"false start\\")<br />Part II: Finding Near-Term Profitability (i.e. what a \\"pragmatic adoption\\" of Web services and \\"moving from the edge to the core\\" involves)<br />Part III: Creating Focus (i.e. how process networks create value through specialization, and, why it is necessary to \\"unbundle\\" inorder to \\"rebundle\\" core business processes)<br />Part IV: Accelerating Growth (i.e. how to create value through leveraged growth, and, what \\"reconfiguring\\" any organization involves)<br />Throughout this book, he includes several multi-purpose Tables which illustrate as well as clarify core topics such as \\"Four Management Boxes\\" (page 5), \\"Moving from the Edge to the Core with Web Services\\" (page 87), \\"Alternative Platforms for Leveraged Growth\\" (page 161), and \\"Migration Path of Layered Organizational Change\\" (page 187). It has always been my custom to highlight key passages in a business book for future reference and reacquaintance; I also plan to do so with all of Hagel's Tables.<br />What makes this book even more valuable is that it succeeds so well in discussing a subject which has not as yet received the attention it both needs and deserves. With meticulous care, Hagel explains how Web services can help any organization to realize bottom-line savings quickly and with a (relatively) modest investment, leverage other investments in existing applications while creating more flexibility, target specific areas for near-term cost reductions, establish or eliminate business relationships and do so with both expedition and grace, and finally, how to create leveraged growth platforms for long-term competitiveness and sustainable profitability. Out of the Box is a brilliant achievement.<br />Whenever it seems appropriate, I include in a review suggestions for \\"further study.\\" It is highly desirable but not imperative to read Hagel's previous books (Net Gain and Net Worth) before reading this one. I do recommend Adrian J. Slywotsky's Value Migration: How to Think Several Moves Ahead of the Competition and his more recently published The Art of Profitability as well as Robert S.

Mencken	Books	5	36	39	N	N	Beneath the &quot;Comic Mask&quot;	The title does not begin to suggest (nor could any title) the nature and extent of Mencken's intellectual and emotional complexity. Regrettably, for whatever reasons, he has received very little attention in recent years. My hope is that Teachout's biography will attract the attention it richly deserves and thereby direct attention to someone who was at one time a major figure in America's intellectual community. In Teachout's opinion, perhaps a \\"sage....not calm and reflective but as noisy as a tornado: witty and abrasive, self-confident and self-contradictory, sometimes maddening, often engaging, always inimitable.\\" Of special interest to me is Teachout's analysis of Mencken's association with the city of Baltimore in which he lived and worked throughout most of his life (1880-1956).<br />He left school after his father's death (1899) to become a reporter for the Baltimore Morning Herald, later serving as drama critic, city editor, and then managing editor of the Baltimore Evening Herald. Soon after the Herald folded in 1906, he joined the Baltimore Sun and continued with the Sun as editor, columnist, or contributor for most of his career. He published studies of George Bernard Shaw (1905) and Friedrich Nietzsche (1908), both of whom he admired. From 1914 to 1923, with George Jean Nathan he co-edited a satirical magazine, The Smart Set; in 1924 he and Nathan co-founded the American Mercury, a cultural magazine for &quot;a civilized minority,&quot; which he co-edited for nine years. Mencken has been generally viewed (if viewed at all) as a crusty curmudgeon, never fully appreciated for the quality of his contributions to academic scholarship as well as to journalism during the first third of the 20th century.<br />To Teachout's great credit, he resurrects rather than revises an abundance of relevant biographical, social, and cultural material which he examines with both precision and circumspection. My guess (only a guess) is that those who read this biography will view Mencken through the filters of their own values. Some will find him \\"delightful\\" and \\"colorful\\"; others will be offended by his (to put it mildly) political incorrectness; still others will conclude (as Teachout seems to) that Mencken was the archetypical skeptic of almost everyone and everything...except his own opinions. For better or worse, \\"he was to the first part of the twentieth century what Mark Twain was to the last part of the nineteenth.\\" Until reading this biography, I tended to view Mencken as a reasonably well-educated variation of Archie Bunker. Edmund Wilson once suggested that Mencken's public persona was a \\"comic mask\\" which concealed an \\"all-too-human face.\\" In this context, Teachout has succeeded brilliantly in revealing that face.view Mencken through the filters of their own values.

I seriously doubt if that incident \\"changed basketball forever\\" but it certainly had a great impact (no pun intended) on Washington and Tomjanovich. In my opinion, Feinstein's greatest challenge was to provide an analysis of that incident within the historical context of the almost 25 years since \\"the punch\\" was thrown. He had several options. Here are three: Focus primarily on the two principals; or focus primarily on what he views as the larger significance of violence in competitive sports; or focus on the society within which such violence is tolerated, if not admired. For whatever reasons, he seems to have elected all three and the results are disappointing.<br />The narrative is excessively redundant, the coverage is generally superficial, and worst of all, Feinstein (if only by implication) suggests to this reader a number of questions which are worthy of thoughtful responses. Why, for example, are the NFL and NHL now imposing more serious penalties (fines and/or suspensions without pay) on athletes for what are viewed as acts of violence? How does the behavior of certain athletes reflect their socio-economic background? And what about the violent behavior of fans (even those attending their children's games) who attack officials as well as each other? During a recent college football game, an assistant coach was arrested on the field after allegedly injuring a fan. What's going on? What does it all mean?<br />Given the opinions I have just shared, my rating is explained by the fact that I think Feinstein has at least refocused attention on a distant event which invites thoughtful analysis in books yet to be written. That alone is worth an additional Star. My hope is that someone else (John Updike? George Will?) will come forth with a book which Feinstein could have and should have written.ar.

Finally I decided that a few brief excerpts and then some concluding comments of my own would be appropriate.<br />On Leonardo's &quot;place&quot;: &quot;Leonardo was not to be found in that place [Casa di Leonardo]. In fact, he is not to be found in [italics] any place. He is not a creature of places or monuments or even of permanence. He flashed across his time and was gone, leaving a vast body of work almost none of which except the paintings could be fully appreciated until centuries after his death, and far away from the house in which he was almost certainly not born. Quoting the famous statement of Freud, 'He was like a man who awoke too early in the darkness, while others were all still asleep.'&quot; (pages 3-4)<br />On Leonardo's \\"humanism\\": \\"Though he has often been called the ultimate Renaissance man, there is much to be said for the argument that Leonardo was only in part a man of the Renaissance. While he epitomized the zest for life and nature that was the guiding theme of humanism, he did at the same time eschew the dependence on ancient sources and the worshipful repetition of its principles that equally characterized its scholarship.\\" (page 7)<br />On Leonardo's cosmology: \\"Leonardo was intrigued by motion, and the forces involved. The continuous flowings of energy in nature and in the life of man are a constant and even a central theme running through his manuscripts like the streamings of waters to which he often alluded. Moving water, in fact, is his symbol of these flowing energies; it is vital to his conception of the universe.\\" (page 47)<br />On Leonardo's research: \\"...there is no evidence at any time during his seven decades of life that he ever stopped long enough in his constant pursuit of knowledge to allow himself the leisure to organize what he had discovered....putting it into neat little piles of knowledge must have seemed a waste of time and talent. What is more, his studies were really undertaken for Leonardo alone, and not for any wider purpose of educating his contemporaries; it was with himself that his studies conversed.\\" (page 89)<br />As is also true of the other volumes in the \\"Penguin Lives\\" series, this one provides all of the essential historical and biographical information but its greatest strength lies in the extended commentary, in this instance by Sherwin B. Nuland. He also includes a highly informative \\"Bibliographical Note\\" for those who wish to learn more about Leonardo.

Finally I decided that a few brief excerpts and then some concluding comments of my own would be appropriate.<br />On Joyce and Ireland: \\"Of all the great Irish writers, Joyce's relationship with his country remains the most incensed and yet the most meditative. Beckett, a much more cloistered man, was unequivocal; he made France his home and eventually wrote in French and though his elegiac works carry the breath of his native land, he did not expect Foxrock, his birthplace, to be etched in the consciousness of the world. Joyce did. He determined to reinvent the city where he had been marginalized, laughed at and barred from literary circles. he would be the poet of his race.\\" (page 15)<br />On criticisms of his portrayal of Dublin: Joyce \\"said he was not to be blamed for the odor of ash pits and rotted cabbage and offal in these stories [i.e. in Dubliners] because that was how he saw his city. 'We are foolish, comic, motionless, corrupted, yet we are worthy of sympathy too,' he laughed haughtily and added that if Ireland were to deny that sympathy to its characters, the rest of the world would not. In this he was mistaken.\\" (page 78)<br />On his deteriorating health: \\"The strains were beginning to show. he had endocrine treatment for his arthritis, had to have all his teeth removed and was fitted with permanent plates. His eyesight so worsened that he had only one-seventh normal vision. He was given iodine leeches for his bad eye but soon it was clear that they would have to operate.\\" (page 130)<br />On his enigmatic nature: \\"The truth is that the Joyce [others] saw was a fraction of the inner man. No one knew Joyce, only himself, no one could. His imagination was meteoric, his mind ceaseless in the accruing of knowledge, words crackling in his head, images crowding in on him 'like the shades at the entrance to the underworld.' What he wanted to do was to wrest the secret from life and that could only be done through language because, as he said, the history of people is the history of language.\\" (pages 165-166)<br />As is also true of the other volumes in the \\"Penguin Lives\\" series, this one provides all of the essential historical and biographical information but its greatest strength lies in the extended commentary, in this instance by Edna O'Brien.

This the first of two books about Cook which I recently read and thoroughly enjoyed. (The other is Vanessa Collingridge's Captain Cook: A Legacy Under Fire.) They discuss a common subject but from different perspectives. I highly recommend both. According to Horwitz, Cook set out on various voyages (1768-1779) uncertain of eventual destinations and traveled more than 200,000 miles while dependent (by today's standards) on crude, indeed primitive navigation instruments but sustained by his superior seamanship skills. Of special interest to me is the fact that Horwitz traced many of the same voyages to Bora Bora, Australia, Savage Island, Tonga, Alaska, and Hawaii. He shares his own reactions to what these areas have become, most in sharp contrast to the &#34;pure state of Nature&#34; as Cook once described it. Horwitz's extensive research suggests that many of those whom Cook encountered correctly suspected (and feared) that their lives and communities would never be the same after Cook's &#34;discovery&#34; of them. Beyond the wealth of information this book provides, it is that rare achievement among works of nonfiction: a page-turner.	2002-10-25

Finally I decided that a few brief excerpts and then some concluding remarks would be appropriate.<br />On misconceptions of Mozart (e.g. the &quot;willful child&quot; unable to grow up, the \\"miracle worker\\" who never needed to revise a single note): \\"These tenacious caricatures are distortions rather than fabrications; most of them, as we shall discover, contain a kernel of truth....But Mozart's life in music is fascinating enough without embroidery; his reputation as a genius is not threatened by mundane truths.\\" (Page 2)<br />In a letter to his father (1781): \\"Nature speaks as loudly in me as in anyone, and perhaps louder than in many big, strong lugs. I cannot possibly live like most of the young men today. -- First, I have too much religion; secondly, too much love for my fellow beings and too honorable a disposition to seduce an innocent girl; and thirdly, too much horror and repugnance, dread and fear of diseases, and too much care for my health to scuffle with whores.\\" (Page 70)<br />Peter Gay on Salieri: \\"There is an all-too-well-known melodramatic tale about Antonio Salieri poisoning Mozart. It began as a rumor and was first given literary form in the 1820s in a verse playlet by Pushkin. It is a malicious, preposterous fabrication, but hints at the envy Mozart's rivals had every right to feel. Yet Mozart, too, had grounds for envy: Salieri, born in Italy but long settled in Vienna, occupied privileged posts that Mozart would have deserved but, given Emperor Joseph's predilection for Salieri, could never hope to obtain.\\" (Page 100)<br />Mozart's last year: \\"[It] has often been described as one long preparation for death. But in that time, Mozart wrote two operas, a piano concerto, a large number of minuets and counterdances, a clarinet concerto, a Masonic cantata, two quintets, and most of the Requiem. His creativity was still working at full speed.\\" (Page 156)<br />I am among those who have seen the film Amadeus many times, admiring it more each time. For dramatic purposes, those who produced Amadeus focus on several of the \\"tenacious caricatures\\" to which Gay refers. What I especially appreciate about this biography is that Gay duly acknowledges all of Mozart's human limitations and inadequacies while examining Mozart's creative discipline in ways and to an extent which the film does not. With regard to this biography's context, Gay tells his reader only what is essential to know about the various cities in which Mozart lived and worked during various periods in his all-too-brief life (January 27,1756-December 5, 1791). Rather than create an historical or cultural context, Gay prefers to focus primarily on Mozart's art.

Finally I decided that a few brief excerpts and then some concluding remarks would be appropriate.<br />On Johnson's approach to his subject: \\"It is one of the contentions of this book that Bonaparte was not an ideologue but an opportunist who seized on the accident of the French Revolution to propel himself into supreme power....He believed in his stars, like the ancient Romans he admired (insofar as he admired anyone). He felt he had a destiny, and most of his life he was confident in it. But, sure as he was of what destiny intended for him, he nonetheless was determined to wrest it from events with his own brain,arms, and will.\\" (Page 7)<br />Bonaparte and the French Revolution: \\"Bonaparte would not have possessed the ruthless disregard of human life, of natural and man-made law, of custom and good faith needed to carry it through without the positive example and teaching of the Revolution. The Revolution was a lesson in the power of evil to replace idealism, and Bonaparte was its ideal pupil.\\" (Page 29)<br />On Bonaparte \\"declension\\": \\"There are material reasons for [it]. But there was a metaphysical reason, too, embracing the intellectual, cultural, and spiritual dimensions. He had once been `a man whose time had come.' In the second half of the 1790's, Bonaparte was an embodiment, all over Europe, of the protest against the old legitimists, their inefficiency, privileges, obscurantism, and misuse of resources, above all the talents and genius of youth. Thus he prospered and conquered. By 1813, however, he was out of date. His time had gone.\\" (Page 140)<br />These brief excerpts correctly indicate how Johnson correlates information about an especially turbulent period in late-18th and early-19th century European history with his own analysis of arguably the most influential, indeed most disruptive (if not most destructive) figure at that time. It is Johnson's conclusion that \\"bonapartism\\" -- with its deification of force and war, the all-powerful centralized state, the use of cultural propaganda to apotheosize the autocrat, the marshaling of entire peoples in the pursuit of personal and ideological power -- \\"came to hateful maturity only in the twentieth century, which will go down in history as the Age of Infamy.\\" From Johnson's perspective, mankind failed to learn from the example of Bonaparte \\"the central lesson of history: that all forms of greatness, military and administrative, nation and empire building, are as nothing -- indeed are perilous in the extreme -- without a humble and contrite heart.\\"<br />Hopefully these brief excerpts and comments will encourage those who read this review to read Johnson's biography.

Mine are George Orwell, E.B. White, and Elizabeth Hardwick. You can thus understand my eagerness to read her biography of Melville. Early on, she observes that \\"....the sea was to give him his art, his occupation, but the actual romance of landscape, the sun on the waves, the stars at night, are nearly always mixed with with the brutality of life on board. And the art that saved him, the discovery of his genius, was a sort of Grub Street, a book a year, sometimes two.\\" As Hardwick carefully explains, there was throughout Melville's life \\"a forlorn accent shadowing the great energy of his thought and imagination. There is a rueful dignity in his life and personal manner, and sometimes a startling abandonment of propriety on the pages.\\"<br />On Elizabeth Shaw: \\"The marriage was more prudent for Melville than for his wife. He might long form male companionship, even for love, but marriage changed him from an unanchored wanderer into an obsessive writer, almost if there, in a house, in a neighborhood, there was nothing else for this man to do except to use the capital he had found in himself with the writing of Typee and Omoo [two of his earliest works].\\" (page 51)<br />On friendship with Hawthorne, to whom Moby Dick was dedicated: \\"Hawthorne and Melville met in the Berkshires, and a friendship developed unique in Melville's life, unique in inspiration and disappointment....Melville had found in Hawthorne the lone intellectual and creative friendship of his life, had found another struck by the terror and dark indifference of the universe...He would share the fate of being a writer in America, share his ragged banner: Failure is the test of greatness. But there was a disjunction of temperament, an inequality of fervor.\\" (Page 66)<br />On Ishmael: \\"[He], the young man from Manhattan, is the moral center of [Moby Dick], a work tantalizingly subversive and yet somehow if not affirming at least forgiving of the blind destructiveness of human nature and of nature itself.\\" (Page 84)<br />On Melville's death: \\"He died at home in his own house with a wife to care for him in his great distress and need.

Deviance equals innovation and innovation equals opportunity. Opportunity creates markets that in turn are destroyed by deviance.\\" Mathews and Wacker assert that deviance follows a linear pattern: Fringe > Edge > Realm of the Cool > Next Big Thing > Social Convention > Clich&eacute; > Icon or Archetype or Oblivion.<br />In other words, what began \\"operating in a defined measure away from the norm\\" eventually becomes the norm and thus vulnerable to something else \\"operating in a defined measure away from the norm\\" which eventually....You get the idea. Mathews and Wacker describe the voice, spirit, or incarnation of deviance with a neologism, the devox. Used as a metaphor, the devox illustrates that \\"things have changed -- and continue to change -- at such a rate that conventional language is no longer an effective tool for describing what's going on around around us.\\" Nor can then conventional language describe what has yet to occur. \\"Remember the first rule of the devox: Nothing's more foolish than conventional wisdom.\\"<br />Of the ten themes which Mathews and Wacker examine (see pages 10-12), for me the most powerful is what they characterize as \\"the Abolition of Context\\" which occurs when Social Convention has eroded to the point at which it loses its authority to define reality for the society it theoretically describes. As context is abolished, the challenge is to build a new culture \\"and this demands a whole new set of plans and equipment. We need new language to communicate what we're about. We need to get beyond the wisdom of the ages and learn how to embrace the wisdom of the moment.

A Lot. More than any of us admit, and certainly more than any of us act on....Reflecting on the research presented [in this volume], we believe that a company that understands the power of human passions, and manages those passions in its customers, its employees, and its leaders, will create value faster than its competitors.\\" So, this volume combines a highly informative, at times compelling case study with a thoughtful and eloquent explanation of how the core lessons of Do-Co-Mo's success can help literally any organization (regardless of size or nature) to achieve its own success by creating, nourishing, and sustaining the passion of everyone involved.<br />Please allow me a brief digression. By now I have become convinced that it is impossible to motivate others but that it is possible to inspire others to motivate themselves. I am also convinced that what people believe determines their values and those values determine their behavior. Throughout human history, the most effective religious, military, and social leaders have been passionate about the given enterprise and their passion was contagious. Because others shared their faith, exceptional success was achieved...often against what any sane person would agree are prohibitive odds. How else to explain the survival of the Christian church, for example, during decades of vicious and relentless persecution following the crucifixion? Draw up a list of those whom you consider to be the greatest leaders since then. How many were passionate in their beliefs? How many inspired others? Probably all of them, no matter which ones you named.<br />Obviously, this book will be of special interest to executives in companies now actively competing in one or more telecom marketplaces. There is much to be learned from the the case study based on DoCoMo, \\"Japan's wireless tsunami.\\" Whether or not Beck and Wade intended it, I think this book will also be of substantial value to executives in all other organizations regardless of size or nature (including non-profits) which have failed to create, nourish, and then sustain passionate loyalty among their respective constituencies. It is no coincidence that the most highly admired companies, year after year, are also the most profitable. Extensive research among those employed by them or who do business with them reveals these common characteristics: identification with the organization's values, trust in its senior management, pride in its products and/or services, respect for associates, feeling appreciated, and passion to help the organization to achieve its objectives.<br />Speak with anyone employed by Southwest Airlines, for example, and ask her or him to share thoughts and feelings about this airline. Invariably the responses will be (in effect) \\"It's great fun to work here,\\" \\"I really feel like I am making an important contribution,\\" \\"Everyone I work with respects me and I respect them,\\" \\"We're the best but we can be even better!\\" and \\"It's not just a job. It's a way of life...and I love it!\\" These are essentially the responses I have received whenever I have made such an inquiry of Southwest's pilots, flight attendants, baggage handlers, and reservation agents.<br />Recall Beck and Wade's affirmation: \\"We believe that a company that understands the power of human passions, and manages those passions in its customers, its employees, and its leaders, will create value faster than its competitors.\\" As of when this review is written, Southwest Airlines' cap value is greater than its six major competitors...combined. Driven by passion as well as by ability, energy, and technology, DoCoMo now has approximately the same number of Internet customers as does American Online...and accomplished that five times faster. Draw your own conclusions.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are strongly encouraged to check out Maister's Practice What You Preach, Hutcheson's Portraits of Success, Shuman and Twombly's Everyone Is a Customer, the fully revised and updated edition of Rosenbluth and Peters' The Customer Comes Second, Bossidy and Charan's Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done, and Collins' Good to Great.mers, its employees, and its leaders, will create value faster than its competitors.\\" As of when this review is written, Southwest Airlines' cap value is greater than its six major competitors...combined.

As I read this book, I was reminded of Socrates' observation that \\"the unexamined life is not worth living\\" and of Thoreau's assertion that many people \\"live lives of quiet desperation.\\" If either or both describes your current situation, Hendricks offers information and counsel which can be of incalculable value to you. The origin of the word \\"entrepreneur\\" is a late-19th century French word meaning \\"one who undertakes.\\" Today, we think of entrepreneurs as those who undertake risks. Obviously, a decision to leave a \\"job\\" to seek opportunities elsewhere can be perilous. It should also be noted that many of those who are self-employed are miserably unhappy, and, that many of those within an organization are enthusiastic, indeed passionate about their \\"job.\\" Henricks makes a critically important distinction between standard of living and quality of life. Moreover, the latter refers to both personal and career issues. He provides rock-solid advice, anchored in a wealth of his own real-world experiences. obviously, he is a thoughtful and caring person. His counsel is practical, expressed with no-nonsense eloquence.<br />The questions Henricks poses, in my opinion, are far more important than any of the answers he provides. Years ago, Rod Steiger was asked if young people sought out his advice. \\"Oh yeah, sure, all the time. And I always ask them the same question: 'Do you want to be an actor or do you [in italics] have to be an actor?' The longer it takes them to answer that question, the less likely they'll ever make it.\\" Not everyone feels compelled to create a business. Fair enough. But surely everyone can \\"undertake\\" to obtain more than a paycheck for their labors; to take prudent risks; in Tennyson's words, \\"to strive, to seek, to find\\" a higher, more fulfilling quality of life. How easy it is to become hostage to what Jim O'Toole characterizes as the \\"ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" Henricks urges his reader to free herself or himself from such confinement. It is no coincidence that, year after year, the most highly admired companies (e.g. Southwest Airlines) are also the most profitable. Each has a culture in which the \\"lifestyle entrepreneur\\" (Henricks' term) is strongly encouraged, not merely tolerated.<br />Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book? Those who now live unexamined lives of quiet desperation. Once having read this book, many of them may be unwilling and/or unable to free themselves from the \\"ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" But at least, thanks to Henricks, they will have completed a rigorous process of self-examination. Does he provide a map or a blueprint for personal fulfillment? No. Rather, he provides a mirror and a compass which, for many of his readers, will be of incalculable value.finement.

Books	5	9	12	N	Y	Passion, Eloquence, and Conviction	Clarke is CEO and Crossland is vice chair of tompeterscompany!. They have been friends as well as business associates for more than 20 years.  What we have here is their attempt to share what they have learned about what Tom Peters describes (in the Foreword) as \\"the emotion, the passion, the care, the connection between leaders and followers,\\" a subject Peters thinks other authors have short-changed in their discussions of leadership. I don't agree. Bennis, Kotler, O'Toole, and Maister (to name but four) have a great deal of value to say. (Has Peters read their works?) In fact, Clarke and Crossland have made a unique and substantial contribution to the study of a business subject which probably attracts more interest than does any other.<br /><br />They insist (and I agree) that the ability to communicate powerfully \\"is the leverage leaders need and most lack.\\" Quoting John Gardner, \\"Communication between leader and constituent is at the heart of of everything.\\" Clarke and Crossland assert (again I agree) that the biggest problem with leadership communication \\"is the illusion that it has occurred.\\" That is, the leader incorrectly assumes that others understand, agree with, and care about what has been communicated; worse yet, leaders then assume that others will take appropriate action. Most of the time, these are indeed false and dangerous, often destructive assumptions. To develop what the authors characterize as \\"the leader's voice,\\" it is necessary to gain clarity and depth in four areas: authenticity, foresight, connection, and context. They suggest HOW. They identify and discuss \\"three essential channels\\" by which to convey important leadership messages: factual (Chapter 4), emotional (Chapter 5), and symbolic (Chapter 6). Throughout human history, the greatest religious, political, business, and military leaders have used all three. The genius of their leadership has been their ability to \\"speak with a voice that pushes past cynicism, doubt, and uncertainty.\\"<br /><br />For me, one of the most valuable concepts in this book is that of what the authors call \\"One Voice\\" organizations. I am reminded of one of the final scenes in the film Spartacus when the victorious Roman general and his slave master walk among the captured gladiators, determined to locate Spartacus, dead or alive. Unless he is identified, the defeated gladiators are told, all of them will be crucified. Just as their leader is about to step forward to save them, they stand up one after another and announce \\"I am Spartacus!\\" I think this is precisely what Clarke and Crossland have in mind. Everyone involved in a \\"OneVoice\\" organization identifies with its mission and its values; does everything humanly possible to achieve the organization's objectives; and, most important of all, considers herself or himself to BE that organization. The significance of that concept is illustrated every day in every contact with a customer. People do business with other people. Whenever we seek assistance from a customer service department, the person with whom we speak IS that organization. How we are treated by just one person usually determines what we think of an entire organization.<br /><br />Obviously my rating of this book indicates my high regard for what Clarke and Crossland have accomplished in this book. Presumably they agree with me that \\"leadership\\" is synonymous with initiative and not limited only to those with title or status. Tichy correctly insists that the most effective organizations are those which have leadership at all levels. True, it is highly desirable for each member of an organization to have a \\"passionate voice\\" when communicating with others. It is even more important that the organization has \\"OneVoice.\\"  Otherwise, it has none.or me, one of the most valuable concepts in this book is that of what the authors call \\"One Voice\\" organizations.

My opinion is that this is the most thought-provoking as yet produced by the self-styled \\"geezer.\\" His co-author is Robert J. Thomas. They are now at work on another book, entitled Leadership Crucibles, which develops in much greater depth the material they introduce in Chapter Four of this book.<br />In From Good to Great, Jim Collins explains that he and his 21 research associates set out to answer these questions: Is it possible for a good, mediocre or even terrible organization to become great? If so, what are the underlying variables that enable it to do so? If not, why not?. \\"We came to think of our research effort as akin to looking inside a black box. Each step along the way was like installing another lightbulb to shed light on the inner workings of the good-to-great process.\\"<br />Similarly, what we have here is Bennis and Thomas' response to another question: \\"Why are some people able to extract wisdom from experience, however harsh, and others are not?\\" Bennis and Thomas asked successful geeks to share the secrets of their youthful triumphs and distinguished geezers to tell them how they continue to stay active and engaged despite the changes wrought by age. They selected and then interviewed a group of 43 effective leaders, ranging in age from 21 to 93. Their research also included others who were not interviewed. As many as possible of the interviews were videotaped because Bennis and Thomas knew that \\"taping would preserve a wealth of information that no transcript could capture.\\". The results of their study are presented and discussed in this book. It would be a disservice to them as well as to those who read this review to summarize all of the conclusions they reached.<br />Among the findings of their research, Bennis and Thomas learned that Geezers and Geeks had quite different concerns when in the age range of 25-30. The Geezers' concerns were making a living, earning a good salary, starting and supporting a family, stability and security, working hard and getting rewarded by the system, listening to their elders, paying \\"dues\\" to various organizations, and using retirement to enjoy life. In contrast, Geeks' concerns (during the same age range) were making history, achieving personal wealth, launching a career, change and impermamence, working hard so they can write their own rules, wondering if their elders \\"got it wrong,\\" deciding where loyalty should lie, and achieving a balance between work and life.<br />These are significant differences which Bennis and Thomas explain in terms of the different eras in which Geeks lived (at ages 25-30), the societal values of their respective generations, and various \\"defining moments\\" such as those associated with the Great Depression, World War Two as well as Viet Nam and the emergence of the Internet and World Wide Web.<br />Of special interest to me is Bennis and Thomas' discussion of \\"crucibles\\" from which some emerge as leaders but most others do not. As they explain, they developed a theory that describes, they believe for the first time, how leaders come to be. \\"We believe that we have identified the process that allows an individual to undergo testing and to emerge, not just stronger, but better equipped with the tools he or she needs both to lead and to learn. It is a model that explains how individuals make meaning out of difficult events -- we call them crucibles [in italics] -- and how that process of 'meaning making' both galvanizes individuals and gives them their distinctive voice.\\" They cite and then discuss a number of individuals who underwent that process and, as a result, became highly-effective leaders. Clarke and Crossland also have much of value to say about \\"the leader's voice\\" in their book so entitled.<br />Bennis and Thomas conclude their book with an especially apt quotation from Edith Wharton: \\"In spite of illness, in spite even of the arch enemy, sorrow, one can remain alive long past the the usual state of integration if one is unafraid of change, insatiable in intellectual curiosity, interested in big things, and happy in small ways.\\" These are indeed words to live and grow by for both Geeks and Geezers.sorrow, one can remain alive long past the the usual state of integration if one is unafraid of change, insatiable in intellectual curiosity, interested in big things, and happy in small ways.\\" These are indeed words to live and grow by for both Geeks and Geezers.	2002-09-20

Most other teams  receive no publicity although what they contribute is of great importance to their respective organizations.  With the assistance of David Rottenberg,  Jeffrey Shuman wrote The Rhythm of Business in which he asserts that each organization  evolves in often unpredictable ways and to an extent takes on a life of its own. The challenge for decision-makers is to recognize that \\"rhythm\\" and then ensure that everyone involved is in \\"harmony\\" with it. Later, again assisted by Rottenberg, Shuman co-authored Collaborative Communities with Janice Twombley. In it, they correctly explain why and how communication, cooperation, and collaboration are essential to the effectiveness of teamwork. No news there. What differentiates their book from so many others is that they define \\"community\\" so as to include literally anyone who is directly and even indirectly associated with a given organization.<br />In this volume, Shuman and Twombley develop in much greater depth several of the ideas which were introduced in the previous book. For example, they explain how and why an organization's effective communication, cooperation, and collaboration can nourish and indeed strengthen its relations with customers. In fact, according to them,  literally anyone associated directly or even indirectly with that organization must be viewed -- and treated -- as a customer. Moreover, they introduce and then explain a proven method for measuring the value of every relationship, both within and beyond the organization.<br />Shuman and Twombley carefully organize their material within three Parts: The Era of Collaborative Business, Purposeful Collaboration, and Choreographing Your Success. They agree with Drucker's admonition that \\"you increasingly have to think through what relationships make the most sense -- the customer is the most important relationship.\\" The challenge is to identify all customers, classify them according to the nature of their relationship with the given organization, and then determine with meticulous care their relative importance to the organization's own objectives. This is an on-going process, requiring both rigorous vigilance and absolute precision, because the relative value of customers can increase or diminish and do so suddenly and unexpectedly. Shuman and Twombley explain HOW to design, implement, and then monitor this process by guiding their reader through it (literally) step-by-step. Throughout the book, they also provide dozens of \\"Figures\\" which graphically support key points. For example, Figure 8.2 illustrates the \\"Relationship Scenario Matrix\\" whereas Figure 10.1 illustrates the \\"Purposeful Collaboration Process.\\" Shuman and Twombley are well aware of all the risks involved. They identify them and then suggest how to avoid them or at least minimize their impact on the value measurement process.<br />Obviously I think highly of this book. I also have a healthy respect for the difficulty of applying Shuman and Twombley's ideas. My own rather experience suggests that most people do not fear change; rather, they fear the unknown. Hence the importance of effective communications and the even greater importance of getting everyone actively involved in the process, but only after they fully understand what the objectives are as well as why those objectives are important, not only to the organization but also to every individual within that organization. I also agree with Drucker about customer relationships while presuming to suggest that the value of those relationships is almost entirely dependent on those employees (or if you prefer, associates) within the organization who interact with customers.<br />Near the end of the film Spartacus, the Roman general Marcus Licinius Crassus (played by Laurence Olivier) and his slave master Lentulus Batiatus (played by Peter Ustinov) walk among the survivors of the defeated gladiator army looking for Spartacus.  They are told that unless they identify him or his body, they will be crucified. One by one, they stand up proclaiming \\"I am Spartacus!\\" I recalled that scene as I finished reading this book. It is not enough merely to measure the value of customers. That value must also be sustained, preferably increased. When a corporation (let's call it OmniGlobal InternationaI) achieves both, every one of its people can proudly proclaim \\"I am OGI!\\"<br />In fact, from a customer's perspective, anyone with whom she or he interacts in an organization IS that organization, for better or worse.the film Spartacus, the Roman general Marcus Licinius Crassus (played by Laurence Olivier) and his slave master Lentulus Batiatus (played by Peter Ustinov) walk among the survivors of the defeated gladiator army looking for Spartacus.

As we all know, there are negative connotations of PR because it is not always truthful even if well-told. Marconi notes that \\"there has been a dramatic increase in the allocation of funds from marketing budgets that provide some benefit to nonprofit organizations. The expenditure of these funds to serve the interests of both the company and the community has come to be known as [in italics] cause marketing.\\" The one-year anniversary of 9/11 caused major corporations and their agencies to question whether or not to advertise on that tragic date. Their concern was that any advertising, however thoughtful and sensitive, could be perceived as self-serving. That is a legitimate concern. In Chapter 5, Marconi cites six examples of \\"self-serving and opportunistic\\" initiatives during a national period of sadness following 9/11. Here's one: \\"Morrell &amp; Company announced in a full-page ad that it would hold a `Grapes of Grief and Gratitude' benefit wine auction for families of the New York firefighters, police, and emergency response professionals.\\" This is cause marketing at its worst.<br />Marconi also includes many examples of cause marketing at its best. That is to say, marketing which establishes contact with those who buy and use their products and services or support their issues and will feel better for doing so. \\"Cause marketing seeks to take the process even further when the marketer for a company (1) identifies a cause that the company can embrace and believe in, and (2) makes a connection with the constituent group that shares the company's dedication to that cause.\\" What we have here, then, is a cohesive and comprehensive explanation of how to plan and then implement \\"cause marketing\\" at its best. Eminently worthwhile organizations receive at least some of the support they urgently need; those who provide that support, who demonstrate corporate social responsibility with active community involvement,  generally \\"do well by doing good.\\"<br />But here's a key point: Unless such support and involvement are -- and are perceived to be -- both appropriate and authentic (i.e. sincere), they invariably do irreparable damage to an organization's credibility. Marconi explains this point while examining a number of case studies of both effective and counter-productive cause marketing. All things considered, people generally prefer to do business with those with whom they share the same values and, better yet, with whom they share the same loyalties. It is obvious to his reader that Marconi cares deeply about corporate social responsibility and active community involvement. It would be a mistake, however, to assume that they should be primarily assumed by major corporations. Where I live, independent merchants generously support fundraising activities by local schools, athletic teams, and churches of all denominations. Their contributions are both monetary and non-monetary, donated because they want to be \\"good citizens,\\" joining with others in the support of worthwhile causes. Of course, some of this \\"good will\\" results in additional business but that is not the merchants' motive.<br />In the final chapter of this book, Marconi reviews the rules, reasons, and rewards of cause marketing. They provide wise and practical guidance to any organization or individual either involved in \\"cause marketing\\" now or considering it. Once having read the book, I again reflected on the groundswell of responses to the tragedies which occurred on 9/11/01. Marconi suggests (and I agree) that principled cause marketing doesn't wait for \\"the next dark day\\" to fulfill itself. Rather, it shouldbe an on-going process which responds to or creates opportunities to \\"make a difference,\\" indeed to make a significant difference and for the better. Its ROI cannot easily be measured in terms of sales and profits. Those involved in cause marketing worthy of the name appreciate how important it is and know that its value to society is incalculable.be an on-going process which responds to or creates opportunities to \\"make a difference,\\" indeed to make a significant difference and for the better.

Amram re-examines and re-evaluates several of the core concepts which she and co-author Nalin Kulatilaka discussed in a previous work, Real Options: Managing Strategic Investment in an Uncertain World. However, as she explains in her Preface, she has since drawn two strong conclusions. \\"First, in many [but not all] applications, real options is not the right tool. I'll raise this issue through this book [Value Sweep] and show how to combine real options with other strategic perspectives. Second, decision analysis (and decision analysis coupled with real options) is quite an expansive approach; it can handle a lot of detail. Often, however, the detail overwhelms the rationale.\\"<br />Here are several important questions which many organizations are now struggling to answer:<br />1. How can the value of growth from our new products and innovations be compared to the value of existing business?<br />2. Is there any rationale behind our valuations based on Internet growth expectations? Is there a way to identify and track the changing value of growth?<br />3. What's the value of our intellectual property? What is the value of our business models built around selling of ideas?<br />4. Are we prepared to tell a convincing, indeed compelling \\"story\\" about our growth opportunities that supports the value of our growth? Can we provide credible numbers with that \\"story\\"?<br />Amram addresses all of these and many others in 15 chapters which are organized as follows: \\"One Map of Value\\" (Chapter 1) and \\"The Look and Feel of Growth Opportunities\\" (Chapter 2), followed by three Parts and an Epilogue: Expanding the Toolkit (e.g. \\"Discounted Cash Flow,\\" Chapter 3), Valuing Growth (e.g. \\"Growth Value Benchmarks from Venture Capital,\\" Chapter 8), Across the Sweep of Value (e.g. \\"Creating the Credible Growth Engine,\\" Chapter 13), and then her Epilogue in which she focuses on \\"Leading Growth\\" in Chapter 14 and \\"Marking a Spot on the Face of Value\\" in Chapter 15.

True, he suggests all manner of strategies and tactics to overcome sales resistance based almost entirely on price. (He correctly suggests that those who buy ONLY on price be avoided. More about that later.) However, I think this book's greater value is derived from Steinmetz's systematic and convincing repudiation of various self-defeating mindsets. For example, those who are so desperate to sell (and earn some money) that they make all manner of unnecessary concessions. In effect, they negotiate against themselves. (Steinmetz: \\"Business is a game of margins, not volume.\\") Here's another example. Those who fulfill what I call the \\"Self-Fulfilling Negative Prophecy\\": They are convinced that they cannot succeed and therefore eagerly gather and then cite \\"evidence\\" to prove it. (Henry Ford: \\"Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.\\") I stopped counting but there must be at least 50 self-defeating mindsets throughout the book which Steinmetz examines and then dismisses.<br />This is NOT a sales manual. Rather, an extended dialogue between Steinmetz and those readers who are reasonably intelligent, very ambitious, highly energetic, eager to learn what they think they know but don't, not easily discouraged, and -- most important of all -- willing to consider vary carefully what Steinmetz suggests. He requires each reader to set aside their (probably cherished) assumptions about \\"salesmanship,\\" most of them based on received wisdom that is either obsolete or never true in the first place. Is selling always a \\"numbers game\\"? No and Yes. No if the percentage is based on the number of sales made as a result of cold calls to everyone in the telephone directory whose last name begins with \\"J.\\" Yes if the percentage is based on the number of sales made to carefully selected, pre-qualified prospects. True, there are differences between walk-in sales (e.g. at vehicle dealerships and department stores) and offsite sales (e.g. at the prospect's location). Even so, Steinmetz cites five \\"cases\\" (price, quality, service, competence of salesperson, and error-free delivery) which apply to both. I agree completely that \\"business is a game of margins, not volume.\\" I am also convinced that re-orders (i.e. repeat customers), not merely orders, should be a primary objective. As Steinmetz explains, price may result in one order but quality, service, competence of salesperson, and error-free delivery create and then sustain long-term customer relationships.<br />Why avoid those who buy only on price? Steinmetz offers nine reasons:<br />1. Price-buyers take all of your sales time.<br />2. They do all the complaining.<br />3. They \\"forget\\" to pay you.<br />4. They tell your other customers how little they paid you.<br />5. They drive off your good customers.<br />6. There's not going to buy from you again anyhow.<br />7. They'll require you to \\"invest up\\" to supply their needs -- and then they'll blackmail you for a better price.<br />8. They'll destroy the credibility of your price and your product in the eyes of your customers.<br />9. They will steal any ideas, designs, drawings, information, and knowledge they can get their hands on.<br />There are dozens of such checklists, step-by-step processes, reminders, dos and don'ts, cautions, and value affirmations. throughout the book as well as hundreds of examples of real-world sales situations. Problems and complications are inevitable. Steinmetz identifies the most recurrent ones and explains how to resolve them. Implicit is Steinmetz's pride in what he views as the profession of sales. He is wholeheartedly committed to quality of product and service. He understands the importance of making prudent promises and then keeping every one of them. He has little (if any) patience with whiners, chiselers, corner cutters, liars, and hypocrites. He views providingservice to customers as a privilege, indeed as a moral obligation.<br />Here in a single volume is a wealth of information and wisdom which Steinmetz has accumulated over a period of many years, presented with a non-nonsense writing style enlivened by his wry sense of humor. All of his advice is eminently practical and easily applicable to most sales situation. However, I presume to offer some advice of my own. Read and then re-read the book, highlighting or underlining whatever seems most relevant to your own situation. Then focus on your most urgent needs. That is to say, do not attempt to apply immediately everything you have learned. Experiment. Take a few prudent chances. Over time, I think you will achieve significant improvement of your skills and a stronger sense of pride in how you earn a living. One final point. Not all prospective customers are worthy of your attention and effort.

1418681:US	51147790	R1HM25FB1D0BF1	0071400834	221181086	Leadership When the Heat's On	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Revised, Updated, and Even More Valuable	This is a substantially revised and updated second edition of a book which, since first published in 1992, became and remains a bestseller. (My rough guess is that about 60% of the material this edition is new. Perhaps more.) In my Five Star review of the previous edition, I began by noting that the word \\"crucible\\" refers to a container within which tremendous pressure exists and the word is also used to describe experiencing such pressure. While writing this book with Hoover's assistance, I think Cox had this in mind when using the term \\"heat\\" in relation to leadership. Throughout history, the greatest religious, military, social, political, and business leaders have flourished under tremendous pressure.<br />According to Cox, \\"heat\\" is created at the point at which the manager finds himself or herself under the greatest pressure, emanating both from outside  (e.g. others' expectations) and inside (i.e. self-imposed forces). In fact, almost anyone within any organization finds herself or himself feeling such pressure while attempting to produce desirable results. Cox fully understands that there are many different kinds of pressure which generally fall within two categories: positive pressure which increases and improves performance without a loss of dignity, and, negative pressure which undermines performance and frequently results in anger, resentment, discouragement, and even despair.<br />Years ago when meeting with a CEO who took great pride in his \\"command and control\\" management style, I read a framed aphorism to which he directed my attention: \\"Flogging will continue until employee morale improves.\\" Cox did not write this book for such a manager; rather, for those who care deeply about their associates and are struggling to provide effective leadership and management -- or supporting their leaders and managers -- while experiencing tremendous pressure themselves from various sources (e.g. supervisors, associates, customers, and competitors). In this volume, Cox recommends the same seven strategies introduced in the previous edition. They are arranged in a sequence of  \\"Steps\\" to follow when \\"the heat's on\\": Team Building, Goal Setting, Time Planning for Higher Productivity, Keeping Morale High, Creativity, Problem Solving, and finally, Mounting [or Initiating] Change. It would be a disservice both to him and to those who read this review for me to discuss the seven \\"Steps.\\" Each must be carefully considered (a) within the context in which Cox presents it, and (b) in relation to the others which precede or follow it. Cox correctly views and explains each of them within a cohesive process. They are interdependent. He also offers an abundance of examples and illustrations of real-world situations, dos and don'ts, action steps, mental activities, checklists, etc.<br />For me, one of the most important sections is \\"Introduction: Andrews Air Force Base, July 21, 2001.\\" For ten years, Cox flew supersonic fighter planes in the United States Air Force (the F-86 Sabre, the F-102 Delta Dagger, and then the F-101 Voodoo) before embarking on his business career. In the \\"Introduction,\\" he first describes what happened last summer when he accompanied a brigadier general during the flight of an F-16 Fighting Falcon over the Atlantic Ocean. Later, he and wife Tedi celebrated his \\"supersonic day\\" by dining in the \\"Old Town\\" area of Alexandria, VA. It would be inappropriate to reveal what occurred after they were seated in an historic restaurant. Suffice to say, Cox's juxtaposition of the two situations serves to illustrate several of his most important ideas which he then develops brilliantly in the ten chapters. In fact, I think the \\"Introduction\\" all by itself is worth the price of the book.<br />Those who share my high regard for this revised and updated edition are urged to check out Bossidy and Charan's Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done, Hammer's The Agenda: What Every Business Must Do to Dominate the Decade, Maister's Practice What You Preach: What Managers Must Do to Create a High-Performance Culture, and Gilbert's Success Bound: Breaking Free of Mediocrity.ster's Practice What You Preach: What Managers Must Do to Create a High-Performance Culture, and Gilbert's Success Bound: Breaking Free of Mediocrity.	2002-09-05
1418964:US	51147790	R1ZD1LH4CVAWZD	0793153891	421366668	Getting to 'Closed': A Proven Program to Accelerate the Sales Cycle and Increase Commissions	Books	5	11	11	N	N	How to Reduce the Sales Cycle	There are several excellent books on sales and sales training. This is one of the best. It offers what I consider to be a uniquely comprehensive, cohesive, and time-effective system which Schiffman calls a \\"Prospect Management\\" program.  Apparently this system have been adopted, in some instances modified, and then implemented by more than 1,800 different organizations. I agree with Schiffman that the word \\"organizations\\" is more appropriate than \\"companies\\" because colleges,  universities, and churches as well as other non-profits must also generate substantial revenue from their respective constituencies. If anything, their need to manage their \\"prospects\\" effectively is even greater than is the need of for-profits. Benefactors, for example, must be convinced to sustain (if not increase) their financial support; volunteers must be enlisted; and staff members must \\"buy into\\" necessary changes in policy and procedure. All organizations (regardless of size or nature) will derive substantial benefit from the wealth of information and insights which he shares in this book.<br />Schiffman carefully organizes his material within three separate but interrelated Parts: The Fundamentals, Learning the System, and Getting Up and Running. The foundation of the \\"Prospect Management\\" program consists of complete and current information about prospects which is prioritized and then classified within four active stages of the sales cycle. First,  decision-makers who have agreed to a preliminary meeting; next, decision-makers who then specifically indicate interest and agree to discuss budgets and pricing; next, decision-makers who have made at least a verbal agreement; and finally, decision-makers who have become customers, (i.e. signed a contract). Schiffman also has another category, \\"Fallbacks/opportunities\\": assumed but unverified decision-makers with whom initial contact has been made but who are not as yet prospects. \\"These are candidates, suspects, leads or referrals -- people [you] want to do business with, but with whom [you] do not yet have a real relationship.\\" Because change is the only constant in today's business world, Schiffman correctly emphasizes the importance of constantly updating the prospect database. Hence the need for constantly obtaining new information. Subjected to rigorous evaluation, the information is  converted it into intelligence data which guide and inform the \\"Prospect Management\\" program.<br />As Schiffman would be the first to point out, the \\"Prospect Management\\" program as he presents it may not be wholly appropriate in all respects to a given sales organization. That is to say, decision-makers must be prepared to make whatever modifications may be necessary. For example, consider how varied sales cycles are (e.g. those for a Boeing 777, an SUV, a  major appliance, an insurance policy, or a pair of sneakers); also, the differences between and among so-called \\"inside\\" and \\"outside\\" salespersons; also,  the number of decision-makers and decision-influencers involved. Nonetheless, the basic principles of Schiffman's \\"Prospect Management\\" program remain valid no matter who is selling what to whom.<br />Some of the best material is provided within five appendices but I strongly recommend that they be read only after reading the 20 chapters which precede them. Schiffman introduces and then explains his system step-by-step. There is a continuity to his thinking which is reflected in the sequence of the material provided. With great care, he \\"walks\\" his reader through that material. Also, at the end of  the first 18 chapters, he includes a \\"Quick Quiz\\" for the reader. (The correct answers can be found after the final chapter.) If at times the narrative seems redundant (and it does), that is because there are several key points worthy of being reiterated. The accumulative impact ensures that those key points will be retained in the reader's mind long after the book has been read.<br />Obviously, I think highly of this book. However, given the importance of maximizing sales and (yes) commissions, I think salespersons and especially those who supervise them should consult several different sources of information and counsel. Therefore, I also highly recommend Rackham's SPIN Selling, Boylan's The Power to Get In, and Werth's High Probability Selling. Each of these also offers much of value. However, I again stress the importance of formulating, implementing, and then constantly fine-tuning a cohesive, comprehensive, and time-effective sales program. For that reason, I'd start with the \\"Prospect Management\\" program and modify accordingly.ly of this book.

Darwinists believe that all organisms participate in a process of natural selection. In the 21st century, organizations (like organisms) must therefore initiate or respond effectively to revolutions inorder to survive. That is, they must recognize major developments (what Kuhn calls \\"paradigm shifts,\\" what Grove calls \\"inflection points,\\" and what Gladwell calls \\"tipping points\\"), preferably before they begin. Meanwhile, prudence dictates that these organizations carefully select their terms of engagement with their competition, allocating their resources with great care.<br />I recently re-read e*Volve, curious to learn how relevant it remains in light of what has (and has not) happened since it was first published early last year. My conclusion is that it is even more relevant now than it was then. The material is based on more than 300 interviews, a survey of more than 700 companies, and various case studies developed at the Harvard Business School. Kanter and her research associates analyzed a combination of traditional companies (e,g, Arrow, Barnes & Noble, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Sun Microsystems) and what are generally referred to as \\"dot coms\\" (e.g. Amazon, EarthWeb, eBay, and Razorfish) to determine how these companies attempted to achieve success in \\"the digital culture of tomorrow.\\"<br />It would be a disservice to Kanter as well as to those who read this review to summarize the tentative conclusions which Kanter shares. (Read the book and you'll understand why such conclusions are necessarily tentative.) For me, the greater value of this book (and of all others she has written, notably When Giants Learn to Dance and Innovation) is derived from the questions she asks rather than from the answers she offers. No one else asks more probing questions than does Kanter. Why do some \\"revolutions\\" in business succeed and others fail? Which organizations (non-profits as well as for-profits) have either launched and then sustained successful \\"revolutions\\" or responded effectively to them? How and why? Within any organization, what must be allowed to \\"evolve,\\" especially in today's competitive marketplace?<br />If you are a decision-maker now struggling to answer questions such as these, I highly recommend this book. With Kanter's expert assistance, you can determine which are the most important questions your own organization must ask. She will also assist the immensely difficult process of obtaining answers to those questions. That said, I presume to offer one final word of caution, one with which I hope Kanter agrees: At all times keep in mind that both questions and answers are transient. Whether circumstances e*volve or re*volve, they change and often do so at the most inconvenient time.usiness succeed and others fail?

The best this, the best that, etc. Such debates seem inherent in our culture. Is Pauline Kael a better movie critic than James Agee? Siskel than Ebert? Ebert than Sarris? Sarris than Schickel? What about Anthony Lane and David Denby? Who the hell cares? I have read and admired all of these movie critics, sometimes agreeing with them and other times not. Each has helped me to \\"see\\" more or appreciate something less in certain films.  On occasion I adjust an opinion after a second viewing, thinking more or less highly of a film in part because of what a critic has observed.<br />While reading Anthony Lane's work in The New Yorker since 1993, I have often wished that at least his best of it be published in a single volume. That wish has now come true for me as well as for countless others. For reasons already  provided, I will not get into comparisons and contrasts with other writers (Kael, Denby, Updike, Lahr, et al) and cut to the proverbial \\"bone\\": Those who generally appreciate Lane's work will thoroughly enjoy reading this book. Those who generally dislike his work need no opinion of mine. The title refers to one of the funniest film lines ever. It is expressed by Osgood Fielding III (played by Joe E. Brown) to \\"Daphne\\" (played by Jack Lemmon) at the conclusion of Wilder's Some Like It Hot (1959). Like men dressed as women, films are not always what they seem to be.<br />Matters of agreement and disagreement about films aside, this volume also includes some of Lane's best `Profiles\\" from The New Yorker. I mention this because those who have not seen a movie since Reagan's first term in office will nonetheless appreciate Lane's formidable erudition, delicious sense of humor, and writing style of seamless precision and eloquence. It is possible to grasp the quality of Lane's thinking and writing even if you have not seen (nor plan to see) whatever film he may be discussing. I share his impatience with The English Patient but think much more of Braveheart than he does. So what? I enjoy the pleasure of Lane's (intellectual) company and appreciate the fact that I can now turn to a single volume to renew acquaintances while awaiting the next issue of The New Yorker.if you have not seen (nor plan to see) whatever film he may be discussing.

It's a terrible feeling, isn't it? Countless research studies indicate that a substantial majority of those surveyed have a greater fear of speaking in public than of dying. (This may explain the origin of the comment \\"I really died up there.\\") Here in a single volume are the thoughts, feelings, values, skills, techniques, reminiscences, and recommendations of 22 of the world's greatest public speakers. This book is a \\"must read\\" for anyone (literally anyone) who, from time to time, must prepare and then present a program of some kind to an audience.<br />Obviously, no single chapter (much less all of them) can guarantee that the reader will then be able to overcome fear or discomfort. However, after having read the entire book, the reader will then be much better prepared for whatever public presentations may be required of her or him. Advance preparation is essential and that includes such seemingly unimportant items as having a spare bulb for the overhead or slide projector; checking out the room, the seating arrangements, the room's lighting and temperature, and the sound equipment in advance; completing adequate \\"homework\\" on the audience and its expectations; and as conducting as many rehearsals as necessary to become comfortable with both the material and the flow of presenting it. I learned something of great value from each of the \\"masters\\" who contributed to this volume. Each of them has a distinctive style but all are effective communicators. Each prepares for a presentation in different ways but all believe in Murphy's Law and proceed accordingly.<br />Many of the \\"secrets\\" referred to in the book's title are just plain common sense but many others, until now, have been unknown to most people. All can be very helpful during the preparation and presentation process. Because almost everyone dreads speaking in public and so few people are any good at it, this book can provide you with a significant advantage during the progress of your career by setting you apart from (and a rung or two above) almost everyone else in your organization. It can also help you to have a much greater positive impact on those outside your organization, especially current and prospective customers. Those who are effective public speakers have much greater impact in one-to-one conversations and during group discussions. They respond more crisply and eloquently, hence more impressively, when asked direct questions. They are invariably better prepared. They speak with conviction. And they are highly persuasive. If this is the kind of impact you wish to have in all manner of situations, buy the book, read it, and then apply what you have learned in each and every situation in which you have the opportunity to communicate with someone else.crets\\" referred to in the book's title are just plain common sense but many others, until now, have been unknown to most people.

In this book, Billington discusses several of them such as James Watt, Robert Fulton, Samuel F.B. Morse, Andrew Carnegie, and Thomas Alva Edison. What makes this book even more interesting and informative is the fact that he also discusses many others about whom I previously knew little, if anything. For example, Thomas Telford (\\"the designer as artist\\"), Francis Cabot Lowell (\\"no one played a more central role in bringing the industrial revolution to the young United States\\"), J. Edgar Thompson (among the first inductees in Fortune's \\"Business Hall of Fame, together with Ford, Edison, and Morgan),  and Henry Bessemer (determined how to manufacture malleable iron and steel without fuel, thereby permitting mass production). Because of what these and other \\"pioneer innovators\\" accomplished during the 19th century, the United States emerged as the world's leading industrial nation. \\"The emergence depended...upon a series of major engineering events: the steamboat, the textile factory town [e.g. Lowell, MA], the continental railroad, electric telegraph, the iron and steel industry, the steel bridge, and the incandescent light.\\" Moreover, Billington includes all manner of graphic illustrations of major inventions and explains how that engineering \\"has transformed not only the material life of our nation but also its politics and its culture.\\" In Chapter 3, Billington suggests three competing ideas about the origins of technological innovation: \\"one, of innovation as a consequence of applied science; two,, of innovation as a response to political and economic forces; and three, of innovation as the result of individual genius.\\" Billington succeeds brilliantly in helping each reader to understand the creative thinking and the achievements of various engineering pioneers \\"who made America modern\\" as well as the origin(s) of their technological innovation.ovation.	2002-08-31

Almost 17 years later, a tragic accident occurred which resulted in the deaths of 134 men aboard. Briefly, an electrical malfunction in one of the F-4 Phantoms accidentally fired a Zuni rocket into another F-4 Phantom. Thousands of jet fuel were spilled and ignited, causing a fire could have been contained and put out, had the heat not reached -- within seconds -- and then detonated 1,000-pound \\"Composition B\\" bombs being loaded onto other planes nearby. The pilot in the F-4 Phantom hit by the rocket was John McCain, today a U.S. Senator from Arizona.<br />After more than two years of rigorous and extensive research, which included dozens of lengthy interviews of eyewitnesses, Freeman learned why it happened and how the Forrestal's crew responded so capably and courageously but that is only part of the riveting, heart-wrenching account he provides in this book. He also learned of the government's efforts to conceal the truth about conscious and unconscionable decisions made by government and naval officials which preceded the tragedy; worse yet, the captain, Rear Admiral John K. Beling, and his crew were made scapegoats for the consequences of those decisions. Since then, every new sailor joining the Navy undergoes firefighting training that includes a film depicting the Forrestal fire and blaming it on its crew. Until recently, members of the crew and their families knew nothing of the evidence that vindicates them and thus, for decades, have been required to bear a burden of guilt and humiliation which they obviously do not deserve. Today, Freeman explains,<br />\\"The Navy maintains the Forrestal in a Rhode Island shipyard, the gray hulk sitting quietly in the water with no visitors and no crew, waiting as her veterans continue efforts to turn the ship into a museum. The 12134 men who died on the Forrestal on July 29, 1967, are memorialized on panel 24E of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. Close by at Arlington National Cemetery, there is a monument to those never recovered or identified after the disaster, just behind the Tomb of the Unknowns.\\"<br />As Freeman completed his research and then began to write this book, he felt a profound sense of obligation to those who were aboard the USS Forrestal that day as well as to others who served on the ship during its 38 years as a commissioned warship. At a Forrestal reunion he attended, Freeman was urged by nearly every veteran \\"to do right by these guys. They really deserve it.\\" Later, during his return home, Freeman realized \\"that it is no small feat to to tell the stories of 134 men who died an early death, and of the thousands of [other] men on the ship who suffered in so many ways\\" both then and in years to come.<br />In writing this book, Freeman not only fulfilled his obligation to the heroic crew of the USS Forrestal, he also increases significantly our understanding and appreciation of those who, in various military services for more than 200 years, have served their nation with high honor and exceptional courage.on July 29, 1967, are memorialized on panel 24E of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C.

1427321:US	51147790	R2EZJQA478OG10	0750699914	565962457	The Rhythm of Business	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Expertise and Process in Harmony	With Rottenberg, Shuman has written a book which supports this basic assertion: that each business has a rhythm: \\"how all businesses develop and it is the beat to which all business flows.\\" What does this mean? At first, I did not understand and suspected gobbledygook so I re-read the Introduction and then I got it: each business has a way of taking on a life and pace of its own, more often than not different from what its founder(s) originally had in mind. This \\"life\\" is shaped by several different influences, many of which could not have been anticipated. Changes in the competitive marketplace, for example, or new regulatory legislation or the loss of a key executive or ofa major account. As with humans, no two companies have the same \\"life.\\" More to the point, children seldom develop into adolescence and then adulthood precisely the way their parents expected or at least hoped.<br />So, what to do? Good question. In the Introduction, Shuman provides three brief quotations of Peter Drucker, Leo Kahn, and Barry Diller. Collectively, their remarks suggest that decision-makers in any organization (regardless of nature or size) should lead and manage to the best of their ability, of course, but understrand -- and accept -- the fact that the process of business can be influenced and directed but not kept under total control. Imagine taking an 800-pound domesticated tiger out for a walk in the neighborhood. You have him on a leash. Who's taking whom for a walk? If I understand Shuman correctly, this analogy is apt.<br />He organizes his material within three Parts: The Rhythm of Business, Learning to Feel the Rhythm, and Let the Dance Begin. At the end of each of the ten chapters, he provides a list of Key Points. The repetition of key points throughout the book is somewhat irritating but probably achieves Shuman's objective. Those who have read the book can easily review the lists of Key Points later as well as Shuman's definition of \\"the rhythm of business\\" on page 5. With regard to what is needed, Shuman identifies these six requirements:<br />1. You need, at least, some natural skills.<br />2. You need to work hard and practice.<br />3. You need a basic understanding of the mechanics of the business you are in.<br />4. You need to gather informnation about your business.<br />6. You need to love your business with a passion.<br />Obviously, there is nothing original about these \\"requirements.\\" What differentiates  this book from most other books I have read on the same general subject (i.e. building an organization which sustains its success) is Shuman's concept of \\"rhythm.\\" Recall the metaphor I presumed to share earlier. Like a tiger, an organization will not always \\"follow directions,\\" \\"go where you want it to go,\\" \\"submit itself totally to your will,\\" etc. The challenge is to understand the beast, to trust its instincts, to nourish as well as manage its strength, and channel its energy while allowing it to fulfill its own destiny, whatever that proves to be. I know all this may sound corny but I really do not know how else to explain my \\"take\\" on Shuman's concept.<br />Shuman repeatedly stresses the importance of business being customer-driven and I agree. (I think business should also be employee- or associate-driven. If you don't take good care of your people, you will lose the best and the brightest, be left with the donkeys and hamsters, and your customers will by then have gone away.) The term \\"rhythm of business\\" should not be applied too narrowly. In fact, what Shuman is really talking about involves a multiple of entities (employees, customers, vendors, service providers, etc.) each of which has its own \\"rhythm.\\" Moreover, the combination of these entities generates its own \\"rhythm.\\" Imagine giving a bubble bath to ten 900-pound tigers at the same time. That is not exactly what George Gershwin had in mind when he composed &quot;I Got Rhythm.&quot;<br />Also with Rottenberg's assistance, Shuman later co-authored twoother books with Janice Twombley which develop this idea in much greater depth: Collaborative Communities and then more recently, Everyone Is a Customer. Those who share my high regard for this book are strongly urged to read the other two. Who could ask for anything more?ooks with Janice Twombley which develop this idea in much greater depth: Collaborative Communities and then more recently, Everyone Is a Customer.

Frankly, I did not know what to expect and certainly did not expect what it provides. At this point, please allow me a brief, obviously personal digression. All of what I write is non-fiction. Those who have had the greatest impact on my writing style include George Orwell and E.B. White. (I assume full responsibility, of course, for the gap between the quality of their writing and mine.) There is also the matter of getting one's work published. I do not recall a prior time when competition has been greater. Hence the importance of cultivating contacts, preferably with the guidance of a literary agent. We all know how many manuscripts of eventual bestsellers (especially novels) have been repeatedly rejected prior to publication. So there are the matters of influences on one's craftsmanship and the process of getting one's work published. See suggests another: self-promotion. Throughout this book, she offers all manner of strategies and tactics by which to ingratiate one's self with decision-makers and decision-influencers within the publishing world. For example, systematically sending to them what she calls \\"paper airplanes of affection\\" expressing praise and appreciation.<br />Most of the recommended initiatives seem more relevant to a celebrity author wannabe than to an aspiring writer of serious fiction or non-fiction. Most of them seem to me to be inappropriate, if not rude. Perhaps I'm missing something but See apparently endorses, indeed stridently advocates behavior reminiscent of Frasier Crane's literary agent Bebe Glazer, brilliantly portrayed by Harriet Sansom Harris. Does See really expect her readers to believe such behavior is what it takes to succeed as a writer? For example, wandering through halls and even private offices to secure assignments, uninvited and unescorted, after having been denied access by  some \\"---hole\\"? That may provide interesting material for a film or sit com script...but seems counter-productive for a writer who wants her or his work to be taken seriously.<br />Frankly, based only on what See says in this book (I have not read any of her other works), I cannot take her seriously IF she's serious. But you never know. (I wrote a Five Star review of Carol Gilligan's The Birth of Pleasure. I thought it was hilarious,  describing it as a \\"brilliant satire\\" worthy of Swift, only to be informed later that she is serious so I withdrew the review. Like I said, you just never know.) See claims to have written this book for \\"the timid, forlorn, and clueless,\\" thereby positioning herself as the literary world's equivalent of the State of Liberty. If in the unlikely event this book does indeed give such people courage, hope, and wisdom, presumably they will be among the multitude which See hopes will stop by and say \\"hi\\" as she lies dying, her body sedated with \\"euphoric painkilling drugs.\\" I'm not making this stuff up. It's in the book.<br />For serious writers in need of guidance with regard to craftsmanship, I still recommend just about anything written by George Orwell and E.B. White, especially their essays. For a book of advice specifically on the writing process, my #1 choice is the latest edition of William Zinnser's On Writing Well. Stephen King's On Writing could also be of substantial value, especially the second half.  (To be fair, I should point out that See does provide some basic ideas concerning plot, character, tone, setting, etc.) With regard to getting published, I strongly recommend having a reputable literary agent. (The best of them select writers to represent, not the other way around.) They have a highly developed \\"sniffer\\" to detect talent (albeit it raw) and have earned the respect and trust of acquisitions editors at reputable publishing houses. I realize that it may take a while (sometimes a long while) to obtain the services of an agent.<br />Meanwhile, what to do? My own advice is to keep writing and (especially) rewriting, soliciting reactions but only from those who will say quite frankly what they think. Here's another idea. Serious unpublished writers invariably have their own favorite writers. Amazon.com offers dozens of books written by prominent authors who candidly discuss their careers, including their struggles. Of greatest value is what they have to say about their craftsmanship.<br />It seems appropriate to conclude with Rod Steiger's reply when asked if aspiring actors sought his advice. \\"Oh sure, of course. All the time. And I always look them in the eye and ask the same question. `Do you want to be an actor or do you have to be [have to be in italics] an actor?' The longer it takes them to answer, the less likely that they'll ever make it.\\" That is probably also true of aspiring writers. My opinion (just an opinion) is that those who are \\"timid, forlorn, and clueless\\" won't make it either.My own advice is to keep writing and (especially) rewriting, soliciting reactions but only from those who will say quite frankly what they think.

Hutcheson draws upon a wealth of real-world business experience, first during the years when he went to work part-time as a telemarketer at Olin Mills, Inc. (which his grandfather founded), eventually heading the Olin Mills Portrait Studios; and then after he left Olin Mills to found his own company, ReGENERATION Partners. The range and depth of his practical experience in the business are thus extensive. The nine \\"Keys\\" Hutcheson shares in this book are based on personal experience, not theory. What also differentiates this book from most others I've read is Hutcheson's consistent emphasis on both human value and human potentiality. He understands full well that one of the greatest challenges decision-makers now face in their organizations (regardless of size or nature) is to help ordinary people produce extraordinary results... and do so in collaboration with others. Hence the importance of respect for human dignity in any workplace. Hence the importance of a manager's faith in human potentiality. Throughout his book, Hutcheson affirms that respect and faith in no uncertain terms.<br />With regard to the nine \\"Keys\\" themselves, no news there. They could just as easily be seven (Covey) or 21 (Maxwell). Everyone is in favor of building companies that last, believes that companies need effective leadership, that a meritocracy is preferable to anarchy, etc. Of course, Hutcheson makes no claim that his \\"Keys\\" are \\"Secrets.\\" Again, what sets his book apart from so many others is the meticulous care with which he presents and discusses the \\"Keys\\" in terms of achieving and then sustaining maximum value in an organization. Because there is a continuity to his thought processes when developing his ideas, the chapters should be read in sequence.<br />With regard to the \\"Portraits,\\" Hutcheson \\"paints\\" several. Those I found of greatest value are of Legend Airlines (which illustrates the power of \\"fable\\") and Southwest Airlines (which illustrates the importance of \\"traditions, myths, and shared beliefs\\"); also, those of the New York Yankees, Dell Computer, and Katz's Deli. (Katz's Deli? Yes. Read Chapter 7 in which Hutcheson explains why it is imperative to \\"give the next generation room to grow.\\") Frankly, I was surprised to encounter a discussion of Dennis Rodman in Chapter 2. What's he doing in this book? Hutcheson explains why. He tells his own \\"business story\\" in the Preface and then concludes the book with \\"Closing Reflections.\\" The tone and style of the narrative throughout made this reader feel that I was engaged with Hutcheson in a personal, albeit one-way conversation. (So many other business books seem to be an anthology of graduate school lectures.) Credit Hutcheson with having a caring personality as well as a sense of humor.<br />Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book? Certainly decision-makers in who need to increase and sustain the value of their organizations. Also founders of family-owned businesses who have an urgent need for assistance with succession planning while growing the business. Also those in charge of business units and even departments within large organizations if the operations for which these executives are responsible are underperforming (i.e. not adding sufficient value to the parent).<br />Finally, I highly recommend this book to those who have recently embarked on a business career. Why? Because it will be to their great advantage to understand the importance of what I call \\"value-adding effort,\\" of what Napoleon Hill once referred to as \\"going the extra mile.\\" When each of our three sons and then our daughter embarked on a business career, I offered only two pieces of advice: \\"Love whatever you do to earn a living\\" and `Become indispensable to your employer.\\" I wish Hutcheson's bookhad been available to them then. Countless others will be grateful that it is available to them now.k had been available to them then. Countless others will be grateful that it is available to them now.	2002-08-26

Almost all of her readers can experience Southern Africa only vicariously by reading books, examining photographs, and viewing films. However, all of her readers can (if they wish) be inspired by her self-explorations to embark on their own. In this context, it may seem somewhat paradoxical that through meditation, a person transcends the unsurpassed natural beauty of Southern Africa. In fact, as Evans explains, there is no paradox at all. On the contrary, only through meditation can one fully understand and appreciate the essential unity of the physical and spiritual realms. Consider this excerpt from the final chapter in which Evans suggests that there are few differences between \\"the most highly enlightened beings\\" and the Bushmen of the Kalahari:<br />\\"Both have no need for possessions and are detached from the material world. Both need very little clothing. Both eat very frugally, so frugally in fact that any other person on such a diet would become ill and starve to death. Both have highly developed intuitive powers and psychic abilities. Both very often have out of body experiences. The Bushmen through their dance rituals, the enlightened through meditation. Both have perceptive abilities that cross time and space. Both very often can predict their own time of death. It is a well-known fact that when a Bushman decides to die, he simply sits down and does so. Both are as wise as serpents, as gentle as doves. And so, the beginning and the end become at one and we regain the freedom and purity of heart and mind that we once had.\\"<br />I include this excerpt for two reasons. First, it describes what could be at least a spiritual destination for many of those who read this book. Evans explains what various \\"journeys\\" require and suggests how to experience the greatest personal development while embarked on them. Second, for many who roam the aisles in book stores or who note the extensive cross references which Amazon.com provides, this book may not attract their attention. (I learned of it only by chance.)

The tragic events of September 11th offer a number of examples. The most publicized involves those aboard United flight 93 which crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. While huddled to the rear of the plane, several called loved ones; Todd Beamer spoke at length with an GTE-Verizon operator and, together, they recited the Lord's Prayer. She then heard Beamer ask \\"Are you guys ready? Let's roll!\\" By then, Beamer and his fellow passengers knew the fate of the other three skyjacked planes and rushed the cockpit. The plane crashed. Everyone aboard died.<br />What we have here is a combination of transcriptions of cell phone calls and the \\"black box\\" tapes, mini-biographies, obituaries, reminiscences by the victims' relatives and friends, and Longman's own highly skillful analysis of what he learned during his extensive research. It is possible but unlikely that much more information about specific developments during the flight will be forthcoming. Lisa Beamer has already written one book and, over time, I think others among the victims' relatives and friends will also share their own thoughts and feelings about the impact on them following the crash of United flight 93.<br />A chronicle such as this helps to give \\"human faces\\" to the victims' names. The same is true of a special section {\\"A Nation Challenged\\") which the New York Times published each day from September 15th until February 5th. A total of 1,800 \\"portraits of grief\\" were eventually featured. (This material is now available in a single volume, Portraits of 9/11/01: The Collected \\"Portraits of Grief\\" from the New York Times.) Obviously, heroism was demonstrated by so many people throughout and following the four skyjackings. The general public knows almost nothing about what happened aboard the first three flights and not much more about the fourth. For example, at what point did at least some of 93's passengers decide to rush the cockpit? Assuming Beamer was their leader, who else accompanied him? Then what happened? What aboiut the United flight crew? For me, such details are far less significant than the fact that people very much like those with whom I have traveled on numerous flights over the years became \\"citizen soldiers\\" and responded courageously to what must have been a terrifying crisis. Because of Longman's book and the \\"portraits of grief,\\" it is possible to appreciate what Stephen Ambrose has characterized as \\"uncommon valor.\\"hat point did at least some of 93's passengers decide to rush the cockpit?

Also, each provides a concise but insightful examination of the subject's life and career. As Smiley explains in her Preface, \\"The literary sensibility of Charles Dickens is possibly the most amply documented literary sensibility in history.\\" Quite true. Smiley goes on to suggest that, over time, Dickens' readers have become further and further removed from the details of his life. Nonetheless, while they continue to read any of fifteen novels (ten of which exceed 800 pages in length) as well as stories, articles, travel pieces, essays, letters, etc., they remain \\"in his presence, experiencing his process of thought and imagination as it precipitates inchoate idea to particular word.\\" It is this \\"miracle of literature\\" which Smiley finds especially interesting as she approaches Dickens in this volume with \\"a friendly desire to get to know him and to achieve what Victorians might have termed `a growing intimacy.'\\" In my opinion, Smiley's approach is the eminently correct one to take. Here are three brief excerpts from the narrative which suggest the eloquence and precision of Smiley's analysis:<br />\\"Along with A Christmas Carol, Oliver Twist is probably the best known of Dickens's narratives, certainly because, like many of Dickens's own works and like many other nineteenth century novels, it was reworked for the stage, where the simple and vivid story of the workhouse child who falls among thieves and then is rescued and restored to his wealthy grandfather made a dramatic and cohesive play. The arc of the narrative is fairy tale-like, but the details of Oliver's companions and surroundings come directly from Dickens's immediate world.\\"<br />\\"The Old Curiosity Shop is Dickens's most interesting novel in terms of the extremes of reactions it elicits in readers. Legendarily popular and lucrative in its day, it is now impossible for many to read, even those who are devoted Dickensians. Oscar Wilde remarked, `One must have a heart of stone to read the death of Nell without laughing.' and others have been at least as critical.\\"<br />\\"Some novelists plow the same field novel after novel. Others map the world. No novelist has mapped so much of the world, right at the borderline where the inner world and the outer world meet, as Charles Dickens. He has inexhaustibly delineated states of mind, emotions, symbols, ideas, the rational life, and the irrational life, but also London and Kent and Manchester and America and Italy and France and Scotland and Essex and Norfolk.

Frankly, I am unable to appreciate the full nature and extent of Lisa Beamer's grief, following the death of her husband and others aboard United flight 93. As she explains in this book, her primary challenge since then has been to overcome that grief while somehow providing for the needs of their three children. Daughter Morgan was born in January, only a few months after United flight 93 crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.<br /><br />Although she has written a bestseller, and continues to attract media attention, Lisa Beamer remains focused on her children and the work of the Todd M. Beamer Foundation whose mission is to assist other children who have also lost a parent. The title of her book refers to her late husband's last recorded remarks just before he and others aboard the plane attempted to overcome the terrorists who had skyjacked it. (&#34;Are you guys ready? Let's roll!&#34;) They knew what had already happened on September 11th whereas those aboard the other three flights did not. Huddled to the rear of their plane, several were able to call loved ones and then recited the Lord's Prayer before rushing the forward area.<br /><br />Those who read this book expecting a detailed account of those final moments will be disappointed. (That is why I highly recommend Longman's book.) What Lisa Beamer shares in this book is her abiding religious faith, probably without which she could not cope with the loss of her beloved husband. She is also determined to help others to understand who her late husband was and why his heroism is &#34;so Todd.&#34; She suggests that he was &#34;more than a half hour of time on September 11.&#34; Of course, the same can be said of everyone else aboard that flight as well as of those aboard the other three flights and of everyone else who perished at the World Trade Center and at the Pentagon.<br /><br />It has been less than a year since the multiple of tragedies occurred and it may be several decades before we will be able to fully grasp the nature and extent of heroism both in the air and on the ground throughout that tragic day...and during the weeks which followed. Lisa Beamer has written an inspirational account of her own experiences. Although apparently there have been indications at least some resentment of her celebrity, with which she seems to be uncomfortable, she observes that &#34;I haven't gotten that sense on my interactions with the other families. I do my best to say what happened on that plane was teamwork, that there are a lot of untold stories and other heroes&#34; aboard United flight 93. Perhaps in time, we will learn more about them. Perhaps those &#34;untold stories&#34; will be added to Todd Beamer's.<br /><br />My final comment is that, now more than ever before, we need to re-define heroism so as to include otherwise &#34;ordinary&#34; people who, when faced with a life-threatening crisis, respond with extraordinary courage. May our beloved nation always have Todd Beamers to accept that challenge...and Lisa Beamers to help us to appreciate them.of tragedies occurred and it may be several decades before we will be able to fully grasp the nature and extent of heroism both in the air and on the ground throughout that tragic day...and during the weeks which followed.

My final comment is that, now more than ever before, we need to re-define heroism so as to include otherwise &#34;ordinary&#34; people who, when faced with a life-threatening crisis, respond with extraordinary courage. May our beloved nation always have Todd Beamers to accept that challenge...and Lisa Beamers to help us to appreciate them.	2002-08-20

They are victims of what he calls \\"FAILURE-itis.\\" Gilbert speaks from his own experience from which he learned 21 strategies \\"to turn stumbling blocks into stepping stones, solve any problem, overcome any obstacles, and achieve any goal\\" he could set for himself. Having the benefit of what Gilbert shares in this book, will it then be easy for anyone else to do so? Of course not. The journey to success (however one defines it) involves overcoming numerous and formidable barriers; there are great perils along the way; and not everyone embarked on that journey eventually completes it. In this context, I am reminded of Henry Ford's observation: \\"Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.\\" Hence the importance of having a positive attitude, a confidence in one's abilities, and a determination (preferably a tenacity) to achieve success, once embarked.<br />Gilbert carefully organizes his 21 strategies within four Parts: Rainbows After the Rain (i.e. viewing \\"failure\\" within an appropriate context from the right perspective), Wisdom for Young and Old (i.e. leveraging knowledge from failure to gain wisdom), Shatter the Glass Ceiling (i.e. replacing a fear of failure with an appreciation of benefits to be derived from what it reveals), and Free to Live and Love (i.e. how to \\"fail in love\\" and thereby nourish an \\"active faith\\"). I hope my parenthetical i.e. comments do not incorrectly suggest that Gilbert advocates a soft-headed, \\"feel good,\\" \\"You can do it!\\" approach. On the contrary, make no mistake bout it, he fully understands how difficult it is to overcome negativism and despair  with positive, affirmative values. As he candidly acknowledges in this book, it took him years to do so. His own journey to success continues. His life remains a \\"work in progress,\\" as is everyone else's.<br />Throughout the book, Gilbert includes dozens of especially relevant quotations (from diverse sources as Thomas Edison, S.I. Hayakawa, Napoleon Hill, Dale Carnegie, Stephen Covey, Robert Allen, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Benjamin Franklin) which help to illustrate as well as support the key ideas with which he concludes each chapter. Some readers may be uncomfortable with Gilbert's frequent references to basic tenets of his Christian faith. Frankly, I commend him for sharing them. His purpose is to place proper emphasis on spiritual values whatever each reader's religious faith (if any) may be. Those captive to mediocrity tend to be self-preoccupied and frequently view themselves as victims of forces over which they have little (if any) control. Connors, Smith, and Hickman have much of value to say about this in The Oz Principle: Getting Results Through Individual and Organizational Accountability. One of the most important assertions in this book is that each person not only can but should determine what her or his purpose in life is. Gilbert is totally convinced that each of us \\"is meant to succeed in life. It is our destiny.\\" He goes on to quote Thoreau: \\"Men are born to succeed, not to fail.\\" Gilbert is thoroughly convinced that success is a human birthright. It remains for each person to decide what to do with that birthright.<br />It is possible but unlikely that every person who reads this book will immediately embark on a journey to fulfill her or his human potential but several will.  Some will then become discouraged because of a fear of failure, others because of a fear of success. The strategies which Gilbert shares obviously offer no guarantee of success but they do provide valuable perspectives on human nature which, I am convinced, will help many people to free themselves from self-imposed limits, to become more forgiving of themselves and therefore of others, to turn at least some stumbling blocks into stepping stones, to solve at least some problems, to overcome at least some obstacles, and to achieve at least some goals. Gilbert would be the first to insist that his own \\"journey\\" is still underway. Problems and obstacles await him as he proceeds.<br />There is no \\"right time\\" for anyone to embark on such a journey except now, this moment. That is a commitment only each of us can make.

According to Epstein, a snob \\"fears contamination from those he deems beneath him.\\" Curious about the word's etymology, I checked John Ayto's Dictionary of Word Origins. Although the origins of the word `\\"snob\\" apparently remain a mystery, I learned that the word eventually became associated with a shoemaker. \\"Cambridge University students of the late 18th century took it over as a slang term for a `townsman, not a member of the university'...[forming the basis] in the 1830s for the emergence of the new general sense 'member of the lower orders.'\\" My own experience suggests that snobs can be either those who insist on their gentility and (by implication) their superiority or those who aspire to it (wannabes). If I understand Epstein's purposes in this volume (and I may not), he discusses the general subject as a means by which to share his own observations about all manner of snobbish attitudes and behavior (especially his own) in contemporary society. Throughout the book, he functions as his reader's travel agent, tour guide, and advisor while providing a wealth of anecdotes and quotations along the way, explaining what he makes of them.<br /><br />Of special interest to me is Epstein's suggestion that, as American society became more egalitarian following World War Two and (especially) during the 1960s, \\"the American version\\" of snobbery democratized materialism and status-seeking in ways and to an extent without precedent. If the goal of the snob is to \\"gain and maintain a place from which to look down on all but a handful of his countrymen,\\" what Epstein characterizes as \\"essential WASP institutions\\" (e.g. previously exclusive colleges, and country clubs) became accessible to increasingly greater numbers of people. May we therefore conclude that the snob population increased exponentially? Or that the standards of WASP elitism have been compromised? Or perhaps both? Insofar as the historical material which Epstein provides is concerned, it often seems underdeveloped or overextended...and seldom essential to his purposes. Moreover, I wish he offered more to help me answer questions such as these:<br /><br />1. How does a snob differ from someone who has very high standards?<br /><br />2. To what extent (if any) are snobs harmful to others?<br /><br />3. Is reverse snobbery simply another form of snobbery?<br /><br />4. How does status-seeking differ from ambition and self-improvement?<br /><br />5. Do snobs share common needs, fears, and insecurities?<br /><br />That said, I found this book to be a highly entertaining, in large measure because of dozens of quotations in combination with Epstein's own observations such as his  suggestion that Walter Cronkite is \\"a platitudinarian and a man with a face only a nation can love.\\" I am grateful to Epstein for the enjoyment his book provides, wishing he had also included more enlightenment as well. More should be expected of an alumnus of Chicago. At least that's the opinion of this alumnus of New Haven.or overextended...and seldom essential to his purposes.

Following the Afterword by Gordon Bell (author of High-Tech Ventures: The Guide for Entrepreneurial Success), there are seven especially valuable appendices whose subjects range from \\"VBO Business Plan Elements\\" to \\"Partner Profile Template.\\" The acronym VBO refers to \\"Venture Business Office\\" which, as the authors explain in the Preface, is a demilitarized zone\\" which \\"connects the big company, the outside venture community, and start-ups. whether they emerge from inside or outside the corporate walls. The VBO is the logical conduit between [and among] these very different yet potentially synergistic worlds.\\"<br />The authors provide in this single volume a comprehensive, cohesive, and cost-effective (four-stage, step-by-step) process by which to derive maximum value from the aforementioned \\"convergence.\\" Along the way, they include dozens of charts (\\"Figures\\"), micro-case studies which illustrate various innovation initiatives, checklists, summaries, \\"Key Lessons,\\" and (in the appendices) just about everything anyone would need to know about the design, establishment, and development of a VBO. Presumably, many of those who read this brilliant book are involved with organizations (including corporations) which either do not need or cannot afford a VBO worthy of the name. Nonetheless, there is an abundance of information and advice which would be of great value to them. I also highly recommend this book to others now involved in start-ups or not-yet--mature organizations as well as to venture capitalists, management consultants, and other service providers (e.g. bankers, attorneys, and accountants) who can -- and indeed should -- be included in venturing initiatives.<br />In their Preface, Mason and Rohner suggest that \\"there is an opportunity to learn from the successes of venturing and create tools, organizational structures, processes, and -- most important -- a point of view that will make venturing work for most companies that are willing to take the matter seriously -- as one that may ultimately amount to corporate life or death.\\" They realize that a VBO may not be appropriate for many organizations.

I also think that all of the twelve \\"Rules\\" he identifies and then explains are directly relevant to internal and (especially) external communications wholly unrelated to media relations. It would be a disservice to both Mathis and to those who read this review to list the dozen. Each should be carefully considered within the context in which Mathis presents it. They meet a variety of needs which include but are not limited to media relations. Mathis does indeed enable his reader to gain a \\"systematic understanding of how all publicity works,\\" a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system which is \\"easy to learn, easy to remember, and easy to apply.\\" In aggregate, they comprise what Mathis calls a \\"Media Rules methodology.\\" Mathis suggests (and I agree) that most readers already know most of what he advocates. If true, why read his book? Good question. My response is this: Learning what to do with what we already know will determine the value of that knowledge. The 12 Rules are based on common sense in combination with the Golden Rule. Inorder to attract favorable attention and to achieve a desired objective, it is imperative to keep in mind that the media as well as business associates are generally handicapped by limitations (e.g. time), harried (e.g. by pressures and distractions), hungry (i.e. to improve their circumstances), and human (e.g. sensitive to perceived neglect and abuse). As Mathis explains, the \\"Beast\\" is an all-encompassing term \\"for the system that pushes the news gathering process.\\" Perhaps Mathis would agree with me that \\"Beast\\" can also be used as an all-encompassing term for the community or communities within which one earns a living. The second \\"Beast\\" must also be \\"fed\\" with courtesy and consideration as well as with information and other resources.<br />Mathis divides the dozen Rules within four categories: Seducers (which attract attention amidst ever-increasing \\"clutter\\"), Enablers (preparation, simplicity, and repetition), Aggressors (which sustain initiatives), and Hazards (obviously, excesses and perils to be avoided). Mathis explains both HOW and WHY each of the 12 Rules is essential; also, HOW and WHY the 12 Rules are related, indeed interdependent. Throughout his book, he provides dozens of real-world examples to illustrate key points which include don'ts as well as do's. (Many years ago, I headed the regional PR operations of a huge advertising agency. I now regret that those don'ts and do's had been available to me then.)  This is neither a textbook nor a manual, although Mathis does include at least some \\"how to do it\\" guidance.<br />For whom will this book be most valuable? First and foremost, those who are primarily responsible within their respective organizations for establishing and then nourishing cordial and mutually beneficial relationships with the media. It is important for many readers to understand that, if the Mathis' Media Rules are carefully and consistently followed, even small companies can obtain substantial and favorable publicity. Long ago, John Hill defined public relations as \\"truth well-told.\\" I agree. Moreover, for most organizations, there are many different \\"publics\\" (other than the media) with which to establish and then nourish mutually-beneficial relationships: \\"stakeholders\\" such as employees, customers, vendors and suppliers, and service providers as well as shareholders. Hospitals also have patients among their \\"publics\\"; schools, colleges, and universities have alumni and benefactors among theirs. All of Mathis' Media Rules can also ensure \\"truth well-told\\" to these various constituencies<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read Bossidy and Charan's Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done as well as Hammer's The Agenda: What Every Business Must Do to Dominate the Decade and Maister's Practice What You Preach: What Managers Must Do to Create a High-Achievement Culture.ou Preach: What Managers Must Do to Create a High-Achievement Culture.	2002-08-13

I consider it ironic and (yes) unfair that Gielgud is best-known for his role in the movie, Arthur. What if he had made no movies at all? Would anyone write a 580-page biography of him? Even in that event, would anyone read it, much less review it? The subtitle is especially apt, given Gielgud's comment \\"My work is my life [italics] and I have no other interests.\\" Of course that is somewhat (but not much) of an overstatement by someone who, on or off the stage or screen, was so essentially theatrical. Croall guides his reader through the length of Gielgud's career, focusing almost entirely on him rather than, for example, correlating biographical information within a narrative about the society and the performing arts in which Gielgud was so involved.<br />Croall necessarily discusses Gielgud's homosexuality and does so with intelligence and sensitivity. This dimension of his private life is of interest to me, frankly, only insofar as it helps me to gain a better understanding and appreciation of an actor so compelling on stage or screen. It remains for Croall and others better qualified than I am to suggest to what extent Gielgud's homosexuality guided and nourished his talent.<br />Of all that Croall reveals about Gielgud, the qualities I found most appealing are his kindness, generosity, and moral courage. There are dozens of examples of each. I was also amazed to learn the nature and extent of his career which began in 1921 and continued almost until his death in 2000 at the age of 96. Croall interviewed more than 100 of those who knew Gielgud best. It is worth noting that most of his co-workers were among his closest and most devoted personal friends. True to character, he endured criticism and betrayal by others with uncommon style and grace. Even after his beloved companion John Perry left him for the producer Binkie Beaumont, for example, Gielgud continued to assist Perry's career, directing and acting in plays he had written. In comparable circumstances, few others would have been so forgiving, much less so supportive. Gielgud's life does indeed illustrate both theatricality and humanity of the very highest quality.nd grace.

They correlate L. Frank Baum's plot and characters with situations in the contemporary business world  inorder to answer this question: How can accountability enable individuals and thereby their organizations to achieve the results they seek? The metaphor is developed as follows: The Yellow-Brick Road: \\"Getting Stuck in the Victim Cycle\\"; There's No Place Like Home: \\"Focusing on Results\\"; The Lion: \\"Mustering the Courage to Accept Accountability\\" The Tin Woodsman: \\"Finding the Heart to `Own' Accountability for One's Self\\"; The Scarecrow: \\"Obtaining the Wisdom to Assume Full Responsibility for Solving One's Problems\\"; and Dorothy: \\"Exercising the Means Needed to Solve Those Problems.\\"<br />Granted, Dorothy and her three companions (four if counting Toto) proceed together on the journey to the Emerald City and, along the way, depend upon each other to overcome all manner of obstacles. However, keep in mind that the Emerald City is not the ultimate objective for any of them. Dorothy's, for example, is to return home to Kansas. The purpose of that journey, Baum suggests, is to learn what they do not know inorder to recognize what they already have.<br />The authors suggest that the same is true of most (if not all) of those who comprise a \\"cult\\" of victimization which ducks responsibility while telling everyone else what to do. According to Charles Sykes, \\"Crisscrossing the trip wires of emotional, racial, sexual, and psychological grievance, American life is increasingly characterized by the plaintive insistence, I am a victim.\\" (Those with any direct and extensive experience with 4-7 year olds immediately recognize this as the adult version of \\"the blame game.\\") Connors, Smith, and Hickman examine what they characterize as \\"the destructive force of victimization\\" and suggest a step-by-step process by which to overcome it. Specifically, they explain HOW to proceed from consciously or unconsciously avoiding accountability for individual or collective results \\"Below the Line\\" to accepting accountability for individual and collective performance \\"Above the Line.\\" I agree with the authors that a majority of workers choose to believe that they have no control over their jobs. They view themselves -- and justify themselves -- as \\"victims of circumstance.\\"<br />This book can be invaluable both to individuals and to teams because it will help them to understand how and why \\"the destructive force of victimization\\" results in low productivity, customer dissatisfaction, ineffectiveness, wasted talent, and dysfunctional teams. Those who saw the film no doubt recall the scene in which Dorothy and her companions learn that the Wizard of Oz has no magical powers whatsoever. Only then do they grasp the meaning and importance of the Oz Principle: Assume full responsibility for your thoughts, feelings, actions, and results inorder to direct and control your destiny. Most of those who see themselves as victims have a choice: remain \\"Below the Line\\" and suffer while blaming others for that suffering, or, rise \\"Above the Line\\" to fulfill what Maslow describes as \\"self-actualization.\\" In this thought-provoking as well as eloquent book, the authors explain HOW to rise above denial, self-pity, and recrimination; better yet, HOW to to draw upon sources of wisdom and strength within to achieve health, happiness, and prosperity.

That is, to help them to motivate themselves. That is precisely what the most effective military, political, and religious leaders have done throughout history. One of the keys is appealing to what is generally described as \\"enlightened self-interest.\\" With all due respect to charismatic leaders, those who are inspired to follow generally do so for reasons of their own. Hiam seems to have this in mind as he explains \\"how to lead and succeed in business.\\" Obviously, the core concept in this book is based on the aphorism that \\"you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink.\\" A corollary to that would be something to the effect that thirst -- rather than threat -- is essential to the consumption of whatever \\"water\\" may be offered. At the risk of mixing metaphors, I am convinced that those who are \\"hungriest\\" to achieve whatever the goal may be generally succeed.<br />In the Introduction, Hiam explains that a stable represents a lot of potential energy that isn't much use to anyone until its harnessed to some worthwhile goal and encouraged to work under good leadership.\\" He goes on to suggest the same is true of organizations. They may have a great bunch of people on the payroll, a winning `stable' if you will. But without the right touch on the reins, the business produces little more than a stable full of horses. (In fact, like a stable, it actually consumes [italics] in its resting state. Anything it produces is waste product, to put it politely.)\\"<br />He then carefully organizes his excellent material within ten chapters which comprise two \\"Books. The first is \\"A Leadership Fable: The Horse Who Wouldn't Drink\\"; the second is \\"Horse Sense: Tips and Techniques for Managers.\\" Each of the ten chapters corresponds to a core principle that Hiam believes all highly successful leaders apply. Moreover, each \\"is an important element of winning any horse race you wish your organization to enter. While they may seem like common sense, knowing when and how to apply each is a challenge.\\"<br />It would be a disservice to Hiam as well as to those who read this review for me to list the ten. Each must be carefully considered in the context within which Hiam discusses it. He begins each chapter with a boxed observation. For example:<br />\\"Make sure the horse wants to win the race too.\\" (Chapter 1)<br />\\"It is important to explore together. The best rides are often on unfamiliar trails.\\" (Chapter 5)<br />\\"Encourage your horse to believe it is a winner. It won't run its hardest until it does.\\" (Chapter 8)<br />I also appreciate the inclusion of a Checklist at the end of each chapter which highlights tips and techniques which will be most helpful during the process of applying the given principle.

I recall using it to burn holes in leaves which demonstrated the power of focus. I thought about that as I read this book. Here is one of its core concepts: \\"Negative habits breed negative consequences. Successful habits create positive rewards.\\" I agree. However, as the authors fully understand, replacing negative habits with successful habits is very difficult. A sincere and sustained commitment is imperative. However, as the authors of this volume correctly point out, something else is also needed: focus. \\"You must invest most of your time every week doing what you do best, and let others do what they do best....When you focus most of your time and energy doing the brilliant things you are truly brilliant at, you eventually reap big rewards.\\" Within organizations, this is the essence of alignment: getting the right people in the right places, doing what they do best to achieve whatever the organization's goals may be.<br />Canfield, Hansen, and Hewitt recommend and then explain ten different strategies to develop and sustain successful habits, focus on strengths, see \\"The Big Picture,\\" balance career with personal life, build excellent relationships with others, eliminate (or at least significantly reduce) fear and anxiety, ask for what you want (the authors provide a seven-point system to achieve prosperity), sustain consistent persistence, take decisive and appropriate action, and finally, how to simplify one's life without compromising one's purposes. A set of specific \\"Action Steps\\" is provided at the end of each chapter. If implemented effectively, the ten strategies can enable almost anyone to \\"hit\\" their business, personal, and financial \\"targets\\" and in many (if not most) instances \\"with absolute certainty.\\" First, however, each reader must determine what her or his \\"targets\\" are. My own experience suggests that, over time, people change their targets. Also, whatever they may be at any given time, the little rascals tend to be moving.<br />In their Final Words, the authors note that \\"there are no shortcuts to building a life of substance. It's an ongoing process. It takes time, real effort and a desire to become more than you already are. It's a worthy challenge. However, your biggest challenge starts tomorrow. How will you apply what you have learned between the covers of this book?\\" As suggested earlier, reading this this book reminded me of a large box of Crackerjacks. The material it provides reminded me of that little plastic magnifying glass. Both the box and the book offer the same \\"gift\\": an understanding and appreciation of the power of focus. I join with the authors in wishing their readers \\"an abundance of health, joy, and prosperity in the years ahead.\\"<br />If at all possible, read this book in combination with Bossidy and Charan's Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done; Hammer's The Agenda: What Every Business Must Do to Dominate the Decade; Covey's The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People; and finally, Connors, Smith, and Hickman's The Oz Principle: Getting Results Through Individual and Organizational Accountability.le change their targets.

Sloan's My Years with General Motors	Books	5	12	12	N	N	McDonald's Years of Struggle with General Motors	Until reading this book, I was wholly unaware of efforts by General Motors' lawyers to prevent the publication of Sloan's memoir My Years with General Motors which is generally considered one of the most important business books ever written. McDonald was Sloan's ghost writer (hence the dual meaning of the book's title) and provides a compelling account of how and why the book was finally published in 1963. McDonald suggests that a study in 1921 (discussed in Sloan's memoir) recommended \\"covering\\" all prospective buyers of automobiles by designing, manufacturing, and marketing a complete line for various \\"price steps.\\" In that event, GM lawyers feared, federal regulatory agencies would become involved and seek to dismantle what could be perceived as a monopoly. In 1962, McDonald initiated a lawsuit against GM. He was at that time still employed by Fortune magazine. Almost immediately, Time Inc. \\"entered the game\\", fearing loss of GM advertising. It would be a disservice to both McDonald and to those who read this review to reveal what happened next. To my surprise, the book became a \\"page turner\\" and remained so to its conclusion. McDonald tells a lively story with colorful characters, a complicated plot, all manner of crises and conflicts, subtle (and not-so-subtle) manipulations, and conflicts of interests while -- along the way -- examining a legal system exploited but which ultimately prevailed. A great read.	2002-08-06

Moreover, D'Este offers a portrait of Eisenhower somewhat different from those I had previously found in other studies of one of our nation's greatest generals. For example, until reading this book I was unaware of the nature and extent of Eisenhower's stress-induced illnesses and am now curious about their impact on his judgment. (Do they help to explain his commitment to the Market Garden initiative?) Also, D'Este indicates that Eisenhower was by no means the great strategist which I had once assumed him to be, nor especially effective as a field commander. Prior to leading the Allied invasion of North Africa in 1942, he had never been in combat. His promotion less than two years later (from colonel to four-star general) removed him entirely from field operations. He had a volcanic temper and tended to play favorites (e.g. Bradley, Hodges, and Clark). If the buck stopped on his desk, he must assume primary responsibility for failures such as the Anzio and Salerno invasions as well as for the vulnerabilities which German strategists exploited during the Battle of the Bulge.<br />His greatest strengths include being able to resolve or at least neutralize conflicts between and among prima donnas such as Patton and Montgomery; gaining the loyalty and devotion of his staff officers; being revered and trusted by the troops; and meanwhile, sustaining the support of Roosevelt, Churchill, and (most importantly) Marshall.<br />It is important to keep in mind that D'Este limits his attention almost entirely to Eisenhower's military career, devoting almost no attention to Eisenhower's private life.  Readers must seek elsewhere for a probing analysis of Eisenhower's personal relationships such as those with wife Mamie and his female driver, Kay Summersby. For me, the book's greatest value is derived from what I characterize as D'Este's \\"You Are There Strategy\\" as he enables his reader to accompany Eisenhower throughout his military career. Along the way, we learn about his childhood, his erratic years at the U.S. Military Academy, various peacetime assignments following his commission, and finally his tenure as Supreme Commander of Allied Forces during World War Two.<br />According to D'Este and countless others, Eisenhower was probably the only person (with the possible exception of Marshall who was needed elsewhere) who could have assumed and discharged the duties and responsibilities entrusted to him in that position. His 'finest hour\\" occurred when he (and he alone) had to decide whether or not to launch the invasion of Europe on June 6, 1944. Perhaps at no other time (before or since) did Eisenhower feel greater pressure. He fully accepted that burden and, as specified in writing on the eve of the invasion, he accepted full responsibility if the invasion failed. British General Alan Brooke once observed that Eisenhower \\"learned a lot during the war, but tactics, strategy, and command were never his strong suits.\\" I am unqualified to comment on that observation but D'Este seems to agree with Brooke. Be that as it may, Eisenhower's position is secure among our nation's most distinguished military leaders. Moreover, there are also quite specific reasons why so many people loved him. His is an eminence few other American heroes can claim.st value is derived from what I characterize as D'Este's \\"You Are There Strategy\\" as he enables his reader to accompany Eisenhower throughout his military career.

The original meaning of the word \\"muck\\" is \\"excrement\\"; the more general term \\"dirt\\" is a 14th century development. Given this etymological context, the contemporary meaning of the term \\"muckraker\\" is obvious. What we have here in this volume, edited by the Serrins, is a detailed and enlightening examination of \\"the journalism that changed America.\\" since the mid-eighteenth century. Certainly there has been no shortage of material to attract the interest and reward the efforts of journalists such as Robert S. Abbott, Ray Stannard Baker, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, Nellie Bly, Frederick Douglass, David Halberstam, Seymour Hersh, Arthur Jones, Edward R. Murrow, Tom Paine, Drew Pearson, Lincoln Steffens, Randy Stilts, and Ida M. Tarbell. For many readers such as I, at least a few of these names are unfamiliar as are several of the publications represented (e.g. Chicago Defender, Grand Forks Herald, Jewish Frontier, and McClure's) in which many social and political reforms were eloquently advocated.<br />The Serrins skillfully organize more than 100 works of varying length within 13 sections, each of which has a general subject (e.g. sports, poverty, war, politics). No doubt many of the journalists represented in this volume had little (if any) idea of what would eventually be uncovered when they began their \\"raking.\\" Of special interest to me are Douglass' appeal for support to abolish slavery (\\"Escape to Freedom,\\" 1834), Steinbeck's examination of migratory workers (\\"Harvest Gypsies,\\" 1936), Nader's indictment of the automobile industry (\\"Unsafe at Any Speed,\\" 1965), and Hersh's expose of atrocities committed by American troops in Viet Nam (\\"The My Lai Massacre,\\" 1969). Actually, I found all of the authors well-worth reading (or re-reading) and am grateful for the opportunity to share the thoughts and feelings of several previously unfamiliar to me.<br />The Serrins have assembled material which suggests how principled as well as passionate investigative journalism can help to achieve at least some reforms within a society which continues to be a \\"work in progress.\\" Today, journalists continue to investigate allegations concerning corporate fraud (e.g. Enron, Arkadelphia, Global Crossing, and WorldCom), pedophilia (e.g. American priests within the Roman Catholic church), insider trading (e.g. Martha Stewart), and self-serving investment counsel (e.g. Merrill Lynch). It remains to be determined to what extent (if any) any of these current investigations result in any legal or social reform. Meanwhile, it is imperative that those now under investigation, unless confirming the allegations against them, be presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Too often, in my opinion, the reverse has been true and the news media must share at least some of the blame for damage done. Investigative journalists should not be exempt from the same rigorous and relentless scrutiny to which they subject others.

Carpenter examines English cultural values during the years immediately following World War Two and focuses specifically on the 1960's when students from Oxford and Cambridge universities (with others) challenged those values with immensely entertaining satire. Theirs were significant contributions to a tradition of creative ridicule which extends back more than 2,500 years. Of course, Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Dickens are among those English authors properly renowned for their comic genius but are not usually thought of primarily as social satirists. Throughout the Age of Victoria and well into the 20th century, the British Empire flourished within a somewhat rigid social order, one which (generally) seemed to lack a sense of humor. By 1960, England had become \\"a bankrupt, defenseless little country run by a ridiculously elderly prime minister\\" (Harold Macmillan) when Jonathan Miller, Peter Cooke, Dudley Moore, and Alan Bennett introduced \\"Beyond the Fringe\\" at the Edinburgh Festival. Out of that developed Private Eye magazine, The Establishment (a men's cabaret featuring satire), and the BBC's That Was the Week That Was. Carpenter devotes substantial attention to Miller, Cooke, Moore, and Bennett as they and others detonated a \\"boom\\" of social satire whose reverberations continued through Second City, Monty Python, and Saturday Night Live. Carpenter duly notes the influence of the Goon Show (Millgan, Sellers, et al) as well as American humorists such as Mort Sahl, Mel Brooks, Lenny Bruce, and Tom Lehrer on their English counterparts. Of special interest to me is Carpenter's suggestion that, as England continued its decline among world powers in the 1960s, social satire served as a medication to deaden the pain. At one point, he reminds his reader of Cook's warning that England was then in danger of \\"sinking giggling into the sea.\\" That has not as yet happened and never will but the image remains vivid nonetheless.	2002-07-30

After having read the book, I concluded that my assumptions were essentially sound. Twitchell conducted extensive research for this book. He traveled throughout the country, roaming around various upscale retail establishments, observing salespeople and engaging in conversation with many of them. For Twitchell, what is luxury? He suggests \\"a mallet with which one pounds the taste of others\\" (does this preclude the appreciation of luxury for its own sake?) and \\"those things that you have that I think you shouldn't have\\" (does this include a terminal illness?). If I understand Twitchell (and I may well not), his research leads him to several conclusions. For example, that contemporary values are influenced significantly by advertising; that the the shoppes along Rodeo Drive and Fifth Avenue are \\"cathedrals\\" of consumption in which their customers are guided to \\"epiphanies\\" which determine purchase decisions; and that experiences with faux luxury (e.g. those found in the opulent casinos of Las Vegas) are better than none at all. When determining social status, Twitchell views what he calls \\"opuluxe spending\\"  as a more relevant criterion than is one's ancestry: You are what you can afford to own. Not all would agree with him. I don't.<br />However, few (if any) of Twitchell's readers have conducted the research he has on all this.  My own experience suggests that distinctions between Old Money and New Money are less informative than the matter of taste. (Twitchell suggests few such distinctions.) Vulgarity cuts across all economic levels but, in general, the consumption of those in the Old Money category is less conspicuous than consumption by those in the New Money category. (If Twitchell has read The Millionaire Next Door, I wonder what he thinks of Tom Stanley's conclusions.) Almost all of the affluent people I know collect and redeem coupons, are constantly alert for bargains, try to get the maximum number of shaves from a razor blade, etc. Early in life, I learned that those referred to as \\"tightwads\\" are relentlessly frugal but not opposed to \\"opuluxe spending\\" per se. Unlike most others, they maintain tight control of a \\"wad\\" which permits them to purchase just about anything they may desire.<br />What to make of this book? First of all, it's highly entertaining. Also, its general subject is one which has not as yet received as much attention as I think it deserves, although a number of other books (\\"Lux Lit\\") have also been published in recent years.  Moreover, I think that Twitchell is really on to something important when suggesting (or at least implying) that expanding consumerism on a global basis will create greater access to \\"the finer things in life.\\" Who knows? That may well raise taste levels, require higher quality and greater value from those who design and manufacture consumer products, and perhaps (just perhaps) increase both the standard of living and quality of life. Given the current War on Terrorism as well as the hostilities in the Middle East and throughout much of Africa, the sooner the participants stop shooting and start shopping, the better.in general, the consumption of those in the Old Money category is less conspicuous than consumption by those in the New Money category.

Memoirs are necessarily selective and subjective. They simply cannot cover everything as they share the thoughts and feelings as well as the perspectives and opinions of their author. to the extent that author wishes to share them (selectively). My own experience suggests that, in the \\"alley\\" of contemporary business, most of the \\"cats\\" are gray. It is therefore important to keep in mind that this is Schooley's account of what he believes happened...and did not happen...during his association with Merrill Lynch and thereafter. To his credit, he draws upon as many primary and secondary sources as possible to establish what he calls the \\"record,\\" one which \\"can speak for itself.\\"<br />What does it say? First, that an earnest, eager, and ambitious young man went to work for Merrill Lynch with the proverbial \\"high hopes\\" and \\"great expectations\\"; by the time he concluded his relationship, he had lost all respect for Merrill Lynch's organizational integrity. In this book, he explains why. Also, various circumstances and developments forced him to conduct rigorous soul-searching. Was he naive? Were his requests unreasonable? Should he have conducted himself differently?  Was it all worth it to challenge such a large and powerful organization? Schooley responds to these and other questions in his book. Finally, the book says (to me at least) that it is difficult but not impossible for an individual to initiate and then sustain such a challenge. Perilous? Of course. Doomed to failure? Not necessarily.<br />Dante reserved the last (and worst) ring in hell for those who, in a moral crisis, preserve their neutrality. According to Schooley, there were many senior-level executives within the Merrill Lynch organization who did so as did officials at various regulatory agencies. I admire Schooley's efforts to act upon his principles when he composed a memorandum for Merrill Lynch's senior managers, informing them of various improprieties and possible illegalities as well as efforts to conceal them. I admire his efforts even more after he was dismissed and then threatened with litigation unless he remained silent (i.e. preserving his neutrality). His personal as well as professional sacrifices were numerous and substantial. Nonetheless, he persevered.<br />As Schooley's reader, I have no reason to question his sincerity or integrity and am unqualified to comment on the merits of his allegations. Nor do I presume to suggest that his book will achieve all of the objectives he had in mind when he wrote it. (Organizations as large and complicated as Merrill Lynch remind me of the fact that \\"jumbo\\" oil tankers must travel approximately 30 miles to reverse their direction.) I rate this book so highly because I think it raises a number of questions which must be addressed by senior-level corporate executives, especially now as other allegations are made by other Schooleys in their respective organizations. Schooley obviously believes that our society needs more \\"white cats\\" and fewer \\"black \\"cats,\\" not only in the private sector but in publicly-funded regulatory agencies which have fiduciary responsibility to all citizens.

Each year, thousands of eager and ambitious young women and men arrive on Wall Street. What we have here is Maier's account of what happened to him after he relocated from Cambridge (MA) in 1994 and went to work for Cramer &amp; Company, a hedge fund. He made a total commitment to advancing his career and eventually was entrusted with managing an investment fund of approximately $50-million. His is an insider's unique and compelling interpretation and evaluation, not only of his own experiences but also of Jim Cramer and the firm he founded and headed. As I began to read this book, I realized that its title lends itself to all manner of interpretation. For example, who is the \\"enemy\\"? Those with whom one competes for career advancement, obviously, but also those psychological forces which require trade-offs when ethics are in conflict with expediency. (Pogo once suggested that \\"we have met the enemy and he is us.\\") Maier and Cramer worked closely together and then, for various reasons which Maier explain in this book, he left the firm after five years. By then he and Cramer had become enemies and are now involved in litigation.<br />It is important to keep in mind that personal accounts such this are necessarily selective and subjective. (The same is true of Cramer's Confessions of a Street Addict.) There are specific reasons why this book's subtitle is \\"Seduction and Betrayal on Jim Cramer's Wall Street.\\" Maier acknowledges that he was seduced by the opportunities he pursued while employed by Cramer &amp; Company. Eventually, he felt betrayed by Cramer and explains why. That relationship reminds of the character Bud Fox played by Charlie Sheen in the film Wall Street. He is dazzled by the business success and lifestyle of Gordon Gecko, the character played by Michael Douglas. Much of what motivated Fox also motivated Meier. Moreover,when the film concludes as Fox and Gecko are headed for federal prison, Fox's opinion of Gecko is strikingly similar to Meier's opinion of Cramer when their five-year association ends in 1995.<br />It remains for each reader to decide to what extent Meier is responsible for what happened to him, and, to what extent Cramer should be blamed.

In ways and to an extent their authors probably could not have anticipated while writing them, the two books cover much of the same ground but disagree primarily on the nature and extent of Cramer's legal liability. (I am unqualified to comment on certain allegations and technicalities which will probably be resolved in a court of law.) Personal accounts, especially of highly volatile circumstances in which Cramer often found himself, are necessarily selective and subjective. It is important to keep in mind that this is his account. He duly acknowledges his imperfections which result in both verbal and physical violence. On occasion, he abused his associates with profanities; other times, he destroyed telephones, furniture, and computer terminals. As Cramer explains, there was a \\"game\\" to be played and apparently he played it very well. (In his own book, Maier acknowledges those skills while accusing Cramer of improprieties and even illegalities for which, he insists,  Cramer should be held accountable.) For me, the greatest value of this book is derived from his detailed account of HOW he did business: networking to obtain information and then analyzing it; making \\"buy/hold/sell\\" decisions while under tremendous pressure (e.g. from deadlines as well as from the potential consequences of those decisions); and meanwhile, struggling (with mixed results) to balance the demands of his career with his family obligations. Those who read this book will soon become aware of Cramer's various \\"addictions.\\" (He is remarkably frank when discussing them.) It will be interesting to learn what lies ahead for him as well as for the investment community in which he was once such an active and controversial competitor.	2002-07-12

He organizes his material within three Parts: The Rise to Global Economic Power, The Heart of the American Century, and Our Own Times. So what we have here, in a single volume, are eight mini-biographies, critical analysis of the \\"giants,\\" and an equally valuable analysis of the evolution of American business history during the last 150 years. Although not always in agreement with Tedlow, I especially appreciate sharing his own opinions. He cites a wealth of primary sources and on occasion expresses his own disagreements with others such as Joseph Frazier Wall, author of arguably the definitive biography of Andrew Carnegie. Tedlow has consummate writing skills. His narrative has Snap! Crackle! and Pop! Throughout the book, he offers hundreds of revealing anecdotes, direct quotations, relevant examples to illustrate and support key points, and -- much appreciated -- a playful sense of humor. Tedlow really is an entertaining raconteur as well as a distinguished business scholar.<br />This is one of the most entertaining as well as most informative business books I have read in recent years. Those who share my high regard for it are urged to check out Crainer's The Management Century, Thought Leaders edited by Kurtzman, Wren and Greenwood's Management Innovators, Leibovich's The New Imperialists, and Landrum's Profiles of Genius.	2002-07-11

However greatly their two subjects differ, both are written with the narrative skills of a novelist, the discipline of a consummate historian, and an objectivity which enables the reader to absorb and digest the abundance of information without manipulation by the biographer. Whereas McCullough examines Adams' entire life (1735-1826), Morris limits his attention almost entirely to a period extending from 1901 when Roosevelt became President after McKinley was assassinated until 1908 when Roosevelt vacated that office rather than seek another term. Morris includes comments about Roosevelt's youthful exuberance by those with whom he had direct and frequent contact. For example, British diplomat Cecil Spring Rice: \\"You must always remember that the president is about 8\\" and Elihu Root on the occasion of Roosevelt's 46th birthday: \\"You have made a very good start in life and your friends have great hope for you when you grow up.\\"<br />Throughout the narrative, Morris cites countless examples of Roosevelt's physical courage. Through sheer force of will and a rigorous regimen of exercise, the once frail and sickly youth became a fearless adult of almost limitless energy. Morris also explains Roosevelt's active role in initiatives to finance and then construct the Panama Canal. (Those with a special interest in this subject are urged to read Ovidio Diaz Espino's How Wall Street Created a Nation: J.P. Morgan, Teddy Roosevelt, and the Panama Canal.) Roosevelt seemed to \\"larger-than-life\\" to most of his contemporaries, a perception easily understood, given his passions and appetites for physical exercise, reading, correspondence, food, competition,  and -- above all else -- the United States of America. Morris skillfully juxtaposes Roosevelt's aristocratic background (i.e. family wealth, Groton, and Harvard) with his \\"populist\\" positions re trust busting, preservation of national resources, and improving the conditions of the working class.

(\\"My interview questions are omitted so that readers can focus on the author's words.\\") It is important to keep in mind that these are, literally, \\"stories from American history\\" rather than traditional academic briefs. That is to say, they are not dull and dry. On the contrary, their format, tone, and style are casual but at no time careless. Credit Lamb and his associates for a first-rate job of editing the material. Those interviewed are erudite raconteurs. Lamb organizes the essays within nine parts: Revolution and Founding (1776-1815), The Young Nation (1815-1850), Slavery and the Civil War (1850-1865), Rebuilding America and the Guided Age ((1865-1901), Progressive Era and Reaction (1901-1929), Depression and War (1929-1945), Early Cold War (1945-1957), Social Transformation (1957-1975), and The Culture Wars (1975-2000). I am especially grateful to Lamb for his headnotes for each chapter. Here is how he introduces Joyce Appleby and her comments on \\"The First Generation of Americans\\":<br />\\"The census of 1800 reported 1.1 million people living in the United States -- more than twice the number in the colonies at the beginning of the American Revolution. There were four cities with a population greater than 10,000 -- Baltimore, Boston, Philadelphia, and New York. Half of the population was under sixteen years of age. On June 18, 2000, Joyce Appleby, a U.C.L.A. professor and author of Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans, published in 2000 by Belnap Press, appeared on Booknotes to tell us about this era and how this `first generation' helped shape the young nation.\\"<br />Headnotes such as these serve as appropriate introductions, of course, but also suggest additional sources which readers may wish to explore. It is also helpful to have the \\"Complete List of C-SPAN Booknotes (1989-2001),\\" then totaling 619. This is one of three books published thus far, based on 79 of those interviews.

Whereas  Morris limits his attention to a period which extending from 1901 when Roosevelt became President after McKinley was assassinated until 1908 when Roosevelt vacated that office rather than seek another term, McCullough examines Adams' entire life (1735-1826). I was especially interested in McCullough's portrayal of Abigail Adams' many admirable, in some instances heroic qualities, notably her courage and determination when separated for extended periods of time from her beloved husband. McCullough also offers a vivid, sometimes poignant portrayal of the great personal sacrifices which John Adams also made during the years preceding and following the Declaration of Independence.<br />McCullough carefully Adams' relationships with Washington (with whom he served as Vice President for eight years) and, of course, with Jefferson whom McCullough reveals to be -- at times -- a selfish and self-serving (when expedient, hypocritical) person who was unwilling and/or unable to make the same personal sacrifices in service of the new nation which others did. Adams made certain that the government in which he served sustained a delicate but essential balance between and among \\"an independent executive authority, an independent senate, and an independent judiciary power, as well as an independent house of representatives.\\" Adams lived until the age of 90, the longest life of any President. Eventually, he and Jefferson re-established their friendship. Both Jefferson died on the same day: July 4, 1826...the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.<br />This is indeed an epic biography as well as a probing and comprehensive examination of the society in which Adams lived. McCullough enables his reader to accompany Adams throughout what was, arguably, the most stressful and productive period of American history. Drawing upon a wealth of research resources, including correspondence and especially the letters which Abigail and John Adams exchanged, he is also able to reveal the defining qualities of Adams' character which were not always evident in his interaction with others. Even those who found his company on occasion intolerable also noted and admired his impeccable integrity.

In it, Bainbridge demonstrates the skills of a novelist, historian, and (yes) cultural anthropologist. She enables her reader to return in time to the life and society of Samuel Johnson and do so within a fictional context, although he and most of the others featured really did exist and knew each other. (Johnson and Henry Thrale were close friends for more than 20 years.) The narrative (as such) is provided from several different perspectives. Values and opinions play a much greater role than do specific actions. The trip to the continent changes the setting but not the ongoing interactions (misunderstandings, tensions, breakdowns in communication, etc.) which complicate while intensifying Johnson's relations with the Thrales. With rare skill, Bainbridge enables her reader to (metaphorically speaking, of course) get into the heads and hearts of Johnson and various Thrales, notably Hester Thrale and eldest daughter \\"Queeney.\\"<br />I doubt if more than a few people who read According to Queeney have already read (or will ever read) James Boswell's The Life of Samuel Johnson, among the greatest biographies ever written. (Perhaps few who read this review of mine know anything about either Boswell or Johnson.) Some have suggested that Bainbridge portrays the \\"darker\\" sides of Johnson's personality. I agree while presuming to assert that the aforementioned \\"interactions\\" between and among Johnson and the Thrales, rather than Johnson himself, serve as the primary focus.<br />Who will most enjoy reading this book? Those such as I who enjoy the films of Ismail Merchant and James Ivory and (perhaps) Robert Altman's Gosford Park as well as those who view certain novels (e.g. those of Balzac, Dickens, Twain, and Tolstoy) as a \\"magic carpet\\" which also facilitates a journey back in time to a distant, unfamiliar, and colorful period in human history.	2002-06-30

At any moment, they can be called upon to save both lives and property. Many have perished while doing so. What is it like to live in a firehouse? What is involved in the selection and training of those who do? What are their thoughts and feelings about the sometimes life-threatening dangers they face together? Do they resent the fact that, except in an emergency when their courage as well as their skills are required, they tend to be taken for granted? How do the general public's attitudes toward them differ from attitudes toward police officers?<br /><br />Halberstam attempts to answer these and other questions as he focuses his attention on Engine 40, Ladder 35 which is located only a few blocks from his home in Manhattan. He was asked to write an article for a magazine. This book is an expanded account of what he experienced and learned while completing his work on that article. He was surprised and pleased to be accepted by the firemen. For me, everything I learned while reading this book was within the context of the fact that thirteen firemen from Engine 40, Ladder 35 responded to the attack on the World Trade Center and only one did not perish. Obviously Halberstam greatly admires such men; also, he feels a profound gratitude for their efforts and a great respect for their deportment. (Firemen do not have to brag about their competence and courage. They KNOW.) I was surprised that most of them are so young. (I had the same reaction when reading about the officers and other crew members who flew in B-17s and B-24s during World War Two.) Presumably fitness usually found only in youth is required of those who must sometimes haul 80-100 pounds of equipment up and down the stairwells of Manhattan's tall buildings. Given the general subject of this book, I was also surprised by the nature and extent of humor which Halberstam shares. Much of the narrative is tragic, almost heart-breaking, but there is also much joy.<br /><br />These men love each other and thrive on what they do together. For that reason, their work is not just a \\"job\\" and their firehouse is not just a building.

Emily Gwathmey co-authored this one. (The other is Pump and Circumstance.) Regrettably, copies of both are now difficult to obtain but well-worth the effort. Each focuses on what may seem to be a highly specialized subject. In fact, both offer a wealth of information and commentary concerning a basic component within the development of U.S. culture during the 20th century. This volume focuses on the \\"American movie theaters and how we had fun.\\"  Obviously, I have no idea how many readers of this review settled into a seat in one or more of the theaters which are featured in this volume. Many of them are no longer exist or have been converted to serve other purposes.<br />The excellent material is carefully organized within an especially appropriate format: a Prologue (written by Harold Ramis), followed by \\"Now Playing\\" (a brief history of film theaters) and then eight \\"Scenes\\" which focus on specific developments such as Saturday matinees and drive-ins. The illustrations (especially archival photographs, most in full-color) are superb. I was surprised to learn that several of the most  ornate theaters were located in small towns throughout the United States. Margolies and Gwathmey provide a wealth of historical information about the theaters themselves, of course, but also about the entertainment entrepreneurs (many of whom combined films with arcades and even vaudeville programs), and the architects they retained to design theaters for them. In most small towns, the film theater was the major (if not only) cultural center. More often than not, an usher in uniform (perhaps wearing white gloves) guided people to their seats. Once the film began, the same usher used a flashlight to assist late-arrivals.<br />In the final chapter (Scene Eight: Elegy), observe: \\"the beautiful and ornate movie theaters we went to when we were growing up live on in our minds. Many of them survive as treasured landmarks, painstakingly restored to their former opulent splendor. Nearly all have suffered sadder fates. An unfortunate few cling to life as porno houses.

In fact, both offer a wealth of information and commentary concerning a basic component within the development of U.S. culture. This volume focuses on the \\"glory days of the gas station.\\" At least some readers of this review recall traveling across the country decades ago and pulling over where they could fill up their vehicle's gas tank. For many summers, I drove from Chicago to Los Angeles along Route 66 and stopped at several of the locations featured in this book. I have forgotten when but, at some point, the filling station became a service station. Upon arrival, an eager stranger appeared to fill up the tank, check the oil and tire pressure, wash the windows, and encourage me to purchase a canvas bag filled with water in the event the summer heat depleted the water in the radiator. One attendant who resembled Gabby Hayes noted that I might also need extra water \\"if this thing of yours breaks down in the middle of nowhere.\\"<br />Margolies organizes his material within five chapters: Pump and Circumstance (signage); Pioneer Days (road maps); Golden Age: 1920-1940 (Pop Architecture, Aircraft, Razzmatazz: Kid Stuff, Believe it or Not!, Razzmatazz: That's Entertainment!, and Deco Moderne); \\"Going, Going...: 1940-1965 (Razzmatazz: Postwar Frolics, Porcelain Enamel, restrooms, and Razzmatazz: The Best of the Best; and Back to the Future: 1965-1990.

Chapter 3 was especially interesting to me because it examines (with some of the best graphics in the book) various gas station architectures which include the Gulf Lighthouse Service Station (Miami Beach, FL), windmill-shaped buildings (Saint Cloud, MN), shell-shaped Shell gas stations (Winston-Salem, NC), the B-17 \\"Bomber Gas Station\\" (the plane installed above the pumps in Milwaukee, WI), \\"Bob's Airmail Service Station\\" built around a 32-passenger Fokker plane (Los Angeles, CA), and a zepplin-shaped building grounded beside the Pennzoil pumps (near Pittsburgh, PA).

Why another book? In his Introduction, Wilson acknowledges that much attention has been devoted to Henry's six wives (Three Catherines, two Annes, and a Jane) and shares this mnemonic:<br />\\"Divorced, beheaded, died,<br />Divorced, beheaded, survived.\\"<br />and then observes: \\"I propose a different set of relationships which I believe offers a more illuminating approach to the court and government of Henry VIII. Specifically, Wilson focuses his primary attention on six Thomases: Wolsey, More, Cromwell, Howard, Wriothesley, and Cramner. \\"I can even suggest an alternative mortuary mnemonic, although one admittedly not so trippingly off the tongue.<br />Died, beheaded, beheaded,<br />Self-slaughtered, burned, survived.\\"<br />Henry's VIII's relationships with all six serve as the basis of Wilson's narrative. There were lions in London at that time (\\"the King's Beasts\\") housed in the Tower menagerie and a major tourist attraction. More once compared the king's court to a lion pit \\"in which the magnificent and deadly king of beasts held sway.\\"<br />Of the six, More interests me the most. One of my favorite plays and films is A Man for All Seasons. (In the film,  More is brilliantly portrayed by Paul Scofield.) In both, Robert Bolt focuses on More's rectitude which threatens and infuriates Henry and eventually results in More's execution. Thus presented, More is a tragic but noble political victim and religious martyr, later canonized by the Roman Catholic Church. He is no less admirable as portrayed by Wilson but, in my opinion, is much more complicated than Bolt and others suggest. For years, More skillfully navigated his way through a court (\\"a lion pit\\") characterized by what Wilson refers to as its \\"seamy realities\\": \\"The royal entourage was a vicious, squirming world of competing ambitions and petty feuds, guilty secrets and salacious prudery,.

Here are the first five:  Tom Paine's \\"Common Sense\\" which helped to establish and then nourish a patriotic fervor without which the War for Independence probably could not have been won.; Charles Kettering's invention of the automobile self-starter which eliminated the need for a hand crank which had broken many arms; barbed wire (\\"the devil's hatband\\") which protected property as well as livestock and thus helped to tame the frontier; Alexander Joy Cartwright's design of the baseball diamond (in 1846) for a variation of the English game of \\"rounders,\\"  a design which established the same infield configuration wherever the game is played;  and Harry S Truman's commitment to the Berlin Airlift during the Cold War (\\"We stay in Berlin, period.\\"). Other subjects include the Coca-Cola formula, Coney Island, the Duke Ellington orchestra, the G.I. Bill of Rights, N.C. Wyeth's  illustrations for Stevenson's Treasure Island, the New Yorker magazine, the Pony Express, tabasco sauce, the Underground Railway, and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. All of the illustrations are superb. Several of the brief commentaries were written by various contributors such as Allen Barra (Black Baseball), David McCullough (The Brooklyn Bridge), Kevin Baker (FDR's Fireside Chats), and David Douglas Duncan (LIFE Magazine). This volume's size and appearance may suggest that it is just another \\"coffee table book.\\" In fact, what editors Wilson, Marcus, and various contributors share attracts and rewards the attention of those, especially young people, who have little (if any) understanding of why each of the 81 subjects is so important to the society in which they now live. Ours continues to be an abundant and diverse culture.  Hopefully it will continue to produce other American \\"greats\\" to join those which Wilson, Marcus, and their distinguished associates so brilliantly celebrate.ther American \\"greats\\" to join those which Wilson, Marcus, and their distinguished associates so brilliantly celebrate.	2002-06-27

Carter has obviously given a great deal of careful thought to the important issues he addresses. For example, he is deeply concerned about what he views as a deterioration of spirituality in American society. Ours is perhaps the most democratic of all capitalistic cultures, ensuring strict separation of church and state as well as the right to embrace any religion (or none). Carter fully supports that separation and indicates zero-tolerance of threats to that right. However, he repudiates efforts by those among the national media with a strong liberal bias who trivialize basic values which are, in fact, common to all of the world's major religions. He asserts that these values should guide and inform national policy (not the other way around), just as they once did when thirteen colonies declared war on  the most powerful nation in the world and then reaffirmed the same values 12 years later in the new nation's Constitution and Bill of Rights.<br />In Christianity on Trial, Vincent Carroll and David Shiflett provide both a broad overview and a close analysis of various accusations against the Christian church over the centuries. Many of these accusations were valid; others were not. However, undeniably, the Hellenic-Hebraic values of Christianity are inextricably bound up in the fabric of American legal as well as political and social history. It's hard for me to believe but it has been more 40 years since Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his associates began their efforts to achieve full and unqualified human rights for all Americans. Carter is hardly alone when asking \\"What has been accomplished since then? What remains to be done?\\" Not all readers will agree with the answers he has formulated, at least thus far, but I think everyone who reads this book will be much better prepared to consider basic issues which transcend legality in pursuit of justice, which transcend consensus in pursuit of fundamental human decency.in pursuit of fundamental human decency.	2002-06-12

First, Batten (with Jeffrey L. Cruikshank) provides a compelling analysis of the challenges and problems he and his associates had to overcome to achieve the improbable business success of \\"a media phenomenon.\\" Also, after having read this book, I had a much better understanding and appreciation of the value of what the Weather Channel now offers in this so-called \\"Age of Information.\\" What if advanced warnings about severely inclement weather had been easily accessible in years past? How many lives would have been spared from natural disasters such as the hurricane which devastated Galveston Island in 1900?<br /><br />For many people I personally know (including my wife), the Weather Channel is \\"must viewing\\" at the beginning and end of of each day. For them and countless others, it is the modern day equivalent of a crystal ball. For business travelers, which clothing to pack? For parents, what should the children wear to school? For those about to be involved in an outdoor activity (e.g. a Little League game, family picnic, or round of golf), \\"what's it going to be like?\\" Of course, born and raised in Chicago, I know how unpredictable the weather can often be. Years later, while living in Boston, I recall an elderly woman who called the meteorologist at a local television station to complain that \\"I now have four inches of `partly cloudy' in my basement!\\" In this book, Batten brilliantly achieves two major objectives: To tell a unique \\"business success story,\\" and in process, thereby to explain why the Weather Channel has become so important to so many people.	2002-06-11

Especially today, everyone involved in a given organization must embrace change, build respect and trust, create and then sustain a \\"winning atmosphere,\\" prepare for tomorrow, and maximize everyone's potential. In my review of Serven's The End of Office Politics as Usual, I observed that it is no coincidence that the companies which are most highly admired, which generate the greatest number of applicants from among those who work for their competitors, are also the most profitable. One of several reasons is that companies which are both admirable and prosperous have zero-tolerance of what is generally referred to as \\"office politics.\\" Presumably Lloyd agrees that employees not only need but deserve a supervisor (I personally dislike the term \\"boss\\") who simply will not tolerate inappropriate behavior by anyone. Period.<br />The information and suggestions which Lloyd provides in this book are obviously based on an abundance of real-world experience. He carefully organizes his excellent material within five Sections:<br />Building the Foundation<br />Key Concepts and Practices<br />Everyday Roles and Responsibilities<br />It's the People<br />Passing the Tests<br />Much of my time is involved with the accelerated development of what are sometimes referred to as \\"fast track\\" executives. (I refer to them as \\"tigers\\" and \\"tigresses.\\") Also, I continue to be retained to work with CEOs and their management teams. I presume to include this personal information to make a point: Even decision-makers at the highest organizational levels need frequent reminders of management principles which they may perhaps view as \\"basic,\\" \\"obvious,\\" or \\"simplistic.\\" They need to re-read Lloyd's book at least every 90 days. (NOTE: In the final chapter, Lloyd provides a lengthy series of \\"Self-Assessment Questions.\\" In the strongest terms possible, I urge supervisors at all organizational levels to answer each of these questions with total frankness and then review their answers on a regular basis.) My own experience supports all of Lloyd's key points. What he does not state but implies throughout his book is that the most effective male supervisors are gentlemen; the most effective female supervisors are ladies. For whatever reasons, civility is among the most important yet least discussed qualities of great leadership.<br />Think about it.

As a single-volume source of information and analysis, I rate this just behind Sir Gilbert's biography but it is a superb achievement nonetheless. At least to some extent, this is a memoir of Jenkins' own experiences during \\"The Churchill Years\\" during which he (Jenkins) was centrally involved in the British government.<br />The material is carefully organized within six Parts: A Brash Young Man (1874-1908); The Glow Worm Glows: The Morning Was Golden (1908-1914); The Noontide Was Bronze (1914-1918); Hesitant Afternoon Sunshine (1919-1939); The Saviour of the Country and the Light of the World? (1039-1945); and Was the Evening Leaden? (1945-1965)<br />The metaphor of a 24-hour cycle works generally well, correctly suggesting significant and revealing correlations between British (indeed global) history and Churchill's own life and career during the same 91-year period. Obviously, Jenkins greatly admires Churchill but does not hesitate to acknowledge his subject's human imperfections, notably his vanity, self-indulgent extravagances (e.g. cigars and champagne) and his sometimes volcanic irascibility.<br />For me, two of Churchill's most interesting relationships analyzed skillfully by Jenkins are those with wife Clementine and with Franklin Delano Roosevelt. She adored him even as she never hesitated to suggest (with exquisite tact) his need to improve his \\"people skills.\\" How much I would enjoy being the proverbial fly on the wall if she and Lady Bird Johnson were able to discuss their husbands over a cup of tea. With regard to FDR, there were limits on what he could do for both Churchill and Great Britain prior to World War Two but, as Jenkins suggests, FDR was throughout the relationship a true friend and ally, but always the politician (if not always the statesman) until his health began to deteriorate. It is inconceivable to me that a world figure such as Churchill would take up residence in the White House for several months, especially at the time when he did.<br />This single-volume biography makes its own important contributions to our understanding of one of the most important persons throughout the 20th century. However, if you intend to read only one biography of Churchill, my recommendation would still be Sir Martin Gilbert's. I also highly recommend James C. Hume's The Wit and Wisdom of Winston Churchill: A Treasury of More than 1,000 Quotations and Anecdotes.figure such as Churchill would take up residence in the White House for several months, especially at the time when he did.<br />This single-volume biography makes its own important contributions to our understanding of one of the most important persons throughout the 20th century.

The claim on this book's dust jacket that Chowdhury offers \\"the only [in italics for emphasis] way to achieve Six Sigma\\" is obviously ludicrous. Presumably he would be the first to agree with Michael Hammer who wrote The Agenda to repudiate the idea that there is one and only one \\"silver bullet\\" to hit the \\"target\\" of organizational transformation. In fact, there is a full arsenal of weapons. \\"Six Sigma's trademark methodology of DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) has become a standard operating procedure in companies around the globe.\\" Quite true. The challenge is to select what is most appropriate to the specific needs and objectives of a given organization. One of Chowdhury's  many and substantial gifts is his ability to explain even the most difficult of concepts to those who lack his understanding of highly sophisticated production and measurement systems. This talent was demonstrated in his previously published The Power of Six Sigma which I view as an invaluable \\"primer\\" for non-engineers such as those in marketing and sales.<br />In this volume, he carefully organizes his material within seven chapters. Everything Chowdhury shares, directly or indirectly, explains how to use Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) to `start from scratch to design the product or process to be virtually error free.\\" Chowdhury is absolutely convinced that what sets DFSS apart from other variations of Six Sigma methodology is getting it right the first time. If I understand what seems to be one of Chowdhury's key points (and I may not) it is absolutely essential during the process of designing any new product or service to anticipate literally everything that could go wrong with it, then complete the design so as to prevent those defects. For m,e, this is the single greatest value of the DFSS methodology. So viewed, constant verification during each step of the design process is absolutely essential.<br />Throughout his book, Chowdhury explains why DFSS is (he's obviously convinced) \\"the ONLY way to achieve Six Sigma,\\" how to formulate an effective DFSS strategy, what various roles are for everyone involved, how to identify and define appropriate opportunities, how to develop concepts during Phase II of the process, how to optimize the design, and then how to verify and then re-verify it. He concludes by asserting that \\"the real power of Design for Six Sigma is realized as you mature the integration of DFSS into your new product and service introduction process\\" and promises that those companies \\"that effectively accomplish this level of maturation in DFSS will command almost insurmountable competitive advantages. The tsunami of DFSS is coming. Ride the leading edge to win the new global competitive race that has already begun.\\"<br />Those who share my high regard for Chowdhury's book are urged to check out the previously mentioned book by Michael Hammer (The Agenda) as well as Bossidy and Charan's Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done, Pande et al's The Six Sigma Way: How GE, Motorola, and Other Top Companies Are Honing Their Performance, Eckes's Making Six Sigma Last: Managing the Balance Between Cultural and Technical Change, George's Lean Six Sigma: Combing Six Sigma Quality with Lean Production Speed, and Kaplan and Norton's The Strategy-Focused Organization: How Balanced Scorecard Companies Thrive in the New Business Environment.sly convinced) \\"the ONLY way to achieve Six Sigma,\\" how to formulate an effective DFSS strategy, what various roles are for everyone involved, how to identify and define appropriate opportunities, how to develop concepts during Phase II of the process, how to optimize the design, and then how to verify and then re-verify it.

O'Neil, Lee wrote this book primarily for persons such as I whose understanding of murder trials depended almost entirely, at least until the O.J. Simpson trial, on plays, films and television programs. Lee played a key role in the Simpson trial which is among the five he examines in this book. The other four (all resulting in a verdict of guilt beyond reasonable doubt) involved homicide charges against Kenneth Mathison, Richard Bunel Crafts, Edward Robert Sherman, and Theodore (\\"Ted\\") MacArthur. Although all of these other four cases were no doubt widely covered by national media, I was unfamiliar with them until reading Lee's book. Throughout, he generously acknowledges the importance of teamwork and praises all of his associates. Lee defines the term forensics as \\"the direct application of scientific knowledge and techniques to matters of law.\\" He notes that \\"the wise forensic investigator will always remember that he must bring all of his life experiences and logic to find the truth. This means common sense, informed intuition, and the courage to see things as they are. Then he must speak honestly about all that it adds up to.\\" The process is necessarily complicated and demanding, requiring as much patience as it does precision.<br />It would be a disservice to both Lee and his reader to share more than a few details in this review. \\"Each of the five cases presents the opportunity, through its respective facts, investigation, and legal resolution, to study particular aspects of forensic investigation and how the work fits in with the rest of the criminal justice system.\\" What Lee accomplishes in this book is to help his reader to develop (or at least understand) some of the skills he (Lee) has used while accompanying him during the investigation of five different murders. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Evans' The Casebook of Forensic Science: How Science Solved 100 of the World's Most Baffling Cases;  Criminal Investigation co-authored by Swanson, Chamelin, and Territo; and Punitive Damages co-authored by Sunstein, Hastie, Payne, and Schkade.riminal Investigation co-authored by Swanson, Chamelin, and Territo; and Punitive Damages co-authored by Sunstein, Hastie, Payne, and Schkade.	2002-06-04

One of several reasons is that companies which are both admirable and prosperous have zero-tolerance of what is generally referred to as \\"office politics.\\" Of course, all human organizations are inherently political in certain respects. President Truman once observed that politics is \\"the art of getting things done.\\" As Caro clearly demonstrates in the third volume of his biography of Lyndon Baines Johnson, LBJ was a consummate \\"artist\\" of politics while serving as senate majority leader. What Serven examines in this book is what could be described as the \\"politics of self-interest\\": self-serving behavior which is not in the best interests of the given organization or the welfare of others involved in it. As Serven carefully explains, these \\"politics of &quot;self-interest\\" diminish morale and productivity, preclude teamwork worthy of the name, and ultimately incur a substantial cost, only some of which is revealed at the bottom line. (What is the cost of losing peak performers who have lost all respect for an organization which tolerates office politics?) Even before he begins his narrative, Serven cites these three quotations:<br />\\"The trouble with the rat race is that even if you win, you're still a rat.\\" (Lily Tomlin)<br />\\"The truth, dear Brutus, is not in the stars,/But in ourselves.\\" (William Shakespeare)<br />\\"We have met the enemy, and he is us.\\" (Walt Kelly's Pogo)<br />Serven's point is obvious: Organizations can become weakened and even destroyed by office politics which, in essence, involve internal -- rather than external -- competition. He brilliantly keeps a promise implicit in his book's subtitle: \\"A Complete Strategy for Creating a More Productive and Profitable Organization.\\" He identifies almost all of the \\"usual suspects\\" and then offers practical advice as to how to overcome major barriers to communication and cooperation.<br />My own opinion is that those who are involved or associated with organizations which tolerate (thereby condone) office politics should do everything humanly possible to extricate themselves. However, in the so-called \\"real\\" world, it may be necessary (for whatever reasons) to remain involved or associated. In that event, Serven's book can help them to make the most and (hopefully) best of a bad situation. It is also my opinion that office politics can sometimes be effective but only on a short-term basis; over time, those who play them invariably find themselves the victim of their own unprofessional behavior. The most effective female executives I know are also ladies; the most effective male executives I know are gentlemen. All of them understand politics. More to the point, they also appreciate the importance of proper behavior between and among those with whom they are associated. In wholly practical terms, \\"office politics\\" reduce both production and profits. Indeed, as Serven explains so well, the total cost is probably incalculable...and should be (but often isn't) intolerable.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Vincent M.

Hoge and Rose have assembled and edited 23 essays written by a commendably diverse number of authorities on separate but related subjects which include an \\"anatomy of the terrorist attack\\" (Brian M. Jenkins). \\"Islam through history\\" (Karen Armstrong), \\"prevention, deterrence, defense\\" (William J. Perry), \\"the economic repercussions\\" (Martin N. Bailey), and \\"what September 11th hath wrought\\" (Fareed Zakaria). Obviously, all of us (including these and other authorities) are still sorting through and correlating new information as it becomes available. Definitive \\"answers\\" to the questions we now ask may not be determined for years and perhaps not for decades. Obviously, the events which occurred on September 11th did not occur in a vacuum. Moreover, the implications and consequences of those events continue to reveal themselves. For me, this anthology's greatest value lies in the frame of reference which the essayists create. Hoge and Rose conclude their Introduction as follows: \\"As we mourn the dead, we must also absorb the lessons, some of which are grim. Additional terrorist attacks on America are likely. Chemical and biological weapons may be used. September 11, an outrage and a tragedy for us, is an inspiration for terrorists. Only preparedness, determination, and ultimately, self-confidence can offset the forebodings. The moral that Winston Churchill chose for his towering history of the previous global conflict is as apt now as it was then:<br /> In War: Resolution<br /> In Defeat: Defiance<br /> In Victory: Magnanimity<br /> In Peace: Goodwill<br />Those who carefully read this book will also be better prepared to understand what has yet to occur, not only in the United States but throughout the world.	2002-06-03

In it, Bossidy and Charan (with Charles Burck) focus on what effective execution involves. Having read or observed interviews of Bossidy, I realized while reading this book that his is the primary role in the collaboration. Mercifully, the reader is spared vague theories as well as buzzing words and overheated phrases. Anchored in a wealth of real-world business experience, the book's core insights could be of substantial value to literally anyone who currently has problems \\"getting things done\\", doing them well, and on-time.<br />In the first chapter, the authors identify what they call \\"the gap nobody knows.\\" That is somewhat hyperbolic. Obviously Bossidy and Charan are aware of it as are, presumably, countless other decision-makers in various companies which sustain profitability while attracting and then retaining \\"the best and the brightest\\" people, often from competitor companies. In any event, the authors correctly stress the importance of eliminating the gap between recognizing what must be done and getting it done. The authors focus on three former CEOs of major corporations, each of whom they hold in high regard: Richard A. McGinn (Lucent Technologies) G. Richard Thoman (Xerox), and C. Michael Armstrong (AT&amp;T). However, McGinn was \\"clearly out of touch\\" with day-to-day operations during his last year as CEO. For whatever reasons, Thoman lacked two essential \\"building blocks\\": the right people in key positions on his management team, and, appropriate core processes by which to implement his strategy, one which the authors view as being sound. As for Armstrong, the ambitious growth strategy he pursued was \\"disconnected from both external and internal realities\\" such as the regulatory climate at that time and the AT&amp;T culture which was resistant to the major changes which Armstrong's strategy required.  These three examples illustrate that even those with exceptional intelligence, energy, and character can fail to achieve their worthy objectives. The authors acknowledge that  \\"Shaping the broad picture into a set of executable actions is analytical, and it's a huge intellectual, and emotional challenge.\\" Some organizations and their leaders succeed. This book explains how. Most organizations and their leaders do not. This book explains why.<br />Some readers of this review may incorrectly infer from my comments thus far that this book was written primarily for and about senior-level corporate executives. For that reason, I reiterate that all of the observations, evaluations, and suggestions provided in this book are directly relevant to almost anyone in any organization (regardless of size or nature) who is expected to \\"get things done,\\" whatever those \\"things\\" may be. I agree completely with Noel Tichy (author of The Leadership Engine) that every organization needs aggressive and productive initiative at all levels.<br />Including the word \\"discipline\\" in this book's title was intentional and is appropriate. Obviously, those who are decisive are not always successful. (What I call the \\"Fire! Ready! Aim! Syndrome\\" is far too common, especially among less-experienced but eager and ambitious executives.) The most effective decision-making process is one based on sufficient and relevant information which has been rigorously analyzed. (Thus evaluated, information becomes intelligence.) Relevant and (especially) painful realities are taken into full account. All appropriate options are identified and prioritized. When a major crisis occurs which requires an immediate response, the decision-maker(s) involved must also have courage. Discipline is essential throughout this entire process, a discipline which includes what Daniel Goleman characterizes as \\"emotional intelligence\\" or what Ernest Hemingway characterizes as \\"grace under duress.\\"<br />As indicated previously, I think this book will be of great value to any decision-maker  (regardless of title or status) in any organization (regardless of size or nature) because the authors focus relentlessly on HOW some decision-makers get results and WHY most others don't. I recommend this book to individual executives, of course, but also to those involved in management training programs which involve others. (It would be terrific for developing \\"fast trackers.\\"). Also, if and when appropriate, this book in combination with Michael Hammer's The Agenda would be an excellent \\"homework assignment\\" to be completed prior to an executive retreat or (as some prefer) advance. Moreover, I think anyone in the management consulting business should also read it. If ever there was a time when clients expect those such as I to help them \\"get things done,\\" is it now.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Hammer's book as well as David Maister's Practice What You Preach, Jim O'Toole's Leading Change and The Executive's Compass, and Kaplan and Norton's The Strategy-Focused Organization.n-maker  (regardless of title or status) in any organization (regardless of size or nature) because the authors focus relentlessly on HOW some decision-makers get results and WHY most others don't.

1526103:US	51147790	R272S5NDPBOKSX	0375503242	284653166	At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America	Books	5	45	48	N	N	Perversions of "Justice"	Dray notes that he knew very little about lynchings when he began his research for this book; I knew very little about this subject until after I read his book. Perhaps I am not unique in that much of what I think I know and understand about U.S. history has depended to a significant extent on films and television programs. ... Many of the lynchings described in Dray's book would be deemed today as \\"unsuitable for viewing\\" by the general public and thus would never be fully portrayed in a film or television program. And yet, for reasons Dray explains, many of the lynchings attracted large and enthusiastic crowds (which included women and small children) and were scheduled to accommodate as many people as possible. Several hangings were preceded by dismemberment and burning.<br /><br />Dray's book is not primarily about such situations, although he traces lynching back to the American Revolution when Charles Lynch literally took the law into his own hands and hanged Tories who had stolen from him. A local court then exonerated his behavior. Dray explains that before the Civil War, more whites than blacks were lynched; that is, hanged without due process. It was only during the decades after the war ended that lynching became inextricably bound with racial strife as blacks were hanged in a progressively greater number and higher percentage than whites. Dray's extensive research of this period (roughly 1865-1900) provides some of the most interesting material in the book and his analysis of it is both rigorous and revealing. In many instances, the identities of those who conducted lynchings were concealed by white sheets or masks. Later, it was common to place a hood over the heads of those executed (after due process) by military, federal, or state officials.<br /><br />I view Dray as both an historian and an anthropologist. He tries hard to understand (and to help his reader to understand) why human beings throughout U.S. history grabbed a rope and hanged another human being. (For a period of time, multiple hangings were not uncommon.) Obviously, some of the lynchers who ignored due process were absolutely convinced that they were agents of justice; the motives of others are also understandable, perhaps, but nonetheless contemptible. I am grateful to Dray for the extensive research he completed and even more for his analysis of what that research revealed. Some readers may quarrel with some of his conclusions. (I am unqualified to do so.) However, I think almost all readers will view this book as an important contribution to our understanding of a recurrent pattern of behavior which, until now (at least for me), has been neglected, ignored, or worse yet denied.or a period of time, multiple hangings were not uncommon.)

As a non-scholar with a keen interest in the evolution of the Christian religion, I found this to be an exceptionally informative as well as well-written study of the earliest Christians in the years immediately following the crucifixion of Jesus. Of course, most of what most of us know about those years has been learned from reading the New Testament or perhaps from films which claim to be \\"faithful\\" to that era. Snyder carefully examines the works of Christian writers, of course, but also those of Jewish and Roman writers as well. He attempts to answer questions such as these:<br />1. Why were the post-crucifixion years (the so-called \\"Apostolic Age\\") perhaps \\"the most turbulent and terrifying period in all history\\"?<br />2. Nonetheless, why does it remain \\"such a murky period to even the most avid of history readers\\"?<br />3. According to the most reliable historical material available, who wrote what? For example, \\"the 21 epostles of the new Testament are arranged in scant regard to chronology, and scholars still debate when many of them were written.\\"<br />4. By which strategies and tactics did the so many of the early Christians survive amidst the \\"madness\\" of Roman rule throughout its empire and especially in Judea? Also, to what extent were the early Christians also subject to persecution by those who previously felt so threatened by a carpenter from Nazareth?<br />5. Which assumptions about the century following the crucifixion are now in doubt, if not invalidated by subsequent scholarship?<br />These and countless other questions are addressed throughout Snyder's well-written and insightful narrative. Not all of them are answered and perhaps some of those can never be. To suggest that in no way diminishes the nature and extent of what Snyder achieves in this volume. Rather, my purpose is to acknowledge the challenges he faced and thereby to indicate the substantial value of what he has accomplished.	2002-05-30

Predictably, \\"that depends\\" at which point in time correlations are drawn Both have exceptional intelligence and energy, a flare for drama, uncommon business acumen, and a passion to succeed...especially in a business world (then and now) dominated by men. It is important to keep in mind, however, that this book is a memoir from Lawrence's perspective whereas Byron's book (which apparently has infuriated Stewart) offers his perspective (not hers) on arguably the world's most successful businesswoman. Presumably at some point, Stewart will tell her own story just as others such as Bob Knight, Vernon Jordan, Jack Welch, and Sumner Redstone have in their own recently published memoirs.<br />Lawrence did indeed have a :\\"big life in advertising,\\" founding and then heading her own firm (Wells Rich Greene) for more than 30 years. Of special interest to me is what she has to say about the corporate leadership and management principles which guided and informed her during her three decades as a CEO. I agree with Ruth Shalit's characterization of that style as being \\"the CEO as It Girl, a jingle-writing, brand-building, Holly Golightly\\" but as Shalit then observes, \\"Ms. Wells Lawrence's blend of female emotionalism and careerist cunning is unlikely to delight management theorists or university synmposiasts.\\" In this instance, Lawrence really does seem to be \\"one of a kind,\\" as is Herb Kelleher, but surely there is much more to their success (in two of the most ferociously competitive marketplaces) than having a powerful personality. Lawrence will charm most of her readers, just as she must have charmed most of those with whom she was associated during the Wells Rich Greene period. Her agency is deservedly renowned for memorable campaigns to promote products such as Alka-Selzer, Pringles, and Bic lighters. Lawrence had a flair which characterized her agency and its work for such clients. She also had uncommon courage which she demanded of others: \\"I wanted a heroic agency. I dared everybody to be bold, to be thrilling, and I dared our clients to be bold and thrilling.\\" (Her courage later proved to be a decisive factor during her battle with cancer.) Over time, the terms of engagement and criteria for measuring success in the advertising world changed. Calling herself \\"an old fashioned girl,\\" Lawrence decided to sell her agency.<br />In certain respects, her account of the agency's final years under her leadership reminds me of the major changes which occurred as film studios were absorbed by multi-media international conglomerates. There was no longer any appropriate role for the \\"characters\\" who once ruled those studios, notably Goldwyn, Mayer, Zanuck, Cohn, and Selznick. As did they, Lawrence lived a \\"big life\\" in her own industry for as along as possible and then moved on. Unlike most of the displaced moguls, however, she indicates no bitterness and few regrets.

I was reminded of that theme as I read Judy Blunt's memoir. (I suggest no other comparisons of her work with Joyce's.) Both writers have a great deal of value to say about those who live lives of \\"quiet desperation.\\" In this book, Blunt speaks eloquently and sometimes with humor as she brilliantly describes her first 30 years in northeastern Montana, a period during which she worked on her family's ranch, graduated from high school, married, and gave birth to three children. For various reasons she shares in her book, Blunt eventually decided to leave her husband as well as a lifestyle which had by then become unendurable. During succeeding years, she began to organize and record her thoughts about life on a ranch for her and for the other women she knew. It is important to keep in mind that this is a memoir: It provides Blunt's observations and conclusions and from her own point of view. Presumably not everyone who knew her then agrees with everything she has to say.<br />Indeed, some may view this book as an indictment of the culture in which she lived, worked, struggled, and suffered throughout much of her life. (No doubt her former husband and father-in-law do.) For men as well as women, there was (and is) always so much to do to maintain a ranch. Prolonged periods of isolation within a human community whose population was diminishing. Harsh winters. Droughts. For women, contrary to the national average, a much briefer life span than for men because of inadequate healthcare and death in childbirth, with wives meanwhile required to maintain a workload (in addition to homemaking) which most men would find daunting. Also noteworthy: according to Blunt, women in this culture are wholly subservient to men in terms of any decisions concerning family members, the home, or the ranching business. In a word women were \\"powerless.\\" It was from such a life that Blunt fled, making as clean a break as she could.<br />Born and raised in Chicago, and having since lived in several other major cities, I am unable to identify with the way of life Blunt describes. However, over the years, I have frequently encountered men as well as women who also felt trapped in their lives. (Some described themselves as \\"prisoners.\\") They expressed feelings of being overworked as well as under appreciated, and (yes) powerless to seek a better life elsewhere. I am certain they and countless others can identify with the experiences Blunt shares in her book. It took courage for her to break away. To her credit, she did. Although it may not have been Blunt's intention,  perhaps (just perhaps) her book will help others to find the courage they also need to replace a life of \\"quiet desperation\\" with one which offers social freedom and personal fulfillment.family members, the home, or the ranching business.

For non-scholars such as I who have a keen interest in U.S. military history, this book provides information and analysis which are probably not available in any other single volume. Boot tracks various \\"small wars\\" during the rise of America's global power from the Barbary Wars (1801-1805, 1815) until the application of the \\"Powell Doctrine\\" during the Gulf War in the 1990s. In the final chapter, he then provides what he calls \\"In Defense of the Pax Americana: Small Wars in the Twenty-First Century.\\" Boot identifies four (among several) distinct types of small wars: Punitive (\\"to punish attacks on American citizens or property), Protective (\\"to safeguard foreign territory\\"), Pacification (\\"to occupy foreign territory\\"), and Profiteering (\\"To grab trade or or territorial concession\\"). For me, one of the book's greatest strengths is comprised of Boot's analysis of lesser-known but uniquely important historical figures such as Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy, Smedley D. Butler, Stephen Decatur, William Eaton, William Edmund (\\"Tiny\\") Ironside, Victor H. Krulak, Augusto C. Sandino, and Littleton W.T.. Waller. Within his narrative, he also analyzes the role played by each of various U.S. Presidents,  notably Jackson, Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Lyndon Baines Johnson, and George H.W. Bush.<br />I also wish to commend Boot on his brilliant analysis of the pivotal (often decisive) role played by the Marines Corps throughout more than 200 years of U.S. military history and, especially, his explanation of the importance of the The Small Wars Manual which the Marines created in the 1930s. This handbook grew out of the their own experiences in the early years of the 20th century as well as Britain's colonial involvements.  Here are two brief excerpts from the manual:<br />\\"As applied to the United States, small wars are operations undertaken under executive authority, wherein military force is combined with diplomatic pressure in the internal or external affairs of another state whose government is unstable, inadequate, or unsatisfactory for the preservation of life and of such interests as are determined by the foreign policy of our Nation.\\"<br />\\"In a major war, the mission assigned to the armed forces is usually unequivocal -- the defeat and destruction of the hostile forces. This is seldom true in small wars. [The more  ambiguous mission is] to establish and maintain law and order by supporting or replacing the civil government in countries or areas in which the interests of the United States have been placed in jeopardy.\\"<br />Thirty years later, as the war Viet Nam continued, it became obvious (at least to some) that the lessons to be learned from The Small Wars Manual may have been validated but, for whatever reasons, were either ignored or forgotten by President Johnson and others in his administration. With a new century underway, given the events of September 11th, it will be interesting to see to what extent (if any) the Marines' Small Wars Manual will guide and inform the allied response to global terrorism.<br />With regard to \\"the lessons of history,\\" Boot offers this advice in his book's final chapter: \\"In deploying American power, decisionmakers should be less apologetic, less hesitant, less humble. Yes, there is a danger of imperial overstretch and hubris -- but there is an equal, if not greater, danger of undercommitment and lack of confidence. America should not be afraid to fight `the savage wars of peace' if necessary to enlarge the empire of liberty.' It has done it before.\\"another state whose government is unstable, inadequate, or unsatisfactory for the preservation of life and of such interests as are determined by the foreign policy of our Nation.\\"<br />\\"In a major war, the mission assigned to the armed forces is usually unequivocal -- the defeat and destruction of the hostile forces.

Boyatzis.<br />How to describe Wanless' book? First of all, extensive research (his and others') has convinced him that intuition may well be the single most important, and potentially the most valuable, of all resources available to human beings as they struggle to understand themselves and the world in which they live and work. For most of us, we prefer to rely on our powers of reasoning, our personal experiences, and the judgment of others to make decisions, to assign value, and to select goals to pursue. As a result, we can sometimes deny or ignore what Wanless characterizes as a \\"life force\\" within each of us and thereby forfeit \\"extraordinary, perhaps even revolutionary, ways of comprehending ourselves.\\" I am reminded of the key point Ernest Becker makes in Denial of Death: Although no one can deny physical death, there is another death which we can deny. That is the death which occurs when we become wholly preoccupied with fulfilling others' expectations of us. Wanless asserts (and I agree) that trusting one's intuition can help us to identify and then fulfill what we expect of ourselves.<br />This book also provides a wealth of carefully selected quotations from various sources which are strategically placed within chapters which examine the potential \\"rewards\\" of intuition; what Wanless calls \\"the intuitive imperative\\"; intuitive decision-making, action, intention, vision, innovation, communication, fitness, and energy; and finally, \\"The Intuitive Future Life: A New Way of Being.\\" Obviously, the purpose of including the quotations is to reassure the reader that, for many of the most thoughtful and influential persons, intuition is given great value. Among all the hundreds of quotations, my personal favorites include:<br />\\"There is something within you that knows more than you know.\\" (Rochelle Myers)<br />\\"If I didn't define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people's fantasies for me and eaten alive.\\" (Audre Lorde)<br />\\"A great many think they are thinking, when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.\\" (William James)<br />\\"We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are.\\" (Anais Nin)<br />\\"I shut my eyes in order to see.\\" (Paul Gauguin)<br />This is a book which increases in value each time it is re-read. Although it has direct and practical relevance to the workplace, it can also help its reader (if receptive) to use the power of intuition to guide, nourish, and enrich her or his personal life. Wanless includes several hundred specific suggestions, drills, insights, and reassurances which -- collectively -- reveal and inform the potential power of intuition. The adjective \\"potential\\" is crucial to realizing the responsibility each person must assume. Wanless seems absolutely convinced that each and every reader can fulfill what is for most of us a latent and under-developed but nonetheless immensely promising source of wisdom and (yes) strength.uotations is to reassure the reader that, for many of the most thoughtful and influential persons, intuition is given great value.

(I hope he does so in another book at some later date.) This really is a \\"basic guide\\" and, as such, well-written. Blencoe does not claim to provide more than guidelines to \\"maximizing employee morale, motivation, and productivity.\\" The guidelines are sound, obviously based on a wealth of real-world experience which Blencoe has accumulated. The material is organized within seven chapters, each of which develops a key (albeit obvious) point: Surround yourself with high quality employees; replace unproductive employees; understand that all motivation stems from self-interest; tell employees what you expect of them, then don't micromanage; give praise instead of criticism [Note: My own opinion is that all praise should be expressed in public but that all constructive criticism should be expressed only in private.]; issue instructions in a respectful manner; and listen to employees. Blencoe then provides a \\"Bonus Chapter for High-Level Managers\\" in which he explains the importance of implementing a profit sharing program. He then offers a brief, heart-felt Conclusion in which he suggests that \\"When your choices are limited, just do the best you can with the resources available. That's all you can ever ask of yourself.\\"<br />What we have here is a primer rather than a full-length book such as any of Peter Drucker's or even a manual such as Rex P. Gatto's The Smart Manager's F.A.Q. Guide: A Survival Guide for Today's Workplace or Milgram, Spector, and Treger's Managing Smart: 325 High-Performance Tips Every Manager Must Know. For whom will Blencoe's book be most valuable? My own opinion is that it would be of greatest benefit to those who are about to assume responsibilty for supervising others or who have only recently done so. I strongly urge those who supervise them either to provide a copy or require them to obtain one, have them read it, and then meet with them to discuss each of the seven aforementioned key points. My own  extensive experience with inexperienced managers has convinced me that (a) they are under-prepared to supervise others effectively, and (b) the most effective managers at all levels throughout any organization are also those who are most effective in supporting their own supervisors.<br />So, if you are one of those relatively inexperienced managers, buy Blencoe's book. If you have relatively inexperienced managers reporting to you, buy a copy for each, then meet with them and discuss it. My personal preference is what I call an on-site \\"brown bag seminar.\\" The group discussion would focus on each of Blencoe's seven key points. The supervisor who leads the discussion should only ask questions, resisting the temptation to \\"explain\\" and/or reminisce. Blencoe encourages all of his readers to contact him directly at an e-mail address provided on the book's last page.

They were taken by Vermont Life magazine's contributing photographers, with a crisp and eloquent text provided by Tom Slayton. Technically, I guess, this would be called a \\"coffee table book\\" and indeed that is where it resides in my home, except when I pore through it again (which I do each day) or when a family member or guest does so. The reproduced art (which such great photography truly is) is organized logically and appropriately according to the four seasons. Many persons who have never visited Vermont perhaps think of it in association with the poetry of Robert Frost. There are many other locales elsewhere in New England (notably in northwest Connecticut and throughout New Hampshire and Maine) could just as easily provide images which Frost's poetry evokes. For me, however, there is a texture and there are certain nuances to Vermont (&quot;A State of Nature\\") which are unique. They are captured vividly in the stunning photographs provided in this volume.<br />Pretend that you have arrived in the state and have retained Slayton as your tour guide. \\"Take us to your favorite places. Help us to understand why you are so fond of each place. In other words, introduce us to Vermont at its best.\\" In essence, that is what this volume does. The initial impact is so great, so enjoyable, that you will wish to return again and again. A magnificent volume such as this enables you to do so. Those who share my passion for Vermont are urged to subscribe to Vermont Life magazine. Also, to purchase Richard W. Brown's The Soul of Vermont.	2002-05-14

Perhaps (just perhaps) those who wish to understand the life, career, and impact of Churchill should read several different books about the man and his times. Gilbert combines the narrative skills of a Dickens with the precision of a neurosurgeon. He has probably come as close as anyone can (or at least has thus far) to explaining, especially to those under 50 years of age, why Churchill was and remains among history's greatest leaders, orators, and writers of non-fiction. (I defer to others better qualified to evaluate his talent as a painter.) He comes to life in this book, to the extent a book can bring anyone to life. If you are interested in Churchill and wish to read only one book about him, this is it.	2002-05-14

We hope this book will be accessible, eminently usable, and inspiring in your life and work.\\" The material is presented within three Parts: The Challenge (which explains \\"why leadership is so dangerous and how people get taken out of the game\\"), The Response (which provides \\"a series of action steps designed to reduce the risk of getting pushed aside\\"), and Body and Soul (\\"which discusses \\"ways that people contribute to their own demise\\"), followed by a Notes section filled with especially informative annotations. Pogo once said \\"we have met the enemy and he is us.\\" More often than not, I think that is true. I also think that most human limits are self-imposed. That is probably what Henry Ford had in mind when he observed \\"Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.\\"<br />According to Heifetz and Linsky, \\"To lead is to live dangerously because when leadership counts, when you lead people through difficult change, you challenge what people hold dear -- their daily habits, tools, loyalties, and ways of thinking -- with more to offer perhaps than a possibility. Moreover, leadership often means exceeding the authority you are given to tackle the challenge at hand. People push back when you disturb the personal and institution equilibrium they know. And people resist in all kinds of creative and unexpected ways that can get you taken out of the game: pushed aside, undermined, or eliminated.\\" Throughout human history, most of the greatest leaders were \\"eliminated\\" precisely because they were perceived to be intolerable threats to what James O'Toole calls \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" Draw up a list of the 10-15 greatest leaders in history. How many of them died of natural causes? On my own list, only Winston Churchill and he was twice voted out of office amidst ridicule and even contempt. One of this book's greatest value-added benefits is the brief summary of key ideas which concludes each chapter. I strongly recommend that the book be re-read within 2-3 weeks; also, that at least the chapter summaries be reviewed weekly thereafter.<br />It is important to understand that Heifetz and Linsky view the subject of leadership in a much wider and deeper context than one normally encounters in a business book. Consider these brief remarks with which they conclude: \\" Opportunities for leadership are available to you, and to us, every day. But putting yourself on the line is difficult work, for the dangers are real. Yet the work has nobility and the benefits, for you and for those around you, are beyond measure. We have written this book out of admiration and respect for you and your passion. We hope that the words on these pages have provided both practical advice and inspiration; and that you have better means now to lead., protect yourself, and keep your spirit alive. May you enjoy with a full heart the fruits of your labor. The world needs you.\\"<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read Heifetz's previous book, Leadership Without Easy Answers.

Why? Because the authors of that book correctly stress the importance of maximizing organizational speed, agility, balance, and leverage in any competitive marketplace. What they do not address (except perhaps indirectly or by implication) is the importance of radical innovation which, more often than not, proves to be a decisive competitive advantage. Indeed, the seven authors of the book I am about to review identify \\"Seven Challenges in Managing Radical Innovation\\" (see Table 1-1 on page 8) and meeting these challenges effectively indeed requires maximizing organizational speed, agility, balance, and leverage. Obviously, no single volume asks all \\"the right questions,\\" much less provides \\"all the right answers.\\" Hence the importance of carefully correlating the ideas from several different sources. I also strongly Michael Hammer's The Agenda which offers a \\"model\\" by which decision-makers in any organization (regardless of its size or nature) can determine appropriate priorities and then set appropriate objectives before formulating strategies and tactics by which to achieve those objectives.<br />The subtitle of this book (\\"How Mature Companies Can Outsmart Upstarts\\") reminds me of Jack Welch's comments when explaining why he admires \\"small and sleek\\" companies:<br />\\"For one, they communicate better. Without the din and prattle of bureaucracy, people listen as well as talk; and since there are fewer of them they generally know and understand each other. Second, small companies move faster. They know the penalties for hesitation in the marketplace. Third, in small companies, with fewer layers and less camouflage, the leaders show up very clearly on the screen. Their performance and its impact are clear to everyone. And, finally, smaller companies waste less. They spend less time in endless reviews and approvals and politics and paper drills. They have fewer people; therefore they can only do the important things. Their people are free to direct their energy and attention toward the marketplace rather than fighting bureaucracy.\\"<br />For those who seek radical innovation in so-called \\"mature\\" companies, the  challenges which the authors of this book identify are obviously much greater than they are for those in the \\"small and sleek\\" companies which Welch admires. A majority of upstarts pursue a \\"judo strategy\\" (in one form or another) because they lack the resources of their much larger competitors. (David had no chance if he wrestled Goliath.) For that reason, they cannot afford incremental innovation. They must take bold, decisive action when and where it will have the greatest impact.<br />When explaining what they call an \\"imperative,\\" the authors of this book make a critically important distinction: \\"...incremental innovation usually emphasizes cost or feature improvements in existing products or services and is dependent on exploitation competencies. In contrast, radical innovation concerns the development of new businesses or product lines -- based on new ideas or technologies or substantial cost reductions -- that transform the economics of a business, and therefore require exploration competencies.\\" This is indeed a key distinction.<br />Much of the material in this book was generated by the authors' research over a period of five years (1995-2000) which followed the development and commercialization activities of 12 radical innovation projects in 10 large, established (\\"mature\\") firms. For the authors, a radical innovation project must have the potential to produce one or more of these results: an entirely new set of performance features, improvements in known performance features of five times or greater, and/or a significant (i.e. 30% or more) reduction in cost. What the authors learned from the research serves as the foundation of their conclusions; also of what they recommend to those who seek radical innovation in their own organization. All of the ideas presented are anchored in an abundance of real-world experience. Although this brilliant book's greatest value may be derived by decision-makers in \\"mature\\" companies, I think substantial value can also be derived by decision-makers in the \\"upstarts\\" with which such companies as DuPont, General Electric, General Motors, IBM, and Texas Instruments will continue to compete. One final point: All of the \\"mature\\" companies discussed in this book were once \\"upstarts\\" themselves. How revealing that all of them are now so hard at work on regaining or preserving certain competitive advantages which once served them so well.innovation in their own organization.

This is one of only a few books which, after having read it, I wish I had written it. Of course, I am wholly unqualified to undertake such a task. However, I would have thoroughly enjoyed completing the research required and taken full advantage of every opportunity to interview, personally, as many of the Jewish comedians as possible. Also, as many as possible of the (non-performing) Jewish writers of comedy such as Larry David, Larry Gelbart, and Neil Simon. In a brilliant Introduction, Epstein observes: \\"The story of Jewish comedians in America is one of triumph and success. But their stage smile is tinged with sadness. It is haunted by the Jewish past, by the deep stains in American Jewish life -- the desire to be accepted and the concern for a culture disappearing -- by the centuries of Jewish life too frequently interrupted by hate, and by the knowledge that too often for Jewish audiences, a laugh masked a shudder. The comedians' story in America includes bitter encounters with anti-Semitism and the lures of an attractive culture along the way. The jokes these comedians told, their gags, and their nervous patter need to be set alongside the obstacles they overcame.\\"<br /><br />In this volume, Epstein combines the skills of a disciplined historian and cultural anthropologist with a writing style which has Snap! Crackle! and Pop! Obviously, he also delights in the comic art of so many who \\"exemplified two great themes of American Jewish life: assimilation and the search for an American Jewish identity....Also, they made Jews proud\\" while entertaining them as well as ever-increasing numbers of others who also went to the movies, turned on radios and then television sets, sat in nightclubs of various sizes, and bought albums. I am so grateful to Epstein for providing throughout the book an abundance of comic material from scripts, films, published interviews, recordings, and other primary sources. He covers a period from 1890 until the present, organizing his material within four sections:<br /><br />The Golden Door and the Velvet Curtain (1890-1930)<br /><br />NOTE: Epstein creates a context frame-of-reference within which to begin to examine \\"the two great themes\\" as countless immigrants arrived in \\"the land of hope and tears.\\"  He then shifts his attention to The Age of Vaudeville.<br /><br />The Years of Fear (1930-1950)<br /><br />NOTE: This was a period during which there were many fears (e.g. poverty, world war, nuclear weapons, Communism) shared by most Americans. Epstein examines what he calls radio's \\"finest hour\\" as well as films which had their audiences \\"laughing in the dark.\\" He then shifts his attention to the rise of the Borscht Belt.<br /><br />The Years of Acceptance (1950-1965)<br /><br />NOTE: Epstein examines the American Television Revolution and then the emergence of stand-up comedy, devoting special attention to Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, and Jack Benny as well as to Lenny Bruce, Myron Cohen, Jack E. Leonard, Buddy Hackett, Alan King, Jackie Mason, Shelley Berman, and Woody Allen.<br /><br />The Years of Triumph (1965-Present)<br /><br />NOTE: In this final section, Epstein traces the further development and refinement of \\"the two great themes\\" of American Jewish life (i.e. assimilation and the search for an American Jewish identity) and I enjoyed reading this section more than any of its three predecessors. In it, Epstein takes a close look at the films of Woody Allen and Mel Brooks (among several discussed) and then shifts his attention to Rodney Dangerfield, Don Rickles, Andy Kaufman, Howard Stern, various Jewish comediennes, Jerry Seinferld, and (in the final chapter) an emerging generation of young Jewish comedians.<br /><br />In the Appendix, \\"Schlemiels and Nudnicks,\\" Epstein shares his final thoughts which help the reader to re-establish an overall perspective on material which covers a period of more than 100 years. (It could reasonably be claimed that Epstein has examined certain themes and forces which have been active within Jewish culture for several thousand years.)  He concludes that \\"the comics who emerged from this Jewish background were not aware of psychological or sociological theories. As George Burns noted, they were not hungry for recognition, \\"they were hungry for food. They did not question their humor but rather just recognized and used it. Nevertheless, the roles comedians played and most particularly the contributions of Eastern European Jewish culture shaped the personalities of these comedians and lay, either hidden or not, in their minds.\\"<br /><br />For me, a Gentile, it is impossible to determine to what extent Jewish comedy became assimilated within American society, and, to what extent Jewish comedy helped American society became assimilated with Jewish values. Let's all call it a tie and consider ourselves that much the better for it..)

This book seems totally honest, at times so honest it was painful for me to absorb and digest what was being shared. What a full life Loretta Lynn has had thus far! She had given birth to four of six children by the time she was 21. With a combination of \\"true grit\\" and unique talent, the coal miner's daughter developed and then sustained a career which earned her great wealth and popularity, eventually earning her a rightful place in her industry's Hall of Fame. But consider all of the health problems (both mental and physical) she somehow overcame along the way; consider, also, her marital problems with Doolittle Lynn, most of which she concealed in her first autobiography, Coal Miner's Daughter (first published in 1976), on which an award-winning film was based (1980). And consider all that she now shares in this book with the general public, much of it for the first time. To her credit, she assumes personal responsibility for many of her travails. If anything, on occasion she seems to blame herself too much as when discussing her volatile marriage to a man who was an abusive alcoholic and compulsive womanizer. It has been more than 25 years since the publication of Coal Miner's Daughter. This book covers most of the joy and heartache in recent years but also provides information (and especially perspectives) on her youth. For me, one of the book's most interesting components consists of all the personal and professional relationships Lynn had with others in her industry. She and they share a concept of \\"family\\" which may well have helped to compensate for the insufficiencies and agonies of her domestic life. All I know about Loretta Lynn is limited almost entirely to two books, one film, and her recordings. I am by no means an authority on country western music but conclude these brief comments on Still Woman Enough by expressing my great admiration of the courage and candor she expresses in it.brief comments on Still Woman Enough by expressing my great admiration of the courage and candor she expresses in it.	2002-05-13

I am one of countless Americans who are actively involved in franchising almost every day (if only as a consumer) and have become dependent on others to provide various goods and services. In most instances, the emphasis is on speed and convenience. Others do for me and my family either what we cannot do (e.g. dry clean clothes) or would prefer not to do (e.g. install and balance new tires). Almost all of the franchises with which we do business are privately-owned.<br />Until I read Birkeland's book, I knew almost nothing about franchising except as a consumer. And frankly, I never thought about franchising. I simply assumed that all of those who work for various \\"quick\\" whatevers, for example, are employees of the same company. Not true. In the year 2000, in the U.S. alone, more than 2,000 companies in 75 industries will manage approximately 400,000 franchisees. \\"In turn, these franchisees collectively manage nearly 8 million workers, or approximately 1 out of every 16 employed persons in the U.S. economy.\\" Hmmm. What impact has all this had on the so-called \\"Mom and Pop\\" (family-owned) business? According to Birkeland, the retail sales that flow through franchise companies is about $1 trillion or one-third of the entire (repeat, entire) U.S. gross domestic product. The corporate parents of most major chains (e.g. hotel and motel, fast food, and donuts) own few of the local businesses which bear their \\"brand\\" name.<br />So, who owns most of them? Why do they own them? How does it work? What's involved? And also, have these local (or perhaps regional) owners made a shrewd investment? Birkeland answers these and countless other questions, most of which I hadn't even thought to ask. For me, this book was an eye-opener in many ways beyond educating me to the extent and impact of franchising within the national economy. I was also surprised to learn the \\"nuts and bolts\\" of franchising as an ever-increasing number of people pursue the American Dream which, in essence, combines both the excitement and the terror of entrepreneurship.<br />Here in a single volume, Birkeland provides a wealth of information about franchise fundamentals, examines three chains (King Cleaners, Sign Masters, and Star Muffler), presents a \\"social profile\\" of franchisees, explains correlations between networks and alliances with survival, notes various franchisor \\"uncertainties, analyzes the nature and extent of control from various perspectives, and concludes with an Epilogue in which he observes, \\"The critical problem of controlling geographically dispersed workers is tractable for those franchisors who establish high levels of trust with franchisees. For those who cannot achieve that, the problem of control is a never-ending battle.\\" Those who lose that battle experience what is, in various forms, the American Nightmare.<br />I rate this book so highly for two reasons. (Were I thinking about becoming a franchisee, I would have a third reason.) First, I learned a great deal about a segment of society in which I continue to be actively involved as a consumer. The information and insights Birkeland provides enable me to appreciate how important that segment is to the national economy. Second, while reading his book, I also gained a better understanding of the sociological, indeed anthropological implications of that segment, just as I did when reading Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation and Barbara Ehrenreich's Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America. I highly recommend all three, especially to those who are now considering an investment in a fast food franchise.nce, combines both the excitement and the terror of entrepreneurship. <br />Here in a single volume, Birkeland provides a wealth of information about franchise fundamentals, examines three chains (King Cleaners, Sign Masters, and Star Muffler), presents a \\"social profile\\" of franchisees, explains correlations between networks and alliances with survival, notes various franchisor \\"uncertainties, analyzes the nature and extent of control from various perspectives, and concludes with an Epilogue in which he observes, \\"The critical problem of controlling geographically dispersed workers is tractable for those franchisors who establish high levels of trust with franchisees.

Growing up in South Chicago, I saved every penny I could from paper routes, caddying, setting pins at the local bowling alley (which, yes, dates me), cutting lawns, washing cars, and stocking the shelves of the local grocery inorder to afford going to as many Cubs and White Sox games as my funds allowed. Otherwise, I listened to radio broadcasts of home and away games. Our family was the first in the neighborhood to have a television set; I could then watch the games with my grandmother, another diehard baseball fan. She loved the Cubs, endured the White Sox, and shared my excitement when World Series games were televised. So much for where I have been and still come from. Today, for various reasons, I have much less interest in Major League baseball.<br />Also up front, I want to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Tofel's account of the Yankees' 1939 season. It is exceptionally well-written. True, thanks to several dozen books I have already read, I already knew much of what he shares in this volume. Even so, he enabled me to return to a very special season in the history of Major League baseball, one during which there were so many transitions occurring. For example, Lou Gehrig was deteriorating (dying, in fact) while Joe DiMaggio was taking his rightful place as one of the greatest Yankees among so many outstanding players. The book follows an obvious but appropriate format: Pre-Game Warm-Up, followed by one chapter per each of nine Innings, then a Post-Game Report.  Along the way, Tofel focuses on the key players and on the key games with the Yankees' strongest competitors. Along the way, when not recounting action on the field, Tofel pauses to discuss -- with sensitivity as well as insight -- human relationships which were neither revealed nor acknowledged until many years alter.<br />Some have challenged Tofel's use of the word\\" pure\\" but I do not. I think he means that the quality of play in combination with the professionalism of the players \\"between the lines\\" invested that Yankee team with a certain purity of deportment. Of course, at that time, players were literally owned by the teams which employed them. True, the color barrier would not be overcome until eight years later (1947), about the same time the U.S. military services were finally integrated. It was not until 1954 that the U.S. Supreme Court declared school segregation constitutionally illegal. Then and now, our society was not perfect and Tofel nowhere suggests otherwise.<br />Given all that, the 1939 Yankees handled themselves with uncommon style and grace...with a self-assurance many then viewed as arrogance. Nonetheless, even today, when wearing the pinstripes and playing in Yankee Stadium as a Yankee for the first time, veteran players such as Jason Giambi say that they get goose bumps and feel lightheaded. Until 1939, that was probably not true. After they won the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds, the players' brief celebration in the clubhouse was cut short by manager Joe McCarthy: \\"Cut that out! What are you, a lot of amateurs? I thought I was managing a professional club. Why, you're worse than college guys.\\" The chastised players then listened silently and intently as McCarthy shared his thoughts about \\"lost games they might have won during the championship season.\\"<br />For whatever it may be worth, the only other books on baseball which I enjoyed reading as much as this one are Red Smith on Baseball and Roger Kahn's The Boys of Summer.

Indeed, statistics is in many areas the only way we can make a scientifically sound description of the world.\\" Moreover, in this book he suggests, \\"My aim has been to give a description of the approaches to [environmental] problems, as the experts themselves have presented them in relevant books and journals, and to examine the different subject-areas from a perspective as allows us to evaluate their importance in the overall social prioritization.\\" Finally, Lomborg suggests, \\"The key idea is that we ought not to let the environmental organizations, business lobbyists or the media be alone in presenting truths and priorities. Rather, we should strive for a careful democratic check on the environmental debate, by knowing the real state of the world -- having knowledge of the most important facts and connections in the essential areas of the world. It is my hope that this book will contribute to such an understanding.\\"<br />Lomborg organizes his material as follows. Part I: The Litany (as indicated in the Oxford University Press's Young Oxford Books: \\"The balance of nature is essential for life. Humans have upset that balance, stripping the land of its green cover, choking the air, and poisoning the seas.\\"); Part II: Human welfare (Lomborg concludes that, despite various serious problems,  \\"unprecedented human prosperity\\" calls The Litany into question.); Part III: Can prosperity continue? (Lomborg asserts that \\"our society certainly seems to be sustainable\\" and thereby, again questions The Litany.); Part IV: Pollution: does it undercut prosperity? (According to Lomborg, \\"As far as the vast majority of significant areas are concerned, we have reduced pollution and increased environmental quality.\\"); Part V: Tomorrow's problems (Given the facts rather than subjective assumptions, Lomborg asserts, \\"if we want to leave a planet with the most possibilities for our descendants, in both the developing and developed world, it is imperative that we focus primarily on the economy and solving our problems in a global context rather than focusing -- in the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] lingo -- on the environment in a regionalized context.\\"); and Part VI: The Real State  of the World (\\"Thus, this is the very message of the book: children born today -- in both in the industrialized world and developing countries -- will live longer and be healthier, they will get more food, a better education, a higher standard of living, more leisure time and far more possibilities -- without the physical world being destroyed.

I thought about that as I recently re-read this brilliant book, first published in 1994. Those who assume leadership responsibilities frequently encounter stiff resistance and sometimes place themselves at great risk. Two of the three great leaders whom Heifetz examines in this book, Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr., were assassinated. (The third is Lyndon Baines Johnson.) There are seldom easy solutions to the most difficult problems and seldom easy answers to the most important questions. Heifetz acknowledges that great leaders are guided by non-negotiable values, to be sure, and sustained by a deep faith in a worthy cause but they are also realists. That is, they have a clear-headed understanding of the perils they face. Draw up a list of the 10-15 greatest leaders in history. How many of them died of natural causes? On my own list, only Winston Churchill and he was twice voted out of office amidst ridicule and even contempt.<br />Heifetz organizes his material within Four Parts: Setting the Frame, Leading With Authority, Leading Without Authority, and Staying Alive. The book's final section is intended to be a \\"theoretical framework for understanding leadership and authority in the context of adaptive change.\\" It is important to understand that Heifetz views the subject of leadership in a much wider and deeper context than one normally encounters in a business book. The world has never before needed leaders as much as it does today, in large measure because never before has the world been as dangerous as it is today. (Weapons of mass destruction can accomplish in only a few hours what once took plagues years and even decades to accomplish.) We desperately need effective leaders in all areas of human activity. According to Heifetz, such leaders will probably be ignored, at first, and then ridiculed. When they begin to attract others to their cause, they will be rigorously opposed. If and when they become sufficiently dangerous, either to their opponents or (yes) to those who once supported them, they will be \\"eliminated\\"  in one way or another. Have we learned nothing from the past? Heifetz obviously has. After almost 15 years of research on those who provide leadership in all manner of organizations and institutions, he shares what he has learned. I wish a higher rating were available.<br />Readers who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out the more recently published Leadership On the Line which Heifetz co-authored with Marty Linsky; also David Maister's Practice What You Preach, James O'Toole's Leading Change, and Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan's Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done.attract others to their cause, they will be rigorously opposed.

Don't be deterred by the title. (Initially, I was.) It was probably selected for marketing purposes. Sharma and Moody know better than to claim that the system they propose (what they call \\"LeanSigma Transformation Process\\") is in all ways -- and will remain forever -- a \\"perfect engine\\" by which to achieve \\"profitable growth that serves all the constituents of an enterprise.\\" Any system is only as effective as those involved within it. We all know how many perfect workers there are. What Sharma and Moody present in this volume is a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system by which to meet all manner of challenges by \\"building to order with fewer resources.\\" Presumably they would be the first to point out that any such system, presented in a book, must be modified to accommodate the specific needs, interest, objectives, and resources of a given organization. Moreover, although the primary focus is on manufacturing, the principles are so sound that they can also be of substantial value to non-manufacturing enterprises such as those in retail merchandising, management consulting, banking, accounting, legal, insurance, and even advertising. All organizations need to improve cycle time and first-pass yield. Also, all organizations must do that with finite (sometimes severely limited) resources. Finally, all organizations most become (literally) obsessed with kaizen: constant improvement. Therefore, I highly recommend this book to decision-makers in all organizations (regardless of size or nature) but with the single caveat that appropriate modifications of the LeanSigma Transformation Process first be made.<br />Sharma and Moody carefully organize their excellent material within ten chapters. In the first, they suggest and then explain \\"A Better Way\\"; in the last, they shift their attention to \\"The Future.\\" Throughout their book, they make effective use of the \\"journey\\" metaphor, correctly asserting that, once begun, the LeanSigma Transformation Process never ends. \\"This is a journey that concentrates the energy of an entire enterprise and focuses efforts to serve customers better, faster, with better quality products and responsiveness, ultimately leading to gains in market share.\\" Several dozen mini-case studies (e.g. Maytag) demonstrate precisely HOW such objectives can be achieved. In the final chapter, Sharma and Moody offer these thoughts: \\"Keep the long-term perspective. This journey is part of a larger movement, just as kaizen breakthrough is the the enabler of LeanSigma Transformation, and Design for LeanSigma revolutionized process and product design for increased responsiveness and mass customization. [The current business circumstances worldwide] create a long-awaited window of opportunity, and it is our responsibility to be prepared, to have the best workers, the best tools, and the energetic leadership required because an opportunity like this comes only once in every hundred and fifty years.\\"<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out David Maister's Practice What You Preach, Michael Hammer's The Agenda, Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan's Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done, and James O'Toole's Leading Change.ends. \\"This is a journey that concentrates the energy of an entire enterprise and focuses efforts to serve customers better, faster, with better quality products and responsiveness, ultimately leading to gains in market share.\\" Several dozen mini-case studies (e.g. Maytag) demonstrate precisely HOW such objectives can be achieved.

Our primary metaphor comes from the sport of judo, which originated in late nineteenth-century Japan. Judo requires quickness, agility, and the ability to outmaneuver the competition. Most important, in judo, unlike many martial arts, true strength comes from turning your opponent's weight and power to your advantage.\\" The other principal metaphor is derived from sumo wrestling (i.e. making the most of one's strength and power\\")  which the authors concede \\"can be a very sensitive topic for the very large companies that are most likely to profit from\\" techniques which such advantages permit.<br />Yoffie and Kwak carefully organize their excellent material within three Parts: Principles of Judo Strategy (Chapters 1-4), Masters of Judo Strategy (Chapters 5-7), and Responding to Judo Strategy (Chapters 8 and 9). In the final chapter, they offer and then explain five \\"Rules\\" to follow when pursuing a Judo Strategy: (1) Maintain a deep focus on your core strategy, (2) Stay on the offensive but avoid frontal assaults, (3) Plan and be prepared to pivot, (4) Look for leverage in the strangest places, and (5) Face the music. While pursuing a Judo Strategy, it is also important to remember that \\"judo is ultimately a zero-sum game, and business, often times, is not. Moreover, in judo, you can focus solely on a single opponent, while in business, other groups, especially customers, require your attention.\\"<br />Clearly, Yoffie and Kwak fully understand the parameters of relevance of the two principal metaphors. Neither is a \\"bullet\\" (silver or otherwise) which always hits the designated target. Moreover, judo strategists may well find themselves in competition with judo strategists in another organization. In that event, those who move faster, are more agile, maintain better balance, apply greater leverage, and are better able to outmaneuver the competition will prevail. One of this book's greatest benefits is derived from what the authors learned during their interviews of various \\"masters\\" of judo strategy such as Jeff Hawkins and Donna Dubinsky of Palm Computing, Rob Glaser of RealNetworks, and Halsey Minor and Shelby Bonnie of CNET Networks. Not all of their circumstances and experiences are necessarily relevant to each reader's. For that reason, I urge those who read this book to focus on understanding the basic principles of judo strategy, then formulate a strategy  (based on those principles) which will enable their specific organization (regardless of its size or nature) to move faster, be more agile, maintain better balance, and apply greater leverage so that it will outmaneuver its own competition. Together with those whom they interviewed, Yoffie and Kwak explain HOW.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Guy Kawasaki's How to Drive Your Competition Crazy: Creating Disruption for Fun and Profit, Adam Morgan's Eating the Big Fish: How Challenger Brands Can Compete Against Brand Leaders, Don Taylor and Jeanne Smalling Archer's Up Against the Wal-Marts: How Your Business Can Prosper in the Shadow of the Retail Giants, and Samuel B.

One result was, that my curiosity about this complicated subject was stimulated to learn more about it even as, meanwhile, I now share information with those who read this review.  There has been a \\"social life of information\\" since the first time one human being communicated with another. Over time, man has devised all manner of ways to overcome various barriers to effective communication (barriers which include  distance and cost) with inventions such as the printing press, telegraph, telephone, radio, television, and computer. Never before has there been more information available than there is now; moreover, never before has there been more and better ways by which to share it. In this volume, Brown and Duguid examine major technological achievements in terms of the gap between what each has contributed to society thus far, and, what each could yet contribute.<br />Of special interest to me is the as yet unfulfilled potential of telecommunications convergence  For example, consider my situation. Atop a large table in my study, I have a computer, a printer, a facsimile machine, a DSL modem, and an adjustable lamp as well as a cordless telephone housed within a unit which records messages. Beneath this same table, there are more than 200,000 wires and cables. In the living room nearby, I have a television set; on top of it, a VCR, a DVD player, and some kind of box which AT&amp;T Broadband installed. We need to have four different remote control devices near at hand. Only my wife knows which one to use when. Behind the television set, approximately 53,000 wires and cables. Oh sure, if I wished to spend the money, I could have someone come in and achieve in both areas the convergence to which I referred. Having read this book, I now view the current communications situation as being anti-social while conceding that at least I do not need a separate television set for each channel I wish to view.<br />Brown and Duguid know exactly what I am talking about. With uncommon precision as well as eloquence, they urge their reader to consider quite carefully what information is, how it can be exchanged, and why the nature and extent of that exchange are among the defining characteristics of any society. They observe, &quot;Technology design often takes aim at the surface of life. There it undoubtedly scores lots of worthwhile hits. But such successes can make designers blind to the difficulty of more serious challenges--primarily the resourcefulness that helps embed certain ways of doing things deep in our lives.&quot; This is precisely what James O'Toole has in mind when, in Leading Change, he refers to what he calls \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\"<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Albert Borgmann's Holding On to Reality: The Nature of Information at the Turn of the Millennium, Douglas S.

This is a thoughtful, practical, no-nonsense book which will probably be of greatest value to owners/CEOs of smaller organizations. Sturgeon and Fitzpatrick obviously draw upon a wealth of real-world experience as they provide what amounts to a \\"reality check\\" for decision-makers who are currently unwilling and/or unable to extricate themselves from day-to-day (hour-to-hour) firefighting. The excellent material is carefully organized within 12 chapters, followed by \\"A Work Sheet for Taking Action.\\" Throughout the cohesive narrative, Sturgeon and Fitzpatrick suggest almost 200 \\"tools\\" and, at this point in my review, I offer a word of caution. As one of my favorite aphorisms suggests, if all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. It would be lunacy to agree with everything Sturgeon and Fitzpatrick say, worse yet to implement all of their suggestions. Think of them as co-proprietors of a \\"hardware store\\" for entrepreneurs. Tag along as they show you what they have available. Pretend that you have a \\"tool box\\" and fill it only with what will be most helpful now, today, but remember which other \\"tools\\" are also available. You may need several of them later, and perhaps sooner than you now think. With regard to \\"A Work Sheet for Taking Action,\\" I offer the same advice. Modify it to ensure that it is wholly appropriate to your own organization's specific needs, interests, strengths, weaknesses, resources, opportunities, etc.<br />I also recommend this book to those only recently embarked on a business career as well as to others now in middle-management positions who are taking on increasingly more important responsibilities in larger organizations. The business principles which Sturgeon and Fitzpatrick affirm will enable less-experienced executives to make better decisions themselves, and, to play a more active, more productive role when involved with others in a decision-making process.

Therefore, when a book appears which purports to explain the \\"way\\" of the most prestigious management consultant firm, it is certain to attract a great deal of attention and this one did. Having been involved in a number of strategic alliances over the years, ones which also involved McKinsey executives, I really expected much more from this book than it does in fact deliver. (I have the same opinion of its sequel, The McKinsey Mind, which I do not intend to review.) I recall a period years ago when the Boston Celtics were consistently winning NBA championships. At the annual All-Star game, the East squad ran Celtic plays because they were the only plays everyone knew. Lombardi's Green Bay Packer teams ran the same offense and defense season after season while winning NFL titles. What's my point? Perhaps what differentiates McKinsey from all other major management consulting firms. (whatever that \\"what\\" or \\"way\\" is) cannot be explained in a book and will only be revealed over time in direct and frequent contact with McKinsey executives. This book may be of some value to middle managers but there are so many other books which offer more and better guidance. Ironically, many of those books were written by former McKinsey partners.	2002-04-30

He continues to display a unique talent for focusing on a key point and then expressing it clearly and concisely. Unlike many other business authors, Fox may re-examine certain themes (e.g. appropriate mindsets for a decision-maker) but almost never recycles material. That is especially true of this volume in which he shares feedback for a rather long list of executives who are listed in the \\"Contributors\\" section. Many years ago, Sir Isaac Newton observed that \\"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\\" That is not to suggest that Fox is a a midget; rather, to suggest that he is an active and receptive student of those who -- in this instance -- are all great \\"bosses.\\" A brief word about \\"boss.\\" Obviously, few executives become a CEO but all executives -- directly or indirectly -- can have a profound impact on those for whom they are responsible. In this volume, Fox suggests what a \\"great boss\\" is...and isn't. He also explains why.<br />He organizes his material within 50 brief but insightful chapters, followed by an \\"Epilogue,\\" a series of personal statements by various senior-level executives which compellingly illustrate how and why \\"Great Bosses Beget Great Bosses.\\" The inverse is also true: \\"Ineffective Bosses Beget Ineffective Bosses.\\" For example, on a scale of 1-10, a 6 or 7 boss never hires a 9 or 10. Moreover, my own experience suggests that if and when a 6 or 7 inadvertently hires a 9 or 10 (or one with the capabilities to become one), the 6 or 7 either runs the 9 or 10 off or ensures that the development of that promising person is suppressed. \\"Great bosses\\" are never threatened by a 9 or 10. On the contrary, they only hire the best and the brightest. Fox urges his reader to spend supervisory time with the best people because \\"the top 10-20% of the employees [in any organization] deliver 70-80% of the results.\\"<br />Obviously, I think very highly of this slim but informative book. Those who share my high regard for it are urged to check out Buckingham and Coffman's First, Break All the Rules; Goleman, Boyatzis, and McKee's Primal Leadership; Maister's Practice What You Preach; O'Toole's The Executive's Compass; Whyte's The Heart Aroused; and finally, Bossidy and Charan's Execution: The Discipline of Getting Results.but informative book.

In this volume, he provides interviews with eight great directors: Hitchcock, Capra, Minimill, Cukor, Hawks, Wellman, Vidor, and Walsh. In recent weeks, I have also read Robert J. Emery's two The Directors (Take One and Take Two) and Bogdanovich's Who the Devil Made It which also offer interviews and conversations with various great directors. Don't worry about duplications; that is,  what Cukor, Hawks, Hitchcock, Walsh, and Wellman have to say. Bogdanovich, Emery, and Schickel have different questions to ask, different nuances of film making to explore, and approach the directors from quite different perspectives. The responses they obtain from the same directors differ. For that reason, I strongly urge fellow film buffs to purchase all of these volumes. The order in which they are read is unimportant.<br />What differentiates Schickel from Bogdanovich and Emery is the fact that, for many years, he wrote film reviews for Time magazine and thus had an immense audience with which to share his opinions about more than a thousand films. Also, he is the author of more than 20 books about film making which include biographies of Marlon Brando, Cary Brando, and James Cagney. Over the years, he has earned and richly deserves his reputation as one of the most thoughtful and knowledgeable of film authorities. In this volume, he interacts with eight of the greatest film directors. At no time does he seem intimidated by them nor does he ever disrupt the flow of information exchanged with self-serving observations. He guides each director into subject areas which are probably of great interest to most film buffs but he also allows each director to ramble, digress, etc. when reminiscing or when sharing specific opinions about films and actors with whom they were associated. Sure, there is some delicious gossip. And yes, some insights not otherwise available. However, for the most part, Schickel sets up various subjects and then allows each director (many of them a personal friend) to proceed wherever he may wish, at whatever pace he may prefer. His brilliant orchestration of responses ensures their scope and depth. That is to say, he did not merely turn on the recorder and then let each of the eight take it from there. On his reader's behalf, Schickel remains actively involved, indeed engaged in the exchange of information but at no time is intrusive. Within its genre, this is indeed a \\"classic.\\"some insights not otherwise available.

It is important to keep in mind that these are conversations rather than interviews such as those conducted by Robert J. Emery in The Directors: Take One and its sequel, The Directors Take Two, as well as interviews conducted by Richard Schickel in The Men Who Made the Movies. It is also worth noting that Bogdanovich is himself a distinguished director of films such as The Last Picture Show, What's Up, Doc?, They All Laughed (a personal favorite of mine), and Texasville. As a result of his own background, Bogdanovich's questions and comments reflect somewhat different interests and perspectives than do those of Emery and Schickel.<br />I rate all of these books Five Stars but probably enjoyed reading Bogdanovich's book the most because the conversations ramble along somewhat messily, as most of my own conversations tend to do, and also because Bogdanovich is more actively involved in the interaction than Emery and Schickel are. As a reader, I feel as if I were really an eavesdropper as 16 directors casually share their opinions, information about specific films and actors, gossip, \\"war stories,\\" and overall evaluations of their careers' various successes and failures. At no time does Bogdanovich seem intrusive or manipulative. Moreover, perhaps to an extent he did not realize when writing this book, he also reveals a great deal about himself...much of it endearing and some of it admirable. His passion for film making and his appreciation of the great directors are almost palpable. Readers' interests about various directors and their respective films obviously vary. I include myself among those who are die-hard film buffs and so I enjoyed reading every chapter and every word in each chapter. Indeed, each conversation was for this amateur \\"gourmet\\" a feast to be consumed with delight and, yes, gratitude.r and every word in each chapter.

Whyte requires of his reader a rigorous as well as truthful self-exploration, and in ways and to an extent few other authors do. As is so often true in other dimensions of human experience, the benefits derived from reading his book are almost wholly dependent upon how much is personally invested in it. As Whyte explains, he wrote this book \\"hoping it would be read in two ways. First, as a good story about the difficulties and dramas of preserving the soul at work -- in short, a page-turner; second, as a book that could be studied, contemplated, and discussed with others.\\" More than 50 years ago, Mortimer Adler affirmed the value of reading the \\"great books\\" because they stimulate and enrich what he called \\"a conversation across the centuries.\\" I think this is what Whyte has in mind when providing, in the book's final section (a \\"User's Guide\\"), a number of thoughts for reflection and discussion as well as for self-questioning. For example: \\"What is my heart's desire in life? What are some of the particularities of the way I like to live? What are the essential qualities that give me a sense of belonging? How can work be a good servant to my essential nature instead of a taskmaster?\\" As I now reflect on this book after a second reading, I think its greatest value lies not only in the truth of what Whyte expresses so eloquently but also in what his assertions and questions require his readers to consider as they seek spiritual fulfillment in their own lives. Those who my high regard for this book are urged to read Whyte's other books, especially Crossing the Unknown: Work as a Pilgrimage of Identity and Fire in the Earth; also, to check out David Maister's Practice What You Preach and Tim Sanders' Love Is the Killer App as well as Eliyahu M. Goldratt's The Goal, Critical Acclaim, and It's Not Luck.	2002-04-25

Specifically, problems such as those caused by illiteracy, immorality, poverty, hunger, violent crime, fraud, and loss of faith in various institutions such as government at federal and state levels, law enforcement, the legal system, and even religious denominations such as the Roman Catholic Church). Since \\"9/11,\\" there has been widespread disagreement about how to wage an effective \\"war\\" on terrorism (especially in the U.S.) while protecting human rights, even of non-citizens whose loyalty to our nation may be suspect.<br />In this volume, Fox addresses questions such as these: Why are certain core values essential to our personal as well as national well-being? Are these secular values compatible with the values of various religious faiths? How and by whom have so many of these values been subverted or at least threatened? Why? And why are these values so vulnerable to subversion? To what extent (if any) should the values in our schools the the same values of our community and nation? Why? Why has there been a decline of basic values in the American political system? What must be done to restore their primacy? Also, why has there been a decline of basic values in the American legal system? What must be done to restore their primacy? Obviously, these are important questions to pose. Whether or not readers fully agree with Fox's responses to them is, I think, much less important than the fact that his responses force us to consider, better yet reconsider what we may now think about  prevailing, indeed dominant values as the new century proceeds.<br />One of my greatest concerns, one with which Fox may agree, is that there has also been a serious decline of the quality of discussion of American values. This is perhaps most evident when viewing network and local newscasts, various \\"talk shows,\\" and even single-subject \\"specials.\\" More often than not, immensely complicated issues are addressed with sound bites, simplistic explanations, and self-serving posturing. I fear that we are now at a point in our nation's history when it is politically incorrect to tell the emperor that he not only has no new clothes but, worse yet, he is stark naked.<br />What to do about all this? Fox offers his own quite specific, indeed eloquent suggestions. Each is worthy of careful consideration. If you disagree, fair enough. Long ago, Voltaire suggested &quot;We should cherish those who seek the truth but beware of those who find it....(for all time or without adequate current, objective substantiation).&quot; Our search for truth must continue. Fox insists (and I agree) that, en route, our journey must be guided and informed by certain values which are even more important now than when they guided and informed the creation of a new nation. Those basic values have not declined; rather, we have neglected, ignored, or compromised them...and as a nation, we have lost our way.  Other nations look to ours for leadership. Literally, we are what we believe. Therefore, our effectiveness as a global leader as well as our health as a society will be wholly determined by the same moral and ethical infrastructure. \\"We hold these truths to be self-evident....\\" and always must.oceeds. <br />One of my greatest concerns, one with which Fox may agree, is that there has also been a serious decline of the quality of discussion of American values.

1568020:US	51147790	REUHB2MN2ZBHL	0471123005	787745487	Martha Inc.: The Incredible Story of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia	Books	5	40	44	N	N	The Best and the Worst in a Unique Combination	Byron does indeed tell an \\"incredible story\\" about one of the most successful businesswomen in the world. How much of it is credible? Is she really as brilliant and resourceful as he suggests? Is she also as spiteful and mean-spirited as he suggests? As I read this book, I sometimes had a difficult time determining what Byron makes of the material he shares. His attitude seems ambivalent as indeed do those who have worked for and with Stewart over the years. Much of the material was provided by friends, enemies, acquaintances, business associates, and employees. He and most of those interviewed seem to admire what she has achieved.  However, he and many of them also seem to deplore her values, attitudes, and (especially) her mistreatment of others. <br />Byron met Stewart in Westport (CT) and knew her only casually as a neighbor whom he encountered infrequently. At that time, he was advancing his career as a journalist, writing for the Wall Street Journal. He became intrigued by the rapid development of her own career and decided to write a book about her. Initially Stewart agreed to cooperate with him but later reconsidered. At no point in the narrative does Byron express any animosity toward her (or about anything else, for that matter) but many others do, notably Kathy Tatlock and Norma Collier. Along the way, Byron also examines Stewart as wife and mother. He observes: \\"As Martha's fame grew, and she became increasingly absorbed in making it grow still more, she seemed to have less and less time for her personal relationships -- not just with [husband] Andy and [daughter] Alexis, but with her employees, her neighbors, and anyone else she might encounter day to day. A brusque efficiency began to take over her conversations.\\" Eventually her husband left her and other personal relationships deteriorated further as she continued to pursue and achieve her various business objectives. Today, she owns Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. (How she regained control should guarantee her immediate induction into the \\"Business Hall of Fame.\\") She is among the wealthiest and most influential people (male or female) in the United States and, if consumer markets continue to expand in underdeveloped countries, it seems certain that both her wealth and her influence will increase exponentially. <br />Throughout his book, Byron shares lots of opinions and evaluations of Stewart (his and others') as he attempts to understand her character and personality, her life and career. He seems to try very hard to be circumspect. The Stewart who emerges by the end of the book reminds me of what Walt Whitman once said of himself: \\"Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself. I am large. I contain multitudes.\\" For whatever they may be worth, here are a few of my own reactions to the material in this page-turner of a book. First, I wonder how much criticism of Stewart there would be if she were a male. Is she held accountable to the same standards as, for example, Jack (\\"Neutron\\") Welch? Also, often mentioned in the same context as Oprah Winfrey, Stewart seems much more interested in lifestyle; Winfrey in quality of life. Big difference. Most people love Oprah; few seem to love Martha. How to explain that? Also, at a time when \\"branding\\" is an especially hot business topic, Stewart seems to be among the very few celebrities who IS the brand...rather than any merchandise (magazines, books, videos, television programs, etc.) associated with her. <br />Finally, I am intrigued by the number of high-powered male corporate executives who underestimated her, who (in Byron's word) made the mistake of \\"chick-ing\\" Stewart. How else to explain the fact that she was able to regain total control of a variety of media assets (e.g. Martha Stewart Living magazine and a series of spin-off books called \\"The Best of Martha Stewart Living\\") from Time Inc. in 1997 for $2 million out of her own pocket, about three days worth of the assets' revenue. She then created a new company (Martha Stewart Living Multimedia LLC), took it public in October 1999, and saw the company's stock price nearly triple during its first day of trading. That gave \\"the one-time Connecticut caterer a personal net worth of more than $1 billion.\\" Hers indeed is one of the most extraordinary business careers in American history, one which accelerates with increasing impact and profitability. As presented by Byron, Martha Stewart the businesswomen and Martha Stewart the person eventually became essentially the same person, and will continue to be the same person, for better or worse.	2002-04-24

Long ago, I concluded that most human wounds are self-inflicted. That has certainly been true of me and I think it is also true of Knight. He offers a highly visible example of someone who is \\"his own worst enemy.\\" Ironically, Knight has much of value to share but, for whatever reasons, he alienates those who would otherwise respect, perhaps even admire his ideas such as limiting Division One universities to only one scholarship in each major sport (e.g. football and basketball) for every \\"scholar/athlete\\" who earns a degree. For example, the number of scholarships Knight could award for the 2002-2003 basketball season would be determined by the number of Texas Tech basketball players who earned a degree during the 12 months prior to that season. (I really like that idea.) Knight has so much as said that Feinstein was a bleeping \\"traitor\\" because he quotes Knight constantly using profanity. There is none in this book. Rather, through 250-300 quotations, Carpenter and Towle trace Knight's career (and the evolution of his thinking) back to when he first became a head coach at the United States Military Academy. Those who are Knight advocates will find an abundance of material to support their high opinion of him. Those who view him with contempt must seek elsewhere for additional \\"evidence\\" of his misbehavior.	2002-04-22

In recent months, I have been centrally involved with cross-functional teams to simplify production process inorder to reduce cycle time while increasing first-pass yield. Almost immediately after we began our work, I realized that we had to simplify the process by which we were attempting to simplify process. I think this is what White has in mind: To generate new ideas, it is first necessary to generate new ideas about how to do that. Otherwise, the results will probably be the same. I have yet to encounter anyone who denies the importance of \\"creative\\" or \\"innovative\\" thinking. We all realize that Edisons are few and far between. However, as White and others have correctly pointed out, all of us can develop perspectives and then skills by which free ourselves from mindsets which preclude (and often denigrate) creative, innovative thinking. In Leading Change, mindsets which Jim O'Toole characterizes as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\"<br />Not a day goes by that I do not hear someone refer to \\"thinking outside the box.\\" My own experience has convinced me that (a) eventually it is necessary to get back in the \\"box\\" because that is where problems must be solved or (b) replace the \\"box\\" with another, one which is more appropriate to the given enterprise. In this volume, White shares her own experiences and insights (of course) but her primary focus is on a wide, deep, and varied selection of what the book's subtitle refers to as \\"the world's leading innovators.\\" Based on the evidence provided, they are indeed. In the Preface, White introduces her core concept of \\"hot, hip, and happening\\" (or \\"H3\\"): cutting-edge organizations and individuals to whom the book's subtitle refers. She interviewed more than 100 corporate executives. Following an especially thought-provoking Introduction (\\"Sizzling Spaces: Making Innovation Happen\\"), White organizes her material within seven chapters:<br />1. Spark Soup: Where Innovation Begins<br />2. Bubbling: New Approaches to Idea Development<br />3. Bargaining with the Future: The Valuation Struggle<br />4. Going Live: Bringing New Ideas to Life<br />5. Integrated Circuitry: Mechanisms of Innovative Action<br />6. Rocket Design: Innovating the Organization<br />7. Making an Apple Pie: Beyond the Organization<br />Don't be deterred by these chapter titles. (At first, I was. They seemed a tad cutesy-pie. I was wrong.) The titles are eminently appropriate to the material provided; also, as you will soon realize, they comprise a thematic narrative in precisely the correct sequence. Along the way, she includes dozens of especially apt quotations. My personal favorites include \\" If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\\" (Sir Isaac Newton), \\"You can't depend on your eyes when your mind is out of focus.\\" (Mark Twain), \\"Every blade of grass has its Angel that bends over it and whispers ''Grow, grow.'\\" (The Talmud), \\"Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative.\\" (Oscar Wilde), and \\"You must be the change you wish to see in the world.\\" (Mahatma Gandhi).

Over a total of 100 full rounds on a variety of courses, hitting from the white (middle) tees, using one mulligan a side but only from a tee, with \\"gimmes\\" inside the leather, and playing the ball down, I would probably average 85 strokes per round. I am probably too old (i.e. too set in my ways) to make and then sustain major changes in my set-up, grip, take-away, weight shift, follow-through, etc. So, although keenly interested in whatever Tiger Woods has to say about golf, I must admit at the outset that his observations and suggestions will probably have little impact on how I play UNLESS he invites me to play a round with him. Just the two of us, without distractions.<br />That said, I think this will be a terrific book for those who are about to take up golf (especially youngsters) or who have only recently done so. Also, to other golfers (regardless of age or gender) who are nowhere near as set in their ways as I am in mine. In terms of athletic ability, the gap between Woods and other elite players is much narrower (I think) than the gap between his mental discipline and theirs. It is incomprehensible to me, for example, that he would have made the same mental errors which Els and then Singh made during the final nine holes of the recent Masters tournament at Augusta National while they were still in contention. I vividly recall his mental discipline many years earlier while facing adversity during match play competition in the U.S. Amateur. How he plays \\"mental\\" golf will be of special interest to whose who are not especially athletic as well as to those (such as females or seniors) who may be at a physical disadvantage.<br />What I find most admirable about Woods is often ignored or given secondary importance by the media: His consummate sportsmanship. Although a ferocious competitor (albeit against the course and his own abilities), he always conducts himself as a gentleman, win or lose, with style and grace. I also wish to praise this book for the quality of its photography. First-rate. I thoroughly enjoyed the pleasure of Woods's company while reading this book and can easily accommodate an invitation to play a round with him sometime if he reads this review and is so inclined., with style and grace.

In fact, I have seen several of his recent appearances on television during which he frankly discussed that illness without anger, self-pity, or bitterness. In this volume, he shares his thoughts and feelings about his life thus far, devoting substantial attention to his current circumstances. The fact that he considers himself a \\"lucky man\\" expresses the same attitude which Lou Gehrig did decades ago when speaking to his teammates and fans in Yankee Stadium. How easy it is to think of an entertainer such as Fox wholly in terms of the various roles played throughout a career. More often than not, only at the time of death or perhaps only many years thereafter do we begin to \\"know\\" most entertainers as human beings. Some we then appreciate even more; others less. Fox looks back over his childhood and youth, his problems with alcohol and personal relationships, the challenges he encountered as he became a celebrity, and (for me) most important of all, the lessons he has learned along the way. This is essentially a positive memoir about a still young man (trapped in the body of an 80-year old) now facing a very serious situation. I commend him for discussing so generously and so eloquently what many of his readers (I included) would find difficult to share. As I completed reading this personal affirmation of certain basic values, I wished that Fox could have accompanied Mitch Albom during several of his Tuesday visits to see Morrie Schwartz. Those conversations never occurred but at least we have this book as well as Albom's...and because of that, we are also \\"lucky.\\"	2002-04-18

The others are The Directors: Take One and Directors Take Two: In Their Own Words. Emery's role was to pose the questions to which the directors responded and then edit transcripts of the given programs televised. Literally, the directors speak for themselves. That is to say, Emery (wisely, I think) eschews the standard Q &amp; A format. Some readers will be especially interested in specific directors; others will be more interested in specific films; still others (I among them) will be interested in both the directors and the films they directed. Predictably the quality of the material varies, sometimes significantly. For example, in this volume, I found the general observations by Gary Marshall and Rob Reiner much more informative than  those by John G. Avildsen and John McTierman. (Other readers may have an entirely different opinion. Fair enough.) The overall value of the book, however, is derived from having direct access to the thoughts and feelings of these directors and I regret that such access is not readily available -- in a single volume -- to so many other great directors (e.g. D.W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, Ernst Lubitsch, Cecil B. DeMille, John Ford, Federico Fellini, and Ingmar Bergman) except, perhaps in full-scale biographies, critical studies, and/or in correpondence.<br />Fortunately, however, Peter Bogdanovich has published an excellent collection of his interviews of 16 directors (e.g. Raoul Walsh, Fritz Lang, Howard Hawks, George Cukor, and Alfred Hitchcock). Also, Richard Schickel has published another collection of his interviews of great directors such as Frank Capra, Vincente Minnelli, and King Vidor as well as of Cukor, Hawks, and Walsh.<br />One of Emery's most effective devices in both \\"Directors\\" volumes is \\"The Conversation,\\" a section which introduces each director. It follows Emery's own brief but insightful introduction to \\"The Films of....\\"  I am also grateful to Emery for not intruding (as editor) on the flow of information provided in each chapter. Sure, several portions of the book's narrative could have been \\"tightened up\\" but, in that event, the book would have lost much of its unique flavor and, worse yet, its vitality and spontaneity. I think both \\"Directors\\" volumes are first-rate and highly recommend them as well as the previously mentioned collections by Bogdanovich and Schickel.follows Emery's own brief but insightful introduction to \\"The Films of....\\"  I am also grateful to Emery for not intruding (as editor) on the flow of information provided in each chapter.

They include \\"the story of [his] two separate entwined legacies of being English and being Jewish\\" during 1935-52 as well as the Battle of Britain when he and his mother were relocated from London to Sussex to avoid the Blitz, the gradual awareness of the Holocaust, and eventually the establishment of the State of Israel.<br />For me, one of Gross's most powerful qualities is his modesty (almost self-deprecation) as his memoir proceeds through such volatile times. For example, on the matter of anti-Semitism, he observes that \\"to have had a religious upbringing at least assures that in your own mind you are a Jew first, and the object of other people's dislike second.\\" Young Gross seems to have been spared the ordeal of what other Jews his age experienced during the Third Reich. With regard to his own faith, \\"for many Jews, whatever the larger historical balance sheet, anti-Semitism is the heart of the matter, the only significant reason why they still feel Jewish.\\" I was also deeply moved by his portrayal of his father, Avraham ben Oser, who became a doctor. The adult Gross very closely resembles that wise and generous man. It is not so much that father and son tolerate anti-Semitism; rather, that they absorb it and thereby deprive it of any legitimacy.<br />Frequently as I read this book, I wondered what their conversations would have discussed had young Andras Grof emigrated to London rather than to New York and become friends with young Gross. (Grof changed his name to Grove and later served as CEO of Intel Corporation. I highly recommend his own memoir, Swimming Across.) The balance of Gross's engaging and eloquent autobiography reveals his thoughts and feelings about the Cold War years during which Stalin executed so many Jewish artists and writers. He also comments insightfully on T.S. Eliot (\\"who may be a great poet but he isn't greater than the Jewish people\\") and W.H. Auden whose social values are more compatible with Gross's own. There is great sensitivity in this book but almost no sentimentalism. Were a higher rating available, I would gratefully give it to this unique and compelling personal narrative.also comments insightfully on T.S.

I forget when or where but, many years ago, I first learned about a chess-playing automaton in the 19th century. In Standage's just published book, I have just learned \\"the rest of the story.\\" The automaton (named \\"The Turk\\") attracted a great deal of attention and generated a great deal of controversy. Benjamin Franklin apparently played a game or two against it. In fact, \\"The Turk\\" is reputed to have defeated most of Europe's chess masters during a period which extends from 1770 until 1855. It attracted the attention of countless celebrities (e.g. Napoleon Bonaparte, Edgar Allan Poe, Catherine the Great, and Charles Babbage) and indeed, \\"The Turk\\" itself became a celebrity as did its inventor, Wolfgang von Kempelen. Was it truly a technological marvel, not only able to to move chess pieces but to formulate and then follow strategies which prevailed against most of the most skilled players? Or was it a hoax? It would be a disservice both to Standage and to his reader to say much more about this book, except that it is exceptionally well-written and combines the best features of a crackerjack detective story with the skills required of a world-class cultural anthropologist.

The others are The Directors: Take Two and Directors Take Two: In Their Own Words. Emery's role was to posed the questions to which the directors responded and then edit transcripts of the given programs televised. Literally, the directors speak for themselves. That is to say, Emery (wisely, I think) eschews the standard Q &amp; A format. Some readers will be especially interested in specific directors; others will be more interested in specific films; still others (I among them) will be interested in both the directors and their films. Predictably the quality of the various directors' responses varies, sometimes significantly. For example, in this volume, for whatever reasons, Spike Lee's and Lawrence Kasdan's comments on their individual films are far more insightful than are those of Robert Wise and Sydney Pollack. However, because Emery also poses several specific subjects to which directors are asked to respond (e.g. \\"Why [Wise] Decided to Produce His Own Films\\" and \\"How Does [Pollack] Choose His Projects?\\"), Wise and Pollack are able to share with the reader perspectives and opinions that are probably otherwise unavailable. I was especially pleased to learn that Richard Donner considers Inside Moves (1908) \\"one of my greatest, dearest films.\\" Featuring John Savage, David Morse, Diana Scarwid, and Amy Wright among an ensemble cast, this film is one I include on my own list of the very best which few people have seen or even know of. One of Emery's most effective devices is \\"The Conversation,\\" a section which introduces each director in his own words. I am grateful to Emery for not intruding (as editor) on the flow of information provided in each chapter. Sure, several portions of the book's narrative could have been \\"tightened up\\" but, in that event, I think the book would have lost much of its flavor and, worse yet, its vitality and spontaneity.vor and, worse yet, its vitality and spontaneity.	2002-04-11

Perhaps you have already read Hall's previous book, Jump Start Your Brain (1996) to which David Wecker was a contributor. Most of the core concepts introduced in that book are developed in much greater depth in this sequel. However, Hall makes a much greater effort to explain their direct relevance to achieving business success. He shares \\"good news\\" in the Introduction: \\"Business success is not random. There are patterns in the universe of business. There are reproducible scientific lessons and laws that, when applied with diligence, can help you win more, lose less, and make more money with your new products, services, sales, and advertising efforts.\\" Contrary to Darwinists, Hall rejects the term survival, replacing it with \\"thriving\\" through the effective use of data-validated scientific laws. Although he states that small business owners are the \\"focal point\\" of his book, I believe that literally anyone can benefit from this book who needs to formulate better ideas within a competitive marketplace.<br />These new ideas need not be limited to \\"new products, services, sales, and advertising efforts.\\" On the contrary, they could also help substantially to improve the cycle time and first-pass yield of a process to produce new products and services, to increase both sales and profits, and to maximize the impact of marketing (i.e. creating demand for) whatever is offered for sale. In addition, effective application of \\"reproducible scientific lessons and laws\\" can generate new ideas which help a company to strengthen its relationships with customers, vendors, and strategic allies as well as with its own employees or \\"associates,\\" as they are called at companies such as Wal-Mart and JCPenney.<br />Hall introduces and then explains what he calls \\"The Three Laws of Marketing Physics\\" in Part I (Overt Benefit, Real Reason to Believe, and Dramatic Difference) in Part II and then what he calls \\"The Three Laws of Capitalist Creativity\\" in Part II(Explore Stimuli, Leverage Diversity, and Face Fears). If I understand Hall correctly (and I may not in some instances), he works with a rather inclusive definition of \\"scientific\\" which bears greater resemblance to the thought processes of a Benjamin Franklin and Eli Whitney than those of, lets say, Frederick W. Taylor and W. Edwards Deming. Moreover, writing with what I characterize as a \\"Batman Style\\" (i.e. Pow! Bam! Gadzooks!), he seems to attach much greater value to enthusiasm, indeed PASSION! than he does to highly structured deductive and inductive reasoning. Hall asserts that ideas \\"are the only true fuel for winning customers and growing profits.\\" How they are generated is determined by both attitude and process. With regard to scientific laws (however derived), they \\"provide a foundation for making decisions and taking action in the face of chaos.\\"<br />Throughout this book, Hall includes all manner of exercises by which to \\"jump start\\" a brain. (FYI, each brain has about 12-trillion cells and is capable of 10,000 connections -- neurons forming synapses -- with other cells. To jump start is to expedite as well as increase such connections.) In Chapter 10, \\"How to Fuel Your Brain for Maximum Productivity,\\" Hall includes several \\"Practical Tactics\\" such as those which can help anyone to break \\"mental constipation,\\" \\"walk the talk,\\" and complete a \\"mind dump.\\" The extent to which a brain can make connections is determined almost entirely by the quantity and quality of what is available to connect. Hall recommends various specific strategies and tactics by which to increase, constantly, the number of one's \\"connectibles.\\"<br />Near the end of many of my reviews, I ask \\"For whom will this book be most valuable?\\" With regard to this book, that is an easy answer to provide: Anyone who has a brain and wants to make much more effective use of it.<br />If your primary interest is in increasing \\"creativity\\" and \\"innovation\\" within primarily a business context, I highly recommend this book as well as Lynne C. Levesque's Breakthrough Creativity: Achieving Top Performance Using the Eight Creative Talents, Joey Reiman's Thinking for a Living: Creating Ideas That revitalize Your Business, Career, and Life, Stephen M. Shapiro's 24/7 Innovation: A Blueprint for Surviving and Thriving in an Age of Innovation, and Roger Von Oech's Expected the Unexpected (Or You Won't Find It): A Creativity Tool Based on the Ancient Wisdom of Heraclitus. If I were to buy only one of these books, Hall's would be my choice.<br />If your interest is more general in nature, check out Bernie DeKoven's The Well-Played Game: A Playful Path to Wholeness, Guy Claxton's Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind: How Intelligence Increases When You Think Less, Michael Michalko's Cracking Creativity: The Secrets of Creative Genius, and Roger Von Oech's A Kick in the Seat of the Pants: Using Your Explorer, Artist, Judge, and Warrior to Be More Creative and A Whack on the Side of the Head: How You Can Be More Creative.as well as Lynne C.

Its ultimate origins lie in a game called rounders, played by village boys in England since time immemorial. Variations of rounders were known in both England and America by many other names, and one called baseball is even mentioned by Jane Austen in Northanger Abbey, written about 1798.\\" Dawidoff has edited a literary anthology which, in my opinion, is the best single collection of writing about baseball as has yet been published. Even for long-time, passionate fans such as I, the fact many of the authors represented are unfamiliar adds even greater value to Dawidoff's 721-page anthology. That is to say, there are adventures of discovery in this superb collection...discoveries of voices perhaps not heard before as well as discoveries of situations previously unknown to most of us.<br />Appropriately, the first selection is Thayer's \\"Casey at the Bat.\\" I never weary of reading it or of hearing someone recite it. Corny? Of course. I hasten to add,  Dawidoff also includes brilliant commentaries by those sports journalists most closely identified with baseball (e.g. Runyon, Lardner, Rice, Smith, Gallico, and Angell) as well as Satchell Paige's delightful selection, \\"Rules for Staying Young.\\" As I think about this book, the word \\"feast\\" comes to mind; also the word \\"buffet.\\" The authors offer a wide and deep combination of perspectives on what remains our national pastime. Although I am appalled by so much which is apparently essential to Major League Baseball today (especially greed and the inevitable victim of it, loyalty), I have not as yet lost my faith in the game's essential integrity. I still get goose bumps when I emerge from a walkway and first see the lush green field.  Later, the crack of a bat, the roar of a crowd in response. Hot dogs, cold beer, popcorn and peanuts (if not Cracker Jack). The uniquely thrilling excitement of an inside-the-park home run, a triple play, a steal of home. Years ago, a graduate school professor of mine suggested that a myth is something that never was and always will be. That is my view of baseball in its purest forms, a view encouraged by this remarkable book.The uniquely thrilling excitement of an inside-the-park home run, a triple play, a steal of home.

But that's not the best way to use it. Rather, first, re-examine all of your thoughts and feelings about accounts receivable (AR). (Do you even know precisely who owes you how much and for how long?) Then rigorously evaluate your current policies and procedures (if you have any) and make whatever modifications are necessary, guided and informed by what the Shers suggest. Finally, consistently follow those policies and procedures while being willing to consider a specific AR problem within its context. I wholeheartedly agree with the Shers that (a) AR may well be the single most important component of customer relationships, (b) AR problems offer unique opportunities to strengthen relationships with those customers involved, and (c) most AR problems are avoidable, more often than not the result of a misunderstanding rather than a customer's intention to avoid any payment whatsoever.<br />The Shers organize their excellent material within three Sections (Attitude, Speed, and Knowledge), following an Introduction which -- all by itself -- is worth much more than the cost of the book. They then share \\"A Few Final Words\\" about avoiding bad debts, consumer collections (why some don't pay) and what they call \\"The Kitchen Basket Syndrome,\\" commercial collections, and finally, \\"Lessons in Real Life.\\" Almost all companies have AR problems because some of their customers have cash flow problems.<br />What we have here is a step-by-step, cohesive and comprehensive system to minimize, expedite, and resolve problems with accounts receivable. Assume good will on the part of most customers and make every effort to \\"work with them.\\" However, also know that at least a few are disreputable and be prepared to outsource some ARs to an attorney or collection agency. (The Shers explain the most effective way to do that.) For me, one of this book's greatest values is its emphasis on seeing AR within any organization's entire operations. In certain respects, this is a \\"How to Do It\\" book but it is more, much more. The Shers strike me as being psychologists rather than bill collectors, as being two decent people who believe that most other people are also decent, and who sincerely want to help their readers to obtain what is due them without compromising the integrity of those who are in their debt. The Shers' advice is eminently practical; it is also highly principled.emphasis on seeing AR within any organization's entire operations.

On the contrary, he views them as having resulted in a cultural \\"catastrophe.\\" In the Preface, he recalls a professor of his at Dartmouth, Eugene Rosenstock-Huessy, who once asserted that \\"the goal of education is the citizen. He defined the citizen in a radical and original way arising out of his own twentieth-century experience. He said that a citizen is a person who, if need be, can re-create his civilization.\\" This is one of Hart's core concepts throughout the book. For him, the most central of narratives to explain history, \\"one which goes furthest, I think, in covering the facts, has been called 'Athens and Jerusalem.'\\" The former represents a philosophic-scientific approach to actuality, with the goal being cognition; the latter represents a scriptural tradition of disciplined insight and the aspiration to holiness.<br />Hart was motivated to write this book because, as he explains, \\"....I sense that out across our nation, the dark fields of the republic as Nick Carraway called it, a growing number of students and professors long for something more serious and more lasting. Therefore my title [was selected] because of the intellectual force and civilizing energy of the indispensable works to be considered.\\" He organizes his material within two Parts: \\"The Great Narrative\\" (focusing on the juxtaposition of \\"Athens and Jerusalem,\\" Moses, Socrates, Jesus, and Paul) and \\"Explorations\\" (focusing on Augustine, Dante, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Moliere, Voltaire, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Hart's primary objective in this book, as I see it, is to suggest how a rigorous consideration of what he calls the \\"Athens and Jerusalem\\" narrative can help to revive higher education from \\"the dark fields\\" in which it now finds itself.<br />At this point, I'd like to share a few concerns of my own within the context of discussing Hart's book. First, according to substantial research, approximately 35% of public high school graduates are functional illiterates; the percentage is even higher among those who attempt to enlist in one of the military services. Second, other research studies indicate that approximately 90% of those now teaching in public schools will continue to do so through the year 2015. Finally, at least one research study of public schools in California suggests that only 35% of each hour in a classroom is devoted to completing an academic task of some kind. If these statistics are to be believed, even allowing for some variances of percentage, the \\"catastrophe\\" to which Hart refers has implications far beyond higher education.<br />As indicated earlier, I share many of his concerns. Having taught for thirteen years in two New England boarding schools (Kent and St. George's) after earning a graduate degree in comparative literature at Yale and, more recently, being involved with the Aspen Institute's Executive Seminars, I also share Hart's passion for \\"The Great Narrative\\" and lament its widespread neglect in undergraduate liberal arts education. Many other readers will also share Hart's concerns but disagree with his proposed responses to the causes of those concerns. It remains for each reader to determine whether or not Hart's analysis is valid Also, to determine if it would be desirable to re-establish the \\"Athens and Jerusalem\\" narrative, \\"The Great Narrative,\\" as a core curriculum, at least in four-year colleges and universities. True to the spirit of Western Civilization, Hart raises only the most important questions. Man's efforts to answer them continues. Meanwhile, Pilgrims are well-advised to remember Voltaire's admonition: \\"Cherish those who seek the truth but beware of those who find it.\\"cussing Hart's book.

With brevity but precision and insight, they examine 30 people who have indeed \\"shaped modern business.\\" The excellent material is presented within 12 chapters which range from \\"Inventors\\" (Eli Whitney and Thomas Alva Edison) to \\"Guru\\" (peter F. Drucker).. Along the way, they discuss a number of especially influential persons about whom many readers probably know little (if anything), such as Alexander T. Stewart, James J. Hill, Ezra Cornell, Lillian and Frank Gilbreth, Chester I. Barnard, and Mary Parker Follett.<br />All by itself, the Introduction is well worth the cost of the book. Near its conclusion, Wren and Greenwood observe: \\"Taken as a whole, there is no single theme to this book; rather, it is a narrative with multiple themes as a story of American business enterprise unfolds. Beginning with the selection of inventors, we see how the process of invention and innovation changes the way we live, creates entirely new industries, and must be continuous as the competitive environment changes. Makers [e.g. Henry Ford] are those who who change ideas into markets for the marketplace -- an evolutionary process that accompanies the shift from small-to-large-scale manufacturing and then to the assembly line. Sellers [e.g. Richard W. Sears] take those products to market and allow us to see the sales and distribution innovations that have enabled modern consumers to live better than the monarchs of centuries before. Inventors, makers, and sellers need the movers [e.g. Edward H. Harriman], those who create the time and place utility; and all need the communicators [e.g. Alexander Graham Bell], who connect the parts into a whole.\\"<br />Because this book was first published in 1998, many readers (I among them) would have expected the inclusion of other \\"management innovators\\" such as Donald Dell, Walt Disney, Bill Gates, Sam Walton, and Jack Welch. Perhaps they will be among those discussed in a sequel to this volume. Nonetheless, each of the 30 whom Wren and Greenwood do include is eminently worthy. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Stuart Crainer's The Management Century, James Tobin's Great Projects: The Epic Story of the Building of America, from the Taming of the Mississippi to the Invention of the Internet, and Andrea Gabor's The Capitalist Philosophers:  The Geniuses of Modern Business -- Their Lives, Times, and Ideas.iscussed in a sequel to this volume.

Cheng's is NOT a \\"How to Do It\\" book but it does provide a head-snapping alert on subjects which Reiser and DiColo discuss in greater depth and with meticulous care.<br />In this volume, Reiser and DiColo provide a cohesive and comprehensive guide to investment strategies for retirement and estate planner for two primary categories of readers: \\"First are serious investors with at least $100,000 to invest, who want to plan for their own and their families' futures by taking advantage of the best financial counsel and service available....Second are financial service professionals -- accountants, lawyers, insurance agents and others to whom people turn for investment, tax, and estate planning advice.\\" My own opinion is that this same volume could also be of substantial benefit to others who have only recently begun a career and anticipate earning progressively greater income in years to come. I concede that much of Reiser and DiColo recommend may not be of immediate value to them but it should be of interest. It is never too soon to anticipate and then prepare to make wise financial decisions. Career choices will obviously have a major impact on the context within such decisions are made.<br />Reiser and DiColo organize their excellent material within three Parts: Defining Wealth, Achieving Wealth, and Preserving Wealth. They focus on 31 different \\"wealth stories\\" (see page xii), all based on real-world circumstances but, for obvious reasons, the names of those involved have been changed. Along the way, Reiser and DiColo include and explain each of what they call \\"Pitfalls.\\" Each in fact is an incorrect assumption. For example, Don't Save During Prime Earning Years\\" (#1) and \\"Invest for Immediate Income\\" (#6). They then provide seven appendices, ranging from \\"Your Financial Physical: Investment to Take to prospective Financial Advisors\\" to \\"Markets in Crisis.\\" They offer what they call 5 Tips to Become Wealthy\\":<br />1. Begin with a Good Attitude and Positive Approach  (i.e. define what \\"wealth means to you)<br />2. Take Charge (i.e. appoint yourself CEO of \\"You, Inc.\\").<br />3. Have Courage (i.e. hire a COO such as a tax attorney or financial planner to manage the day to day operations)<br />4. Be Smart (i.e. develop a plan and strategy including risk/reward objectives, proper asset allocation, take maximum advantage of tax strategies including those provided by the Economic Tax Act of 2001)<br />5. Be Disciplined (i.e. stick to your plan while collaborating with your \\"COO\\" on whatever necessary and appropriate changes may need to be made)<br />Given both the negative and positive the potential implications and consequences of major financial decisions, including the selection of an appropriate source of professional advice, I strongly recommend that those who read this book take very seriously the completion of various exercises which Reiser and DiColo provide. Why? There are several reasons. For me, the two most important are that (1) you need to understand the precise nature and extent of your current resources and (2) the \\"homework\\" you complete will expedite the decision-making process in consultation with whomever you select as your financial advisor. One very important point: If you do not now have a will or if the will you have is not current with all applicable federal and state tax code provisions, have one prepared for you immediately to cover at least the main issues. This is especially important of you are married and even more important if you and your spouse reside in a community property state.<br />One final suggestion: Carefully read  at least one other \\"guide\\" to achieving, preserving, and protecting financial resources. My strong recommendation is Suze Orman's The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom. She takes a somewhat different approach to many of the same subjects which Reiser and DiColo discuss in this volume. Nonetheless, you need to consider all sensible options. Meanwhile, keep clearly in mind what former president of Harvard University Derek Bok once said in response to irate parents who complained of a tuition increase: \\"If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.\\"e married and even more important if you and your spouse reside in a community property state. <br />One final suggestion: Carefully read  at least one other \\"guide\\" to achieving, preserving, and protecting financial resources.

Once again, as was the situation when I began to read a few other books recently, I had no idea what to expect. The title intrigued me. Also, I was curious to learn how I could find \\"financial wisdom in everyday eating.\\" Having now read Cheng's book, I recommend it highly to anyone who fits in any one of the following categories:<br />1. Those who have no financial plan<br />2. Those who do not understand compound interest<br />3. Those who are unwilling and/or unable to save money on a consistent basis<br />4. Those who are unwilling and/or unable to live within their means<br />5. Those who have become hostage to credit card debt<br />6. Those who do not take full advantage of a 401 (k) account<br />7.

Those who are about to begin a divorce process<br />What we have here is a short book which is long on potential value, presented as a series of conversations by the narrator (\\"Skye\\") with fictional persons, based on the author's extensive experience with real people who fit in one or more of the ten aforementioned categories. Moreover, Cheng invokes a series of food metaphors and analogies to illustrate basic principles of \\"financial wisdom.\\" She also includes a series of recipes but a reader need have little (if any) interest in food preparation and still find this book entertaining as well as informative. It is NOT a \\"how to do it\\" manual on wealth accumulation nor on financial or estate planning. I would characterize it as a series of skillfully presented \\"heads up.\\"<br />After reading this book, many will need to seek professional assistance (e.g. writing or re-writing an appropriate will) after checking out other sources for information and counsel which Cheng does not provide in her book.

Thus each can be viewed as a modern-day emperor. In that sense, they are (at least for now) among the \\"royalty\\" of the contemporary business world. Frankly, I find them much more interesting as ordinary human beings in most respects but who do indeed possess a few extraordinary talents which help to explain why each has achieved so much thus far.<br />Leibovich organizes her excellent material  with five chapters, each dedicated to one of the \\"new imperialists.\\" Having just read Florence Stone's The Oracle of Oracle: The Story of Volatile CEO Larry Ellison and the Strategies Behind His Company's Phenomenal Success, I was already well-prepared for the first chapter. Stone's comments about Ellison are remarkably;y consistent with Leibovich's, both agreeing that Ellison is one of the most complicated, sometimes contradictory, and on occasion infuriating people they have as yet encountered. Consider Leibovich's account of a conversation with Adda Quinn, to whom Ellison was once married, years before the founding of Oracle: \\"Quinn calls Ellison the most charming, brilliant, and non-boring man she has ever known. He also gave her an ulcer, she says, with his deceptions, darting interests, and changing moods....He had an explosive temper and Quinn  said she feared for her safety as their marriage was ending. The couple kept guns in the house -- they lived in a rough part of Oakland and had been burglarize -- and she thought that Ellison was becoming increasingly erratic.\\"  There are many other similar comments by whose who had direct and frequent contact with Ellison. Obviously, Ellison is an exceptionally intelligent man but also \\"volatile\\" and, when it serves his purposes ruthless.<br />The chapter which interested me the most is the one devoted to John Chambers. He and the other four \\"achieved their dominance seemingly overnight. and to a degree that has exploded any previous notion of commercial scope and scale. Moreover their wired age goals go beyond mere geographic expansion; they incorporate a kind of lifestyle imperialism in which traditional lines of media and commerce are constantly being pushed.\\" However, to a much greater extent than any of the others, Chambers has helped Cisco Systems to achieve its dominance through aggressive M&amp;A initiatives and strategic partnerships. His preferred approach is collegial rather than confrontational. I also find it significant that Chambers' personality and leadership style are far less flamboyant than those of Ellison, Bezos, and Case. Also, based on the information provided, he conducts himself in a manner which suggests that he is much less competitive than Gates. However, it is important to remember that this may well be a skillfully cultivated perception rather than a reality.<br />What we have here are mini-biographies, albeit more substantial than \\"portraits,\\" of five uncommon men, all of whom are distinguished by \\"their quest for social ubiquity, a sense of manifest destiny that is captured in America Online's corporate mantra, `AOL Anywhere.'

Bushe does offer a somewhat different nomenclature but affirms essentially the same core concepts which countless others (e.g. Warren Bennis, James O'Toole, John Kotter, Peter Senge, and William Isaacson) have already introduced or refined. However, in fairness to Bushe, he has done an excellent job of organizing and presenting his material. His book will probably be of greatest value to those who have done relatively little reading on the subject.<br />According to Bushe, Clear Leadership is based on four deep skills: \\"those of the Aware self, the Descriptive self, the Curious self, and the Appreciative self.\\" In the Introduction, he goes on to observe that \\"these skills are easy to explain and demonstrate but tough to actually live day to day and master....Most of us don't act this way. Not because we lack the courage, caring, or basic personal integrity, but because we don't know how! No one ever taught us.\\" His objective is to \\"teach\\" the reader a \\"system of interaction \\" which is based on specific \\"interpersonal dynamics.\\" Bushe organizes his material within ten chapters divided into three Parts: Clarity and Mush in Organizational Life, The Four Selves of Clear Leaders, and Clear Leadership at Work. His sources are acknowledged within the chapter Endnotes.<br />There is much to be said in favor of clarity in terms of shared goals and objectives, performance expectations, division of labor, channels of authority and communication, etc. Obviously, the effectiveness of any \\"system\\" of human interaction depends on it. Moreover, leadership is essential to ensuring that clarity is maintained throughout any collaborative effort. Bushe offers some useful insights into what he characterizes as \\"new skills and attributes\\" that are required of everyone involved in an \\"empowered\\" organization, whatever its size or nature. He invites his reader to consider very carefully a \\"basic, underlying platform, the absolutely essential and different ingredients that make a person able to use the usual assortment of management techniques and get outstanding results.\\" Those in need of other perspectives are urged to check out the works of authors cited previously (Bennis, O'Toole, Kotter, and Isaacson) as well as David Maister's Practice What You Preach and Bossidy and Charan's Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done.any collaborative effort.

This is a key point, one which Bossidy and Charan emphasize in their recently published book, Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done. It is important to keep in mind that any \\"blueprint\\" provided in a book such as this must almost always be modified to serve the specific needs and objectives of a given organization. This is precisely what Shapiro has in mind when, in the Introduction, observes  &quot;in some respects writing a book that describes best practices for innovation that says that best practices are insufficient is slightly ironic.  But to try and copy what another company is doing, lock stock and barrel, is just another form of box thinking.  Instead, connect the dots.  Make connections.  Consider what some companies in this book have been doing and consider them in the context of your own business situation. And then try and use these to create new ideas for fostering innovation.&quot; Hammer wrote The Agenda to disabuse those who view reengineering as a \\"silver bullet.\\" I'm certain that Shapiro hopes his readers will view the \\"blueprint\\" delineated in Part 1 of 24/7 Innovation for what it is while understanding what it is not...and cannot be expected to do. Change is inevitable.<br />Long ago, someone divided people into three categories: Those who make it happen, those who watch it happen, and those who ask \\"What happened?\\" Shapiro views desirable change as as fundamental and pervasive. \\"It affects customers, suppliers, alliance partners, and anyone who touches [or is touched by] the company. But in today's age of change, success requires nothing less. That's why 24/7 innovation is the only way to achieve a unique and enduring competitive advantage.\\" One of the words now having the loudest buzz is \\"convergence.\\" (Not long ago, two of the loudest buzzers were \\"synergies\\" and \\"integration.\\") As Shapiro clearly demonstrates while examining four companies (GlaxoSmithKline, Invensys, The Real Estate Assessment Center of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and BC Hydro) in Appendix A, the most effective organizations are indeed those which achieve and then sustain an appropriate convergence of process, people, and technology. That is, they become and then remain what Shapiro describes as an \\"organic organization.\\" In his book, he offers all manner of strategies and tactics as well as real-world examples to suggest HOW any organization (regardless of size or nature) can use the principles of  \\"24/7 Innovation\\" to achieve that formidable objective.ing the loudest buzz is \\"convergence.\\" (Not long ago, two of the loudest buzzers were \\"synergies\\" and \\"integration.\\") As Shapiro clearly demonstrates while examining four companies (GlaxoSmithKline, Invensys, The Real Estate Assessment Center of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and BC Hydro) in Appendix A, the most effective organizations are indeed those which achieve and then sustain an appropriate convergence of process, people, and technology.

Books	5	10	11	N	N	Challenging and Thought-Provoking Reflections	At the outset, I must acknowledge that this proved to be one of the most challenging books I have read in recent years. (You can thus understand why it was also among the most thought-provoking books I have read in recent years.) The subtitle informed me that Friedman would explain \\"what economics has to do with law and why it matters.\\" In the Introduction, he observes:<br />\\"The legal rules that we are most familiar with are laws created by legislatures and enforced by courts and police. But even in our society much of the law is the creation of not of legislatures but of judges, embedded in past precedences that determine how future cases will be decided; much enforcement of the law is by private parties such as tort victims and their lawyers rather than by police; and substantial bodies of legal rules take the form, not the laws, but of private norms, privately enforced.\\"<br />Friedman helps his reader to \\"understand various systems of legal rules by asking what consequences they will produce in a world in which rational individuals adjust their actions to the legal rules they face.\\" He cites two possible objectives of the economic approach to achieve such understanding the logic of law: the law may have no logic to understand or the law does have a logic \\"but that it is, or at least ought to be, concerned not with economic efficiency but with justice.\\" These are indeed critically important issues. How to address them? Friedman does so with an economic analysis of the law in terms of both economic ideas and areas of the law. First, he examines basic economic concepts (e.g.) \\"that can be used to to understand a wide range of legal issues. Then he shifts his attention to various questions raised what that examination reveals. For example: Why do other legal systems differ so much from ours? Why have two legal systems -- tort law and criminal law -- which \\"do roughly the same thing [but] in different ways?\\" Why not eliminate one of them? What arguments can be made to support or oppose the view that \\"judge-made law\\" is economically efficient? In the final chapter, he summarizes \\"what we have learned about systems of legal rules\\" throughout his extended analysis of the interaction of law with economics.<br />If I correctly understand what Friedman has shared throughout the book (and I may well do not), his ultimate objective is to create what is (in effect) a rough draft of what in final form would be a much more efficient legal system. Such a system would presumably increase the efficiency of other domestic systems (e..g. political and economic) as well as, in all probability, the efficiency of those systems' interaction with counterparts in other countries. For me at least, this was not an easy book to read, in part because I lack any formal education in either law or economics but also because of the inherent difficulty of drawing correlations and suggesting cause-and-effect relationships between two such complex human enterprises...o support or oppose the view that \\"judge-made law\\" is economically efficient?

They offer direct and relatively inexpensive access to cutting-edge thinking on a major business subject. This volume provides eight essays, each preceded by an \\"Executive Summary.\\" The first selection \\"What Makes a Leader?\\") was written by Daniel Goleman, author of Emotional Intelligence, Working with Emotional Intelligence, and the most recently published Primal Leadership.  After years of wide and deep experience with all manner of executives, Goleman has found that \\"the most effective leaders are alike in one crucial way: they all have a high degree of what has come to be known as emotional intelligence [which Goleman asserts] is the sine qua non of leadership.\\" He then identifies and briefly discusses what he calls \\"The Five Components of Emotional Intelligence at Work\\": Self-Awareness. Self-Regulation, motivation, empathy, and Social Skill.\\" These are the titles and authors of the other seven essays:<br />\\"Narcissistic Leaders: The Incredible Pros, the Inevitable Cons&quot; (Michael Maccoby)<br />\\"Leadership That Gets Results\\" (Goleman)<br />NOTE: Those especially interested in this subject are urged to check out Bossidy and Charan's Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done (June 2002).<br />\\"Getting the Attention You Need&quot; (Thomas H.

Frankly, I found very little thinking in Robert's book which I would characterize as \\"cutting edge\\" or \\"innovative.\\" However, all of his ideas are rock-solid, time-tested, and of direct relevance at a time when change (indeed volatility) is the only constant in the competitive marketplace. He carefully organizes his material within 14 chapters whose titles range from \\"Strategic Supremacy: Not a Dirty Word\\" to \\"CEOs Speak Their Minds on the Value of Strategic Supremacy.\\" The Strategic Thinking process which Robert first introduced in 1980 remains essentially the same when examined in this book. It involves concepts such as \\"a singular Driving Force,\\" \\"Areas of Excellence,\\" and \\"Strategic Leveraging.\\" Throughout his book, Robert explains why \\"significant shifts in market share occur, not by imitating a competitor's strategy, but by developing a strategy that changes the rules of play.\\" In this volume, with meticulous care, Robert explains HOW. I think this book will be especially helpful to decision-makers in smaller organizations which tend to have severely limited resources. In recent years, several people have suggested that the business strategy has been replaced by the business model. My own opinion is that they are not mutually exclusive; on the contrary, they are interdependent. Those in need of formulating a business model will find that several of Robert's core concepts can assist that effort.	2002-04-04

Whatever the role, he always seemed to me to be so self-assured, at times arrogant. Almost never encumbered by self-doubt. \\"Larger than life\\" in terms of his appetites. Obsessed with learning as much as he could about as many different subjects as he could and then leveraging his knowledge to gain advantage over others. But also tender, vulnerable, loving, gentle, sensitive, and compassionate. Even in his later years in films such as Atlantic City and Field of Dreams, Lancaster and the characters he played seem inseparable. By then, on and off the screen, age had obviously taken its toll but even so, there was always that sense of dignity, of personal pride, a twinkle in the eye. For me, Lancaster's personality and character are most evident in one of his least appreciated films, The Leopard. However, the same can also be said of the roles he plays in The Sweet Smell of Success, From Here to Eternity, Elmer Gantry, and Come Back, Little Sheba.  Kate Buford's biography provides about as much information about Lancaster's life and career as I care to know. The man she reveals could well have said of himself what Whitman expresses in \\"Song of Myself\\": Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself. I am large.

Much of his book focuses on what is now known as the &quot;Avery Dennison/Four Pillars Spy Case.\\" In recent years,  we have learned about  spies and counterspies such as Aldrich Ames and Robert Philip Hanssen. Many of us remain interested in others such as those known as \\"the Cambridge Spies\\" of whom Anthony Blunt was one. (The others were Guy Burgess, John Cairncross, Donald MacLean, and Kim Philby.) Even today, it is impossible to determine the nature and extent of all the damage they did to the British and American intelligence communities during and then following World War II . This is both a biography of Blunt (1907-1983) and an analysis of the society in which he was raised, educated, and then employed. He eventually became a highly regarded art historian while continuing his activities as a double agent. Blunt began to provide highly classified documents to the Russians in 1941; was discovered and then granted immunity (in 1964) in exchange for what was believed to be full disclosure of his activities and associates; and then was publicly denounced by Prime Minister Thatcher in 1979.<br />Given the information available to her at the time she wrote this book, Miranda Carter has provided about as comprehensive an examination of Blunt's several \\"lives\\" as can possibly be reconstructed. I must assume that her two greatest obstacles were, first, the necessarily secretive, indeed defensive nature of the global intelligence community (even after the demise of the U.S.S.R.) and second, the extraordinarily detached personality of Blunt himself. With consummate skill, he devised and sustained so many different \\"lives\\" which resemble, for me, a series of \\"bulkheads.\\" Gaining entry to any one of them (much less to all of them) would have required exceptional patience as well as persistence. It is to Carter's great credit that she was able to gather, evaluate, and correlate so much information and then present it eloquently in a narrative worthy of Dickens. Those who enjoyed reading this book as much as I did may wish to check out Christopher Andrew's For the President's Eyes Only: Secret Intelligence and the American Presidency from Washington to Bush, Christopher Felix' A Short Course in the Secret War, and Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones's The CIA and American Democracy.ch resemble, for me, a series of \\"bulkheads.\\" Gaining entry to any one of them (much less to all of them) would have required exceptional patience as well as persistence.

At a time when global initiatives continue to increase and expand as well as accelerate, it is especially significant that Loudon does not limit himself to national perspectives (such as those from the USA) which tend to exclude or subordinate all others. He carefully organizes his material within seven chapters, following an Introduction in which he observes: \\"There seem to be three strategies currently pursued by large companies. First, some are trying to enter webs of innovation by starting a separate -- often competitive division [e.g. Procter &amp; Gamble and Wal-Mart]....The second strategy is mergers and acquisitions [e.g. Healtheon merged with WebMD and Ahold acquired Peapod]....The third way is venture capital.\\" Loudon goes on to acknowledge that each of the three approaches can work \\"but it is critical to know which suits your company. This book will tell you.\\" And it does.<br />These brief remarks correctly suggest that Loudon's book will be of greatest value to decision-makers in larger organizations; however, it can also be of substantial value to those who do business with those organizations (especially on an outsource basis) or who provide professional services to them such as financial and legal. Change remains the only constant in the contemporary marketplace. This is especially true of the technical environment within which webs of innovation are established and developed.  Years ago, former president of Harvard University Derek Bok suggested that \\"If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.\\" This is especially true of organizations (including the larger non-profits) now struggling to leverage their assets in the online world.<br />At some point during his tenure as CEO of GE, Jack Welch explained why he admires small, entrepreneurial companies:<br />\\"For one, they communicate better. Without the din and prattle of bureaucracy, people listen as well as talk; and since there are fewer of them they generally know and understand each other. Second, small companies move faster. They know the penalties for hesitation in the marketplace. Third, in small companies, with fewer layers and less camouflage, the leaders show up very clearly on the screen. Their performance and its impact are clear to everyone. And, finally, smaller companies waste less. They spend less time in endless reviews and approvals and politics and paper drills. They have fewer people; therefore they can only do the important things. Their people are free to direct their energy and attention toward the marketplace rather than fighting bureaucracy.\\"<br />I include Welch's remarks for two reasons. First, they articulate the spirit of entrepreneurial innovation which Loudon insists is now absolutely essential to business success in the networked economy. Moreover, because in such a economy there are constant demands for newer and better innovations, there are simultaneously constant demands for newer and better ways to produce them. If I understand Loudon's book, these are among his most important points. They offer great encouragement to precisely the same companies which Welch admires so much and which the most innovative of larger organizations now work so hard to emulate.<br />Those who share my high regard for this brilliant book are urged to read Borgmann's Holding On to Reality, Nielsen's Designing Web Usability, Cairncross' recently published The Company of the Future, and Markides' All the Right Moves.l as talk; and since there are fewer of them they generally know and understand each other.

That said, I realize that for many involved in a child custody dispute, it may seem like a \\"war\\" to them. Charlotte Hardwick offers to them an abundance of practical advice as to how to formulate and then implement strategies which will help them to achieve their objectives. Almost daily it seems, the media inform us of violence which results in the deaths of estranged or divorced parents; worse yet, the deaths of their children. These are indeed tragedies. Less publicized (if at all) are child custody disputes in which one parent is better prepared than the other for obtain a court ruling favorable to her or him. (Many of murder/suicides occur after such a court ruling, despite a restraining order and other prudent precautions.) I highly recommend this book to any parent who either anticipates a child custody dispute or has become involved in one; also to grandparents and other relatives of the principals involved in such a dispute; also, to others who could become involved, such as clergy, law enforcement officials, social workers, school administrators, teachers, coaches, and even attorneys who do not specialize in child custody law. One of the greatest values of this book is that it identifies what seem to be all of the options to consider. Another is that Hardwick  helps her reader to sort through those options inorder to select those which are most appropriate. Once such selection has been made, Hardwick then answers the inevitable question \\"What now?\\" To the best of my knowledge, there is no other single volume which offers anywhere near as much information nor one which presents its often complicated material as clearly.<br />We have a large family and, thus far, have had no personal experience with a child custody case. However, over the years, several friends of our family have found themselves involved in one. Other than taking the obvious step of obtaining legal counsel, they really had no idea what to do...and not do. Hardwick wrote this book for them as well as for all others who are ill-prepared and emotionally preoccupied. Not all child custody disputes resemble \\"war\\" but all of them do have profoundly serious implications and consequences.  Hence the incalculable value of Hardwick's assistance when attempting to know what they are, to understand them, and then to proceed.n taking the obvious step of obtaining legal counsel, they really had no idea what to do...and not do.

I highly recommend both and suggest that they be read in the order in which they were written.<br />In this volume (first published in 1997), Cairncross carefully organizes her material within ten chapters following a Preface in which she observes: \\"The new ideas in this book are about the many ways in which the most significant technological changes of our time will affect the next century -- and your life. You will find a preview of the most important in 'The Trendspotter's Guide to New Communications' that immediately follows this preface; the rest of the book sets out to interpret and elaborate these key points.\\" in which she identifies and then briefly discusses \\"Ten Rules for Survival.\\" I have a minor quibble with the title because I think that technological changes to which Cairncross refers have not caused the death of distance; rather, they have re-defined it.<br />With regard to the aforementioned important developments, Cairncross identifies and then briefly discusses 30 which range from \\"The Death of Distance\\" to \\"Global Peace.\\" All are valid even as some readers may believe that others should be added to the list or replace some of those included. There are several in which I have special interest, including #27, \\"Communities of Culture.\\" Cairncross suggests that \\"electronic communications will reinforce less widespread languages and cultures. not replace them with Anglo-Saxon and Hollywood. The declining cost of creating and distributing many entertainment products and the corresponding increase in production capacity will also reinforce local cultures and help scattered peoples and families to preserve their cultural heritage.\\" Once again, many readers who agree on the importance of such trends may disagree with the implications which Cairncross derives from them. Fair enough.<br />In the final chapter, \\"Government and the Nation State,\\" Cairncross duly acknowledges that being able to communicate may not be enough to keep the nations of the earth at peace with one another \\"but it is a start.\\" Thanks to new technologies now available or which will soon become available, people will become less susceptible to, indeed dependent on propaganda from politicians who seek to stir up conflicts. Cairncross concludes, \\"Bonded together by the invisible strands of global communications, humanity may find that peace and prosperity are fostered by the death of distance.\\" She held out that possibility in 1997. Whether or not it remains a reasonable possibility is for each reader to determine. As I compose this review, violence continues to erupt in the Middle East and elsewhere; extensive poverty worldwide persists and could become even worse. Death does indeed have many faces.airncross duly acknowledges that being able to communicate may not be enough to keep the nations of the earth at peace with one another \\"but it is a start.\\" Thanks to new technologies now available or which will soon become available, people will become less susceptible to, indeed dependent on propaganda from politicians who seek to stir up conflicts.

Lee	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Practical as Well as Principled Then and Still Relevant Now	Obviously, Kaltman found in Lee's management strategies and tactics relevance to the contemporary business world. The book's subtitle reveals Kaltman's primary theme: \\"Leadership lessons for the outgunned, outnumbered, and underfinanced.\\" That is probably true of almost all of the companies now struggling to survive. The material is carefully organized within 11 chapters which correspond in chronological sequence with the various stages of Lee's career. Kaltman has identified 260 specific \\"Lessons\\" each of which he summarizes within an appropriate context and is accompanied by a Lee quotation, followed by a brief \\"Advice\\" mini-commentary. Unlike so many other books which purport to draw such correlations between the battlefield and the marketplace (e.g. The Military Genius of Daffy Duck), this one is sensible. Granted, many of the \\"Lessons\\" are rather obvious and much of the \\"Advice\\" is somewhat simplistic. However, the content is quite substantial. I think this would be an excellent gift for someone about to begin or who has only recently begun a business career. Here are Kaltman's concluding comments: \\"Robert E. Lee led armies in battle, helped reconcile a people to their defeat, and built a great educational institution. Lee never worried about his legacy; he focused on the job at hand. He believed that our legacy is the work we do to improve the human condition and bring about better times: \\"We may not see them but our children will, and we will live over again in them.\\" You may also wish to check out Kaltman's Cigars, Whiskey &amp; Winning: Leadership Lessons from Ulysses S.

From my own perspective, there are at least three major reasons for false knowledge such as misinformation, half-truths, gratifying superstitions, and pleasant myths as well as outright lies: insufficient and/or incorrect information; man's inability and/or unwillingness to accept a reality which is redundantly verifiable; and third, it serves the self-interests of those who affirm it. In this volume, Thornton examines an \\"epidemic of false knowledge\\" which is potentially more destructive than any predecessors because of technology which makes it now possible to exchange more false knowledge faster and to a much greater extent than ever before.<br /><br />In the Preface, Thornton explains that his aim \\"is not so much to assert a positive, true doctrine that should replace the false one, but rather to incite the reader's own critical eye to examine more carefully the many received truths and elements of public wisdom circulating in our collective mind. If this means that my own ideas are subjected to the same scrutiny, then this book has achieved its aim.\\"<br /><br />Following a brilliant Introduction, Thornton carefully organizes his material within Two Parts: Of the Causes of Error and Of Three Popular and Received Ideas. He then provides a Conclusion in which he correctly suggests that the threat of other plagues in years to come requires of all thoughtful persons that \\"with that ability to \\"detect and expose error and cant and [what Sir Thomas Browne once characterized as] `Prejudice and Prescription,' we will possess the most important freedom of all -- the freedom of our minds, out intellectual autonomy that allows us to confront the hard choices and make the hard decisions that are the responsibility of every citizen in a democracy.\\"<br /><br />Thornton briefly examines many of the usual suspects (e.g. logical fallacies first identified by Aristotle, such as begging the question ) and then shifts his attention, in Part II, to what he calls \\"three versions of history as therapeutic drama.\\"<br /><br />Romantic Environmentalism: Thornton asserts that \\"Humans, in sum, are not natural; nature is a necessary, but not sufficient, part of human identity. Nor is the natural world with which we are most intimate completely `natural.\\" Thousands of y<br /><br />The White Man's Golden Age Red Man: Thornton observes that \\"The tragic view of history...with all its contradictions and failed good intentions and messy complexity, is anathema to the idealizer, who finds it easier (and more profitable) to pander to the gratifying preconceptions and cheap guilt and smug compassion of contemporary whites.\\"<br /><br />The False Goddess and Her Lost Paradise: According to Thornton, \\"Goddess history offers a gratifying myth in the guise of empirical fact -- precisely the combination of scientism and debased Romanticism we have already repeatedly encountered. Indeed, the origins of Goddess religions can be found, not in the new discoveries of archeological science, but in the nineteenth-century's anti-Enlightenment pique.\\"<br /><br />Romantic environmentalism, Noble Savage Indianism, and Goddess \\"religions\\" are but three of several dozen inherently false but remarkably durable \\"versions of history as therapeutic drama.\\" No doubt many other new `versions\\" will be formulated, perhaps in strategic alliance with one or more predecessors. Some of their advocates will simply not be willing and/or able to subject them to requisite scrutiny; other advocates will exploit false knowledge to serve their own self-interests. It is probably impossible to eliminate man-made \\"epidemics\\" but Thornton believes, and I agree, that it is possible to limit their damage.<br /><br />As indicated earlier in this review, Thornton offers the reassurance that if all thoughtful persons respond \\"with that abilityto \\"detect and expose error and cant and [what Sir Thomas Browne once characterized as] `Prejudice and Prescription,' we will possess the most important freedom of all -- the freedom of our minds, out intellectual autonomy that allows us to confront the hard choices and make the hard decisions that are the responsibility of every citizen in a democracy.\\"<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Albert Borgmann's brilliant analysis of the nature of information, Holding On to Reality.e once characterized as] `Prejudice and Prescription,' we will possess the most important freedom of all -- the freedom of our minds, out intellectual autonomy that allows us to confront the hard choices and make the hard decisions that are the responsibility of every citizen in a democracy.\\"    Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Albert Borgmann's brilliant analysis of the nature of information, Holding On to Reality.	2002-03-29

The \\"Rules&quot; themselves are obvious enough (ranging from Manage Knowledge to Develop Leadership) but the context within which Cairncross examines each is understandably complex. Moreover, with consummate skill, she suggests throughout the book how all of the \\"Rules\\" are interrelated, indeed interdependent. Many of the core concepts in this book were introduced in The Death of Distance, all of which are now developed in much greater depth. However, Cairncross shifts her focus  from how the \\"communications revolution\\" is changing individual lives to how it is changing management of organizations. As she explains:<br />\\"This book aims to look beyond the traumas of recession, terrorism, and war, and to chart a course further into the future....The basic message of this book is that Internet technologies will profoundly alter the structure of the company and of many business practices. But they will do so only if accompanied by capable management, with the support of empowered and intelligent employees. getting corporate structure right will be just as important for making the best use of of Internet technologies as acquiring the right software and hardware.\\" I agree.<br />As already indicated, Cairncross examines each of the ten \\"Rules,\\" correlating and integrating combinations of them whenever appropriate. They are the recurring themes of her cohesive narrative. Then the final chapter,  she acknowledges that it would indeed be curious if the company of the future \\"turned out to look extraordinarily like the company of the day before yesterday.\\" At this point, who knows? Cairncross certainly does not profess to. Rather, with meticulous care, she examines the most relevant information, attempts to identify what may well prove to be major trends, and then extrapolates from them to a general description of the company of the future. It would be a disservice to her and to her reader to reveal in this review what her tentative conclusions are hypothesis is but I will say that they are plausible. Judge for yourself.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out three books written by Peter Schwartz and his associates.

This is the second of three books; the others are The Goal (1992) and Critical Chain (1997). In The Goal, Goldratt's primary focus is on the a-pplications of what he calls a Theory of Constraints (TOC) to the manufacturing process. In that book and in this one, he presents his ideas in the form of fiction (as a novel), complete with a cast of characters, a multi-dimensional narrative (or plot), a variety of settings, and perhaps most important of all, a series of conflicts. Few other authors with sufficient business acumen would attempt, much less succeed (as Goldratt does) in combining the two genres.  Long ago, someone suggested that luck is the residue of preparation.  Goldratt seems to agree. In this volume, he devotes much of his attention to demonstrating the relevance of TOC to marketing, sales, inventory control, distribution channels, strategic alliances, and conflict resolution. I believe it was Carl Rogers who suggested that one of the most effective strategies for conflict resolution is to set aside all points on which both parties agree, each party then makes whatever concessions are appropriate (i.e. terms and conditions of lesser importance); thereby, the parties involved can then concentrate on what are, for both sides, the most important differences. And do so with mutual respect and with goodwill. Goldratt applies the \\"Rogerian Model\\" to countless situations in this book, suggesting that conflict resolution is the result of sustained effort and patience, not luck.<br />It is occasionally said of an especially well-written business book that \\"it reads like a novel.\\" What we have here IS a novel. Never before have executives had more to read and less time for reading. One of this book's most appealing qualities is that it is so easy to read. (The challenge is to make effective applications of TOC in an increasingly more competitive marketplace.) Goldratt is an authority on the business subjects he discusses as well as an excellent teller of tales. That's a rare combination.<br />For whom will this book have greatest value? Obviously, decision-makers who now have one or more of the following needs: to set or re-set the direction of their organization; to formulate appropriate marketing and sales strategies; to improve production, logistics, and distribution; to launch or improve project management initiatives; and/or to strengthen the skills of line managers.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read Goldratt's other books, The Goal and Critical Chain; also, to check out David Maister's Practice What You Preach and David Whyte's The Heart Aroused.

That is certainly true of this book. Consider this brief excerpt from the Afterword in which Fink observes: \\"Acts of terror [e.g. such as those which occurred on September 11th] notwithstanding, economic espionage remains one of the most serious threats to our national security since the Cold War. Therefore, we ought to have seasoned generals leading, and weathered soldiers fighting, the good battles that need to be fought.\\" However, with all due respect to the F.B.I. and to legislation such as the Economic Espionage Act [EEA], \\"...you still need to be your own best defense against espionage with proper internal education, training, and procedures\\" and under no circumstances \\"delegate the crisis management work for your company to the government. It is too important.\\" This brief excerpt helps to explain why this book can be so valuable to decision-makers in global organizations.<br />Recent research studies have dentified issues of greatest concern to senior-level executives, following September 11th. The top five are mail processing (86%), travel (85%), protection of employees (79%), protection of infrastructure (75%), and risk assessment (71%). Obviously, there is widespread and quite legitimate concern about protecting human beings and physical property. However, as Fink eloquently explains,  we must also be concerned about -- and take appropriate measures to protect -- information which is as important to the global economy as oxygen is to the human body.<br />As events on September 11th clearly indicate, even a country with resources such as those possessed by the United States cannot totally defend itself and its people against terrorists acts. However, because the U.S.A. remains the world leader in research, development, new technology, products, and trade secrets, organizations within the U.S.A. are high-profile targets and \\"economic espionage spies are still going to come after [them] and that only increases [the] global risk of economic espionage.\\" As previously indicated, Fink's book examines the nature and extent of that potential risk, suggesting all manner of strategies and tactics to anticipate and then prepare for, as well as respond to, economic espionage because it is \\"a business crisis and should be treated as such.\\"<br />Fink asserts that \\"Companies are under attack and at enormous risk every day. from the global threat of economic espionage, but the risk can and should be lowered and managed. Here's how.\\" He organizes his material within two Sections and presents it in 29 interrelated chapters, followed by an Afterword in which he addresses the question, \\"EEA: Bear Trap or Mouse Trap?\\" To explain \\"here's how\\", he uses the largest economic espionage case ever tried in the United States -- Avery Dennison/Four Pillars -- from his vantage point as the lead crisis management expert for Avery Dennison. Fink guides his reader step-by-step through that seminal case, also also citing along the way relevant situations in other companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gillette, Kodak, Lucent Technologies, and MasterCard.<br />Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book? Obviously decision-makers in global organizations. Also service providers to those organizations (e.g. attorneys, accountants, insurance underwriters, management consultants) as well as officials in governmental agencies who are directly or indirectly involved in economic espionage threats as well as acts. I also highly recommend Fink's previous book, Crisis Management, first published in 1986 but more relevant today than ever before. America is at greatest risk because it has the most worth stealing.

It is a culture and way of living; a fundamental belief that people are the real force in commerce and that business and the street cannot survive separately.\\" I begin my review with this brief excerpt because, with these remarks, Gobe creates a frame of reference for his reader before providing information and insights which differentiate his book from any other on the same general subject.<br />After an Introduction (\\"Emotional Branding: Fuel for Success in the Twenty-first Century\\"), Gobe presents his material within four Sections and then provides a Conclusion in which he acknowledges that branding is not for everyone while asserting that branding is about cultural relevance and emotional connection, not hype. For those who are responsible for devising, launching, and then managing a successful, emotionalized brand, he suggests three \\"essential\\" ideas: 1. \\"Brands have life cycles. The future of a brand is defined by its relevance at any given time and by how well it can protect the values that made it great. 2. Brands are elected every day based on their emotional relevance with the public and its commitment to quality. 3. Real brands are about meaning and truth.\\" Here are some of the questions to which Gobe responds:<br />1. How can a brand engage people on the level of their senses and emotions?<br />2. Which brands have done so most effectively? How?<br />3. What is the biggest misconception in branding strategies? Why?<br />4. What are \\"The Ten Commandments of Emotional Branding\\"?<br />5.

Why?<br />These questions correctly suggest the scope and depth of Gobe's perspectives on emotional branding. Throughout the book, he cites and discusses examples of branding initiatives which either succeeded or failed. I am also grateful for the inclusion of highly innovative graphics which illustrate \\"thinking out of the box\\" while creating an advertising campaign.  (See the Introduction to Section III.)  Gobe concludes his book with this observation: \\"To get people interested in a long-term relationship, keep your ear to the ground and always be ready for any market changes. Change is good, but predicting change is better -- the answer is within people's hearts.\\"  In this remarkable book, Gobe does indeed offer a new paradigm for connecting brands to people.<br />Those who share my high regard for Emotional Branding are strongly urged to check out Levitt's The Marketing Imagination, Ries and Trout's Positioning (NOT the sequel, The New Positioning), Brands: The New Wealth Creators edited by Hart and Murphy, Schmitt's Experiential Marketing, and Pine and Gilmore's The Experience Economy.

1602470:US	51147790	R3K82P0XKRLETT	0312282575	635122671	Knight: My Story	Books	5	11	17	N	N	Selective and Subjective	What we have here is Knight's version of a \\"story\\" which began in 1940 when he was born in Orrville, Ohio. He played for Ohio State (starting only two games in three years but was the \\"sixth man\\" on an NCAA championship team in 1960), began his coaching career as an assistant at Cuyahoga Falls (Ohio), was head coach at the U.S. Military Academy, and then at Indiana University where three of his teams won an N.C.A.A. championship. Today, he coaches at Texas Tech University. As with all other memoirs, Knight's is both selective and subjective: selective in terms of what Knight remembers (or at least what he is willing to share with his reader) and subjective in terms of how he interprets that \\"what.\\" Having coached varsity basketball in New England for 13 years at two different boarding schools, I was soon convinced that basketball is probably the most difficult game to officiate. Almost all of the calls are subjective. Officials do not call what happened; rather, they call what they think they saw happen. I suspect that Knight encountered a similar situation when writing this book with Bob Hammel. His account may not be in all respects exactly what has happened in his life thus far but I am convinced that what he offers in this book is what Knight sincerely believes happened. More revealing, to me at least, is his explanations of why he was involved in so many different controversies along the way.<br />According to Knight, he has almost always been a victim of circumstances such as when he was accused of assaulting a police officer in Puerto Rico and arrested (1979), of choking an Indiana player (Neil Reed) in 1997, grabbing the arm of an Indiana student (Kent Harvey) in 2000, and then verbally abusing the university's female legal counsel. Also in his opinion, he was victimized by the \\"stupidities\\" of Indiana University officials (notably President Myles Brand) and fired without just cause. Knight discusses these and other circumstances in this memoir. He is (with few exceptions) highly critical of journalists, especially sports writers, for unfairly exaggerating various incidents and thereby misrepresenting (if not totally misunderstanding) his intentions. For example, with regard to the incident in which he hurled a folding chair across a basketball court, he has explained with evident pride in his chair-throwing skill, that no one was in any danger. His nickname \\"The General\\" reminds me of George S. Patton who, until the day he died, felt victimized by the coverage of his soldier-slapping incident. (In fact, Patton slapped several whom he accused of cowardice and insubordination.) Among the recurrent themes throughout this book is Knight's strong sense of righteous indignation but keep in mind that all this is his version of what happened. Also why.<br />So what do I make of this book? As a former basketball coach, I thoroughly enjoyed the detailed accounts of various seasons and of especially important games. Also, in fairness to Knight, I am grateful (I really am) to share his perspectives on what has obviously been, until now, a highly complicated and controversial career. Knight helps me to understand why so many people love him, respect him, and support him. Perhaps without realizing it, he also helps me to understand why so many other people view him with contempt and even hostility. At least in one respect, Knight reminds me of Billy Martin and Woody Hayes who, when working with certain kinds of athletes (talented, obedient, thick-skinned, deferential, preferably reverential), consistently produced winning teams. Also like Knight, their behavior on and off the field of competition was highly controversial and both of them frequently expressed the same righteous indignation which Knight does in this book.<br />Even his severest critics concede that Knight is a great basketball coach. No one denies that he loves the game and coaches it with both passion and precision. These same critics also concede that there have been many instances in which Knight has demonstrated extraordinary kindness, compassion, and generosity with his players, albeit after they no longer played for him. And finally, his critics (albeit grudgingly) concede that he is highly intelligent, has a sharp wit, is wholeheartedly loyal and devoted to family members and friends, and (when so inclined) can really turn on the charm.

This is the third of three books; the others are The Goal (1992) and It's Not Luck (1994). As in those earlier works, Goldratt presents his ideas in this volume within the structure of a novel. When doing so, I think he is much less effective as a storyteller than he is introducing and then developing his core concepts about project management. I am among those who are convinced that process management and project management are not mutually exclusive; on the contrary, I believe that effective project management must be integrated within effective process management inorder to improve, for example, cycle time and first pass yield. Moreover, one of the greatest challenges is to identify root causes of barriers to the process and then eliminate them.<br />Another formidable challenge to any organization (regardless of size or nature) is to become and then remain performance-driven, rather than culture-driven. Whatever the \\"critical chain\\" may be, its weakest \\"link\\" is the limiting factor. One of the worst mistakes made, when problems develop, is to respond to symptoms rather than to root causes. As a result, the weakest \\"link\\" is seldom strengthened and perhaps not even identified.<br />In this volume, Goldratt once again examines a fictional context within which there is a cast of characters, a multi-dimensional narrative (or plot), and all manner of disagreements which create conflicts. Never before have executives had more to read and less time for reading. One of this book's most appealing qualities is that it is so easy to read. (The challenge is to make effective applications of TOC in an increasingly more competitive marketplace.) Goldratt is an authority on the business subjects he discusses as well as an excellent teller of tales. That's a rare combination. Once again, he suggests all manner of applications of his Theory of Constraints (TOC). And once again, Goldratt helps the reader to determine how to apply the TOC to her or his own organization.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read his  other books, The Goal and It's Not Luck; also, to check out David Maister's Practice What You Preach and David Whyte's The Heart Aroused. With all due respect to the core concepts which Goldratt examines so brilliantly in this volume, they are worthless unless and until embraced by everyone involved.

This is the first of three books; the others are It's Not Luck (1997) and Critical Chain (1997). He wrote this book with Jeff Cox, author of Zapp!: The Lightening of Empowerment: How to Improve Quality, Productivity, and Employee Satisfaction. All decision-makers in organizations (regardless of their size or nature) are constantly preoccupied with improving cycle time, first pass yield and on-time delivery inorder to increase productivity and thereby increase profits. Many of them, perhaps, have a difficult time grasping the core concepts of process improvement systems such as Six Sigma. Goldratt has written a novel in which he provides an analysis of those concepts as applied in a fictional company. He has a cast of characters, a plot, and a context. He relies heavily on dialogue to advance the narrative. As in any other well-written novel, The Goal examines issues in dispute which create conflicts. Ultimately they are resolved, albeit somewhat too neatly. Although of greatest relevance to manufacturing companies, Goldratt's Theory of Constraints (with appropriate modifications) can also be of substantial value to other companies with \\"bottlenecks\\" which also delay and often disrupt a process of some kind. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read Goldratt's other two; also, to check out David Mistress Practice What You Preach and David Whyte's The Heart Aroused.

Its title could also be \\"The Well-Lived Life.\\" Those who have read his Connected Executives already know how much importance he gives to enjoyable as well as productive human activity. Throughout human history, playing all manner of games has been and continues to be one of the human race's defining characteristics.  For whatever reasons, some people view \\"games\\" as being merely recreational while others view them as trivial.  DeKoven takes \\"games\\" very seriously because he seems to believe, and I agree, that in our contemporary society, there is a great deal of pleasure but very little joy. Unabashedly, DeKoven celebrates the playing of games well for the joy it can provide. Those of us who have been associated with the Special Olympics can attest to the great importance of participation for its own sake, rather than for any awards to be won. There are no \\"losers\\" among the participants in Special Olympics. In the games which really matter, there never are.<br />In his Preface, DeKoven refers to a \\"unique and profound synthesis\\" whenever a game has been well-played. Having explored the meaning and implications of this synthesis, DeKoven concludes that having fun is much more important than winning. The greatest competitors (in athletics, politics,  business, whatever) manifest the \\"synthesis\\" which informs and directs DeKoven's observations throughout the book. That is to say, an athlete such as Michael Jordan, a politician such as Theodore Roosevelt, and a business executive such as Jack Welch ultimately compete only with themselves. They are literally obsessed with playing the given \\"game\\" to the absolute limit of their capabilities. They hate to lose, of course, but what they hate even more is to lose because of insufficient preparation, concentration, and engagement. There can never be any joy for them in a less-than-best effort. The well-played game is a celebration of their potential fulfilled...whatever the final \\"score\\" may prove to be.<br />If I understand DeKoven correctly, his fundamental thesis in this book is that all \\"games\\" should be well-played within a framework of \\"rules\\" agreed upon by participants. Even in the absence of such agreement, each of us must still be guided by both passion and delight in the playing of them as well as we can. Such \\"games\\" range from marriage and parenthood to career and citizenship. What we must do, DeKoven seems to suggest, is to validate the playing of games for the fun of it, whatever the eventual result may be; also, in so doing, to affirm excellence of effort (both our own and others') and thereby extend and enrich a sense of shared community; finally, by playing each game well \\"we might be able to raise the stakes infinitely.\\"<br />DeKoven encourages me to wonder: What if we called \\"Time Out!\\" on verbal and physical violence in all forms throughout the world? What if we agreed to have a global picnic to which everyone is invited? In addition to an abundance of delicious food, there would be lively music, hot air balloons, pony rides, and group activities which include all manner of games plus kite flying, square dancing, and a karaoke contest. (Only heads of state would be allowed to participate in mudwrestling competition.) And why not have everyone wear one of those Dr. Seuss hats? Of course, such a global picnic will never happen but wouldn't it be fun? If national armies and allied forces can fight well together, surely they and their opponents can also play well together. DeKoven has almost unlimited faith in what the human race can accomplish if the \\"games\\"  played celebrate both competence and joy...and are played well.lfilled...whatever the final \\"score\\" may prove to be. <br />If I understand DeKoven correctly, his fundamental thesis in this book is that all \\"games\\" should be well-played within a framework of \\"rules\\" agreed upon by participants.

Both are even more important now than when originally published. In this volume, Case develops his key ideas in much greater depth while examining more than 100 companies which -- to varying extent -- have implemented open-book principles. Perhaps without intending to, some reviewers have incorrectly suggested that these principles have relevance only to publicly-traded companies. In fact, I think they can also be of substantial value to non-profits as well as to privately-owned companies. Consider the over-used phrase \\"taking ownership\\" in the context of assuming responsibility for helping to reduce costs by completing more and better work in less time or in the context of assuming responsibility for making certain that a customer's problem has been solved. Heaven knows, what Case advocates will increase \\"business literacy\\" among everyone involved in a given enterprise but it can and should accomplish more, much more.<br />For example, effective application of open-book principles will create a \\"transparent\\" organization. That is, one in which everyone is kept fully informed of what is most important to the success of that enterprise. Such knowledge includes but is by no means is limited to financial information which explains, for example, how much it costs to open the door each business day or how much money is  spent on training, overtime, postage, shipping, etc. According to Case, \\"Really the only way for a company to boost performance consistently over the long terms is to have employees who work enthusiastically and effectively and who take responsibility for their own work. Good systems -- meaning good procedures and equipment -- are indispensable. But what makes the difference in the end is whether the employees doing the job think about doing it just a little bit better and care whether they do or don't.\\" At a time when competition is more ferocious than ever before, \\"battles\\" will be won or lost within what Case characterizes as \\"the human dimension of business -- the wanting, the caring, the enthusiasm, the problem solving and initiative taking.\\" Open-book principles offer a new approach to management, one which starts from scratch with a new set of assumptions \\"about how people in an organization work together.\\" In this volume, citing countless real-world applications of those principles, Case explains HOW...and, of equal importance, WHY.<br />If possible, read Open-Book Management first. You may also wish to check out Kaplan and Norton's The Balanced Scorecard: Translating Strategy into Action and then its sequel, The Strategy-Focused Organization: How Balanced Scorecard Companies Thrive in the New Business Environment. Perhaps the Lone Ranger could prevail armed only with a silver bullet but the rest of us need a full arsenal of weapons.

Frankly, I found none of Sutton's ideas \\"weird.\\" Unorthodox, thought-provoking, and perhaps even somewhat controversial but certainly not weird. (Perhaps the title was devised to accommodate marketing needs.) He makes two important distinctions: between routine work (essentially defending and sustaining the status quo) and innovative work (challenging and disrupting, perhaps even transforming the status quo), and, between invention (creating something entirely new) and innovation (discovering new applications for what has already been invented). He also correctly acknowledges the advantages and disadvantages of separating innovation initiatives from the traditional organization structure. In Organizing Genius, Patricia Ward Biederman and Warren Bennis explain why it was so important to establish Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in California, far removed from corporate headquarters in Connecticut. Sutton suggests that such separation may not always be possible or at least prudent. In general, though, innovation is most productive when not constrained by limits of any kind. Indeed, innovation worthy of the name is by nature anathema to order and structure. For me, the greatest value of this book lies not in any one or even in all of the \\"Weird Ideas\\" which Sutton proposes; rather, in what could be the \\"world view\\" and mindsets which those ideas suggest. \\"Feelings -- not cold cognitions -- drive people to turn good ideas into reality....Every innovative company I know is passionate about solving problems....Playfulness and curiosity are related attitudes of innovation [in combination with] the ability to switch emotional gears between cynicism and belief, or between deep doubt and unshakable confidence.\\" If you take Sutton's admonitions to heart, challenge all of his ideas as well as everyone else's ideas and come up with more innovative ones of your own. Throughout the 15 chapters which comprise this book, he carefully prepares his reader to do just that.he 15 chapters which comprise this book, he carefully prepares his reader to do just that.	2002-03-21

My guess (only a guess) is that experienced sales managers and salespersons will find little (if anything) in this book they do not already know. However, reading and then re-reading it will have value to them because it is often helpful to be reminded of what one already knows. The material is organized within ten Sections, each of which ends with a Summary of key points. The book's greatest value will be for those now thinking about a career in sales or for those only recently embarked on that career.

In his Introduction, Christensen makes his objective crystal clear: \\"This book is about the failure of companies to remain competitive when they confront certain types of market and technological change....the good companies -- the kinds that many managers have admired for years and tried to emulate, the companies known for their abilities to innovate and execute....It is about well-managed companies that have their competitive antennae up, listen astutely to their customers....invest aggressively in new technologies, and yet they still lose market dominance.\\" Why? For Christensen, the answer is revealed in what he calls \\"the innovator's dilemma\\": the logical, competent decisions of management which are critical to the success of their companies are also the reasons why they lose their positions of leadership.<br />In Part One, Chapters 1-4, Christensen builds a framework that explains why sound decisions by great managers can lead to failure. In Part Two, Chapters 5-10, he attempts to resolve the dilemma by examining why and under what circumstances new technologies have caused great firms to fail. He makes an important distinction between sustaining technologies and those which are disruptive. He offers four \\"laws or principles\\" of disruptive technology:<br />#1: Companies depend on customers and investors for resources (Chapter 5)<br />#2: Small markets don't solve the growth needs of large companies (Chapter 6)<br />#3: Markets that don't exist can't be analyzed (Chapter 7)<br />#4: Technology supply may not equal market demand (Chapter 8)<br />Actually, these four could also be viewed as guidelines as well as check-points by which to detect early-warning danger signs. Unless and until, however,  it becomes obvious that a given technology will create sustaining rather than only temporary disruption. One of the book's most important points seems to confirm what Pogo the Possum once said: \\"We have met the enemy and he is us.\\" Nearly all of the corporate wounds which Christensen examines are self-inflicted. If not in all instances avoidable, at least the damage done could at least have been reduced.<br />For example, Christensen examines companies in which (a) disruptive technologies were first developed internally, (b) marketing personnel then sought reactions from lead customers, (c) the pace of sustaining technological development was accelerated, (d) disaffected employees created new companies and (by trial and error) located markets for disruptive technology, (e) moved upmarket in direct competition, and (f) caused established firms to respond in defense of their own customer base. In essence, well-established companies (\\"incumbents\\") thus become threatened by \\"entrants\\" and a disruptive technology change. In response, they re-allocate resources away from those technologies which address their customers' needs.<br />When reading this book, note in particular Christensen's detailed analysis of a disruptive technological change in the mechanical excavator industry (Chapter Three) and the correlations between value networks and characteristic cost structures (Chapter Four). Once again, he reveals how and why sound management decisions can often be \\"at the very root of [a 'good' company's] impending fall from industry leadership.\\"<br />In Part Two, Christensen describes in detail HOW managers can address and harness four principles by which to prevail against disruptive technologies. Once again, he asserts that a company's customers effectively control what it can and cannot do. Managers who deny or ignore this do so at great peril. To support his assertion, Christensen examines several quite different companies: Quantum, Plus Development, Control Data, Micropolis, DEC, IBM, Kresge, Woolworth, and Hewlett-Packard. In some of these companies, the innovating managers who were faced with disruptive technologies created organizationswhose cost structures enabled them to make money in the value network where the disruptive technology was taking root, and where customers' power and the managers' intentions were aligned. The emphasis is on alignment. In Chapter Six, Christensen insists that managers must be leaders, not followers, in commercializing disruptive change. Hence the importance of a strategic decision: To be a leader or a follower? It is often prudent for \\"incumbents\\" to be followers, resisting pressure from customers, until opportunities to commercialize disruptive technologies are sufficient and appropriate. As Christensen suggests, \\"In sustaining technologies, in fact, evidence strongly suggests that companies which focus on extending the performance of conventional technologies, and choose to be followers in adopting new ones, can remain strong and competitive.\\"<br />Chapter Ten summarizes various key points. By now Christensen has offered dozens of examples of \\"some very capable executives in some extraordinarily successful companies, using the best managerial techniques, who have led their firms toward failure.\\" Lest this brief commentary suggest otherwise, managers in every organization (regardless of size or nature) eventually must resolve \\"the innovator's dilemma.\\" Christensen's book provides invaluable assistance to completing that immensely difficult process. It remains for each of his readers to answer questions such as these: Which customers do we want? Which technologies will help us to get and then keep them? For each technology, which strategies will be most effective to sustain it? Should we attack competitors with disruptive technology? How can we best defend ourselves against it? How should our resources be allocated? What about timing? Should we lead or follow? If we follow, should we prepare to lead later?<br />Finding the correct (i.e. most appropriate) answers to questions such as these will obviously help to clarify today's realities and to suggest strategies for an uncertain future. But beware of taking anyone or anything for granted. As Christensen explains so eloquently and compellingly, the process of resolving one major dilemma may well reveal others.

How Leaders Build Lasting Relationships	Books	5	9	12	N	N	The ROI of Integrity	In a brilliant essay which appeared in the Harvard Business Review, Reichheld shares research which suggests that companies with faithful employees, customers, and investors (i.e. capital sources which include banks) share one key attribute: leaders who stick with six \\"bedrock principles\\": preach what you practice, play to win-win, be picky, keep it simple, reward the right results, and finally, listen hard...talk straight. In The Loyalty Effect, Reichheld organizes his material within 11 chapters which range from \\"Loyalty and Value\\" to \\"Getting Started: The Path Toward Zero Defections.\\" With meticulous care, he explains how to devise and them implement programs which will help any organization to earn the loyalty of everyone involved in the enterprise. Reichheld draws upon a wealth of real-world experience which he and his associates have accumulated at Bain &amp; Company, a worldwide strategy consulting firm. Reichheld heads up its Loyalty Practice.<br />In his most recently published book, Practice What You Preach, David Maister explains why there must be no discrepancy whatsoever between the \\"talk\\" we talk and the \\"walk\\" we walk. Reichheld agrees, noting that the \\"key\\" to the success of his own organization \\"has been its loyalty to two principles: first, that our primary mission is to create value for our clients, and second, that our most precious asset is the employees dedicated to making productive contributions to client value creation. Whenever we've been perfectly centered on these two principles, our business has prospered.\\" It is no coincidence that the world's most highly admired companies are also the most profitable within their respective industries. I wholly agree with Reichheld that loyalty is critically important as a measure of value creation and as a source of profit but that it is by no means \\"a cure-all or a magic bullet.\\" Loyalty is based on trust and respect. It must be earned, usually over an extended period of time and yet can be lost or compromised at any time with a single betrayal.<br />In Loyalty Rules!, Reichheld develops these and other ideas (the foundation of what he calls an \\"economic framework\\") in much greater depth as he explains how today's leaders build lasting relationships beyond as well as within their organizations.  \\"Loyalty cannot begin with tools; it must begin with leaders who recognize the enormous value of building and maintaining mutually beneficial relationships....Accordingly, this book spends at least as much time on the underlying objectives for building loyalty as it does on the how-to's.\\" He organizes his material within eight chapters which range from \\"Timeless Principles\\" (previously introduced in The Loyalty Effect) to \\"Preach What You Practice\\" in which he asserts that actions speak louder than words and together, they are \\"unbeatable.\\" One of this book's greatest benefits is provided in a series of \\"Action Checklists\\" which reiterate key ideas while suggesting specific initiatives to implement them effectively. The book concludes with an appendix, \\"The Loyalty Acid Test,\\" which consists of separate surveys of consumers and employees. Obviously, each reader must modify either survey to ensure that it is appropriate to her or his own organization's specific needs and objectives. However, all modifications should be consistent with the `timeless principles\\" which Reichheld examines in the first chapter. I highly recommend this book, presuming to suggest that, if possible, The Loyalty Effect be read first.compromised at any time with a single betrayal.<br />In Loyalty Rules!, Reichheld develops these and other ideas (the foundation of what he calls an \\"economic framework\\") in much greater depth as he explains how today's leaders build lasting relationships beyond as well as within their organizations.  \\"Loyalty cannot begin with tools; it must begin with leaders who recognize the enormous value of building and maintaining mutually beneficial relationships....Accordingly, this book spends at least as much time on the underlying objectives for building loyalty as it does on the how-to's.\\" He organizes his material within eight chapters which range from \\"Timeless Principles\\" (previously introduced in The Loyalty Effect) to \\"Preach What You Practice\\" in which he asserts that actions speak louder than words and together, they are \\"unbeatable.\\" One of this book's greatest benefits is provided in a series of \\"Action Checklists\\" which reiterate key ideas while suggesting specific initiatives to implement them effectively.

In that sense, this book really is for \\"everyone\\" in need of such guidance. With regard to the forms themselves, it is important to keep in mind that there are three different codes of law in the United States and that some laws vary (sometimes substantially) from one state, county, or municipality to the next. Therefore, it would be prudent to obtain legal counsel to review the completed forms before they are filed. Obviously, thanks to Battle, the cost of such counsel will be substantially reduced. (The title of Chapter 2 is \\"Finding the Best Lawyer for You.\\") A significant value-added benefit is the CD-ROM on which all forms are contained. There is another, perhaps less obvious benefit: Careful completion of any of the forms enables those who do so to understand the legal context within which information is assembled. For that reason, I urge those who purchase this book to read all of the 24 chapters. Thoughtfully, Battle also provides an appendix for those seeking \\"Sources of Additional Information.\\"	2002-03-18
1619056:US	51147790	R2I3ELZOEFHTN3	087584801X	71649736	Unleashing the Killer App: Digital Strategies for Market Dominance	Books	5	8	8	N	N	The ROI of Innovation	I've just re-read this book and think more highly of it now than I did previously. Larry Downes &amp; Chunka Mui define a \\"killer application\\" as \\"a new good or service that establishes an entirely new category and, by being first, dominates it, returning several hundred percent on the initial investment.\\" As they explain, the primary forces at work in spawning today's \\"killer apps\\" are both technological and economic in nature. \\"The technology we are concerned with is the transformation of information into digital form, where it can be manipulated by computers and transmitted by networks.\\" Digital strategies are needed to achieve market dominance.<br />The co-authors divide their book into three parts: Digital Strategy, Designing the Killer App, and Unleashing the Killer App. In Part I, there is a brief discussion of one \\"killer app\\" in the Middle Ages, the stirrup, which added mounted cavalry to the battle equation. The \\"lowly stirrup\\" played a singular role in rearranging the political, social, and economic structure of medieval Europe.<br />In The Lever of Riches, Joel Mokyr identifies countless other \\"killer apps\\" throughout history such as paved streets and sewerage disposal; the lever, wedge, and screw; the heavy plow and three-field system; the weight-driven mechanical clock; spectacles; the printing press; the steam engine; the telegraph; the bicycle; ...each of which also had a truly profound impact.<br />To repeat, Larry Downes &amp; Chunka Mui concern themselves with the technology of transforming information into digital form. Thus in Part I, they examine the \\"killer app\\", explain what they call \\"the new economics\\", and then shift their attention to the nature of a digital strategy. They dully acknowledge the disruptive power of \\"killer apps\\" which can suddenly destroy the equilibrium of what appeared to be stable systems of commerce and government. For them, business change now originates with digital technology; more specifically, with \\"killer apps.\\" Strategies are needed to manage (to the extent possible) their impact to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. These strategies must accommodate three new forces: digitization, globalization, and deregulation. The \\"dirty little secret\\" to which Gary Hamel has referred is that the strategy industry \\"doesn't have any theory of strategy creation.\\" The success of any digital strategy may well be the result of what Hamel calls \\"lucky foresight.\\" Downes &amp; Mui seem to agree with Hamel while offering, in Part II, what they refer to as \\"a few rules of thumb.\\" They suggest three stages of \\"killer app\\" design and carefully explain each. They identify 12 specific principles on which to base the design process. In Part III, they shift their attention to \\"Unleashing the Killer App\\" and correctly  stress the importance of communication, one which \\"speaks with the language of ideas, scenarios, options, and what-ifs.\\"<br />In Chapter 7, the reader's attention is directed to two major corporations, McDonald's and VEBA AG, which illustrate digital strategy in practice. These are, in effect, mini-case studies. It is important to point out, however, that effective digital strategies are not the sole province of major corporations such as these. A \\"killer app\\" can quickly increase or reduce the size of any company. Consider the fact that a single dry goods store in Kemmerer (Wyoming) can become the J.C. Penney Company which, in turn, now struggles (with mixed results) to compete successfully with a company whose own history can be traced back to the Walton 5&amp;10 in Bentonville (Arkansas). Downes &amp; Mui assert that \\"Developing digital strategy...requires components of both problem-pull and technology-push...operating together in a well-functioning organization [in which] the process becomes not only circular but indistinguishable...in a pragmatic, indeed opportunistic, response to the new digital environment.\\"<br />In the final chapter of their brilliant analysis, Downes &amp; Mui suggest that cyberspace \\"is fueled by free computing power and free bandwidth...and free software.\\" Consequently, \\"the social conditions that resulted are raw, and the nature of the business climate, by necessity, less developed.\\" As with The Golden Rule dry goods store (in 1902) and then the Walton 5&amp;10 (in 1950), today's companies must seek out new areas of opportunity and start doing business there. \\"Those who make the transformation by developing a digital strategy are choosing to engage the frontier on its own terms, just as their counterparts from Europe did in settling the New World.\\"<br />Larry Downes &amp; Chunka Mui have outlined the process of digital strategy, explained the twelve design principles, and described the experiences of organizations that are transforming themselves so that they can unleash \\"killer apps.\\" Which companies will conquer the \\"frontier\\", whatever and wherever it may be? Which companies will not? In the Digital Marketplace, we won't have to wait very long for the answers. Probably in what seems to be about five minutes.

Auden, Jacques Barzun, and Lionel Trilling from The Reader's Subscription and Mid-Century Book Clubs	Books	5	25	25	N	N	The Culture of "Inclusiveness"	While I was growing up in Chicago, one of my greatest pleasures was listening to classical music while reading the latest selection from the Readers' Subscription Club to which I belonged. That was almost 50 years ago (!) and yet how vividly I recall pouring over brief but brilliant essays in the latest edition of The Griffin (the monthly bulletin) to select titles to order and then, several weeks later, reading those selected as soon as they arrived. (By the way, I found Bach's &#34;Goldberg Variations&#34; to be an ideal companion to my reading, regardless of subject matter.) In this volume, with a Foreword by Jacques Barzun, followed by an Introduction by editor Arthur Krystal, we have a rich and varied selection of the uncollected writings of W.H. Auden, Jacques Barzun, and Lionel Trilling who, from 1951 until 1963, served as editors of the Readers' Subscription Club which later became the Mid-Century Book Society. As I began to read this book, I recognized only a few of the 45 essays which Krystal has organized as follows:<br /><br />o Biography and Belles Lettres (e.g. Barzun's &#34;The Artist as Scapegoat&#34;)<br />o History and Social Thought (Auden's &#34;Apologies to the Iroquois&#34;)<br />o Novels and Novelists (e.g. Trilling's &#34;A Triumph of the Comic View&#34;)<br />o Music, Theater, and Fine Arts (e.g. Barzun's &#34;Why Talk About Art?&#34;)<br />o Poetry (.e.g. Auden's &#34;T.S. Eliot So Far&#34;)<br />o A Round-robin (i.e. all three editors collaborated on &#34;The New Auden Shakespeare&#34; and &#34;Jameschoice for January.&#34;<br />o Krystal then provides an &#34;Editor's Note,&#34; followed by two appendices: Complete List of Essays and Reviews from The Griffin and The Mid-Century, and, Essays from The Griffin and The Mid-Century Published Elsewhere.<br /><br />After reading all of the selections in this volume, I now realize and appreciate what I did not (and probably could not) so many years ago: the three erudite and eloquent authors of the selections never &#34;wrote down&#34; to their readers while providing an intellectual, aesthetic, and (at times) social context for each of the authors and works discussed.<br /><br />In the Foreword, Barzun explains that &#34;As critics we had one trait in common: none of us applied a theory or system. Apart from this unifying mode, our tendencies and backgrounds differed widely, surely a desirable diversity for the purposes of the club.&#34; He goes on to point out that they were guided by &#34;the principle of what Trilling was the first to call 'cultural criticism,' that is, criticism inspired by whatever is relevant to the work. Its genesis, form, and meaning have roots in the culture where it appears, and it is also unique through its author's own uniqueness. To us, none of this was new. We were cultural critics with no need of a doctrine, for the essence of culture is inclusiveness.&#34;<br /><br />In the Introduction, Krystal then provides a brief explanation of how and why the Club was founded, what happened throughout its eleven years and six months of existence, and what he views as its unique contributions. Auden, Barzun, and Trilling &#34;were like those classical musicians who, upon leaving work at the symphony, head downtown to play jazz all night in a smoky club.&#34; No small part of the &#34;pleasure they derived from playing together...lay in the knowledge that they were performing for a literate audience who had come expressly to hear them.&#34; This simile is apt.<br /><br />Who will most enjoy reading this book? Certainly those who were once a member of either Club and have so many pleasant memories of their own associated with the monthly interaction with the three editors as well as with the subjects they discussed. But countless others, &#34;non-members&#34; if you will, who will also be intellectually stimulated while thoroughly enjoying the pleasure of the three editors' company. Jacques Barzun was right: &#34;The essence of culture isinclusiveness.&#34;	2002-03-13

By then, Feinstein had earned and deserved his reputation as a first-rate journalist. Presumably that was one of the major reasons why Knight was agreeable. Later, Knight was very displeased with the book based on that season. (I am reminded of what Harry S Truman once said when someone urged him to \\"give 'em hell\\" during the 1948 Presidential campaign. \\"I just tell them the truth and they think it's hell.\\") Two points seem especially important to me as a controversy about A Season on the Brink continues: This is Feinstein's account of what he observed and experienced; also. Knight and everyone else involved (including Feinstein) are entitled to their own opinion as to how accurate (if not \\"fair\\") that account is. My own opinion is that prior to and then following the 1985-86 season, Knight's behavior (including public statements) suggests that Feinstein's account is mostly credible. Since his playing days at Ohio State and then coaching at the United States Military Academy, Knight left no doubt that he was an intense competitor who loved the game with passion and studied it with intensity. He arrived at Indiana University a known quantity and was remarkably consistent (for better or worse) throughout the years he coached there.<br />For every person who views Knight's values with contempt, there is probably someone else who admires those same values. He is obviously a complicated person. Also, as he himself has frequently conceded, he can be contradictory. (Years before the 1985-86 season, Knight observed \\"I don't agree with everything I do.\\") Many of the players whom he verbally abused the most were later treated with exceptional kindness and generosity. Feinstein's book suggests various forces which inform and direct Knight's behavior (commendable or otherwise) and I rate this book so highly because Feinstein enables his reader to accompany him during an extended association with Knight and the Indiana basketball program. Whatever your own opinion of Knight, Feinstein's book examines in depth a great basketball coach and demonstrably imperfect human being during a pivotal season more than 15 years ago.<br />My own opinion is that Knight, then and now, is not so contemptible as many insist nor as admirable as many others insist. Final point: Knight has always overseen a \\"clean\\" program and has coached, year after year, young men most of whom have earned earned a college degree. Presumably Feinstein respects that and so should we. Those who wish to know what Knight thinks about all this are urged to read his own book, Knight: My Story, which has just been published.is reader to accompany him during an extended association with Knight and the Indiana basketball program.

Here are three of the reasons. First, it is ludicrous for Augustine and Adelman to try to correlate the highly structured system of hierarchies within the Elizabethan Chain of Being with the 21st century business world. Granted, much of value can be learned, for example, from the leadership and management of England by Elizabeth I as indeed Axelrod in Elizabeth I CEO as well as Higgins and Gilberd in Leadership Secrets of Elizabeth I have already demonstrated. Nonetheless, Shakespeare's major characters share a world view which is wholly different from that shared by the most admired contemporary CEOs (e.g. Gerstner, Grove, Kelleher, Walton, and Welch). Second, the tone and diction of Augustine and Adelman's narrative trivialize many of Shakespeare's most profound insights into human nature. They discuss literary characters based on historical figures as if they actually are historical figures and they discuss plot developments as if they are actual historical events. Third, and most disappointing to me, Augustine and Adelman add nothing original (much less compelling) to our understanding of either business leadership or business success. Consider the nine \\"Lessons\\" they only briefly discuss in the Epilogue:<br />1. Recognize and manage the assets we already have.<br />2. Assume responsibility.<br />3. Consider credibility the most valuable corporate and personal equity, yet most vulnerable to rapid depreciation.<br />4. Use mergers to compound strengths. Yet realize that, to pay dividends, the bonds between the partners must be both strong and flexible.<br />5. Consider personnel selection to be as critical in choosing friends in life as it is in finding bosses, colleagues, and subordinates in business.<br />6. Appreciate how human frailties and failings should inspire tolerance and a desire to help associates realize their full potential.<br />7. Brace for a crisis and recover as quickly as possible.<br />8. Practice fiscal responsibility.<br />9. Prize reputation as the core competency in the accounting of corporate and personal life.<br />Granted, I have quoted these Lessons out of context but the fact is, none really has much of a context; moreover, they are the key points which Augustine and Adelman (not I) emphasize. I urge those interested in Elizabeth I to read the two books about her mentioned earlier. Also, to read several of Shakespeare's greatest plays (let's say, Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth) and then, perhaps, an authoritative commentary such as McElroy's Shakespeare's Mature Tragedies. Having done so, any reasonably intelligent person should be able to recognize the nature and extent of relevant correlations between the Age of Elizabeth (exemplified by but by no means limited to the works of Shakespeare) and our own. My view is that we do not read the works of authors such as Shakespeare to gain a better understanding of business leadership; rather, to gain a better understanding of human nature and, thereby, of ourselves.

The title of Fox's is somewhat misleading. Very few executives ever become a CEO. In fact, that's not what his book is really all about. Like Benton, he focuses on \\"the rules for rising to the top of any organization.\\" As Noel Tichy correctly asserts in The Leadership Engine, all organizations (regardless of size or nature) should constantly develop leadership at all levels. His book, Benton's two, and this book can all help executives to develop such leadership; also, to develop leadership skills in those for whom they are responsible.<br />Hemingway once suggested that all great writers \\"have a built-in, shock-proof crap detector.\\" I was reminded of that as I read Fox's book. His is a no-nonsense, cut-to-the-chase, no-BS approach to executive development. Perhaps a few of his readers will become CEOs. Good for them. Most of his readers will not but, thanks to Fox, they will be much better-prepared to support their CEO while helping their associates to increase their own effectiveness in decision-making situations.<br />Fox organizes his material within 75 brief chapters which range from \\"Always Take the Job That Offers More Money\\" to \\"Do Not Get Discouraged by the Idea Killers.\\" In Chapter LXVIII (\\"No Goals, No Glory\\"), for example, he asserts that \\"You must create a yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily `To Do' list. On your `To Do' list, write the things you have to do to reach your goals. On your daily `To Do' list, put some action that will get you closer to your long-range goals. This will keep you targeted.\\" Nothing original here. However, in this instance and throughout the entire book, Fox focuses on what is practical rather than theoretical. I presume to add my own strong support of what I call the \\"The 3Ws Strategy\\": When meeting with associates to prioritize and then plan initiatives, insist on pinning down \\"Who will do what by when.\\"<br />In the Epilogue, Fox observes: \\"Thank you for reading this book. Now, reopen your book to one or two random pages. Put your finger on a section and do what is written. You will be further on your way to becoming CEO.\\" No cutting-edge thinking here but note, again, the emphasis on taking action. Years ago, I became convinced that below the CEO and COO levels, leadership is best defined in terms of initiative. I once helped to plan and implement an \\"electronic suggestion box\\" program for a major corporation. The best suggestion came from a man working in the mailroom who was about to retire: \\"Except for emergencies, why not limit next business day deliveries to emergencies only?\\" That suggestion saved the corporation approximately $200,000 a year. In this instance, the fellow in the mailroom thought like a CEO and recommended a specific initiative.<br />Fox has written a book which can be of immense value to those who aspire to occupy the CEO position but will be of even greater value to all the others whose career aspirations are less ambitious but who correctly sense that their leadership and management skills can become much more effective. Were I a CEO, I would require all of my executives (at least at the middle-to-senior levels) to read Benton's two books as well as Tichy's and Fox's. Then I would schedule what is generally referred to an \\"executive retreat\\" (preferably lasting at least two days and located offsite), with a task force committee having correlated and consolidated in advance the contents of the four books to create an agenda for the program.<br />With school, college, and university graduations rapidly approaching, Fox's book would also make an excellent gift for those interested in a business career.

The national death rate for children fell from 125.1 per 1,000 in 1891 to 15.8 per 1,000 in 1925, mostly thanks to pasteurization.

In this volume, he assembles a wealth of quotations which directly or indirectly affirm the power of attitude; by implication, they also suggest the implications and consequences of what is generally referred to as a \\"negative attitude.\\" In terms of its design and length, this is a \\"small book\\" but in terms of the quality of material provided, it offers substantial value. There are several reasons why I urge executives to purchase this book. First, because many of the quotations may be unfamiliar to them and thus help to stimulate some new ideas, perspectives, etc.; also, it is desirable to have the book near at hand to consult when drafting a speech, letter, e-mail, report, or presentation of some kind; also, to provide a copies of the book as gifts to associates, customers, prospective customers, etc.; and finally, when professional or personal circumstances are especially stressful, to be nourished, comforted, and perhaps even reassured by the values of those who are quoted. Maxwell inserts his own observations throughout the anthology whenever and wherever appropriate. Reading and then re-reading this book will help to create and then sustain a positive mindset, just as regular exercise will ensure physical fitness. Now more than ever, we need both.	2002-03-07

Armstrong III and Marc Singer, respectively) and Net Worth \\"which builds on a number of the themes originally developed\\" in Net.Gain. As Hagel and Armstrong point out, Net.Gain \\"systematically [analyzes] the economic drivers for value creation that exist on networks. It [uses] one particular business model -- the virtual community -- to illustrate the unique capabilities of digital networks and how these might be harnessed to create a substantial business with very attractive economics.\\"<br />The material in Net Worth is carefully organized within three Parts: The New Infomediaries, Entry Strategies, and The Infomediation of Markets. Hagel and Armstrong also provide an Appendix: The Technology Tool Kit, followed by excellent suggestions for further reading. According to Hagel and Singer, \\"We came up with a key insight. Digital networks such as the Internet might for the first time provide the tools necessary for customers to capture information about themselves and to deny vendors access to this information....It became clear that there would be an opportunity for a new kind of business -- we call it `information intermediary' or `infomediary' -- to help customers capture, manage, and maximize the value of this information.\\"<br />Hagel and Singer challenge a number of common views about the Internet: \\"First, we urge senior managers not to view the Internet simply as a way to do the same things cheaper and faster....Second, we reject the notion that the Internet is uniformly leading to disintermediation, creating opportunities for vendors to connect directly with customers while relentlessly eliminating all intermediaries that previously came in the way....Third, we question whether the real value of the Internet is in information access. The Internet instead is a powerful platform for connecting people or businesses with each other, enriched and enhanced by relevant information....Fourth, we are suspicious of claims that the Internet will systematically lower barriers to entry and lead to fragmentation of businesses.\\" These excerpts from the text correctly suggest that (a) Hagel and Singer believe that there are several quite serious misconceptions about the Internet relative to virtual communities and (b) they have quite specific opinions about how best to shape markets at a time when customers determine what the terms of engagement are.<br />They assert (and I wholeheartedly agree) that companies playing the \\"infomediary\\" role are now -- or will soon become -- the custodians, agents, and brokers of customer information, marketing it to businesses (and providing then with access to it) on consumers' behalf, while at the same time (key point) protecting their privacy. In the final chapter, Hagel and Singer observe that \\"This book has argued that infomediaries can play an extremely valuable market role in reconciling the tension between the growing value of customer information and the growing concern over customer privacy....[Over time] infomediaries will reshape firms and markets. In doing so, they will unleash broad social changes and call into question many conventional approaches to public policy. Our response to these social and public policy issues will in many respects determine the pace and the ultimate effects of this innovative new business model.\\" It is probably impossible to calculate the full value of what Hagel and Singer provide in this single volume. Theirs is a stunning achievement.<br />Beyond its obvious implications for multi-national enterprise, the concept of \\"infomediation\\" may well be the defining principle of global connectivity and interactivity for decades to come. My strong recommendation is that Net.Gain be read first, then Net Worth. My further recommendation is that both books be used to formulate the agenda for a workshop or what is generally referred to as an \\"executive retreat\\" (preferably for two days and located offsite) with all participants required to read both books in advance. Those who share my high regard for the two books are urged to check out Peter Senge's The Fifth Discipline as well as O'Dell and Grayson's If Only We Knew What They Know.

The human toll of September 11 was just the beginning. Virtually every sector is now being hit with breathtaking drops in earnings. No wonder you'll find in these pages recurring themes like productivity, assets, and ROIs.\\" Jensen's purpose is to \\"take the People vs. Profits to a completely new level. To change the lens you use and change the solutions you consider even as you fight for your very survival.\\" In essence, what is Work 2.0? Jensen advocates four \\"Four Forces of Creative Destruction\\" which enable enlightened self-interest to focus on productivity by taking respect for the individual to completely new levels:<br />1. :Asset Revolution: \\"Workforce assets include their time, attention, ideas, skills, knowledge, passion, energy, social networks, and more. How will you create better ROIs on these assets?\\"<br />2. Build My Work My Way: \\"The future of work is personalized and tailored. Information flows, tools, and compensation structures will be personalized so that people can have more control over their own destiny.\\"<br />3. Deliver Peer-to-Peer Value: \\"Nobody needs companies to help them collaborate, share, understand, or create. people can self-organize and connect amazingly well, thank you. You're the middleman. What value do you add when peers connect?\\"<br />4. Develop Extreme Leaders: \\"The future of leadership is extreme accountability for life's precious assets. From this point forward, R-E-S-P-E-C-T includes better use of the assets the workforce brings with them.\\"<br />According to Jensen, there is a \\"New Coin of the Realm\\" for a new work contract. He identifies 20 Articles which range from \\"Our working capital gets stuff done\\" to \\"Work 2.0 value starts with me.\\" In the Work 2.0 world, the most effective organizations will be meritocracies. Those involved will agree upon a combination of the 20 Articles (all, most or only some) which are most relevant to their individual as well as collective needs and interests. Those in the workforce will demand an ROI acceptable to them; the nature and extent of their personal success will determine the nature and extent of producing more sooner and at less cost; motivated by enlightened self-interest, their passion will drive innovation and productivity; their peer-to-peer connections (both within and beyond the organization) will deliver personal freedom, growth, and success; they will measure only what they value; in the world of Work 2.0, there will be greater trust and clarity as well as more effective communication between and among those involved; finally, each participant will assume responsibility for -- and be held accountable to -- much higher standards because, in the world of Work 2.0, the standards are determined by those in the workforce. The ROI of each will be diminished by another's failure to meet those standards.<br />Gary Hamel has written a book in which he urges his readers to \\"lead the revolution.\\" At one point, he observes: \\"This is a book about innovation -- not in the usual sense of new products and new technologies, but in the sense of radical new business models. It begins by laying out the revolutionary imperative: we've reached the end of incrementalism, and only those companies that are capable of creating industry revolutions will prosper in the new economy. It then provides a detailed blueprint of what you [italics] can do to get the revolution started in your own company. Finally, it describes in detail an agenda for making innovation as ubiquitous a capability as quality or customer service. Indeed, my central argument is that radical innovation the [italics] competitive advantage for the new millennium.\\" His is an excellent book which I hold in very high regard. Those who share my admiration of Jensen's two books, Simplicity and Work 2.0, are urged tocheck out Hamel's book. Both Hamel and Jensen challenge what Jim O'Toole  correctly characterizes as \\"the despotism of custom\\" and \\"the ideology of comfort.\\" Anyone in any organization (regardless of size or nature) who has attempted to be a change leader is already familiar with both.<br />Jensen does indeed focus on essentials in Work 2.0. \\"The new war for talent will be fought over who provides the best returns on investments....The future of work is customized, personalized, and tailored to each individual....bottom-up criteria will drive more and more of your collaboration budgets and strategies....The future of leadership includes greater accountability for performance through greater willingness to be challenged on, and address, work-level details.\\" Have he, Hamel, O'Toole and others come up with all the right answers? Of course not. But they have raised all the right questions and then responded to them with precision, passion,  and eloquence. How will you respond? I conclude by presuming to suggest that if your response is essentially irrelevant in your current organization, find another in which the robust spirit and muscular practice of Work 2.0 principles are essential.check out Hamel's book.

(I use the word \\"organizations\\" because non-profits as well as for-profits obviously need to increase revenue while strengthening relations with various constituencies.) Don't expect to find any cutting-edge thinking here. Because the material is basic, however, don't think that Luther has little of value to offer to marketing, sales, and other customer service professionals with many years of experience. He organizes the material within five Parts:<br />The Role of Marketing Within a Business<br />Decisions to Be Made Before Developing Your Marketing Plan<br />Developing Your Brand Personality<br />Developing Your Marketing Plan<br />Feedback: Using Controls and Market Research to Complete the Loop<br />Luther then provides three excellent appendices: A Marketing Plan Outline, Thirty-Eight Market Characteristics, and Explanation of the What-If Sales Model.  I highly recommend this book to owners/managers of chain franchises (e.g. dry cleaners, quick-print shops, and even fast food restaurants) as well as to independent insurance agents, sole practicioner attorneys, and others selling goods or services who generally neglect business development among their clientele within their local community. Presumably Luther understands that much of his material will not be directly relevant to a given reader. To his credit, he provides more material than most readers need. It remains for each reader to determine which ideas and initiatives are most appropriate. I think all readers will benefit from the disciplined thinking which Luther advocates throughout the planning, implementation, evaluation, and modification process. Those who wish to explore additional resources are urged to check out Theodore Levitt's The Marketing Imagination (a \\"classic\\"), Al Ries and Jack Trout's Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind (another\\" classic\\"), Neil Rackham's SPIN Selling (another \\"classic\\", especially for those selling big ticket items), Jacques Werth's High Probability Selling: Re-Invents the Selling Process, Dan Seidman's The Death of 20th Century Selling: 50 Hilarious Sales Blunders and How You Can Profit from Them, and Carl Sewell's Customers for Life: How to Turn That One-Time Buyer into a Lifetime Customer...Battle for Your Mind (another\\" classic\\"), Neil Rackham's SPIN Selling (another \\"classic\\", especially for those selling big ticket items), Jacques Werth's High Probability Selling: Re-Invents the Selling Process, Dan Seidman's The Death of 20th Century Selling: 50 Hilarious Sales Blunders and How You Can Profit from Them, and Carl Sewell's Customers for Life: How to Turn That One-Time Buyer into a Lifetime Customer...	2002-03-05

Hagel and Armstrong also provide a \\"Management Agenda\\", followed by excellent suggestions for further reading.<br />In the Preface, Hagel and Armstrong acknowledge three inevitable limitations in writing Net.Gain: \\"The first arises from the profound uncertainties associated with evolving electronic networks and the myriad business models emerging in the primordial brew known as cycberspace....Second, the need to be concise has led us to make some generalizations about the likely evolution of virtual communities and the key principles for success....Third, we do not expect virtual communities to be the only 'form of life' on public networks. Indeed, many other commercial and non-commercial formats (including dictionaries, market spaces, 'web'zines,' corporate sites and game areas) will thrive on these networks as well.\\" Working within these limitations, Hagel and Armstrong succeed admirably when describing the power and potential of the virtual community concept. Also, when explaining (a) how to target the kind of community to start-up; (b) the principles of a successful entry strategy, emphasizing the need to generate, engage, and lock in traffic over time; (c) characteristics of community organizations; and (d) criteria by which to select the right technology. Then in Part Three, Hagel and Armstrong shift their attention to explaining the fundamental ways in which the emergence and spread of virtual communities will alter traditional business.<br />My strong recommendation is that this book be read first, then Net Worth. My further recommendation is that both books be used to formulate the agenda for a workshop or what is generally referred to as an \\"executive retreat\\" (preferably for two days and located offsite) with all participants required to read both books in advance. In their Epilogue, Hagel and Armstrong suggest that \\"the most radical potential impact of the virtual community may well be its impact on the way individuals manage their lives and companies manage themselves.

1633704:US	51147790	R1MK5IJJW8BSP8	0969499663	848953497	How to Make a Million Dollar First Impression	Books	5	26	27	N	N	Fair or Not, That's the Way It Is	For many readers, this could well prove to be the most valuable book they have read in recent years. Why? Because Goldman and Smythe address a number of issues which frequently determine whether or not an ambitious person succeeds or fails in creating opportunities to pursue her or his career objectives. Do not be misled by the heavy emphasis on the importance of first impressions. Fair or not, unfavorable first impressions are almost always permanent impressions and there may never be second impressions. As Goldman and Smythe explain with meticulous care, almost all unfavorable impressions could have been avoided. I think they would agree with me that favorable first impressions soon prove worthless if they are the result of deception or hypocrisy. Their focus is correctly on common-sense preparations to make favorable first impressions which are authentic and can serve as a \\"bridge\\" to subsequent relationship development.<br />All of us have had extensive experience with those whom I call \\"dazzlers.\\" You know the type. They have mastered all of what Goldman and Smythe recommend. Their first impressions are not only favorable but luminescent but prove (as we eventually discover) too good to be true. I suspect the title of this book was selected for marketing purposes. Ignore the title. The book is really not about monetary values or objectives. Rather, as already indicated, it is about doing everything possible (with integrity) to progress beyond an initial encounter. In other words, to \\"stay in the game\\" (whatever the game may be) and thereby to be able to \\"take your best shot\\" (whatever the target may be). The narrative is especially well-written. The advice is anchored in a wealth of real-world experience. And the 18 \\"Gold Nuggets\\" distributed throughout the 20 Parts are eminently practical.<br />For example, in Chapter 3, Goldman and Smythe cite research which suggests that first impressions are based on the following criteria:<br />53 percent is visual (e.g. physical appearance and body language)<br />38 percent is tone of voice<br />7 percent is what we actually say<br />Quarrel with the percentages but the implications are undeniable. I have examined other research data which suggest that, during a telephone conversation, tone of voice has 4-5 times more impact during an initial contact than does what is actually said. Once again, the implications are undeniable. Goldman and Smythe even include a section (Part 19) which discusses \\"Techno-etiquette: communication in the electronic age\\" and explain how to use a cell phone without annoying people around you, how to make your FAX correspondence flawless, why your e-mail may be fast but shouldn't be sloppy, and what the e-mail do's and don'ts are to be \\"techno-savvy.\\"<br />Obviously, I think very highly of this book. Everyone can derive substantial benefit from it but it will be especially valuable to those now completing their education who are beginning to interview for jobs; also, to those involved in sales or customer service; also, to those well into a career who need assistance with effective networking while exploring opportunities elsewhere; finally, to those who feel they are taken for granted, under appreciated, perhaps even invisible. in their current position. Goldman and Smythe can help anyone to create opportunities which, without favorable and authentic first impressions, would otherwise be in inaccessible. If you have no need of their assistance, buy the book for those who do. They will be favorably impressed and forever grateful.physical appearance and body language)<br />38 percent is tone of voice<br />7 percent is what we actually say<br />Quarrel with the percentages but the implications are undeniable.

Months ago, I had read and then reviewed Downes and Mui's Unleashing the Killer App in which they define a \\"killer application\\" as \\"a new good or service that establishes an entirely new category and, by being first, dominates it, returning several hundred percent on the initial investment.\\" The primary forces at work in spawning today's \\"killer apps\\" are both technological and economic in nature. \\"The technology we are concerned with is the transformation of information into digital form, where it can be manipulated by computers and transmitted by networks.\\" Digital strategies are needed to achieve market dominance.<br />What Sanders has in mind combines some of these core concepts with what Rosen explains so brilliantly in The Anatomy of Buzz. In the Foreword to that book, Everett M. Rogers observes, \\"New products and services spread among the consumer public through interpersonal communication networks. These networks are for the most part invisible. They often operate in mysterious ways. Thus we are largely blind to this very powerful marketing process. No wonder that we fail so often in our efforts to diffuse innovations.\\"<br />As I understand what Sanders is about, he wants to convince as many people as possible that love (like a new good or service) can be a decisive, indeed dominant force in human relationships. Moreover, within a business context, it can return \\"several hundred percent on the initial investment.\\" Agreeing with Rosen, Sanders also asserts that after people become what he calls a \\"lovecat\\" by completing a three-step process, they can then involve others through \\"interpersonal communication networks.[that] are for the most part invisible. They often operate in mysterious ways. Thus we are largely blind to this very powerful marketing process. No wonder that we fail so often in our efforts to diffuse innovations.\\"<br />Do not conclude (incorrectly) that Sanders is hopelessly naive, romantic, idealistic, etc. When explaining the three-step process to become a \\"lovecat\\", he reveals a rock-solid grasp of what are generally referred as the \\"harsh realities\\" of a ferociously competitive business world, one in which change is the only constant, where it's dog eat dog, blah blah blah. Sanders understands all that. Indeed, such descriptives help to suggest precisely why love can have so much \\"potency\\" when shared strategically but (key point) unconditionally. Consider this brief excerpt from the Afterword: \\"Being a lovecat is not about being nice. There's no point in playing by these rules if you're not smart, too. Because if you're not, it won't scale, and all you'll have to show for it is good intentions rather than good business relationships. To quote the movie This Is Spinal Tap, `There's a fine line between stupid and clever'\\" Sanders then recalls a sign he once saw hanging on a wall which said \\"Business education without execution is just entertainment.\\"<br />This really is a book about business. More specifically, it is about prospering in business. Even more specifically, it is about prospering in business by doing everything humanly possible to help others (yes, including competitors) to prosper. Sanders' observations are anchored in a wealth of real-world experience. His explanation of the three-step process to lovecathood is crystal clear. His recommendations are sensible, indeed eminently practical. His faith in the power of love is contagious.<br />My guess is that, after reading these brief remarks, those who are least interested in experiencing (not just reading) this book are the same people who are in greatest need of what it shares. You know who you are. Why not discover who you can become and also how you can help others to fulfill their own potential for compassion? Sanders is eager to help you to complete that exciting journey.lessly naive, romantic, idealistic, etc. When explaining the three-step process to become a \\"lovecat\\", he reveals a rock-solid grasp of what are generally referred as the \\"harsh realities\\" of a ferociously competitive business world, one in which change is the only constant, where it's dog eat dog, blah blah blah.

As the media continue to examine allegations of child abuse and domestic violence, it is imperative to remember that those accused are innocent until found guilty beyond reasonable doubt after legal due process. Nonetheless, even in that event, those exonerated may have by then already been severely punished socially, economically, and psychologically by the discredited allegations. What could and should the falsely accused have done to protect themselves? Tong answers that critically important question in this book. Also, a separate but related question: What can anyone do in advance to minimize the risk of being victimized later by false allegations? As my three sons were growing up, I helped to coach the teams on which they played. For many years, my wife and I were also directly involved in various social activities which included friends of our sons and daughter (e.g. birthday parties, matinee movies, cook-outs, sleep-overs, picnics, trips to the zoo) during which we were potentially vulnerable to false accusations of \\"improper behavior.\\" I realized this as I read Tong's book. I also thought about Arthur Miller's play The Crucible, based on the Salem witch trials in the late-1th century. Wholly innocent persons were found guilty and punished (in some instances executed) because of false accusations by children.<br />Please understand that I have zero tolerance of physical abuse in any form, be it of children, spouses or anyone else. Those found guilty of such abuse should be punished to the full limit of the law. Tong agrees. His book was written to assist those falsely accused; it was also written to assist everyone else who may be vulnerable to false accusations; finally, it was written to assist others who, in his words, \\"fall victim to, champion, and don't understand the 71 percent unfounded and false cases of alleged child abuse and neglect. This is what I call the reverse cycle of child abuse.\\" (Note: In his Introduction, Tong points out that there were one million confirmed reports of child abuse and neglect in 1998. Of these, approximately 71% were unfounded and false.) During the course of his book, Tong carefully examines actual case studies to stimulate his reader's \\"gray matter regarding the suggestibility of young children's disclosures of abuse, usage of anatomically exaggerated dolls, and inherent problems facing our social work, mental health, and legal professions.\\"<br />Tong is to be commended for making a substantial contribution to our understanding of the scope and depth of a problem which has created so many victims and done so much damage. His book will be especially valuable to parents, of course, but also to all others who have any contact whatsoever with children (e.g. teachers, coaches, clergy) as well as to healthcare, legal, and social service professionals who may be called upon when there is any suspicion of child or spousal abuse.<br />Today I am a grandparent, proud and pleased that my three sons are involved in the athletic and social activities of their own children. I dread the thought and resent the possibility that one or more of these fine young men (indeed any other fine young women as well as men) could become victims of false accusations.

Of these, approximately 71% were unfounded and false.) During the course of his book, Tong carefully examines actual case studies to stimulate his reader's \\"gray matter regarding the suggestibility of young children's disclosures of abuse, usage of anatomically exaggerated dolls, and inherent problems facing our social work, mental health, and legal professions.\\"<br />Tong is to be commended for making a substantial contribution to our understanding of the scope and depth of a problem which has created so many victims and done so much damage. His book will be especially valuable to parents, of course, but also to all others who have any contact whatsoever with children (e.g. teachers, coaches, clergy) as well as to healthcare, legal, and social service professionals who may be called upon when there is any suspicion of child or spousal abuse.<br />Today I am a grandparent, proud and pleased that my three sons are involved in the athletic and social activities of their own children.

Recently, the 4th edition of this book was published and I have read it but see no reason to change any of my original review. This latest edition has some new material, notably the inclusion of more cases from outside the United States. Also, as Kouzes and Posner explain in their Preface, \\"we did decide we needed to go on a diet. Each succeeding edition tended to put on a little weight -- feature creep, as they say in the technology business.\\" For those who are curious to know, nothing in the co-authors' continuing research since the first edition has as yet revealed a \\"magical sixth practice that will revolutionize the practice of leadership.\\"<br /><br />  *  *  *  *  *<br /><br />I recently re-read this brilliant book before proceeding to Kouzes and Posner's more recently published Encouraging the Heart. I highly recommend both and suggest that they be read in the order in which they were written. Those of us who presume to review books such as this one can merely indicate their breadth and depth of substance as well as their stimulation of thought about the material presented. For example, Kouzes and Posner identify what they call \\"five leadership practices common to successful leaders\\" and then suggest ten \\"behavioral commitments\\" among those leaders studied. Here they are:<br /><br />Practice: Challenge the process<br />Commitments: (1) Search for opportunities and (2) Experiment and take risks<br /><br />Practice: Inspire a shared vision<br />Commitments:  (3) Envision the future and (4) Enlist others<br /><br />Practice: Enable others to act<br />Commitments: (5) Foster collaboration and (6) Strengthen others<br /><br />Practice: Model the way to the desired objectives<br />Commitments: (7) Set the example and (8) Plan small wins<br /><br />Practice: Encourage the heart of everyone involved<br />Commitments: (9) Recognize individual contribution and (10) Celebrate accomplishments<br /><br />Those who conduct \\"360 Feedback\\" programs could do much worse than to base evaluations on criteria suggested by these practices and commitments. They provide the thematic infrastructure of the material which Kouzes and Posner present within seven Parts. The first introduces key concepts and terms: \\"Knowing What Leadership Is Really All About.\\" Each of Parts Two-Six is devoted to one of the five Practices. Kouzes and Posner conclude with Part Seven, \\"The Beginning of Leadership', followed by two appendices which enable the reader to complete \\"The Personal Best Questionnaire\\" before reviewing \\"The Leadership Practices Inventory.\\"<br /><br />There are dozens of outstanding books on leadership and this is one of the best. I am especially impressed by the balance Kouzes and Posner maintain throughout between theory and practice. More specifically, they introduce and explain various core concepts and then draw upon real-world situations to illustrate those concepts. Obviously, \\"Encouraging the Heart\\" (Part Six) introduces ideas which Kouzes and Posner develop in much greater depth in a sequel volume which bears the same name. They conclude this book as follows: \\"We have said that leaders take us to places we have never been before. But there are no freeways to the future, no paved highways to unknown, unexplored destinations. There is only wilderness.

After introducing and then discussing  five &quot;leadership practices common to successful leaders\\" and ten &quot;behavioral commitments\\" among those leaders studied iwhile preparing to write The Leadership Challenge, Kouzes and Posner focus on recognizing contributions (i.e. linking rewards with performance) and celebrating accomplishments (i.e. valuing the victories) in Part Six. In this volume, these two \\"leadership commitments\\" receive their full attention. The material is carefully organized within 12 chapters which range from \\"The Heart of Leadership\\" to \\"150 Ways to Encourage the Heart.\\" Why did they write this book? There are four reasons.<br />Practicality: \\"We wanted to offer a set of principles, practices, and examples that would provide leaders with a repeatable process -- a set of essential actions --they could apply in their own settings.\\"<br />Principle: \\"In this book, we not only demonstrate that encouraging the heart is not soft; we show how powerful a force it is in achieving high standards and stretch goals.\\"<br />Curiosity: \\"We've been intrigued for some time by this finding that] \\"female constituents do not report that their leaders encourage the heart any more than do male constituents, regardless of the gender of their leader] and we wanted to explore the practice in depth to see if we could understand more about these differences.\\"<br />Finally, \\"...because we wanted to add our voices to the discussion of soul and spirit in the workplace.\\"<br />Kouzes and Posner note that the word \\"encouragement\\" has its root in the Latin word \\"cor\\" which literally means \\"heart.\\" (So does the word \\"courage.\\") To have courage is to have heart. To encourage -- to provide with or give courage -- literally means to give others heart. For me, there are at least three especially important core concepts: First, love what you do. Love those for whom you are responsible. And love them enough to set high standards for them and then give them hope that you and they can meet those standards. Second, don't think of leadership in terms of position, title, power, status, etc. Rather, think of it in terms of initiative. Encourage, recognize and reward initiative whenever and wherever you find it throughout your entire organization. Third and finally, practice what you preach and do that every day. The most effective leaders care....and care deeply. They have credibility because their values and behavior are in unshakable alignment. They have earned others' trust.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out David Maister's Practice What You Preach, Tim Sanders' Love Is the Killer App, David Whyte's The Heart Aroused, and Larry Davis' Pioneering Organizations.to give others heart.

However, there is another death which can be denied: The death which occurs when we become wholly preoccupied with fulfilling others' expectations of us. Vincent Roazzi agrees. In this remarkable book, he candidly reviews his life and shares the lessons he has learned from it thus far. Born and raised in Brooklyn, he joined a gang and became a car thief. Later, he became involved with family-owned businesses and enjoyed great financial success. By age 32, he had become addicted to cocaine and gambling. His addictions threatened his marriage and his relations with five children. He was broke and on welfare. At age 36, he decided that he had two choices: enter a rehabilitation program or commit suicide. He chose the former and began to rebuild his life. Eventually, he became wealthy as a salesperson with the Cornerstone organization with which he continues to share what he has learned about personal development and professional achievement. He has paid a substantial \\"tuition\\" for the \\"education\\" gained over several decades of both success and failure. Like most other people, he seems to have learned the most valuable lessons from his failures. The most important of these lessons -- directly or indirectly -- reveal and indeed celebrate the importance of spiritual nourishment. The title of the book correctly indicates how important spiritual values are to Roazzi. For him, the most successful people are those who have gained much of what the material world has to offer without losing their soul. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read Maister's Practice What You Preach, Whyte's The Heart Aroused, and Sanders' Love Is the Killer App.	2002-03-01

He describes his book as \\"the biography of an idea\\", a simple idea: the best way to understand the emergence of all major social, economic, or political forces (what Kuhn and then Barker call a \\"paradigm shift\\") \\"is to think of them as epidemics. Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread just like viruses do.\\" But first they must be activated, set in motion, more often than not by what Gladwell characterizes as a \\"little thing.\\" In the Conclusion of his book, Gladwell suggests: \\"Look at the world around you. It may seem like an immovable, implacable place. It is not. With the slightest push -- in just the right place -- it can be tipped.\\" He offers an abundance of examples. As I read the book, and began to grasp this concept, I thought of Isaac Newton and his alleged encounter with a falling apple. Also of Richard III (as portrayed by William Shakespeare) who lost a kingdom because his horse lost a shoe. You get the idea. Tipping points can occur almost anywhere at any time. Most of us fail to recognize them because of what I call \\"the invisibility of the obvious.\\" They can be the result of many different factors which, in combination, can sometimes change the course of history. During the next few years, my guess is that progressively more tipping points will occur and at progressively greater velocity but that they will reveal themselves not as windows of opportunity but as blinks of a strobe light. Those who see them and then know what to do about them will probably have a decisive competitive advantage, if not dominate the world they survey.	2002-03-01

Also timely. Maxwell focuses on three key objectives: Developing leadership within one's self (discussed in greater depth in his book Developing the Leader Within You), developing leadership within associates, and thereby maximizing the potential of all human assets within any organization, regardless of its size or nature. Maxwell has a tendency to re-cycle essentially the same ideas from one book to the next but all of them are sound. My own opinion is that the scope and depth of Noel Tichy's The Leadership Engine are greater and hence more valuable than Maxwell's in this volume. However, not damning with faint praise, this is a book which will probably be well-received by middle managers who are encouraged to read it by their supervisors. As for those supervisors, I think the severely limited time available to them for discretionary reading is best allocated elsewhere. My own recommendations to them include the aforementioned book by Tichy, Hamer's The Agenda, Buckingham and Coffman's First, Break All the Rules, O'Toole's Leading Change, Fitz-enz's The ROI of Human Capital, and The Essential Drucker.	2002-03-01

The material is organized within four sections, each of which is a \\"Keystone\\" of human fulfillment: Trust, Energy, Farsightedness, and Nerve. No brief commentary such as this can do full justice to the scope and depth of the \\"journey\\" of self-exploration which Cooper urges his reader to take. However, it may be helpful if I share these brief but representative excerpts. First, Cooper asserts that each of us has three separate but interdependent \\"brains\\", each of which he analyzes. \\"From a practical standpoint, reaching the peak of your true potential depends on developing and apply an energizing, authentic level of intelligence and bringing it to everything you do. For this to happen, you must combine the perceptions and impressions of the gut, heart, and mind.\\" To conclude his book, Cooper shares a poem he wrote for his and others' children:<br />\\"...To lead by example,<br />Love as if you will live forever,<br />Work as if you have no need for money,<br />Dream as if no one can say no,<br />Have fun as if you never have to grow up,<br />Sing as if no one else is listening,<br />Care as if everything depends on your caring,<br />And raise a banner where a banner never flew.\\"<br />With both precision and eloquence, Cooper offers a variety of strategies and tactics to establish and then strengthen the four \\"Keystones\\" and, in process he suggests how to fulfill at least much (if not all) of the potential of each of the three \\"brains\\" (gut, heart, and mind). It remains for each reader to absorb and digest all this in ways and to the extent she or he deems appropriate. Ultimately, each reader must embark on what is certain to be a difficult journey to personal fulfillment. In some respects, it is inevitably a solitary journey. But in other respects, it will be guided and informed by what Cooper has so generously shared in this book.

Perhaps you have read What If? which limits its attention to hypothetical situations throughout military history. In this sequel, Cowley assembles 25 speculative commentaries on both military and non-military situations. Their authors are either eminent historians or thoughtful non-scholars. They understand far better than most of their readers do what the limitations of such \\"What if?\\" speculations are. Heaven knows they are entertaining. Great fun indeed. But they also have substantial educational value because they are relentlessly thought-provoking. The erudition and intelligence of their authors also give them some degree of credibility: If indeed Pontius Pilate had spared Jesus or Adolph Hitler had been brought to trial after World War II ended, it is highly likely (or at least plausible) that what Carlos M.N. Eire and Roger Spiller hypothesize would in fact have happened pretty much as they suggest. Tom Wicker is the author of \\"If Lincoln Had Not Freed the Slaves\\" and makes abundant sense when delineating the probable impact on American history. Geoffrey C. Ward takes a somewhat different approach in \\"The Luck of Franklin Delano Roosevelt\\" as he exams seven \\"might-not-have-beens\\" on FDR's path to the presidency. Crowley provides a superb preface to each of the commentaries, followed by a brief biography of its author. With 25 different commentaries spanning almost 2,500 years, there is literally something for everyone. One word of caution: Do not avoid commentaries on subjects in which you now have little (if any) interest. You may well find them to be the most informative as well as most enjoyable to read...no matter which ones they may be. Congratulations again to Cowley for another commendable achievement.	2002-03-01

Bell correctly points out that this book \\"provides a new framework for helping enterprises combine the synergy of the team with the conviction of the individual. It offers leaders a deeply grounded philosophy and practice of how to galvanize vision, unearth spirit, and channel courage in a fashion that forges contribution.\\" Throughout his book, Davis explains how to create and then sustain a strong convergence of individualism and teamwork -- teamwork built on healthy self-interest -- and leadership that encourages the contributions of both. He carefully organizes his material within three Parts: An Exploration into Pioneering Organizations, Creating Pioneering Organizations for the 21st Century, and Appendices: Pioneering Tales which examine four quite different organizations (Vignette Corporation, the IC2 Institute, the Post Ranch Inn, and Starbucks). All four exemplify the five \\"pioneering principles\\" previously explained in depth. These principles are: a pioneering vision, a convergence of (self) interests, interdependent individualism, teamwork as aligned individualism, and finally, convergent leadership. One of the book's most useful sections is \\"The Organization Convergence and Commitment Checklist\\" (included in Chapter 7) which consists of questions which each organization must consider while addressing business, individual, teamwork, trust, and process issues.<br />One theme which Davis develops throughout his book is the increasingly important need not only to to preserve life but to \\"find new ways to nurture the quality of life.\\" He affirms the value of various benefits created by \\"the speeding enterprises of the information world\\" even as we must do everything humanly possible to preserve the planet by pioneering the common good with convergent leadership. We must regain control (in common purpose) of the human \\"agenda\\", indeed to \\"rescue it from the clutches of the selfish few and their paid politicians.\\" Another important theme (previously but only briefly indicated in this review) is what is generally referred to as \\"enlightened self-interest.\\" That is to say, the most effective organizations, the \\"pioneering organizations\\" featured in Davis' book (including the four discussed in the appendices), illustrate a profitable and sustainable convergence of principled individualism with divergent priorities. The latter could well include \\"increased global understanding, mutual respect [between and among nations], and perhaps eventually world peace.\\"<br />Who will derive the greatest value from this book? Primarily, I think, decision-makers in organizations within which there is a compelling, on-going need to combine the synergy of the team with the conviction of the individual. I agree with Davis that \\"the interdependent balancing of the interests of the individual with those of the group and community may have been the secret of pioneer America's economic success.\\" That is even more true now than ever before. An individual with vision and determination in combination with effective teamwork can create a \\"dynamic tension which explains the energy and industry\\" of all pioneering cultures throughout the world. That may well be the \\"key\\" to both prosperity and peace.

They do not advocate the total elimination of these boundaries (which is impossible, anyway); rather,  they suggest how to rearrange them so that an organization can thrive. For the authors, there is what they call \\"A New World Order\\":<br />&quot;In living organisms, membranes exist to give the organization shape and definition. They have sufficient structural strength to prevent the organism from dissolving into an amorphous mess....Like a living organism, the boundaryless organization also evolves and grows, and the placement of boundaries may shift....Because the boundaryless organization is a living continuum, not a fixed state, the ongoing management challenge is to find the  right balance of boundaryless behavior, to determine how permeable to make boundaries, and where to place them.&quot;<br />This brief excerpt from the first chapter correctly suggests the purpose of this remarkable book: To explain HOW to meet that challenge. The material is presented within four parts plus a conclusion. The first explains how to achieve \\"free movement up and down\\" by crossing vertical boundaries; the second explains how to achieve \\"free movement side to side\\" by crossing horizontal boundaries; the third explains how to achieve \\"free movement along the value chain\\" by crossing external boundaries; and in the fourth part, they explain how to achieve \\"free global movement\\" by crossing geographic boundaries.\\" Then in the Conclusion, the authors discuss \\"Making It Happen: Leading Toward the Boundaryless Organization.\\"  The authors also include a series of six questionnaires. By completing each in sequence, the reader is able to determine (a) where her or his organization is now located relative to \\"the boundaryless paradigm\\", and (b), what is needed to eliminate the \\"gap\\" between where it is now and where it should be.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read The Boundaryless Organization Field Guide.

1663414:US	51147790	R1NLBFYEJGUS0D	0971291101	545808629	The Death of 20th Century Selling	Books	5	20	21	N	N	Invaluable Learning Opportunities	Presumably the salespersons involved did not find their blunders \\"hilarious.\\" Hopefully, they learned something of value from them. Seidman has written a book about 50 \\"blunders\\" and then helps his reader to understand how to benefit from them. Each situation is followed by a brief \\"Postmortem.\\" Seidman correctly suggests that his book not be read non-stop from beginning to end but I suggest that you skim read it, locking in on those specific situations which correlate with your own experiences. One of his most important points is that every salesperson makes \\"blunders\\" and each is a learning opportunity. His book enables readers to learn from the mistakes of others which range from not listening carefully to refusing to accept \\"Yes\\" as an answer. No single book on the general subject of salesmanship can possibly address all issues and all situations, much less provide definitive guidance on which strategies and tactics are most appropriate.<br />When I devise and then conduct what are necessarily \\"customized\\" sales training workshops, I first learn all I can about the specific marketplace in which the participants compete. Also, I learn as much as I can about the individual participants. Another important point which Seidman reiterates throughout the book is the importance of credibility which, really, is determined by the authenticity of a salesperson. Obviously, it is important to be fully-informed about the functions, features, and benefits of whatever is offered for sale. However, people do or do not  \\"buy\\" the salesperson before agreeing to a purchase. Therefore, being (and being perceived to be) sincerely interested in the prospect's needs as well as the needs of the prospect's organization is of paramount importance. Their styles and skill levels may vary but all effective salespersons come across as being authentic (because they are) and thus the given prospect trusts them.<br />Near the end of his book, Seidman observes that: \\"The term system [italics] refers to the use of a model that copies the success of others. The system tells us what to say at the beginning of each sales call. It shows us the path to follow when encountering tough prospects, handling objections, filling out paperwork, even planning the pieces of each workday -- like the times we do phone calling and when we have face-to-face appointments.\\" It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of having a system, whatever its specifics may be. For decades, salespersons at IBM were not only urged to \\"THINK\\": they were also required to plan their work and then work their plan. For Seidman, an evangelist of discipline and structure as well as of passion and enthusiasm, the purpose of a sales plan is to insure predictability. Specifically, Seidman explains, \\"It duplicates successful behavior. It disqualifies bad prospects quickly. It employs strategies that allow you, not the prospect, to control the sales process.\\"<br />For whatever reasons, \\"blunders\\" are inevitable and thus to be expected...but NOT repeated. Much can be learned from the real-world situations which Seidman shares; also from the various \\"Postmortems\\" he adds. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Rackham's SPIN Selling (especially valuable to those selling \\"big ticket items\\") and Werth's High Probability Selling (especially valuable to those in retail and B2B sales). To these I add Gitomer's The Sales Bible. Like life itself, salesmanship involves a continuous, indeed constant learning process. Learn as much as you can, as soon as you can, from sources such as these. What you learn from your or (better yet) others' \\"blunders\\" will have even greater value if (huge \\"if\\") you effectively apply the lessons learned.<br />I conclude this review with one caveat. Because buyers have become highly sophisticated, probably because they have such extensive and varied experiences with the selling process, beware of seeming to \\"sell.\\" Seidman's book can be of great value toyou but ultimately it is your responsibility (and no one else's) to prepare for each opportunity with meticulous care, to establish credibility, and then to determine ASAP what the buyer's reasons are (NOT yours) for making a purchase.

(Who knows what the latest Enron and Arthur Andersen developments will be by the time this review appears?) What sets this book apart from almost all others which discuss the same general subject is the fact that Fink's observations, insights, and recommendations are (if anything) more relevant in 2001 than ever before. How can this be true? My answer is that he correctly emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive and cohesive process which consists of four separate but related components: anticipation and preparation, rapid response, follow-through, and post-event evaluation. For obvious reasons, each is critically important but post-event evaluation has even greater importance (and value) if it guides and informs subsequent anticipation and preparation. In an ideal world, seamless anticipation and preparation will eliminate all crises. In reality, \\"the best laid plans\\" can almost instantaneously become irrelevant, if not counter-productive. Presumably, major airlines such as American and United as well as the City of New York (not to mention federal agencies) involved some exceptionally talented people to formulate a number of \\"What if?\\" scenaria. And then the events of September 11th occurred. The efforts to formulate such scenaria were not invalidated by those events; nonetheless, as in Hawaii almost 60 years ago, the challenge was for various corporate and governmental entities to respond immediately and effectively, as indeed they did. In time, as with the events which occurred on December 7th, the events which occurred last September will be evaluated even as preventive measures are taken and new scenaria are formulated, as indeed they should be.<br />Fink organizes his excellent material within 18 chapters which are arranged in a sequence appropriate to the aforementioned components. With meticulous care, he defines various terms (thus providing a nomenclature for crisis management which most readers probably did not have before) while establishing a context within which to illustrate and apply those terms.  Of greater value, I think, is the matrix of different perspectives which Fink provides. This strategy reminds me of the way Henry James develops his major characters in various novels. That is, look at a given situation from every possible angle. This Fink does brilliantly as he explains how to measure the nature and extent of a given crisis, decide who must do what immediately, how to manage information (he devotes Chapters 13 and 14 to crisis communications), and how to make the most effective decisions under what are inevitably severe pressures ranging from shock and fear to grief and anger within compressed timeframes. He also includes what he calls \\"A Catastrophic Quartet\\" in Chapter 17: case studies of crises involving Ohio Savings and Loan, Union Carbide, Procter &amp; Gamble (Rely Tampon), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (Tylenol). Having reached this point in the book, Fink's reader is already well-prepared to recognize various dos and don'ts within the four case studies.<br />Who will derive the greatest value from this book? My response is decision-makers in organizations (regardless of size or nature) who realize or at least suspect the importance of having a crisis management program already in place, especially now. Noteworthy is the fact that the same observations, insights, and recommendations which Fink shares in this book are as relevant to \\"catastrophes\\" involving loss of intellectual property as they are to situations in which there is loss of human life and/or destruction of physical property.  Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Ian Mitroff's Managing Crises Before They Occur and The Essential Guide to Managing Corporate Crises (in that order) as well as Peter Schwartz's The Art of the Long View. The subtitle of this book stresses the importance of \\"planning for the inevitable.\\" I could not agree more.book stresses the importance of \\"planning for the inevitable.\\" I could not agree more.	2002-01-24

They must be entrepreneurs who make their own opportunities -- either within or outside of a major corporation -- or professionals with portable career assets -- skills and reputations that can be applied anywhere.....While the message of this book -- that women are caught in the midst of unprecedented social and economic changes -- will not come as a surprise to women who cope with these upheavals daily, the advice and solutions within can help women grapple with vast changes in their organizations.\\" Then in the Introduction, Nancy A. Nichols asserts that \\"the very first thing that a woman must learn to manage is her femininity. From the moment she enters the work force until the day she leaves the corporate arena, she is judged not just as a manager on the job, but as a woman in the job.\\" For that reason, women find themselves in a \\"double bind\\": those who act like a man are forced to act like a man are forced to act in a \\"sexually dissonant way\\"; those who act in a \\"feminine\\" manner risk being perceived as ineffective, \\"or worse yet, getting trampled on the way to the top.\\"<br />The material is carefully organized within four Parts: Breaking the Double Bind, Fitting In or Fighting Back, The Balancing Act, and Tales from the Front. To her great credit, Nichols has selected a diversity of perspectives. One of the book's greatest strengths is the variety of real-world situations (\\"tales from the front\\" case studies) which illustrate key points. One of the most informative sections is Eliza G.C. Collins' interview with Lore Heap who (literally) launched Vector Graphics on her kitchen table with a $6,000 investment and built it into a $25-million company. As Heap explains, \\"I'm not a feminist....I feel that most women gain acceptance from peers, male or female, by proving integrity and intelligence -- not by talking about job discrimination and all sorts of other complaints. I just don't have time for that.\\" I highly recommend this book to women either in business now or preparing for a business career. Also to the men with whom they will associate. Finally, to the parents, grandparents and other older relatives of young men and young women (especially those now enrolled in colleges and university degree programs) who also need to understand \\"the changing facts of work life.\\"  Hopefully, those who read and then re-read this important book will help to ensure that changes yet to occur are of substantial benefit to everyone, regardless of age or gender.mination and all sorts of other complaints.

Moreover, the editors have selected both information and wisdom which can help to ensure that such a program is comprehensive, cohesive, and cost-effective. The phrase \\"best practices\\" is apt but should not be misconstrued to mean that strategies and tactics which have been highly successful in some organizations are necessary going to be successful in all others. Moreover, I urge the reader to keep in mind that, although the organizations featured (e.g. Boeing, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Kraft Foods, Nortel Networks, ServiceMASTER, SmithKline Beecham, and Sun Microsystems) are among the largest in their respective industries, much of the material in this book is also relevant to small-to-midsize organizations. My own rather extensive past experience with all manner of organizations (including non-profits) has convinced me that most people do not fear change; rather, they fear the unfamiliar. Hence the importance of three on-going initiatives: communicate, communicate, and communicate.<br />Part One consists of Acknowledgments, About This Book, How to Use This Book, and an excellent Foreword by Richard Beckhard.

They are: Business Diagnosis, Assessment, Program Design, Implementation, On-the-Job Support, and Evaluation. It is helpful to keep these six \\"elements\\" clearly in mind while working your way through the abundance of information which the editors provide. Fortunately, they have organized the (sometimes daunting) material with meticulous care and write exceptionally well. I also urge you to use the same six \\"elements\\" as guidelines when determining what the design of your own program for organizational change should be, and, when selecting those strategies and tactics discussed in the book which are most appropriate to the implementation and evaluation of that program.

Many years ago, Voltaire said something to the effect that we should cherish those who seek the truth but beware of those who find it. I was reminded of that caveat as I worked my way through this book. Posner defines a public intellectual as one of those \\"who opine to an educated public on questions of or inflected by a political or ideological concern\\" and asserts that many (most?) contemporary thinkers thus defined become academics and then, over time, specialists in their respective fields. As a result, public issues of various kinds are denied the circumspection they require from those once capable of providing it. In Part Two, Posner claims to substantiate claims made in Part One \\"and goes beyond definition to an explanation of the varied genres of public-intellectual expression, and deals in depth with some of the most interesting and ambitious, and not merely the typical, public intellectuals active in the United States today.\\" He identifies the usual suspects: Robert Bork, Noam Chomsky, Paul Ehrlich, Stanley Fish, Milton Friedman, Stephen Jay Gould, Lani Guinier, Gertrude Himmlefaub, Christopher Lasch, Martha Nussbaum, Richard Rorty, and Michael Warner. He evaluates each, damning with faint praise, praising with faint damnation, or simply dismissing entirely as unworthy of serious consideration. In many instances, Posner suggests, these and other \\"public intellectual\\" wannabes embraced what Posner calls \\"false beliefs\\" (e.g. \\"collectivist public policies\\") and thereby rejected or simply ignored the practical implications and consequences of such convictions. (It is important to keep in mind that Posner sees himself as a \\"pragmatist.\\") Other reviewers have taken issue with Posner's evaluations of various individuals. Some suggest that he  invalidates candidates for a position he himself wishes to occupy: in Gary Rosen's words, \\"king of the public intellectuals.\\" Be that as it may, I found this book to be extraordinarily thought-provoking. It achieves what seems to be one of Posner's primary objectives, expressed in the final chapter: \\"...my hopes for this book will be amply fulfilled if it merely stimulates a wider recognition of the problematic state of the public intellectual in the United States today and encourages further study of an odd and interesting market.\\"ems to be one of Posner's primary objectives, expressed in the final chapter: \\"...my hopes for this book will be amply fulfilled if it merely stimulates a wider recognition of the problematic state of the public intellectual in the United States today and encourages further study of an odd and interesting market.\\"	2002-01-21

Buruma examines various \\"bad elements\\" in China and elsewhere whose intransigence and (in several instances) corruption create serious barriers to communication and cooperation as well as to commerce with the western world. Viewed as a global market, the People's Republic of China offers business opportunities which are almost comprehensible. For those of us in democratic societies in which dissent is not only possible but protected by law, it is difficult to grasp the nature and extent of suppression of human rights which we so easily take for granted. Among dissenters, opinions vary as to the pace of reform by which to establish such rights. At one point in this brilliant book, Buruma discusses Dai Qing who can be described as a \\"go slow intellectual.\\" She advocates patience and prudence, confident of eventual reforms. \\"One sees what she means, but the analysis is flawed. On the contrary, the raw emotions, the latent hysteria, the pent-up aggressions seething under the surface of Chinese life are the result of living a lie. As long as people speak cannot freely, nothing can be exposed to to the light of reason, and raw emotions will take over.\\" Over the centuries, social reform in China has never been easy and often traumatic. After conducting interviews with several dozen \\"mavericks\\" and then reflecting upon what they have shared with him, Buruma seems skeptical that significant social reform can be achieved, given the opposition of various \\"bad elements.\\" He may be right. There is also the possibility that one totalitarian dynasty will simply give way to another. In that event, to what extent will suppression of dissent be sustained? To what extent will such a new dynasty be more willing and able to accommodate new technologies, notably the Internet? Buruma asks these and other critically important questions. He and we await answers which will indeed have global implications: positive, negative, or more likely both.ndeed have global implications: positive, negative, or more likely both.	2002-01-10

They challenge the accuracy of his comments about various negotiations, lawsuits, personnel decisions, etc. No doubt he employs selective memory. No doubt he frequently bends the truth to suit what are often his self-serving purposes. No doubt in several instances he is flat-out wrong. So what? I rate this book so highly because it provides access to Redstone which would otherwise be denied, at least to me. No one can question the nature and extent of his achievements in business. No one can deny that he is among the most controversial of media empire CEOs. The person he himself describes is not someone I would wish to be closely associated with. I do not plan to invite him over for Sunday dinner (although he may well be delightful company in that situation) and I have not included him on my holiday greeting card mailing list. Again, so what? In his own words, he shares with me and other readers his &quot;take&quot; on his life and career thus far. We have his version of volatile relationships with others such as Barry Diller who also bears little resemblance to Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Mr. Redstone, for explaining why you think you have a passion to win; also, what you think the impact of that passion has had in your life.	2002-01-06

According to  Longenecker and Simonetti, there are \\"five absolutes for high performance\\" and they examine each with both precision and eloquence. Few (if any) are original. The most effective managers probably practice them (and others) to achieve superior results. Whichever \\"absolutes\\" are embraced, they are obviously worthless without effective implementation in combination with both a determination and an ability to adjust to circumstances which can change quickly at any time. Here are the five absolutes:<br />#1 Get Everyone on the Same Page: Focus on the Purpose of Your Organization<br />#2 Prepare for Battle: Equip Your Operation with Tools, Talent, and Technology<br />#3 Stoke the Fire of Performance: Create a Climate for Results<br />#4 Build the Bridge on the Road to Results: Nurture Relationships with People<br />#5 Keep the Piano in Tune: Practice Continuous Renewal<br />No doubt each reader can easily rephrase each of the five or at least cluster several synonyms which suggest each absolute's key point. For example, #1 suggests the importance of agreement (or consensus) on which teamwork always depends whereas #5 suggests the importance of constant attention to the progress of any initiatives so that appropriate modifications can be made. The Japanese word \\"kaizen\\" means more than continuous renewal; those involved in such efforts must always be aware of maintaining proper balance (or proportion), especially when responding to a crisis of some kind.<br />For whom will this book be most valuable? The authors wrote it for \\"managers at all levels who are looking for ways to improve the performance not only of themselves but also of the people they are directly responsible for.\\" I presume to suggest that this book would also be valuable to recent graduates who have only recently begun a business career. Every organization (including non-profits and family-owned businesses) needs to have an easily understood system (as well as sound strategies) by which to achieve the desired results. Longenecker and Simonetti provide such a system in this book. It remains for decision-makers, especially,  \\"at all levels\\" to modify the system to their organization's specific needs and objectives. In the Afterword, Longenecker and Simonetti suggest how to \\"get the ball rolling\\" toward getting results: Always start with the end in mind, build a model of the absolutes to your organization to be effective as a leader, identify the practices that are most critical to your success, and develop the talents needed to implement and sustain the absolutes for high-performance. Heard all this before? Probably. Are you satisfied with the results you and your organization are now achieving? If not, here is a source to help clarify and assist your initiatives in weeks and months to come.

Ehrenreich voluntarily  placed herself in a highly vulnerable position (one shared with perhaps several million others) and explains what happened next. She knew that her situation would not be permanent. She carefully observed those around her. She asked lots of questions. Most important, she absorbed and digested her and others' experiences which later served as the core material of this book. For me, there are several lessons to be learned and the most valuable of those lessons suggests that getting as much formal education as possible is no guarantee of success in life but it is frequently a decisive factor. I wish this book had been available when my three sons and daughter entered high school. I plan to give a copy of it to each of the grandcildren as a 14th birthday gift. How easy it is for most of us to take what Leona Helmsley once called &quot;the little people&quot; for granted. They serve fast food meals at the counter, they fetch dry cleaning, they dry off cars which emerge from the car wash conveyor, etc. Generally, they are unskilled to do much else.  This book helps its reader to gain a much better understanding of  those who struggle (with mixed results) to &quot;get by&quot; in our society. To Ehrenreich's credit, she never glorifies nor demeans any of those with whom she was associated. She admires their courage and respects their dignity. At least by implication she suggests that her reader do so also.	2002-01-03

Gilman and Berg achieve two primary objectives: They help their reader to determine, first, what the most important \\"point\\" is; then, they help the reader to \\"get\\" to it ASAP with clarity and precision. The same principles of the program are relevant to every situation in which there is a need to communicate but it is important to note that this is not a \\"how to\\" book for those who need help preparing and then presenting formal speeches. \\"Rather, we are referring to the relatively short and informal talks with clearly defined objectives that take place most often in a work-related context.\\" The authors prefer the word \\"presentations\\" to \\"speeches\\" as in a one-on-one situation in which someone must persuade her or his supervisor to make a certain approval decision or take a specific action. I think this book is very well organized. The authors have dozens of key points which they get to in exemplary fashion. Their approach is practical rather than theoretical, based on many years of real-world experience with training all manner of persons who needed to understand how to say what they meant inorder to get what they wanted. Although most of the examples in the book are in a business context, the lessons to be learned are also relevant to presentations elsewhere, such as a committee report to members of a church, a briefing to members of a social organization, or participation in a \\"Career Day\\" program at a school. The authors also explain \\"How to Introduce a Speaker\\" (Chapter 24). In earlier chapters, they offer some excellent advice on other subjects such as \\"Clothing: What the Well-Dressed Presenter Wears\\", \\"Picture Perfect Videoconferencing\\", and \\"The Job Interview.\\" For many people, this may well be the most valuable book they read during the next 12 months.	2002-01-02

Arguably the creator of what we now refer to as \\"modern dance,\\" Isadora Duncan certainly filled her \\"sensational\\" personal life with a series of adventures and misadventures while struggling to sustain a career during which so many of her knowledgeable contemporaries praised her artistic talents and achievements. Consider these comments:<br />\\"I got an impression of enormous grace, and enormous power in her dancing -- she was very serious, and held the audience and held them completely.\\" (Frederick Ashton)<br />\\"She moved with those wonderful steps of hers with simplicity and detachment that could only come through the intuition of genius itself.\\" (Tamara Karsavina)<br />\\"She incarnated music in her dance.\\" (Serge Kousevitsky)<br />\\"The soul becomes drunk with this endless succession of beautiful lines and groupings [of movement].\\" (Ernest Newman)<br />\\"The greatest woman I have ever known....Sometimes I think she is the greatest woman the world has ever known.\\" (Rodin)<br />Impressive accolades indeed which, for me, increase the poignancy (at times the tragedy) of her poor judgment and irresponsible behavior when not performing before an always adoring audience. Even for those who know little (if anything) about dance, Kurth has written an absorbing, at times compelling biography of a woman who (in the words of a contemporary, Janet Flanner) embodied \\"the grandeur of permanent ideals...[but was] too expansive for personal salvation.\\"<br />By the time I approached the final chapter of Kurth's biography, I had observed a number of similarities between Isadora's life and the lives of Edna St. Vincent Millay and Sylvia Plath. For example, their original and substantial talent, their excessive self-indulgences, their passion for experiencing (both physically and emotionally) as much as possible each day, and their vulnerabilities which so many others exploited shamelessly. With Whitman in mind, Robert Gottlieb observes: \\"For Isadora there were no rules, there was only the Song of Herself; she lacked the discipline, the emotional and moral resources, to keep liberty from lapsing into license.\\" Such is often the fate of a genius which, by most accounts, Isadora Duncan was. \\"Sensational\\" indeed.shamelessly.

Less obvious is the profound importance of understanding (a) why there are \\"lines\\", (b) how they got there, and (c) who decided where to place them. Of even greater importance is understanding how to take initiatives in those areas in which creative thinking is not only appropriate but essential. New product development, for example, or positioning which differentiates an organization from its competition. (Other areas obviously require \\"coloring\\" only inside the \\"lines.\\" There are some highly creative accountants who now receive their mail at a federal penitentiary.) I am all in favor of \\"thinking outside the box\\" even as I remain convinced that, at least most of the time, answers to questions or solutions to problems can only be effective when implemented inside a \\"box\\" of some kind. Only breakthrough thinking (e.g. mass production of automobiles, development of the Internet) creates entirely new \\"boxes\\" which then replace the old ones. Subsequent innovations then reconfigure the \\"lines\\" until other new \\"boxes\\" become dominant. Of course, Jeff Tobe understands all this as he shares his thoughts on creativity, marketing, and sales. He has a great deal of value to share.<br />His is a much more personal book than those written on the same general subject by others such as Claxton, de Bono, Levesque, Michalko, and von Oech. It covers less material. That's OK.

According to Drucker, this volume has two purposes: \\"First, it offers, I hope, a coherent and fairly comprehensive Introduction to Management. But second, it gives an Overview of my works on management and thus answers a question that my editors and I have asked again and again. Where do I start to read Drucker? Which of his writings are essential?\\" The material is divided within three parts: Management, The Individual, and Society. In all of what Drucker has published thus far, he either asserts or implies that the profession of management has obligations to society in general (indeed to the global human community) as well as to any one organization. Indeed, he entitles another of his works The Profession of Management. The title of Drucker's first chapter in this volume suggests this: \\"Management as Social Function and Liberal Art.\\" The title of the final chapter is \\"From Analysis to Perception -- The New Worldview.\\" As always, Drucker has one eye on the task at hand and the other on the future. All of the material in this volume is first-rate. It remains for each reader to determine which material is of greatest relevance to her or his specific needs and interests. Other reviewers may wish to quibble with Drucker about some of his selections. Be my guest.	2001-12-31

Normally I do not read any other reviews of a book until after I have composed my own but I made an exception with this one and was surprised, frankly, to encounter such a wide range of opinions among the almost 300 people who have written Customer Reviews for Amazon.com thus far. My own opinion is that this is an especially important book for several reasons but first, an opinion about its author. Schlosser is not the \\"sensationalist\\" and \\"muckraker\\" many have suggested; rather, I think, he is a cultural anthropologist who explores the correlations between the fast food industry and the larger human community in which speed is among the most highly praised (and most highly rewarded) of attributes. The American people also appreciate convenience. Hence the popularity of drive-through shopping and banking, cellular phones, home delivery of goods and services (including gourmet meals), online shopping and bill paying, and even locating some candidates online for social companionship, if not marriage. The American people also seem to grow more impatient each day. Hence the popularity of the channel changer, DSL connections, HOV lanes, \\"quick lubes\\", and various forms of what in Dallas are called \\"toll tags\\" which can also be used to pay for parking throughout the city, including airports.<br />I mention all this by way of explaining my first reason for thinking so highly of this book: functioning as a cultural anthropologist, Schlosser makes a substantial contribution to our understanding of a society which cherishes (to the extreme) both convenience and speed. My second reason is that Schlosser, in process, also provides an eloquent and convincing indictment of the nutritional deficiencies of fast food. I already knew that fast food, especially when consumed to excess, was undesirable. I had no idea, however, that it could also be unhealthy. (At this point, I feel obliged to admit to an addiction to the #4 Value Meal at McDonald's. Also, as a grandparent, I appreciate the ease and relatively low cost of making a quick stop to feed hungry grandchildren almost anywhere we may be.) My third and final reason is that, in this book, Schlosser also raises important questions and addresses important issues concerning the values of our society. With Americans eating (on average) three of every five meals prepared outside the home, what does that suggest?  The television set is often used as a baby-sitter. When used in combination with a fast food meal, what does that suggest about the quality of a child's family life? In my opinion, Schlosser requires his reader to consider why the fast food industry now plays such a central role in our society.  For some of us, at least, his accusations hit the mark and his conclusions are rock-solid. Increased speed and convenience in all human activities usually have a price to be paid. Insofar as fast food is concerned, Schlosser helps all of us to determine not only the price but the total cost.the ease and relatively low cost of making a quick stop to feed hungry grandchildren almost anywhere we may be.)

I was curious to know why Weintraub wrote a book about a brief period prior to Christmas in 1914, on the battlefields of Flanders, when German and British soldiers spontaneously agreed to declare a truce and suspend fighting, thereby defying their commanding officers. The answer to that question, in my opinion, has profound significance 87 years later. No doubt the book's impact on me is explained, at least in part, by the fact that I read it during the holiday season, following the events of September 11th, as a war on terrorism continues. But also because, as an eager student of military history, I am intrigued by isolated situations in which humanity (for lack of a better term) at least temporarily prevails over death and destruction. Centuries ago, knights and their attendants would work with their enemies to clear a field for combat the next day. Such cooperation had an obvious practical value. That's not what interests Weintraub as he examines a temporary truce during one of the bloodiest wars ever fought. It had little (if any) practical or tactical value but it did (and does) suggest a human need which transcends military obligations.<br /><br />Weintraub draws upon a wealth of primary sources (e.g. letters and diaries) in which firsthand accounts comment on the shared misery created by \\"shells, bombs, underground caves, corpses, liquor, mice, cats, artillery, filth, bullets, mortars, fire, and steel.\\" I am reminded of movies such as All's Quiet on the Western Front and Paths of Glory in which the human misery portrayed is almost unbearable to watch. I had the same reaction when seeing more recent movies such as Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down.<br /><br />As Weintraub explains in this book, at least some of the opposing forces decided to call what we today would describe as a \\"time out.\\" Several displayed signboards and banners which said \\"You no fight, we no fight\\" (by the Germans) and \\"Merry Christmas\\" (by the British). Messages and holiday greetings were exchanged, sometimes conveyed by trained dogs serving as intermediaries. Weintraub credits the Germans with taking the initiative but not all of the German soldiers and few of their officers condoned the truce. (The choice of the book's title is apt. More than 200 years ago, Joseph Mohr wrote the lyrics and  Franx X. Gruber the music of \\"Stille Nacht,\\" a German carol.) Nor did all of the Allied forces. Everyone involved correctly understood that battle would soon resume but at least for a very brief time, everyone involved (to varying degrees) experienced \\"peace on earth, good will toward man.\\" For many of them, death had merely been delayed. How welcome it must have been to have a silent night or two after enduring deafening bombardments. And no doubt an opportunity to reflect upon loved ones far away and to recall happier Christmases in the past.<br /><br />It is possible but highly unlikely that there will ever again be a land war of the nature and to the extent of the two World Wars. Never again will opposing warriors in near proximity exchange Christmas greetings and gifts. This is part of the significance of what Weintraub has recreated in his book: Warfare in the 21st century will mostly be waged by high-tech systems to deliver weapons of mass destruction to achieve global and regional military objectives. At least to this reader, Weintraub seems to ask: Why not eliminate war in any form so that the world can have a \\"silent night\\" every night? Why not indeed?d, sometimes conveyed by trained dogs serving as intermediaries.

Skidelsky offers a remarkable discussion of the man (as opposed to the icon) whose influence seems to have fluctuated according to conventional (received?) wisdom with regard to fundamental economic principles. Economists have either agreed or disagreed about the value of Keynes's ideas (often with more heat than light) since the publication of his major work, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936). As a non-economist, I have only casually observed how his principles have gone in and out of favor as the national economy itself  improves, flattens out, weakens, improves, etc. I enjoyed this book because it connected a human being with the principles to which so many others have referred in books and articles. Also because, as international trade accelerates in terms of both scope and depth (largely because of the Internet and the WWW), the role of government in each country will inevitably change...especially governments in those countries which were formerly members of the U.S.S.R. as well as in other countries in Asia, notably China. Thanks to Skidelsky's book, I am now much better prepared to recognize and understand such changes. I wish I had read the second volume in the trilogy (subtitled \\"The Economist as Savior\\") before reading this one. Those who read this review are urged to do so. However, judged wholly on its own merits, this final volume (subtitled \\"Fighting for Freedom\\") is a first-rate achievement.	2001-12-21

However, obviously, much more remains to be achieved in a society which still relies so heavily on gender-specific adjectives (e.g. female jockey) and hyphenated descriptives (e.g. Lilliputian-Americans). Let us all hope that Chenault and Parsons were selected wholly because they were best-qualified to provide the organizational leadership needed. Period.<br />The subtitle of Collins' book (&quot;The Making and Breaking of a Black Middle Class&quot;) implies -- to me, at least -- initiatives which were consciously and deliberately expedient. That is to say, in response to various pressures (especially from the federal government) on many corporations in the late-1960s to create access to career opportunities previously denied to black executives. These same corporations then &quot;racialized&quot; the positions many black executives occupied by limiting their responsibilities to supervising Affirmative Action programs, cultivating &quot;special markets&quot;, and solidifying relationships with minority customers. In almost every instance, this eliminated them from the &quot;fast track&quot; to positions at higher levels within their respective organizations. Their income permitted what Dick Gregory once referred to as an &quot;Oreo lifestyle&quot; but job security was tenuous. I was curious to know: Was the emergence of a Black Middle Class, throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, more a perception than a reality?<br />In an e-mail from her, she responds to that question. &quot;I really don't think the emergence of the middle class was illusionary at all. I think the socioeconomic gains were/are real but they are grounded in different sets of conditions than those that prop up whites. I think that its emergence and growth was, and still is, dependent on the continued support of public policies and social pressure. When I look at the Ken Chenaults and Richard Parsons of the world I see them as anomalies rather than as symbols of a a trend. In other words, I don't think these companies are going to integrate their power structures in a sustained way unless there's some type of external nonmarket pressure to do so. Of course, I could be wrong and, if so, I'll have to rethink my understanding of race relations in the business world.&quot;<br />I was also curious to know to what the extent (if any) the demographics of black executives (male and female) have changed since 1996 when her book was first published. In the same e-mail, Collins observes: &quot;The demographic trends associated with the number of black executives is almost impossible to measure for several reasons. One, the best source (EEO1 data that surveys private employers) groups managers so that rank is obscured. Managers counted here could be the manager of a 7-11 food store or a CFO of a Fortune 500 company. Census data does have an &quot;administrator&quot; category, but that probably relates more to public than to private sector employment. This problem has been my nemesis and probably will continue to be so because I am forced patch together information from various sources and than draw inferences.&quot; Although the scope and depth of Collins' survey sample may seem insufficient to support her generalizations (i.e. two sets of interviews with 76 of the most successful black executives in Chicago's major corporations), she consulted extensive supplementary research resources which apparently confirmed what she learned from those interviewed.<br />The Collins Web site features a statement which asserts that her analysis in this book &quot;challenges arguments that justify dismantling affirmative action. She argues that it is a myth to believe that black occupational attainments are evidence that race no longer matters in the middle-class employment arena. On the contrary, blacks' progress and well-being are tied to politics and employment practices that are sensitive to race.&quot; That brief excerpt refers to her analysis of circumstances almost two decades prior to 1996. It remains for each reader to read and evaluate Collins' book, then draw her or his own conclusions as to its relevance to circumstances today. I rate the book so highly because she addresses so many important issues which remain timely in 2001; also, because she raises questions which must continue to be asked, and then answered honestly, until such time that there is no longer a need to do so.evidence that race no longer matters in the middle-class employment arena.

In this brilliantly written and thoroughly entertaining book, Robert Emmet Long examines several of Broadway's most productive, creative, and dynamic choreographers and choreographer-directors of that culture: Agnes de Mille, Jerome Robbins (to whom Long devotes three chapters), Bob Fosse, Gower Champion, Michael Bennett, and Tommy Tune.  Long also includes an insightful Epilogue (\\"Broadway Today\\") followed by Notes and a first-rate Bibliography.<br />Friends of mine who claim to \\"love\\" Broadway musicals have seen few of them performed on stage. What my friends really mean is that they appreciate the music written for those musicals which they probably first heard when seeing adaptations and/or listening to sound tracks from films such as Carousel, The King and I, Oklahoma!, My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music, and South Pacific. I consider myself fortunate having been able to see, live, the original cast performances of several of the musicals which Long discusses in his book. They include The Bells Are Ringing, Bye Bye Birdie, Fiddler on the Roof, The Music Man, Pajama Game, and West Side Story. Film adaptations of musicals can only suggest the energy and excitement of the choreography  devised by those whom Long discusses in this book. What I especially appreciate is the fact that Long tells his reader so much about their personal lives as well as about their professional careers. Many of them collaborated on major musical productions. For example,  as choreographer-director of West Side Story, Robbins worked closely with Hal Prince and Robert Griffith (co-producers), Leonard Bernstein (composer), Authur Laurents (librettist), and Stephen Sondheim (lyricist). Throughout his career, Robbins was directly or indirectly involved with many of the musicals which were introduced during what Long characterizes as Broadway's \\"Golden Years.\\"<br />Today, given the development and production costs of new musicals as well as the negative impact of the economy on those who are prospective investors in them, there is legitimate concern about the fate of choreographer-directors. Does Long share that concern? \\"It is far too soon to write [their] obituary. With all these gleamings of fresh life in the theater recently, it is entirely possible that the choreographer-director will after all endure -- or more than endure, will go on to triumph again and again.\\"  Long carefully  explains how exceptionally  high creative standards were established on the Great White Way during the past 60 years by Agnes de Mille, Jerome Robbins, Bob Fosse, Gower Champion, Michael Bennett, and Tommy Tune, among others. My fervent hope is that, in years to come, others will accept the challenge and indeed triumph \\"again and again\\" as their Broadway ancestors once did.oduction costs of new musicals as well as the negative impact of the economy on those who are prospective investors in them, there is legitimate concern about the fate of choreographer-directors.

Each reader must make that determination for herself or himself. But I can suggest that Navarro provides a thoughtful and well-written perspective on investing within the context of global as well as domestic developments. The title suggests that when natural and/or human forces create a shortage of some kind, providers of whatever seems likely to be in short supply will benefit. Therefore, if the given providers are publicly-traded companies, a purchase of their stock may be desirable. However, obviously, rigorous due diligence on each of such companies must first be completed. There are certain situations in which what I call \\"blind hog\\" companies find an occasional \\"acorn\\" and their value is only temporarily increased. Because market conditions can change so quickly, short-term investments require constant scrutiny. Timing is of critical importance. (When asked how he was able to earn so much money from his Wall Street investments, Bernard Baruch is reported to have replied, \\"Because I always sold too soon.\\") The value of mid-term and long-term investments may fluctuate over an extended period of time as they are involved in what could be a sorting out process. Different criteria for measuring the value of their stock are needed. Any investor in publicly-traded stocks must have a \\"game plan\\" which is appropriate to his or her specific objectives, resources, etc.<br />I cannot rate this book Five Stars because, as indicated previously, I do not consider myself sufficiently qualified to comment on certain quite specific technical and legal as well as economic factors. (For that reason, in effect, the author is being penalized a Star.) I enjoyed reading this book. I found it thought-provoking. Ultimately, it remains for more knowledgeable reviewers to address issues beyond my expertise. Navarro got me thinking about a much larger context within which to formulate investment strategies. For that, I am grateful. One final point: Those who are unwilling and/or unable to commit the necessary time and energy to their stock investments should either not make them or entrust them to a VERY carefully selected advisor.in which to formulate investment strategies.

With tone of voice and body language as well as with whatever may be said, the correspondent reveals what could be called \\"attitude.\\" Viewers can even anticipate how Mike Wallace or Ed Bradley will react when, for example, interviewing unscrupulous physicians who victimize the elderly. The \\"story\\" is told from a specific perspective and often shaped by the correspondent's own values. Fair enough.<br />In this book, Goldberg discusses an entirely different form of journalism: national  media presentation of the news (both network and print) which, he insists, can be characterized by arrogance, elitism, distortion, hypocrisy and -- yes -- bias. Until last year, Goldberg was a correspondent at CBS who became a persona non grata (in 1995) after writing an Op Ed article published by the Wall Street Journal in which he accused his (then) employer of slanting the news with a partisan (i.e. liberal) subjectivity. Here is a brief excerpt from his book:<br />Those who control the national news media \\"love affirmative action, as long as their own kids get into Ivy League schools. They love handing out jobs based on racial preferences, as long as they get to keep theirs. It's a great deal: it's always somebody else who has to make the sacrifice -- sometimes Asian-American kids, sometimes other white students who don't get into places like Harvard and Yale and Princeton -- while the white liberal elites get to claim credit for being so decent, the saviors of black people in America.\\"  This is a representative sample of Goldberg's cynicism which sometimes becomes rage. Throughout the book, he offers hundreds of examples of political correctness taken to what seems like a lunatic extreme, of duplicity in the service of \\"image management,\\" and of what Dante had in mind when he reserved the worst ring in hell for those who, in a moral crisis, preserved their neutrality.<br />I was especially fascinated by his explanation of an industry-wide \\"code.\\" Goldberg asserts that the word \\"controversial\\", for example, is frequently employed by  major news media when describing anyone unsympathetic with their liberal principles. My own opinion is that when using the term \\"liberals\\" to characterize those who control network news programs, given the ferocious competition for viewers and advertising dollars, Goldberg really means \\"populists.\\" If Barry Goldwater's ideologies were embraced by a majority of viewers, I suspect, those principles would have a dominant influence on how the news would be presented. Whether or not a reader agrees with Goldberg's accusations, I think the reader would agree that he asks very important questions and addresses very important issues. This is a book well worth a careful reading and, I hope, will help to stimulate a rigorous re-consideration and re-evaluation of one of the most powerful influences in our society today.to what seems like a lunatic extreme, of duplicity in the service of \\"image management,\\" and of what Dante had in mind when he reserved the worst ring in hell for those who, in a moral crisis, preserved their neutrality.<br />I was especially fascinated by his explanation of an industry-wide \\"code.\\" Goldberg asserts that the word \\"controversial\\", for example, is frequently employed by  major news media when describing anyone unsympathetic with their liberal principles.

Events on and subsequent to September 11th have required all of us to view warfare from different perspectives. That process continues even as we await further developments. In this volume, McNeilly reminds us that there are certain fundamental principles of warfare which have remained valid throughout the centuries. Perhaps the first management consultant, Sun Tzu asserts in The Art of War that all battles are won or lost before they are fought. Moreover, he insists that it is better, far better to gain victory without having to engage in combat. Once combat is necessary, he suggests all manner of strategies and tactics by which to overcome an opponent. As you read this review, I suspect that certain warriors throughout the world (perhaps having never read nor heard of Sun Tzu) are utilizing many of these same strategies and tactics. Why? Because they are effective.<br />After a brief but highly informative Introduction (\\"The Relevance of Sun Tzu to Modern Warfare\\"), McNeilly examines the aforementioned \\"fundamental principles\\" within six chapters, citing numerous examples drawn from the history of modern warfare, and then provides his own \\"Conclusions\\" about \\"ancient principles for future battlefields.\\" He includes in this volume the superb translation of The Art of War by Samuel B.

By now Ford is widely recognized as an equal opportunity hater, not only of Jews, but as Baldwin suggests, he seems to have been obsessed with Jews. To a significant extent, Ford was a product of his times and of the specific circumstances of his youth and early career. He was not alone in his hatred of Jews nor was he alone when blaming them for all manner of social and economic crises whose true causes he was unwilling and/or unable to understand. Any evidence offered to dispute him was &quot;bunk.&quot; No one questions Ford's importance in the development of 20th century business. His achievements were abundant, unique, and of major significance. Of course, Baldwin is fully aware of those achievements which are undeniable.<br />The focus of his book, rather, is on Henry Ford the human being, not the industrial icon. Baldwin creates a context within which to understand Ford's personality as well as the values which motivated his behavior. We learn about the nature and extent of his draconian control over those whom he employed. We learn about the people he hired to maintain that control at whatever cost. We learn about his fundamental hypocrisies such as blaming the Jews for exploiting world wars to their advantage while he and his company reaped great profits from them, especially from World War One. Ford was an ignorant man and apparently proud of it. He learned only what he needed to know to establish and then build what has since become one of the world's largest manufacturing companies. Apparently Ford believed that he could mass-produce workers according to his strict specifications just as his company mass-produced automobiles according to equally stringent standards. Perhaps, just perhaps, Ford hated Jews so much because they did not meet such specifications. We know he used the word &quot;Jew&quot; interchangeably with other words such as &quot;war profiteers&quot; and &quot;moneylenders.&quot; He maintained strict control over the mechanisms by which he could propagate his anti-Semitism. For example, the series &quot;The International Jew: The World's Problems&quot; ran for 91 weeks in the Dearborn (MI) Independent which Ford owned.<br />For Ford, Jews were convenient scapegoats. After reading Baldwin's well-written and well-researched book, I still do not fully understand Ford's hatred of Jews. Perhaps even he couldn't explain it and no one else will ever know all of the reasons. In 1927, he signed (without reading it) an &quot;apology&quot; drafted by Lewis Marshall, a prominent Jewish lawyer. It is doubtful that the statement was sincere. More likely, Ford feared loss of business. His offensive theories about social engineering notwithstanding, he was until the day he died an unrepentant capitalist. He said or did whatever he deemed necessary to achieve his business objectives.Perhaps, just perhaps, Ford hated Jews so much because they did not meet such specifications.

Now the review.<br />This is one in a series of several dozen volumes which comprise the \\"Harvard Business Review Paperback Series.\\" Each offers direct, convenient, and inexpensive access to the best thinking on the given subject in articles originally published by the Harvard Business School Review. I strongly recommend all of the volumes in the series. The individual titles are listed at this Web site: [...] The authors of various articles are among the world's most highly regarding experts on the given subject. Each volume has been carefully edited. Supplementary commentaries are also provided in most of the volumes, as is an \\"About the Contributors\\" section which usually includes suggestions of other sources which some readers may wish to explore.<br />In this volume, we are provided with eight separate but related articles in which their authors examine these subjects: \\"The Organizational Frontier\\" (Wenger and Snyder), \\"The Smart-Talk Trap\\" (Pfeffer and Sutton), \\"Balancing Act: How to Capture Information Without Killing It\\" (Brown and Duguid), \\"What Your Strategy for Managing Knowledge?\\" (Hansen, Nohria, and Tierney), \\"Good Communicating That Blocks Learning\\" (Argyris), \\"Coevolving: At Last a Way to Make Synergies Work\\" (Eisenhardt and Galunic). \\"Organigraphs: Drawing How Companies Really Work\\" (Mintzberg and Van der Heyden), and \\"Stop Fighting Fires\\" (Bohn). Here are a few brief excerpts:<br />\\"As communities of practice generate knowledge, they renew themselves. They give both the golden eggs and the goose that lays them.\\" (Wenger and Snyder)<br />\\"People will try to sound smart not only by being critical but also by using trendy, pretentious language.\\" (Pfeffer and Sutton)<br />\\"[Organizational defensive routines] consist of all the policies, practices, and actions that prevent human beings from having to experience embarrassment or threat and, at the same time, prevent them from examining the nature and causes of that embarrassment or threat.\\" (Argyris)<br />\\"The most effective decision makers are those at the business-unit level, where strategic perspective meets operating savvy.\\" (Eisenhardt and Galunic)<br />No brief commentary such as this can do full justice to the rigor and substance of the articles provided. It remains for each reader to examine the list to identify those subjects which are of greatest interest to her or him. My own opinion is that all of the articles are first-rate. For me, one of this volume's greatest benefits is derived from various charts and diagrams included such as \\"How Consulting Firms Manage Their Knowledge\\" (on page 68). Here Hansen, Nohria, and Tierney juxtapose Codification with Personalization in areas such as competitive strategy, economic model, knowledge management strategy, information technology, and human resources. Another valuable chart is found on page 168. Bohn lists a series of \\"Rules of Thumb\\" (rational rules which create irrational results) and suggests why each such \\"Rule\\" should be carefully re-considered. Great stuff.<br />Even those who already subscribe to the Harvard Business Review will greatly appreciate this series because each volume gathers together separate but related articles (previously published in the HBR) on the same general subject. The cost of each volume in the series is relatively modest; the value provided is substantial. Those who share my high regard for this one are urged to read various books written by Peter Senge as well as Working Knowledge (Thomas H. Davenport and Laurence Prusak), Dialogue and the Art of Thinking Together: A Pioneering Approach to Communicating in Business and in Life (William Isaacs), If Only We Knew What We Know: The Transfer of Internal Knowledge and Best Practice (Carla S. O'Dell et al), and finally, The Magic of Dialogue: Transforming Conflict into Cooperation (Daniel Yankelovich).ankelovich).	2001-12-11

Perhaps part of my atonement for this unintentional transgression has been to write The Agenda.\\" In his newest book, Hammer identifies and illuminates \\"a set of nine emerging business concepts that underlie how the best companies around are mastering today's turbulent environment.\\" He devotes a separate chapter to each of the nine \\"Agenda Items.\\" They are:<br />1. Make yourself easy to do business with you (ETDBW)<br />2. Add more value for your customers (deliver MVA)<br />3. Create a process enterprise (make high performance possible)<br />4. Tame the beast of chaos with the power of process (systematize creativity)<br />5. Base managing on measuring (make managing part of management, not accounting)<br />Hammer: \\"The purpose of measuring is not to know how the business is performing but to enable it to perform better....A good measure must be accurate, actually capturing the condition it is supposed to describe. It must be objective, not subject to debate and dispute. It must be comprehensible, easily communicated and understood. It must be inexpensive and convenient to compute. It must be timely -- that is, not requiring a long delay between the occurrence of the condition and the availability of the data.\\"<br />6. Loosen up your organizational structure (profit from the power of ambiguity)<br />7. Sell through, not to, your distribution channels (turn distribution chains into distribution communities)<br />8. Push past your boundaries in pursuit of efficiency (collaborate whenever and wherever you can)<br />9. Lose your identity in an extended enterprise (integrate virtually, not vertically)<br />At the end of each chapter, Hammer provides a brief but precise summary of recommended guidelines and action steps based on key points. Hammer proposes a full \\"agenda\\" of items and relevant issues which, obviously, decision-makers in each organization must modify to accommodate their own organization's specific needs, interests, issues, problems, resources, and opportunities.<br />How to plan and then implement a program once an agenda has been formulated? Hammer responds to this question in Chapter 11. He suggests several strategies for integrating efforts with sharp focus. He explains why it is so important to devote much more attention to \\"people issues.\\" He offers what he calls a \\"20/60/20\\" formula for managing different constituencies differently. He explains why committed executive leadership must constantly be evident. He also shares some ideas about effective communication. And finally, he emphasizes the importance of achieving verifiable improvement throughout each phase of the implementation process. I have learned from my own experience that it is highly desirable to pick the \\"low hanging fruit\\" as quickly as possible.<br />In the 12th and final chapter, Hammer shifts his attention to helping the reader to prepare for an uncertain future. In no particular order, he cites seven causes of severe \\"headaches\\" which many companies experienced in 1999: The Euro, the Asian economic crisis, major mergers and acquisitions, deregulation, ERP implementation, supply chain integration, and the Internet. He then offers three specific suggestions (create an early warning system, become proficient at responding to change, and create a supportive organizational structure), concluding his book with an especially relevant quotation from the Talmud: \\"You are not called upon to complete the work, nor are you free to evade it.\\"<br />It is important, indeed imperative to point out (on Hammer's behalf) that none of his \\"Agenda Items\\", observations, and suggestions should be considered a \\"silver bullet\\" because there is no one grand design, no one technique or single idea (e.g. reengineering) that -- all by itself -- can bring salvation and success. This is an important and especially timely book as organizations throughout the world (regardless of their size or nature) struggle to formulate an \\"agenda\\" which is appropriate to their current and imminent circumstances while being able to accommodate whatever may (and may not) happen later. Any such agenda is (literally) a work in progress. Michael Hammer is correct when asserting that no single source can fully assist that difficult process of planning and implementation. My own opinion is that this book should be included among any sources consulted. Indeed, Hammer's guidance is essential.self -- can bring salvation and success.

They organize their material within five Parts: Collaboration, Ingredients of Collaboration, Starting a Collaborative program, Tools for Collaboration, Making Collaboration Work, and Tomorrow's Business Culture -- Collaboration. They then provide ten appendices which range from \\"Printed Wiring Board (PWB) program\\" to \\"Examples of Mr. Allen's Networks with Major End Users.\\"<br />Here in a single source is about all that most decision-makers need to know when designing and then implementing a program by which to establish and then sustain collaboration with participation, as wide and deep as possible, by everyone directly and even indirectly associated with a given organization. Allen and Jarman also suggest metrics by which to evaluate the progress of such collaboration. Time and again, we are reminded that \\"you can't manage what you can't measure.\\" I agree. But first there must be a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective program, one which is appropriate to the specific needs and objectives of the organization for which it has been formulated.<br />With regard to the future of collaboration, Allen and Jarman explain that their objective has been to \\"expand the amount of collaborative opportunity to people at all levels worldwide, to give them an easy means to learn, to escape the shackles of their culture, their nationalism, prejudice, and interface with the world as members of the human race.\\" In that event, they will have \\"a positive appreciation for the culture and nation they belong to, yet foster better understanding as to how the world is integrated into one vast socioeconomic-political system.\\" Only then can they \\"better understand their role in the world and how they can play a constructive part in ensuring that the future is better for their families.\\" Whatever a given organization may manufacture, it also has the opportunity to create with all other organizations what the authors view as an infrastructure of spiritual values by which to nourish all of humanity.anding as to how the world is integrated into one vast socioeconomic-political system.\\" Only then can they \\"better understand their role in the world and how they can play a constructive part in ensuring that the future is better for their families.\\" Whatever a given organization may manufacture, it also has the opportunity to create with all other organizations what the authors view as an infrastructure of spiritual values by which to nourish all of humanity.	2001-12-11

According to Paul H. O'Neill in the Foreword, this book \\"captures the leading-edge theory and practice on how to leverage diversity for the benefit of individuals and the organizations in which they work.\\" It does indeed. Cox organizes his excellent material within seven chapters:<br />1. The Challenge of Managing Diversity<br />2. for Meeting the Challenge<br />3. leadership: The First Requirement of Change<br />4. Leverage Research, Develop Measurement Plans<br />5. Create Effective Education<br />6. Align Organizational Systems and Practices<br />7. Follow Up for Sustainable Results A Strategy<br />As you can see, Cox presents the material within a logical sequence inorder to achieve several specific objectives: to offer a systematic, comprehensive model for change as well as to provide data on the results of using that method; to include detailed examples to illustrate all of his main ideas; to include, also, an integrated case study on managing diversity efforts in one of the world's largest companies Alcoa, Inc.); meanwhile, to integrate relevant research with chapter endnotes; and finally, to raise questions in each chapter for discussion and further learning. He fully achieves all of these objectives.<br />Cox defines diversity as \\"the variation of social and cultural identities among people existing together in a defined employment or market setting.\\" Many of the largest organizations have operations located throughout the world. They are by nature \\"multicultural.\\" Other, probably smaller organizations are now involved in globalization initiatives and have become (or will soon become) \\"multicultural.\\" Still other organizations, perhaps even smaller, may not be (according to Cox's definition) \\"multicultural\\" but they do business with organizations which are; it is in their best interests to have a strategy (or combination of strategies) to capture, manage, and then sustain what Cox calls \\"the power of diversity.\\" I strongly urge decision-makers in all of these organizations to read Cox's book because all of the subjects, covered so well in logical sequence, can also serve as agenda items during the strategic planning process.<br />One of the book's greatest value-added benefits consists of various \\"Tables\\" and clusters of bullet points which Cox includes within a fast-paced but comprehensive narrative. For example, Table 3.1 (in Chapter 1) which provides seven examples of strong leadership behavior or Table 6.1 (in Chapter 6) which lists \\"primary climate factors\\" to be aligned with diversity.

Von Oech describes Heraclitus as \\"the world's first creative teacher.\\" He recalls being \\"infected\\" (happily) with the Heraclitean \\"bug\\" while studying in Germany 30 years ago. Now von Oech has written a book in which he brilliantly and entertainingly examines concepts such as symbol, paradox, and ambiguity in relation to creative thought. He offers 30 \\"Creative Insights\\" of Heraclitus which include, for example, these five:<br />#2. \\"Expect the unexpected or you won't find it.\\"<br />#4  \\"You can't step into the same river twice.\\"<br />#12 \\"Many fail to grasp what's right in the palm of their hand.\\"<br />#26 \\"Donkeys prefer garbage to gold.\\"<br />#29 \\"Your character is your destiny.\\"<br />Individually and even when clustered with the other 25, these \\"Creative Insights\\" may seem unworthy of careful consideration. In fact, von Oech provides a brief but insightful analysis of each which effectively demonstrates the wisdom of #12. Truly creative thinkers are always alert to what I call \\"the invisibility of the obvious.\\" They are not threatened by or even uncomfortable with symbol, paradox, and ambiguity. On the contrary, their minds are stimulated by them.<br />Throughout his book, von Oech inserts a number of brief puzzles for the reader to solve. (The correct answers are included and explained within the \\"Final Thoughts\\" section.) These puzzles are fun to grapple with, of course, and presumably most readers will solve them of them. My point is, the answers to the unsolved puzzles are no less obvious than the answers to the others, no matter which specific puzzles the reader is unable to solve.<br />Frankly, when I began to read this book, I really did not know what to expect. What of value could I possibly learn from a relatively obscure Greek philosopher? However, von Oech had already convinced me of the value of an occasional \\"whack on the side of the head\\" and \\"kick in the seat of the pants\\" so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. (See #12.) As always, von Oech is immensely entertaining. He has superb writing skills. And of course, he is an immensely creative thinker in his own right. I strongly recommend this little (in length) book to literally anyone who wants to put white caps on her or his gray matter. Those who share my high regard for this book are strongly urged to read all of von Oech's previous books as well as those written by Guy Claxton, Edward de Bono, Lynne Levesque, and Michael Michalko.did not know what to expect.

Vandeleur is a former cast member of both Disneyland and Disney World who now earns his living as a consultant to other companies to improve their customer relationships. Do not ignore the importance of the phrase \\"cast member\\" and the word \\"guest\\" because both are essential to understanding two of the primary reasons for the success of all of Disney's Magic Kingdoms: the role of each Disney employee, and, how each visitor is treated by all employees.  Indeed, both are essential to creating and then sustaining the \\"magic\\" of those communities. By design, the five executives are significantly different in terms of their previous business experiences, expectations upon arrival, personalities, initial reactions to Vandeleur, and (most importantly) the process of learning throughout interaction with him, each other, and various guests as well as cast members.<br />It would be a disservice both to Connellan and to the reader to reveal the seven \\"Lessons\\" which each of the five learns. However, I do want to note that Connellan (unlike Vandeleur) has never worked for Disney in any capacity. Also, that he assumes full responsibility for the book he has written, presumably written with the knowledge but not with the necessary approval of Disney. Also, that each of the \\"Gang of Five\\" is fictitious, as are all cast members identified by name except Michael Eisner, Dick Nunis, and Judson Green. Finally, that Connellan includes several of his own ideas about creating magic, such as Lesson 7: \\"Xvxryonx makxs a diffxrxncx.\\"<br />As indicated in his previous books and articles, Connellan has a great deal of value to say about how to provide consistently superior customer service. What I found especially beneficial in this book is Connellan's emphasis on the importance of collaboration throughout any organization to provide such service. I am reminded of a scene near the end of the film Spartacus when the victorious Roman general (played by Olivier) and his slavemaster (played by Ustinov) make their way among the defeated gladiators looking for their leader or someone who will identify his body.

I am reminded of a scene near the end of the film Spartacus when the victorious Roman general (played by Olivier) and his slavemaster (played by Ustinov) make their way among the defeated gladiators looking for their leader or someone who will identify his body.

Nimitz) as well as definitive studies of various great ships and epic battles. For those who wish to consult such sources, most of them are included in a substantial Bibliography and they are grouped appropriately. Lehman's purpose in this volume is to focus on the evolution of a stirring as well as colorful naval tradition which extends from the Revolutionary War through the end of the Cold War. When concluding his Introduction, he observes: \\"the greatest victories of the naval tradition have not been the wars recounted here but the wars that were never fought because American seapower was so strong that to challenge it would be foolhardy. If we let it, the strength of that tradition will continue to underwrite peace in our land.\\"<br />Obviously, even the strongest seapower could not have prevented events which occurred on September 11th but such seapower will always have an important role to play worldwide whenever human freedom must be defended or obtained. For me, a non-military historian, the greatest pleasure of this book was derived from  learning about people and events of which I was previously unaware. For example, Samuel Leech (a 14-year old \\"powder monkey\\" aboard the H.M.S. frigate Macedonian) and his compelling account of his ship's defeat in battle by the frigate United States under the command of Stephen Decatur, Jr. during the War of 1812. For many readers, perhaps, Lehman provides about as much information about U.S. naval history as they may ever need or want. Other readers will be motivated to learn more about specific \\"heroic men, great ships, and epic battles.\\"  I am within the second group. Lehman is to be congratulated on a unique achievement: He has brought significant portions of American military history to life and done so with passion as well as erudition.achievement: He has brought significant portions of American military history to life and done so with passion as well as erudition.	2001-12-06

Previously in The Six Sigma Revolution, he examined major corporations such as Motorola and GE in which Six Sigma programs really did create revolutions which continue as I compose this review. These are properly acclaimed successes. Of course, little (if any) attention has as yet been devoted to those organizations which initiated and then later abandoned Six Sigma programs. The reasons for doing so vary, of course, but most can be classified within two categories of resistance to change: cultural and technical. As O'Toole brilliantly explains in Leading Change, it is a formidable task to overcome what he characterizes as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" In this volume, Eckes suggests all manner of strategies and tactics by which to overcome resistance and then sustain Six Sigma programs, once launched. Correctly, he stresses the importance to an organization of achieving a \\"balance\\" between its culture and its technology. Moreover, at a time when change is (literally) the only constant and occurring at an ever-increasing velocity, its is also a formidable challenge to maintain the proper balance of the two. For many years, I believed that most people fear change. I no longer believe that. Rather, I have become convinced that most people fear the unfamiliar. Hence the importance of constant and effective communication between and among everyone involved. Eckes suggests that this book will show his reader how to \\"Create the need for Six Sigma\\" but, in fact, the need probably exists already so there is a need to help everyone recognize that need and appreciate the importance of responding to it. Therefore, Eckes also shows his reader how to \\"Shape a vision of Six Sigma so that employees understand the desired results and new behaviors of a Six Sigma organization.\\" Also, he shows the reader how to \\"Mobilize commitment to Six Sigma and overcome resistance\\" which is inevitable. Only then can any organization change its systems and structures \\"to support the new Six Sigma culture.\\" Next: \\"Measure Six Sigma cultural acceptance\\" and \\"Develop Six Sigma leadership.\\" All of these components are absolutely essential, difficult to integrate, and even more difficult to sustain in appropriate balance. In this volume, Eckes explains how and he does so with precision and eloquence.<br />In recent years, I have become more involved in Six Sigma or process improvement programs which vary somewhat in terms of their design and scope but all of which encountered several of the \\"pitfalls\\" which Eckes discusses in Chapter 8:<br />1. Feeling obligated to achieve quick success<br />2. Clogging up agendas with competing distractions<br />3. Having unrealistic time frames<br />4. Ignoring previous quality efforts<br />5. Conducting poor Six Sigma cultural planning and follow-through<br />6. Delegating (i.e. dumping) cultural development or seeing it as a one-time event<br />7. Not having appropriate cultural goals or objectives<br />8. Not allowing for unexpected interruptions<br />9. Allowing false or cosmetic positive readings to suggest authentic cultural transformation has been achieved<br />10. Underestimating resource allocation<br />Of course, whether or not involved with Six Sigma initiatives, any organization can experience some or even all of these \\"pitfalls.\\" In this book, Eckes offers sound, street-smart advice on how to avoid them. Time and again, he places great emphasis on the importance of cultural values by which everyone involved in a Six Sigma can be guided and, when under duress, sustained. Herb Kelleher has this in mind whenever he explains what Southwest Airlines competitive advantage is: &quot;Maintaining excellent customer service involves a process of getting people to understand the importance of it to them in their daily lives as well as in others'. We were a little concerned as we go bigger that maybe some of our early culture might be lost so we set up a culture committee whose only purpose is to keep the Southwest Airlines culture alive. Before people knew how to make fire, there  was a fire watcher. Cave dwellers may have found a tree hit by lightning and brought fire back to the cave. Somebody had to make sure it kept going because if it went out, there would be serious problems. That cave dweller was the most important person in the tribe. I said to our culture committee, `You are our fire watchers, who make sure the fire does not go out. I think you are the most important committee at Southwest Airlines.' I really do believe that to be the case.\\" This is precisely what Eckes means by \\"culture\\" in this book. For everyone in any organization already embarked on a Six Sigma program or now considering one, this is a \\"must read.\\"maybe some of our early culture might be lost so we set up a culture committee whose only purpose is to keep the Southwest Airlines culture alive.

However, he accomplishes much more than that in this book. True, he provides a series of what he calls \\"Killer Sales Questions\\", most (if not all) of which are now asked by the most successful salespersons. He also devotes substantial attention to the entire cultivation and solicitation process, suggesting all manner of dos and don'ts. Throughout the book, he correctly insists that the every effective \\"rainmaker\\" (i.e. one who brings revenue into an organization) has impeccable integrity, at all times and with all people manifests good manners, has a sincere commitment to the best interests of each customer or client, and seizes upon each rejection as a welcome opportunity to understand how she or he can be of assistance to (literally) anyone encountered, whenever and wherever that may be.<br />It may not have been Fox's intention but I think this is a book which should be read and then periodically re-read by anyone within any organization, not only by those which have contact with customers and clients. Think about it. If the objective is to create as much \\"rain\\" (i.e. revenue) as possible, why not involve everyone, including family members and friends, their family members and friends, etc. What about vendors? What about services providers (third-party centers of influence) such as attorneys, accountants, insurance agents, staff members of trade and professional associations, chambers of commerce, etc.? It is not sufficient to think of everyone within your organization as a \\"rainmaker.\\" You must also help them to understand what rainmaking is, how to do it effectively, and (most importantly) why. Each should be provided with a copy of this highly-readable book and urged to share it with their spouse.<br />Everyone within each organization should have an attractive business card which includes his or her name (of course) but also some indication of what the organization offers. For example: \\"Lots of people have problems selecting the most appropriate (whatever). We help them solve those problems.\\" Or a briefer version: \\"We solve problems with (whatever).\\" Have all employees carry their business cards with them wherever they go (e.g. dining out, shopping, athletic events, social gatherings) and encourage them to distribute the cards as widely and frequently as possible and appropriate. I highly recommend this book to those who are responsible for generating revenue as well as to those responsible for others who do. But I also recommend it for distribution among everyone else within the same organization (regardless of its size or nature) who can -- and should -- become involved in creating an on-going need for sturdy umbrellas.what the organization offers.

A Memoir	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Exceptional &quot;Reading&quot; Skills	Until reading this uncommonly personal and revealing memoir, I knew very little about Jordan the human being although I was already well-aware of his public career which includes leadership positions in the NAACP, the United Negro College Fund, and the Urban League as well as subsequent prominence in the private sector as (for lack of a better term) a &quot;powerbroker&quot; in Washington, D.C. while continuing to serve on the governing boards of several major corporations. Unfairly, I think, he is most widely recognized as the friend to whom then President Clinton turned for assistance when attempting to help Monica Lewinsky obtain a job after that scandal began to unfold. In this memoir, however, Jordan limits his attention to the years ending in 1981 when he resigned from the Urban League. Whatever differences there may be between him and Jack Welch (obviously there are several), both men credit their mothers with giving them the values, determination, and encouragement needed as they took on progressively greater challenges while encountering progressively more formidable obstacles. I was especially interested in Jordan's straightforward explanation of his differences with other black leaders, notably his determination to work within the economic system (capitalism) to achieve social and political objectives. He also disagreed with those black leaders who supported the Palestinian cause and thereby exacerbated black-Jewish relations. Jordan seems to be a consummate pragmatist, determined to produce desired results (e.g. a higher standard of living and a better quality of life for all have-nots, whatever their race) rather than merely indulge in self-serving rhetoric and public posturing (e.g. conducting press conferences in conjunction with crises to generate personal publicity). In this book, he shares dozens of anecdotes without at any time seeming self-serving. &quot;Vernon can read!&quot; but he also knows how to forge alliances, to open and then nourish channels of communication and cooperation, and -- in process --to celebrate his own humanity in ways and to an extent no resume could possibly indicate. If and when he deems it appropriate and is so inclined, I hope Jordan will shift his attention to the last 20 years and again discuss his experiences, not as a public figure but as a man with much of value to share.nnels of communication and cooperation, and -- in process --to celebrate his own humanity in ways and to an extent no resume could possibly indicate.

(He also summarizes more than 40 subsequent years which I hope he will discuss in much greater detail in a sequel to this volume.) Most of this book's focus is on his life in Budapest. Andras Grof somehow survived the Holocaust and then the Russian occupation before departing Hungary just as the Iron Curtain was descending. He lived in constant fear. Eventually, he and a young friend crossed the Austrian border (for me the most exciting portion of the book's narrative) and he finally arrived in America, becoming Andrew Grove. We know him today as the retired CEO of Intel. The book's title refers to a metaphor once invoked by a physics teacher who suggested that life is a lake across which students must attempt to swim. &quot;Not all of them will [succeed]. But one of them, I'm sure, will. That one is Grof.&quot; For more than four centuries, millions of others have also completed a perilous journey to the USA, with a majority arriving in New York harbor nourished by the same high hopes and great expectations that young Grof cherished. Few then achieved what he did. (Grove claims &quot;I am still swimming.&quot;) Tension and terror have even greater impact because of the matter-of-fact attitude which Grove sustains throughout his account. What I found especially remarkable is the almost total absence of any anger, bitterness, or recrimination as Grove recalls so many life-threatening situations, brutalities, and persecutions. In this instance, less is more. He lets the facts speak for themselves and they are eloquent.	2001-11-26

True, he has many insights into the executive search process itself, insights which may well be &quot;secrets&quot; previously unknown by most readers. His primary audience consists of career executives who are either now seeking another position or realize the need to plan a career which includes but is by no means limited to the position they now occupy. Melancon's insights can also be of incalculable value to students, their parents, and guidance counselors as well as to any others who wish to be better prepared to help students as they seek employment after graduation. (Over the years, Melancon has given a great deal of expert advice to the daughters and sons of family members as well as those of countless personal friends and business associates.) I also think this book will be of value to those in human resource departments who are involved, directly or indirectly, in the recruiting, screening, and (perhaps) interviewing of job applicants. Finally, I highly recommend this book to owners/CEOs of smaller companies who must identify and evaluate candidates but are unwilling and/or unable to retain executive search assistance from those such as Melancon.<br />There are 46 of the &quot;secrets&quot; to which the title refers. Each reader is already aware of several. Moreover, what were previously known before may have been forgotten so reaquaintance with perhaps prove helpful. For example: &quot;Include a keyword summary in your hard copy resume (#8), &quot;'Close the loop' with your references&quot; (#15), &quot;Always ask how you fit!&quot; (#26), &quot;Always ask for a copy of your test results and the interpretation&quot; (#31), &quot;When possible, ask for X weeks/months advance notice of termination&quot; as well as &quot;Negotiate extended temporary housing allowance&quot; (#39). Some of the &quot;secrets&quot; are obvious (obviously) but all, together, can help a variety of readers (not only those actively seeking jobs) to understand much better the entire process by which people can most effectively secure better, more appropriate positions.<br />This book can indeed be of substantial assistance to those &quot;on the either side of the desk&quot; who wish to (a) strengthen their own interviewing and talent evaluation skills and (b) improve substantially the process by which to select those candidates who are best-qualified to fill the given positions. One of the most useful features is the series of &quot;Checklists&quot; which Melancon provides throughout the book. Melancon's tone is informal, conversational actually, as he shares various &quot;professional strategies&quot; which will help anyone to manage both a personal job search and, in process, an entire career.

It is chock full of opinions, many of which you may disagree with. So what? Sarris examines a wide range of subjects (covering the 1927-1949 timeframe) which are organized within five chapters:<br />The Hollywood Studios [&quot;The Golden Age&quot; at MGM, Paramount, Warner Brothers, 20th-Century-Fox, RKO, Universal, and Columbia]<br />Genres [e.g. the musical, gangster film, the horror film, the screwball comedy, the western, the film noir, the war film]<br />Directors [e.g. Chaplin, Ford, Hitchcock, Hawks, Welles, Sturges, Wilder, Capra, and Stevens]<br /><br />Actors and Actresses [e.g. Garbo, Cagney, Bogart, Davis, Grant, Bergman, Harlow, Fields, the Marx Brothers, Tracy and Hepburn, and Gable and Lombard]<br />Guilty Pleasures [e.g. the &quot;B&quot; picture]<br /><br />Sarris then provides four appendices: Academy Award nominations and winners (1927-1949), New York Critics Circle Awards (1935-1949), Best Directors (1927-1949), and Best Performances (1929-1949). The various lists are interesting but the book's greatest appeal derives from the comprehensive coverage of 22 years of the American talking film's history in combination with Sarris' own opinions about most of those who created that history.<br />I highly recommend this book to film buffs, not as a definitive history of the period (there is none) nor as the single best source of film criticism (there is none); rather, as a collection of thoughtful, generally well-written essays which inform as well as entertain.<br />If you are a film buff and if, after reading this book you are motivated to see films you have not as yet seen or to see once again films you last saw years ago, Sarris will have achieved what seems to be his primary objective.	2001-11-20

Organizations and their leaders must not simply change to accommodate new realities; they must transform themselves effectively. According to O'Toole, \\"today's executives believe they are struggling with an unprecedented leadership challenge to create internal strategic unity within a chaotic external environment....Executives know what needs to be done and even how to do it. Nonetheless, they are unable to lead change effectively. Explaining the sources of this paradox and offering a practical way to resolve it are the purposes of this book.\\"<br /><br />Leading Change is divided into two parts within which O'Toole addresses three separate but related questions:<br /><br />1. What are the causes of resistance to change?<br /><br />2. How can leaders effectively and morally overcome that resistance?<br /><br />3. Why is the dominant philosophy of leadership, based on contingency theory,  neither an effective nor a moral guide for people who wish to lead change?<br /><br />For O'Toole, values-based leadership is provided by those he calls \\"Rushmoreans\\": They possess courage, authenticity, integrity, vision, passion, conviction, and persistence. To vary degrees, \\"Rushmoreans\\" listen to others, encourage dissenting opinion among their closest advisers, grant ample authority to their subordinates, and lead by example rather than by fiat, manipulation, or coercion. Granted, history produces very few Washingtons, Jeffersons, Lincolns, and Roosevelts. Nonetheless, according to O'Toole, there is much of value to learned from them by those who struggle with \\"an unprecedented leadership challenge to create internal strategic unity within a chaotic external environment....\\"<br /><br />In Part One, O'Toole explains why values-based leadership is more effective than any other, notably \\"tough\\" or \\"amoral\\" leadership which is frequently (and inaccurately) characterized as being \\"realistic.\\" For O'Toole, democratic leadership \\"is not about voting; it is about the democratic value of inclusion. There is nothing oxymoronic, chaotic, or ineffective about leadership based on that moral principle.\\"<br /><br />In Part Two, O'Toole shifts his attention to followers inorder to discover why we all resist change that would be in our self-interest to embrace, and, why followers so often resist the leadership they claim to crave. For O'Toole, Shakespeare had it right when explaining resistance to change: \\"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars/But in ourselves.\\" In Chapter 7, O'Toole briefly examines 33 of the most popular hypotheses concerning the root causes of resistance. They include the usual suspects: homeostasis (i.e. change is unnatural), stare decisis (i.e. status quo is preferable), inertia (i.e. difficulty of altering course), self-interest (i.e. What's in it for me?), and fear (i.e. of unknown). Of course, there are exceptions to each of the 33; also, all are never present in the same situation; moreover, no single one can fully account for all forms of resistance to change.<br /><br />Peter Drucker asks a very important question: \\"What is the environment ready for? One has to do it [i.e. seek change] at the right time.\\" Hence the importance of timing as well as of having all of the Rushmorean values. But together, they are still insufficient if (for whatever reasons) there are no followers. In Chapter 9, O'Toole discusses J. Edwards Deming inorder to illustrate this \\"curious and troubling\\" aspect of human behavior: \\"...reasonable men and women often resist acting on social knowledge which will advance their collective self-interest.\\" How ironic that Deming's managerial principles and methods which were so effective in helping the U.S. and its Allies to defeat the Japanese during World War II were then rejected by American industry but refined and and employed by the Japanese to dominate world markets. Then and only then were Deming and his managerial methods embraced by American industry in desperation to learn the \\"secrets of Japanese management.\\"<br /><br />In Chapter 10, O'Toole shifts his attention to Robert Owen (1771-1858) whose \\"paternalistic\\" treatment of his own employees earned an immense personal fortune for him. Meanwhile, however, he was widely reviled for mollycoddling the workforce (and thus not creating even greater profits) or for being a manipulative capitalist \\"in the government's pay.\\" Alas, as O'Toole notes, \\"Owen never learned how to overcome the deeply rooted resistance to change, a skill that is a prime characteristic of great moral leadership.\\" As a result, \\"humanity suffered for nearly a century from that singularly consequential flaw of one of history's gentlest souls.\\"<br /><br />In the final two chapters of Leading Change, O'Toole examines what he calls \\"the despotism of custom\\" and \\"the ideology of comfort.\\" Anyone in any organization (regardless of size or nature) who has attempted to be a change leader is already familiar with both. The question remains, how to overcome them? Everything which precedes these two final chapters creates a frame-of-reference within which O'Toole correlates and galvanizes his key points. Obviously, he fully understands why there is such great resistance to change. Also, he fully understands why visionaries such as Robert Owen fail to attract the support they need. He concludes this brilliant book with a rejection of leadership by command, manipulation, or paternalism...insisting once again that only value-based leadership can be both moral and effective. \\"Once a leader makes that commitment, all the other pieces will eventually fall into place, bit by bit.\\"methods embraced by American industry in desperation to learn the \\"secrets of Japanese management.\\"    In Chapter 10, O'Toole shifts his attention to Robert Owen (1771-1858) whose \\"paternalistic\\" treatment of his own employees earned an immense personal fortune for him.

Books	5	25	27	N	N	It's Not the Size of the Fish in the Fight....	Morgan explains how \\"challenger brands can compete against brand leaders.\\" What is a \\"challenger brand\\"? In his Preface, Morgan suggests that it is based on eight \\"credos\\":<br /><br />1. Break with the immediate past<br /><br />2. Build a lighthouse entity<br /><br />3. Assume thought leadership of the category<br /><br />4. Create symbols of reevaluation<br /><br />5. Sacrifice<br /><br />6. Overcommit<br /><br />7. Use advertising and publicity as a high-leverage asset<br /><br />8. Become ideas-centered rather than consumer-centered<br /><br />He discusses each in detail in Part II.<br /><br />Morgan's primary objective is to provide what he calls a \\"magnetic compass\\" for Small Fish which will enable them to compete successfully. Obviously, they face problems: certain markets have moved for the first time from maturity to overcapacity; as a result, there is not enough \\"food\\" to go around; and while turning their attention downward, the Big Fish have also turned outward...toward Small Fish; as the Big Fish moved downward, retailers moved upward. Time and again, he stresses the importance of ideas...actually, better ideas. Hence the imperative to break with the past: assume nothing, take no one and nothing for granted, constantly ask \\"What if?\\" and \\"Why not?\\" For Small Fish, the status quo is death. Period. Better ideas are engaging, provocative, and self-propagating. They help to create competitive advantages.<br /><br />Think in terms of an ambush: A Challenger brand can attack whenever and wherever least expected. A Challenger brand redefines terms such as \\"enemy\\", \\"opponent\\", \\"competition\\", etc. A Challenger brand has attitude. It thrives when underestimated. Better yet, when ignored. Big Fish know they are Big Fish. They have a tendency to become arrogant, complacent, hence vulnerable. By breaking with the immediate past, the Small Fish is able to answer several critically important questions such as What is the core issue re Big Fish?, What business are we in now?,<br />What business should we be in?, What are our best opportunities?, How can we implement a Challenger strategy to take full advantage of those opportunities?<br /><br />The four dimensions of a Lighthouse brand are identity, emotion, intensity, and salience. As Morgan explains, identity should be self-referential: \\"This is who we are and this is what we stand for.\\" Challenger brands should establish and then nourish an emotional rather than rational relationship with consumers. Sustainable customer loyalty, not temporary satisfaction, is the primary objective. Moreover, there should be intensity in all communications with consumers. Finally, Challenger brands must attract attention to themselves.<br /><br />In Chapter 9, Morgan observes that \\"Challenger brands are not somehow unusual in that they have a monopoly on good ideas; they are unusual, however, in that they make good ideas happen.\\" In Chapter 14, he explains that his premise so far in Eating the Big Fish is that \\"Challengers need their own models of strategy and behavior; that we [who must formulate that strategy] are entirely unlike the brand leader in position and resource and, consequently, need to find an entirely different set of rules of engagement.\\" In the next chapter, Morgan explains how to write the Challenger program, recommending a two-day off-site during which key people produce it.<br /><br />The final chapter pulls together all of Morgan's key points. They are effectively organized within a four-stage process: Attitude & Preparation, Challenger Strategy, Challenger Behavior, and Sustaining Challenger Momentum. Everything begins with and an attitude suggested by shin -- Japanese for \\"spirit.\\" Never give up. Never lose the will to win. Always be willing to take risks. (Jack Dempsey once suggested that \\"champions get up when they can't.\\") Morgan includes some copy from Apple's first 60-second television commercial after Steve Jobs returned. It begins: \\"Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The trouble makers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.\\" The ad copy concludes: \\"And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.\\" This book may have been written for Small Fish but can also be of great value to Big Fish. Moreover, at least a few Small Fish which use Morgan's ideas will become Big Fish. If they think and then compete as if they are still Small Fish, they will probably survive. Otherwise....The ad copy concludes: \\"And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.

As you probably know already, the word \\"kaizen\\" is a Japanese term meaning \\"to make better\\" with the implication that such effort should be continuous, indeed intensive and unrelenting. Since 1994, the Association for Manufacturing Excellence (AME) has developed a series of educational initiatives known as the \\"Kaizen Blitz.\\" In the Introduction to this volume, Jon Brodeur observes: \\"We think non-consultant-driven events -- training and on-the-floor work by the experts, the hands-on employees who have experienced the power of the Kaizen Blitz -- will continue to be a welcome addition to any organization's arsenal of improvement approaches. Small- and medium-sized companies can do it as well as larger ones and they may have an advantage if operations are small enough in scope to get their arms around.\\" However, positive and significant results can only be achieved with an appropriate combination of leadership at its highest level, acceptance (indeed enthusiasm) throughout all other levels, and tenacious involvement about attaining 20 percent to 50 percent improvement (or greater) in performance in a short time and in narrowly targeted areas. The effective Kaizen process must be top-down, initiated and sustained by teamwork, and focused entirely on doing \\"whatever needs to be done\\" ASAP. The authors of this book explain both how and why.<br /><br />The material is organized within 11 chapters whose titles correctly suggest the nature and extent of coverage: The Power of AME's Kaizen Blitz: Learning by Doing; The Roots of Kaizen; Improvement Strategy: Implementing the Big Picture; Getting Ready for Kaizen; Time Prints and Takt Times; How to Tell If There Is Improvement: Adding Value, Subtracting Waste: Uncovering the Flows: Establishing and Clarifying Process Flows; Forms, Charts, and Measurements; Sustaining the Gain: Lean Leadership; and finally, Never Look Back. Throughout the book, the authors reiterate the imperative that Kaizen Blitz initiatives must be sharply focused, task oriented, results driven, measurable and -- meanwhile -- FAST. Hence the relevance of the concept of \\"blitz,\\" which gained worldwide prominence prior to and then during World War II when Fascist and then Allied forces attacked enemy positions with unprecedented velocity. As the AME Kaizen Blitz has demonstrated so convincingly, the same strategy (with obvious modifications) can effectively be implemented within any organization, regardless of size or nature.<br /><br />Obviously I think highly of this book because it offers a sensitive, flexible, thoughtful and rigorous program to achieve what the subtitle correctly describes as \\"accelerating breakthroughs in productivity and performance.\\" If these brief comments suggest that this is a program your organization needs, I strongly recommend that all of its decision-makers read it. Then, schedule an offsite meeting during which the book becomes the agenda for collaborative efforts to formulate and implement a Kaizen Blitz appropriate to your organization's specific needs and interests. If there is a need for additional resources, I strongly suggest Breyfogle's two books as well as one written by Pande and his co-authors.sed, task oriented, results driven, measurable and -- meanwhile -- FAST.

Of new and better ideas, for example. Also, how to refine and then integrate the best of those ideas within and throughout an organization. Although it may not have been the primary purpose of the authors, this book has wide and deep application to almost any process in need of improved cycle time, first pass yield, and on-time delivery.<br />Moody has carefully selected and brilliantly organized a series of essays by a diversity of experts. Her objective is quite specific: to provide many approaches to the basic question of how to compete more successfully. Each section is preceded by an overview. The book is carefully organized so that each chapter stands alone. It remains for each reader to draw correlations -- between and among individual essays -- which are most relevant to the reader's specific needs and interests. When read in its entirety, the book's presentation of manufacturing strategy proceeds from theory and analysis of company and industry through formulation of appropriate competitive strategy to the tactics required to execute that strategy.&quot; The essays are organized within five parts: Historical Perspective, The Strategic Manufacturing Planning Process, New Strategies, Management Focus, and Dynamics of Change.<br />Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book? Certainly, any decision-maker who is involved at any level of the manufacturing process but also, not to belabor the point, decision-makers in non-manufacturing organizations with the same objective: to compete more successfully by establishing and then sustaining constant and rigorous process] improvement. I wholly agree with Ciampa's caveats: &quot;Don't believe that yesterday's answers will work on today's questions....Don't believe that people who have done things one way for years will change their behavior easily if at all....Don't believe you can do it all yourself....Don't believe that you can anticipate everything or that you don't need any game plan at all....Don't believe the old adage,'If it ain't broke, don't fix it!' which flies in the face of every principle of preventive maintenance.&quot; He concludes, &quot;The wise leader is always looking for opportunities to make things better before they break. The cost of repairing a broken organization is enormous compared to the fine-tuning and constructive change required to keep it sharp.&quot; Moody and her associates are to be commended for providing, in a single volume, an abundance of valuable information in combination with wisdom of unique practicality.work on today's questions....Don't believe that people who have done things one way for years will change their behavior easily if at all....Don't believe you can do it all yourself....Don't believe that you can anticipate everything or that you don't need any game plan at all....Don't believe the old adage,'If it ain't broke, don't fix it!' which flies in the face of every principle of preventive maintenance.&quot; He concludes, &quot;The wise leader is always looking for opportunities to make things better before they break.

The material is based on the U.S.-based Next Generation Manufacturing Project (NGMP) and the International Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (IMS) program. Together, these initiatives provide a consistent, worldwide vision for global manufacturing. This book examines that vision with rigor and eloquence. The NGMP identifies the key drivers that shape the future competitive environment and the attributes of a successful competitor in that environment. It then characterizes the capabilities (&quot;imperatives&quot;) required to meet the drivers and to thrive. The &quot;imperatives&quot; are grouped into four operational strategies: 1. Building a strong workforce; 2. Developing and implementing advanced knowledge processes; 3. Using advanced manufacturing systems, processes, equipment, and technology; and 4. Integrating competitive strengths. NGM is explored here in three ways: through the eyes of the fictional CEO of a fictional large manufacturing company, as he prepares for a planning meeting with his management team; applying NGM as the CEO sorts through all the issues the management team must consider; and enabling readers to learn by doing - through exercises that simulate real-life business situations in which they are challenged to make decisions rooted in NGM principles. From these exercises, readers see firsthand positive results of applying NGM. Next Generation Manufacturing is must reading, not only for everyone involved in manufacturing from the supervisory level up, but for anyone else who works closely with manufacturing companies. Management consultants and other service providers, for instance, can be much more helpful when they understand what NGM is, how it works, and what it can accomplish with effective management and sufficient capital resources.	2001-10-26
1796140:US	51147790	R2XZEITY0N4AHN	1891984357	112399919	At Work With Thomas Edison	Books	5	18	20	N	N	Working to Achieve &quot;The Happiness of Man&quot;	Here is another terrific book from Blaine McCormick who, as he did so skillfully in Ben Franklin's 12 Rules of Management, focuses on an historic figure from whose life and work certain important \\"lessons\\" can be learned. Yes, they include lessons relevant to business but so many other kinds of lessons which anyone needs inorder to think more clearly and more creatively, to nourish and enrich one's personal life, and of equal (if not greater) importance, to persevere in the face of great adversity. Most people would agree that Edison was the greatest inventor who ever lived. Most people may not know that he was also a very shrewd businessman with a deep understanding of key issues such as allocation of resources (e.g. time management), setting proper priorities, delegating work to those better qualified to complete it, and creating and then sustain competitive advantage.<br />McCormick identifies and then examines ten different \\"Lessons\\" which, collectively,  delineate Edison's business model:<br /><br />1. Limit your way to greater creativity.<br />2. Talent comes and talent goes but mediocrity accumulates.<br />3. Creativity is all about making connections.<br />4. If you want to invent, build yourself an invention factory.<br />5. The greatest innovators have made a lot of F's.<br />An interesting point because most people fear failure. Edison passionately believed that the more failed experiments (whatever the situation) he completed, the more likely eventual success would be. Only through rigorous and extensive experimentation is it possible to determine what we don't know, and, what doesn't work. Moreover, what is true today and what works today may be inadequate or even wrong tomorrow. For Edison, failure (not success) was the best teacher. He was an avid student whose appetite for learning was insatiable.<br />6. In a capitalist society, whoever attracts the most capital wins.<br />7. The best-promoted technology will often beat the best technology.<br />8. The price of freedom is a premium most customers are willing to pay.<br />Another interesting point. An abundance of research data on \\"customer satisfaction\\" indicate that \\"convenience\\" (or \\"ease of doing business\\") is almost always ranked #1 or #2 among attributes. FYI, \\"Price\\" is ranked anywhere from #9 to #14.<br />9. Play is to innovation what rules are to bureaucracy.<br />10. Glow, but don't consume yourself.<br />McCormick organizes his material within ten chapters, including with several an  \\"Interview with an Innovator\\" section which poses questions or explores issues such as \\"Why Do So Many Men Never Amount to Anything?\\" and \\"How to Succeed as an Innovator.\\" Throughout the crisp narrative, the reader is provided with dozens of brief quotations from Edison's writings which correlated with relevant \\"Lessons\\" and  anchored in specific situations throughout his life. All of us are by now weary of (indeed hostile to) books which provide flimsy lessons from questionable sources, such as \\"People Skills Lessons from the World's Greatest Hermits.\\" Both in his book on Franklin and in this book on Edison, McCormick focuses on \\"Lessons\\" (albeit familiar) which are wholly authentic within the context he creates for them. Wisely, McCormick allows Edison the last word: \\"My philosophy of life is work -- bringing out the secrets of nature and applying them for the happiness of man. I know of no better service to render during the short time we are in this world.\\" There is no way I (or anyone else) can improve on that so I shall not try. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Edison in the Boardroom, co-authored by Julie L. Davis and Suzanne S. Harrison.The price of freedom is a premium most customers are willing to pay.<br />Another interesting point.

It is not a definitive history of the group, nor does it provide detailed biographical information about the group's most prominent members, nor is it a probling analysis of the broader and deeper context in which the group was established and then evolved. Yes, the reader is &quot;taken backstage at the world's greatest comedy theater&quot; but the experience (albeit enjoyable) very much resembles what a family member or friend would probably encounter when literally allowed backstage. After having read the book, I understood more about the group's development and the interaction (onstage) between and among the principals.<br />Perhaps you have seen the Olivier film based on Henry V in which, during the first 12-15 minutes, the viewer is transported back to the Elizabethan Age, to the London theatre world, and to the stage on which Shakespeare's play was performed. Brief scenes backstage are included. When reading this book, I had the same sense of being allowed limited access. Only when the two audio CDs are heard are the unique talents of the various performers brought to life. I view the book as being supplementary to the CDs. Together, they provide exceptional entertainment to those who enjoy comedic improvisation.	2001-10-25

Zarate has written an first-rate review of this excellent book but may unintentionally suggest that the value of the book will be greatest for &quot;mature&quot; organizations when, in fact, small-to-midsize organizations also have an urgent need to &quot;design and implement scorecards&quot; by which to obtain accurate measurements of various kinds. My own opinion is that their need is indeed greater because they have fewer resources available and narrower margins for error. Therefore, organizational waste and incompetence can have much greater impact. Aphorisms which endure express an essential truth. For example, &quot;You can't manage what you can't measure.&quot; There may be some exceptions but not many. What Brown accomplishes in this book is to provide and then explain a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system which accommodates most organizations' needs for operational metrics and plans, for strategic metrics and plans, and then for implementation of the &quot;scoreboard&quot; after it has been devised. He identifies ten &quot;Mistakes&quot; which create barriers to addressing these separate but related needs:<br />1. Tracking output/outcome metrics that cannot be influenced or controlled<br />2. Gathering data that tells you what you already know<br />3. Gathering data for its own sake<br />NOTE: Brown and I apparently disagree about &quot;data&quot; which I consider a plural.<br />4. Relying heavily [too heavily] on customer satisfaction surveys<br />5. Executives focusing on detailed metrics<br />6. Measures that are not linked to the strategic plan<br />NOTE: Kaplan and Norton have much of great value to said about this in their most recent book, The Strategy-Focused Organization: How Balanced Scorecard Companies Thrive in the New Business Environment<br />7. Failing to define Practical Correlations between [and among] key metrics<br />8. Reporting data that is difficult to read and analyze<br />9. &quot;Superstitious&quot; process metrics<br />10. Measures that drive the wrong performance<br />Brown explains how and why such &quot;Mistakes&quot; are made, how to correct them, and also how to avoid repeating them. For purposes of illustration, let's say your organization needs to improve performance in these three areas: Cycle Time, First Pass Yield, and On-Time Delivery. Although separate, they are also interdependent. Obviously there are problems which need to be solved. More often than not, a corrective action responds to symptoms rather than to root causes. We all know that many (most?) of those involved in any organizational process (regardless of nature and extent) fear change, resent what they perceive to be criticism of their performance, and will therefore resist (perhaps sabotage) efforts to transform the status quo. Hence the importance of formulating the correct metrics, applying them where they will generate the data needed, and -- meanwhile -- ensuring that the &quot;score&quot; kept is appropriate to whatever &quot;game&quot; is being played./>10.

The reader is also provided with three appendices: \\"Behind the Scenes with the retainer Executive Recruiter\\", \\"Outstanding Retainer Executive Recruiters\\", and . \\"Sources of Information for a Job Search.\\" The greatest value of the book is derived from Lucht\\"s advice, not from any sources to which he refers his reader, valuable though they certainly are. The key is to know which information is needed, why, and how to use it most effectively. I wish this book were available after I completed my formal education. I also regret that I was unaware of Lucht's insights and suggestions when making several major career decisions of my own. For those who are contacted by a recruiter or for others who fear that their career is lacking focus and direction, Lucht can be an invaluable advisor.<br />Many of us play golf, a game which has quite specific rules as well as generally accepted etiquette. Managing a career is really no different but many people do not know -- or least understand -- the rules and etiquette. Most professional golfers have a \\"swing doctor.\\" I view Lucht as serving essentially the same purpose for business executives. Professional golfers vary in terms of their size, strength, \\"tournament tested\\" competition, athleticism, judgment, self-control, and commitment. The same is true of business executives. Therefore, it remains for each reader to complete a rigorous self-audit. Identify strengths and weaknesses. Set bold but realistic career objectives. Then select an appropriate combination of ideas, strategies, and tactics from among the abundance of material which Lucht so generously shares. This is not a \\"job-hunting manual.\\" Rather, a comprehensive and cohesive guide to nourishing one's career by nourishing, in the process, one's self.knesses.

It is instructive to view the tragic events of September 11th from that perspective. Terrorists' motives as well as their strategic objectives and tactical means have differed (sometimes significantly) over the centuries. Hoffman does a brilliant job of reviewing and explaining a wide variety of separate acts of terrorism. All terrorists (religious or secular) are extremists. Frankly, I continue to have problems with the term \\"fundamentalists\\" because so many historical figures now revered acted upon the most fundamental of principles for which they were prepared to die...and many did. Like heroism, terrorism is in the eye of the beholder. Case in point: those involved with the Resistance in occupied France during World War Two. To his credit, Hoffman presents the material with great precision but without bias. It remains for each reader to formulate value judgments. Especially now, this is a \\"must read\\" for those of us who struggle to understand events on a recent Tuesday.	2001-10-25

As I read this book, I was reminded of Robert Fulghum's assertion that everything he needed to learn he learned in kindergarten. I was also reminded of Lynne Levesue's book, Breakthrough Creativity, in which she explains why it is so important to live -- not merely think -- creatively. The book's subtitle (&quot;Revolutionize Your Brand with the Genius of Childhood&quot;) indicates that he agrees with both Fulghum and Levesque: valuable life lessons can be learned (or reaffirmed) by direct association with children, and, such lessons can also have significant relevance to the business world.<br />Asacker creates a fictional situation in which a CEO named Bill West has become frustrated and depressed by the problems of his &quot;multi-million dollar&quot; company. He needs help and he needs it immediately. A friend refers him to a &quot;guru&quot; named Falcon. West spends most of the day with Falcon and his granddaughter, Annie. He then attempts to apply the &quot;wisdom&quot; he has learned from them. This is a modern fable, really, and brilliantly presented. Frankly, I was both skeptical and cynical as I began to read the book, as was West when he first met Falcon and Annie. The &quot;lessons&quot; West learns are lessons all of us already know and generally forget. For example, &quot;Keep an open mind.&quot; However, each lesson is revitalized by the human context within which it is illustrated.<br />Those who share my high regard for Who Moved My Cheese?, Leadership and Self-Deception, and The Power of Six Sigma are urged to read this book. As with each of the others, what you &quot;get out of&quot; Asacker's book will depend almost entirely on the nature and extent of your willingness to learn what you need to know...or to be reminded of what you first learned as a child and perhaps have since forgotten.	2001-10-10

He begins with \\"Dieppe\\" and concludes with \\"Home\\" while along the way sharing participants' accounts of their involvement in the invasion of North Africa as well as subsequent combat in Sicily, Anzio, Holland, and Germany. I was especially interested in the material concerning the Normandy Invasion and the Battle of the Bulge but found all other material also stirring (sometimes heart-rending) as well as thought-provoking.<br />Perhaps you have already read John Keegan's The Face of Battle in which he examines comparable combat experiences from the perspective of so-called \\"grunts\\"  who fought at Agincourt (1415), Waterloo (1815), and the Somme (1916). I was reminded of Keegan's book as I read O'Donnell's. In the latter work, we have eyewitness accounts of portions of various major European campaigns and conflicts in World War II. (It would also be of great interest to me to have, in a single volume,  equivalent accounts from those who fought in Pacific campaigns and conflicts. These are available, it's true, but from several dozen different sources.) As indicated, O'Donnell provides a brief introduction to each chapter. All of the introductions are first-rate. They provide a context within which to correlate various personal accounts, not only with the others but also with the overall development of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower once referred to as \\"The Crusade in Europe.\\"<br />I presume to share a personal reason for my high regard for what O'Donnell has accomplished in this book. Two of my relatives fought in World War II. Both were highly decorated. My father was an Army officer in the Philippines during the months prior to Japan's surrender in August of 1945.

He achieves three goals:<br />1. &quot;To give readers a guided tour of the language and strategies of all things Welch&quot;<br />2. &quot;To impart additional insights into Welch's key company initiatives&quot;<br />3. &quot;To chronicle the evolution of Welch's leadership thinking&quot;<br />Krames presumably had a difficult choice when selecting a format. He had several options, including alphabetical sequence (items listed A to Z) and chronological narrative (permitting career milestones and cause-and-effect decisions to illustrate business values and principles). Given the wealth of material at Krames's disposal, either format could have been effective but each poses certain challenges. For example, deciding where an especially complicated subject such as &quot;Six Sigma&quot; fits (&quot;C&quot; for Concept? &quot;P&quot; for Process? &quot;Q&quot; for Quality? or &quot;Six&quot; for obvious reasons). Ultimately, the format is merely a convenience for the reader to locate specific subjects.<br />For me, the book's greatest value is derived from Krames's masterful cross-correlation of specific subjects within their respective historical contexts. He carefully examines several of Welch's key initiatives: turning the GE hierarchy on its head (1989), launching the &quot;employee-driven quality&quot; campaign throughout GE (1995), introducing the product services movement (also 1995), and GE's &quot;e-Initiative&quot; (1999). Each of these and other initiatives had a background and each has since had profound impact, nor only on GE but on its multi-dimemsional global marketplace. Moreover, each of these and other decisions illustrates most (if not all) of what Krames refers to as &quot;recurring Welch themes&quot;: command-and-control is not the best way to run a company; involving everyone is the key to enhancing productivity; ideas and intellect rule over hierarchy and tradition; market-leading businesses can ensure long-term growth; finding leaders who live the values is more important than finding those who make the numbers; and finally, developing a learning culture is the key to creating a competitive enterprise.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are encouraged to check out Jack: Straight from the Gut (Welch), Get Better or Get Beaten! (Slater and Krames), Jack Welch and the GE Way (Slater), and Business the Jack Welch Way (Crainer).productivity; ideas and intellect rule over hierarchy and tradition; market-leading businesses can ensure long-term growth; finding leaders who live the values is more important than finding those who make the numbers; and finally, developing a learning culture is the key to creating a competitive enterprise.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are encouraged to check out Jack: Straight from the Gut (Welch), Get Better or Get Beaten!

As a result, it is easier to see from the end result whether each side maximized  (or minimized) its gain in the negotiation. In almost every case, one party -- or both parties -- failed to gain everything they could have gained from negotiation because they lost sight of the prize somewhere along the way.\\" The basic assumption of this book is that the terms and conditions of almost any transaction are negotiable. For example, obtaining a lower or higher purchase price of an item (e.g. consumer electronics, clothing, and real estate) or a service (e.g. a fee charged by an attorney, accountant, or -- yes -- management consultant). The same is true of negotiations involving a promotion, salary increase, labor contract, or a proposed budget. Also, renting a car or obtaining a hotel room.<br />Cleary's objective is to prepare his reader to gain everything possible from each and every negotiation through the effective use of one or more strategies, each of which Cleary explains. He reminds his reader that the parties involved in any negotiation are in it together. \\"They are your adversary only to the extent that they disagree with you on some details, on the shape of the deal. In the larger sense, the bigger picture, they're your counterpart, your partner. It will take both sides to get the deal. Don't lose sight of that along the way.\\" Nor of the aforementioned \\"prize\\": your ultimate objective(s).<br />Cleary organizes his material within six chapters: \\"The Dynamics of Negotiation\\" (i.e. power, leverage, ego, saving face, being right, and \\"drain the swamp\\"); \\"Preparing for the Negotiation&quot; (i.e. facts, principles, and priorities); [NOTE:  In The Art of War, Sun Tzu asserts that every battle is won or lost before it is fought.] \\"The Basics of Conflict Resolution\\" (i.e. set the tone, find the common ground, repeat back/empathize, and \\"Don't let your counterpart monopolize the spotlight or the microphone\\"); &quot;The Negotiation&quot; (Cleary stresses sixteen points such as \\"Be aware of the signals you project&quot; with body language and tone of voice but also \\"Be aware of what's going on away from the table\\"); \\"Rules&quot; (Cleary suggests 12 such as \\"Negotiations are 50% psychology and 50% sales\\"); and \\"Mediators: Lessons and Observations\\" (Cleary provides eight guidelines for mediators such as \\"Project neutrality in all you [say and] do\\" and \\"Create the atmosphere for an agreement\\"). Among all the excellent books on negotiation now available, this is one of the best. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of skills to maximize whatever can be gained from a negotiation (whatever its nature and circumstance may be) without losing sight of the \\"prize\\" somewhere along the way.\\"The Basics of Conflict Resolution\\" (i.e. set the tone, find the common ground, repeat back/empathize, and \\"Don't let your counterpart monopolize the spotlight or the microphone\\"); &quot;The Negotiation&quot; (Cleary stresses sixteen points such as \\"Be aware of the signals you project&quot; with body language and tone of voice but also \\"Be aware of what's going on away from the table\\"); \\"Rules&quot; (Cleary suggests 12 such as \\"Negotiations are 50% psychology and 50% sales\\"); and \\"Mediators: Lessons and Observations\\" (Cleary provides eight guidelines for mediators such as \\"Project neutrality in all you [say and] do\\" and \\"Create the atmosphere for an agreement\\").

Hence the importance of anticipation and (especially) preparation. As indicated in The Art of the Long View, Peter Schwartz is among those who advocate that anticipation and preparation are even more important now than ever before. Recent and tragic events offer neither the first nor the last evidence of that. But first there must be recognition of plausible possibilities and then an understanding of what the probable implications and consequences of what each possibility may be. Miller, Engelberg, and Broad explain how the CIA secretly built its own model of the Soviet-designed germ bomb and how the Pentagon attempted to create a superbug. They provide details about the former U.S.S.R.s efforts to produce biological weapons as well as an untraceable germ that instructs the body to destroy itself. They even suggest that, in the 1960s, U.S. officials worked on plans to attack Cuba with germ weapons. They examine the Pentagons ineffective efforts to defend against Iraqs biological weapons during the Gulf War (1991). That is why I admire this book so much. Please understand that I am unqualified to comment on the scientific information which the authors provide and discuss. But even non-scientists such as I can grasp the nature and extent of various dangers identified...and their potential consequences. In this context, consider situations such as these:<br /> British authorities discover that the separatist group Mau Mau, operating in what is now Kenya, used a toxic plant to poison 33 steers in an act of rebellion; no reported fatalities (1952)<br /> Palestinian workers claim to have poisoned a shipment of Jaffa oranges to Israel with liquid mercury; no reported fatalities (1978)<br /> At least 66 people die after anthrax spores are accidentally released at a Soviet military facility in Sverdlovsk, Russia (1979)<br /> A terrorist group calling itself Dark Harvest drops off a package of anthrax-contaminated soil at the Chemical Defense Establishment in Witshire, England; the type of anthrax used did not prove to be harmful (1981)<br /> About 700 people become ill in Oregon after a member of a religious cult allegedly used salmonella to poison restaurant salad bars (1984)<br /> Aum Shinrikyo, a Japanese doomsday cult, releases the poisonous gas sarin into the citys subway system, killing 12 commuters and sickening about 5,000; the group also experimented with anthrax spores (1995)<br />This information was provided in a feature article co-authored by staff members of the Wall Street Journal. Miller, Engelberg, and Broad (staff members of the New York Times) are well aware of all of these and other initiatives which indicate that the threat of biological warfare has existed for quite some time. They explain why secrecy is essential to the success of the bio-warriors who use such weapons as well as to the success of those who defend against them.<br />During the 56 years since Hiroshima and then Nagasaki, no other nuclear weapons have been used against an enemy (at least that I am aware of) but that possibility has always existed. Few nations can afford the cost of designing and constructing nuclear weapons. Few organizations can afford the cost of planning and then implementing the use of jetliners to obliterate buildings as well as killing those inside or near them. In sharp and shocking contrast, almost any individual can use bio-weapons for mass destruction in nature and extent once considered unthinkable.<br />This book seems to have been written for non-scientists such as I who are deeply concerned about all this. Presumably it was also written for public officials, especially policy-makers, who are responsible for protecting cities, states, and nations. Those who share my high regard for this book are encouraged to check out other sources such as Anthony Lanes Six Nightmares. If terrorism in any form is to be defeated, all citizens (not only public officials) must first recognize and then understand the unthinkable inorder to anticipate and then prepare for its multiple potentialities.heck out other sources such as Anthony Lanes Six Nightmares.

In fact it is not. What we seem to have is more of a briefing on rather than a definitive analysis of \\"the men and boys who flew the B-24s over Germany.\\" It is a great read, combining a lucid and lively writing style with exceptionally interesting information. I had no idea how dangerous the B-24 was to fly. (Ambrose characterizes it as \\"sternly unforgiving.\\") Nor how unpleasant it was to fly in it. (According to Ambrose, the temperature in its unheated cabin was frequently sub-zero). It was called the Liberator or \\"Lib\\" for short but also had several other nicknames which included \\"Flying Box Car\\", \\"New York Harbor Garbage Scows with Wings\\", \\"Spam Can in the Sky\\", and \\"The Old Agony Wagon.\\" I had forgotten that almost all of those who flew it as well as the B-17 (the &quot;Flying Fortress&quot;) were in their early twenties. I was reminded of that fact, portrayed so vividly in the film Memphis Belle and ignored in an otherwise flawless film, Twelve O'Clock High.<br />Ambrose devotes much of his attention to pilot Lt. George McGovern (age 22) and his crew as they struggle to stay alive long enough to fulfill their strategic obligations while completing the required 35 missions. (McGovern later served as a U.S. Senator and was the Democratic Party's candidate for President in 1972.) This is a brilliant narrative device, first because McGovern and those who flew with him in the Dakota Queen are obviously representative of thousands of B-24 bomber crews but also because the historical and technical information provided by Ambrose is anchored within a human context, one which is often poignant and at times tragic. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has read one or more of Ambrose's previous books; also to those who have a special interest in World War Two; and finally, to those who share my amazement and admiration when introduced to unexceptional people whose accomplishments are anything but.f Ambrose's previous books; also to those who have a special interest in World War Two; and finally, to those who share my amazement and admiration when introduced to unexceptional people whose accomplishments are anything but.	2001-09-21

He introduces each of the six within a fictional context but, make no mistake about it, any one of them could well become a reality at any moment. It would be unfair to the current administration to suggest that it is unaware or indifferent to the potential dangers which Lake identifies. (Presumably many of the senior-level members of that administration have either read or will soon read Lake's book.) The greatest value of his book, in my opinion, is that he helps readers such as I to think about -- and think more clearly and knowledgeably about -- the unthinkable. There really are no acceptable alternatives to doing so as we proceed into an uncertain and, indeed, a perilous future.	2001-09-17

In fact, it has been 26 years since Wurman formulated his concept of &quot;information architecture.&quot; The primary focus in this version, however, is the same: what amounts to the equivalent of ADD at a time when &quot;information overload&quot; continues to create problems with the recognition, differentiation, digestion, and application of data. (Davenport and Beck also have much of great value to say about this phenomenon in their new book, The Attention Economy.) As Wurman explains, he offers &quot;new maps for navigating through a stream of bytes that leaves us inundated with data but starved for tools &amp; patterns that give them meaning.&quot; He asserts that there has not been an &quot;information explosion&quot;; rather, an explosion of &quot;non-information&quot; or data that simply do not inform. What to do? Within 17 separate but interdependent chapters, Wurman suggests dozens of strategies and tactics which are guided by &quot;new maps&quot; and implemented with new &quot;tools&quot; inorder to organize data in new &quot;patterns.&quot; The result is an eloquent as well as insightful &quot;manifesto&quot; for the 21st century.<br />Here is a consolidation of Wurman's key points in the first chapter: &quot;We live in an age of alsos, adapting to alternatives. because we have greater access to information, many of us have become more involved in researching, and making our own decisions, rather than relying on experts. The opportunity is that there is so much information, the catastrophe is that 99% of it isn't meaningful or understandable. We need to rethink how we present information because the information appetites of people are much more refined. Success in our connected world requires that we isolate the specific information we need and get it to those we work with. If information is the product of the Digital Age, then the Internet is the transportation vehicle. That means more misinformation. The sheer volume of available information and the manner in which it is often delivered render much of it useless to us. The best teachers give us permission to get in touch with ourselves and become more of us. Everyone needs a personal measure to distinguish useful information from raw data. To entertain the radical idea that understanding might involve accepting chaos threatens the foundations of our existence.&quot; Wurman and his associates explore and develop other equally important ideas in each of the other 16 chapters. By indulging their interests throughout their own lives, &quot;and perhaps because rather than despite many failures&quot;, they have been able to design their lives. They invite their reader to become engaged, not merely involved, in the same perilous but ultimately fulfilling process. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Davenport and Beck's new book (identified earlier) as well as Borgmann's Holding On to Reality, Drexler's Engines of Invention, Hamel's Leading the Revolution, Locke et al's The Cluetrain Manifesto, and Nielsen's Designing Web Usability.

They continue to draw upon an abundance of real-world experience. This book may well be their most important thus far. In it, they suggest and then explain a number of strategies to create and then sustain solid relationships with B2B customers. Even if your organization is not currently involved in such relationships, these same strategies can also be of substantial value. Once again, the authors' essential idea (hardly original, they realize) is that businesses as well as most other human communities (e.g. a political constituency, a religious following, a military force) share at least this in common: Each is built one believer at a time to serve mutual self-interests. In this sense, the term &quot;B2B&quot; is a misnomer because people do business with other people. (Rest assured, I fully understand the differences between and among B2B, B2C, and B2B2C.) Even when purchases are completed electronically, they are initiated and fulfilled by people. Goods are manufactured by people. Services are provided by people. And so forth.<br />Over the years, when customers have been asked to cross-rank attributes of greatest importance to them, &quot;Feeling Appreciated&quot; and &quot;Convenience&quot; or &quot;Ease of Doing Business&quot; are either #1 or #2. (Remarkably, &quot;Price&quot; is usually ranked between 9th and 14th in order of importance.) It is also worth noting that, as Peppers and Rogers carefully explain in this book, as new efficiencies are created by breakthrough technologies, the quality of one-to-one human interaction becomes even more important. They include five case studies, including one which examines the policies and procedures of Dell Computer. Somehow, they gained access to information which is probably otherwise unavailable, except to those involved in the Dell organization. Each of the case studies reads as if it were a one-act play. However different their &quot;characters&quot; and &quot;plot&quot; may be, all five companies are literally customer-driven. Their ultimate objective is not to achieve &quot;customer satisfaction&quot;; rather, as Jeffrey Gitomer and others have insisted, their ultimate objective is sustainable &quot;customer loyalty&quot; (indeed &quot;customer passion&quot;). Peppers and Rogers provide a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system to achieve that objective. They would be the first to recommend that each reader make appropriate modifications of that system to accommodate the specific CRM needs, interests, and resources of her or his own organization.<br />Earlier, I suggested that this may well be the most important book Peppers and Rogers have written thus far. The system they provide in it is worthless, however, unless and until an organization involved in B2B is wholly committed (top to bottom) to doing everything possible to make each customer feel appreciated. One of the best strategies to accomplish that is to make doing business with it as convenient (as &quot;easy&quot;) as possible.<br />Here's another key point. Based on my own extensive experience working closely with all manner of organizations, I have become convinced that organizations cannot be &quot;customer-driven&quot; unless they are first &quot;employee/associate-driven.&quot; Those who feel mistreated cannot be expected to treat others well. Therefore, effective CRM depends almost entirely on the quality of relationships within a given organization...and each of them is also, inevitably, one-to-one.f Dell Computer.

Almost all of the thoughts, feelings, and experiences which Kreit shares are relevant to men as well as to women who must also struggle to overcome the trauma of a divorce, a separation, or the death of a spouse. My fear is that the title will deter men from purchasing this book and thus deprive them of the guidance and encouragement they need to overcome such a loss. I also take issue with the phrase &quot;tool kit&quot; which strikes me as insensitive to the severe pain which so many men as well as women suffer after divorce, separation, and widowhood. From her own personal experience shared with the reader, Kreit has learned how difficult it is to accept the reality of a new situation, to get values and attitudes in proper alignment, to move forward into an uncertain future, and eventually to gain (or regain) control of one's life. For me at least, &quot;tool kit&quot; is an inappropriate descriptive of what in fact Kreit provides.<br />After a brief review of the personal experiences from which she has learned various lessons of possible value to others, Kreit organizes her material within four Parts: Reality Check (&quot;Seeing where you are and where you want to go&quot;), Your Attitude (&quot;The tool to help you recover from pain&quot;), Your Actions (&quot;The tools to move you forward&quot;), and Gaining Financial Control (&quot;Ways to stay organized and in control&quot;), followed by a Conclusion section in which she reiterates key points. Kreit understands that readers (both male and female) who have experienced a traumatic separation from a spouse vary (sometimes profoundly) in terms of values, attitudes, and circumstances prior to, during, and then following such a loss. At which point in that process does the man or woman read this book? How receptive is he or she to what Kreit recommends? How effective is she or he when attempting to take appropriate action on any/all of the recommendations? For example, a woman who has lost a husband after a prolonged illness is in a quite different situation (and has a quite different mindset) than does a woman who finds a letter on the dining room table and is shocked to learn from it that her husband has left her and plans to file for divorce. In my opinion, the book will be of greatest value to those who pretend that Kreit is a close friend who wants to be helpful, either to them or to someone else they care deeply about. &quot;Here's what happened to me. This is what I have learned. Here are some options I think you should carefully consider.&quot;<br />Obviously, her book is an inadequate substitute for Kreit's direct personal involvement in a given situation but at least it addresses relevant issues and offers practical suggestions. One of the book's greatest values is derived from the &quot;Checklist&quot; which concludes each of the four Parts.<br />Presumably Kreit agrees with me that several of those who read this book may be in need (perhaps in urgent need) of highly-qualified professional counseling to help them cope with severe psychological problems. Over the years, I have known people who were plunged into deep depression following the accidental death of a spouse or who were unexpectedly abandoned by a spouse and required to raise several small children while overcoming immense debt they did not know existed. No single book or even aggregate of books, alone, could have helped them significantly. Family and friends rallied around them, as did clergy. Perhaps if they had read Kreit's book, they could have been more effective with their support.

Ultimately, it takes a great deal of personal courage for tanyone experiencing a painful loss to &quot;get up, dust themselves off, and start over.&quot; Read Kreit's book and then determine for yourself how helpful it can be to you and/or to someone else.	2001-08-29

Whether or not Jones is the greatest golfer ever is a judgment I eagerly entrust to those foolish enough to debate it. Suffice to say that he was among the greatest players and among the finest gentlemen ever associated with golf. Published in 1927 when Jones was just 25, three years before he won what has since been designated &quot;The Grand Slam&quot;, this is a book in which Jones (in collaboration with Keeler) invites his reader to accompany him &quot;down the fairway&quot; of a life as well as a game. The first eleven chapters review the competitive process until what he characterizes as his &quot;Biggest Year.&quot; In the final chapter of Part One, Jones observes that, &quot;I started the year 1926 with one glorious licking and closed it with another. And it was the biggest golf-year I'll ever have.&quot; Or so he then thought. In that year, we're told, &quot;Walter Hagen gave me the first drubbing, and of all the workmanlike washings-up I have experienced, this was far and away the most complete&quot; and later, &quot;George [von Elm] was too much for me....He simply outplayed me. It was coming to him....It was George's turn. So the biggest Year ended, as it began, with a beating. Still, I'll always feel kindly toward 1926.&quot;<br />In Part Two, Jones shares just about everything he has learned (to that point) about the mental as well as physical skills needed to play golf well. What struck me, throughout the book, is Jones's candor. For example, &quot;There are times when I feel I know less about what I am doing than anybody else in the world.&quot; He discusses putting (&quot;a game within a game&quot;), the pitch shot (&quot;a mystery&quot;), iron play (&quot;I like it&quot;), &quot;the heavy artillery&quot; (woods), miscellaneous shots (&quot;and trouble&quot;), and in the final chapter &quot;Tournament Golf.&quot; The reader is provided with a generous selection of photographs, many of which I (at least) had not seen previously. &quot;Early in this little book I made the statement that there were two kinds of golf -- golf, and tournament golf; and that they were not at all the same.&quot; When concluding this book, Jones acknowledges that he's been &quot;awfully lucky. Maybe I'll win another championship, some day. I love championship competition, after all -- win or lose.&quot; What will it feel like when he days of tournament competition have ended? &quot;It's going to be queer.&quot; Then he confides, as his &quot;little book&quot; ends: &quot;But there's always one thing to look forward to -- the round with Dad and [other kindred spirits]; the Sunday morning round at old East Lake, with nothing to worry about, when championships are done.&quot; Three years after sharing these thoughts and feelings, Jones won the Grand Slam and then retired from tournament competition. Some people have expressed their preferences for those with whom they would like to share a &quot;fantasy dinner.&quot; Were it possible, I would like to share a &quot;fantasy round of golf&quot; with Bob Jones, Walter Hagen, and Harvey Penick. Given the impossibility of that, I must seek their companionship in books such as this.Golf.&quot; The reader is provided with a generous selection of photographs, many of which I (at least) had not seen previously. &quot;Early in this little book I made the statement that there were two kinds of golf -- golf, and tournament golf; and that they were not at all the same.&quot; When concluding this book, Jones acknowledges that he's been &quot;awfully lucky.

I am reminded of the fact that a liquid almost always assumes the shape of its container. With any new resource, we must first grasp what it makes possible before we can take appropriate advantage of those possibilities. With regard to the Web, that process of recognizing its potential functionality continues for all of us. Here is an excellent introduction to \\"understanding the nature and meaning of the Internet\\" and especially, the Web. Follman duly acknowledges -- indeed frequently cites -- various sources, such as Berners-Lee's Weaving the Web, as she carefully guides her reader through three Parts: What the Internet Is (\\"the telephone company for computers\\"); Why the Internet is the Way It Is (\\"how computers and telephone companies shape the future of the Internet\\"); and finally, \\"the ways in which the Internet shapes communication and exchange and ultimately, us.\\" I highly recommend this book to non-technicians at all organizational levels who are directly or indirectly involved in e-business. I also recommend it to school and college students who are now preparing for a business career. Finally, I recommend it to owners/CEOs of small companies who are thinking about or already embarked upon e-business initiatives. To all a word of caution: Don't expect more of this book than Follman intended. This is an introduction, a primer really, for non-technicians. As she explains, her focus is on \\"What\\" and (I presume to suggest) \\"Why\\", not on \\"How.\\" After reading this book, you may wish to consult other sources. Follman includes a brief \\"Bibliography.\\" Here are three other books you should also consider: K. Eric Wexler's Engines of Creation, Nicholas Negroponte's Being Digital, and Jakob Nielsen's Designing Web Usability.	2001-08-24

It was an excellent idea then and an even better idea now as globalization initiatives of American companies increase and intensify. In the Preface, author Judy B. Rosener explains that her book is intended for executives and managers &quot;who want to improve their organization's bottom line, and for women who wonder why their career paths so often seem to be shaped by the fact that they are female.&quot; Note the reference to &quot;bottom line.&quot; For Rosener, it is prudent to leverage the talents of professional women&quot; inorder to create &quot;more innovative, productive, and profitable organizations.&quot; Also, for male executives, the principle of enlightened self-interest is relevant to their own success. It makes absolutely no sense to under-utilize the talents of women professionals, especially as the global economy continues to expand so rapidly and extensively. Rosabeth Kanter agrees: &quot;Whatever the duration and objectives of business alliances,...in the global economy, a well-developed ability to create and sustain fruitful collaborations gives companies a significant competitive leg up.&quot; Hence the importance of women.<br />As Connie Glaser and Barbara Steinberg Smalley suggest in Swim with the Dolphins, the female temperament is better suited than is the male's to concluding &quot;win-win&quot; negotiations, resolving conflicts, reaching consensus, preferring to cooperate and collaborate rather than compete, keeping an open mind, asking direct and relevant but not insulting questions, etc. Rosener describes the female temperament in terms of &quot;consensus building, power sharing, and comfort with ambiguity.&quot;<br />She examines five &quot;stages&quot; through which organizations must proceed if they are to undergo the transformation required by new realities as well as opportunities:<br />Stage One: Staying Out of Trouble<br />Stage Two: We Need to React<br />Stage Three: It's a Case of Survival<br />Stage Four: It's the Right Thing to Do<br />Stage Five: It's Part of Our Culture<br />Females as well as males within an organization will proceed from one stage to the next at varying speeds and within varying timeframes. Fair enough. However, all must reach Stage Five. Rosener recommends that, from both a strategic and financial point of view, structural reorganization &quot;should be undertaken in concert with efforts to rectify female underutilization. Flexibility and diversity are two keys to competitive advantage, and both are closely related to the underutilization issue.&quot;<br />So much in the business world has changed since 1995 when this book was first published. However, many American companies and most companies in other countries have yet to take full advantage of -- and reward appropriately -- the talents of women. The companies which do so have a significant competitive advantage, a &quot;secret weapon&quot; if you will. Professional women know at which companies they will be appreciated and rewarded, where there are the greatest opportunities for their personal as well as professional growth. It is no coincidence that these are the same companies which, year after year, are the most profitable in their respective industries. At least until now, many of our nation's companies seem unaware of or indifferent to this &quot;competitive secret.&quot;One: Staying Out of Trouble <br />Stage Two: We Need to React <br />Stage Three: It's a Case of Survival <br />Stage Four: It's the Right Thing to Do <br />Stage Five: It's Part of Our Culture <br />Females as well as males within an organization will proceed from one stage to the next at varying speeds and within varying timeframes.

It was situated between two World Wars, during the so-called \\"Golden Age of Sports\\" and \\"Golden Years of Hollywood\\", on the eve of the Wall Street \\"Crash\\" and subsequent \\"Great Depression.\\" Arguably no other single year (before or since) embraced the scope and depth of human diversity that 1927 did. So many authentic celebrities: Capone, Chaplin, Coolidge, Darrow, Dempsey, Ederle, Edison, Ellington, Fitzgerald, Ford, Gershwin, Grange, Jolson, Jones, Mencken, Rockne, Ruth, Sacco and Vanzetti, Tilden, and Tunney.  In 1927, Leinwand asserts that \\"Americans were bombarded with the staccato of rapidly developing events at home and abroad from the ever-bolder tabloids and from the newscasts of the still-infant radio....If 1927 was the `high tide' of the twenties, then during that year could be found signs that the `good times' were nearing an end. But who would dare call attention to the chilling evidence if doing so might unleash a self-fulfilling prophecy and perhaps an economic collapse? Ostrich-like, Americans kept their eyes glued to the movies, their ears to the radio, their hands on the steering wheel, and their heads in the sand.\\"<br />Leinwand carefully organizes his material within a chronological framework which extends from New York's celebration of the arrival of 1927 (in Chapter 1) to December 17th when an entire submarine crew perished (in Chapter 12). The easiest way to understand Leinwand's strategy is to imagine that, on the reader's behalf, he has poured over all of the editions in 1927 of the nation's major newspapers, collecting information which best reveals those people, forces, events, and themes which most accurately define that year. With circumspection as well as precision, he also suggests correlations between and among the people and circumstances selected. His book is, in that sense, a literary pageant with a rock-solid foundation of historical fact. Leinwand answers three questions of greatest interest to me: First, what was it like to live in the United States in 1927? Next, what sets this year apart from any other in that nation's history?  Finally, what were the nature and extent of 1927's impact (both positive and negative) on generations to come? For me at least, he successfully answers all three questions and does so with style and grace as well as with precision and conviction.Leinwand answers three questions of greatest interest to me: First, what was it like to live in the United States in 1927?

1870348:US	51147790	R3AAK3S6AOQZ6Y	0738204021	280529428	Whoosh : Business in the Fast Lane	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Creative and Intensive Collaboration in &quot;The Fast Lane&quot;	In the Introduction, McGehee suggests the need for new methods for leaders and managers in todays workplace. As I see it, organizations face two choices. The first option is to remain the same, emphasizing current methods of compliance, by which I mean consistently focusing on what the company has done, not on what it can do. That method calls for constantly measuring past performance, focusing on problem solving to regain what youve lost, rigidly holding onto past models of success, and creating experts in various specialties. McGehee thinks he has a much better idea and I wholeheartedly agree. Or, an organization can become a Creation Company. Creation Companies  see the changing nature of work as one of the greatest opportunities of our time, and they understand that the opportunity can only be seized by unleashing the individuals within the organization. What this means is allowing individuals the freedom to explore, discover, and take action on the organizations behalf, in real time. In his thought-provoking book, McGehee explains HOW.<br />He examines three trends (cultural, technological, and structural) which will eventually determine whether or not a given organization survives. He characterizes the first as the Death of the Corporate Myth: there are no jobs for life, no careers even, not in the traditional sense. The second is manifest in the rapid rise of portals for real time, instant information sharing, and Internet communities. As for the third trend, organizations (willingly or not) are being changed from stand-alone hierarchies to interconnected webs of alliances, partnerships, and outsourcing relationships. Unlike Compliance Companies, Creation Companies have leaders who emphasize freedom, not control;, an understanding that success means creating the new, not replicating the old; and finally, have a work style that values individual expression and collaborative work, rather than a work style that values group conformity and individual effort which ensures that conformity. Two other recently published books address many of the same issues: Hamels Leading the Revolution and The Cluetrain Manifesto co-authored by Locke, Levine, Searls, and Weinburger.<br />The whoosh to which the title refers what can happen in a Creation Company when, as one executive explained, We were all working hard. We were heading in the right direction and the next thing you know, things were just falling our way and we were running and gunning and boom, we were there. Thats what [italics] whoosh feels like. In other words,  those involved are in active, indeed intensive collaboration. Together, they enter what has been referred to in competitive athletics as the zone. The basketball touches only the bottom of the net. For a batter, each baseball thrown by the pitcher seems to be the size of a melon. For collaborators such as those described in Bennis Organizing Genius, there is a moment when they finally realize how to create the first nuclear weapon (The Manhattan Project) or the first feature-length animated film (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) or the first personal computer (Xerox PARC). All of the hard work, countless failures, and personal sacrifices have finally made this shared moment possible. There is a collective adrenaline rush.<br />Such a moment is obviously rare but virtually (no pun intended) impossible in Compliance Companies which, in terms of their culture and structure, are antithetical to a whoosh. McGehee correctly stresses the importance of rigorous and constant conversations about what an ortganization really values most. What are its non-negotiable values? Do these values nourish and enrich what are the dominant components of a Creation Company? Specifically, leaders who emphasize freedom, not control, an understanding that success means creating the new, not replicating the old; and finally, have a work style that values individual expression and collaborative work, rather than a work style that values group conformity and individual effort which ensures that conformity.<br />If you believe in the values of a Creation Company and are currently involved in a Compliance Company, you have two choices: either do everything possible to help it become a Creation Company or leave it and become involved with one which is. Keep in mind that anyone who is totally committed to those values is viewed as dangerous to those who dont. For me, one of this brilliant books most important points is that Creation Companies are (by nature) a serious threat to Compliance Companies. They have unleashed, nourished, and sustained a creative spirit which achieves for them a decisive competitive advantage. McGehee urges his reader to challenge and test the examples and models he provides. Use them to change yourself and your organization. Use them to develop creative possibility, and to unleash your own [italics] whoosh. If you accept the challenge, through this book, McGehee will accompany you each step of the way.

The material is carefully organized within ten sections which range from \\"The Real World: When Theory Meets Practice\\" to \\"Visiting Olympus: The Corporate Legends.\\" In the Foreword, Harold J. Leavitt suggests that there are at least three reasons why this volume can be helpful: \\"These verbal snapshots, taken together, provide a panoramic view of the actual organizational world circa 2000\\"; \\"In this era of volatility and impermanence, of mergers and takeovers and of wild markets, these readings remind us of a reality too easily forgotten: that much of organizational management has not changed\\"; and finally, the various essays \\"spotlight something far more than this year's managerial beats and beauties, and more than the unchanging, deep heart-beats of organizations. They catch the new, new thing: the speed, turbulence and instability that have sharply and permanently differentiated the new organizational surround from all its predecessors.\\" In effect, what we have here is a \\"yearbook\\" which correlates the past with the present while suggesting what an uncertain future could prove to be.<br />It remains for each reader to determine which of the sections and which of the individual essays (to which David Leonhardt has written crisp and insightful introductions) are of greatest interest and value. I hasten to add that, as a reader's needs and interests change, there will be what Adrian Slywotsky calls a \\"value migration.\\" Hence the importance of determining which essays are grouped within each section. (I wish the editors had listed them in the \\"Contents\\" section.) At the moment, the sections which interest me most are \\"Moving with the Times: Old Economy Meets New\\" (#3), \\"The Talent Squeeze: Recruiting and Retaining Employees\\" (#6), and \\"9-1-1: When Things Go Wrong\\" (#9). I also enjoyed \\"Visiting Olympus\\" (#10) which features brief but rigorous discussions of \\"corporate legends\\" such as Warren E. Buffett, David Merrick, Tom Landry, Bill Gates, and Peter F. Drucker, followed by a lengthier discussion of Sanford I. Weil. Julie Flaherty provides an appropriate Afterword in which she briefly compares and contrasts certain business principles (and cultural values) in the 19th and 20th centuries. Great stuff.<br />In the Foreword, Leavitt says this about the material in this volume: \\"No ribbons and bows here, no airbrushed warts and scars, just sharp, clear pictures of the new whirling managerial world, a world that will surely be whirling even faster by the time new M.B.A.s are ready to jump aboard a year or two from now.\\"  As we proceed into a new century, change may well be the only constant and yet....and yet, as various authors represented in this volume suggest, certain \\"hot ideas and best practices\\" have been essential to commerce throughout human history.

In this volume, first published in 1997,  Jasinowksi has selected and edited essays written by 26 leading economists and CEOs which, as he explains, \\"add up to a thorough investigation of American growth prospects. Although there are differences of opinion, the consensus is that dramatic economic changes have increased the nation's capacity for sustained, noninflationary economic growth.\\" Although the authors (obviously) approach various issues from different perspectives and offer different recommendations, Jasinowski notes that there is a significant consensus among them:  \\"First, they agree that in the long run, increases in output per person are driven mainly by technological advance....Second, the writers agree that market capitalism is the most efficient economic system....Third, there is a general consensus among the writers that the role of government should reduced.....Finally, there is a sense among these writers that the economic potential of the United States is greater than has sometimes been argued.\\"<br />The essays are organized within seven sections whose titles suggest their primary focus. I also identify an essay included in each section. 1. The Mandate for Higher Growth (\\"The Economic Growth Imperative\\", Jack Kemp); 2. America Can Grow Faster (\\"Damn the NAIRU and Full Steam Ahead!\\", Robert Eisner); 3. Growth Is Coming from Companies (\\"Small Business and Economic Growth,\\" Rosabeth Moss Kanter); 4. People Are Key (\\"the Power of Employees\\", Robert A. Lutz); 5. The Role of Technology (\\"Technology Investment Is Driving Growth\\", Frank R. Lichtenberg); 6. Global Competition (\\"Trade and Growth: Restoring the Virtuous Circle\\", Marina Whitman), and 7. Government Can Boost Growth (\\"The Growth Burden of Federal Regulation\\", William A. Niskanen). Jasinowski then provides an appropriate Epilogue, \\"The Rising Tide,\\" in which he reiterates several of the recurrent themes in the 25 essays. To varying degrees, their authors do indeed explore dimensions of the \\"rising tide\\" metaphor. Jasinowski expresses an understandable concern about the situation which the American economy continues to occupy, \\"growing and thriving, the envy of the world\\" and yet \\"restricted by a political and bureaucratic mind-set that does not realize how the global economy has changed [and continues to change] the economic rules.\\" That was true when Jasinowski formulated those thoughts several years ago and remains true now. Without an effective partnership of decision-makers in both the public and private sectors, free enterprise will fail to take full advantage the \\"rising tide\\" of global economics. No doubt many readers will challenge the assertions and conclusions offered within many of the essays but I think most readers will agree that the issues addressed remain relevant and indeed have even greater importance today than they did four years ago.n appropriate Epilogue, \\"The Rising Tide,\\" in which he reiterates several of the recurrent themes in the 25 essays.

Moreover, what occurred me as I began to read Froggatt's book is the dual nature of nakedness: being free of constriction but also being totally exposed, hence vulnerable and at risk. She identifies and then examines \\"eight essential principles for peak performance\\", all of which are eminently sound:<br />1. Take initiative to shed \\"the layers of complacency, fear of change, and resistance to new ways of working\\"<br />2. Trust yourself as you shed \\"the layers of management control, outdated performance measures, and mistrust\\"<br />3. Allow yourself a sense of joy as you shed \\"the layers of overwork, high stress, and sleep deprivation\\"<br />4. Celebrate your individuality as you shed \\"layers of conformity, one-size-fits-all routines, and fixed work hours\\"<br />5. You achieve and affirm equality for yourself (and others) by shedding \\"layers of hierarchy, status symbols, and dress codes\\"<br />6. Shed \\"the layers of one-way communication, misunderstandings, and idea-hoarding&quot;<br />7. Through wide and deep connectivity, you shed \\"layers of geographic boundaries, reliance on co-location, and misuse of technology\\"<br />8. You increase the number and nature of workplace options by shedding \\"layers of unproductive work environments, dreary home offices, and long commutes between them\\"<br />These principles are worthless unless and until you are sincerely, indeed tenaciously committed, not only to the values on which they are based but also to applying those principles with aggressive and sustained effort. I am reminded of what the Yoda told Luke Skywalker: \\"Do or do not. There is no try.\\"  Froggatt suggests all manner of strategies and tactics which can help her reader to take direct and effective action, guided by the eight principles.<br />There are several other excellent sources whose authors address many of the same issues. For example, Frederick Reichheld's The Loyalty Effect and its sequel, Loyalty Rules!; also Reina, Reina, and Chagnon's Trust and Betrayal in the Workplace. They wholly agree with the first principle which Froggatt advocates: You must trust and be loyal to yourself before you can expect others to; moreover, it is important to be a trusting and loyal person unless and until another person's behavior makes that impossible. Most decision-makers I know have poor delegation skills. What message does that send to those for whom they are responsible? More often than not, these decision-makers are personally insecure.<br />Where in and which circumstances a person works are far less important than whether or not that person trusts herself or himself, and, whether or not that person is loyal to his or her own values. For me, this is the most important point, one which Froggatt makes with precision and eloquence: Shed from your life whatever demeans and diminishes you. She urges her reader to become \\"naked\\" in terms of freedom within and beyond the workplace. Most limits are self-imposed. (Pogo once observed, \\"We have met the enemy and he is us.\\") Obviously, it takes great courage to shed all arbitrary restraints on one's freedom. It also takes great courage for supervisors to do everything possible and appropriate to remove all inappropriate limits on their associates.

Froggatt's book is an affirmation, indeed a celebration of what that combination makes possible for anyone's personal as well as professional fulfillment.xcellent sources whose authors address many of the same issues. For example, Frederick Reichheld's The Loyalty Effect and its sequel, Loyalty Rules!; also Reina, Reina, and Chagnon's Trust and Betrayal in the Workplace. They wholly agree with the first principle which Froggatt advocates: You must trust and be loyal to yourself before you can expect others to; moreover, it is important to be a trusting and loyal person unless and until another person's behavior makes that impossible. Most decision-makers I know have poor delegation skills. What message does that send to those for whom they are responsible? More often than not, these decision-makers are personally insecure.<br />Where in and which circumstances a person works are far less important than whether or not that person trusts herself or himself, and, whether or not that person is loyal to his or her own values. For me, this is the most important point, one which Froggatt makes with precision and eloquence: Shed from your life whatever demeans and diminishes you. She urges her reader to become \\"naked\\" in terms of freedom within and beyond the workplace. Most limits are self-imposed. (Pogo once observed, \\"We have met the enemy and he is us.\\") Obviously, it takes great courage to shed all arbitrary restraints on one's freedom. It also takes great courage for supervisors to do everything possible and appropriate to remove all inappropriate limits on their associates.

The authors also make skillful use of Edison's own recorded thoughts and feelings. Of special interest to me was what he had to say about the creative process. For example, \\"Men are just beginning to propose questions and find answers, and we may be sure that no matter what question we ask, so long as it is not against the laws of nature, a solution can be found.\\" This what the author refer to as \\"The Edison Mindset.\\" Edison apparently had almost no concern about a given experiment's \\"failure\\" which he continued to view, rather, as non-success to that stage. Too often, senior-level executives become preoccupied with results and neglect the process by which they can be achieved. Among Edison's greatest (and perhaps least appreciated) achievements was the establishment of the first research laboratory in which he and his associates would collaborate on various projects. Edison was a pioneer in recognizing the importance of assembling the best available talent and providing them with sufficient resources as well as a culture wherein those talents could be fully utilized. Davis and Harrison obviously have this point in mind when observing that &quot;benchmarking best practices without any regard for the underlying culture of the firm can be problematic.\\"<br />NOTE: For those interested in this subject, I highly recommend Organizing Genius in which Bennis and Biederman examine the collaborative efforts of those involved at the Disney studios which produced so many animation classics; at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) which developed the first personal computer; at Apple Computer which then took it to market; at the so-called \\"War Room\\" which helped to elect Bill Clinton President in 1992; those active in the so-called \\"Skunk Works\\" where so many of Lockheed's greatest designs were formulated; at Black Mountain College which \\"wasn't simply a place where creative collaboration took place. It was about creative collaboration\\"; and at Los Alamos (NM) and the University of Chicago where the Manhattan Project eventually produced a new weapon called \\"the Gadget.\\"<br />This is an extremely well-organized and well-written book in which Davis and Harrison use the life and career of Edison for guidance to understanding subjects of major importance today such as breakthrough innovation, collaborative effort, the development and management of intellectual property, and effective organizational transformation. They suggest that companies (indeed all organizations) function in one or more of five levels which comprise \\"the hierarchy of value\\" for intellectual property, a model created at Andersen's Intellectual Property Management Practice and then at ICMG:<br />1. Defensive: \\"If a corporation owns an intellectual asset (such as a great business concept), it can prevent competitors from using the asset.\\"<br />2. Cost Control: \\"Companies focus on how to reduce the costs of filing and maintaining their IP portfolios.\\"<br />3. Profit Center: \\"Having learned how to control many of their patent-related costs, companies at this level turn their attention to more proactive strategies that can generate millions of dollars of additional revenues while further continuing to trim costs.'<br />4. Integrated Level: In this level the IP function ceases to focus on self-centered activities and reaches outwardly beyond its own department to serve a greater purpose within the organization as a whole.\\"<br />5. Visionary Level: \\"Few companies have reached this level of looking outside the company and into the future. In this level, the IP function, having already become deeply ingrained in the company, takes on the challenge of identifying future trends in the industry andconsumer preferences.\\"<br />After an excellent Introduction, the authors devote a separate chapter to each of the five Levels and then provide a case study of the Dow Chemical Company, followed by three appendices: Mining a Portfolio for Value, Competitive Assessment, and Integrated Performance Reporting. They suggest all manner of similarities and differences between and among these five Levels, in process suggesting also a wealth of strategies and tactics to consider when attempting to achieve the desired results at any of these Levels.<br />To a greater extent now than at any prior time in human history, with all due respect to major developments such as the light bulb, telephone, automobile, and personal computer, corporations (indeed entire societies) seek \\"exciting, new, novel, and discontinuous innovations....For centuries, companies have linked ideas and money by embedding their new ideas (legally protected or not) into products to be sold or bartered. Today, however, an exciting new concept is revolutionizing the way companies extract value from their ideas: an idea no longer needs to be embedded into a product or service to create value. Today ideas are licensed, sold, or bartered in their raw state for great value.\\" And they are getting that value through intellectual property management (IPM). Hence the importance of encouraging and supporting \\"The Edison Mindset.\\"<br />Here in a single volume, the authors provide a comprehensive, cohesive, and cost-effective program. It remains for decision-makers in any organization now considering or at work on the design of an IPM to select whatever material in the book is most appropriate to their organization's specific needs. One value-added benefit of this book is that Davis and Harrison can assist with that selection process. A point made earlier, however, deserves repeating: &quot;benchmarking best practices without any regard for the underlying culture of the firm can be problematic.\\"d consumer preferences.\\"<br />After an excellent Introduction, the authors devote a separate chapter to each of the five Levels and then provide a case study of the Dow Chemical Company, followed by three appendices: Mining a Portfolio for Value, Competitive Assessment, and Integrated Performance Reporting.

Don't be deterred by the title (initially I was) because it is appropriate to the authors' purposes in their essentially serious analysis of why only some companies sustain market supremacy and profitability...and why the others don't. Years ago, Jack Welch (then CEO of GE, one of the six companies featured in this book) explained why he admires entrepreneurial companies:<br />&quot;For one, they communicate better. Without the din and prattle of bureaucracy, people listen as well as talk; and since there are fewer of them they generally know and understand each other. Second, small companies move faster. They know the penalties for hesitation in the marketplace. Third, in small companies, with fewer layers and less camouflage, the leaders show up very clearly on the screen. Their performance and its impact are clear to everyone. And, finally, smaller companies waste less. They spend less time in endless reviews and approvals and politics and paper drills. They have fewer people; therefore they can only do the important things. Their people are free to direct their energy and attention toward the marketplace rather than fighting bureaucracy.&quot;<br />These remarks are directly relevant to the key points which Catlette and Hadden make in this book. It is no coincidence that the most highly admired companies (i.e. those for whom employees of their competitor companies prefer to work) are also the most profitable as they dominant their respective marketplaces. They include FedEx, GE, Hewlett-Packard, Southwest Airlines, 3M, and Wal-Mart. Revealingly, each of these six was founded by entrepreneurs and each has since retained its entrepreneurial spirit. They are among the \\"Contented Cows\\" which have outgrown the \\"Common Cows\\" (e.g. Consolidated Freightways, General Motors, Texas Instruments, United Airlines, Xerox, and Sears) by a margin of roughly four to one. Catlette and Hadden explain why.<br />At one point in their book, they assert that \\"just as productive employees are not always satisfied, satisfied employees are not always productive.\\" A \\"Contented Cow\\" company offers generous employee benefits, including those which address personal needs. For example, EDS has a car repair facility, bank, store, day care center, and dry cleaners on-site. However, a \\"Contented Cow\\" company also has leaders (at all levels) who recognize the importance to their employees of meaningful work to do, high standards to which everyone is held accountable (a \\"level playing field\\"), a clear sense of purpose and direction, feeling appreciated,  and finally, meaningful opportunities for professional growth.<br />There is a \\"Summary\\" at the conclusion of each of the 14 chapters. These lists of key points will be invaluable to those who may wish to re-read the book (all or in part) as they attempt to formulate strategies and tactics to transform their own organization into a \\"Contented Cow.\\" I hasten to add that these key points are relevant to ALL organizations regardless of their size or nature. \\"To become Contented Cows. companies must realize that just as they have choices, their employees (particularly the better, more skilled ones) do so. The new rules of the game have been set, and now it's only a matter of time before everyone learns how to play, and play it to their advantage.\\" Quite true. Contented employees should never become complacent employees. I am among those who believe that great leaders inspire rather than motivate others: they activate in them what is, in fact, self-motivation. Davenport and Beck address this in The Attention Economy, correctly suggesting that there is a form of ADD in the business world which has serious, indeed profound implications for managers at the executive level.<br />Decision-makers in \\"Contented Cow\\" companies understand full well what will attract the attention of those for whom they are responsible. The challenge is to involve and then engage them productively and enthusiastically, indeed passionatelyin the given enterprise. Only if and when they are can the nature and extent of relationships with customers ensure sustainable profitability. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out David Maister's Practice What You Preach. His key point, with which Catlette and Hadden obviously agree, is that individuals as well as organizations must have impeccable integrity. \\"Contented Cow\\" companies are nothing more and nothing less than human communities within which such values are constantly affirmed, not merely in word but in deed.in the given enterprise.

What Corbin correctly suggests is that the most effective leaders are those who recognize, sooner than anyone else does, certain indicators of what often become emerging trends and perhaps even a new industry. Stated another way, they see the possible (perhaps probable) implications and consequences of events occurring now. I am reminded of countless such situations when someone (later characterized as a &quot;visionary&quot;) said something like this: &quot;If we can figure out how to pressurize the cabin, an airplane can transport people as well as cargo.&quot; Thus is how entirely new industries are developed. Corbin's book is about &quot;becoming a great leader under a new set of global rules....Organizations are recognizing the value in looking ahead. Scanning the horizon for various internal and external trends, global changes, economic booms and busts, and demographic peaks and valleys is part of the regular routine in many enterprises.&quot; At least ideally, these organizations develop leadership at all levels, creating what Tichy characterizes as a &quot;leadership engine.&quot;<br />Corbin's objective is to help her reader take her or his organization &quot;to the top in five revolutionary steps.&quot; In the first chapter, she provides (Figure 1.1) a &quot;Leadership Level Evaluation Exercise&quot; which poses 22 questions. The respondent is thus able to calculate her or his score and thereby determine at which of two levels of leadership she or he is at the moment. Corbin then shifts her attention to the five &quot;revolutionary steps&quot; to which the book's subtitle refers. They are:<br />1. Orchestrate a 360 Degree Worldview (Chapters 1-3)<br />2. Order the Chaos (Chapters 4-6)<br />3. Blend Multiple Organizational Models (Chapters 7-9)<br />4. Engage the Whole Person (Chapter 10)<br />5. Ignite Innovation (Chapter 11)<br />Each of these steps is explained and then developed in detail. It is important to note that Corbin contrasts dominant characterizes of Level 1 and Level 2 leaders. For example, L1's react, emphasize hard skills, gather information, and manage positions whereas L2's strategize, focus on the whole person, lead at warp speed, and manage people flow. You get the idea. My own experience suggests that what Corbin calls a Level 1 leader is a believer and involved whereas a Level 2 leader is a zealot or evangelist and engaged. I urge you to check out a book which is entirely devoted to Level 2 leaders. Its title is Radicals and Visionaries, written by Thaddeus Wawro and now available in a paperback edition.<br />One of the book's most valuable chapters is the last, &quot;Trumping the Competition&quot;, in which Corbin suggests that the Organizational Chaos Model (Figure 4.1) can help an organization to overcome its competition. &quot;The goal is for your organization to change the rules, structure, and speed of its industry so that your competitors are thrown into chaos....The idea is to confuse the enemy. While the opponent is digging out of the confusion, the organization in the offensive position seizes the dominant position.&quot; She lists and then briefly discusses &quot;The Nine Factors of Innovation&quot; which can help to achieve such dominance, in process providing analyses of various industries to illustrate her key points. She concludes with a call to action, urging her reader to &quot;execute boldly, step forward courageously, and lead responsibly as if your organization's prosperity depends on it -- because it does.&quot; I join her in wishing &quot;Godspeed, great leader.&quot;portant to note that Corbin contrasts dominant characterizes of Level 1 and Level 2 leaders.

And what if the CEO then said \\"Here are our highest-ranking executives. On the ballot provided to you, list the three you most respect and trust, those whom you most want to work for.\\" My guess (obviously only a guess) is that the decisions made by those who respond in the hypothetical situation just described would be determined by perceptions of qualities such as the 21 which Maxwell affirms. For example, character, commitment, communication, courage, positive attitude, and what Maxwell calls \\"servanthood.\\"<br />Think about history's greatest leaders in government, the military, religion, and athletics as well as in business. Do they not all share most (if not all) of the 21 qualities which Maxwell examines in this book? And did they not attract substantial numbers of voluntary (key word) followers who shared their vision, believed in them, and often followed them through incredibly difficult circumstances which were often life- or at least career-threatening? The most demanding person I ever worked for not only expected excellence, he demanded it. I would present a proposal which was 98% perfect and he always found the 2% weak spot. He was almost impossible to satisfy. Over time, I became obsessed with not disappointing him. And over time I realized that what I thought were wholly unrealistic expectations of me (and others) were based on his certainty that I (and they) could meet standards which seemed impossible.<br />Presumably Maxwell agrees with me that a leader does a great disservice to everyone involved when accepting (thereby condoning) an individual's shoddy performance or inappropriate behavior. This point is made over and over again in Buckingham and Coffman's First, Break All the Rules. The greatest managers are so demanding because they care so much about those for whom they are responsible. Many times, great managers have greater faith in their people's capabilities and potentialities than those people have in themselves.<br />I highly recommend this book because it makes an eloquent affirmation of values which have proven indispensable to all great leaders throughout human history. I also recommend it so highly because I am absolutely convinced that those same values, together, provide a practical guide to achieving personal fulfillment in marriage, parenthood, and all other relationships. Unless and until you become the person you yourself would voluntarily, indeed eagerly follow, it is highly doubtful that anyone else will.Many times, great managers have greater faith in their people's capabilities and potentialities than those people have in themselves. <br />I highly recommend this book because it makes an eloquent affirmation of values which have proven indispensable to all great leaders throughout human history.

This is especially true of visitors to Web sites. As Nielsen brilliant explains and then convincingly demonstrates, &quot;web usability&quot; is another application of the KISS Principle. He has written two books which &quot;attack the problem of usable web design from two angles. This first one is about the 'what' of good websites, and the second is about the 'how.'...This book explains what is known about the properties of easy-to-use websites. Short preview: Relish simplicity, and focus on the users' goals rather than glitzy design.&quot; He guides his reader through various phase of web design (page design, content design, and the design of the overall architecture) and then shifts the reader's attention to &quot;special issues&quot; such as intranets, users with disabilities, and international users. Nielsen concludes his book with a &quot;view toward the future of the Internet and new developments on the Web.&quot;<br />Who will derive the greatest value from reading this book? My hunch (only a hunch) is the owner/CEO of a small-to-midsize company which has not as yet launched a Web site, or, which has done so and the Web site has not achieved its objectives thus far. Whether designing a Web site or a residence, the same basic question must first be answered: Why? More specifically, how will it be used? By whom? To serve which specific purposes? To accomplish what? And at what cost? Nielsen observes, &quot;usability rules the Web. Simply stated, if the customer can't find a product, then he or she will not buy it. The Web is the ultimate customer-empowered environment. He or she who clicks the mouse gets to decide [italics] everything. it is so easy to go elsewhere; all the competitors in the world are but a mouseclick away.&quot; The challenge, then, to maximize the &quot;usability&quot; of a Web site for those who are attracted to it. Research data reveal that a substantial majority of those who go on-line visit only ten Web sites 90% of the time. Presumably those who are only one-time visitors had an unsatisfactory experience. Getting them to return may not be impossible but is certainly very, very difficult.<br />Nielsen explains that &quot;There are essentially two basic approaches to design: the artistic ideal of expressing yourself and the engineering ideal of solving a problem for a customer. This book is firmly on the side of engineering.&quot; He correctly realizes that today, this moment, the patience of a Web site visitor is measured in seconds. &quot;This book is full of specific methods that can be used at almost every stage of a web project to dramatically enhance the the user experience.&quot; That's true. Nielsen does indeed provide an abundance of information, observations, caveats, and suggestions but all of them presuppose the constant practice of simplicity in both planning and execution of strategies and tactics.<br />Who else will derive substantial value from this book? Decision-makers in much larger organizations (especially those involved on a global basis) who are hard at work on projects whose success depends directly or indirectly, on the usability of their organization's Web site. Specifically, those who are formulating or revising initiatives to improve CRM, employee recruitment and retention, allocation of resources, logistics, internal and external communications, contingency planning and crisis management, and cycle time reduction. In other words, decision-makers who are determined to maximize usability in literally every area of operations. Yes, this is a book about the Web but the Web, ultimately, is about everything and everyone involved in every organization, regardless of its size and nature.hallenge, then, to maximize the &quot;usability&quot; of a Web site for those who are attracted to it.

Almost everyone continues to experience information overload. Some who have studied this phenomenon invoke metaphors such as &quot;blizzards&quot; of data. Meanwhile, information providers struggle to get through &quot;blizzards&quot; to reach those who are most important to them. How to attract their attention? Then, how to capture that attention with what has been described as &quot;stickiness&quot;? After conducting an extensive research project, Davenport and Beck conclude that attention is &quot;the new currency of business.&quot; Perhaps Wolf agrees, having written a brilliant book about &quot;the entertainment economy&quot;; perhaps Pine and Gilmore also agree, having written a book about &quot;the experience economy.&quot;<br />At the beginning of most of his plays, Shakespeare uses various devices to attract an audience's attention so that its members could then be entertained. (The play Hamlet begins with a question &quot;Who's there?&quot; The audience settles down, curious to learn the answer.) In today's marketplace, merchants such as Starbucks and Williams-Sonoma do everything possible (and appropriate) to attract attention by appealing to several of the senses. (The fragrant aroma of Starbucks' gourmet coffee can be experienced by many of those in the bookstore nearby.) Especially now with so many people online, there is what so many have observed as &quot;too much information&quot; or at least &quot;not enough time&quot; to absorb and digest the information available.<br />Davenport and Beck organize their material within 12 chapters which range from &quot;A New Perspective on Business (Welcome to the Attention Economy)&quot; to &quot;From Myopia to Utopia (The Future of the Attention Economy).&quot; They explain why understanding and managing attention is now the single most important determinant of business success. They examine with rigor and eloquence three different types of &quot;attention technologies&quot;: attention-getting, attention-structuring, and attention-protecting. They explain why companies will no longer be proud of how extensive their knowledge portals are, but rather of how targeted an information environment they create. (Davenport and Beck fully understand that &quot;targets&quot; are constantly moving; also, that the prioritization of &quot;targets&quot; is an on-going process to accommodate change.) Throughout the book, they also insert dozens of &quot;Principles.&quot; Here are three examples:<br />&quot;Types Principle: Six basic units of currency are exchanged in an attention market, each emphasizing a specific target of focused mental engagement.&quot;<br />NOTE: These &quot;basic units&quot; are Captive and Voluntary, Aversive and Attractive, and finally, Front-of-Mind and Back-of-Mind. They are discussed in detail in Chapter 2, one of the book's most thought-provoking chapters.<br />&quot;Tap or Bottle Principle: The most important function of attention isn't taking information in, but screening it out.&quot;<br />&quot;Action! Principle: Hollywood studio executives understand their audience before they make a play for their attention, and they manipulate setting, segmentation, and culture to hold onto it.&quot;<br />The authors suggest that the trend of more information competing for less attention cannot go on forever. &quot;Ultimately, people will begin to withdraw from the stress of an attention-devouring world, and information providers will begin to focus on quality, not quantity.&quot; Each delivery day, I immediately toss (unopened) all unwanted items in the U.S. mail; I systematically delete (unread) all unwanted e-mail messages, and politely but quickly end all telephone solicitations. Everyone I know responds the same way in these situations.

At the beginning of each of the book's 15 chapters, he identifies \\"team leaders\\" who personify the qualities of leadership examined in that chapter; then at the end of each chapter, he provides a summary of key points, \\"The Founding Fathers on Leadership.\\" Phillips is perhaps most eloquent when, in the Epilogue, he observes: \\"Clearly the founding fathers cleverly and shrewdly designed democracy to foster the art and process of leadership. And in the final analysis, the principles of leadership are nothing less than the principles of humanity: treating people with respect and dignity; raising awareness; creating a vision and involving others; bonding together through alliances and teamwork; risking all; learning from mistakes; refusing to lose; inspiring rather than coercing; listening; compromising; caring; ever changing and ever achieving.\\"<br /><br />Throughout his book, Phillips includes hundreds of specific examples of these qualities of leadership as they are revealed in the recorded thoughts, feelings, and (especially) the actions of the various founding fathers. He recalls many memorable moments such as when (in 1796) Washington stopped at Valley Forge one last time en route to Mount Vernon and encountered a farmer named Woodman, a veteran of the Continental Army who had also endured the harsh winter at Valley Forge. According to Phillips' account, the farmer greeted his former commander. Of course, no one knows what was said but it can be assumed that each had special significance for the other when meeting at what has since become a national shrine.<br /><br />There are hundreds (thousands?) of books about \\"leadership\\" now available and countless more yet to be written. The best of them, by assertion or by implication, focus on many of the same values which Phillips reveals in such abundance among the founding fathers. To his credit, Phillips suggests rather than imposes the correlations he sees between leaders of the American Revolution and those who most effectively lead organizations in the 21st century. Obviously, their respective circumstances are substantially different in many respects but all of them share certain basic values previously indicated. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to consult the remarkably eclectic \\"Bibliography\\" which Phillips provides. To those works I presume add the separate biographies of John Adams by Ellis and McCullough as well as Ferling's Setting the World Ablaze and O'Toole's The Executive Compass.fathers.

Why is it featured here?<br /><br />After a two-year study of the key strategic decisions that most often determine growth or stagnation in business, Zook (with Allen) realized that clients of Bain & Company were eager to share the results of that study. Only later did he decide to write this book, one in which he presents and then develops \\"a useful framework for understanding and addressing the key decision points encountered in growing a business.\\" He concluded that this framework is practical and could be applied (with appropriate modification) within almost any organization. In the Preface, Zook acknowledges that he was surprised by some of the findings which he briefly identifies. He then observes: \\"Central to our findings are three ideas: the concept of the core  business and its boundaries; the idea that every business has a level of full-potential performance that usually exceeds what the company imagines; and the idea that performance-yield loss occurs at many levels, from strategy to leadership to organizational capabilities to execution.\\" In the five chapters which follow, Zook (with Allen) examines \\"the types of strategic business decisions that most often seem to tilt the odds of future success or failure.\\" Zook correctly suggests in this book that many organizations cannot resist the appeal (\\"the siren's song\\") of \\"miracle cures\\" of their problems. Zook focuses entirely on what has been verified in real-world experience, on what is practical, and on what will reliably achieve the desired results of sound strategic decisions.<br /><br />He and his associates learned a great deal from the study, confiding that \\"some of the results were quite counterintuitive to us.\\" Several of the findings caught my eye and caused me to challenge a few of my own cherished assumptions. For example,  that \\"the choice of the next hot industry was much less important in driving growth and profitability over the long term than were strategy, competitive position, reinvesting rates, and execution.\\" They also learned that many of the most successful sustained growth companies are actually in lower growth businesses (e.g. Enron in energy, ServiceMaster in basic services, and Bechtel in engineering). Why? Zook suggests that \\"it might be precisely the difficulty of of these market environments that elicits superior business creativity in the search for new growth out of their core businesses.\\" In other words, these companies ignored \\"the siren's song\\" and stuck to the aforementioned \\"basics\\": strategy, competitive position, reinvesting rates, and execution. In the last chapter, Zook quotes Sun Tzu: \\"The more opportunities that I seize, the more opportunities that multiply before me.\\" He then asserts that this phenomenon \\"is at the heart of growth strategy and embodies the fundamental tension between protecting the core [i.e. `the basics'] and driving into more and better adjacencies, propelled by greater and greater success.\\"<br /><br />The various mini-case studies provided are very informative. I also appreciative the dozens of check lists (e.g. \\"Ten Key Questions for Management\\"), charts (e.g. 3-1 \\"Adjacencies Radiate from the Core\\"), and chapter \\"Conclusion\\" sections, all of which serve two important functions: they distill key ideas, and, they can serve as helpful reminders when reviewed later. Obviously, the \\"goal posts\\" in today's business world approach and then withdraw, widen and then narrow, with sometimes maddening unpredictability. Wait until they are closer for an easier kick or kick now (\\"carpe diem\\") before they begin to back up? Wait until they are wider? What if they become narrower? This metaphorical situation is complicated by the fact that opponents are trying to block the kick in what may well be inclement weather or at least against the wind. Kick now or wait?<br /><br />One of the most interesting concepts shared in this book is what Zookrefers to as \\"The Alexander Problem.\\" Briefly, Alexander the Great and his armies eventually conquered an area stretching from Mount Olympus to Mount Everest. That was accomplished in less than four years. His resources became overextended. \\"His sticking point -- the failure to anchor in the core business (in his case, governance) and consolidate a rapid expansion --exemplifies the most common problem across all growth strategy\\": pursuing the wrong adjacency opportunities. With Alexander's premature death, his empire died with him. He was its core. The same is true of countless companies which expand into related segments which do not utilize, much less reinforce, the strength of their profitable core. \\"Business adjacencies are growth opportunities that follow a company to extend the boundaries of its core business. What distinguishes an adjacency from another growth opportunity is the extent to which it draws on the customer relationships, technologies, or skills in the core business to build competitive advantage in a new, adjacent, competitive area.\\" Have you ever wondered why at least 70% of all mergers and acquisitions either fail or perform well below expectations? The board members and senior-level executives of those organizations obviously had not read Zook's analysis of \\"The Alexander Problem\\" in Chapter 3.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Crawford and Matthews'  The Myth of Excellence, Fitz-enz's The E-Aligned Enterprise as well as The ROI of Human Capital, and Collins & Porras' Built to Last.Problem.\\" Briefly, Alexander the Great and his armies eventually conquered an area stretching from Mount Olympus to Mount Everest.

1897837:US	51147790	R2WT3486PERPY	0787902438	487617967	The Connective Edge: Leading in an Interdependent World (Jossey Bass Business & Management Series)	Books	5	12	14	N	N	Wisdom, Eloquence, and Circumspection	As those who have read Hot Groups already know, Lipman-Blumen is one of the most innovative thinkers now commenting on the contemporary business world. With this book, she makes a substantial and truly significant contribution to our understanding of several separate but interdependent issues: leadership, connectivity, human development, intellectual capital, strategic alliances (both internal and external), and organizational transformation. Yes, yes, I know. There are hundreds of other books already published which discuss several of the same subjects and many of them are first-rate, as Lipman-Blumen would be the first to acknowledge. All of them are listed in her superb \\"References\\" section and key ideas from several are woven into her crisp narrative. One of the several reasons why this book is different is the provision and explanation of what she calls \\"The Connective Leadership Model\\" which is the focus of Part II. Typical of Lipman-Blumen, she does not suggest that hers is the only model to consider; in fact, she strongly urges her reader to correlate her or his organizations needs and interests with the structure of the model, selecting whatever is most important. However, I presume to offer a caveat: Although by now an overworked buzz word, \\"integration\\" of any combination of components is absolutely essential. Whatever the model, its components must be cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective as are those which comprise \\"The Connective Leadership Model.\\"<br />Wisely, following a precise and eloquent Preface, Lipman-Blumen focuses in Part One on \\"The Changing Dynamics of Leadership\\" which, inevitably, have changed at least to some extent since she wrote this book, first published in 1996. Nonetheless, her rationale remains rock-solid. Then and now, organizations need (and will continue to need) leadership which is \\"more politically savvy and instrumental, yet more ethical, authentic, accountable, and particularly, more ennobling.\\" She calls this new approach \\"connective leadership\\" and suggests that it can \\"potentially transform the destructive tensions of diversity and interdependence into constructive leadership action.\\" I hasten to add that, in most organizations where leaders tend to be identified by title, political and economic leverage, degree of authority, the \\"connective leadership\\" to which she refers can -- and should -- include everyone involved in a given organization. Stated another way, what she seems to be advocating is what I call \\"collaborative initiative\\" which can (and should) function at all levels. Those organizations which achieve and then sustain such initiatives (e.g. Southwest Airliners) have a \\"connective edge\\" over their competition.  Lipman- Blumen provides an excellent discussion of this point in Chapter 10 and Noel Tichy also has much of value to say about this in his own book,  The Leadership Engine.<br />Lipman-Blumen organizes her material within three Parts: The Changing Dynamics of Leadership (a review and examination of \\"the origins and evolution of the human need for leadership\\"), The Connective Leadership Model (more about that in a moment), and Bridging to the Stage 3 World (an exploration of the \\"empirical organizational results and the philosophical implications of the Connective Leadership Model\\"). The nature of leadership which she advocates is \\"both provocative and savvy, yet pragmatic and honorable.\\" I wish it were possible to reproduce in this brief commentary the model she presents in Part Two. Essentially, it consists of three separate but interdependent components:<br />DIRECT : The intrinsic, competitive, and power styles of leadership<br />RELATIONAL: The collaborative, contributory, and vicarious styles of leadership<br />INSTRUMENTAL: The personal, social, and entrusting styles of leadership<br />Lipman-Blumen correctly points out that the most effective leaders are those who possess an appropriate combination of all three. As I read Part Two, I thought about the striking differences between the leadership styles of Gandhi and Patton. Relying entirely on active (not passive) strategies and tactics of non-violence, Gandhi helped India to achieve independence. Patton was required to use entirely different strategies and tactics to rescue the American troops at Bastogne. For me, one of this book's most insightful chapters is Chapter 11, \\"Women Leaders: An Oxymoron? Or Does Gender Make a Difference?\\" Lipman-Blumen poses and then addresses a number of gender-specific issues. Once again, as I read this chapter, I thought about leaders such as Joan of Arc, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Elizabeth I, and Catherine the Great...each of whom possessed a combination of direct, relational, and instrumental leadership styles in appropriate balance. That was their \\"connective edge.\\"<br />Within the context of explaining the need for what she calls \\"connective\\" leadership, Lipman-Blumen examines the theme of the contradictory pulls of  two global tensions, interdependence and diversity. The former demands collaboration and mutuality while often seeming to  threaten the independence and individualism required by the latter. \\"Connective\\" leadership is needed to integrate or at least coordinate these two sometimes adversarial forces. The leader with a &quot;connective eye&quot; can help groups or parties who must work or live interdependently (through geography, industry, etc.) with those who often have quite different agendas and goals, to focus together on problems that the enlightened leader recognizes they share even when, especially when others don't &quot;get it.\\" Lipman-Blumen believes that these two global tensions will be with us for some time to come. Leaders who don't develop the understanding and skills to deal with them effectively are almost certain to fail. I am reminded of what Edison once said about innovation: It is the ability to make connections. That is as true of the Gaza Strip as it is of an incandescent light.<br />I highly recommend this book to senior-level executives, of course, who seek that \\"edge\\" for themselves as well as for their organizations. But I also highly recommend this book to others whom Lipman-Blumen may not have had primarily in mind when she wrote the book: Clergy, teachers, coaches, and (especially) parents. Youth ages (let's say) 6-16 also have a great need for the \\"connective\\" leadership which Lipman-Blumen advocates. The impact of their leadership on young people may well have much greater impact than that of anyone else, especially now when the world is more interdependent than at any prior time in human history.he striking differences between the leadership styles of Gandhi and Patton.

What sets this book apart from most others is the fact that, rather than use the interview format, the Boyetts organize their material within six thematic chapters: Should You Do It?, The Perfect Idea, Money Matters, getting Customers, Keeping Customers, and Managing People. As they explain in their Introduction, \\"You hold in your hand a digest of the best thinking about what it takes to start your own business and succeed, but we have designed this to be more than just a digest. It also provides you with a much needed cross-reference to the best thinking about the key issues in starting and running a business.\\" That's true. It is also true that almost any other senior-level managers of well-established organizations (including global corporations) can also derive substantial benefit from such \\"best thinking.\\" Consider these brief remarks by Jack Welch when explaining what GE can learn from entrepreneurial companies:<br />\\"For one, they communicate better. Without the din and prattle of bureaucracy, people listen as well as talk; and since there are fewer of them they generally know and understand each other. Second, small companies move faster. They know the penalties for hesitation in the marketplace. Third, in small companies, with fewer layers and less camouflage, the leaders show up very clearly on the screen. Their performance and its impact are clear to everyone. And, finally, smaller companies waste less. They spend less time in endless reviews and approvals and politics and paper drills. They have fewer people; therefore they can only do the important things. Their people are free to direct their energy and attention toward the  marketplace rather than fighting bureaucracy.\\"<br />These remarks are especially relevant to several of the \\"gurus\\" whom the Boyetts feature, including Paul Allen and Bill Gates, Mary Kay Ash, Jeffrey R. Bezos, Warren Buffett, Walt Disney, Wayne Huizenga, Steven Jobs, Herb Kelleher, Tom Monaghan, Ross Perot, Ted Turner, and Sam Walton...all of whom created multi-billion dollar global corporations with visionary and tenacious entrepreneurship.

In Chapter 1, for example, Ghadar and Leonard \\"deliberate on how the digital economy is forcing a fundamental and permanent shift in the way enterprise strategies are developed, and in the process raise significant new challenges for managers. In Chapter 7, Bhargava and Lee \\"provide valuable insights about emerging technologies and practices that will help organizations remain open and flexible in response to the changing technological environment so that past information technology investments remain useful and valuable in the future.\\" And in the final chapter, Loomis and Gerhard \\"identify several strategic issues facing executives who must lead or interact within the e-government environment.\\" All manner of forces are driving the expansion and consequent complexity of the \\"digital frontier\\" and at an ever-increasing velocity. Here in a single source are a range and diversity of perspectives on this process. The editors are to be commended on the selection and presentation of the 14 separate but inter-related essays.

However, new vendors are entering the field daily. For example, for the technology I discuss in the Epiloque, alternative payment systems, I received three press releases in the week before the book went to the printer. In fact, this book has been difficult to write because I have never felt that any chapter was finished.\\" Nor could one be. There are several reasons why I thus begin this brief commentary. First, to indicate that Gutzman focuses on \\"must-have technologies\\" rather than on, for example, specific strategies and tactics. Also, to indicate (as does she) how rapidly circumstances in the \\"digital arena\\" can change. Finally, to suggest that a Web site is never \\"finished.\\" Gutzman organizes her material within five Parts: The E-Commerce Climate, Technologies for Driving Traffic, Technologies for Making Buying Easier, Technologies for Customer Service, and finally, Turnkey Growth. Of special interest to me are the various \\"Case Studies\\" of exemplar companies and technology applications. Also various \\"Profiles\\" such as those of \\"Net Perceptions\\", \\"Soliloquy\\" and \\"BroadVision\\", each of which briefly discusses specific functions, features, and benefits of specific technologies. As a non-technical person, I commend Gutzman on creating access for me to subjects which can sometimes be daunting, if not intimidating.<br />Gutzman's is a \\"three-pronged strategy\\" for meeting your demands: implement essential technologies, maintain a flexible business model, and outsource everything. Think of the material in her book as if it were on display in a store which you enter, tool box in hand. Roam the aisles. Examine various clusters of items. She is your expert advisor as well as the store's proprietress. (I strongly suspect that she had this metaphor in mind when writing the book.) Over time, all of your questions are answered. She helps you to make appropriate selections. In process, she has helped you to understand not only what you need and how to use it but also why you need it. Effective use of the 12 \\"must have\\" technologies will drive traffic to the Web site, create and sustain Web site functionality, and facilitate customer service which ensures that the Web site will be ETDBW (Easy to Do Business With). In the Epilogue, Gutzman adds another \\"must have\\" technology: alternative payment systems.<br />For whom will this book be most valuable? First, I highly recommend it to decision-makers in small-to-midsize organizations which already have or are now developing a Web site. The more they know and the more they understand, the better prepared they will be to select and then work with vendors. (NOTE: Reputable vendors will welcome such expertise because it enables them to accomplish more for their client and in less time. The same expertise will enable decision-makers to recognize disreputable vendors, either immediately or soon thereafter. That one benefit all by itself is worth at least ten times the cost of the book and probably a great deal more.)  I also strongly recommend this book to decision-makers in larger organizations because, in the \\"digital arena\\", they will be expected (if not required) to gain a literacy in the technologies which Gutzman examines. Also, these same decision-makers will become progressively more involved in business initiatives (marketing, client relationships, strategic planning, market research, etc.) which the \\"must have\\" technologies support.

My personal favorites are Murphy's \\"What Is Branding\\" which provides a basic but precise introductory briefing on the subject. He concludes by noting that branding is a creative process. \\"It uses research techniques and the skills of a number of specialists. But in the end it is about creating distinctness -- in a consumer-relevant fashion.\\" I also admire Fogg's analysis of \\"Brands as Intellectual Property.\\" (Those who share have a special interest in this subject are urged to check out Lessig's Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace.)

They remain rock-solid. His objective is to suggest how to \\"make the most of change\\" and heaven knows there have been so many major changes, both global and local, in recent years. I expect the nature and number of such turmoil to increase significantly, and, to occur at an ever-accelerating velocity. I also expect Bridges' observations and suggestions to remain valid. Perhaps at some point he will revise this book to accommodate certain changes such as the emergence of what Pink calls \\"the free agent nation.\\" The book's materiel is carefully organized within four Parts:<br />The Problem [Bridges provides \\"a new and useful perspective on the difficulties ahead\\" and then a test case which illustrates that perspective]<br />The Solutions [Bridges suggests all manner of ways to apply what is learned from the previous Part]<br />Dealing with Nonstop Change in the Organization and Your Life [Bridges suggests a number of strategies by which to cope with rapid change, both organizationally and personally]<br />In 1991, Bridges was convinced that it is impossible to achieve any desired objectives without getting to \\"the personal stuff\\"; the challenge is to get people to stop doing whatever \\"the old way\\" and that cannot be accomplished impersonally. He was also convinced that transition management requires experience and abilities we already possess as when we struggle, for example, to \\"figure out a tactful response in a difficult situation.\\"  However, the strategies of transition management he suggests may require mastery of certain techniques which we \\"can easily learn.\\" Presumably Bridges remains convinced today of these same basic points even as new applications and (yes) complications have revealed themselves.<br />For whom will this book be most valuable? Given the nature and extent of organizational change, I would include everyone engaged (voluntarily or involuntarily) in those changes...at least everyone at the management level. Also, service providers such bankers, attorneys, accountants, bankers, executive recruiters, and management consultants such as I who are directly associated with those organizations. On several occasions, Drucker has brilliantly discussed the challenge of managing a future which has already occurred but perhaps has not as yet been recognized. I agree with him that that is indeed a major challenge. One of Bridges' key points seems to be that it is not only possible but imperative to manage effectively the transition from a current situation to a desired destination. It is not always possible to \\"manage change\\" but I agree with Bridges that it IS possible to formulate and then manage an appropriate response to it. Those who share my high regard for this book are encouraged to read (if they have not already done so) Bridges' previous work, Transitions, as well as O'Toole's Managing Change, Katzenbach's Real Change Leaders, and finally, The Manager as Change Agent co-authored by Quatro, Hoekstra, Whittle, Gilley, and Maycunich.ne engaged (voluntarily or involuntarily) in those changes...at least everyone at the management level.

You get my point. The authors of this book focus on a major challenge to all organizations: keeping customers, especially now when \\"the competition is just a click away.\\" Customer retention is the name of this \\"game\\" and almost everyone within a given organization is a \\"player.\\"<br />Zemke and Connellan organize their excellent material within fourteen chapters, presenting and then explaining 24 \\"key\\" strategies to maximize customer retention. These \\"keys\\" range from \\"Master the ETDBW [i.e. Easy to Do Business With] Design Basics\\" in Chapter 5 to \\"Use Incentives to Increase Spending\\" in Chapter 11. They then provide \\"A Seven-Lesson Crash Course in E-Service Improvement\\" in Chapter 12 followed by a thought-provoking chapter \\"The Future of the Net: Take These Predictions to the Bank\\" and, in the final chapter, a \\"Browser's Guide\\" which offers 80 \\"tips\\" such as \\"the long-term winners...will be those that have done the best job of supporting their customers and delivering that value in a way that seems effortless.\\" I also appreciate the inclusion of \\"Notes\\" and \\"Additional Resources.\\"<br />For small-to-midsize organizations especially, here in a single-volume are information and guidance sufficient to assist the design, launch, implementation, and refinement of an e-business customer service program. I think this book can also be of substantial value to much larger organizations which, I am convinced, should constantly re-evaluate such a program already in place. Recall the \\"bias\\" to which I referred earlier. Recent market research (generated by several million respondents) has revealed what is most important to customers: \\"feeling appreciated\\" and \\"ease of doing business\\" (or \\"convenience\\") were ranked either #1 or #2 among the attributes. Revealingly, \\"cost\\" is ranked anywhere between #9 and #14.<br />Do Zemke and Donnellan address all the \\"right\\" questions? No, but they don't miss many.  Are all of their answers to various questions the \\"right\\" ones?  Read the book and judge for yourself. In fact, I urge you to consult a number of other books which cover much of the same material. It would be imprudent (perhaps even stupid) to rely entirely on a single source. The authors identify several in the \\"Additional Resources\\" section to which I presume to add Treacy and Wiersema's The Discipline of Market Leaders (who have a great deal of value to say about \\"customer intimacy\\") as well as Customer Equity co-authored by Blattberg, Getz, and Thomas who provide a brilliant analysis of what could be called \\"the ROI of customer relationships.\\"tantly re-evaluate such a program already in place.

There are several excellent books on the subject, including this one. Also Breyfogle's Implementing Six Sigma and its sequel, Managing Six Sigma, co-authored with Cupello and Meadows. For those who know nothing about Six Sigma, I suggest they first read what I describe as a \\"primer\\", Chowdhury's The Power of Six Sigma.<br />Of course, these and other books are essentially worthless unless and until dedcision-makers in an organization have both sufficient resources and a shared commitment to learn from the relevant experiences of others. I realize that there are at least some executives now involved with organizations whose senior-management is unwilling and/or unable to commit sufficient resources. Nonetheless, many may wish to understand what Six Sigma is (and isn't), and, how certain companies have used Six Sigma principles to thrive (e.g. Motorola, GE, and Allied-Signal). Eckes invites his reader to accompany him on \\"the pragmatic journey through a new management approach that is helping drive productivity and profits....[one whose focus is on] the involvement of management at all levels of an organization.\\"  He addresses the elements management must institute to create an infrastructure for Six Sigma to work. \\"The second major component of Six Sigma addresses the tactics that drive improved effectiveness and efficiency in an organization. This method uses a simple but detailed approach to improve the performance of existing processes.\\"<br />Eckes presents the material within ten chapters whose titles correctly indicate their primary focus:<br />Introduction to Six Sigma<br />The Strategy of Six Sigma: Eight Step[s to Strategic Improvement<br />Profits = Customer + Process + Employee<br />Project Start-up: Tactical Six Sigma<br />Measuring Project Sigma: How Close Are You to Perfection?<br />Data and Process Analysis: the Keys to the project<br />Root Cause Analysis: Never Stop Asking \\"Why\\"<br />Selecting Solutions That Drive Sigma Performance<br />Holding the Gains: Making Sure Your Solutions Stick<br />How Six Sigma Initiatives and How to Avoid Mistakes<br />In the final chapter, Eckes identifies a number of \\"concerns\\" (e.g. \\"The Key to Six Sigma Is Statistics, Statistics, Statistics\\") and then cross-references specific  strategies and tactics which address those concerns. He also includes a boxed summary of \\"Key Learnings\\" which I found especially valuable within the context of the \\"critical mistakes\\" which so many companies have made and, presumably, others will make. I agree with Eckes and countless others that the most valuable lessons are learned from a rigorous analysis of  failure. The career of Thomas Edison clearly indicates the differences between \\"efficient\\" and :\\"effective.\\" His failure-to-success ratio was probably 100-1. Perfection is a destination, not a journey. A majority of the companies which have designed and then implemented a Six Sigma program eventually abandon that journey. When examining the ten \\"Concerns\\", Eckes helps his reader to understand why.<br />Ultimately, in my opinion, Six Sigma is an educational experience which requires rigor, passion, precision, dexterity, determination (indeed tenacity) and above all, patience. There is obviously a great deal to be learned from companies such as GE, Motorola, and Allied-Signal, of course, but one of the most important points Eckes makes in this book is that the knowledge of greatest value is what can be learned from and within one's own organization.

1908596:US	51147790	R1R4SWZGSQZHOR	0738204625	886793161	The Manager as Change Agent: A Practical Guide to Developing High-Performance People and Organizations	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Your Own Yellow Brick Road Awaits	One of the many benefits of visiting Amazon.com's &quot;Books&quot; section is having the opportunity to check out Customer Reviews, many of which include suggestions for other sources. The Amazonians themselves include a sub-section which I consult daily and greatly appreciate: &quot;Customers who bought this also bought...&quot; I mention all this at the outset because I think it is a serious mistake (or at least silly) to characterize any one book on a given subject as THE book to buy. This is especially true of the subject of change agency. Without any effort, I can immediately think of at least 10-12 which are brilliantly developed, eloquently written, and of enduring value. I include this book among them. Does it ask most of the right questions? Yes. Are all of its answers definitive? No. The subtitle is precise and accurate: This book offers a thoughtful and cohesive guide to &quot;developing high-performance people and organizations.&quot;<br />After an introductory chapter (&quot;Becoming a Change Agent&quot;), the authors organize their excellent material within three Parts: Beyond the Smoke and Mirrors; then Philosophy, Practice, and Responsibilities of a Change Agent; and finally, Integrating Resources, Roles, and Competencies. By the time I reached the end of this book, I realized that one of the greatest benefits to be derived from it is especially relevant to owners/CEOs of smaller companies. A majority of those I have worked closely with are the only change agent in their respective organizations. This book will help them to develop change agency competence among many of those whom they supervise. Of course, the book will also be of great value to senior-level executives in large organizations, including non-profits.<br />For me, one of the most entertaining as well as informative chapters in the book is Chapter 4 (&quot;Beware of Flying Monkeys and Poison Poppies&quot;) in which the authors suggest correlations between the adventures encountered by Dorothy and her companions en route to the Emerald City and what all managers encounter in today's business world. &quot;Flying monkeys are those unexpected characters, events, and situations that jump up and attack you at the most untimely moments.....Flying monkeys come in all shapes, sorts, and sizes. They can be people, events, activities, and attitudes....Perhaps the most important potential monkey for you to be aware of is the cultural flying monkey. [As the authors have explained earlier in the book], culture is defined as the underlying beliefs, values, and assumptions held by members of an organization and the practices and behaviors that exemplify and reinforce them. In other words, 'the way we do things around here.'&quot; In Figure 4.1, detailed information about &quot;Miscellaneous Flying Monkeys&quot; is provided within an ingenious grid. With regard to &quot;poison poppies&quot;, the authors suggest that so many change initiatives fail because managers are &quot;seduced by the promise of a quick fix&quot;, a short-cut, etc. Time and again when retained by a corporate client to help solve problems, I find that the client's managers are preoccupied with the symptoms of problems rather than focused on determining the causes of those problems. Stated another way, many managers seem to think that wet highways cause rain.<br />The authors begin Chapter 11 with a quote from John Kotter (&quot;A good rule of thumb in a major change effort is: Never underestimate the magnitude of the forces that reinforce complacency and that help maintain the status quo&quot;) and then use Figure 11.01 to illustrate what they call a &quot;Holistic Model for Change Agent Excellence&quot; featuring the brain, the heart, courage, and vision. All are necessary to overcome the aforementioned &quot;forces.&quot; More specifically:<br />1. Provide strong, highly visible, and personal leadership<br />2. Institute employee involvement early and often, at all levels<br />3. Build a clearly articulated, shared vision<br />4. Provide frequent, consistent, and open communication<br />5. Leverage talented, and trusted employees as co-change agents<br />6. Set measurable operational and behavioral goals<br />7.

The authors no only explain how; they also explain why.<br />Appropriately, the authors conclude their brilliant book as follows: &quot;As in [italics] The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy's vision was to somehow return to her beloved Kansas.

The other news is that it has imposed a pace of life that is almost intolerable.\\" The material is organized within five Parts.<br />* Enfolding the World<br />Fitz-enz explains how and why today's marketplace is changing from the old, industrial world (i-world) to the new, electronic world (e-world).<br />* Leadership Imperatives in E-World<br />According to Fitz-enz, there are \\"ten imperatives of e-world leadership\\": provide a clear vision, and strategy for people to follow, communication is the first priority as well as the best tool, use stories to implant the message, champion information sharing and learning, commit to building an exciting culture, reward innovation and punish unreasonable resistance, focus on measurable results rather than processes, invest heavily in developing associates, develop a \\"can-do\\" attitude in the organization, and finally, listen to associates.<br />* Strategy Drivers: Connectivity, Innovation, Customers<br />In Chapter 7, Figure 7-2 enables the reader to assess her or his readiness for e-world; at one point in Chapter 8, Fitz-enz examines Davenport's \\"Seven Rules of Innovation\\"; and in Chapter 9, Figure 9-2 poses a series of questions which, once answered, enable the reader to learn how customers view his nor her brand.<br />* Human Capital: The E-World Lever<br />This is one of the most important sections in the book. Fitz-enz suggests differences between and similarities of i-world and e-world associates; identifies what he considers to be, for supervisors, employees' most important needs and expectations; he lists (in Figure 11-1) those factors which affect employee productivity; he then identifies and discusses those factors which drive successful programs; and then in Chapter 13, Fitz-enz suggests how to integrate knowledge management and learning organization-wide. The Human Capital Scorecard (Figure 14-1) provided in Chapter 14 consists of ten attributes to be rated on a 1-5 scale<br />* Aligning Your Enterprise for E-World<br />I was surprised to learn in Chapter 15 that the results of a General Management Technologies research study (which asked executives about their general approach to e-business and the factors behind their e-business performance) reveals that \\"both the highest and lowest performers named the same factors as keys to success.\\" Fitz-enz lists them. In the same chapter, Figure 15-3 illustrates the connections and pathways among people, knowledge, and performance. For those in need of a \\"game plan\\", this illustration offers an appropriate framework. In the final chapter, Fitz-enz focus on what he calls an \\"E-Alignment Scorecard\\" based on qualitative metrics which enable an organization's decision-makers to measure progress in the e-economy.<br />Note the logical progression from the analysis of E-World in Part I to an explanation of how to achieve organizational alignment with it in Part V. Fitz-enz then provides an Epilogue (\\"Over the Horizon\\") followed by Appendix A (\\"Three Levels of ROI Measurement\\") and Appendix B (\\"Bibliography\\"). In this book, Fitz-enz functions both as an anthropologist and as a tour guide. He shares his understanding of E-World as he accompanies his reader during a journey through it.  In the final chapter, Fitz-enz suggests that the greatest challenge for any executive \\"is to grow an organization that is balanced in all respects. It must meet the imperative of making an acceptable return on all participants' investments. Stockholders, lenders, suppliers, employees, and customers must all benefit from the executive's decision...[then in italics] Every value system has natural outputs.

Were I to provide a copy of that book to the CEOs with whom I work, few (if any) would read it. Perhaps a few would pass it along for someone else to read. After that, who knows? (Many of the CEOs I know confuse dumping with delegating.)  It is not damning with faint praise to suggest that this is an excellent book but one which has a much narrower focus and provides much less content than does its predecessor.<br />\\"The purpose of this book is to build awareness of the wise application of Six Sigma tools and how they can be important to the `big picture.'\\" The authors achieve that purpose. The material is carefully organized within four Parts: Why Six Sigma (How Six Sigma Compares to Other Quality Initiatives, Six Sigma Background and Fundamentals, and Six Sigma Needs Assessment); Six Sigma Metrics (Numbers and Information, Crafting insightful Metrics, and Performance Measurement); Six Sigma Business Strategy (deployment Alternatives, Creating a Successful Six Sigma Infrastructure, Training and Implementation, and finally, Project Selection, Sizing, and Other Techniques; and Applying Six Sigma (manufacturing Applications, Service/Transactional Applications, Development Applications, and finally, Need for Creativity, Invention, and Innovation). The Glossary and References sections follow and are first-rate.<br />Because I am a non-technician, I found the concepts and applications discussed in this book easier to grasp than those explained in its predecessor, Implementing Six Sigma. My guess (only a guess) is that the same would be true of senior-level executives who are also non-technicians. The authors quite carefully help their reader to understand how Six Sigma differs from other quality initiatives while correctly noting that Six Sigma should not replace other initiatives. Rather, it is and should be perceived as \\"a tactical methodology to determine the best approach to a given situation/process.\\" In Chapter 1, they go on to observe that the success of Six Sigma \\"is linked to qa set of cross-functional metrics that lead to significant improvements in customer satisfaction and bottom-line benefits. Organizations do not necessarily need to use all of the measurements listed (often within typical Six Sigma programs). It is most important to choose the best set of services for a situation metrics that yield insight into a situation or process.\\" I provide these brief excerpts to indicate the precision and clarity of the authors' writing style as well as to attract attention to several key points they emphasize.<br />One of the book's greatest value-added benefits is provided from a series of Tables. They range from \\"The Ten Myths of Six Sigma\\" (Table 1.1) and \\"Deming's Fourteen Points\\" (Table 1.2) through \\"The 21-Set Integration of the Tools\\" (Table 1.5) and \\"Six Sigma Needs Checklist\\" (Table 3.2) to \\"Personality Traits of Creative Individuals\\" identified by Sternberg and Lubart (Table 14.3). The authors end their book as follows: \\"As global competition increases and the rate of technological change accelerates, there will be tremendous social turmoil; as the uneducated and unprepared secede from the expanding economy. Those with the capability and desire to keep pace with radical change will find virtually limitless opportunity, growth, and prosperity.\\" Frankly, I was surprised when reading these concluding remarks because, at so many points throughout the book's narrative, the authors seem almost wholly preoccupied with explaining strategies which leverage various technologies to maximize ROI. Then I reviewed what I had read and what I had learned, realizing that even a system as cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective as S4 is certain to fail without sufficient \\"human capital.\\" That is, those to whom the authors refer.  People who are advocates, indeed evangelists.<br />Heaven knows, the authors of this book are highly analytical but they are also passionate about the difference they can help to make in organizations which need \\"a practical guide to understanding, assessing, and implementing the strategy that yields bottom-line success.\\" I commend them on what they achieve in this book...also, and of greater importance, on what their book can help others to achieve.ensive, and cost-effective as S4 is certain to fail without sufficient \\"human capital.\\" That is, those to whom the authors refer.

As the book's subtitle indicates, his primary purpose is to examine Otis Chandler during \\"the rise and fall of the L.A. dynasty.\\" (It is worth noting that the Boston Globe is now owned by the parent company of the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times is now owned by the parent company of the Chicago Tribune. Perhaps McDougal or someone else will examine those recent developments in a book yet to be written. And perhaps examine, also, recent mergers which have created media conglomerates such as AOL Time Warner.) For much of this book, the Times's various publishers dominate the narrative. Specifically,  first Harrison Otis, then Harry Chandler, then Harry's son Norman, and finally Norman's son Otis. Of equal interest to me were the roles played by various women, notably Norman's wife Buff and Otis' two wives, Missy and then Bettina. In California throughout the latter half of the twentieth century, the Chandlers established and solidified a \\"dynasty\\" but also what McDougal more correctly describes as an \\"oligarchy.\\"<br />These are among the important questions addressed in this book:<br />1. How and why did the Los Angles Times become so influential?<br />2. How and why did it later lose so much of that influence?<br />3. Precisely what role did Otis Chandler play throughout that process?<br />McDougal is especially effective when explaining the culture within which three generations of Chandlers served as publisher. For example:  \\"Like Harry, Norman understood early that the business of the Times was conducted as much in the private clubs and exclusive retreats of Los Angeles as it was inside the Times Mirror Building....With his chiseled good looks, cleft chin, and Stanford polish, Norman also rose naturally to a leadership among the newest generations of L.A. Brahmins. As the older patricians with whom Harry once did business began dying off, a new wave of young tycoons came to populate the exclusive mahogany-paneled grandeur\\" of the city's most exclusive cultural and social organizations. The young \\"brahmins\\" also called themselves &quot;the Economic Roundtable\\" and founded their own organization bearing that name.<br />It was into such a culture that Otis was born and within which he was raised to assume, eventually, his own position of immense wealth, power, status, and prestige. He and others in his generation \\"behaved in much the same fashion as their East Coast counterparts with their insulated neighborhoods, leisure time activities (e.g. membership at the Los Angeles Country Club with its \\"no-Jews/Negroes/Mexicans allowed clubhouse\\"), and social inbreeding. Otis was perhaps the most privileged of sons but, interestingly enough, his father required him to begin at the lowest level in each of the newspaper's departments; after completing one apprenticeship, he was assigned to a different department and again began at the bottom, including salary level. By the time he became publisher, Otis was well-prepared in terms of understanding literally every facet of the newspaper's operations.<br />There are only a few recently published biographies and cultural histories which read like a well-written novel. This is one of them. I'm not suggesting that McDougal is an heir to Balzac or Barzun but I do commend him on the liveliness of his narrative as well as on the substantial content produced by his extensive research. McDougal helps his reader to understand why the Chandlers and the Los Angeles Times have been central to the evolution of a city, indeed of an entire region.ution of a city, indeed of an entire region.	2001-07-17

First with his brothers and then on his own, he created a public persona wearing a \\"hard clown mask\\", a persona which he then became in his private life. Eventually and literally, on-screen and off, what people saw is what they got. Kanfer examines Marx's relentlessly unpleasant relationships with his mother and with his brothers, his inadequacies as a husband and father, his immaturity in \\"matters of women, money, and power\\", the impact of Irving Thalberg at MGM on the Marx Brothers movies made at that studio, and the agonies Marx experienced during his later years. Many (most?) of his most painful wounds were self-inflicted but, as Kanfer suggests, Marx also did great damage to family members. How ironic that someone capable of making so many people howl with delight would be \\"incapable of expressing strong emotion, no matter how deep.\\" That is a realm within  Marx which even Kanfer was unable to penetrate.	2001-07-17
1919119:US	51147790	R342OZIWEG0BC5	0891061533	545185121	Breakthrough Creativity: Achieving Top Performance Using the Eight Creative Talents	Books	5	16	19	N	N	Creative Destruction of Barriers to Creativity	What is important to understand at the outset is that Levesque skillfully combines in this book some of the most important ideas developed by Carl Jung in correlation with concepts developed by Katherine Briggs and Isabel Myers for what is now known as \\"The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®)\\" personality inventory.  According to Levesque, \\"The more you learn about this instrument and Jung's theory behind it, the more you'll see its applicability to an understanding of creativity.\\" There are so many excellent books on the (sometimes elusive) subject of creativity and this is one of the best. Levesque asserts (and I agree) that almost anyone can think much more creatively. That is to say, almost anyone can develop the skills by which to activate and then nourish certain talents which Levesque rigorously examines in this book, one which is intended \\"to bridge the gap between your knowledge of yourself as creative and those workplace demands and expectations to produce new and different results. [This book] will help you to travel from the land of confusion to a continent of clarification and the security of knowing how you are creative and what you must do if you are to produce even more creative results.<br />The basis of the book is the belief that [italics] everyone is creative. Everyone is not alike in his or her creativity because [italics] there is no one best way to be creative. You may not have developed your creativity to the same degree as others, but it's there. Everyone has the potential to be creative at work.\\" Levesque defines creativity as [in italics] \\"the ability to consistently produce different and valuable results.\\" She devotes a chapter to each of eight dominant personality types: Adventurer, Navigator, Explorer, Visionary, Pilot, Inventor, Harmonizer, and Poet. In Part 3, \\"Managing Yourself and Others to Enhance Creativity\\", she shifts her attention first to strategies to achieve effective collaboration and then to a \\"personal action plan\\" which her reader must develop inorder to achieve what Maslow characterizes as \\"self-actualization.\\"<br />Please allow a brief digression. One of my favorite tactics (gimmicks?) when conducting a brainstorming/problem-solving session with  executives was inspired by one of DeBono's books, Six Thinking Hats. I ask participants to wear a Dr. Seuss hat of one of various colors, each of which symbolizes a specific personality with appropriate values. (For example, those who wear a black  hat must \\"remain in character\\" by being cynical, skeptical, negative, etc. and attack others' comments and suggestions. Every 10-15 minutes, participants exchange hats and must assume a new \\"personality\\" appropriate to the color of hat worn. You get the idea.<br />A similar session could be conducted with each participant designated as being one of the eight \\"creative talents\\" discussed by Levesque. Even those who insist they are not -- and can never be -- creative will soon realize the value of taking a hard look at a given subject from variety of different perspectives. They may not generate any dazzling new ideas but, as Levesque insists correctly, they CAN broaden and deepen their awareness of what is possible.<br />Many advocate thinking \\"outside the box.\\" According to Levesque, creativity is not just &quot;thinking&quot; out of the box.  It's feeling, doing, and being out of the box. She asserts not only that almost anyone can THINK much more creatively but also that anyone can BE much more creative, wherever that may be. One of the most important components of &quot;breakthrough creativity&quot; is the realization that creativity is not just a &quot;thinking&quot; phenomenon.  It can also be manifested in being a nurturing team leader, connecting differently with associates, strengthening relationships with clients, etc.  Levesque's identification and exploration of this component sets her apart from DeBono, Von Oech, and others whose work I also admire.<br />Briefly, I want to comment on the word \\"breakthrough\\" and state that I share Levesque's high regard for Adams's Conceptual Blockbusting. What Levesque correctly points out is that there are certain barriers (or \\"blocks\\") which anyone must break through (or \\"bust\\") inorder to think more creatively. Almost all human limits are self-imposed. The first barrier to break through, therefore, is the belief \\"I'm not creative.\\" (Von Oech has this in mind when, in A Whack on the Side of the Head, he discusses ten \\"locks\\" such as  \\"The Right Answer\\" and \\"That's Not Logical.\\") Barriers, blocks, or locks...whatever you wish to call them...all are self-limiting only to the extent they are permitted to be.<br />Obviously, I think very highly of this book. As noted earlier, Levesque brilliantly integrates several important ideas developed by Carl Jung with concepts developed by Katherine Briggs and Isabel Myers for the \\"The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®)\\" personality inventory but she does not stop there. Recall her definition of creativity as [in italics] \\"the ability to consistently produce different and valuable results.&quot; Brooking, Davenport, Fitz-enz, Goleman, and countless others have expanded and enriched our understanding of \\"human capital.\\" With this book, Levesque makes her own unique and substantial contribution to a collaborative exploration of unfulfilled humanity.mment on the word \\"breakthrough\\" and state that I share Levesque's high regard for Adams's Conceptual Blockbusting.

1921059:US	51147790	R75AIAJLP9H3C	081440569X	613210191	Seven Power Strategies for Building Customer Loyalty	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Both a Destination and a Journey	There are dozens of excellent books which discuss the subject of  \\"customer satisfaction\\" and/or  \\"customer loyalty.\\" This is among the best of them. Many of those who read my reviews already know that, whenever appropriate, I recommend that several books on the same general subject be consulted. One of the greatest challenges now facing companies is to attract, hire, develop, and then keep the workers they need. A comparable challenge involves customers as well as the additional need to recapture those lost. Timm  has much of value to say about that need in Chapter 3 when he discusses Strategy 2: Recover Dissatisfied Customers. (Jill Griffin and her co-authors focus on this same need in Customer WinBack. I also recommend Jac Fitz-enz's recently published The E-Aligned Enterprise in which he offers some excellent strategies re customer recapture.)  As Timm skillfully explains, building customer loyalty means building human relationships and that requires constant and committed effort. He introduces twhat he calls the \\"A-Plus\\" standard, recommending specific strategies and tactics to achieve and maintain it in terms of value (Chapter 5), information (Chapter 6), personality (Chapter 7), and convenience (Chapter 8). He then concentrates on \\"Actualizing the A-Plus Customer Loyalty Strategy\\" in Chapter 9, the final chapter. Along the way, Timm includes a series of ingenious \\"Worksheets\\" for the reader to complete. These serve two important functions: They stress key points and they enable the reader to measure (with reasonable if not precise) accuracy the gap between customers' expectations and customers' perceptions of performance relative to their expectations. (We all know that customer perceptions ARE realities.) Appendix A provides a \\"Sample Generic Consulting Proposal\\" (well-done but probably not of much interest to some readers) and Appendix B provides \\"A Quick Review of the Seven Power Strategies\\" which is also well-done and will be useful to those who wish to review key concepts later.<br />Timm's approach is intentionally practical. His insights and recommendations are obviously based on a wealth of real-world experience. As with any other book in which there is also an abundance of check lists, do's and don's, mini-case studies, assessment mechanisms, self-audits, reminders, etc., it remains for each reader of this book to select, correlate, and then integrate whatever is most appropriate to her or his own needs and interests. With all due respect to Covey, there really isn't anything magical (at least in the secular world) about the number seven. Timm could have just as easily recommended anywhere from five to 25 specific strategies worthy of careful consideration. Those he does suggest are as good as any but will be effective only if they are implemented with sufficient passion, precision, prudence, focus, tenacity, and (yes) patience. Only such sustained effort can activate the \\"power\\" to which this book's title refers.<br />When concluding these brief remarks, I presume to offer one (probably obvious) caveat: At a time when change is the only constant, no matter which specific strategies you select, be prepared to revise or abandon those which prove inadequate. Extensive research reveals that, on average, U.S. companies lose half their customers within five years. Given the assistance available from Timm and other experts, you and your organization can certainly improve on that.review key concepts later.<br />Timm's approach is intentionally practical.

Nonetheless, Messner's achievements are breathtaking (no pun intended) and I thoroughly enjoyed sharing his personal account of what each achievement required. What was his primary motivation? &quot;For my own part, I do not come to Everest or any other mountain because I have an ambition to climb it at any price. [Whenever he deemed necessary, Messner was prudent.] My primary desire is to get to know it, in all its magnitude, its difficulty and harshness. I am determined to forego the summit if I can't reach it by breathing equipment.&quot; I recently saw an IMAX film based on Shackleton's Antarctic expedition. Messner and two other prominent mountaineers appeared in the film, re-tracing a portion of the Shackleton saga. I am among those who find it almost impossible to grasp what people such as Shackleton and Messner somehow accomplished in what were (literally) life and death situations. Hence my appreciation of this book in which Messner discusses the specific details of preparations and then provides an eyewitness account of various ascents while sharing his personal thoughts and feelings about what he correctly characterizes as the &quot;magnitude&quot; of at all. I also learned a great deal about various do's and don'ts. The former never guarantee success but the latter invariably result in failure and perhaps tragedy. I read this book with substantial appreciation and also, I admit, a sense of wonder. Messner's heroism is obvious but also his humanity. He is a man, not a myth, and would be the first to stress that point. I am among countless others who view him as an exceptional man and are deeply grateful for what he has agreed to share with us.	2001-07-13

The authors of this book make a substantial contribution to our understanding of what customer equity is, why it is so important, how it can be created, how and why it should be leveraged, and how it can be increased. I commend them for beginning their book with \\"Customer Management: A Quiz.\\" This requires the reader to test her or his knowledge by answering a series of questions, with answers to those questions provided in the chapters specified. The material is carefully organized within three Parts: A New Marketing System, Customer Strategies, and Managing by Customer Equity. The authors then provide an excellent appendix in which they address \\"Issues in Computing Customer Equity.\\" They agree that you can't manage what you can't measure...or compute.<br />As explained in the Acknowledgments section, this book is the result of a process which began in 1975 when Blattberg \\"became aware of the value of the power and elegance of the concept of lifetime value of a customer.\\" He and associates refined the concept within a business context to optimize the value of their customers through acquisition and retention processes. Years later, after a period of incubation, the concept was refined even more as a result of Blattberg's collaboration with Getz and Thomas, co-authors with him of this book whose basic premise is that \\"the customer is a financial asset that companies and organizations should measure, manage, and maximize just like any other asset.\\" Customer equity management (CEM) is more than just a method for calculating the asset value of customer relationships. \\"It is a total marketing system\\" which requires integrative business strategies \\"that simultaneously manage products [and/or services] and customers throughout the customer life cycle and that reframe brand and product strategies within the context of their effects on customer equity.\\"<br />As the authors explain, their book was written for CEOs and chief strategy officers, CFOs and accounting executives, marketing and sales executives, chief information officers, chief technology officers, human resources executives and knowledge officers as well as for account executives, public relations specialists, alumni officers, political representatives, clinical trial officers, not-for-profit managers, recruiters -- \\"in fact for anyone serving a valuable constituency.\\" To the authors' list I presume to add CEOs of small-to-midsize privately-held companies and consultants who are privileged to serve any of those previously listed. The nature and extent of the book's value will obviously vary from one group to another; indeed, from what anyone within any one of the groups may need now and what she or he may need later. The authors provide what, in effect, is a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system by which to create and maximize customer equity. In process, there are dozens (hundreds?) of value-added benefits to be derived. The list of those for whom the book was written correctly suggests both the scope and depth of the positive impact which such a system can have IF properly designed, launched, and then developed.<br />No brief commentary such as this can do full justice to a book such as this whose content is so substantial and whose analyses are so penetrating. But I would like to discuss, briefly, one of its most valuable features: the ten \\"Tables\\" which are included. They range from \\"Features of the Brand Equity and Customer Equity Approaches\\" (1-1) to \\"Effects of Forces on Customer Equity\\" (10-1). The value of these Tables alone is well worth the cost of the book; you can thus imagine how much their \\"textual equity\\" (couldn't resist) is increased when correlated with the narrative. There are also dozens of check-lists throughout the book which help to summarize as well as emphasize key points.<br />In the final chapter, the authors shift their attention to the future of customer equity and offer this warning: \\"With the pace of change you face today, catching up will not be easy. Or, on a more optimistic note: If you can jump all the way to using customer equity as it will exist in the future, and change the rules of the game for your competitors as a result, you'll be very difficult to catch.&quot; Drucker has asserted that among the greatest challenges to be faced is managing a future which has already occurred. I agree. I also agree that the best way to \\"manage\\" that future is to create it...and do that now. Blattberg, Getz, and Thomas explain HOW with precision and eloquence.

1923519:US	51147790	R1SG4V8ZKYWG0O	0471296597	264046899	Implementing Six Sigma: Smarter Solutions Using Statistical Methods	Books	5	40	44	N	N	Daunting	I first read this book when it was published (1999) and recently re-read it in combination with Managing Six Sigma which Breyfogle co-authored with Cupello and Meadows. At the outset, I should explain that my experience with the design, launch, and implementation of a Six Sigma program is limited. Usually I am retained to assist in non-technical areas such as internal and external communications. However, having read almost all of what Deming wrote as well as several other books about his work, and then having direct association with countless technicians involved in various stages of a Six Sigma program, I feel semi-qualified to discuss both of Breyfogle's books. In fact, he may well have written them for non-technicians such as I. They are VERY well-organized. Also, at no time throughout the reading of either book did my eyes glaze over because of charts, maps, statistics, jargon, etc. So I commend Breyfogle (as well as the co-authors of Managing Six Sigma) for creating about as much access as is reasonably possible to this immensely complicated and (yes) daunting, albeit intriguing subject.<br />In the foreword, Frank Shines, Jr. suggests that Breyfogle's Smarter Six Sigma Solutions (let's call it S4) approach can effectively be applied in areas such as these: organizational strategy and vision, communications and education strategy, corporate culture and history, business economics and project prioritization, organizational and individual skills and competencies, and finally, the pace and degree at which the organization can assimilate change. Paul Tobias (in the Foreword) then suggests that \\"the key to business success is doing the right thing faster and better and more efficiently that your competition.\\" For S4, the focus is always on the practical: \\"What are the right Goals and how do you go about achieving them?\\" Two excellent questions which suggest two others: \\"Are these still the right goals? How do we know?\\" Tobias provides an incomplete but nonetheless impressive list of what this book also provides: explanations of basic techniques such as Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Quality Function Deployment (QFD), and process flowcharting  as well as an abundance of powerful statistical techniques and concepts such as exploratory data analysis (graphical techniques), analysis of variance, and measurement capability analysis (gauge studies). Then in another Foreword, Bill Wiggenhorn briefly reviews the evolution of Six Sigma \\"story\\" from its origin at Motorola, suggesting that Breyfogle's S4 consolidates not only the traditional Six Sigma process measurements and improvement tools, but also many other useful methodologies into one easy to understand text. [As a hand puppet who appeared on \\"The Ed Sullivan Show\\" on television years ago once said, \\"Easy for you...difficult for me.\\"] The sections entitled \\"Smarter Six Sigma Solutions Assessments\\", at the end of many chapters, offer additional insight into the selection of the best approach for a given situation.\\"<br />Then, in a long-awaited Preface by the author, Breyfogle identifies needs which S4 can fulfill and then explains how his book is organized. He claims that this \\"guide\\" has a \\"keep-it-simple\\" (KIS) objective to which a hand puppet may refute. To his credit, Breyfogle goes to great length to explain not only his purposes and objectives but also how and serves and achieves them. Finally the text itself. Here are the five Parts:<br />S4 Deployment Strategy Phase<br />S4 Measurement Phase<br />S4 Analysis Phase<br />S4 Improvement Phase<br />S4 Control Phase<br />Then Breyfogle provides four appendices: Equations for Distribution, Descriptive Information, DOE Supplement, and Reference Tables followed by a List of Symbols, Glossary, and References.<br />I think this book will probably be most helpful to executive-level managers in larger organizations (including non-profits) but I presume to suggest that many (if not most) CEOs of those organizations willhave neither the time nor the inclination to absorb and digest all of its contents. (I could be wrong about that.) They and many of their executive-level managers may find Managing Six Sigma more accessible. In addition, I think most owners/CEOs of small-to-midsize companies can also derive substantial benefit from this book if they share Paul Tobias's opinion (quoted earlier) that the key to success in business is \\"doing the right thing faster and better and more efficiently that your competition.\\" With this book, Breyfogle has created (in effect) for all organizations (regardless of size or nature) an encyclopedia of Six Sigma principles and practices, explained and coordinated within his Smarter Six Sigma Solutions Program®.l have neither the time nor the inclination to absorb and digest all of its contents.

When Young wrote this book, neither he nor anyone else at that time (including decision-makers at Cisco) could have predicted what has since happened and not-happened in the company and in its industry. It was once said of Soviet historians that they could predict the past with absolute accuracy. The comments which follow are based on the book as published, not as it would have been written with the wisdom of hindsight.<br />Young organizes his material within four Parts: The Cisco Myth, Competition at the Speed of Light, Fault Lines, and Into the Void. He explains that his book &quot;is particularly;y concerned with the period from the beginnings of the dot-com frenzy in early 1999 to the industry's winter of discontent at the end of 2000. It is a portrait of an extraordinary company, its charismatic leader, and the world it is creating, discovering, exploiting, and fashioning. But there is also a dark side to the story, a hollowness at the core of this great company that is symptomatic of much of the Internet generation, and an arrogance that afflicts Cisco particularly.&quot; Young makes it very clear that what he presents is his version of the Cisco &quot;story&quot; as of when the book went to press.<br />John Chambers, CEO of Cisco, is one of the focal points. Young quotes Chambers extensively and, I think, does so with circumspection. For example, &quot;Make no mistake about it&quot;, Chambers asserts, &quot;the Internet is nothing short of the second Industrial Revolution. Industry is going to change. You have to make the change or you won't survive. They key is how to do it without your existing business. And one of the toughest challenges is figuring out the new channels. Timing is the key.&quot; This has been one of the key verses of Chambers' mantra for almost a decade.<br />Throughout the book, Young offers his own analysis of the nature and extent of Cisco's response to &quot;the toughest challenges&quot; under Chambers'  leadership. He concludes, &quot;Maybe Coyote Valley is where the future is going to be created. Maybe it will not. But it will happen on Internet time supplied by Cisco. John T. Chambers and Cisco, have created the first great empire of the Information Age by selling pickaxes, Levis, and quicksilver to the early miners. Now they're going to sell them to everyone else too. In the process [if they succeed], they'll fulfill the vision printed on the plastic ID card that each of its wears....'We are going to change the way people work, live, play, and learn.'&quot; Chambers remains wholly committed to that vision. Obviously, the full story has yet to be told but in his book, Young has made a strong effort to understand and then explain both Chambers and his company. He shares several rather strong opinions of his own about Cisco's acquisitions (70 companies in five years), its outsourcing model, and its competitors such as Lucent, Nortel, Juniper, and Redback.<br />His readers must now ask questions such as these: Can and will Cisco regain ground lost during the past 6-8 months? What are the most serious barriers to doing that? Young asserts that Cisco has relied on a &quot;dangerous business model.&quot; To what extent (if any) has that business model been modified in recent months? Even if modified, can and will it prove equal to new as well as on-going challenges which lie ahead?<br />My own opinion is that Cisco will continue to experience problems but that it will regain much of its momentum and cap value, if not to the extent it once possessed. I share Young's concern about what he calls &quot;one glaring hole: succession&quot; but based on what I have recently observed, Cisco has a rather deep executive bench and Chambers, meanwhile, seems much more inclined to develop that talent than he once was. So, what we have with this book is one man's analysis of a CEO and his company, based on extensive research. Will every reader agree with Young's opinions? Of course not. If there is a revised edition, Young may well modify (if not repudiate) several of his own conclusions. For those who read this book, he increases their understanding of a great company within a major industry. He raises some very important questions about both and then offers his own answers. Each reader must then take it from there. Fair enough.based on extensive research. Will every reader agree with Young's opinions? Of course not.

McWilliams (The Idea of Fraternity in America) in which he provided a broad yet probing analysis of how and why Americans have formed and then sustained various kinds of groups. The groups' structure and purposes vary: military, commercial, religious, political, economic, social, athletic, etc. Most groups emerge as a result of what might be viewed as enlightened self-interest. Our nation's motto (&quot;E pluribus unum&quot;) correctly suggests one of the basic principles of Colonial solidarity. McWilliams' concept of &quot;fraternity&quot; is quite similar to Shuman and Twombly's concept of &quot;community&quot; even as the two books written by these authors, obviously, also have a different structure as well as different purposes.<br />In the Preface, Shuman first acknowledges the &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; that if a given business is based on a good idea and that idea is effectively implemented, the business will succeed. Then he rejects it: &quot;In reality, no matter how good a business idea is, no matter how well the idea is implemented, as soon as you open your doors for business [literally or virtually], you will find your business has to change -- not just minor adjustments and small shifts in marketing or product design but radical [italics] change.&quot; Shuman then asserts that what he calls &quot;The Rhythm of Business&quot; (TROB) is the most reliable process by which to develop and grow successful businesses of every size and type, not just today but yesterday and tomorrow. (The Rhythm of Business is the title of Shuman's previous book.) Given this methodology and all of the new technologies, Shuman then shares a &quot;second thought&quot;: the business pattern required for the 21st century &quot;is what I call the Collaborative Community.&quot;<br />In this book, Shuman and Twombly (with David Rottenberg) develop that &quot;second thought&quot; by incorporating -- integrating, actually -- technology with TROB inorder to enable their readers &quot;to stay in touch with us and continue to develop their understanding of how to achieve and maintain success in our new networked world.&quot; What they envision, in essence, is a new &quot;fraternity.&quot; The material in the book is organized within three Parts: The Revolution in Business, The New Reality, and The New Business Pattern, followed by a &quot;References&quot; section for those who wish to extend and enrich their understanding of various issues addressed in this book.<br />For whom will this book have the greatest value? Probably owners/CEOs of small-to-midsized companies; especially those who are perhaps struggling, now, with the always-difficult transition from entrepreneurship to professional management. Decision-makers in larger organizations will also derive substantial benefit from this book, especially if they are primarily responsible for business units or even departments within those organizations. Those who share my high regard of this book are urged to check out Fitz-enz's The E-Aligned Enterprise, Segil's FastAlliances, and O'Dell and Grayson's If Only We Knew What We Know.y with TROB inorder to enable their readers &quot;to stay in touch with us and continue to develop their understanding of how to achieve and maintain success in our new networked world.&quot; What they envision, in essence, is a new &quot;fraternity.&quot; The material in the book is organized within three Parts: The Revolution in Business, The New Reality, and The New Business Pattern, followed by a &quot;References&quot; section for those who wish to extend and enrich their understanding of various issues addressed in this book. <br />For whom will this book have the greatest value?

They succeed brilliantly. The material is presented as follows:<br />Part I:  Background and Context of Evaluation (Defining Evaluation; The Evolution of Evaluation; Evaluating Learning, Performance, and Change Initiatives; and The Politics and Ethics of Evaluation Practice)<br />Part II:  Designing and Implementing the Evaluation (Focusing the Evaluation; Selecting the Evaluation Design; Choosing Data Collection Methods; Observation and Archival Data; Surveys and Questionnaires; Individual and Focus Group Initiatives; Sampling; and Analyzing Evaluation Data)<br />Part III:  Maximizing Evaluation Use (Communicating and Reporting Evaluation Activities and Findings; Planning, Managing, and Budgeting the Evaluation; Evaluating the Evaluation; and Strategies for Implementing Evaluation in Organizations)<br />The authors then provide a comprehensive audit mechanism (with specific directions) in an appendix to the three-phase system: \\"The Readiness for Organizational Learning and Evaluation Instrument (ROLE)\\" developed by Hallie Preskill and Rosalie T. Torres. For those in need ot supplementary resources, a substantial References section is also provided.<br />Here is a brief excerpt: \\"Evaluation can be viewed as a catalyst and opportunity for learning -- learning what works and what doesn't work, learning about ourselves and the organization, and learning how to improve what we do in the workplace. As such, it can provide new understandings and insights into our programs, processes, products, and systems. Furthermore, evaluation can provide us with the confidence with which to make decisions and take actions that ultimately help employees and organizations succeed in meeting their goals.\\" The authors agree with countless others that the future success of organizations will be dependent on their ability to build core competencies within a context of collaboration. They suggest that to develop support for evaluation as a knowledge-creating enterprise, \\"we must create a market for it. If we think about evaluation as a means for learning and attaining knowledge, then it becomes integrated into every organizational effort --from product development to program design to process reengineering to systemic change.\\" They then suggest seven specific strategies when introducing or expanding evaluation practice. Throughout the book, they also include 60 Figures (e.g. \\"Guiding Principles for Evaluators\\") and three Tables (e.g. \\"Typical sections and contents of comprehensive written evaluation reports\\").<br />Who will derive the greatest value from this book? Obviously, decision-makers in organizations in need of  \\"enhancing learning, performance, and change.\\" Presumably that includes all organizations. Also, I highly recommend this book to all  consultants now involved with organizations which have the same need. Presumably that includes all of their clients. Finally,  I think this book will of immediate interest and eventual benefit to anyone who has only recently embarked on a business career. They will soon realize (if they have not realized it already) that the nature and extent of what they learn, how well they perform, and how effectively they initiate or respond to change will determine the nature and extent of their career success.<br />With the possible exception of Peter Drucker, no single source can possibly serve all of the needs of any one organization. For that reason, to those who read this book, I presume to recommend a few others: Fitz-enz's The E-Aligned Enterprise and The ROI of Human Capital, Maister's Practice What You Preach, O'Toole's Leading Change, Senge's The Fifth Discipline and The Dance of Change, Katzenbach's Real Change Leaders, O'Dell and Grayson's If We Only Knew What We Know, andjust about anything written by Warren Bennis.and just about anything written by Warren Bennis.	2001-07-09
1928149:US	51147790	R2E53TA1E3I5MQ	0446525235	287153728	Free Agent Nation: How America's New Independent Workers Are Transforming the Way We Live	Books	5	20	22	N	N	A Significant &quot;Approximation of New Realities&quot;	From my perspective, defining a \\"free agent\\" has less to do with vocational status than a state of mind but, as professional athletes and their advisors will correctly point out, free agency has some significant legal and economic implications which must be accommodated. Years ago, Pink wrote an article for Fast Company magazine which generated so much interest that he decided to explore the subject in much greater depth. This book is the result of that exploration. The subtitle indicates that he explains \\"how America's independent workers are transforming the way we live\\" and presumably the \\"we\\" includes all workers as well as those who employ them and those who depend on what they earn. We must also include officials of various regulatory entities (e.g. Social Security, IRS, EEO) who, directly or indirectly, become involved with independent workers.<br />The implications of the subtitle suggest why this book is so important: \\"How America's New Independent Workers Are Transforming the Way We Live.\\" Pink examines a heretofore neglected segment of the workforce,  explaining who \\"free agents\\" are and what they do; more importantly, the impact they have on the workplace and indeed on our entire culture as their number rapidly increases.  The state of mind I referred to earlier is that which any full-time employee can also achieve and sustain, even within a traditional organizational structure. Indeed, it is no coincidence that the most highly admired companies are also the most profitable companies, often dominant within their competitive marketplaces. One of the key reasons for their appeal and profitability is the nature and extent of free agency which those companies not only encourage but frequently require. Southwest Airlines, Nordstrom's, and Ritz-Carlton are but three of countless examples of organizations within which all employees have significant authority as well as responsibility. Such organizations are literally customer-driven without in any way compromising personal integrity or inhibiting prudent initiative of their employees or (if you prefer, as many others do) their \\"associates.\\"<br />I rate this book so highly because Pink (a) makes a significant contribution to our understanding of how and why the contemporary workplace (broadly defined) is undergoing so many major changes, (2) also makes a significant contribution to our understanding how and why independent workers are \\"transforming the way [all of us] live, and (3) asks questions, addresses issues, and offers suggestions all of which will, I hope, generate rigorous and extensive consideration by others, including those employed full-time.<br />Pink organizes his material within five Parts: Welcome to the Free Agent Nation, The Free Agent Way, How (and Why) Free Agency Works, Free Agent Woes, and finally, The Free Agent Future. He then provides an Appendix: \\"Results of the Free Agent Nation Online Census\\" which I found information but also thought-provoking.  In a well-written Epiloque, Pink observes: \\"Today -- in good times and bad, at the peak of the boom or the trough of the bust -- the dice are loaded in favor of the individual....The demands of life will escalate. But more people from more backgrounds -- whether they're pushed into free agency or whether they leap -- will be able to throw off conformity, escape subservience, and live out their true potential. That may not be perfection but it's certainly progress.\\" Pink then  recalls Alvin Toffler's phrase \\"the first approximation of the new realities.\\" What we have in this book is Pink's \\"first approximation\\" of what he perceives to be \\"the new realities.\\" In this context, I recall Lily Tomlin's suggestion that reality is \\"a collective hunch.\\" Also, Voltaire's suggestion that we \\"cherish those who seek the truth but beware of those who find it.\\" Pink has offered neither the first nor that last \\"approximation\\" but what he has offered is important, indeed significant.ing personal integrity or inhibiting prudent initiative of their employees or (if you prefer, as many others do) their \\"associates.\\"<br />I rate this book so highly because Pink (a) makes a significant contribution to our understanding of how and why the contemporary workplace (broadly defined) is undergoing so many major changes, (2) also makes a significant contribution to our understanding how and why independent workers are \\"transforming the way [all of us] live, and (3) asks questions, addresses issues, and offers suggestions all of which will, I hope, generate rigorous and extensive consideration by others, including those employed full-time. <br />Pink organizes his material within five Parts: Welcome to the Free Agent Nation, The Free Agent Way, How (and Why) Free Agency Works, Free Agent Woes, and finally, The Free Agent Future.

The subtitle suggests that it examines \\"How Innovators, Executives, and Investors Manage High-Tech Risks\\" and indeed the authors of the assembled essays do indeed (collectively) provide that examination. The material is organized within six sections: Between Invention and Innovation, Defining Risks and Rewards, Institutional Differences: Large, Medium-Sized and New Firms, Overcoming Barriers, and finally The Changing Landscape. Lewis M. Branscomb and Philip E. Auerswald co-author the Introduction and then a discussion of each of the section subjects. As co-editors, they also include essays contributed by George C. Hartmann and Mark B. Myers in Part I), Henry Chesbrough and Richard S. Rosenbloom (\\"The Dual-Edged Role of the Business Model in Leveraging Corporate Technology Investments in Part II), James C, McGroddy (\\"Raising Mice in the Elephants' Cage\\" in Part III),  F.M. Scherer and Dietmar Harhoff (\\"Technology Policy for a World of Skew-Distributed Outcomes\\" in Part IV), and finally, Mary L. Good (\\"Will Industry Fund the Science and Technology Base for the Twenty-First Century?\\" in Part V. Branscomb and Auerswald also provide an excellent \\"References\\" section as well as a brief but informative section \\"About the Contributors\\" in which the reader is guided to additional  reference sources.<br />As Branscomb and Auerswald explain in their Preface, this book is the result of a joint Harvard-MIT Project on Managing Technical Risk sponsored by the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) of the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). There were two workshops (on June 22, 1999 and then on September 17, 1999). Subsequently, Branscomb and Auerswald assembled a wealth of material (including the subsequent Report to NIST-ATP, \\"Managing technical Risk: Understanding the Private-Sector Decision Making Process. This book is a six-segment (or six-&quot;chapter&quot;) essay co-authored by them, in combination with the five essays. \\"The chapters, though, are self-contained, so that they can be read sequentially without the contributed essays.\\"<br />Later, in the Introduction, they explain that their objective is \\"to map the very specific boundary that lies between invention (an idea) and innovation (a product)....[in process exploring and developing several themes such as] successful innovations are rare, and the rewards must compensate for the risks; there are many ways to fail: technical risks and market risks are closely related; innovation themes are the key to resolving the tension between the rarity of success innovation and the need for a dependable sequence of innovations; there are serious financial, technological, and institutional gaps in the U.S. system of innovation; the pace of development is accelerating and is changing the innovation system; and government institutions, state and federal, must be seen as part of the fabric of social capital on which the innovation system rests.\\" Obviously, no single essay (or even an extended essay such as that which Branscomb and Auerswald co-authored) can possibly address all or even most of these themes. The achievement of this book is that, to varying degrees, each of the contributors, including Branscomb and Auerswald of course) participates in a group collaboration to formulate the aforementioned \\"map.\\" By the end of this remarkable book, is the map complete? No. Far from it.<br />In their concluding remarks, Branscomb and Auerswald suggest that, in the century now underway, \\"creative destruction will continue to be a public as well as private imperative. Yet we must recognize a serious political obstacle: the strong reluctance of some to having the federal government share private firms' costs for early-stage, research-based innovations. Schumpeter's phrase `creative destruction' carries with it the implication that whenever there are innovation winners, thereare likely to be losers -- losers who may complain to their political representatives if government agencies are seen as the instruments of their destruction, however creative it might be for the economy as a whole.\\" Certain institutional deficiencies (both public and private) must be ameliorated so that the investment of the required energies and resources \\"will ensure continued innovative productivity for at least a century to come.\\" Thanks to Branscomb, Auerswald, and their distinguished associates, public officials and corporate executives now have at least the beginning of a \\"map\\" to guide and inform what must be collaborative initiatives.e are likely to be losers -- losers who may complain to their political representatives if government agencies are seen as the instruments of their destruction, however creative it might be for the economy as a whole.\\" Certain institutional deficiencies (both public and private) must be ameliorated so that the investment of the required energies and resources \\"will ensure continued innovative productivity for at least a century to come.\\" Thanks to Branscomb, Auerswald, and their distinguished associates, public officials and corporate executives now have at least the beginning of a \\"map\\" to guide and inform what must be collaborative initiatives.	2001-07-07

However, this sequel is so thoughtful and well-written that it can certainly be of substantial value to decision-makers in any organization (regardless of size or nature) which is determined to \\"thrive in the new business environment.\\" Research data suggest that only 5% of the workforce understand their company's strategy, that only 25% of managers have incentives linked to strategy, that 60% of organizations don't link budgets to strategy, and 85% of executive teams spend less than one hour per month discussing strategy. These and other research findings help to explain why Kaplan and Norton believe so strongly in the power of the Balanced Scorecard. As they suggest, it provides \\"the central organizing framework for important managerial processes such as individual and team goal setting, compensation, resource allocation, budgeting and planning, and strategic feedback and learning.\\" After rigorous and extensive research of their own, obtained while working closely with several dozen different organizations, Kaplan and Norton observed five common principles of a Strategy-Focused Organization:<br />1. Translate the strategy to operational terms<br />2. Align the organization to the strategy<br />3. Make strategy everyone's job<br />4. Make strategy a continual process<br />5. Mobilize change through executive leadership<br />The first four principles focus on the the Balanced Scorecard tool, framework, and supporting resources; the importance of the fifth principle is self-evident. \\"With a Balanced Scorecard that tells the story of the strategy, we now have a reliable foundation for the design of a management system to create Strategy-Focused Organizations.\\"<br />After two introductory chapters, the material is carefully organized and developed within five Parts, each of which examines in detail one of the aforementioned \\"common principles\\": Translating the Strategy to Operational Terms, Aligning the Organization to Create Synergies, Making Strategy Everyone's Job, Making Strategy a Continual Process, and finally, Mobilizing Change Through Executive Leadership. Kaplan and Norton then provide a \\"Frequently Asked Questions\\" section which some readers may wish to consult first.<br />There are many pitfalls to be avoided when designing, launching, and implementing the program which Kaplan and Norton present. These pitfalls include lack of senior management commitment, too few individuals involved [or including inappropriate individuals at the outset], keeping the scoreboard at the top, too long a development process (when, in fact,  the Balanced Scorecard is a one-time measurement process), treating the Balanced Scorecard as an [isolated] systems project, hiring consultants lacking sufficient experience with a Balanced Scorecard, and introducing the Balanced Scorecard only for compensation. When organizations experience one or more of these pitfalls, their key executives can soon become impatient, confused, frustrated, and ultimately, opposed to Balanced Scorecard initiatives. It is imperative to understand both what the Balanced Scorecard must be (e.g. cohesive and comprehensive) and what it must not be (e.g. fragmented and episodic). Kaplan and Norton correctly note that the journey they propose \\"is not easy or short. It requires commitment and perseverance. It requires teamwork and integration across traditional organizational boundaries and roles. The message must be reinforced often and in many ways.\\" Those who are determined to achieve organization-wide breakthrough performance are fortunate to have Kaplan and Norton as companions every step of the way during what is indeed a perilous \\"journey.\\"inciples\\": Translating the Strategy to Operational Terms, Aligning the Organization to Create Synergies, Making Strategy Everyone's Job, Making Strategy a Continual Process, and finally, Mobilizing Change Through Executive Leadership.

Morgan, Teddy Roosevelt, and the Panama Canal	Books	5	22	25	N	N	Isthmus, Canal, Scandals...and So Much More	The &quot;nation&quot; is of course Panama and this well-written and informative book explains the different roles played by members of an especially interesting group who include Joseph Pulitzer, William Nelson Cromwell, Theodore Roosevelt, J.P. Morgan, Phillipe Bunau-Varilla, Senator John Tyler Morgan, Senator Mark (&quot;Dollar&quot;) Hanna, John Hay, and General Esteban Huertas. Espino traces a chronology of events which extends from 1501 when Christopher Columbus arrives in Panama until December 31, 1999, when the United States surrenders its control over the Panama Canal after ninety-six years. With all due respect to the profoundly important social, political, military, and financial implications of various decisions and consequences which Espino examines, I must say that the narrative often seemed to me to be one of a global or at least hemispheric soap opera. There are heroes and villains galore. Plots and sub-plots. Triumphs and failures. Betrayals. Countless opportunities either seized or forfeited.<br />The book's title correctly suggests Wall Street's central influence (both positive and negative) on efforts to finance, design, build, maintain, and control the Panama Canal. To say &quot;Wall Street&quot; is to refer to human beings with resources sufficient to their ambitions. Specifically, Morgan who was involved with a syndicate to purchase the French Canal Company and fund Panama's independence. Hence the importance of Cromwell who founded a pre-eminent Wall Street Law firm and succeeded in defeating the Nicaraguan canal forces in the U.S. Congress led by Senator Morgan. Hence the importance of Pulitzer who (through his newspaper, the New York World) accused President Roosevelt of aiding and abetting the Wall Street syndicate's advocacy of the Panamanian revolution.<br />American military forces were first stationed in Panama in 1857 and remained there to protect and defend the Isthmus until relinquishing authority on December 31, 1999, following a de-Americanization process initiated by President Carter. The &quot;Zonians&quot; will never forgive him for &quot;depriving&quot; them of their tropical paradise, just as so many British &quot;colonials&quot; never forgave Gandhi for leading India to independence.  As for Panamanians, Epson reminds them (and the reader) of what Secretary Cass said (in 1855): &quot;sovereignty has its duties as well as its rights.&quot; No country (including the United States) should ever be permitted &quot;to close the gates of intercourse on the great highways of the world.&quot;<br />In his concluding remarks, Epson observes: &quot;Today, the canal is no longer the vital waterway it once was. Panama, however, continues to be the coveted territory imbued with the special mission because of its critical position as the crossroad of the Americas. The challenges facing the canal are no longer only the security of the waterway, but a forty-year-old civil war in Columbia; drug trafficking; corruption; money laundering; authoritarian regimes; and poor social conditions throughout Latin America.&quot; In some respects, the soap opera continues. In other and more significant respects, a global pressure point remains.de-Americanization process initiated by President Carter.

Engel offers seven ways \\"to maximize the value of the business you have built.\\" His key point seems to be that, whether or not you plan to \\"exit\\" now or within the next 12-18 months, you still need to maximize and quantify the value of your company. He offers a wealth of information and insights which suggest HOW. For owners of privately-held companies, Engel's book will walk them through the process, defining the exit strategies and approaches to them, and then review their implications for funding, income building, personnel, corporate culture, expansion planning, and other matters encountered along the way. Here are the seven strategies:<br />*  Selling to a strategic buyer<br />*  Selling to a financial buyer<br />*  Going public<br />*  Liquidating your assets (that is, milking your business)<br />*  Enforced liquidation<br />*  Managing for life<br />Engel examines each of these seven strategies (or options) in detail. I am reminded of what Prime Minister Begin said, after formulating the accords with President Sadat at Camp David when asked how their agreement had been reached. \\"We did what all wise men do. We began at the end.\\" Engel expresses a similar thought in the Conclusion: \\"The exit strategy, then, should be the first and last piece of the business puzzle every entrepreneur assembles. It ought to be the first decision entrepreneurs make because it has as much impact on their future as anything else -- and it will be their last decision because eventually they must exit.\\" Why wait? Plan the exit strategy now. Engel explains HOW.	2001-07-06

Frankly, I began to read it with certain reservations and was pleasantly surprised to discover that its substance is sound (albeit modest) and the material is presented with an effective writing style. I would have rated it higher were its scope wider and its depth greater. (Those who share this preference are urged to read Solomon's A Passion for Wisdom.) Diamond reveals her objective in the subtitle: to share \\"lessons for living and other musings.\\" She achieves that objective. This is neither a book for \\"dummies\\" nor an \\"idiot's guide.\\" Rather, it is an examination by Diamond of several key ideas she has selected from the writings of various philosophers. Musings tend to be unstructured and, more often than not, intensely personal. Fair enough. Obviously, other reviewers think very highly of this book. Diamond established a rapport with them that she did not establish with me. This book is what it is. Diamond makes no claim that it is more than that. It is not a book to which I will return but one which I will recall fondly.	2001-07-06

I read this book when it was first published (1996) and recently re-read it. As Kaplan and Norton explain in their Preface, \\"the Balanced Scorecard evolved from an improved measurement system to an improved management system.\\" The distinction is critically important to understanding this book as well as The Strategy-Focused Organization which they later wrote. Senior executives in various companies have used the Balanced Scorecard as the central organizing framework for important managerial processes such as individual and team goal setting, compensation, resource allocation, budgeting and planning, and strategic feedback and learning.  When writing this book, it was the authors' hope that the observations they share would help more executives to launch and implement Balanced Scorecard programs in their organizations.<br />The material is organized within two Parts, preceded by the excellent Preface and then two introductory chapters: \\"Measurement and Management in the Information Age\\" and \\"Why Does Business Need a Balanced Scorecard?\\" Logically, Part One examines measurement of business strategy; Part Two examines management of business strategy. Having read all of the 12 chapters, each concluded with a Summary of key points, readers are then provided with an Appendix: \\"Building a Balanced Scorecard.\\" That process consists of a series of specific \\"tasks\\": (1) selection of the appropriate organizational unit, (2) identification of the SBU/corporate linkages, (3) completion of the first round of interviews during which key executives are briefed on the Balanced Scorecard program, (4) evaluation by the program's \\"architect\\" and other members of design team of feedback from various interviews, (5) conducting a \\"first round\\" workshop for the top management team, (6) conducting meetings during which the \\"architect\\" works with several subgroups, (7) conducting a \\"second round\\" workshop for members of the top management team, their direct subordinates, and an appropriate number of middle managers, (8) formulating the implementation plan, (9) conducting the \\"third round\\" workshop, and finally (10) Finalizing the implementation plan. Kaplan and Norton guide their reader through each stage of the process, suggesting all manner of strategies and tactics for consideration without inhibiting their reader from determining what is most appropriate for her or his own organization.<br />Although decision-makers in larger organizations will derive substantial benefit from this book, it would be a mistake to assume that the Balanced Scorecard would not be appropriate to small-to-midsize organizations. On the contrary, it may be even more valuable to them because they have relatively fewer resources available; therefore, the consequences of a failed strategy have greater (in some instances fatal) impact. The two concepts of  \\"balance\\" and \\"scorecard\\" are critically important. All organizations must formulate and then effectively manage those strategies which enable them to achieve an appropriate balance of various resources while taking full advantage of measurement devices by which to obtain relevant as well as accurate and timely data for their strategies' scoreboard. Kaplan and Norton obviously have all this in mind when suggesting, in the Appendix, \\"core\\" measures for finance (e.g. ROI/EVA), customer relationships (e.g. customer retention), and learning and growth (e.g. employee satisfaction). Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read Kaplan and Norton's sequel to it, The Strategy-Focused Organization. It continues their rigorous excamination of what a Balanced Scoreboard can help all organizations to accomplish with effective management of a correct strategy.number of middle managers, (8) formulating the implementation plan, (9) conducting the \\"third round\\" workshop, and finally (10) Finalizing the implementation plan.

This is one of two books which I have just read which suggest excellent strategies and tactics to meet this challenge. (The other is The Employee Recruitment and Retention Handbook, authored by Diane Arthur.)  But what if an organization now has few -- if -- any peak performers? Obviously, it must develop them. How? In Hidden Value, O'Reilly and Pfeffer explain how great companies achieve extraordinary results with ordinary people.<br />You can also hire peak performers. (They think in terms of investment and ROI rather than of cost. So must you.) In my opinion, an opinion with which Chambers may agree, organizations must be constantly, indeed aggressively involved in recruiting all the time. That is to say, at least decision-makers must be identifying \\"the best and the brightest\\" workers employed elsewhere. Perhaps there is no need for them now. Even so, it is important to know who they are, to establish contact with them, and then stay in touch. Chambers suggests a number of effective strategies and tactics to do so.<br />He organizes his material within three predictable Parts: Finding Peak Performers, Hiring Peak Performers, and Keeping Peak Performers. In this volume, he could have added a fourth Part: Recapturing Peak Performers. (He has already addressed many of the key employee-recapture issues in two previously published works, The Bad Attitude Survival Guide: Essential Tools for Managers and No Fear Management: Rebuilding Trust, Performance and Commitment in the New American Workplace.) What I find especially interesting about Chambers' observations and recommendations is that they are equally relevant to finding, obtaining, keeping, and (yes) recapturing customers. His recommendations are based on essentially the same principles although, obviously, strategies and tactics appropriate to employees will be different from those appropriate to customers. In any event, Chambers seems to have covered all of the proverbial \\"bases\\" such \\"Developing Real-World Needs Assessments\\" (Chapter 2 in Part I), Aligning the Interview and the Needs Assessment (Chapter 7 in Part II), and \\"Creating the Culture of Retention\\" (Chapter 10 in Part II). The final chapter summarizes key points. The material seems to be based on a wealth of real-world experience.<br />As Chambers explains, \\"This book was written to provide you, the frontline manager, with the real-world tools you need to increase your ability to find, hire, and keep peak-performing employees. You will not find a lot of theory or academically driven processes to program your behavior. You will find experience-based skills and strategies to help you find and keep the people who will have a positive impact on your productivity and, frankly, increase your value as a manager.\\" I include this last portion of the explanation because so many other books on this same general subject (many of them first-rate) seem to approach it in terms of organizational best interests. Fair enough. If I understand Chambers correctly, he addresses the enlightened self-interest of the individual manager. In my opinion, that differentiates his book from them. Therein lies its unique value.tomers.

It must instead find the unique value that it alone can deliver to a chosen market. Why and how this is done are the two key questions the book addresses.&quot; The authors focus with rigor and precision on three different &quot;disciplines&quot;: operational excellence, product leadership, and customer intimacy. Obviously, the most successful companies are those which excel in all three disciplines. However, each places primary emphasis on only one. I mention all this by way of suggesting that Crawford and Matthews take a comparable position in their brilliant analysis of the reasons why &quot;great companies never try to be the best at everything.&quot; Hence the appropriateness of their book's title.<br />In the Preface, they note that &quot;across the globe and across all industries, businesses are spending billions of dollars sending poorly aimed -- and in some cases offensive -- messages to their customers and leaving literally billions of dollars on the table each day. Instead of talking to customers in a language they can understand and find meaningful, most businesses are actually demonstrating -- through advertising, marketing, merchandising, product assortment and selection, transactional terms, and service levels -- that they don't respect or even know whom they are doing business with.&quot; In essence, that is the problem to be solved. Crawford and Matthews offer a number of specific strategies and tactics in response to the question &quot;How?&quot;<br />They organize their material within ten chapters: Field Notes from the Commercial Wilderness, The New Model for Consumer Relevancy, Would I Lie to You? (&quot;The Overrated Importance of Lowest Price&quot;), I Can't Get No Satisfaction (&quot;Service with a Smile?&quot;), I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For (&quot;Access, Physical and Psychological&quot;), Why &quot;Good&quot; Is Good Enough (&quot;Issues of Product Bandwidth&quot;), Do You Really Like Me? (&quot;The Experience Factor&quot;), Making Consumer Relevancy Work, Supply-Chain Realities, and finally,m Consumer Relevancy and the Future. The concept of Consumer Relevancy is central to everything Crawford and Matthews share in abundance and with eloquence. The attributes of Consumer Relevancy (i.e. price, service, access, product, and experience) have remained constant for centuries &quot;and are &quot;somehow inherently integral to the way people go about commerce&quot; and indeed, according to the authors, the five attributes &quot;emerge as almost preconditions to commercial relationships.&quot; In the final chapter, they assert that &quot;the real business advantage will fall to to those companies that not only hear [the consumer's voice] but also listen to it and shape their offerings accordingly. And based on what we've found in our work on Consumer Relevancy, that's something much easier said than done.&quot;<br />Crawford and Matthews conducted research which involved more than 5,000 consumers. They were surprised by what that collective &quot;voice&quot; had to say. For example, 64% said that an &quot;honest, consistent&quot; price was more important to them than getting the lowest possible price, 73% rated &quot;respect and courtesy&quot; as the being most important to them in a satisfactory commercial experience, and 69% defined &quot;superior&quot; service as the ability to return products unconditionally...&quot;the acid test&quot; of whether or not a company really stands behind what it sells.<br />Many of the book's most important value-added benefits are derived from the &quot;Self-Diagnostic&quot; exercises (Price, Service, Access, Product, and Experience). Also from the &quot;Formula for Success&quot; summaries of key points developed within rigorous analyses of companies such as Dollar General, Superquinn, Circles, Record Time, Southwest Airlines, Campbell Bewley Group, and Gourmet Garage. And also from various Tables such as 2.1 (&quot;Hierarchy of Interaction&quot; which suggests what customers are really saying about how they want to interact with companies) and 10.2 (&quot;The Transformation of Symbols, Meanings, and Conventional Practices -- from the Industrial to Post Information Ages&quot;). I commend the authors on how well they write as well as how clearly they think. I also commend them for what I consider to be a unique quality of humility. Even with all of the research data at their disposal, they resist the temptation to say (in effect) &quot;this is the consumer's voice which is telling you precisely how to conduct your business.&quot; They effectively challenge certain myths about excellence without replacing them with others.<br />Occasionally I read a book which can serve as the foundation of  a  workshop I can conduct for my corporate clients. Here's how it works. Key executives are required to read a given book such as this one in advance, then gather (preferably offsite) for at least a full day. The book's Table of Contents serves as the agenda. Each participant is required to challenge the book's core assumptions, then to suggest which combination of assertions and suggestions is most appropriate to the company's specific needs. Finally, everyone involved collaborates on an action plan to achieve whichever objectives the group has formulated.<br />I agree with Crawford and Matthews that most decision-makers in so-called &quot;customer-driven&quot; companies suffer from self-inflicted wounds because of their inability and/or unwillingness to eliminate Customer Irrelevancy.

As she explains in the Introduction, she read and later met the author of \\"a lovely little book\\", Halftime. During her conversation with Bob Buford, she observed that she had a difficult time identifying with the transformation process he examines in his book because \\"all the examples were rich guys. Most women aren't millionaires.\\" She suggested that he write a sequel from a woman's perspective. \\"Why don't you write it?\\" To her surprise, she agreed. \\"And a journey of discovery began.\\" In brief, that is the genesis of this book. Pederson made a commitment and thus an inevitably an arduous process began. Based on what she shares in this book, I am certain that her \\"journey of discovery\\" continues and I hope she will write several more books.<br />The material consists of 15 chapters which summarize Pederson's interaction with a number of women who have redefined their dreams in the prime of life. They include some familiar names (Mary Kay Ash, Julia Child, Elizabeth Dole, Linda Ellerbee, and Beverly Sills) but several other, less-familiar names of women no less remarkable. The book's final chapter, \\"Just Do It! They Did It!224 is especially effective both as an affirmation of key points and as a source of inspiration for men as well as for women, regardless of age and current circumstance. Pederson sought answers to questions such as these:<br />* How do you learn to listen to that little voice inside of you?<br />* How do you filter out voices of well-meaning people who say \\"don't\\"?<br />* How can you get away from the busy-ness and much-ness of life to find peace of mind?<br />* If you could add one accomplishment to your life, what would it be?<br />* How would you like to be remembered?<br />* How can you be sure of what you need to do?<br />Excellent questions. The women with whom Pederson interacted provide their own answers, of course, and along the way, Pederson and her reader formulate theirs. The titles of the book's individual chapters suggest (to me, at least) something of a consensus among respondents. For example, There Is Still Time, Take Care of Yourself, Get Good Advice, Build a Circle of Support, and Don't Be Afraid of Failure. (These titles remind of Lily Tomlin who once suggested that reality is a \\"collective hunch.\\" She is not represented in this book, I hasten to add.) Lee Smith is also to be commended on the excellent self-help questions she devised for individual chapters. Pederson is a brilliant editor of material she accumulated. Her own distinctive voice blends so well with others' as she and they (as well as the reader) share the \\"journey of discovery\\" to which I referred earlier.

Northcote Parkinson provides an especially informative Foreword in which he briefly discusses the balance between investment risk and reward, noting that human error is frequently the cause of investment failure. Shifting his attention to this book, Parkinson suggests that Train \\"has usefully analyzed a number of these human errors and we do well to study his conclusions. Some of the worst mistakes have been made by people to whom the nature of their problem was entirely new. They lived at a time when the textbooks of economics had still to be written, at a time when the word `inflation' was applied only to balloons. There are still such people today and they can be identified, very often, as folk who have plunged into industry without any previous background in commerce.\\" Parkinson suggests that there are many different causes of financial disasters, with the worst the result of several causes in combination, such as confusion of purpose, overgenerous investment, and a mistake in timing. To these I would add \\"homework\\" or rigorous due diligence. Train carefully examines 20 of the most famous (infamous?) \\"financial fiascos\\" which range from \\"Mr. Ponzi and His Scheme\\" to \\"The Putrefaction of Juan March.\\" He also includes an excellent analysis of two which have always fascinated me: \\"Xerox Discovers the Computer: The S.D.S. Scandal\\" and \\"The Fine New $6 Million Sydney Opera House.\\"<br />Following the brief but insightful analyses of such `fiascos\\", Train concludes his book with an Afterword which has special relevance to the contemporary business world. After noting that the syndrome that begets inflation and then unavailing price controls seems as old as history (e.g. Hammurabi's code in about 1745 B.C. and Diocletian's in A.D. 301), he poses a thought-provoking question: \\"Do we still treat inflation by controlling prices instead of government expenses and the money supply?\\" After all the millennia, Train suggests, an aphorism attributed to the Swedish chancellor Oxenstierna seems to remain true: \\"The world always wishes to be deceived: let it be deceived.\\" Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Edward Chancellor's Devil Take the Hindmost.Oxenstierna seems to remain true: \\"The world always wishes to be deceived: let it be deceived.\\" Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Edward Chancellor's Devil Take the Hindmost.	2001-06-29

Chowdhury creates a fictional situation in which one executive, fired one morning, unexpectedly has lunch the same day with another executive employed by a different division of the same company. The former (Joe Meter) is understandably self-preoccupied as the latter (Larry Hogan) explains his involvement in Six Sigma initiatives. In effect, the reader is an eavesdropper on their conversation. Meter is the narrator. What Chowdhury provides is a primer. (For those in need of a cohesive and comprehensive explanation of this subject, I highly recommend The Six Sigma Way co-authored by Pande, Neuman, and Cavanagh.) Some reviewers have noted that Chowdbury's book is entertaining and that is true. Other reviewers seem to criticize it for what it isn't and that's not fair. It is what it is: a remarkably lucid, reader-friendly explanation of Six Sigma principles, illustrated (by Hogan's own experiences) in a fictitious but credible corporate context. I think this book would serve as an excellent introduction to The Six Sigma Way but has substantial value on its own merits.<br />Here is a brief excerpt from the final chapter as Meter summarizes what he has learned.<br />\\"As I understand it, the main thrust of Six Sigma is to reduce errors and waste in every kind of business endeavor to please customers and fatten the bottom line....You do that not simply by cranking up quality control, but by taking a step back, defining where the underlying problems are -- within the business, processes, or operation -- and eliminating them....The key to doing all that, of course, is measuring where you are and where you want to go, analyzing the data, improving the situation, and controlling the activity after you fix it to make sure you don't slip.\\"<br />Obviously, this excerpt has been taken out of context but I want to include it to suggest the clarity and brevity of Chowdhury's writing style which is consistent throughout the narrative. Also, I share Meter's comments to suggest that the fundamental principles of Six Sigma were not invented at Motorola, Allied Signal, or GE. They have been with us since cave dwellers began to exchange large rocks for sharp sticks. But we can credit executives at the aforementioned companies for creating a nomenclature for the principles, and, for demonstrating how effective they can be if applied with appropriate passion, precision, and patience. Chowdhury's little book creates wide access to those principles. Those who require depth of analysis must seek it elsewhere.comments to suggest that the fundamental principles of Six Sigma were not invented at Motorola, Allied Signal, or GE.

Lee on Leadership: Executive Lessons in Character, Courage, and Vision	Books	5	9	10	N	N	&quot;In the Company of a Great Gentleman&quot;	Crocker has done a brilliant job of identifying and then analyzing various \\"executive lessons in character, courage, and vision\\" from Lee's career. He organizes his material within 11 chapters which range from \\"Understanding Lee\\" to \\"The Marble Man.\\" One of the most interesting sections in the book is the Appendix in which Crocker discusses Lee's \\"lieutenants\\": Stonewall Jackson, A.P. Hill, Jeb Stuart, and James Longstreet. I also appreciate the \\"Select, Critical Bibliography\\" which suggests other sources for those who wish to increase and extend their understanding not only of Lee but of the much larger historical context within which he lived and, yes, struggled. This is not a biography of Lee. Rather, it offers a sharply focused analysis of a military strategist whose human strengths and weaknesses were revealed throughout the Civil War. Crocker observes that \\"One should never underestimate what the War Between the States cost Robert E. Lee.\\" The book highlights Lee's principles (which were never compromised) while providing numerous examples of the leadership he provided to his troops. For me, amidst everything that can be said of Lee, what impresses me most is his dignity...especially when Lee's personal \\"cost\\" to which Crocker refers was greatest. Throughout most of one of history's bloodiest wars, Lee's principal adversary was Ulysses S. Grant. After the war, Lee became president of Washington College. Consider this especially revealing response by Lee to a professor: \\"Sir, if you ever presume to speak disrespectfully of General Grant in my presence, either you or I will sever his connection with this university.\\" Adversaries, yes, but Grant and Lee had great respect for each other's qualities of character as well as military skills. I leave it to each reader to select from among the various \\"lessons\\" provided those which are most relevant to the reader's own needs and interests. Once having read this book, we are better able to understand Douglas Southall Freeman's comment after he completed his four-volume biography: &quot;I have been fully repaid by being privileged to live, as it were, for more than a decade in the company of a great gentleman.&quot;eeman's comment after he completed his four-volume biography: &quot;I have been fully repaid by being privileged to live, as it were, for more than a decade in the company of a great gentleman.&quot;	2001-06-29

Perhaps you have listened to the audiocassettes. In any event, this book consists of a series of thought-provoking questions posed by Roger Mudd which are answered by five of our nation's most eminent historians: Stephen Ambrose, David McCullough, James McPherson, Richard White, and Gordon Wood. Their respective subjects are:<br />The Colonial Era and Revolution (Wood)<br />The Civil War and Reconstruction (McPherson)<br />Westward Expansion (White)<br />The Industrial Era (McCullough)<br />World War II and Postwar America (Ambrose)<br />Obviously, a reader's specific interests will determine which of the Q&amp;A exchanges are of greatest value. Richard Snow provides an excellent Introduction. His associates at American Heritage are also to be commended for completing background research and then writing profiles of the five historians. Mudd is a skillful interviewer. In book form, inevitably, his style and pace can only be suggested but are in great form when the exchanges are heard or (better yet) seen.<br />Snow is quite correct when observing that the five-part narrative \\"is always kinetic, darting, and oblique; and the narrators have at once too high and too close a regard for their subject to sentimentalize it. Nevertheless, the cumulative message is clear and heartening.\\" For Ambrose, here is the clear and heartening message: \\"this is the best country that ever was. This is the freest and, right now, the most prosperous that has ever been conceived anywhere. And, by God,, somebody had to be doing something right to bring us to this point. I want to celebrate the people who brought us to this point.\\" He does so with passion and eloquence. The perspectives and insights provided by the other historians (whose contributions precede Mudd's exchange with Ambrose) also expand and clarify the context within which our nation's history has evolved from one dynamic era to the next.t.	2001-06-28

It is well-written, carefully organized, and provides a wealth of useful information. The advice is sound, apparently based on extensive real-world experience. I think this is a book which will be most valuable to those who are about to begin or have only recently begun a business career. It covers all of the basics. It is not for &quot;dummies&quot; nor for &quot;idiots&quot;  because, first, they won't understand it and, two, because they will be unable to make effective use of whatever they do understand. I strongly encourage supervisors to purchase copies of this book for all who report to them. Or at least for the fast-trackers. Gatto refers to his book as a &quot;toolbox&quot; and that is accurate. Less-experienced employees with ambitions to become managers should review the Contents and then focus on whichever subject is most immediately relevant. Then cherry-pick and implement those ideas, suggestions, strategies, and tactics  which are most appropriate. To them I also suggest a periodic review of the Contents. This is a time when change is the only constant. People change. Their needs and interests change. Their circumstances change. This book's subtitle suggests that this is a &quot;survival handbook for today's workplace.&quot; For soime, perhaps. For most, certainly, a practical briefing on management basics.

Those who have checked out my reviews of other books which address many of the same issues already know that I have a bias with regard to \\"customer satisfaction\\" and \\"customer loyalty\\", agreeing with Jeffrey Gitomer and others that the former is wholly dependent on each transaction and the latter can end (sometimes permanently) because of a single unsatisfactory transaction. The objective for those who have customers (be they internal or external) is to achieve and then sustain their passion about doing business with you. You want them to become evangelists.<br />Of course, Reichheld fully understands all this. In a brilliant essay which recently appeared in the Harvard Business Review, he shares new research which (again) shows that companies with faithful employees, customers, and investors (i.e. capital sources which include banks) share one key attribute: leaders who stick with six \\"bedrock principles\\": preach what you practice (David Maister has much of value to say about this in his most recently published book, Practice What You Preach), play to win-win, be picky, keep it simple, reward the right results, and finally, listen hard...talk straight. In this book, Reichheld organizes his material within 11 chapters which range from \\"Loyalty and Value\\" to \\"Getting Started: The Path Toward Zero Defections.\\" With meticulous care, he explains how to devise and them implement programs which will help any organization to earn the loyalty of everyone involved in the enterprise. He draws upon a wealth of real-world experience which he and his associates in Bain &amp; Company, a worldwide strategy consulting firm. Reichheld heads up its Loyalty Practice. In his most recently published book, Practice What You Preach, David Maister explains why there must be no discrepancy whatsoever between the \\"talk\\" we talk and the \\"walk\\" we walk. Reichheld agrees, noting that the \\"key\\" to the success of his own organization \\"has been its loyalty to two principles: first, that our primary mission is to create value for our clients, and second, that our most precious asset is the employees dedicated to making productive contributions to client value creation. Whenever we've been perfectly centered on these two principles, our business has prospered.\\" It is no coincidence that the world's most highly admired companies are also the most profitable within their respective industries. I wholly agree with Reichheld that loyalty is critically important as a measure of value creation and as a source of profit but that it is by no means \\"a cure-all or a magic bullet.\\" Loyalty is based on trust and respect. It must be earned, usually over an extended period of time and yet can be lost or compromised at any time with a single betrayal.<br />Here are three brief excerpts:<br />\\"One common barrier to better loyalty and higher productivity is the fact that a lot of business executives, and virtually all accounting departments, treat income and outlays as if they occurred in separate worlds. The truth is, revenues and costs are inextricably linked, and decisions that focus on one or the other -- as opposed to both -- often misfire.\\"<br />\\"Companies cannot succeed or grow unless they can serve their customers with a better value proposition that the competition. Measuring customer and employee loyalty can accurately gauge the weaknesses in a company's value proposition and help to prescribe a cure.\\"<br />\\"While every loyalty leader's strategy is unique, all of them build on the following eight elements: Building a superior customer value proposition, finding the right customers, earning customer loyalty, finding the right employees, earning employee loyalty, gaining cost advantage through superior productivity, finding the right [capital sources], and earning [their] loyalty.\\"<br />Who will derive the greatest value from this book? Decision-makers in any organization (regardless of size or nature) which has been weakened by defections among customers and/or employees. If the primary objectives are value creation and partnership, decision-makers in these organizations must never betray or neglect any of the fundamentals of loyalty-based management: \\"partnership builds incentive; incentive builds value; value builds loyalty; loyalty builds even greater value.\\" It's as simple and (yes) as difficult as that.re) which has been weakened by defections among customers and/or employees.

This is one of two books which I have just read. Both suggest excellent strategies and tactics to meet this challenge. (The other is authored by Harry E. Chambers.) But what if an organization now has few -- if -- any peak performers? Obviously, it must develop them. How? In Hidden Value, O'Reilly and Pfeffer explain how great companies achieve extraordinary results with ordinary people.<br />You can also hire them. In my opinion, one with which Arthur may agree, organizations must be constantly, indeed aggressively involved in recruiting all the time. That is to say, at least decision-makers must be identifying \\"the best and the brightest\\" workers employed elsewhere. Perhaps there is no need for them now. Even so, it is important to know who they are, to establish contact with them, and then stay in touch.  One CEO I know has a simple but very effective strategy. Whenever she encounters someone who makes a highly favorable impression on her, she offers her business card. \\"I know you are very happy where you are now. That's great. And frankly, we do not have a suitable position available at the moment anyway. However, if you ever think about making a change, please give me a call. I'd really like to hear from you.\\" Perhaps 18-24 months later, that person calls her.<br />Arthur organizes her material within 11 chapters, ending each with a summary of key points. She then provides two especially informative appendices: \\"Employee Benefits Glossary\\" and \\"Legal Issues.\\" Her advice on using an outside source (e.g. an executive recruitment firm) to help generate and screen candidates will be most beneficial to larger organizations. However, almost all of the other material will be of substantial assistance to any organization, regardless of its size or nature. All by itself, Chapter 6 is worth the cost of the book. In it, Arthur offers a wealth of suggestions concerning competency-based recruiting and interviewing, correctly stressing the importance of first establishing a solid pre-recruitment foundation, one which takes into account questions such as these which anyone involved in the interview process should be prepared to answer fully:<br />1. Am I thoroughly familiar with the qualities being sought in an applicant?<br />2. Are these qualities both job-related and realistic?<br />3. Can I clearly communicate the duties and responsibilities of this position to applicants?<br />4. Am I prepared to provide additional relevant information about the job and the company to the applicant?<br />In other words, whenever a position becomes available, take full advantage that opportunity (a) to determine whether or not it should be filled and (b) if it must be filled, to identify job-specific competencies (prior to recruitment) and other factors which are necessary for success. In Chapter 7, Arthur includes Exhibit 8-1 which lists and briefly discusses \\"Reasons for High Turnover.\\" For those organizations which have a problem with employee attrition, Arthur suggests a number of probable causes. In fact, I think all of the \\"exhibits\\" are informative, as with chapter summaries helping the reader to focus on key points which can easily be reviewed later. I also highly recommend Exhibit 11-1 in the final chapter which lists and briefly discusses 20 \\"Future Job Projections\\"; Arthur also includes Web sites which offer additional information about each, such as \\"workplace concierge\\" and \\"corporate anthropologist.\\" Good stuff indeed.<br />Arthur's expert guidance can help any organization to formulate or refine a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system by which to recruit and then retain the people it needs.  Obviously, I think highly of her book. However, given the importance of the issues it addresses as well as the serious implications of decisions which must be made, I strongly recommend that several different sources (including hers) be consulted. Amazon.com identifies a number of possibilities; those who review them can assist the selection process.uding hers) be consulted.

Think about it. Over the past several thousand years, how many writers have been well-fed? Relatively few. That's the bad news. The good news is that in the so-called Age of Information, there are more and better opportunities for writers than at any prior time in history. Bowerman's primary objective is correctly indicated in the book's subtitle: He suggests how to achieve financial self-sufficiency as a freelance writer in six months or less. After a well-written Introduction (which we would logically expect from an expert on writing), Bowerman organizes his material within 15 chapters which range from \\"An Enviable Lifestyle\\" to \\"The Home Stretch.\\" He then provides three appendices, any one of which is worth much more than the price of the book. Appendix A consists of sales letters, a sample contract, a sample brochure, and a sample direct mail piece; Appendix B offers various writing samples; Appendix C is \\"For Women Only\\" and includes interviews with \\"At-Home Moms\\" writers.<br />Here in a single volume is about all the information and advice anyone would need who is thinking about or who has already embarked on freelance writing. Many years ago, a professional writer was asked about how he gets started: \\"I sit there and stare at a blank sheet of paper and wait until beads of blood begin to appear on my forehead.\\" Today's writer probably stares at a computer screen. Point One: writing is easy but re-writing is VERY HARD WORK It requires great self-discipline. Point Two: Getting someone to pay for what has been written is also VERY HARD WORK. Self-promotional skills are at least as important as writing/re-writing skills. These are my two points of emphasis with which, presumably, Bowerman agrees. He fully understands the importance of both kinds of skills. His is not a writer's manual, per se. It's greatest value really is derived from his observations, strategies, and tactics with regard to achieving &quot;financial self-sufficiency through freelance writing.&quot; Keep in mind, that may take more than six months.<br />Hemingway once explained that he wrote \\"to get it out.\\" Almost all of the great authors of fiction wrote because they had to and most of them struggled to pay their bills. Few became (and then remained) solvent and even fewer became wealthy. Let's get it straight right now. Do you feel compelled to write? Why? Or would you merely \\"like to write\\"? I have yet to meet anyone (including homeless people) opposed to financial self-sufficiency. Let's all assume that it is desirable. Let's also assume that you feel compelled to write and are willing (preferably determined) to make and then sustain a commitment to rigorous preparation. Finally, let's assume that (with talent as well as compulsion and commitment) you produce work worthy of compensation. Now what? Bowerman thoroughly answers that question.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Strunk and White's Elements of Style, King's On Writing (yes, that King), Zinnser's On Writing, any essays written by E.B. White and George Orwell, and finally, two other sources which may seem inappropriate but aren't: Foster's How to Get Ideas and Reiman's Thinking for a Living.t; Keep in mind, that may take more than six months. <br />Hemingway once explained that he wrote \\"to get it out.\\" Almost all of the great authors of fiction wrote because they had to and most of them struggled to pay their bills.

Moore. I rate this book so highly because it is exceptionally well-organized and well-written, because it examines several offbeat subjects (eg the development of the typewriter and the evolution of the typewriter industry, the development of the incandescent electric light), and because Utterback focuses so intensely -- and so effectively -- on real-world situations in which the \\"dynamics of innovation\\" are manifest. This book is very informative but also great fun to read. (Those who enjoy it as much as I did are urged to read both The History of Invention and The Lever of Riches.) Chapter 4 revisits the the dynamics of the innovation model (Figure 1-1) and then in Chapter 5, Utterback shifts his attention to developments within the plate glass manufacturing industry. In Chapter 6, he examines the innovation differences between assembled and nonassembled products. Subsequent chapters sustain the discussion of \\"the power of innovation in the creation of an industry\\" and then, in Chapter 9, Utterback \\"draws together some of the lessons of earlier chapters and academic research to consider the relationship between the behaviors and strategies of firms with respect to technological innovation and long-term survival.\\" He concludes his book (in Chapter 10) by addressing \\"the perennial management issue of how corporations can renew their technology, products, and processes as a basis for continued competitive vitality.\\" It is obvious to all of us that even the strongest product and business strategy will eventually be overturned by technological change. Ours is an age in which change is the only constant. Therefore, as Utterbach explains so carefully and so eloquently, the challenge is to accept the inevitability of change which results from technological innovation (\\"discontinuities\\") and to sustain a commitment to cope effectively with such change. Only such a commitment \\"will win the day.\\"nuities\\") and to sustain a commitment to cope effectively with such change. Only such a commitment \\"will win the day.\\"	2001-06-22

We should not be surprised by the quality of content selected nor by the quality of editing provided by Cusumano and Markides. As they explain in the introduction, &quot;The chapters in this volume fall into four categories. Part One (two chapters by Ghoshal, Bartlett, and Moran and one by Mintzberg and Lampel) deal primarily with strategy and value creation in the next economy. Part Two (one chapter by Hax and Wilde and one by Eisenhardt) talks about flexibility in a volatile world. Part Three (three chapters, by Pascale, Beinhocker, and Williamson) continues on this theme but focusses on strategy and strategy-making process in times of uncertainty. Finally, Part four (five chapters, by Hamel, Kim, and Mauborgne; Markides, Prahalad and Oosterveld, and von Krogh and Cusumano) concentrates on strategic innovation and strategies for growth, particularly bin fast-paced markets.&quot;<br />Those (such as I) who subscribe to the MIT Sloan Management Review have perhaps already read many of these essays. How convenient to have a single volume in which they are gathered; also, to have such a well-written Introduction by the editors and then a section (&quot;The Authors&quot;) which suggests additional resources to explore. (I consider Markides' All the Right Moves: A Guide to Crafting Breakthrough Strategy to be one of the most important business books written within recent years.) Some owners/CEOs of smaller companies incorrectly believe that strategic thinking (at least as they understand it) is not of major importance when, in fact, the opposite is true. Go back and examine the origins of what have since become the world's largest corporations and you will learn that each began with one or two basic strategies. For example, when James Cash Penney opened his first store (named &quot;The Golden Rule&quot;) in 1902 in Kemmerer (WY), his basic strategies were (a) to treat each customer as a guest and (b) to offer merchandise of the highest possible quality for the lowest possible price. More recently, in 1983, Michael Dell began to re-sell RAM chips and disk drives for IBM PCs (from his dormitory room at the University of Texas) and by April of 1984, his computer component business was grossing about $80,000 a month. His basic strategy then and now: To sell a limited selection of products directly to consumers and then provide superior service. My point, obviously, is that this book can be an invaluable resource for senior-level executives in large companies but can also be every bit as valuable to decision-makers in small-to-mid size companies.<br />The authors raise almost all of the most important questions to be asked about strategy and then, together, offer thoughtful (at times highly innovative) as well as practical responses to those questions. For example: How to define a company as a value creator rather than a value appropriator? How can a new management framework address the current business environment of complexity and uncertainty by expanding the spectrum of strategic positions? How can successful business strategy emerge from a decision-making process in which executives develop &quot;collective intuition&quot; and accelerate &quot;constructive combat&quot; while maintaining decision pacing and avoiding politics?

Frankly, I had the same reservations before I read this book as I did when about to read Steven Silbiger's The Ten-Day MBA. The titles seem ludicrous. In fact, both Silbiger and Sobel fully understand the obvious differences between reading a book and earning an MBA degree. They have the same objective: In a single volume, to provide as much information and instruction as possible to those unwilling and/or unable to enroll in an MBA program, even if accepted. The subtitle of Sobel's book correctly indicates that he offers \\"the key concepts and techniques in a fraction of the time.\\" (So does Silbiger.) About 15 years ago, Sobel created what he called \\"MBA in a Nutshell\\" and it was very well-received. What we have here is an extension and expansion of that.<br />According to Sobel in \\"Orientation to the Program\\", this book delivers three major benefits that few MBA programs offer: &quot;The emphasis in this book is on practical and utilitarian applications rather than on abstruse matter that a student may learn in order to pass an exam and soon forget, since it has little or no meaning in everyday life....The chapter on education and career pathing (not an academic subject in the MBA curriculum) will serve as a guide to help you ascertain whether you really need the MBA degree or whether other degreed or nondegreed alternatives would be viable for your purposes....[and finally] there is a hidden \\"psychological agenda\\" which provides a \\"grounding in key concepts, techniques, and the terminology or jargon used by MBAs\\" as well as a \\"sense of greatly increased confidence in your own new capabilities and enhanced ability to thrive in the business world.\\"<br />The material is organized within nine chapters: Marketing and Product Management, Accounting and Finance, Human Resources and Operations Management, Statistics, Economics, Technology Management, Business Policy and Ethics, Strategy Planning, and finally, Education and Career Pathing. Sobel then adds an Epilogue: \\"Reflection, Retrospection, and Enlightenment.\\" I have a few quibbles with Sobel. Perhaps he thinks the \\"Orientation\\" is sufficient. I don't. I also question the sequence of the material other than placing Education and Career Pathing last.  However, on balance, I think this is a well-written book, offering solid content. The full responsibility for deriving various benefits rests with each reader. Henry Ford once said \\"Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.\\" The same is true of those who purchase this book.<br />Forget about a 12-hour or 12-year timeframe. First, read the entire book from cover-to-cover at least twice. Then re-read it using a highlighter pen. (I prefer a Sanford \\"Pocket Access\\" with optic yellow ink.) In the \\"Orientation\\", Sobel offers six excellent \\"ground rules\\" to follow while reading and studying. Point is, effective study is hard work. VERY hard work. Most of those who purchase this book and then begin to absorb and digest its contents probably lack the structure of a formal classroom and the guidance provided by an onsite instructor. They also have lots of distractions. Unless you are both willing and able to give to this course of study the attention it requires, and then sustain that commitment over an extended period of time, forget about it.<br />Which book to buy, Silbiger's or Sobel's? My answer is both. Why? Years ago while at work on a Ph.D. in comparative literature, I took graduate-level courses from three professors who were at that time considered to be among the most eminent scholars of the Italian Renaissance. They covered much of the same material but each brought to the given subject entirely different perspectives, issues, questions, biases, etc. Each offered exceptional intellectual stimulation but also what I characterize as \\"intellectual nourishment.\\" Obvioiusly, you will not have (nor could you have) the same experience while reading one or both books. However, there are substantial benefits to be derivedfrom each...and a value-added benefit from reading both (in whatever order) as you correlate their respective analyses of essentially the same topics and issues. Reiteration: Be willing and able to sustain a rigorous commitment to your course of study, at whatever personal sacrifice, or don't bother.ved from each...and a value-added benefit from reading both (in whatever order) as you correlate their respective analyses of essentially the same topics and issues.

It is the first of what I presume will be a series of volumes. (At least I hope there will be others, given the high quality of this one.) The core material is a fraction of what Carl von Clausewitz wrote prior to his death in 1830. His works were published posthumously in 1832. He did not complete his masterpiece, On War, before he died. What we have here is a condensation but not a dilution of his key ideas about strategies and tactics within a military context. Remarkably, these same ideas are also directly relevant to any other context within which effective strategic thinking is needed.<br />Following a brilliant Introduction by the authors (although technically, editors and commentators), the reader is provided with a Preface to the aforementioned Posthumous Edition written by Clausewitz's widow: Marie von Clausewitz, born Countess Bruhl, First Lady in Waiting to Her Royal Highness, Princess Wilhelm. I was fascinated to learn from Frau Clausewitz that her late husband \\"arranged his papers, sealed them in individual packages, gave each one a label, and bid a sad farewell to this activity he held so dear. [A military transfer required Clausewitz to set his writing aside.]...The packages that his hand had sealed were not opened until after his death. It is those posthumous works that are now published in the following volumes, just exactly as they were found, without a word added or deleted.\\"<br />Following Frau Clausewitz's Preface, the authors arrange the material within five sections: The Genius of Strategy, The Theater of Strategy, Thinking Strategy, The Virtues of Strategy, and Beyond Strategy. Brief but insightful comments are provided to introduce each section. As indicated previously, the basic text is a condensation of those ideas most relevant to the given subject. Here are a few brief excerpts<br />When discussing The Genius of Strategy, Clausewitz observes that war is \\"a wondrous trinity when considered as a whole and in relation to its predominant tendencies, composed of the inherent violence of its fundamental nature, the hatred and enmity that must be considered as a blind natural instinct; of the interplay of probability and chance in war that give the mind room to act freely; and of the subordinate nature of a political instrument, making it subject to pure reason.\\"<br />Clausewitz on Thinking Strategy: \\"Strategy is the use of the engagement to achieve the objectives of the war; therefore, it must give an aim to the whole military action that corresponds to the goal of war. Strategy, then, determines the plans for individual campaigns, and orders the engagements within them.\\"<br />Clausewitz on The Virtues of Strategy: \\"Moral forces are among the most important topics of war. They are the spirit that permeates the entire aspect of war; they adhere more quickly and more readily to the will,, which sets into motion and guides the entire panoply of forces. At the same time, they merge at one with the will, because the will is itself a moral force. Unfortunately, they are not the sort of thing that can be codified in books, because they resist being grouped by number or class. They prefer to be seen or felt.\\"<br />What the authors (i.e. editors and commentators) of this book have done is quite masterful. First, they devised strategies of their own to organize the material and then to select appropriate portions from more than one thousand pages of Clausewitz's writings. Next, they created an Introduction to that material, followed by a truly interesting Preface by Frau Clausewitz. Then they created brief comments to introduce each section. Finally, they selected what they call \\"Sources for Sidebars\\" to assist the reader's further study. I also commend them for resisting what must have been a strong temptation to formulate groups of \\"lessons\\" or \\"key points\\" to conclude chapters. Theyalso resisted the temptation to add a \\"Summary\\" section in which they suggest what they view as the most important correlations between Clausewitz's ideas and the 21st century business world. The reader is thus responsible for drawing such correlations. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read Sun Tzu's The Art of War, Machiavelli's The Prince, Crainer's The Management Century, and Strategic Thinking for the Next Economy which is edited by Cusumano and Markides.y also resisted the temptation to add a \\"Summary\\" section in which they suggest what they view as the most important correlations between Clausewitz's ideas and the 21st century business world.

(The use of \\"The\\" in the subtitle is somewhat misleading.) Having read it, I consider this to be among the most enjoyable as well as most informative books about business I have read in recent years. Referring to a collaboration with David Grubin to produce a CNBC documentary, Means explains that \\"we followed the money to the personalities -- both definitive and representative -- that have dominated the last thousand years of business, and to some of the most defining and colorful events of the millennium.\\" The personalities are Sir Godric, Cosimo de' Medici, Philip II, those involved with \\"Tulipmania\\", James Watt and Matthew Boulton, those involved with the Transcontinental Railway, J. Pierpont Morgan, John D.. Rockefeller, Henry Ford, Robert Woodruff, the key players involved in the merger which created Time Warner, and Bill Gates. Here are brief comments by Means on a few of the individuals and situations which are the focus of his attention throughout this book:<br />\\"Born at a time when capital accumulation for the peasantry was nearly unthinkable, [Godric] was nonetheless a model of modern wealth creation: an up-from-the-bootstraps capitalist who transformed the hand fate had dealt him.\\"<br />\\"Cosimo helped to create a world that revolved not around God but around a society with man at the center. After five hundred years, power was shifting from the men of the Church to the men of business.\\"<br />\\"Gifted with unprecedented mineral wealth, [Philip} had set out to reverse the flow of history rather than look forward and embrace growth, and history has judged him accordingly.\\"<br />\\"James Watt is known to us as the father of the Industrial Revolution, and indeed the steam engine he brought to such perfection is the [italics] defining invention of the movement....He needed a partner [Boulton] to transform his genius into a product and to bring the product to a market where fortunes were waiting to be made....The steam engine [developed by Watt and promoted by Boulton] that would power the first locomotive would radically alter transportation across England and throughout Europe. Across the ocean, it would even pull a continent together. But its invention and manufacture would be left to other minds and hands.\\"<br />\\"Throughout the last millennium, it was control that created fortunes: control over the oceans or railroads, the highways or the airwaves. At the start of the new millennium, it's still control -- this time over cyberspace, the new wealth machine. Some things never change but here's the difference: This road to riches is open to everyone.\\"<br />I include these brief excerpts to suggest both the style and thrust of Means's presentation of material. As Grubin correctly points out in the Foreword, \\"Scientists and politicians, artists and scholars, all contributed to the millennium of change, but the world's businessmen -- its bankers and industrialists, merchants and entrepreneurs -- were a powerful driving force behind the stunning transformation.\\" Means is to be commended for so skillfully guiding his reader through this immensely interesting process.

As Grubin correctly points out in the Foreword, \\"Scientists and politicians, artists and scholars, all contributed to the millennium of change, but the world's businessmen -- its bankers and industrialists, merchants and entrepreneurs -- were a powerful driving force behind the stunning transformation.\\" Means is to be commended for so skillfully guiding his reader through this immensely interesting process. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Mokyr's The Lever of Riches.	2001-06-14

I am among those who saw Martin play for the New York Yankees and I later followed his career as a Major League manager of several different teams, including one in Texas where I now live. He always fascinated me. DeMarco draws certain appropriate comparisons between Martin and George S. Patton. Indeed, many of the same qualities which explain Martin's success in the dugout and Patton's success on the battlefield help to explain why both had so many problems elsewhere.<br />Consider first Martin's and then Matt Keogh's explanation of &quot;Billyball&quot;: &quot;Just give me a little room, I'm going to take advantage of it. What the hell. When you're a leader, you have to lead. That's when you stick your neck out. Leaders ar not followers. They are innovators. They are gamblers. They're not afraid to take a chance, not afraid to fail....Billyball is nothing more than just aggressive, old-fashioned baseball where you're not afraid to make a mistake...forcing the opposition to make mental and physical mistakes. Going against the grain. Going after them all the time...Force the other team to execute perfectly...Always looking for an opportunity out there to create something. But get it quick. Right now. Not two innings from now.&quot;  Now consider what what one of his former players, Matt Keough, has to say: &quot;A definition of Billyball would be: What we did equaled making them worry. Talk about spitters and all that. stuff -- the whole thing was to create anxiety. And when you create anxiety, you beat 'em. That's all it was. He generated a tremendous amount of anxiety, because no one wanted to look stupid.&quot;<br />Especially the younger members of  teams which played &quot;Billyball&quot; under Martin's leadership usually performed above their talent levels. They developed a swagger, a brawler's mentality, and a hatred of losing. Meanwhile, the values and principles which drove Martin the player and manager suggest why he was fired eight times and divorced three times as well as why he initiated so many heated arguments which often resulted in a fight with an individual or a brawl involving both teams. According to DeMarco, Martin &quot;was a great leader, but like General George Patton and General Douglas MacArthur, he was not a great employee.&quot; Indeed, Martin eventually (and inevitably) shredded every welcome mat which greeted him when he first assumed the manager's position with a series of teams which include the Minnesota Twins, the Detroit Tigers, the Texas Rangers, the New York Rangers, the Oakland Athletics, and finally once again the New York Yankees whose owner George Steinbrenner hired and fired him five different times. Martin seems to have been most effective when entrusted with relatively inexperienced and less-talented players, players more inclined to be deferential to him, although a few of his World Champion Yankee teams are among the best during the last 30 years.<br />As indicated previously, the bulk of the material in this book is provided by 33 people who either played with or for Martin or were in some other way closely associated with him. All duly acknowledge Martin's flaws -- and some speak frankly about having been personally abused by Martin -- while suggesting (to a degree of agreement which surprised me) that Martin was also an uncommonly sensitive, thoughtful, loyal, generous, and (believe it or not) spiritual, if not precisely religious person. They knew him well, both in and out of the dugout; I knew of him only from a great distance and was almost wholly dependent upon how he was portrayed by the media.<br />Near the end of his book, DeMarco includes some insightful comments by Paul Stoltz, author of The Adversity Quotient: &quot;So many entrepreneurs and leaders have some of Billy's  profile -- a nontraditional path, childhood adversity, being made fun of or ridiculed, and an uncompromising track record of relentlessness. This is the high AQ [Adversity Quotient) Climber profile. These people can really irritate....Thank God!  Without them, this world would be far less interesting and rich. It is It is the Climbers who shape whatever game they are in. Once the wounds are healed and the hurt feelings mend, we remember the Climbers most fondly and admiringly for the impact they have had and legacy they left.&quot; The 33 provide &quot;untold tales&quot; and DeMarco suggests several &quot;leadership lessons.&quot; Read the book and then take your own measure of Alfred Manuel Martin.childhood adversity, being made fun of or ridiculed, and an uncompromising track record of relentlessness.

The authors are to be commended for their own communication skills, of course, but also for their obvious sensitivity while responding to a common (albeit neglected) problem.<br />They organize their material within 18 chapters, each devoted to situations in which all of us have found ourselves at one time or another. For example, \\"acknowledging special people with love and thanks\\", \\"letting others in on what you remember about special people and times\\", \\"anticipating what others might need now or in the future&quot;, &quot;sharing uncomfortable truths\\", and \\"helping people cope with sadness and loss.\\" The authors fully appreciate the importance of verbal communication and most of us are much better at that than at expressing ourselves in writing. Their book offers assistance to those in need of assistance with the basic elements of a personal message. One chapter is devoted to \\"Messages That Grow Over Time\\" such as journaling, adding more to a family tree, and making oral histories; another is devoted to &quot;wonderful messages that didn't fit anywhere else in the book but are just too good to leave out\\"; and still another is devoted to outstanding &quot;message-making suggestions others have shared with us.&quot; After reading the book, I was unable to think of one important personal situation which has been overlooked by the authors.<br />There are at least two different ways in which to read this book: cover-to-cover or go directly to a chapter which discusses a situation of special relevance to you now. Both are valid but I recommend the first approach because the flow of information (especially the examples provided) has an accumulative and valuable impact which selective reading precludes. This is not a textbook on writing nor a \\"how to\\" manual. Rather, it is an anthology of &quot;powerful, personal messages&quot; from the authors to their reader. Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book? Anyone who is eager but reluctant to send her or his own &quot;powerful, personal messages.&quot; I think this would be an excellent gift from grandparents and parents to younger people who also have their own strong personal thoughts and feelings but may lack the assistance they need to express them effectively in writing.<br />I conclude with what some may view as an unorthodox suggestion to parents of school-age children in (let's say) grades 5-12: present this book as a gift to their English teachers, some of whom can then devise appropriate exercises to supplement those which improve students' grammar and punctuation or their understanding of why Hamlet hesitates to kill Claudius.

To me, his intellectual curiosity and reasoning skills resemble those of a highly-skilled anthropologist who has studied hundreds of cultures throughout the world inorder to understand why some are healthy and others are not. The results of his research are obviously of interest and value to professional service firms but also, in my opinion, of greater importance to organizations which are not (as literally defined) professional service firms. I presume to assert, moreover, that precisely the same values and principles which Maister affirms are those which characterize any healthy community. Specifically, one in which trust, respect, and integrity are cherished; in which there is an appropriate combination of fun and discipline; in which there is an uncompromising determination to achieve excellence; and one in which the development of each person is a shared commitment.<br /><br />In this book, Maister shares the results of his study of 139 offices of 29 firms in 15 countries in 15 different lines of business. To the approximately 6,500 people who participated in this study, he asked \\"a simple question\\": Are employees' attitudes correlated with financial success? The answer is an unequivocal \\"Yes!\\" Maister already knows that the world's most highly admired companies (e.g. those at which competitors' employees seek employment) are also the most profitable and have the greatest cap value in their respective industries. \\"What is even more powerful, as the book shows, it is [employee] attitudes that drive financial results, and not (predominantly) the other way around. Why do so many people want to work for Southwest Airlines? The airlines' most frequent fliers know the answer: employee attitudes. It is no coincidence that Southwest Airlines has consistently out-performed all other airlines, financially and operationally, for more than 20 years.<br /><br />Maister offers what he characterizes as \\"new evidence to support important, but perhaps familiar, conclusions. (Hence the significance of the book's title: the message is not to preach new things, but to practice what most managers and firms already preach.)...The summary is deferred until the latter portion of the book.\\" As is his style, Maister urges his reader to be alert to \\"lessons\\" he (Maister) may have missed or failed to stress. He also urges the reader to judge for herself or himself which \\"lessons\\" are most important. For me, the most valuable material is found in Chapter 7 when Maister explains what he calls \\"The Predictive Package.\\" He identifies and discusses nine key statements such as \\"Client satisfaction is a top priority in our firm.\\" He suggests that affirmations of these nine statements \\"represent a great place to get started\\" and that is true IF everyone involved fully understands what the implications of each \\"key statement\\" are, especially insofar as each member of the organization is concerned.<br /><br />In the last chapter, Maister observes: \\"People must believe that the manager has the courage to believe in something and, more importantly, the guts to stick with it. There is no greater condemnation of a manager than to say that he or she is expedient, and no greater commendation than to say that he or she truly lives and acts in accordance with what he or she preaches.\\" I am reminded of the fact that Dante reserved the last and worst ring in Hell for those who, in a moral crisis, preserved their neutrality.  The manager Maister describes so well in Chapter 20 is also a leader....a moral leader, with or without title or social station...whose values and behavior nourish the lives of others. Although Maister's most recent study has finite evidence to support his affirmations, we need only reflect on our own abundance of experience to appreciate those affirmations and, more tothe point, to then live our lives accordingly.live our lives accordingly.	2001-06-12

Here is another of the \\"leadership lessons from\\" volumes which seem to be published in an ever-increasing number.  I was curious to know what Kaltman had to say about one of our nation's most successful generals who is also generally viewed as one of our least successful Presidents. The bulk of the book focuses on Grant the general but Kaltman adds a brief section in which he attempts to place Grant the President within an appropriate historical context. The material is organized within 11 chapters, ranging from \\"Seize Opportunities: April 1822-August 1848\\" to \\"Always Do What's Right: February-December 1865.\\" Kaltman then provides a Conclusion (\\"The Quintessential Grant\\") and an Addendum (The aforereferened \\"Grant's Mismanaged Presidency\\"). The net result is much more than a portrait of Grant. Indeed, Kaltman has carefully examined all manner of primary sources from which he has selected what he considers to be those \\"leadership lessons\\" which are most relevant to our own time. (I wish he had included a Bibliography.) At the heart of this book is an essential paradox: the same leadership principles and strategies which enabled Grant the general to achieve great success are precisely the same which (for various reasons which Kaltman suggests) Grant rejected or failed to use while serving for two terms as President.  I am among those who consider Grant's Personal Memoirs a literary masterpiece as well as one of the most valuable historical accounts of the American Civil War. Therefore I was not in any way surprised by the eloquence of Grant's remarks which Kaltman generously and skillfully includes together with appropriate comments by others best-qualified to comment on Grant, both in terms of his military leadership and qualities of personal character.<br />With regard to the title of this book, Kaltman shares three quotations from those who had direct association with Grant. One observer noted that Grant \\"smokes almost constantly\\" and the most famous is of remarks by President Abraham Lincoln concerning Grant's fondness for whiskey (\\"...if it made fighting generals like Grant I should like to get some of it for distribution\\"). However, the remarks which I found most revealing were made by Robert E. Lee to a professor at Washington College where Lee served as president after the Civil War: \\"Sir, if you ever presume to speak disrespectfully of General Grant in my presence, either you or I will sever his connection with this university.\\" I urge those who share my high regard for Kaltman's book to read or re-read Grant's Personal Memoirs.by President Abraham Lincoln concerning Grant's fondness for whiskey (\\"...if it made fighting generals like Grant I should like to get some of it for distribution\\").

In fact, Lowe and others have already written or edited an abundance of material about Welch. Moreover, judged as a biography or as a critical analysis, the book is solid but (for various reasons) nowhere near as lively as recent biographies of DiMaggio, Daley, Orwell, Chandler, Chaucer, and Greenspan. Perhaps it is Lowe's writing style. Perhaps it is her often deferential attitude toward Welch as icon. Perhaps it is the relatively modest amount of information about Welch as an imperfect (albeit extraordinary) human being. Frankly, I had hoped to obtain previously unavailable information about various transitions in his life as well as in his career. Or at least learn more about what his career transitions reveal about his values. And especially more about his reflections on past mistakes as well as successes. I plan to wait a month or two and then re-read this book. Perhaps I will then agree that it is the \\"fascinating and rewarding book\\" which George Kozmetsky claims, as quoted on the dust jacket. For now, I rate it OK.	2001-06-11

This is not a book from which everyone will derive substantial benefit because many (most?) people who read it will probably not be willing to sustain the necessary commitment to the \\"equation\\" Ziegler shares. (I am reminded of the aphorism \\"The harder I work, the luckier I get.\\") If you are among those who believe that there are certain \\"secrets\\", \\"keys\\", \\"short-cuts\\", etc. to achieving quantifiable goals of wealth and success in life, and can thereby achieve the freedom permitted by a great lifestyle and peace of mind, you need to re-think your values. However, if you are sincerely (indeed passionately) determined to improve both the quality of your life and of your lifestyle, this could well be the one of the most important books you will ever read. According to Ziegler, all successful people have four common characteristics: Attitude, Desire, Work Ethic, and Competency. These are the \\"cornerstone pillars\\" of Ziegler's Prosperity Equation. On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the highest possible rating, how do you measure yourself in terms of each of the four? Now consider what Ziegler refers to as \\"peripherals\\": gather people, define your vision, leverage other people's experience, see change as a challenge, make quick and accurate decisions, have a lasting and meaningful relationship, saturate your mind with success, know God, have honor, invest your money back into the business, see each person as an individual, embrace technology, and manage multiple projects. Once again, rate yourself on a scale of 1-10. If you gave yourself (on average) a nine for each of the \\"cornerstone pillars\\" and \\"peripherals\\", you either do not need this book or are in an advanced stage of denial.<br />But if your average rating is in the 4-7 range, Ziegler has much of value to share with you. First, he shares his thoughts about attitude (\\"Get Your Mind Right!\\"); next, he reviews relevant experiences (both good and bad) in his life (\\"My Story\\"); then he suggests how his reader can apply in her or his own life an appropriate combination of strategies and tactics (\\"Getting Ready to Get Ready\\"); and finally, Ziegler addresses the reader's need to promote himself or herself effectively (\\"Advertising and Marketing and Sales...Oh My!\\") and then provides a Bibliography of suggested readings for additional study. My strong suggestion is that, after completing Part One, the reader take what Ziegler calls \\"a naked look\\" and conduct, in effect, a self-audit in terms of the \\"cornerstone pillars\\" and \\"peripherals.\\" Then read the remaining three Parts. Next, formulate a list of specific personal and professional goals as well as a detailed Action Plan to achieve them.

Robertson examines the evolution of language, the accumulation and evaluation of information enabled by language, modes of communication by which to share that information, and new technologies which create almost unlimited opportunities to communicate with almost anyone, anywhere, and at any time.

The author of each essay is a distinguished historian who is especially well-qualified to comment on the given subject.  James M. McPherson serves as general editor and provides an Introduction which, by itself, is worth the price of the book. He also provides the analysis of Abraham Lincoln. David Rubel assists McPherson in the capacity of editor.<br /><br />Each of us has a special interest in certain Presidents and therefore is inclined to proceed to those essays which discuss them. Fair enough. What I found of special interest and value is the information and analysis provided concerning Presidents in which I had little (if any) prior interest, such as Van Buren, both Harrisons, Polk, Fillmore, and Buchanan. The essays are supplemented by a wealth of illustrations as well as what I view as \\"historical nuggets.\\"<br /><br />For example, during the administration of John Adams, we learn that on August 28, 1797, \\"In order to end costly pirate attacks on American merchant shipping in the Mediterranean Sea, the United States signs a treaty with the Barbary Coast state of Tunis. The agreement, ratified by the Senate in January 1800, requires the United States to pay tribute to Tunis.\\" These brief but informative items supplement each essay.<br /><br />The reader is also provided with detailed information about various Presidential campaigns as well as the inaugural addresses of winning candidates, from George Washington (April 30, 789) until Bill Clinton (January 20, 1997). If a higher rating were available, I would give it to this unique volume.	2001-06-04

All are first-rate and well-worth checking out. In this book, Joel Kurtzman edits a series of in-depth interviews of 12 of the most influential thought leaders during the last decade. Obviously, some will quibble with the number and/or with specific selections. However, although several may be unfamiliar to you, after you read the interviews I think you will agree with me that all 12 are eminently worthy. They are: Charles Handy, Minoru Makihara, Keshub Mahindra, C.K. Prahalad, John Kao, Paul M. Romer, Stan Shih, Norbert Walter, John T. Chambers, Warren Bennis, Gary Hamel, and Jean-Rene Fourtou. In the Foreword, Brian N. Dickie (president and COO, Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton) suggests that \\"the new agenda\\" for CEOs and their top[ teams (managing for growth, business process redesign for the next generation, and new organization structures) and then suggests that \\"the winners will be those CEOs who can integrate the new agenda with their own clear vision while simplifying the execution challenge and inspiring their organizations to perform beyond expectations.\\" It is from this perspective that Kurtzman then provides the 12 interviews. None of them fully addresses all of the issues but together, the CEOs provide insights of substantial value to decision-makers at all levels of organizational configuration. Here are three brief excerpts, obviously taken out of context but nonetheless thought-provoking:<br />\\"With people scattered around the world, you really have to let them be on their own. The assignments are often difficult and you need them for specific purposes. Those purposes may change. That means you have to run the organization on the basis of professionalism and trust -- and subsidiarity.\\" Charles Handy, Professor, London Business School, and author of The Age of Unreason and The Age of Paradox<br />\\"The management of creativity is more intimate [than the traditional management skill set that is appropriate to a large, complex industrial-era organization]. By that I mean that it deals with an individual's personal, psychological landscape. It deals with the way you create relationships. It deals with creating an atmosphere and environment that support the creative process. As a result, it is a management skill set that is inherently psychological and that encourages desired outcomes rather than demands those outcomes.\\" John Kao, Harvard Business School, and author of Jamming<br />\\"What we have to do is work out a balance between tolerating some monopolies and monopoly profits -- since that's how we motivate people to discover new recipes -- with competition to keep prices low and distribute products widely. We encourage this competition by granting property rights that are partial or incomplete. In practice, what this means is that while in the physical economy with diminishing returns there are perfect prices, in the knowledge economy with its increasing returns there are no perfect prices.\\" Paul M. Romer, Stanford Business School<br />Kurtzman has exceptional skills as both interviewer and editor, framing initial questions and then adjusting smoothly during the rigorous but informal exchange of responses. He guides each \\"thought leader\\" without imposing any of his own opinions. The result is that the reader is provided with direct access to how each of the 12 thinks as well as what each has to share about a given issue. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out the other volumes in the \\"Strategy &amp; Business\\" series from Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton. I also highly recommend Strategy + Business magazine of which Kurtzman served as editor-in-chief.[than the traditional management skill set that is appropriate to a large, complex industrial-era organization].

Thoreau was a man of great intellectual courage while possessing at the same time an uncommon sensitivity to the natural world in which he seemed to be most comfortable. Within the context of American society during the mid-19th century, it is interesting to observe his development of concepts such as civil disobedience which later had such a profound influence on the thinking of public leaders such as Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. I have always admired the rigor of Thoreau&#8217;s intellect which is evident in abundance throughout his published works. While proceeding through this single volume in which most of his essays and his poems are arranged in sequence, I developed a much greater appreciation of (for lack of a better term) his &#8220;humanity.&#8221; Those who desire a wider and deeper context for consideration of these works are urged to read Walter Harding's The Days of Henry Thoreau as well as Robert D.

Updated Edition	Books	5	12	12	N	N	So Near and Yet So Far...Even Today	The authors ask, \\"Can women reach the top of America's largest corporations?\\" They can and they have...but rarely. This book examines the results of a three-year study of women executives in \\"Fortune 100\\" companies. First published in 1987 and then in a revised edition in 1992, Breaking the Glass Ceiling is not wholly current with the situation in these same companies today. (Question: How many have lost their lofty rating they have under-utilized the capabilities of their female employees? Hmmm....)  From my perspective, however, most of the book's assertions and conclusions are still valid. The so-called \\"glass ceiling\\" has been raised since 1992 but it is still there. Although no long legal, it remains a major barrier nonetheless.<br />Think about it: You can see where you want to go...you know what you must do to get there...and you are confident of your abilities. So your upward journey within the organization begins. Just as Dorothy saw the distant glow of Oz, you see just as clearly your own destination. It excites you, it inspires you, and you begin to think about how wonderful it will be to get there. As you carefully ascend, you encounter what seems to be a pane of glass. Your face is flush against it. You can still see your destination above you, so near and yet so far. You have hit the \\"glass ceiling.\\" Now what?<br />The authors organize their material within eight chapters whose titles correctly indicate the sequence of their analysis:<br />The Ceiling and the Wall: The Double Barrier to the Top<br />Up or Out: How Women Succeed, How They Derail<br />Perception Is Reality: The Narrow Band of Acceptable Behavior<br />Lessons for Success I : It's Not Enough to Work Hard<br />Lessons for Success II: It's Not Enough to Work Smart<br />Breaking the Glass Ceiling: Making It to General Management<br />Hitting the Wall: Facing Limits, Finding Alternatives<br />The Future: Can Women Make It to the Top?<br />Where Are They Now?  According to the authors, they  are encouraged by two trends: the development of a new \\"business imperative\\" which requires organizations to utilize fully all of its human assets, and, the renewal of \\"legal and legislative pressures.\\" The former is best understood in terms of enlightened self-interest; the second is best understood in terms of the threat of litigation if prevailing laws against gender discrimination have been violated. Whatever it takes.  The authors observe: \\"While there is still a long way to go, progress is being made. Some have broken, or at least cracked the glass ceiling, while others have found ways around it. All have treated the last several years as a learning experience and have applied their own advice in facing the challenges of pioneering women.\\" The \\"business imperative\\" as well as \\"legal and legislative pressures\\" may have done much to eliminate the \\"glass ceiling\\" within organizations. Well and good. But a significant challenge remains: To remove it it, also, from within the minds of those who have been its victims.<br />Breaking the Glass Ceiling (bold face) helps us to measure what has been accomplished since 1987 when it was first published; 14 years later, it reminds us of what remains to be done.are encouraged by two trends: the development of a new \\"business imperative\\" which requires organizations to utilize fully all of its human assets, and, the renewal of \\"legal and legislative pressures.\\" The former is best understood in terms of enlightened self-interest; the second is best understood in terms of the threat of litigation if prevailing laws against gender discrimination have been violated.

Slywotsky explains that Part I of this book describes the basic rules of Value Migration\\" and the workings of what he refers to as \\"the new game of business.\\" As when playing chess, winning at this game requires an understanding of the individual pieces (i.e. when to deploy them and how to capture them). One must master basic moves and simple techniques such as openings, traps to avoid, end-game moves, etc. It is also important to understand the the importance of controlling (as in chess) \\"the four central ones.\\" In business as in chess, one must become familiar with certain \\"basic patterns\\" which will ultimately determine success or failure. These \\"patterns\\" are examined in Part II. There are seven: Multidirectional Migration (from steel to materials), Migration to a Non-Profit Industry (airlines), Blockbuster Migration (pharmaceuticals), Multicategory Migration (coffee), From Integration to Specialization (computing), From Conventional Selling to Low-Cost Distribution, ands finally, From Conventional Selling to High-End Solutions. Slywotsky shifts his attention in Part III to explaining how to play the Value Migration \\"game\\" well on a day-to-day basis. He identifies certain specific initiatives to take which help to (a) avoid value loss and (b) preempt the next cycle of value growth. \\"The final chapter of the book focuses on the increasingly high-stakes nature of the decisions that determine future value growth.\\"<br />There are more than a dozen charts which effectively illustrate Slywotsky's key points. For example, Figure 15-1 presents \\"The Grand Masters of Value Growth\\" and identifies them, their key moves, and the value each created (in terms of billions of dollars) from 1980 until 1994. All of these visionary leaders (Welch, Walton, Vagelos, Gates, Petersen, Grove, Malone, Platt, Noorda, Iverson, and Kelleher) focused on making the right moves and thereby created enormous value for their respective companies. \\"Business chess is a game that is as demanding as [football and basketball], but in very different ways. It is not physical stamina, but stamina of thought. It is not transactional concentration, but constant shuttling between a focus on the current move and imagining the next several moves out. It is an unrelenting exercise of matching patterns on the current game board to the countless patterns in your mind.\\" Slywotsky concludes the final chapter with a suggestion that this question be asked: What five moves will capture most of the given industry's value growth? \\"Give yourself a couple of months to analyze and assimilate the grand masters' key moves. Then come back and determine the five (or fewer) critical moves for your company.\\" In this exceptionally thought-provoking book, Slywotsky indicates why he would be an indispensable guide throughout that difficult but necessary process.that determine future value growth.\\"<br />There are more than a dozen charts which effectively illustrate Slywotsky's key points.

John Rhodehamel selected the contents and created the eloquent as well as informative notes which accompany them. The selections range from Paul Revere's \\"Memorandum on Events of April 18, 1775\\" when the American War of Independence began to James McHenry's letter to Margaret Caldwell (dated December 23, 1783) in which he discusses \\"The revolution just accomplished.\\" Here in a single volume are primary sources (many of them otherwise inaccessible) which are essential to a full understanding of that war, written by those who experienced it firsthand. No brief commentary such as this can possibly do full justice to the quality and diversity of the material. At best, all I can is to give some indication of its scope. Selections include George Washington's address to the Continental Congress when he accepted command in 1773, Peter Oliver's perspective as a Tory on the significance of what happened at Bunker Hill (1775), John Bowater's account to the Earl of on the British evacuation of Boston, Benjamin Franklin's letter to Lord Howe in which Franklin explains why \\"it is impossible we should think of Submission\\" (1776), Jabez Fitch's discussion of American prisoners in New York (1777), John Andre's perspectives on the British retreats to New York and New Jersey (1778), Nathaniel Greene's letter to Alexander Hamilton in which he comments on the plight on forces in South Carolina, and Washington's speech to his officers in which he expresses concern about \\"The flood gates of Civil discord\\" (1783). Obviously, not all readers will be interested in all selections. Hence the importance of Rhodehamel's excellent notes. Wisely, he has also preserved many of the original stylistic devices which enrich the sense of the selections' authenticity. Those who regard this volume as highly as I do are urged to check out David McCullogh's John Adams, Joseph Ellis' Founding Brothers, and John E. Ferling's Setting the World Ablaze.'s Setting the World Ablaze.	2001-06-03

The venture capitalist asked for his business card. \\"On the back of it, please explain why my firm should invest in your idea.\\" Disbelief. \\"I can't possibly get it all down on the back of a business card!\\" Pause. \\"Then I'm sorry but I really don't think we have anything to talk about.\\" Years ago, a journalist asked Katherine Hepburn to explain the success of her career. \\"Elimination.\\" She had eliminated from her life everyone (including a husband with whom she remained close friends) and everything which interfered with her career. These two quite different situations illustrate, I think, the most important point in Bill Jensen's book.<br />He asserts that simplicity is \\"the new competitive advantage in a world of more, better, faster.\\" It is certainly one of them. The book is divided into four sections:<br />The Aha (which includes a discussion of Simplicity's \\"Evil Twin\\")<br />Simpler WorkDays (e.g. using time, planning, contracting),<br />Simpler Companies (e.g. \\"designing work for easy navigation\\")<br />Simpler FutureWork (ie \\"changing how we structure companies\\")<br />Jensen concludes with an Epilogue in which he discusses \\"The Power to Do What's Important.\\" I think this is a carefully-reasoned, thought-provoking, and eloquent book.<br />One important point which some reviewers seem to have ignored is that Simplicity enables us to cope much more effectively with Complexity. Think about all the clutter you haul around in your mind; all the clutter piled up within your workstation and probably on your computer's hard drive; all the clutter your organization staggers and stumbles through each day. In any competitive environment today, change is the only constant. As one result, carefully crafted \\"long-range plans\\" can become irrelevant in a single day. Organizations are comprised of people; people, by nature, love to collect \\"stuff.\\" Lots of it. Many of our accumulations (including business assumptions) no longer have value. Jensen correctly affirms the value of the \\"KISS Principle\\" to how we think. He understands that our values and perspectives generally determine how we behave. Obviously, it would be Stupid to Keep Everything Simple. But surely it makes sense, \\"in a world of infinite choices\\", to use Simplicity as a leadership tool to help us think smarter. I highly recommend this book to those who are determined to do so.re comprised of people; people, by nature, love to collect \\"stuff.\\" Lots of it.

Suffice to say that it has great significance within the evolution of the author's \\"education.\\" As I read Komisar's remarkably candid account of that process, I felt as if we were interacting one-on-one. His is an exceptionally personal account. In the Epilogue, he concludes \\"When all is said and done, the journey is the reward. There is nothing else. Reaching the end is, well, the end.\\" Meanwhile, however, why not extend the journey? Why not delay its conclusion as long as possible? And meanwhile, forge ahead?<br />Komisar shares his thoughts and feelings within a framework that includes \\"Lenny\\" and \\"Allison\\", two would-be entrepreneurs. Serving as both mentor and coach (to the reader as well as to them), Komisar draws upon his extensive experience to explain how both his life and his work have become indistinguishable amidst the unique tensions and pressures, perils and opportunities, highs and lows, of the Silicon Valley culture. For much of the book, Komisar seems to live simultaneously both within and beyond that culture. He challenges \\"Lenny\\" and \\"Allison\\" to examine their personal values as well as their professional goals. In doing so, he also challenges his own...and those of his reader. (Not all \\"cheese\\" exists \\"out there.\\"  Indeed, the most valuable \\"cheese\\" is found internally and it also \\"moves\\" as we reach, stumble, learn, fail, reach and stumble again, achieve some success, etc.) Readers' reactions (including those of reviewers) vary, sometimes significantly, because not everyone is receptive or at least accessible to what Komisar offers.<br />Many of those who have read the book think Komisar's use of Lenny and Allison is effective. Others disagree. In combination with the monk and his riddle, however, Komisar's relationship with Lenny and Allison does create some appropriate opportunities for him to sustain his own process of exploration. After several awkward transitions, he begins to feel a \\"subtle change -- the warm touch of the sun on his shoulder.\\" For Komisar, this is an epiphany. \\"This was my trip, my life, and I needed my own journey. I decided to throw away the itinerary [cribbed from others] and see where this might lead.\\" Some readers are enlightened, perhaps even moved by this development just before the book ends. Others are not. But all will agree with Komisar's concluding remark: \\"No time to waste.\\"feel a \\"subtle change -- the warm touch of the sun on his shoulder.\\" For Komisar, this is an epiphany. \\"This was my trip, my life, and I needed my own journey.

Most organizations have severely limited resources for marketing. Horowitz offers lots of sound ideas, several of them originally introduced in his previous Marketing Without Megabucks. (Even organizations which have \\"megabucks\\" can learn a great deal from Horowitz.) He correctly stresses the importance of (a) identifying precisely who the audience is, (b) getting the right information to them, \\"being heard\\" despite all the \\"noise\\", and (c) motivating them to do business with you. The material is organized within six Parts: Key Concepts, Print Promotion, Electronic Exposure, Incredible Internet, Phone and Face, and The Growth Curve. Marketing professionals may well view this book as \\"simplistic\\" and perhaps in some respects it is. However, few organizations have marketing professionals on staff. Most do the best they can with who and what they have...usually an over-extended owner with a few \\"extra\\" dollars to spend. When buying this book for about $20.00, you retain Horowitz as a consultant to help increase demand for what you sell. Take your time working your way through the book. Highlight key passages. Take notes. Go back and re-read sections which seem to speak directly to your immediate needs. Because the book offers more suggestions than you can possibly use, cherry-pick those which are most appropriate, and, which can be acted upon soon, if not immediately. Most important of all, with Horowitz's help, challenge all of your assumptions about your business. Ask tough questions. For example, why do your customers buy from you? What are customer expectations? Unmet needs that you can fill? Who else buys what you sell but not from you? Why not?  Price? Convenience? Service? (Do you know?) In all contacts with customers, how effective are your and your associates' people skills? Do customers feel appreciated? How about repeat business?<br />There's so much \\"noise\\" in every marketplace and sometimes it's deafening. So many \\"voices\\" competing to be heard. Also lots of \\"clutter\\" which makes it more difficult to see...and to be seen. Horowitz understands all this. Much of his book is devoted to attracting favorable attention. Being noticed. Try lots of stuff. Experiment on a limited basis with several different strategies and tactics. Find out what works...and what doesn't. Also find out why. Ask customers what they think. Also ask family members and neighbors. (Ken Blanchard is right: \\"Feedback is the breakfast food of champions.\\") Horowitz poses almost all of the questions which must be asked. He also offers answers. Some answers are right for your organization...others are not. Know why. Obviously, I think highly of this book as a single-source, as a basic manual, in which Horowitz provides an abundance of practical and cost-effective marketing ideas, carefully explained and generously illustrated. In the final chapter, he sums up his perspective on successful marketing. Then in the \\"Resources\\" section which follows, he provides additional information which may also be of interest.<br />I offer only one caveat: Even if Horowitz were a full-time employee in your organization and devoted all of his attention to your marketing needs, working with a budget of (let's say) $20-million, he would not be successful unless your organization (a) offers quality products and/or services at a fair price, (b) is totally committed to serving the needs of customers, and (c) also takes very good care of its own people. \\"Grassroots marketing\\" principles really don't work very well with weeds.ace and sometimes it's deafening.

(There are four.) The material is carefully organized and developed within nine chapters. The first sets the scene. Chapters Two through Six \\"explicate the major themes associated with women's learning.\\" In Chapter Seven, the focus shifts to several feminist pedagogies. In Chapter Eight, the reader is asked to consider the implications of what has been presented thus far. The final chapter addresses other implications: those for urgently-needed and expanded future research and scholarship on women's learning. Then in a Postscript, the authors (in effect) congratulate women on what they have accomplished thus far and then challenge them to believe in their ability to achieve even more.<br />Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book? Certainly those responsible for planning and conducting executive education programs in which women participate. Also, those participants. Finally, those who agree with the authors (as do I) that responsible and rigorous research and scholarship on the education of women has (in Paul Williams' words) \\"only just begun.\\" One of my favorite passages is provided in the Postscript when the authors urge their reader to \\"journey into learning\\" and suggest three companions (\\"sister travelers\\") from Native American folklore: The Old Spider Woman who is the Great Mother (\\"creator, weaver, tender of the fires of life\\"), the Seeker Woman who is a guide for women on a journey into the unknown (providing \\"consciousness and enlightenment, insights and intuition, and unmasking, which reveals inner truth\\"), and the Woman of Knowledge who who serves as a guide for \\"turning things upside down on our learning journeys, for looking and listening and feeling and thinking with different eyes.\\" In fact, anyone (indeed everyone) now preparing to to embark on or already involved in a \\"journey\\" to achieve knowledge and (hopefully) wisdom should have all three as companions.

In this sense, the title is somewhat misleading. Freedman offers what the subtitle suggests is a \\"commonsense framework for managing the client relationship.\\" He organizes his material within three Parts: The Profession of Consulting, The IT Consulting Framework, and Developing Superior Consulting Skills. The consulting profession has undergone all manner of changes in recent years, no doubt the result of many factors which include the increase of outsourcing, the recognition by many organizations of the need for engaging employees as specialists to address specific needs and interests, and also the emergence of what Daniel Pink describes as \\"free agents\\" in his recently published Free Agent Nation. As Freedman explains, his book is based on \\"a few fundamental beliefs\\": \\"informational technology consulting is a profession on a par with engineering and architecture...professional standards must be applied once a consultant has accepted a consulting engagement...advisory skills, which enable us to develop relationships of trust and confidence with out clients, are as important to our success as mastery of technical disciplines...[and finally that] there are proven practices and common sense techniques that help consultants deliver the benefit of information technology in a way that would be impossible without us.\\" He examines with rigor various phases of the IT Consulting Framework. Along the way, he generously shares his own experiences (both good and bad) as he established and developed his own client relationships. His objective is to help his readers to understand proven practices that IT consultants can use to define their role in the engagement, and to understand m[as indeed they must] their clients' technical, organizational, and cultural environments.<br />One of the book's many value-added benefits is the provision of four Appendices: Sample Request for Proposal, Sample Proposal, Sample Communications Plan, and Sample Project Plan. Obviously, these are benchmark templates, each of which must be modified (perhaps significantly) to accommodate the specifics of a given situation. The chapters which precede them help the reader to make such modifications.<br />In the Conclusion, Freedman reaffirms that the book's aim is to prepare consultants, \\"through the use of a structured delivery system, to help clients obtain the results they expect and so have a better shot at generating the customer satisfaction that leads to referrals -- and ultimately to a thriving practice.\\" I hasten to add that many organizations now have internal consultants for whom this book will also be immensely helpful.

I was looking for patterns from which to draw conclusions, patterns derived from what was said and what wasn't.\\" He interviewed 40 prominent CEOs worldwide who include C. Michael Armstrong (AT&amp;T), Michael Bloomberg (Bloomberg L.P.), Richard Branson, (Virgin Management Ltd.), Stephen M. Case (American Online, Inc.), Michael S. Dell (Dell Computer Corporation),  Roger A, Enrico (PepsiCo, Inc.), Andrew S. Grove (Intel Corporation), Rupert Murdoch (The News Corporation Limited), Hiroshi Okuda (Toyota Motor Corporation), Jurgen E. Schrempp (DaimlerChrysler AG), George Soros ((Soros Fund Management LLC.), and John F. Welch, Jr. (General Electric Company). \\"I tried to come to grips with what I thought of the environment CEOs faced, how they were dealing with it, and what more, if anything, they ought to be doing.\\"<br />This is a very revealing statement because it correctly suggests that the mind of Jeffrey E. Garten is as much involved in this book as are the minds of those CEOs he interviewed. Indeed, Garten shares several judgments of his own. For example, Garten asserts that global CEOs are not nearly as powerful as many people now assume as they struggle with three kinds of challenges amidst the third industrial revolution: \\"First, they have their hands full with the central strategic problems of how to take advantage of the Internet and the global economy. Second, they face certain everyday dilemmas of leading and managing corporate Goliaths.. And third, they have roles to play on the world political, economic, and social stage.\\"<br />In the final chapter, Garten suggests that the three challenges \\"will be assessed by historians as having been too difficult for most CEOs to successfully handle all at once.\\" This is especially true in larger organizations as their structures become \\"flatter\\", as delegation of authority becomes both wider and deeper, as \\"virtual\\" operations expand, and as strategic alliances (even with traditional competitors)  proliferate.

Lowe deserves great credit for her editorial skills. Her selections are outstanding and well-organized. For me, this book offers a rare opportunity to share Welch's insights re subjects such as setting proper priorities, allocating resources, anticipating and then preparing for an uncertain future,  responding to unexpected crises, healing self-inflicted wounds, eliminating deadwood, adjusting or abandoning ineffective strategies, and -- meanwhile -- remaining committed to non-negotiable core values. When Welch &quot;speaks&quot;, all of us should listen very carefully. This book probably comes as close as any single source could to maximize the value of such an interaction.	2001-05-23

For someone who has not read any of the authors' (especially Trout's) other books, this has some value. For that reason, I rate it higher than do many other reviewers. However, it is inferior to the original Positioning (by Ries and Trout) and adds very little (if anything) that is &quot;new&quot; to the concepts and comments provided in that important book. The value of the original is increased substantially when read in combination with other works such as Levitt's The Marketing Imagination and Barker's Paradigms. Because effective positioning is (literally) a moving target, those involved must be both willing and able to modify that positioning in response to rapid, sometimes major changes in the competitive marketplace. That is to say, new positioning may be necessary. The authors of this book already have an excellent title. Now all they need is a text which is worthy of it.	2001-05-22

For example, vendors, service providers, and strategic allies. Moreover, it is one of the few books I have read which focuses almost entirely on the marketing and sales of services which are, paradoxically, both \\"invisible\\" and experiential. (Schmitt has much of great value to say about this in Experiential Marketing as do Pine and Gilmore in The Experience Economy and Wolf in The Entertainment Economy.) Beckwick shares an abundance of information and advice, duly acknowledging various sources from which he has obtained some of the material. I do not damn him with faint praise. His own contributions are first-rate.<br /><br />In \\"Summing Up\\", he provides a brief but precise discussion of various sources which he commends to his reader. This has much greater value than does the standard bibliography. And there is a value-added benefit, his sense of humor, which is indicated by some of the section titles such as \\"Anchors, Warts, and American Express\\", \\"Ugly Cats, Boat Shoes, and Overpriced Jewelry: Pricing\\", and \\"Monogram Your Shirts, Not Your Company.\\" Throughout the book, he includes more than 100 of what I characterize as \\"business nuggets\\" which are directly relevant (indeed illuminating) within the context in which he inserts them.<br /><br />For whom will this book be of greatest interest and value? Obviously, those now involved in marketing, sales, and other areas in which there is direct and frequent contact with customers. Beckwick reveals himself to be an astute observer of human nature. What he suggests can be of substantial value to any organization in which business relationships, including those which are internal, are less than desirable. Everything he suggests combines common sense with a sensitivity to others' needs and interests. Indeed, almost everyone in almost any organization (regardless of size or nature) must constantly be \\"selling\\" various services to others within and beyond that organization. First, they must establish credibility, then trust, and finally obtain agreement to cooperate, if not collaborate.  Almost all relationships succeed or fail because of intangibles. Beckwick examines them within a business context but, in process, suggests wide and deep implications relevant to all other areas of human experience.<br /><br />This is an immensely practical as well as thoughtful book.ne in almost any organization (regardless of size or nature) must constantly be \\"selling\\" various services to others within and beyond that organization.

It is truly a &quot;classic&quot; in company with Levitt's The Marketing Imagination and few others. The basic concept is that whatever you and your associates may think of what you sell, how it is perceived by those who are asked to buy is really what determines whether or not it will be purchased. Literally, the marketplace's perceptions (including those of competitors) are the decisive realities. To position a given product or service effectively, therefore, is to have it perceived to be superior to (or at least more desirable than) other purchase options. In an age when almost every product and service has become a commodity, &quot;customer service&quot; and &quot;brand equity&quot; have necessarily been re-defined but the principles affirmed by Ries and Trout remain unchanged. The challenge to marketers now is to differentiate with a more complicated multiple of components which include perceived value (rather than cost), perceived quality, perceived reliability (hence product or service credibility as well as credibility of seller), and perceived ease and convenience of doing business with the seller. There is one other component which should also be included: the pleasure of the purchase experience which Schmitt's explains brilliantly in Experiential Marketing as do Pine and Gilmore in The Experience Economy and Wolf in The Entertainment Economy.<br />When Ries and Trout wrote this book almost a decade ago, the positioning strategies they recommended were in response to a competitive marketplace quite different from the one they and we now survey. Nonetheless, the urgency of effective positioning remains...indeed is even greater today. This is one of the very few books on marketing which should be re-read at least every 3-6 months. (Ditto Levitt's book.) One final point: There is a direct correlation between customer expectations and their perceptions. As the former become higher (sometimes unrealistic), the latter change accordingly. Whatever you offer for sale, make certain that you fully understand customer expectations first before deciding how to manage customer perceptions. Those perceptions are within a frame-of-reference which constantly changes. Positioning is not a location; rather, a strategic imperative.s a direct correlation between customer expectations and their perceptions.

This is one of the best among them. As we all know, the WWW offers faster and better connectivity and interactivity than were previously possible. Hence the importance of portals. Hence (in turn) the importance of the scope and degree of integration which they facilitate. (Those who question the importance of integration are urged to visit Dot-Com Boot Hill and read the epitaphs.) Davydov has extensive prior experience which helps to explain the wealth of information he provides and his practical approach to it. What I find especially interesting about this book is the fact that, as Davydov explains, the strategies which so many &quot;Fortune 100&quot; companies (e.g. Cisco Systems, Dell Computer, GE) use effectively are also appropriate to small-to-midsize organizations. Which book to buy? There are several to select from. Consider this: You can purchase 4-5 of the books for about the same cost as one hour of an author's time if you retained that author as a consultant. Formulate what is (in effect) an RFP which includes precise specifications as to what you seek to accomplish, then compare and contrast (&quot;apples&quot; ONLY with &quot;apples&quot;) the responses of the 4-5 books to those specifications. Cross-reference. Consider using a grid. Whatever. For those organizations now involved or about to become involved in e-business, portals may well be the difference between their success and failure. Your competitors also buy and read books. Put Davydov and others to work immediately.	2001-05-18

(Perhaps there is another group whose members purchase the book and display it prominently but complete no exercises.) In recent years, I have purchased a number of these books and consider this one to be among the best. (Yes, thanks for asking, I completed the exercises but how well I did is not relevant to this review.) For whom do I recommend this specific book? Anyone who is curious to know what the exercises involve, how well she or he does when completing them, and (of greatest interest to me) learning WHY her or his responses are correct or incorrect. Completing exercises in several different books also reveals certain patterns of thought which stimulate the mind to approach a given problem or question from different perspectives. For example, what do the answer choices share in common? What is missing among the options offered? Over time, we develop certain mindsets. For example, we tend to see only what we expect to see. So-called &quot;brain teasers&quot; force us to perceive a given problem or question differently. The brain is a muscle which, like all other muscles, needs regular exercise. Books such as this provide that.	2001-05-18

In this book, he and Devincentis differentiate among three different categories of customer (Intrinsic Value, Extrinsic Value, and Strategic Value), explaining why (and how) the cultivation and solicitation process for each must be &quot;customized&quot; (pun intended) in direct response to their respective needs and interests. The common element (as always) is value. What is it? How can it be verified? How can it be increased? And perhaps one of the most important but least understood questions: So what?<br />What Rackham and Devincentis correctly assert is that when sales are flat, declining or even increasing, it is imperative to &quot;re-think&quot; whatever sales strategies and tactics are now used. (Here's a situation in which the SPIN framework can be especially helpful.), And do so in terms of HOW value is pereceived by each customer. Those perceptions are the most urgent sales realities. It is also important to remember that today's Intrinsic Value Customer may soon be motivated primarily by extrinsic or strategic considerations. The authors offer an intellectual infrastructure within which to ask the most important questions about sales. Although the same questions must continue to be asked, many (most?) answers which are correct today may soon be inadequate, if not flat-out wrong. How well you think and then re-think will determine how well you do.	2001-05-17

According to those with whom he has had extensive personal contact, he is a great human being. Upon first glance, his &quot;Pyramid of Success&quot; seems so simple-minded, so obvious. (At least that was my first reaction when he sent a copy to me many years ago.) Live and learn. Nonetheless, ours is a society in constant search of &quot;secrets&quot; to success. &quot;Keys&quot; to unlock &quot;doors&quot; of opportunity. Short-cuts. &quot;Faster&quot; and &quot;easier&quot; ways to get wherever...to accomplish whatever. In this immensely readable as well as valuable book, Biro skillfully correlates John Wooden's personality and character with his career as a basketball coach and life since retirement. Coach Wooden found neither &quot;secrets&quot; nor &quot;short-cuts&quot; to success at U.C.L.A. On the contrary, his teams began to win a series of national championships only after several mediocre seasons. What is especially noteworthy is that the values on which Coach Wooden's &quot;Pyramid of Success&quot; are based are essentially the same values he had as a school and college player...and the same values by which he was guided when he began to coach high school teams in Indiana. How relevant are these values today? Examine your own life. You'll find the answer there.	2001-05-16

I agree completely with his reasons for praising this book, and, I agree completely with his (and Drucker's) comments about so-called &quot;lifelong relationships.&quot; If you are looking for some rock-solid advice to achieve &quot;breakthrough&quot; relationships with clients, Sheth and Sobel provide it. But as Mitchell and Drucker correctly point out, it is possible but highly unlikely that those relationships can be sustained indefinitely, especially now when change is the only constant and occurs at ever-increasing velocity. Give careful thought to the word &quot;breakthrough&quot; because it has so many relevancies to today's competitive marketplace. When in pursuit of a prospective client, first you have to break through clutter to become visible; then you have to break through other clutter to differentiate yourself from the competition; then overcome other clutter to begin the new relationship; finally, you have to break through still more clutter to sustain that relationship. (Think about juggling handgrenades in a minefield at 2 AM...during an electrical storm...while wearing a blindfold.) Sheth and Sobel offer a wealth of information as well as sound guidance. Much of what they share can also help with the formulation of customer recapture strategies. But take no one and nothing for granted. The &quot;life&quot; of a customer relationship should not be measured in terms of years; rather, in terms of how effectively you nourish that relationship while you have it.	2001-05-16

Athletes are coached to &quot;play within themselves&quot; while striving to set new performance standards. In the business world (as Buckingham and Coffman explain in First, Break All the Rules), the most effective managers are those who focus almost entirely on their people's talents and get those talents in proper alignment with the tasks to be completed. The United States military services (especially the Marine Corps) take an entirely different approrach: Through what is indeed basic training, they require everyone involved to master essentially the same skills, within the same schedule, under the same conditions, etc. Only later are graduates of this rigorous process selected to receive more specialized training, usually according to their talents.<br />This book will be especially valuable to those organizations which have limited resources to invest in formal training. More than 90% of what is learned in any workplace is the result of on-the-job (i.e. informal) training. Collins and Bolger have obviously taken a close look at all manner of formal training programs, including those in the military srevices. They also fully understand the importance of informal training. If your organization has limited resources but a great need to increase the value of its human capital (i.e. increasing the quantity and -- especially -- the quality of what they understand and what they can do), what this book offers would be an excellent starting point. I'm not damning with faint praise. Eventually, if and when appropriate, I would then recommend Peter Senge's The Fifth Discipline and The Dance of Change.<br />All organizations, regardless of size or nature, must constantly focus on increasing the effectiveness of on-the-job training. There are always at least a few people in each corporate department or small-to-midsize company who are both knowledgable and passionate. &quot;They really know their stuff.&quot;  They love to explain what they do and how they do it. Others probably think of them as &quot;born teachers.&quot; Put them to work as trainers and be sure to reward them generously for their services. Provide books such as Collins and Bolger's to assist their preparation. One effective strategy is to have them conduct what I call &quot;brown bag seminars.&quot; Employers or supervisors provide the food and beverages, welcome the participants, wish them well, and then leave the room.

Fair enough. What I most admire in this book is his clarification of what a &quot;winner&quot; is. Long ago, Jack Dempsey said that &quot;champions get up when they can't.&quot; Russell has essentially the same attitude toward &quot;winners&quot; and thereby extends the definition to include people who are not &quot;celebrities&quot; but who demonstrate exceptional courage, decency, and integrity...especially amidst adversity.  They are the appropriate role models for young people. By their example, they reveal themselves to be values-driven leaders. The &quot;rules&quot; Russell affirms are the same rules by which he has defined himself both on and off the basketball court. They are worthy of our consideration.	2001-05-16

On a few (rare) occasions, I observed her when she appeared on television. Obviously very intelligent and articulate. A good person. But somehow guarded. Cautious. Almost shy. I was saddened to learn of her death and then eager to read this, her final book. It reads very much like a journal expanded into separate but related essays in which Greenfield struggles to answer questions such as these: How to understand the culture of the federal government? How to understand the inter-relationships between and among public officials and the media? And finally, in effect, &quot;Where do I fit in?&quot; Greenfield's answer to the first question is that the culture most resembles that of a high school. The inter-relationships can be (depending on a given issue) adversarial, adversarial-cordial, cordial/adversarial, or (occasionally) cordial. Where did Greenfield fit in? To offer an answer to that question could perhaps compromise Greenfield's relationship with her reader. Curiously, much more of what Greenfield thinks is revealed than of what she feels. (Perhaps she would have examined more of her feelings in a diary which, presumably, no one else would ever read.) Her approach to various subjects (e.g. power brokers, &quot;good guys&quot;, villains, national and international crises) seems to be that of an anthropologist. But she also has a journalist's eye for significant details and an ear for the memorable phrase...as well as what could be called a &quot;sniffer&quot; for sensing what may not be immediately evident, lurking behind political posture or rhetoric. Those who knew her well are better-qualified than I am to comment on &quot;who she really was&quot; and &quot;what she was really like.&quot; My remarks are limited almost entirely to this brilliantly written retrospective assessment of a unique culture and an equally unique career. Only after having the read the book could I fully appreciate what Katherine Graham shares in the eloquent Foreword, concluding &quot;I miss Meg and am grateful that she has lengthened her time with us by leaving this book.&quot; Meg Greenfield's own life reveals what her career attempted to understand: &quot;the endlessly engaging complexities and contradictions&quot; of human nature, within and beyond our nation's capital.hat Katherine Graham shares in the eloquent Foreword, concluding &quot;I miss Meg and am grateful that she has lengthened her time with us by leaving this book.&quot; Meg Greenfield's own life reveals what her career attempted to understand: &quot;the endlessly engaging complexities and contradictions&quot; of human nature, within and beyond our nation's capital.	2001-05-16

Wolf, \\"Locally, globally, internationally, we are living in an entertainment economy.\\" In fact, that is the title of his new book which consists of ten chapters which proceed from an introduction to the \\"entertainment zone\\" to a \\"view from tomorrow.\\" In between, Wolf carefully examines a full-range of business situations in which entertainment plays an increasingly more important role. For example, he focuses on the fun-focused customer, the e-factor (\\"there's no business without show business\\"), the battle for attention, the struggle for world domination, the genesis of a phenomenon (ie whatever redefines \\"success\\"), what he calls \\"enteractivity\\", brand empires, and the role of sponsors.<br />Wolf observes that \\"Within its home turf....entertainment is in many parts of the world the fastest-growing sector of the economy. This is as true of developing countries as it is of mature ones. But of even wider impact is the way entertainment content has become a key differentiator in virtually every aspect of the broader consumer economy.\\" Moreover, \\"...where America's entertainment economy goes, the rest of the world is not far behind.\\" Although he does not state it explicitly, Wolf views \\"entertainment\\" from two quite separate perspectives: entertainment as a commodity (films, videos, radio and television, concerts, athletic events, etc.) and entertainment as a strategy (eg to create a sense of being \\"entertained\\"). As Wolf explains, not all commodities are inherently entertaining but it is possible to nourish the appeal of virtually all commodities by use of appropriate entertainment principles.<br />In this respect, Wolf seems to agree with Schmitt &amp; Simonson, co-authors of  Marketing Aesthetics. Consider Williams-Sonoma which attracts customers to its upscale stores with the aromas of fresh-baked bread and fresh-brewed coffee, produced on-site by appliances it sells. Schmitt &amp; Simonson assert that marketing is most effective when it appeals to most (if not all) of the five senses. Wolf would no doubt confirm that the nature and extent of that appeal will usually determine the nature and extent of a consumer's sense of being \\"entertained.\\"<br />Every retail merchandiser should ask, \\"Who buys what we sell? Which images will be most appealing? Window displays, posters, counter-top promotions? Which aromas will be most appealing? Gourmet coffee, popcorn, chestnuts roasting on an open fire? Which sounds will be most appealing? Bach, Hole, Dwight Yoakam, Celine Dion?\\"<br />Wolf characterizes Ted Turner, Michael Eisner, Sumner Redstone, and Rupert Murdoch as \\"the conquistadors of modern business.\\" Why? Because they and their associates understand so well that entertainment (both as a commodity and as an influence) has an almost unlimited global audience. To Wolf's credit, everything he says is directly relevant to almost any organization, regardless of size of nature. If an organization does not understand The Entertainment Economy, it probably doesn't have much of a chance of survival.

I urge those readers to read this and other reviews provided by Amazon.com first before making that decision. The authors focus on the period roughly between 250 and 800, treating it as a \\"distinctive and quite decisive period of history that stands on its own.\\" The material is organized as follows: first a brilliant Introduction which will convince almost any reader of the unique importance of Late Antiquity to human history; then a series of essays by various authors, each followed by an immensely useful bibliography (more about one of those essays later); and then a comprehensive Alphabetical Guide which combines many of the most valuable benefits of an encyclopedia, a dictionary, and a lexicon. The commonly accepted chronological and territorial boundaries of the period -- which encompass Rome, Byzantine, Sassanian, and early Islamic cultures -- are extended by the authors so that \\"new connections\\" can be established and \\"revealing comparisons\\" (and contrasts) are permitted.<br />There are eleven individual essays whose titles suggest the scope of Late Antiquity: Remaking the Past (Averil Cameron), Sacred Landscapes (Beatrice Caseau), Philosophical Tradition and the Self (Henry Chadwick), Religious Communities (Garth Fowden), Barbarians and Ethnicity (Patrick J. Geary), War and Violence (Brent D. Shaw), Empire Building (Christopher Kelly), Christian Triumph and Controversy (Richard Lim), Islam (Hugh Kennedy), The Good Life (Henry Maguire), and Habitat (Yizhar Hirschfeld). I think all are first-rate and especially appreciate what I learned from Kelly's essay. Here is how he begins and then concludes it:<br />\\"On 11 May 330, Rome ceased to be the most important place in the Roman empire. Five hundred miles east of the Eternal City, on a site occupied by modern Istanbul, a new imperial capital was dedicated and (like Rome before it) named after its founder: Constantinople, the city of Emperor Constantine.\\"<br />Following Constantine's death, his son and heir arranged for him to be buried (\\"splendidly and sumptuously adorned with gold\\") in the Church of the Apostles. Amidst twelve shrines, \\"in a glittering catafalque, lay the magnificent sarcophagus of Constantine, the self-proclaimed thirteenth apostle of Christianity -- a new official religion capable, when linked to proper reverence for the classical past, of both justifying and sanctifying a striking shift toward a more autocratic and highly centralized pattern of Roman rule.\\"<br />The quality of thought and expression in these brief excerpts is representative of the entire book. Illustrations (when appropriate) supplement the text. For me, some books based on historical material become \\"magic carpets\\" which transport me back in time to places and people to which I might not otherwise have access. For example, Schama's Rembrandt's Eyes. Other books based on historical material enable me to make all manner of direct connections between  past and current human achievements.

Amidst twelve shrines, \\"in a glittering catafalque, lay the magnificent sarcophagus of Constantine, the self-proclaimed thirteenth apostle of Christianity -- a new official religion capable, when linked to proper reverence for the classical past, of both justifying and sanctifying a striking shift toward a more autocratic and highly centralized pattern of Roman rule.\\"<br />The quality of thought and expression in these brief excerpts is representative of the entire book.

Theirs is literally a WORK book. The material is organized within these seven chapters:<br />Leadership for a Successful Future [\\"Followers, who are often partners in an endeavor, look to leaders to interpret reality, explain the present, and paint a picture of the future.\\"]<br />How to Use This Workbook [\\"We are introducing a different path to leadership development -- one that has twists and turns. It may not take a reader on a direct route to a finite end-place.\\"]<br />The Leadership Crisis [\\"Where have all the leaders gone?...In the past two decades, there has been a high turnover, an appalling mortality -- both occupational and actuarial -- among leaders.\\"]<br />Knowing Yourself [\\"If we have a clear awareness of who we are, we can develop the habit of staying tuned to what we say and do.\\"]<br />NOTE:  Bennis and Goldsmith agree with Shakespeare's Polonius (\\"To thine ownself be true\\") as does James O'Toole who, in The Executive's Compass and in Leading Change, has much of value to say on the subject of congruence of values and behavior.<br />Creating and Communicating a Vision [\\"Vision animates, inspirits, and transforms purpose into action.\\"]<br />Managing Trust Through Integrity [\\"The leader has a vision for the organization that is clear, attractive, and attainable....has unconditional empathy for for those who live in the organization.....the leader's positions are consistent....and the leader's integrity is unquestionable.\\"]<br />Realizing Intention Through Action [Those who would be leaders \\"need to know where you begin and where you want to go....flesh out those routes, elaborate them, revise them, and map them, complete with possible pitfalls and traps as well as rewards\\"....also you must \\"look to see if the direct route is the most sound, or whether you should make a more circuitous approach....you plan your resources and identify your allies....examine your map objectively, as if you were not its maker....Finally, when you have finished the strategy, you set out to climb the mountain.\\"]<br />The authors share a wealth of their own observations and suggestions in each of the seven chapters. What sets this book apart from others which address similar subjects is its inclusion of dozens of exercises for the reader to complete within the (WORK) book. The reader is also provided with \\"Books on Leadership: An Annotated Bibliography\\" prepared by Emmeline de Pillis, Anthony Khoo, and Hyepin Im. To their excellent suggestions I would  add Tichy's The Leadership Engine because, as Goldsmith observes, \\"Our book proposes that in our world of startling changes and overwhelming challenges, leadership is needed at every level and in every nook and corner of our organizations.  We can only have the leadership we need if individuals are encouraged, motivated and supported to create themselves as leaders on a day by day basis.\\" I also recommend Fitz-enz's The ROI of Human Capital because, without effective leadership, no organization can possibly derive greatest benefit from its most valuable asset. Again quoting Goldsmith, \\"The insights, theories, exercises, and tools included within our book guide leadership explorations and discoveries by staff, managers and executives at all levels of their organizations and in all areas of their lives.\\"<br />For whom will this excellent book be most helpful? First, for senior-level executives who are already leaders of others and feel the need for what could perhaps be called a \\"tune-up\\" of basic principles. Also, for those who aspire to be leaders and are willing and able to complete the exercises with both rigor and (more importantly) candor. Finally, for students of business now in preparation forcareers which may soon begin. (This book would be an excellent holiday or graduation gift.) Bennis and Goldsmith conclude as follows: \\"We hope you will continue to develop what you have begun in the learning partnership we have created here together. We look forward to knowing you more directly in the future. Empowerment leads to quality and ultimately to love of ourselves, of our work, and of life. More we cannot wish you.\\" Nor can I.careers which may soon begin. (This book would be an excellent holiday or graduation gift.)

Then, there is another great challenge to develop their talents and skills. Here is one of the best books I have read thus far which addresses the second challenge directly...and indirectly, addresses the first challenge as well (pun intended).  O'Reilly and Pfeffer organize their material within a series of chapters, each of which (presented as a case history) focuses on eight exemplary companies (e.g. Cisco Systems, The Men's Wearhouse, and Southwest Airlines). The authors utilize a basic format (introduction, background, values, philosophy and spirit, etc.) which enables their reader to draw relevant comparisons and contrasts. They also summarize key points at the end of each chapter.<br />After extensive involvement with several of the exemplary companies, I can personally attest that organizations such as they which effectively develop the \\"hidden value\\" in their employees achieve at least three highly desirable (indeed imperative) objectives: they create a workplace environment in which people at all levels are much happier as well as much more productive; as a result, they have less attrition of their \\"best and brightest\\"; and finally, they are much more successful when competing for the \\"human capital\\" they need. To their credit, O'Reilly and Pfeffer do not promise to offer all manner of \\"secrets\\" to simplify the process of attracting and developing talent. Everything they suggest is common sense and much of it is obvious. The \\"hidden value\\" of their book is revealed only as you correlate all the ideas and experiences it provides within the context of your past and current circumstances.<br />If you agree that an organization should be value-driven and that values are driven by people, almost everything O'Reilly and Pfeffer share can be of substantial assistance. But I presume to conclude with three caveats. First, what they recommend is relatively simple to explain but will be immensely difficult (if not impossible) to implement without a firm commitment, sufficient time, and (yes) patience. Second, given the wealth of information provided, beware of massive adoption of what may have been effective elsewhere. Rather, select only what is most appropriate to your organization's needs when formulating a model. Finally, keep in mind that all of the eight exemplary companies have changed, some quite significantly, since the period during which this book was written. So must yours in months and years to come.recommend is relatively simple to explain but will be immensely difficult (if not impossible) to implement without a firm commitment, sufficient time, and (yes) patience.

This is one the very few recently published books which focus almost entirely on recapturing lost customers. For more than 20 years while providing consulting services to a wide range of organizations, I have been frequently asked to help to improve business development. These situations have convinced me that, measured in terms of total cost (hours as well as dollars), the greatest ROI in business development is generated from two sources: former customers and current customers. (My own estimate is that the total cost of adding a new customer is 5-8 times greater than the total cost of keeping a current customer.) Almost none of the organizations with which I have been associated already had a comprehensive plan in place to recapture customers. (Does yours?) Obviously, I think this book will be of greatest value in two separate but related areas: keeping the customers you now have, and, recapturing those whom you've lost. \\"Now is the time to put in place specific strategies and tools for winning back customers, saving customers on the brink of defection, and making your company defective proof.\\"<br />Their material is organized as follows. Part One (Chapters 1-5) examine why customer win-back is critical to an organization's success, how to manage \\"The Big Three\\" (Acquisition, Retention, and Win-Back), specifically, how to win back a lost customer or a customer on the brink of defection, and finally, how to mobilize and manage a \\"Win-Back Team.\\" Then in Part Two (Chapters 6-10), they shift their attention explain why no customer is ever truly safe from defection and what the implications of that fact are, how to build a Customer Information System which drives loyalty, how to target prospects with strong loyalty potential, how to leverage the power of customer-focused teams, and finally, how to build a fiercely loyal staff. The authors then provide excellent appendices. One is \\"The Customer Loyalty Compass: A Proven Process for Finding Customer Value. The other is \\"Estimation of Second Lifetime Value (SLTV) Investment and Profitability.\\" Insofar as the subject of customer recapture is concerned, there seems to be very little that the authors do not cover.<br />Let's say you have read the book and are ready to proceed. Now what? The authors suggest a series of specific steps which are summarized in Figure 10.1 ( \\"Getting Started\\") on page 281 in the hardbound edition which I possess. This section includes five \\"essential loyalty tools\\" which will help to make your organization \\"defection-proof.\\" I hope that this brief commentary has succeeded in indicating what this book offers. Given the fact that your competitors may also read it, I urge you to proceed in a timely manner. Competition for customers (in every industry and market segment) is already ferocious and is certain to become moreso in weeks and months ahead.s \\"Estimation of Second Lifetime Value (SLTV) Investment and Profitability.\\" Insofar as the subject of customer recapture is concerned, there seems to be very little that the authors do not cover. <br />Let's say you have read the book and are ready to proceed.

Very well then, I contradict myself. I am large. I contain multitudes.\\" If each human being is \\"large\\" and \\"contains multitudes\\",  how difficult (if not impossible) it would be to grasp the nature and extent of the diversity within cultures such as families, communities, cities, and countries.  In the Foreword, Rapaille addresses his reader directly: \\"This  book gives you a new set of glasses to look at the way you -- and the rest of the world -- buy and sell, live and function. Just as using the microscope to see microbes changed the way we practice medicine, and breaking the code of the hieroglyphics suddenly gave us access to the incredible amount of information hidden for centuries, archetypology -- the new science of decoding cultures -- is changing the way we look at ourselves, at others, and at organizations.\\" Here are his seven \\"Secrets\\":<br />1. The structure is the message: people don't buy products and services -- they buy relationships.<br />2. Cultures have an unconscious: cultural archetypes have the power to make or break any marketing, sales, or public relations plan.<br />3. Those who don't know the \\"code\\" can't open the \\"door\\": decoding the mindset of the target market opens doors of opportunity.<br />4. Time, space, and energy are the building blocks of all cultures: each culture has a DNA which means that any organization can encode its culture for superior marketing and sales performance.<br />5. Solve the right problem: Each organization must design and create new products or services to solve the right customer problems.<br />6. The more global, the more local: Quality is the passport to global markets, but the code for quality differs from culture to culture, market to market, person to person.<br />7. The Third World War is underway -- and it is cultural: cultural awareness is the key to success and to personal and collective freedom.<br />For whom will this book be most valuable? First, decision-makers in global organizations. Also, others who suspect that certain widely-accepted assumptions about \\"culture\\" (however defined) are either inadequate or flat-out wrong. Of greatest interest to me are those sections in which Rapaille explains how to \\"decode\\" a culture. What he calls &quot;unconscious cultural forces&quot; must be understood or a \\"cultural World War III\\" will be inevitable, if it is not already underway. (He thinks it is.) Those who you have read Daniel Goleman's Working with Emotional Intelligence will be especially interested in what Rapaille has to say about emotional imprints, emotional experiences, and the correlations between and among them. As archetype shifts occur, paradigm shifts seem certain to follow.<br />Throughout the book, Rapaille devotes substantial attention to examining culural realities (and their implications) in terms of their relevance to business in general, and to marketing and sales in particular. At one point he observes: \\"Today's high-speed changes are not as chaotic or as random as we are led to believe. There are not only distinct patterns to be found in culturally specific behaviors and attitudes, but also identifiable forces that shape members of these societies. Once we understand these forces and the way they are organized, we can deal with them strategically.\\"  Perhaps he agrees with Peter Drucker's opinion that man's greatest challenge is to manage a future which has already occurred.  Rapaille's is a significant contribution to our understanding of cultural \\"multitudes\\" even as so many have yet to be revealed.or whom will this book be most valuable?

Those who have already read several of them will find no &#34;new tricks&#34; in this book and may, in fact, share my discomfort with any use of the word &#34;tricks&#34; other than in the quite specific &#34;old dogs&#34; context. The last thing our world needs is having more tricksters in positions of leadership but we do need leaders who inspire in others (in Bennis' words) &#34;a sense of purpose or meaning...a sense of belonging, community, team, or group....[and] a sense of power, involvement, connection, and alliance&#34;<br /><br />In another book, Bennis draws a comparison between managing people and herding cats. Some day, I hope he will write a book (perhaps dedicated to Noah) in which he suggests what can be learned from both the male and female lion as well as from the termite, the orca whale, alligators and crocodiles, the prairie dog, the hyena, etc. For Bennis, the &#34;new trade is all about vision, meaning, purpose, and trust -- and what it takes to maintain these essential elements in modern organizations.&#34; I assume he agrees with me that only a few can occupy the highest executive levels in an organization (CEO, COO, CFO, etc.) but literally everyone in the same organization can be a leader in the sense of taking appropriate (repeat, &#34;appropriate&#34;) initiatives. They will do so, however, only if their organization's leaders &#34;have the capacity to enroll [them]&#34; in a compelling vision. In Section 3, Bennis identifies and then explains several strategies which are needed to achieve that engagement:<br /><br />1. Release the brainpower of people<br />2. Work for the long-term interests of all stakeholders<br />3. Adapt to a new style of leadership<br />4. Form new global alliances<br />NOTE: For small-to-midsize organizations, this probably involves forming strategic alliances with other, much larger organizations which are global in both their nature and scope.<br />5. Reinvent the organization<br />6. Solve problems before they have names<br />7. For everyone involved, be a leader of leaders<br />8. Share the power [i.e. share authority as well as responsibility]<br />9. Make the case for co-leaders<br />10. Create leaders at every level<br /><br />NOTE: Noel Tichy has a great deal of value to say about #10 in The Leadership Engine. I also highly recommend Bennis and Goldsmith's Learning to Lead. If massive organizational transformation is required, I recommend O'Toole's Leading Change and Katzenbach's Real Change Leaders.<br /><br />In his Postscript, Bennis discusses the importance of authenticity. Without it, there can be no mutual trust and respect, nor cooperation (much less what Bennis calls &#34;creative collaboration&#34;), nor any possibility of completing the transition to the New Trade. &#34;Tomorrow's organizations will be federations, networks, clusters, cross-functional teams, temporary systems, ad hoc task forces, lattices, modules, matrices -- almost anything but pyramids.

The components of a new paradigm suggest what these non-negotiable values are: focus on quality, service, and the customer; collaboration and unification; nurturing interdependence; respecting, honoring, and leveraging diversity; continuous learning and constant innovation; [at least for larger organizations] being globally competitive; and finally, having a much broader focus: &#34;My community, my society, my world.&#34; If your own organization lacks these values now, and does nothing to invest itself with them, it has no authenticity...and frankly, no future.zation 6.

Cook (\\"Harvesting S&amp;P Profits\\"), Mark Minervini (\\"Stock Around the Clock\\"), and Claudio Guazzoni (\\"Eliminating the Downside\\"). Revealingly, although the 15 stock traders have significantly different perspectives on investment and (sometimes reluctantly) divulge different strategies, they seem to share certain common beliefs which Schwager characterizes as \\"Wizard Lessons.\\" They include:<br />1.  There is no single \\"truth.\\"<br />2.  Her or his trading style must be appropriate to each trader's personality.<br />3.  Perseverance usually separates \\"winners\\" from \\"losers.\\"<br />4.  Great traders are flexible and resilient.<br />5.  It takes time (probably many years) for a trader to succeed.<br />6.  It is imperative to formulate a trading philosophy which integrates market concepts and trading methods.<br />7.  Every great trader has a specific \\"edge.\\" (What are your answers to the  questions listed on page 301?)<br />8.  Great traders develop and then sustain a high level of self-confidence.<br />9.  Successful trading requires a FULL-TIME commitment.<br />10. Market \\"wizards\\" are bold and innovative but not reckless and impulsive.<br />11. They are willing to accept a loss while rigorously controlling risk.<br />12. They may view undervaluation as a necessary condition for purchasing a stock but never as a sufficient condition.<br />13. Their transactions are guided and informed by a trading model based on  catalysts.<br />14. Market \\"wizards\\" pay at least as much attention to \\"when to get out\\" as they do to \\"when to get in\\"<br />15. Market \\"wizards\\" know themselves (warts and all), work very hard, trust their own judgment, constantly review/evaluate decisions, and are patient.<br />For about the cost of a breakfast at a restaurant in the Wall Street area, Schwager introduces his reader to 15 immensely successful stock traders and then allows the reader to \\"eavesdrop\\" on in-depth interviews of them. Schwager also helps his reader to compare and contrast their mindsets, strategies, and convictions. A value-added benefit is the provision an Appendix in which Schwager discusses \\"Options: Understanding the Basics.\\"  For novice investors, this book is an invaluable source of wisdom on HOW NOT TO THINK and WHAT NOT TO DO.<br />I presume to suggest that there is another audience for this book which Schwager may not have had in mind when writing it. I refer to those who are now involved in start-up preparations or who have already launched a new company. Whether or not an IPO is one of their objectives, they can learn a great deal of value from the \\"Stock Market Wizards\\" in terms of allocation of resources (especially human capital), \\"early-warning signs\\", and crisis management.

The idea is to let general investors mine for insights that might help them when they're putting together their own portfolios.\\" Zygmont organizes his material within 12 chapters and then offers his conclusions about \\"The Composite VC\\" followed by a list of VC firms and investor and entrepreneur resources. His formula is really very simple and straightforward: \\"Ask them.\\" He interviewed a number of the most successful venture capitalists who, at the time of the interviews, were associated with the most prominent VC firms. What do they share in common other than the obvious (intelligence, courage, ability to tolerance risk, high energy level, etc.)? Commitment, idealism, honesty, charm, pride, and reverence (or humility).  This book will be of greatest value to those who are preparing to seek venture capital, obviously, but can also be of substantial value to senior-level executives who ask this question: \\"What would a venture capitalist have to say about my company?\\" Although the responses from those whom Zygmont interviewed would probably vary, perhaps significantly, all would probably ask essentially the same questions before making an evaluation. If you share my high regard for this book, I urge you to check out Done Deals and Inside the Minds.	2001-04-23

So, at the outset, permit me to suggest that the length of this book becomes relevant only if you have no interest in human greatness. Yes, Wooden was probably the greatest basketball coach (if not the greatest coach) who ever lived but, for me, he is infinitely more interesting as a fellow human being, albeit one who possesses exceptional qualities of character. His \\"Pyramid of Success\\" is only secondarily a \\"guide\\" to success in athletic competition. Its greater value (as his former players unanimously attest) is derived from its relevance to virtually all areas of human experience. Johnson organizes his material within seven chapters:<br />John Wooden's Legendary Achievements<br />Biography of John Wooden<br />The Official Pyramid of Success Lecture<br />Opening Interview with John Wooden<br />Woodenisms, Maxisms, and Poems<br />Interviews, Reflections, and Comments<br />Closing Interviews with John Wooden<br />For me, the interviews are most interesting. Almost all of the names of those interviewed are unfamiliar to me but throughout their observations, there are  recurrent themes: Wooden was kind and thoughtful but a strict disciplinarian, prepared for each practice as well as for each game with meticulous care, was highly competitive, had non-negotiable personal values, was most proud of his role as a teacher, viewed unsportsmanlike conduct with contempt, and never EVER offered an alibi after a rare defeat. Most people do not know that he was an outstanding high school and college player, and, that he toiled in anonymity at U.C.L.A. for many years before his teams began to win national championships.<br />Many years ago while I was head coach of the varsity basketball team at a New England boarding school, I attended a clinic in Boston. Coach Wooden was the featured speaker. After dinner with friends, I returned to my hotel and saw him seated alone in the coffee shop. I approached him, introduced myself, and thanked him  for all I learned from his presentation. He invited me to join him and then, for about 30 minutes, asked me about my team, our competition, and what my basic strategies were for offense and defense. I indicated that I was having some problems with the full-court zone press. He used several napkins to diagram a solution to the problems. I thanked him, we shook hands, and I went up to my room. Two weeks later, I received in the mail a handwritten note from him wishing our team well, accompanied by a single sheet on which \\"The Pyramid of Power\\" was illustrated.<br />John Wooden was a great human being long before his teams at U.C.L.A. began to win national championships and he remains a great man in the years following his retirement. No doubt age has taken its toll on his body but, as recent television interviews suggest, his mind is as sharp as ever. Also unchanged is his heart, one which is filled with love for basketball, of course, but all also for all the people whose lives he has touched (and whose lives have touched his) along the way.<br />This book isn't primarily about coaching basketball although, for those of us who love the game, it provides an abundance of information otherwise unavailable. Rather, it is about an extraordinary man who has always been an avid student and, in the best sense of the word, continues to be an outstanding teacher. He has nourished so many other lives.

Several years ago, an article in Inc. magazine generated so much interest that it led to the publication of a book, Semper Fi, in which Dan Carrison and Rod Walsh advocate a \\"business boot camp\\" based on a model provided by the U.S. Marine Corps. In his own book, Ryan provides a number of invaluable \\"lessons\\" which can be learned by those who attend his High-Tech Start-up Book Camp in Montana. (Actually, these same \\"lessons\\" can be of great value to anyone else who is also involved with launching or developing a start-up company.) Ryan organizes his material within seven chapters, following an approach \\"built on my years of negotiating the peaks and valleys of running (and financing) a successful company. [He founded Ascend Communications in 1989. Under his leadership, its revenue climbed from $16-million to $1.3-billion in five years and was eventually purchased by Lucent Technologies for $22-billion in 1999.] It's a carefully staged process that beings with building the proper team and ends with managing your board of investors.\\" In Chapter 1, Ryan discusses several types of Entrepreneurial Wannabes. In subsequent chapters he guides his reader through the \\"carefully staged process\\" and concludes with an Epilogue in which he explains why only a few start-up companies make it and why most others don't.<br />With all due respect to Ryan's insightful comments and recommendations, one of this book's greatest benefits is derived from the series of questions which he poses. For example, after a 3,000-mile journey from Boston to meet with Ryan at his Roaring Lion, one entrepreneur set up to present a slide presentation. Before it began, Ryan asked \\"Why would anyone want your product? What is the application? What is the value proposition to the customer? Who is the customer? Is anyone else doing this stuff, and are they successful?\\" You get the idea. Ryan seems to have too much respect for others' time and energy (as well as for his own) to beat around the proverbial bush. Throughout the book, he gets right to the point. Actually, to a number of separate but interrelated key points.<br />This book reminds me of O'Toole's The Executive's Compass in the sense that reading that book is no substitute for partcipating in an Executive Seminar sponsored by the Aspen Institute. Similarly, reading Ryan's book is no substitute for participating in his boot camp in Montana. (I hasten to add, neither he nor O'Toole makes such a claim.) My own rather extensive prior experience with start-ups and already-ups suggests that it is extremely difficult to get honest (preferably frank) feedback from family members and friends. (Perhaps they do not want to hurt feelings. Perhaps they feel unqualified to express an opinion. Whatever.) As a result, the most important questions are often not asked...and therefore not answered. Ryan asks all manner of such \\"tough\\" questions, as previously indicated, and then (when he deems it appropriate) suggests some possible answers. If the unexamined life is not work living, the unexamined business idea is not worth developing.<br />Although Ryan may not have had this objective in mind when writing this book with Phaedra Hise, it can also be of substantial value as a \\"reality check\\" for decision-makers in well-established businesses. Their answers to the cluster of questions may once have been correct when formulated but that is not necessarily true now.<br />Whoever you are, whatever the size and nature of your organization, regardless of its location amidst what Adizes calls \\"corporate lifecycles\\", this book offers an \\"intellectual boot camp\\" in which I urge you to engage your mind ASAP.h.

Specifically, they explain:<br />? How to identify the system?s purpose and goals, deciding which customers to include and how to group them into natural segments that reflect their interests and purchasing patterns<br />? How to use qualitative research to build the ?lens of the customer?, a model of customer views of the products and services that you provide, customer satisfaction, and the loyalty and retention that result<br />? How to use the lens of the customer to build a customer survey to measure quality, satisfaction, and loyalty<br />? How to use the lens again in analyzing data from the customer survey, both to determine what could be done to improve customer satisfaction and to assess the probable effect of each potential improvement on bottom-line financial performance<br />? How to set priorities for quality improvement, using the information developed from the survey as background for business decisions, and then implement the decisions according to the priorities set by management<br />Whew! That?s a lot! Fortunately, Johnson and Gustafsson devote a separate chapter to each of the five stages of the process.. They also provide three valuable appendices: A mini-case study of the Ratorp Tire Company, the NACS Customer Satisfaction Survey, and a Data Analysis in Practice. If your organization needs to improve customer satisfaction, loyalty, and profit, here is an excellent source.	2001-04-21
2025851:US	51147790	R2ZFNITWDFJGUK	0385499841	662418665	The Art of Innovation: Lessons in Creativity from IDEO, America's Leading Design Firm	Books	5	28	30	N	N	Innovation for Fun as Well as Profit	There are dozens of excellent books which discuss innovation. This is one of the best but don't be misled by the title, \\"Lessons in creativity from IDEO, America's leading design firm.\\" Unlike almost all other authors of worthy books on the same subject, Kelley does NOT organize his material in terms of a sequence of specific \\"lessons\\"...nor does he inundate his reader with checklists, \\"executive summaries\\", bullet points, do's and don'ts, \\"key points\\", etc. Rather, he shares what I guess you could characterize as \\"stories\\" based on real-world situations in which he and his IDEO associates solved various problems when completing industrial design assignments for their clients. \\"We've linked those organizational achievements to specific methodologies and tools you can use to build innovation into your own organization...[However, IDEO's] `secret formula' is actually not very formulaic. It's a blend of of methodologies, work practices, culture, and infrastructure. Methodology alone is not enough.\\" One of the greatest benefits of the book is derived from direct access to that \\"blend\\" when activated.<br />It is extremely difficult to overcome what James O'Toole characterizes, in Leading Change, as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" He and Kelley seem to be kindred spirits: Both fully understand how and why truly innovative thinking encounters so much resistance within organizations. Whereas O'Toole suggests all manner of strategies to overcome that resistance, Kelley concentrates on the combination (\\"blend\\") of ingredients which, when integrated and then applied with both rigor and passion, may (just may) produce what Jobs once referred to as \\"insanely great.\\" What both O'Toole and Kelley have in mind is creating and sustaining an innovative culture, one from within which \\"insanely great\\" ideas can result in breakthrough products and (yes) services.<br />\\"Loosely described\\", Kelley shares IDEO's five-step methodology: Understand the market, the client, the technology, and the perceived constraints on the given problem; observe real people in real-life situations; literally visualize new-to-the-world concepts AND the customers who will use them; evaluate and refine the prototypes in a series of quick iterations; and finally, implement the new concept for commercialization. With regard to the last \\"step\\", as Bennis explains in Organizing Genius, Apple executives immediately recognized the commercial opportunities for PARC's technology. Larry Tesler (who later left PARC for Apple) noted that Jobs and companions \\"wanted to get it out to the world.\\" But first, obviously, create that \\"it.\\"<br />Kelley and his associates at IDEO have won numerous awards for designing all manner of innovative products such as the Apple mouse, the Palm Pilot, a one-piece fishing mechanism for children, the in-vehicle beverage holder,  toothpaste tubes that don't \\"gunk up\\" in the cap area, \\"mud-free\\" water bottles for mountain bikers, a small digital camera for the handspring Visor, and the Sun Tracker Beach Chair.<br />With all due respect to products such as these, what interested me most was the material in the book which focuses on (a) the physical environment in which those at IDEO interact and (b) the nature and extent of that interaction, principally the brainstorm sessions. In the Foreword, Tom Peters has this in mind when explaining why Kelley's is a marvelous book: \\"It carefully walks us through each stage of the IDEO innovation process -- from creating hot teams (IDEO is perpetually on `boil') to learning to see through the customer's eyes (forget focus groups!) and brainstorming (trust me, nobody but nobody does it better) to rapid prototyping (and nobody, but nobody does it better...).\\" Whatever your current situation, whatever the size and nature of your organization, surely you and it need to avoid or escape from \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" Granted, you may never be involved in the creation of an \\"insanely great\\" product but Kelley can at least help you to gain \\"the true spirit of innovation\\" in your life. I join him in wishing you \\"some serious fun.\\"\\"insanely great\\" product but Kelley can at least help you to gain \\"the true spirit of innovation\\" in your life.

There is nothing new in this book nor does Bennis make that claim. He has observed that this book offers his last and best comments on the subject of leadership. In it, he has assembled his best ideas from a number of previous books he authored or co-authored. Let us all hope that this is not his final contribution to the subject.<br />Bennis begins with an especially apt quotation of T.S. Eliot's comments on his cat The Rum Tum Tugger: \\"For he will do as he will do, and there's no doing anything about it. When you let him in, then he wants out; he's always in the wrong side of the door.\\" As an owner of countless cats myself for more than 20 years, I can personally affirm that Eliot's cat is normal. It really makes no difference what you name a cat nor what you say to it. The best advice I can offer is to remember that a dog's idea of God is a human being but that a cat's idea of God is a cat. For thousands of years, the human race has deified certain rulers (e.g. Caesars), many of whom (like cats) saw themselves as deities. Until recently, many corporate CEOs embraced the \\"command and control\\" leadership style. Several of them are on record as viewing themselves as omniscient and omnipotent, victims of what I characterize as \\"The Ozmanias Syndrome\\" which is inevitably fatal for them and often for their spheres of influence as well.<br /><br />Back to Bennis and this book. To those who aspire to lead people, here's his advice: \\"Be humble. Stop trying to `herd cats' and start building trust and mutual respect. Your `cats' will respond. They will sense your purpose, keep your business purring, and even kill your rats.\\" Bennis' clever use of similes and metaphors aside, I rate this volume so highly for three reasons. First, it offers what is probably the most personal glimpse we are likely to have of Bennis, very much in the same spirit as Stephen King's On Writing. Also, Bennis is deeply concerned about an ever-worsening \\"leadership crisis\\" of global proportions. He explains why others should share that concern. Finally, as noted earlier, he assembles in this volume his most important insights and observations on the subject of leadership. For that last reason, I am most grateful (much as I enjoyed the pleasure of his personal company) because those insights and observations suggest HOW to respond to the aforementioned \\"leadership crisis.\\"<br />Bennis organizes his material with two Sections (The Leadership Crisis and What Makes a Leader?) and an Epilogue (Reflections on Retirement). Drawing upon  personal experiences which extend back to his childhood, Bennis explains why he views self-invention as an exercise of the imagination: \\"That's basically how we get to know ourselves. People who can't invent and then reinvent themselves must be content with borrowed postures, secondhand ideas, fitting in instead of standing out. Inventing oneself is the opposite of accepting the roles we were brought up to play.\\" This is an affirmation with profound implications. Those who possess sufficient courage, determination, and (yes) endurance to gain self-knowledge will eventually achieve beneficial change. So long as this immensely difficult process continues, periodic reinvention is inevitable.<br />Meanwhile, paradoxically, Bennis suggests that there are certain human values which must remain constant throughout that process.  They include integrity, dedication, magnanimity, humility, openness, and creativity. Values-driven leaders, while increasing their self-knowledge, must possess non-negotiable standards of moral and intellectual honesty. They must have a passionate belief in something. They must be \\"noble of mind and heart; generous in forgiving; above revenge and resentment.\\" As Bennis observes, \\"Magnanimous and humble people are notable for their self-possession. They know who they are, have healthy egos, and take more pride in what they do than in who they are.\\" They must be willing to try what is new and be receptive to new ideas, however bizarre, with \\"a tolerance for ambiguity and change, and a rejection of any and all preconceived prejudices, biases, and stereotypes.\\" With regard to creativity, Bennis asserts that \\"we must restore our sense of wonder, break through our own preconceptions and see everything new and fresh -- as we did when we were children.\\" In sum, leaders have both vision and virtue.<br />In his Epilogue, during which he reflects on the subject of retirement, Bennis shares two basic ideas. First, that all of his own personal heroes \\"were always in transition. They were always redesigning, recomposing and reinventing their own lives. Also, \\"that people who have been successful in their careers and in life are also successful in all transitions.\\" This book is really not about \\"herding cats\\"; rather, it is about principled self-governance. It is also about values-driven leadership as (in effect) a \\"work in progress\\" throughout transitions in life. Now more than ever before, our world desperately needs leaders whose vision will inspire us and whose virtue will guide us during our own quest for self-knowledge from one transition to the next.more pride in what they do than in who they are.\\" They must be willing to try what is new and be receptive to new ideas, however bizarre, with \\"a tolerance for ambiguity and change, and a rejection of any and all preconceived prejudices, biases, and stereotypes.\\" With regard to creativity, Bennis asserts that \\"we must restore our sense of wonder, break through our own preconceptions and see everything new and fresh -- as we did when we were children.\\" In sum, leaders have both vision and virtue.<br />In his Epilogue, during which he reflects on the subject of retirement, Bennis shares two basic ideas.

Perhaps my expectations were unrealistic but I had hoped for some penetrating insights; instead, I found recycled material from previous publications. Shula is among the greatest football coaches ever but has also achieved great success in an equally competitive environment, the restaurant business, so I had hoped for some of his observations about that. None. Blanchard is among the  most innovative thinkers about business and presumably sees all manner of subtle but significant correlations between a great CEO and a great coach. None. From a marketing standpoint, the book's concept is clever. In terms of execution, borrowing a situation from football, it is a fumble on the authors' own goal line.	2001-04-16

Along the way, he shares his reactions to (and in some instances, his direct encounters with) various major political figures such as Fiorello LaGuardia, William O'Dwyer, Harry Truman, Thomas Dewey, Dwight Eisenhower, Joseph McCarthy, Robert Wagner, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton. My personal favorites are those passages in which he shares his thoughts and feelings about Learned Hand, Dean Acheson, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt (in \\"retrospective\\"). Most of these essays originally appeared in The New Yorker. Perhaps you read those when they were first published. They are even more enjoyable to read now, especially within the sequence of presentation in this book. What adds substantially to the reader's pleasure is the high quality of Hamburger's writing style which is, in my opinion, places him in the company of George Orwell and E.B. White. Hamburger has a delicious sense of humor and a keen eye for significant detail. Within his commentaries on various world leaders, he is never reluctant to share his own strong opinions about a given subject such as \\"McCarthyism.\\"<br />Please allow me a rather personal way in which to express my appreciation of this book. As I read it, I felt as if Hamburger and I had just completed dinner and adjourned to the living room with a beverage in hand. \\"As you look back over all those years and reflect on all those experiences, what are your most vivid memories of the people you observed? Which moments remain indelible? From today's perspective, what do you make of all that?\\" Obviously, this is a hypothetical situation but his responses can be found in this immensely entertaining as well as informative book.<br />In the final chapter, \\"Postscript: Vermeer Time\\", Hamburger discusses his great good fortune (in the spring of 1996) in being able to see the Vermeer exhibition at the National Gallery where he was greeted by Arthur K. Wheelock, the museum's curator of northern baroque paintings and co-curator of the exhibition.

Perhaps you have already read Ehrbar's EVA. He quite correctly points out that there can be many challenges to implementing a program based on EVA principles. He characterizes it as \\"a superior measure of corporate performance, one that is tied more directly to share than any other performance measure, by charging profit for the cost of all the capital a company employs, including equity.\\"<br />More specifically:<br /> \\"It is the framework for a complete financial management and  incentive compensation system that can guide every decision a  company makes...that can transform corporate culture, that can<br /> improve the working lives of everyone in an organization by  making them more successful, and that can help them produce  greater wealth for shareholders, customers, and themselves.\\"<br />Stern and Shiely (with Irwin Ross) focus on the specific challenges which will probably be encountered when initiates are taken to implement value-added change in an organization. They suggest all manner of strategies and tactics to achieve that objective, agreeing with O'Toole's key points in Leading Change when he analyzes what he calls \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\"<br />For the authors of this book, there have been two major developments in American capitalism which explain  why \\"the opportunity cost of capital\\" has been miscalculated: \\"(1) the split between ownership and control of publicly held corporations and (2) the widespread acceptance of accounting measurements [i.e. GAAP] to gauge corporate value, a purpose for which they were never intended.\\" Having defined and then analyzed various problems in Chapter 1, the authors proceed into 12 more chapters whose titles suggest their focal points: The Solution, The Need for a Winning Strategy and Organization, The Road Map to Value Creation, The Changes wrought by EVA, Extending EVA to the Shop Floor [an absolute imperative], Getting the Message Out: Training and Communications, EVA and Acquisitions, EVA Incentives, How EVA Can Fail [and it does...the authors explain why], New Frontiers: real Options and Forward-Looking Eva, 25 Questions [which must be answered fully or forget about EVA], and finally, a Recipe for Success. The book then provides its own value-added benefit: an Epilogue written by Gregory V. Milano which discusses EVA and the \\"New Economy.\\"<br />Briefly, I would like to comment on Chapter 13 which offers a \\"Recipe for Success.\\" The authors introduce and explain six key factors.  Having already acknowledged various forms of resistance and resentment which implementation of EVA principles may well encounter, the authors understand full well that these factors may offer the promise of success but by no means guarantee it. They are:<br />1. \\"The company must have a viable business strategy and appropriate organizational architecture before EVA can boost performance.\\"<br />2.  To achieve full potential of EVA, a company should install all of EVA's components -- a measurement system, a management system, and an incentive system.\\"<br />3.  An EVA incentive plan is essential, and it should reach as far down in the organization as possible.\\"<br />4.  \\"A comprehensive training program is equally essential. It should not be limited to top executives but should infiltrate all managerial levels and, ideally, reach down to the shop floor.\\"<br />5.  \\"The EVA program must have the full and fervent backing of the CEO, who should chair all the all-important steering committee that puts EVA in place.\\"<br />6.  \\"The CFO and/or the controller should be equally committed. Because they have to deal simultaneously with standard accounting practices, these specialists may have an even greater problem focusing on value creation than a CEO newly introduced to EVA.\\"<br />Stern and Shiely (with Ross) offer a comprehensive, cohesive, and cost-effective program which, after appropriate modification, can be of substantial benefit to almost any organization, regardless of its size or nature. Milano's insights are especially important in 2001 as so many organizations are attempting (with mixed success) to reconcile the basic principles of the so-called \\"Old\\" and \\"New\\" economies. (I hope they or Ehrbar next write a book which explains how EVA can be of greatest benefit to privately-owned smaller companies.) Drucker was right: \\"Until a company returns a profit that is greater than its cost of capital, it operates at a loss.\\" We have all manner of mechanisms by which to determine the exact net worth of an individual executive. Properly understood, EVA principles can do the same for an organization IF if those who lead that organization are guided and informed by the aforementioned \\"six key factors.\\" If you share my high regard for this book as well as Ehrbar's, you are urged to check out Fitz-enz's The ROI of Human Capital.its size or nature.

The topic was \\"Creative Destruction -- or Just Destruction?\\" Those who presented papers were asked to address \\"the key technological, regulatory, organizational, and competitive dynamics compelling change in the way firms and stakeholders do business in an increasingly global and Internet-centric society.\\" At the symposium there were (and in this volume there are) four points which are consistent with the theme of \\"creative destruction\\":<br />The Destruction of Traditional Industry Structures<br />The Destruction of Traditional Regulatory Structures<br />The Destruction of Traditional Competitive Positioning Strategies<br />The Destruction of Traditional Technological Assumptions<br />It is important to keep in mind that this is not a manual. Although there are numerous suggestions, checklists, points of emphasis, graphic illustrations, and examples offered, the volume's primary purpose is to stimulate continued discussion and debate on the major challenges now facing firms, governments, and other players -- while suggesting \\"how to exploit the new opportunities created by creative dynamics.\\"<br />The material is organized within five Parts: Introduction, Theory and Practice of Creative Destruction, The Global Context for Creative Destruction, Business Destruction Strategies in the Global Internet Economy, and Creative Business Survival Strategies.

Another guess (only a guess) is that, based on what is now happening (and not happening) in the global community, he would suggest that process of \\"creative destruction\\" in all organizations (regardless of their size or nature) has only begun. The Chinese character for the word \\"crisis\\" has two meanings: \\"peril\\" and \\"opportunity.\\" For many (perhaps most) organizations, the process of creative destruction means death; for others, it offers the opportunity for at least survival and perhaps regeneration.

There are three recent publications with the same title (Creative Destruction) whose authors correlate Joseph Schumpeter's concept of  \\"creative destruction\\" with the contemporary business world. Foster and Kaplan explain \\"why companies that are built to last underperform the market -- and how to successfully transform them\\" whereas in their work,  Nolan and Croson offer \\"a six-stage process for transforming the organization.\\" In the third volume co-edited by McKnight, Vaaler, and Katz, various authors and co-authors of 13 anthologized essays examine various \\"business survival strategies for the global Internet economy.\\" I highly recommend all three volumes as well as two of Schumpeter's works: Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, and, Essays: On Entrepreneurs, Innovations, Business Cycles, and the Evolution of Capitalism.<br />As already indicated, Nolan and Croson present and explain a \\"six-stage process for transforming the organization\\" at a time when there are extraordinary demands upon today's executives. For example, they must have or quickly gain mastery of new information technologies, new organizational structures, and managing a new dominant sector of employment: professional entrepreneurs. Worse yet, they confront what the authors characterize as \\"four main sources of inertia\\": business as usual, IT that locks in \\"business as usual\\", not evolving into an IT-enabled organizational structure, and finally, workers who are not going to fire themselves. What to do? In Chapter One, the authors recommend 20 information economy management principles, half of which have been \\"salvaged\\" from the industrial economy. (See Exhibit 1-2 on pages 16-17.) Then in Chapter Two, they introduce what they call \\"The Six Stages of Creative Destruction\\": Downsize!, Seek Dynamic Balance, Develop a Market-Access Strategy, Become Customer Driven, Develop a Market-Foreclosure Strategy, and finally, Pursue Global Scope. The authors devote a separate chapter to each of these \\"Stages\\", explaining with eloquence as well as practicality HOW to complete what is indeed an immensely difficult process.<br />It is important to keep in mind that Schumpeter was an advocate of \\"dynamic disequilibrium\\": entrepreneurship is the rule, NOT the exception. Entrepreneurs (by nature) engage in a process of creative destruction as they challenge what O'Toole characterizes (in Leading Change) as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" They dismantle the old order of economic activity (technological, organizational, and managerial) and simultaneously invent and build a new one. Nolan and Croson are quite correct when suggesting that \\"creative destruction\\" must be driven by an entrepreneurial spirit but also requires leadership and management skills of the very highest order.<br />In the final chapter, the authors suggest that an organization's starting point when embarking on \\"The Six Stages of Creative Destruction\\" determines which of two scenarios to follow: \\"The first, and easiest, takes an organization from a hierarchy with an established, but still informal, shadow network, to a fully IT-enabled network organization....A second transformation scenario, rather more difficult that the first, takes a traditional functional hierarchy directly to a fully IT-enabled network organization, without passing through the shadow network to rest.\\"  ABB, ADP, AT&amp;T, FedEx, GE, General Mills, Intel, Microsoft, Motorola, Morgan Stanley, and PepsiCo are among the corporate organizations which have successfully completed \\"The Six Stages of Creative Destruction\\", transforming themselves to become viable information economy competitors. They have exhibited extraordinary discipline in the consistency and efficiency while doing so. Although the authors cite major organizations such as these to illustrate key points, my own opinion is that, with appropriate modification,  \\"The Six Stages of Creative Destruction\\" can also help small-to-midsize organizations to transformthemselves as well.<br />For executives in all manner of organizations, the Appendix (\\"What Size Is Right? A Theory and Simulation of Firm Design\\") may be one of the most useful sections in the book. For example, after having observed theoretical organizational behavior under a variety of assumptions over hundreds of situations, Nolan and Croson gained \\"some interesting insights\\" into how technology and organization \\"gradually combine in the downsizing process.\\" They derived these principles which can guide and inform executives: (1) :The lion's share of gains comes from revolution, not evolution (NOTE: Hamel's Leading the Revolution as well as Evans and Wurster's Blown to Bits strongly support this principle.); (2) \\"Mixed span of control means more revolutions\\"; and (3) \\"Random technology means more revolutions.\\" Now more than ever before, incumbent organizations must adopt and then integrate technology ASAP to maintain their competitive advantages. And that adoption must be completed with both rigor and passion as the velocity of creative destruction accelerates globally at a rate Schumpeter could not possibly have envisioned 40-50 years ago.m themselves as well. <br />For executives in all manner of organizations, the Appendix (\\"What Size Is Right?

In fact, most of the material in this book has been recycled or updated from previous publications, notably from Slater's excellent Jack Welch and the GE Way and The GE Way Fieldbook, both of which I also highly recommend. Slater is an excellent judge of material and writes very well. After more than 25 years as a successful journalist, he has developed a keen sense of what key business issues are, and, how Welch's comments on those issues can be most effectively shared with the reader. Two factors set this book apart from most other business books which also share \\"secrets.\\" First and obviously, Welch's well-deserved reputation as a great leader. Also, the business context in which Slater anchors each of the 29 key points. With brevity and precision, Slater addresses questions such as these:<br />*  How to \\"harness the power of change\\"?<br />*  What does \\"Face Reality!\\" mean? Also, what does it require?<br />*  What is the best process for evaluating your organization with a \\"fresh eye\\"?<br />*  What are the major perils as well as benefits of Six Sigma initiatives?<br />*  What are some of the most effective e-business strategies?<br />*  How can e-business \\"put the final nail in bureaucracy\\"?<br />Thanks to Slater, as I read the book I felt as if Welch himself were making a series of assertions directly to me.  In response to each I am inclined to ask, \\"Exactly what does he mean by that?\\" An explanation then follows, based on the wealth of information about Welch which Slater and others have accumulated over the years. Slater also includes a series of lists of \\"Welch Rules\\" and then, in an Appendix, a list of \\"GE Values\\"...the same list which (reproduced on a laminated card) is carried by each GE employee.<br /> Welch himself has been and continues to be an avid student of business. Time and again, he has gratefully acknowledged what he has learned, not only from other great business leaders but also from his associates at GE...especially from younger GE executives who share his contempt for what Jim O'Toole has characterized (in Leading Change) as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\"<br />If you share my great admiration of Jack Welch and also wish you could spend some time with him one-on-one, here's probably your best opportunity to do so.

Katzenbach is himself the author or co-author of a number of brilliantly conceived and executed studies, notably The Wisdom of Teams and Real Change Leaders. In this book, his central thesis is that \\"an integrated balance of real team, individual, and single-leader working group performance is both possible and desirable at the top -- not that one mode is intrinsically better than the other.\\" The key phrase is \\"integrated balance.\\" Whatever the size and nature of your organization, Katzenbach offers \\"three major messages\\":<br />1. The best senior leadership groups are rarely a true team at the top -- although they can and do function as real teams when major, unexpected events prompt that behavior.<br />2. Most of the team members can optimize their performance as a group by consciously working to obtain a better balance between their team and non-team efforts -- rather than by trying to become an ongoing single team.<br />3. The secret to better balance lies in learning to integrate the discipline required for team performance with the discipline of executive (single-leader) behavior -- not in replacing one with the other.<br />This third \\"message\\" is especially relevant to smaller companies, probably privately-owned, in which the CEO (the archetypical single-leader) is either the founder or related to the founder. In such companies, the need for an \\"integrated balance\\" may be even greater than it is for much larger organizations. Katzenbach organizes his material within nine chapters. Rather than list their titles, I have selected a few key passages which, hopefully, will suggest the potential value of this book to you and your own organization's specific needs and interests.<br />Executive Leadership Discipline requires an individual to \\"create and maintain urgency, resolve the critical strategic issues, enforce individual accountability, leverage executive time, make the tough decisions individually, pick the best individuals for the key jobs, and periodically raise the bar.\\" (Chapter One)<br />\\"The notion of `leadership capacity' implies a system of leadership, if you will, that can extract leadership wisdom, insight, and behaviors from many more individuals. [This is obviously essential to concensus-building.] Thus it fuels the continuing search for different kinds of leadership approaches, both individual and joint, at all levels of the organization.\\" (Chapter Three)<br />Team Leadership Discipline requires members to \\"create a meaningful purpose, commit to a team performance goals, be mutually accountable (no member can fail... only the team fails), commit to real work, share decision among members, strive for the right skill mix, and establish the height of the bar.\\" (Chapter Four)<br />\\"Integrating real team performance with executive leadership performance requires both a sharp understanding of the differences between the two two disciplines required and a relentless determination to integrate the two. It is hard work, counterintuitive, and outside the comfort zone of most senior executives. Nevertheless, it is well worth the effort.\\" (Chapter Nine)<br />In Appendix B, Katzenbach offers this definition of a real team: \\"A small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable.\\" My own opinion is that unless an organization has the two disciplines (both executive leadership and team leadership) in appropriate balance, it will probably have neither. Hopefully, this brief commentary will encourage you to read and then re-read this important book. Also, to check out the other books authored or co-authored by Katzenbach., it will probably have neither.

Initially and for several decades to follow, groups of executives would gather together for two weeks under Adler's leadership to discuss the Great Ideas...what Adler once described as \\"the great conversation across the centuries.\\" Along the way, O'Toole became involved and today conducts Leading Change seminars. (You are urged to read his book which bears that title.) In the Foreword to this book, Lodwrick M. Cook explains O'Toole's use of the central metaphor: \\"The beauty of the compass is that it provides a framework for the executive to create order out of the growing chaos of cultural diversity and conflict of values. Like a real compass, [O'Toole's `value compass'] helps us to find where we are, where others are, where we want to go, and how to get there. Like the Aspen experience itself, O'Toole's compass is aimed at developing executive judgment by expanding our understanding of the interrelationships of fundamental values.\\" Whose values? They range from those of ancient Greece (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and Sophocles) through those of the Enlightenment (Locke, Hobbes, Rousseau, Jefferson, Hamilton, and Madison) and then those more contemporary within intellectual history (Emerson, Thoreau, Marx, Mill, Freud, Hayek, Schumpeter, Friedman, Postman, and Berlin). One way or another, directly or indirectly, each of the Great Ideas can help each of us in our own quest for \\"the good society.\\" Hence the importance of the compass. I wish it were possible to recreate it graphically in combination with this brief commentary. It has four points (Liberty, Efficiency, Equality, and Community) and the tensions between and among them create what James MacGregor Burns has described as \\"the deadlock of democracy.\\"<br />As I can personally attest, the Executive Seminar is an exceptionally rigorous intellectual experience. Groups of approximately 20 persons spend a week together, with group discussions led by two carefully selected co-moderators. As O'Toole explains in the Introduction, his intention when writing this book was to assist executives in five roles they play. \\"One, as managers engaged in making `purely business' decisions: by recognizing and properly addressing the broad social implications of such decisions, they can bring out more effective organizational performance. Two, as managers whose internal policies turn out to affect outside constituencies. Three, as managers who are participants and partners in government....Four, as citizens who vote and volunteer in political organizations. Finally, five, as individuals who choose to examine their own lives and their own personal legacies to society.\\" It would be a serious mistake to view Great Ideas as being impractical or somehow irrelevant to everyday human experience. On the contrary, as O'Toole brilliantly explains, they can (indeed should) invest that experience with meaning, direction, and ultimate value.<br />To whom specifically do I recommend this book? First, to organizational executives who believe in vales-driven leadership and wish to participate in (and be nourished by) what Adler characterizes as \\"the great conversation across the centuries\\" with those who generated or refined Great Ideas throughout the past 2,500 years. Second, to those recently embarked on a business career who need a \\"values compass\\" as they encounter what O'Toole has described (in Leading Change) as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" Finally, to those who wish to gain at least a sense of what the nature of discourse would be, were they to participate in one of the Executive Seminars sponsored by the Aspen Institute.  ....ionally rigorous intellectual experience.

Finally, five, as individuals who choose to examine their own lives and their own personal legacies to society.\\" It would be a serious mistake to view Great Ideas as being impractical or somehow irrelevant to everyday human experience. On the contrary, as O'Toole brilliantly explains, they can (indeed should) invest that experience with meaning, direction, and ultimate value.<br />To whom specifically do I recommend this book? First, to organizational executives who believe in vales-driven leadership and wish to participate in (and be nourished by) what Adler characterizes as \\"the great conversation across the centuries\\" with those who generated or refined Great Ideas throughout the past 2,500 years. Second, to those recently embarked on a business career who need a \\"values compass\\" as they encounter what O'Toole has described (in Leading Change) as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\" Finally, to those who wish to gain at least a sense of what the nature of discourse would be, were they to participate in one of the Executive Seminars sponsored by the Aspen Institute.  ....	2001-04-09

The original meaning of the word \\"adventure\\" evolved from \\"what comes or happens by chance\\" (i.e. luck) to \\"hazardous undertaking.\\" Looser and Schlapfer perhaps had this in mind as they collaborated on this book. In it, they provide a step-by-step in introduction to the concepts needed to prepare a business plan and then to arrange the financing of a business idea; also, the basic knowledge needed to participate effectively in subsequent discussions and negotiations and to ask the right questions; also, the necessary business language (i.e. all the jargon and technical expressions one needs to know), explained by the authors and augmented by a very useful Glossary; finally, a References section for further reading. They organize their material within four Parts:<br />Starting Up a Company -- How Companies Grow<br />The Business Idea -- Concept and Presentation<br />Developing the Business Plan<br />Valuing a Start-Up and Raising Equity<br />Looser and Schlapfer are well aware of the fact that a reputable venture capital firm annually funds (on average) only one business plan of every 500 considered. (In 1999, Draper Fisher Jurvetson received almost 20,000 business plans.) Obviously, competition is ferocious.  As the authors explain, their manual \\"is aimed at helping you through the first stage of starting up an innovative, high-growth company: writing a professional business plan....The trick is to take advantage of promising, innovative ideas, research and technology, and financing in the form of venture capital investment funds to achieve a breakthrough.\\" There are three stages to the start-up process: First, put the business idea down on paper and analyze its marketability of on the basis of a few key indicators. (the authors identify and explain them.) Next, develop the idea into a detailed business plan which obtains the funds needed. Finally, build the company to profitability according to the business plan. (The authors suggest several \\"next steps\\", including the withdrawal of investors.) Part 3 is perhaps the most valuable section of the book because it provides a comprehensive, step-by-step explanation of HOW to formulate a proper business plan. Another valuable section is located in the Appendix: the \\"Extended Table of Contents\\"(ETC). After you have read the book, I urge you to review the ETC at least weekly. Why? Because it can serve as a check list of possible \\"early-warning signs\\" to which you and your associates must constantly be alert.

Eadie examines what he calls &quot;seven keys to high-impact governance.&quot; He organizes his excellent material within six chapters, several of which conclude with &quot;A Closing Word&quot;, &quot;In Conclusion&quot; or &quot;In Closing&quot; commentary which summarizes key points. Here are the six chapter titles:<br />Getting a Handle on the Work of Governing<br />Developing the Board as a Human Resource<br />Building and Maintaining the Board-CEO Relationship<br />Developing Your Board's Structure and Performance Management Capacity<br />Involving Your Board in Leading Innovation<br />Involving Your Board in Operational Planning and Management in the External Area<br />Eadie then provides a &quot;Suggested Bibliography&quot; for those in need of additional information sources. The book is primarily intended for those who are members of what Eadie calls a &quot;strategic leadership team&quot; such as a governing board member, CEO, or senior manager.<br />As promised in the Preface, he provides practical, down-to-earth guidance that will help them build governing boards of directors and trustees that are extraordinary at doing their basic job: governing. Eadie acknowledges that his book is based on several &quot;critical assumptions&quot;: boards are organizations that can produce significant impact if they are systematically designed and developed; boards are above all else people; building extraordinary, high-impact boards is a team activity; and finally, the CEO should be the prime mover in developing a high-impact board. What Eadie provides is a comprehensive and cohesive guide. With regard to the aforementioned seven &quot;keys&quot; to extraordinary board leadership, they are: understanding in depth what governing is all about and generally how to develop a board's governing capacity; getting the right people to serve on the board and developing their governing skills; building and maintaining a strong board-CEO relationship; assembling a well-structured board which manages its own performance; having the board play a leading role in the organization's process for regularly generating significant innovation in an ever-changing, always-challenging environment; having the board play a strong, creative role in operational planning and budget preparation as well as operational oversight; and finally, having the board also play a creative role in external relations and financial resource development (i.e. fundraising). With eloquence and insight, Eadie explains HOW.<br />After many years of either serving on a governing board or reporting to one, I am convinced that this book will also be of substantial value to staff members who have little (if any) direct contact with governing board members. In an ideal world, everyone involved in an organization (top to bottom) should think and behave as if she or he were entrusted with the authority and responsibility which almost all governing board members now have. In a less-than-ideal world such as ours, the value of this book is even greater. You may also wish to check out &quot;What Business Can Learn from Nonprofits&quot;, one of the essays anthologized by Nan Stone in Peter Drucker on the Profession of Management. I also highly recommend Dan McCormick's Nonprofit Mergers which examines the power of successful partnerships and explains how such power can be developed and then leveraged.overning skills; building and maintaining a strong board-CEO relationship; assembling a well-structured board which manages its own performance; having the board play a leading role in the organization's process for regularly generating significant innovation in an ever-changing, always-challenging environment; having the board play a strong, creative role in operational planning and budget preparation as well as operational oversight; and finally, having the board also play a creative role in external relations and financial resource development (i.e. fundraising).

Regrettably, a majority of corporate mergers and acquisitions do not achieve the desired objectives. In this book, McCormick limits his attention to nonprofits, sharing many valuable lessons he learned from his involvement with various mergers such as divisions of the American Cancer Society. His approach to the subject is not from a legal perspective (\\"you can get a technical checklist from many competent law firms\\"); \\"it is not the contracts that make nonprofit organization (NPO) mergers work, it's the context. It's more about how it feels to the participants than how it is legally structured.\\" (We can only speculate how many more mergers of for-profits would succeed if the focus were on the human context rather than on the legal structure.) McCormick encourages his reader to think about a merger as a strategy to \\"increase capacity, advance mission, and ensure long-term viability.\\" He notes that NPOs which merge are beginning to \\"put pressure on small organizations and gradually out-compete them for volunteers, donors, media attention, advocacy, and impact on their cause.\\" Moreover, mergers \\"produce the capital and capacity for inventiveness. Mergers take competition through cooperation to what I call `co-operation.' a nonprofit corporate structure that competes better just because of the way it is organized.&quot;<br />The word \\"mergers\\" is in the title but the word \\"partnerships\\" is in the subtitle and I think much of this book's substantial value is found in what McCormick has to say about partnerships or, if you prefer, strategic alliances. Great benefit can also be derived from the process of determining whether or not to merge with a given candidate. Due diligence may perhaps reveal more information about your own organization than it does about a given candidate. McCormick  organizes his material within nine chapters:<br />Deciding to Merge<br />Selecting a Merger Partner<br />Laying the Groundwork with Staff and Volunteers<br />Negotiating and Determining Structure<br />Dissolution vs. Merger<br />Technical and Legal Aspects<br />Working with Consultants and Attorneys<br />Transition to Merge<br />Evaluation and Stewardship<br />After his Conclusion, McCormick provides 12 appendices which include relevant case histories, informative sample documents, and practical checklists. Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book? Obviously, governing board members as well as senior-level executives in an NPO which is an active merger candidate, either to acquire or be acquired. I also highly recommend this book to governing board members and senior-level executives of all other NPOs which could soon become involved (voluntarily or involuntarily) in merger negotiations or at least in preliminary discussions.<br />At this point,  I presume to offer a suggestion to decision-makers in any NPO: Schedule a 2-3 day off-site workshop and require all participants to read this book in advance. Use its \\"Table of Contents\\" for the agenda. The group's objective is to collaborate on a Game Plan (if an active merger candidate) or a Contingency Plan (\\"just in case\\"). Here is how McCormick concludes: \\"There is an old saying that `ships are safe in port, but that is not why they are built.' Merger is a time for leadership to set sail and captain the organization to a new land. A land of opportunity is made available by the increased capacity of merger with a dynamic partner.\\" To which I add, Bon Chance!

Virtual teams and networks -- effective, value-based, swiftly reconfiguring, cost-sensitive, and decentralized -- will profoundly reshape our shared world. As members of many virtual groups, we will contribute to these ephemeral webs of relationships that together weave our future.\\" That day is already here for many people and I agree that virtual working relationships will soon be the rule rather than the exception. The authors correctly note that technology extends capabilities \\"but organizing to do things together is only human. The most profound change of the new millennium is in the way we're organized.\\" Moreover, as more people connect online, \\"we increase our capacity for both independence and interdependence. Competition and cooperation both thrive in our new culture.\\" However, there are perils to avoid because whatever goes wrong with in-the-same place teams can also go wrong with virtual teams -- only worse and, worse yet, faster and at a much greater cost.<br />The authors organize their excellent material within 14 chapters whose individual titles indicate each chapter's perspective on virtual teams: Why,  Networks, Teams, Trust, Place, Time, Purpose, people, Links, Launch, Navigate, Theory, Think, and Future. I agree that a virtual team \\"is a group of people who work interdependently with a shared purpose across space, time, and organization boundaries.\\" Nonetheless, I still have some quibbles about the authors' sequence of subject matter (not with the content itself) and am still convinced that cooperation between and among members of virtual teams is even more difficult than it is between and among those within physical boundaries. Moreover, my own rather extensive experience with all manner of corporate clients suggests that the most formidable barriers are between two ears. If you have some serious human barriers in your own organization, I urge you to check out O'Dell and Grayson's immensely thoughtful and practical book, If Only We Knew What We Know.<br />But please keep in mind that even if O'Dell, Grayson, Lipnack, and Stamps were retained to create virtual teams for your organization, unless and until everyone else involved buys into the enterprise, the results would be abysmal. Hence the importance of several points which Lipnack and Stamps make in the final chapter, notably the absolutely essential need for trust. \\"A presumption of trust enables a successful strategy of collaboration [enables everyone involved] to be better innovators, competitors, and survivors....If purpose is the glue, trust is the grease.\\" I agree.<br />Of course, no single volume such as this can provide all the right answers but Lipnack and Stamps raise most (if not all) of the most important questions. Their answers seem sensible and practical. Of course, decision-makers must decide what the nature, extent, and duration of a virtual relationship should be in their organization at any given time. The authors do provide an excellent source of information and insight which can help virtually (pun intended) any organization increase cooperation and collaboration across boundaries through the effective use of various technologies. Especially, in this age of accelerating globalization, most organizations need all the help they can get.I urge you to check out O'Dell and Grayson's immensely thoughtful and practical book, If Only We Knew What We Know. <br />But please keep in mind that even if O'Dell, Grayson, Lipnack, and Stamps were retained to create virtual teams for your organization, unless and until everyone else involved buys into the enterprise, the results would be abysmal.

The title refers to his assertion that the success of \\"60 Minutes\\" is explained by the fact that \\"the most talented men and women in the broadcast news business\\" formulate and then execute ideas which tell an interesting story. \\"It's that easy.\\" It's also that difficult. This is what I call a \\"tag along book\\" in that Hewitt allows his readers to accompany him over a period of 50 years during which he has produced news broadcasts, the Nixon-Kennedy debates, national political conventions, and of course \\"Sixty Minutes.\\" He shares his frank opinions of various associates such as Lowell Bergman, Ed Bradley, Walter Cronkite, Fred Friendly, Edward R. Murrow, William S. Paley, Dan Rather, Harry Reasoner, Andy Rooney, Morley Safer, Diane Sawyer, Laurence Tisch, and Mike Wallace. He also comments on various American Presidents, competitors in the broadcast news industry, professional athletes, and show business celebrities. What I found most entertaining is Hewitt's no-nonsense attitude. He can be irreverent, playful, self-deprecating, egotistical, outraged, embarassed, and amusing...but never dull and always good company. Hewitt provides all manner of behind-the-scenes revelations which are always good fun. He can also be thoughtful, at times prescient when commenting on both the glories and inadequacies of broadcast news. He devotes substantial attention to his own misjudgments over the years. He also offers specific suggestions as to how broadcast news can be improved. For me, the book's conclusion reveals why the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of this 78-year old pioneer/iconoclast are worth sharing. \\"One morning, Darryl Kemp, who mans the front desk at 60 Minutes, greeted me with `Mr. Hewitt, when I grow up, I want to be just like you.' And I said, `That's funny. So do I.'\\" Let's all hope he never does.es.	2001-04-03

However, I know what I do not know and think it is naive to claim that, over time, almost anyone (once having read this book) can consistently  \\"beat the market\\" while beating the pros \\"at their own game.\\" In the Foreword, Frank Petrilli (president &amp; COO of TD Waterhouse) notes that Warwick presents \\"a plethora of easy-to-execute strategies the individual investor can use to outperform the investment management professionals.\\" Part one presents a range of strategies for trading individual stocks. In Part Two, Warwick shifts his attention to index trading with exchange-traded funds, \\"offering insight into how to profit handsomely by trading broad market indexes instead of individual stocks.\\" Then on to Part Three in which Warwick explains how to use the Internet to build a portfolio that \\"mimics -- and in many cases surpasses -- the performance of any stock index. In Part Four, Warwick provides a thorough guide to selecting mutual funs as well as an \\"incisive overview of the market timing strategies most frequently used by mutual fund and exchange-traded fund investors.\\" All true.<br />I have no quarrel with any of Warwick's advice. As have countless others, he stresses the importance of setting specific investment goals, formulating a plan to achieve them, know what your limits are (e.g. \\"risk/return tolerance boundary&quot;), stay disciplined, \\"Remember your partner\\" (i.e. Uncle Sam, \\"the only rich uncle who never dies\\"), monitor developments rationally rather than \\"falling in love\\" with either a company or a stock, and finally, \\"Always Do Your Homework!\\" What Warwick offers is a primer. Viewed as such, I rate it higher than have others. As indicated, insofar as Warwick limits his attention to quantitative strategies, he seems to be on solid ground. However, as Don Mitchell correctly observes in his own Customer Review, Warwick errs when asserting that amateur and even semi-pro investors will outperform the indexes using the same strategies. My own advice to most of those who read this Customer Review of mine is the same as Warwick's: \\"Always Do Your Homework!\\" Specifically, read this and several other books which offer both information and advice.

It is far easier to achieve success than to sustain it. Given the increasingly greater impact of the Web, the necessity of connectivity and interactivity rapidly increases. Finally, mastery of what Senge calls \\"the fifth discipline\\" of organization-wide learning may well determine whether or not excellence can be sustained in the face of constant, at times traumatic change.<br />In the Preface, Berge shares what he refers to as \\"some patterns and commonalities\\" which he has noted over the years while reviewing hundreds of cases involving distance training and educational technology. He has assembled and edited a collection 20 brilliant essays which are distributed within five Parts: Introduction, Meeting the Challenge of Uncommon Organizational Change, Setting Competitive Standards, Achieving organizational Goals, and Summary. He then provides an Appendix (Case Study Research Methodology Used for This Book, Glossary, and References. In the Preface, Berge explains that the purpose of this book is to \\"disseminate a plausible model or framework for sustaining distance training and to describe the essential elements in the model with multiple cases to illustrate and help the reader's understanding.\\" His primary audience consists of organizational managers, performance consulting professionals, and practitioners charged with the training functions in corporations, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies.<br />Berge is the author of the first two essays which comprise Part One: \\"The Context of Distance Training: Predicting Change\\" and \\"A Framework for Sustaining Distance Training.\\" Berge does indeed offer a \\"model\\" and a \\"framework\\" (rather than a definitive operations manual) whose purpose is to assist virtually any organization as it  formulates whichever structure, policies, procedures, strategies, and tactics are most appropriate to its own specific needs and interests.<br />Throughout this exceptionally informative book, various authorities share their own experiences with sustaining distance training. For example, Ellsworth and Iorizzo discuss \\"Distance Training at the U.S. Army Intelligence Center: Surviving Implementation.\\" Other essays examine initiatives in a wide range of other organizations such as SBC, the U.S. General Accounting Office, the IRS, the UAW-Daimler/Chrysler National Training Center, Ford Motor Company (dealerships), Nortel Networks, Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young, the U.S. Postal Service, and the American Red Cross. Although the organizations are huge, thye various essays' authors have convinced me that literally ANY organization not only can but must -- to varying degrees -- establish and then sustain effective distance training programs, ones which would involve their employees (of course) but could also involve the employees of business partners, vendors, service providers, federal and state regulatory agencies, and perhaps even competitors. (Frankly, I am no longer surprised when historical competitors -- &quot;enemies&quot; -- forge mutually beneficial strategic alliances. In recent years, I have played a role in helping to consummate quite a few. \\"I never thought I'd live to see the day when....\\") All by itself, the Appendix is well worth the cost of this book.  In it, Berge explains the methodology used for his book. For some  it may be advisable to read the Preface and the Appendix before proceeding through the 20 essays. In any event, this is a first-rate piece of work.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Berge's previously published Distance Training as well as Senge's The Fifth Discipline and The Dance of Change, Isaacs' Dialogue, and O'Dell and Grayson's If Only We Knew What We know.nd interests.  <br />Throughout this exceptionally informative book, various authorities share their own experiences with sustaining distance training.

In process, he examines Lewis' relationship with Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States. Ambrose quotes Henry Adams who described the American of 1801: \\"Stripped for the hardest work, every muscle firm and elastic, every ounce of brain ready for use, and not a trace of superfluous flesh on his nervous and supple body, the American stood in the world a new order of man.\\" Ambrose adds, \\"he could have been describing Meriwether Lewis.\\" Only men such as Lewis could lead a voyage up the Missouri River to the Rockies, then continue the expedition over the mountains, down the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean, and eventually return home to Washington (DC). This was a journey worthy of Homer's Odysseus. It is important to keep in mind that Jefferson set quite specific objectives for Lewis to achieve, including the creation of a number of maps of territories (e.g. Oregon, Washington, and Idaho) which the new nation would later claim for itself.<br />Lewis is best understood as a scientist, not as an adventurer. In his detailed records he describes native peoples, wildlife, flora and fauna, weather, landscape, science...indeed virtually everything and everyone he encountered throughout the expedition. We also learn a great deal about his partner, William Clark, and Sacagawea, an Indian maiden who accompanied them. In fact, we learn a great deal about the entire social, political, economic, and scientific \\"world\\" at that time which was in turbulent transition. Lewis viewed his expedition as a failure because it did not reveal an all-water route to the Pacific. (There was none.) Also, contrary to Jefferson's hopes, most of the Great Plains obtained by the Louisiana Purchase were unsuitable for farming and there was no river flowing down from Canada into the Missouri. Fulfillment of Jefferson's Grand Vision was thus denied...or so Lewis thought. Throughout his adventures, Lewis' courage was indeed undaunted. However, although a national hero after having completed the expedition, he was unable to cope with various problems and died an ignominious death.

Van Dulken selects and discusses \\"100 inventions that shaped the world\\", organizing his material within ten chapters to correspond with the ten decades of the 20th century:<br />1900-1910 (e.g. aeroplane, air conditioning, and the vacuum cleaner)<br />1910-1919 (e.g. Formica®, neon lighting, and the self-service supermarket<br />1920-1929 (e.g.  the bread slicing machine, power steering, and television<br />1930-1939 (e.g. the jet engine, the photocopier, and radar<br />1940-1949 (e.g. the ballpoint pen, the computer, and the transistor<br />1950-1959 (e.g. the geodesic dome, the microchip, and Velcro® fasteners)<br />1960-1969 (e.g. implantable pacemaker, the mouse, and the Workmate® workbench) 1970-1979 (e.g. the artificial heart, Post-it® notes, and the smart card)<br />1980-1989 (e.g. cellular phones, genetic fingerprinting, and the video game)<br />1990-1999 (e.g. cloning animals, fuel cells, and programmable materials)<br />Van Dulken discusses ten different inventions in each of the ten chapters, providing detailed descriptions as well as explanations of the historical context in which each was devised and by whom. In the Introduction by Andrew Phillips, the reader is told that the inventions highlighted in this book \\"have benefitted people of virtually every nation. Some have helped combat the despair of disease, poverty, excessive (even unendurable) labour. Other inventions -- though less illustrated by this book --have contributed to the ravages of war. What comes forth so often, however, from the examples described here is the individuality and initiative which characterizes so many inventors who helped change the world between 1900 and 1999.\\" Quite true.

2066963:US	51147790	R2CRA7QCPPCJHQ	0812929233	442033764	Real Change Leaders: How You Can Create Growth and High Performance at Your Company	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Invaluable Guidance to Prudent Growth and Real Achievement	There are several reasons why I think this is one of the most important business books I have read in recent years. Here are three. First, it is the best single-source I have as yet encountered which prescribes and explains a cohesive program by which create growth and high performance in an organization. Also, this program allows for all manner of adjustments and modifications to accommodate the specific, sometimes unique needs and interests of any organization. Finally, it is extraordinarily well-written. In fact, this edition combines two books in one volume because the original version has since been expanded to include \\"The RCL's Handbook for Action.\\"<br />To gather the information they needed, Katzenbach and his associates at McKinsey &amp; Company (the \\"RCL Team\\") examined more than 30 different change situations and interviewed more than 150 change leaders. In the Introduction, they discuss seven common characteristics among the RCLs and then cite three shared beliefs:<br />1. \\"Tough standards of performance, but not just financial performance; customer value and workforce rewards are important as well.<br />2. \\"A set of democratic principles that tap the creative power inherent in every  person; but they also enforce consequence management, believing they  can truly empower people only by requiring results in return.<br />3. \\"The essence of self-governance is joint accountability (among leaders and  constituents alike) for creating new opportunity; the basic approach is  open dialogue and interaction  to resolve conflicts by working to obtain  the best contributions from multiple points of view.\\"<br />The material is organized within three Parts: People-Intensive Change, Engaging the Organization, and Leadership Capacity and Growth. Throughout the book, the reader is provided with immensely informative as well as convenient charts (eg \\"Differences Between `Good Managers' and RCLs) which feature key points. I have already noted \\"The Real Change Leader's Handbook for Action\\" (pages 341-391 in the softbound edition) which, in effect, gives each reader a template as well as a frame-of-reference to implement whichever combination of concepts, strategics, and tactics is most appropriate. The \\"Handbook\\" offers comments, suggestions, checklists and frameworks \\"for getting started in areas where change leadership help is needed.\\"<br />For me, one of the book's greatest values is derived from its response to the question, \\"What distinguishes a real change leader from traditional managers?\\" The answer may in some ways surprise you, as it did me. For example, \\"Real change leaders do not care if the change effort is fast or slow, empowered or controlled, one-time or recurring, cultural or engineered -- or all of the above. They only care that it is people-intensive, and performance oriented....Simply put, real change leaders learn how to survive and win in the delta state, while traditional managers can only survive in the current state or the future state.\\"  The real change leader is committed to delivering results beyond the bottom line and instilling a working vision in the hearts and minds of associates while doing whatever is the right thing to do. They help others to perform above expectations (especially their own), constantly nourishing relations with customers while developing and applying the skills needed to remain flexible. Over time, they achieve results with a no-excuses mindset.<br />If you share my high regard for this book, I urge you to check out O'Toole's Leading Change and Hamel's Leading the Revolution as well as Buckingham and Coffman's First, Break All the Rules.Handbook for Action\\" (pages 341-391 in the softbound edition) which, in effect, gives each reader a template as well as a frame-of-reference to implement whichever combination of concepts, strategics, and tactics is most appropriate.

In the Foreword, Frederick W. Smith (chairman and CEO of FedEx) suggests that \\"Successful leaders of the future will have to tap into the tremendous potential passion offers them. In fact, despite the advances in both physical networks and information networks, that drive the high-tech and high-speed New Economy, successful leaders must invest in a third and vital network -- a passionate people network that sparks the ideas and innovation for lasting success.\\" In his previous work (The Passion Plan), Chang offers a step-by-step process by which an individual can discover, develop, and live the passion to which Smith refers. In this volume, Chang shifts his attention to what Smith characterizes as a \\"passionate people network\\", explaining how each and every person involved in an organization \\"has the potential to strengthen and improve performance. And when passion is involved the possibility that the changes will spread increases exponentially.\\" Human history is filled with countless examples of passionate people who inspired others to join then in achieving seemingly impossible goals. In today's business world, according to Collins and Porras In Built to Last, they could be called Big Hairy Audacious Goals (BHAGs). Point is, without a passionate commitment by those involved, achieving lasting and significant change is highly unlikely.<br />Chang organizes his material within ten chapters whose titles correctly indicate the step-by-step process:<br />Why Passion Works in Organizations: A Timely Source for Timely Change<br />Putting the Passion Plan to Work: A Model for Organizational Success<br />Step One: Start from the Heart -- Passion as the Foundation of the Organization's Success<br />Step Two: Discover Core Passions -- Uncovering the Forces That Will Drive the Organization's Success<br />Step Three: Clarify Purpose -- Channeling the Organization's Passion Toward a Specific Goal<br />Step Four: Define Actions -- Planning for Passion-Inspired Change and Growth<br />Step Five: Perform with Passion -- Translating Passion into Performance in the Workplace and Marketplace<br />Step Six: Spread Excitement -- Sparking Commitment and Enthusiasm in Employees, Partners, and Customers<br />Step Seven: Stay the Course -- Keeping the Organization Centered on Passion<br />Realizing Profit: Moving on to Bigger and Better Things<br />Chang then includes an excellent resource, \\"Profiled Organizations\\", which consists of Web sites of various \\"superior organizations\\" which range from Ben &amp; Jerry's to Wainwright Industries. I rate this book so highly because its coverage of material is eloquent, practical, comprehensive, and cohesive. It remains for each organization (regardless of its size or nature) to select, combine, modify, and then apply Chang's key ideas. Those who share my admiration of this book are urged to check out the aforementioned Built to Last as well as Real Change Leaders (Katzenbach and the RCL Team) and The Irresistible Growth Enterprise (Mitchell, Coles &amp; Kahn).

It locates an unexpected source of boundless energy to bring these changes into being\\" and then assert that \\"if we want deeper understanding of the prospect of change, we must pay closer attention to our own powerful inclinations not [italics] to change. This attention may help us discover within ourselves the force and beauty of a hidden immune system, the dynamic process by which we tend to prevent change, by which we manufacture continuously the antigens of change.\\" I am convinced that most human limits are self-imposed...that in Pogo's words, \\"We have met the enemy and he is us.\\" The authors do indeed focus on what they call \\"an unexpected source of boundless energy\\" which significant change requires.<br />Throughout the book, they examine what they call \\"Seven Languages for Transformation\\" and suggest how to gain fluency in each. Four are Internal Languages: Commitment, Personal Responsibility, Competing Commitments (\\"Diagnosing the Immunity to Change\\"), and Assumptions We Hold (\\"Disturbing the Immunity to Change\\"). Fluency in these four enables us to build \\"The New Machine.\\" There are also three Social Languages: Ongoing Regard, Public Agreement, and Deconstructive Criticism. Fluency in these three enables us to maintain and upgrade \\"The New Machine.\\"<br />It is important to keep in mind that we communicate with others as well as with ourselves in three primary ways: body language, tone of voice, and content (ie what we verbalize). Decades of scientific research reveals that, in face-to-face contact, body language has the greatest impact, followed (at a significant distance) by tone of voice and then content. In voice-to-voice contact (eg during a telephone conversation), tone of voice has perhaps three times greater impact than does what is verbalized. I mention all this by way of suggesting that HOW we communicate with others and (especially) with ourselves has a major impact on behavior. Hence the importance of replacing a negative attitude. with a positive attitude. For example, to replace the Language of Complaint with the Language of Commitment.<br />What the authors provide is a cohesive and comprehensive process by which to recognize, understand, and then eliminate various barriers to personal and then to organizational change. In recent years, organizations throughout the world have invested hundreds of millions (billions?) of dollars in the improvement of systems of various kinds. What is sometimes overlooked or at least underestimated (at great cost in terms of hours as well as dollars) are the negative attitudes of those involved in change initiatives. Kegan and Lahey eloquently and convincingly suggest specific strategies to transform those attitudes through fluency in seven \\"languages\\" within the curriculum of what they view as a \\"new technology\\" of learning.

Lipnack and Stamps organize their excellent material within two Sections and then provide an Afterword (\\"The Risk of Democracy: Teamnets as the Hope for the 21st Century\\") and a Reference Section (\\"Transforming Bureaucracies and Systems\\"). The authors assert that teamnets create the \\"great competitive advantage of boundary crossing\\" and I agree. They identify \\"Five Teamnet Principles\\" (unifying purpose, independent members, voluntary links, multiple leaders, and interactive levels), explaining precisely how these principles shape and inform teamnetting initiatives. What I found especially interesting and informative are their analyses of various organizations which have created and sustained successful teamnets.<br />I want to stress two points when highly recommending this book. First, it was valuable in 1993 when first published but is even more valuable now because of all of the opportunities which the WWW continues to create. Eventually all organizations will be directly or indirectly involved in globalization, for example. The \\"Five Teamnet Principles\\" will continue to create almost unlimited potential applications. Also, with all due respect to major international corporations such as those the authors examine, I think their observations and suggestions will be of even greater value to small-to-midsize organizations in which teamwork and connectivity are not only desirable but indeed imperative.	2001-03-07

It is also worth noting that the school, college, and professional teams Lombardi coached were also renowned for other qualities such as tenacity, discipline, commitment, self-sacrifice, mastery of basic skills, and -- above all else -- teamwork. Bucciarelli explains that \\"Much of the material presented in this book is modeled after the Leadership Assessment and Development Program used by the United States Army. This program was developed through research and leadership experiences collected over the past thirty years.\\"<br />The material is organized as follows:<br />Leadership Defined<br />Leadership Foundation<br />Confidence<br />Leadership Self-Assessment<br />Leadership Building Blocks [there are 17, ranging from Oral Communications to Followership]<br />Leadership Style<br />Leadership Ethics<br />Leadership Development<br />Bucciarelli then provides a References section which suggests a wealth of additional resources for those in need of them. If leaders are not born but can be made, HOW? Bucciarelli (and presumably Lombardi) would reply: \\"block\\" by \\"block.\\" After completing what amounts to a 17-step process, will anyone become a leader? Of course not but, at least theoretically, anyone can. As with the process by which Lombardi prepared his players for another season, the process which Bucciarelli proposes will determine who will measure up...and who will not.<br />Bucciarelli draws heavily upon the wisdom and experience of other experts on the subject of leadership (e.g. Bennis, Blanchard, Covey, Drucker, Kohlberg, O'Toole, Peters, Sun Tzu, and Waitley), quoting key points from their works within  an appropriate context. He also includes a series of rigorous self-assessment exercises which, all by themselves, are worth the cost of this book. Throughout, he urges his reader to \\"build on your life experiences a strong foundation of skills to confidently lead the members of your group to success in any endeavor you choose to pursue.\\" Everything Bucciarelli advocates is wholly consistent with the principles endorsed by history's greatest religious, political, military, and intellectual leaders. As I read this book, I was reminded of several coaching clinics I attended in years past. The featured speakers included Lombardi, Wooden, Paterno, Knight, McKay, Auerbach, Holtz, Shula, and Valvano. Each in his own words emphasized the great importance of preparation, dedication, personal integrity, and determination.<br />Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book? I especially recommend it to college and university students now studying business. Also, to those who have recently embarked on a business career or have reached the middle-management level. But I do not exclude executives at the highest organizational levels. No doubt much (if not most) of what Bucciarelli covers is familiar to them.

You can thus understand why I was curious to know to what extent (if any) Six Sigma could be helpful to small-to-midsize companies.<br />By now we have become well aware of the success of Six Sigma initiatives at major international corporations such as ABB, Allied Signal/Honeywell, Black &amp; Decker, Dow Chemical, Dupont, Federal Express, General Electric, Johnson and Johnson, Kodak, Motorola, SONY, and Toshiba. Once having read this book, I am convinced that -- with certain modifications -- Six Sigma could perhaps be even more valuable to small-to-midsize companies which, obviously, have fewer resources. What exactly is Six Sigma? The authors provide this definition: \\"A comprehensive and flexible system for achieving, sustaining, and maximizing business success. Six Sigma is uniquely driven by close understanding of consumer needs, disciplined use of facts, data, and statistical analysis, and diligent attention to managing, improving, and reinventing business processes.\\"<br />The authors identify what they call \\"hidden truths\\" about Six Sigma:<br />1. You can apply Six Sigma to many different business activities and challenges -- from strategic planning to operations to customer service -- and maximize the impact of your efforts.<br />2. The benefits of Six Sigma will be accessible whether you lead an entire organization or a department. Moreover, you'll be able to scale your efforts, from tackling specific problems to renewing the entire business.<br />3. You'll be prepared to achieve breakthroughs in these untapped gold mines of opportunity -- and to broaden Six Sigma beyond the realm of the engineering community.<br />4. You'll gain insights into how to strike the balance between push and pull -- accommodating people and demanding performance. That balance is where real sustained improvement is found. On either side -- being \\"too nice\\" or forcing people beyond their understanding and readiness -- lie merely short-term goals or no results at all.<br />5.  The good news is, Six Sigma is a lot more fun than root canal. Seriously, the significant financial gains from Six Sigma may be exceeded in value by the intangible benefits. In fact, the changes in attitude and enthusiasm that come from improved processes and better-informed people are often easier to observe, and more emotionally rewarding than dollar savings.<br />The authors organize their material as follows: Part One: An Executive Summary of Six Sigma; Part Two: Gearing Up and Adapting Six Sigma to Your Organization; Part Three: Implementing Six Sigma -- The Roadmap and Tools; and finally, The Appendices: Practical Support. According to Jack Welch, \\"The best Six Sigma projects begin not inside the business but outside it, focused on answering the question -- how can we make the customer more competitive? What is critical to the customer's success?...One thing we have discovered with certainty is that anything we do that makes the customer more successful inevitably results in a financial return for us.\\"<br />If anything, it is even more important for small-to-midsize companies (than it is for the GEs of the world) to answer these two questions correctly and then track and compare their performance in terms of what their customers require. The well-publicized objective of Six Sigma is to achieve practically-perfect quality of performance (ie 3.4 defects for every million activities or \\"opportunities\\") and this is indeed an ambitious objective. Collins and Porras, authors of Built to Last, would probably view it as the biggest of Big Hairy Audacious Goals (BHAGs).  In that book, they assert that the most successful and admired companies have the ability -- and willingness -- to simultaneously adopt two seemingly contrary objectives at the same time. Stability and renewal, Big Picture and minute detail, creativity and rational analysis -- these forces, working together,, make organizations great. This \\"we can do it all\\" approach they call the \\"Genius of the And.\\"<br />Pande, Neuman, and Cavanagh suggest that all manner of specific benefits can result from following \\"the Six Sigma way.\\" For example, Six Sigma generates sustained success, sets a performance goal for everyone, enhances value to customers, accelerates the rate of improvement, promotes learning and \\"cross-pollination\\", and executes strategic change. All organizations (regardless of their size or nature) need to avoid or escape what the authors refer to as the \\"Tyranny of Or.\\" Here in a single volume is about all they need to seek \\"practically-perfect quality of performance.\\" Whether or not they ultimately reach that destination, their journey en route is certain to achieve improvement which would otherwise not be possible.-- and willingness -- to simultaneously adopt two seemingly contrary objectives at the same time.

In effect, the reader is given direct access to the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of persons who may otherwise be inaccessible. McMeekin interviewed 45 \\"highly creative women\\" whose responses reveal 12 \\"secrets\\" which, in fact, are affirmations of basic values which most of us have been encouraged to embrace by caring parents and other relatives, teachers, coaches, clergy, etc. My own opinion is that these same values would also be affirmed by highly creative men.<br />McMeekin organizes her material within a series of three &quot;Gateways&quot; (ie rights of passage): Engaging Your Creativity, Mastering Your Challenges as a Creative Woman, and Actualizing Creative Results: The Power of Positive Priorities. She suggests that certain lessons can be learned from \\"a myriad of practices called Challenges.\\"  It takes courage (sometimes great courage) to confront such challenges. Hence the importance of the \\"lessons.\\" McMeekin suggests that a \\"fabulous notebook, a gorgeous notebook\\" be purchased in which to record responses to all of the Challenges included in her book. She further suggests that the 12 Secrets be applied during each week or each month of the year.<br />Prior to reading a book, it is my standard procedure first to check out its title and subtitle, its Table of Contents, and then its Introduction or Preface. Frankly, I had some apprehensions after doing so with this book. How does McMeekin define \\"creative\\"? Written for and about women, will the book have any relevance to me and other males? Also frankly, by now I have become skeptical (if not cynical) about references to \\"secrets.\\" Nonetheless, I began to read her \\"Note to the Reader\\" and then the 12 chapters which follow. Those interviewed provide a diverse and abundant range of personal experiences which both suggest and corroborate McMeekin's key points. Now having read the book, I can add affirmation of my own: This is one of the most thoughtful and thought-provoking books on human fulfillment which I have read in recent years. Who will derive the great benefit from it?  My response is: Those (regardless of their gender and circumstance) who are accessible to what the 45 \\"highly creative women\\" were willing to share, those who possess the courage to take on the Challenges, and finally, those who are both willing and able to learn from the Secrets and then apply the Lessons.<br />Centuries ago, John Bunyan's Pilgrim embarked on a perilous journey. He was sustained by his faith and eventually prevailed. McMeekin seems to be suggesting that, in our own time, an equally perilous journey must be made.  There are Gateways through which we must pass, meanwhile overcoming various Challenges. The 45 women whom McMeekin interviewed (most of them  unfamiliar to me) were \\"highly creative\\" during their own personal and perilous journeys. They are modern-day Pilgrims who prevailed. McMeekin seems totally convinced that each of her readers can do so also if having the same faith and the same courage. I agree. If you share my high regard for this book, I urge you to check out Ellie Wymard's Conversations with Uncommon Women. Obvious to me, both she and McMeekin are uncommon human beings.points.

Books	5	3	3	N	N	Collaboration with Appropriate Velocity	The hybrid title obviously fuses two very important words: \\"fast\\" and \\"alliance.\\" It is Segil's assertion (and I totally agree) that \\"The e-commerce business world has turned many old rules on their heads....You have to be ahead of the [other] players in this game. FastAlliances can be the tool -- the approach that helps you reinvent a small part of your organizational structure if you are a traditional (not new Internet) company. If you are a new Internet company, the challenge will be to apply some level of discipline while maintaining the velocity you have already created.\\" So the emphasis for all organizations (regardless of size or nature, be it a \\"traditional\\" or \\"new Internet\\" organization) must be on forging and sustaining appropriate strategic alliances while conducting business at a high rate of speed. How? Segil offers a \\"unique model\\" which suggests a seven-step approach:<br />1. Diagnosis of Your Company, Competitors, and Industry<br />2. The Up-Front Work in the Creation of FastAlliances<br />3.  Define the Deliverables for FastAlliances<br />4. Managing Stakeholder Expectations<br />5. The Essential Characteristics for Business Development<br />6. Leveraging the Global E-Space<br />7. Employing the E-Mindshift System<br />Actually, there is a Step 8: The Deals -- Making, Managing, Adding Value, and Terminating Them.  She explains the \\"nitty-gritty of creating and managing FastAlliances -- metrics, ongoing change mechanisms, and knowledge transfer; tools, tools, tools!\\"  There is a separate chapter devoted to each Step, followed by a final chapter (Chapter 9) in which she discusses \\"Pitfalls and Opportunities -- Summing Up.\\" This is an especially valuable chapter because Segil addresses a key issue: How to grow a company in e-space by using traditional alliances along with FastAlliances.<br />In the Afterword, Segil provides her e-mail address, inviting readers to visit her website and thereby gain access to a suite of more than 25 software processes that comprise the Larraine Segil Partner Relationship Management (PRM) System. She also provides her e-mail address with the expressed hope for a continuing relationship with her readers. In other words, Segil continues to seek out FastAlliances of her own which perhaps (just perhaps) may include one with you. I also direct your attention to two appendices: FastAlliance Toolkit and Companies Supplying Weapons and Countermeasures in the War for Web Customers.<br />I rate this book so highly because its material is substantial and logically organized, because it is very well-written, and because (as Segil herself would no doubt agree) the book enables, indeed encourages each reader to select a combination of concepts, strategies, and tactics which is most appropriate to her or his own organization. Yes, to some extent, this is a \\"How to\\" book but it is also a \\"Why to\\" book.  The seven-step or, for some, eight-step process allows for all manner of modifications to accommodate (a) the unique needs and interests of each organization and (b) changes in that organization's circumstances (eg leadership, resources, or competitive environment).  Of course, the value of this book will be determined by the nature and extent of needs to which its ideas are applied, and, the skill with which such application is made. Now more than ever before, organizations need all the friends they can make...and then keep. Segil suggests a practical and comprehensive process to achieve that objective. Now more than ever before, organizations must also be able to maintain the velocity necessary to compete successfully. Segil also addresses that need.

As he explains in the Introduction, \\"What you're going to find in the pages of this book is a guide that's designed to help you navigate through the maze of issues that surround this whole business of using technology to enhance your sales and marketing efforts. It's going to help you match your technology initiatives with the wants and needs of your customers. \\" he also promises (and delivers) specific strategies and tactics to understand so as to cope with \\"the dynamics of a changing marketplace\\" to be at the cutting edge, and, in process he provides essential insights into the possibilities of e-business so as not to miss any significant but appropriate opportunities. The word \\"appropriate\\" is critically important. Colombo correctly realizes that it would be folly to attempt to be all things to all customers and prospective customers. He organizes the material within three Sections:<br />Moving Beyond the Limitations of \\"Web Centricity\\" (Chapters 1-4)<br />An Unstoppable Arsenal of Winning Strategies and Tactics (Chapters 5-10)<br />Fine Tuning Your Formula for Success in the Wired World (Chapters 11-14)<br />At the end of most chapters, Colombo includes a \\"Capturing Conversations\\" component which is a probing interview of a relevant authority (eg Seth Godin) on the key issues previously addressed. Jeffrey Gitomer and others have stressed the importance of customer \\"loyalty\\" (ie sustainable repeat business) as opposed to customer \\"satisfaction\\" which is experienced on a per-transaction basis. Colombo shares that view. The ultimate objective is not to \\"capture\\" customers but to KEEP them. In this well-written book, he explains how. Here is a brief excerpt from the concluding chapter: \\"In the grand scheme of things, the technology piece of the puzzle is relatively easy. There is plenty of talent out there to help you get where you want to go. The hard part is knowing where to go. The hard part is understanding what your market wants. [Note: Some customers may often seem fickle or disloyal when, in fact, their needs have changed. Hence the importance of what Treacy and Wiersema characterize as `the discipline of customer intimacy.'] The hard part is understanding what motivates your customers. Serving the needs and desires of your customers is the objective. Implementing technology is the vehicle that can get you there.\\" For many organizations regardless of their nature or size, Colombo would be an excellent chauffeur.is knowing where to go.

I had not previously heard of it. It was somewhat tough going, in part because I lacked understanding of an appropriate frame-of-reference within which to absorb and digest Schumpeter's ideas. Recently, I re-read it. To paraphrase Mark Twain, it is amazing how much Schumpeter has learned over the years. I strongly recommend that Tom Bottemore's excellent Introduction be read and then re-read at least once more before anyone proceeds into the Schumpeter text. It certainly would have been very helpful to my first reading. The 28 chapters are organized as follows:<br />Part I: The Marxian Doctrine<br />Part II: Can Capitalism Survive?<br />Part III: Can Socialism Work<br />Part IV: Socialism and Democracy<br />Part V: A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties<br />Obviously, the world which Schumpeter surveyed more than 50 years ago has undergone significant changes. (This book was first published in the US in 1942; a revised second edition appeared in 1957; and an expanded third edition appeared in 1950, the year in which he died.) Nonetheless, after a recent re-reading of the book, I am amazed at how stable its intellectual infrastructure remains. Bottomore explains the book's continuing appeal to readers \\"by the fact that it undertakes a serious and thorough examination of the great social transition of the present age, from capitalism to socialism, (and prefaces this with an illuminating critical appraisal of Marx's theory, as the only social analysis of the transition that merits attention) rather than by the kind of judgement  that it makes about the consequences of this process of social transformation.\\" Bottomore then quite correctly notes that, in this book, Schumpeter also examines \\"carefully and dispassionately\\" the difficulties and dangers presented by certain forms of socialism \\"which socialist thinkers themselves,,, after so many deceptions, can now more readily appreciate.\\" Granted, at least some of Bottomore's discussion of Schumpeter is itself dated. Nonetheless, Schumpeter's ideas are carefully developed; moreover, he explores all manner of connections between and among those with other ideas, including those he rejects.er so many deceptions, can now more readily appreciate.\\" Granted, at least some of Bottomore's discussion of Schumpeter is itself dated.

Initially, I was. In the first chapter, McGee explains his purposes when identifying what he calls \\"The Seven Signs of a Renaissance.\\" Obviously, the hybrid title fuses \\"technology\\" or \\"tech\\" with \\"renaissance\\" and the subtitle suggests McGee's optimism about the future which awaits his and others' children. This is a remarkably thoughtful and well-written commentary on a wide range of issues which two historical periods share in common, albeit 500 years apart. Specifically, those issues which concern Art, Globalization, the Human Potential Movement, Networks, The Pace of Change, Spiritual Awakening, and what Schumpeter has characterized as \\"Creative Destruction.\\" Perhaps McGee's optimism is explained, at least in part, because the two historical periods also share several values in common, notably curiosity, passion, tenacity, and courage. They can also be described (and explained) in terms of ferocious competition. \\"The last Renaissance still stands as one of history's Golden Ages. Nothing in the last 500 years quite compares in terms of progress in the arts, exploration, spirituality, politics, and economics.\\" That's true, at least until now. After years of research and reflection, McGee also concludes that \\"a renaissance can be a very dangerous thing. They are cataclysmic moments in our history, tearing down as much as they build up. My children and I were caught up in one of history's great social hurricanes. There was as much danger as there was promise in our future.\\"<br />McGee devotes a separate chapter to each of the seven \\"signs\\" and then in the final chapter, invoking the apt metaphor of a Hero's Journey, observes: \\"We have been collectively cast out of the ordinary world by technology. Whether we liked the old world better or not is irrelevant. The world has changed and we must make some form of peace with it....At the heart of the Hero's Journey is the centuries old belief that heroes make their own destiny. They cannot control the the circumstances which have changed their world, cannot predict what they will meet along the way, cannot even be certain that they will survive the innermost cave. But there is a point in every story -- the climax, to use modern storytelling terminology -- the crisis ordeal, to borrow from [Joseph] Campbell [in his classic study, The Hero with a Thousand Faces], in which the hero is faced with some decision and must choose or perish.\\"<br />I am reminded of the fact that the Chinese character for the word\\" crisis\\" has two meanings: peril; and opportunity. Which shall it be during the Technaissance? Who is equal to the challenge to be heroic? McGee offers several specific suggestions in his final chapter to those who are about to begin or have already begun their own \\"journey.\\" He reiterates what is by now, obviously, a strong conviction of his own: his hope is that \\"this book will contribute in a small way to improving the world which my children will someday inherit.\\" Then he suggests, \\"The only new Renaissance which matters is your own.\\" The Technaissance will proceed with or without us. The choice is ours. McGee is well aware of the perils involved even as he is sincerely optimistic about the possibilities available to all of us to help build &quot;the New World.\\"They cannot control the the circumstances which have changed their world, cannot predict what they will meet along the way, cannot even be certain that they will survive the innermost cave.

Popyk asserts that \\"Business cards are a start [toward developing a \\"golden database\\"]. Personal linking is what makes things happen. If there's no follow-through, nothing happens. That's what this book is really all about.\\" Frankly, until reading it, I really hadn't given sufficient consideration to the potential use of business cards. Of course, I already knew that they are (in Popyk's words) \\"people linkers\\" which can be used for \\"networking, schmoozing, connecting, reaching out, prospecting, selling, and basic advertising.\\" All of us already know that. The great value of Popyk's book is that it reveals all manner of other ways by which business cards can be uniquely and abundantly effective. He shares his observations and suggestions in 97 brief  but informative chapters which are organized within three Parts:<br />Networking Know-How and Business-Card Savvy<br />Personalized Presentations<br />Creative Design...It's All in the Cards<br />The book is exceptionally well-written. There is almost nothing hypothetical or theoretical about Popyk's suggestions. All of his key points are anchored in real-world situations. One of the major value-added benefits is the fact that, once you read his book and re-think your strategies while having someone re-design your business card, you begin to see how essentially the same principles can also be applied to marketing initiatives which create or increase demand for whatever you offer for sale. These same principles can also be of substantial value to the cultivation/solicitation process, especially when there is a lengthy sales cycle and the competition is ferocious. In such a competitive environment in which creating a &quot;circle of leverage&quot; is essential, the business card can be invaluable.<br />Individuals as well as organizations must constantly differentiate themselves from so many other options. Massive research reveals that, in face-to-face encounters, body language and tone of voice determine 75-80% of our impact, with what we actually say ranking a distant third in importance. A business card can do so much to reinforce positive first impressions. What it looks like and (yes) what it feels like are often more important than the information provided. Time and thought are required to ensure that the card is also appropriate. (Check out Chapter 95 in which Popyk identifies and discusses \\"The Best Cards to Go to for Examples.\\" ) With all due respect to positive first impressions (which certainly ARE important), then what? Will the material left behind be equally impressive? Will your card be indicative of your style, grace, class, etc.? It will indeed. If there is nothing distinctive about your card, chances are that that will be the \\"message\\" it conveys about you.<br />After reading this book, I had only one regret: That I had not read it before I ordered my first box of business cards many years ago. (I don't even want to think about all the other business cards I have since ordered for myself and my associates.) But to repeat, what Popyk shares has possible applications in virtually all areas of any business operation. Properly designed and produced, a business card can be a \\"miniature billboard\\" on display wherever an organization's employees go. (All employees in every organization should have a business card. All of them.) That same card can also be a constant reminder to those employees of  their organization's positive values. The cost of a properly designed and produced business card is relatively insignificant. How about the cost of a cheesy business card?

These principles provide entrepreneurs \\"guidance and safe passage as they navigate their way through the tight straits of the economy and successfully dock their ships at the port of entrepreneurial success....The purpose of this book is to provide guidance and understanding on the underlying business strategies that impact black entrepreneurial success in America.\\" In fact, most (if not all) of the 52 principles can be of substantial benefit to anyone. Wallace organizes his material within four Parts, suggesting a program which has a one-year timeline:<br />Principles of Entrepreneurship Preparation [Weeks 1-13]<br />Principles of Building Entrepreneurial Success [Weeks 14-26]<br />Principles of Entrepreneurship Maintenance [Weeks 27-45]<br />Principles of Self-Actualization [Weeks 46-52]<br />As Wallaces explains, these various principles are introduced to the reader through \\"short, heartwarming true stories that were shared with me by successful black and minority entrepreneurs over the past twenty years. Each has an accompanying principle to be meditated upon for a week.\\" Each of these stories illustrates how an individual was introduced to the principle and how she or he was able to leverage the event to help achieve a specific goal. Following each goal is a technical analysis of the pertinent principle.<br />One of the books greatest benefits is derived from a \\"Wisdom to Take Away\\" summary at the end of each chapter. For example, here is a portion of one of four mini-commentaries provided at the conclusion of the chapter devoted to Week 1: \\"Despite the difficulties, all of us are endowed with three types of assets: time, talent, and treasure. All of us are provided with 24 hours in each day to embrace and utilize these assets.\\" Wallace is quite correct when suggesting that an entrepreneurial venture shares much in common with a voyage. Hence the appropriateness of the lighthouse metaphor. While reading the book, encouraged to think in terms of the one-year timeline while urged to focus on significant details in appropriate sequence, the reader really does have the feeling that Wallace is his caring as well as knowledgeable navigator. I suggest that those who share my high regard for this book also check out Marc Allen's Visionary Business. Both books share much in common (eg thoughtful, well-written, practical, and reassuring) even as they approach similar subjects from somewhat different perspectives.

My own opinion is that the same twelve \\"Keys\\" could be almost as valuable to everyone else in business. I say \\"almost\\" because the perils and opportunities of entrepreneurship pose quite unique challenges which almost always must be overcome with limited resources, including (especially) experience. In Allen's fictionalized account, there are two main characters: The narrator and his mentor, Bernie. Allen devotes a separate chapter to each of the 12 \\"Keys\\" and then provides an Epilogue, followed by an Afterword in which he includes 25 principles and practices of visionary business. This term has many different, sometimes quite different denotations and connotations. In this context, Allen means (a) being able to envision with absolute clarity what you want your business to be and (b) building the business guided by that vision.<br />Having embarked on a number of entrepreneurial ventures myself, and now working with many others who have, I can personally attest to the great value of the \\"Keys\\" but it would be a disservice to the author and to you, were I to divulge them here. Each must be shared within the context of the on-going interaction between the two. Bernie asks all of the questions I wish someone had asked me. Of even greater value is the wisdom he shares, sometimes strategically withholding it until the narrator is ready for it. Their rapport reminds me of the rapport which Mitch Albom describes in Tuesdays with Morrie.<br />An entrepreneur is one who (literally) \\"undertakes\\", often at great risk and amidst uncertainty. That is true of  the narrator. With all due respect to the practical value of Bernie's business acumen, Allen reveals certain dimensions of Bernie's spirituality which are -- for me, at least -- at least as important as his impact on the narrator's business decisions. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Robert L. Wallace's Soul Food.

This is one of the very best books which examine \\"lessons\\" to be learned from various historical figures. Elizabeth is among the greatest leaders and managers who ever lived. Axelrod concentrates on her as the chief executive officer, first of a country and then of an emerging empire during one of European history's most turbulent periods. Consider what occurred during Elizabeth I's reign:<br /><br />* Establishment of the Church of England (in 1559)<br /><br />* Re-establishment of the authority of the British crown at a time when other monarchies were deteriorating<br /><br />* Re-establishment of English coinage after the nation's near (and total) bankruptcy<br /><br />* Support of exploratory voyages (e.g. by Drake and Raleigh) in the New World to lay what eventually became the foundation of the British Empire<br /><br />* Support of the cultural arts during what is now regarded as England's \\"Golden Age\\" (i.e. the Elizabethan Age) of literature, theater, and music<br /><br />* Survival of all manner of foreign threats (eg invasion by the Spanish armada in 1588) as well as domestic conspiracies (e.g, numerous assassination attempts)<br /><br />Axelrod organizes his material within ten chapters and focuses on 136 separate but interrelated \\"strategic lessons\\" to be learned from Elizabeth I's leadership and management as monarch from 1558 until her death in 1603. One value-added benefit of Axelrod's presentation is the inclusion of direct quotations which are skillfully correlated with key points. For example, she frequently affirms her total faith and trust in those whom she governs: \\"Let tyrants fear, I have always so behaved myself that under God I have placed my chiefest strength and safeguard in the loyal hearts and good will of my subjects.\\" Axelrod notes her accessibility to the so-called commoners, her eagerness to circulate among them, and her delight in interacting with them. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out O'L. Higgins & Gilberd's Leadership Secrets of Elizabeth I. In this volume, the authors include comments by more than 100 modern executives whom they interviewed \\"to find out if Elizabeth's lessons were valid today and if the queen had served them as a role model.\\" Yes and yes. I also recommend Starkey's brilliant biography which, in combination with the other two, brings this magnificent monarch to life; better yet, they suggest the relevance of that life to our own time.s volume, the authors include comments by more than 100 modern executives whom they interviewed \\"to find out if Elizabeth's lessons were valid today and if the queen had served them as a role model.\\" Yes and yes.

Here's how it works. I ask to meet with 5-10 key executives, with or without the CEO included. Each of those present, in rotation around the table, says to each of the others (one at a time): \\"Here is what you and your people could do to make my life much easier.\\" The exercise continues until each executive has spoken directly to every other person. All this takes about 60-90 minutes. Invariably the response is, \\"I had no idea. No problem. We'll be glad to do it. Why didn't you mention this before?\\" Everyone is involved, either asking for specific assistance from everyone else, or, learning how she or he could provide it.<br />I mention this basic exercise to suggest what probably motivated O'Dell and Grayson to write this book.

Garten has assembled sixteen different essays in which various experts identify a number of different strategies to consider and then suggest how such strategies could be implemented. The material is organized within four Parts:<br />Emerging Markets [eg Prahalad and Lieberthal on \\"The End of Corporate Imperialism\\"]<br />Europe and Asia [eg Williamson on \\"Asia's New Competitive Game\\"]<br />Corporate Strategies [eg Porter on \\"Clusters and the New Economics of Competition]<br />Leadership [three interviews: Victor Fung, Robert B. Shapiro, and John Browne]<br />Garten then provides Executive Summaries and About the Contributors, both sections giving the reader a frame-of-reference within which to evaluate the specific essays and their respective authors. Garten is eminently well-qualified. You are urged to check out another of his books, The Mind of the C.E.O., in which he shares what he learned from interviews with 40 CEOs of major global corporations.<br />In the Introduction, Garten identifies several \\"common themes\\" revealed throughout the sixteen essays: operating in a global market requires CEOs to rethink everything about their strategies -- even what strategy means in an environment which is changing so fast and is so brutally competitive; the best strategies require organizations that are set up for gathering massive amounts of information and processing it effectively; companies that succeed on a global scale are constant innovators; great global companies create a culture conducive to extensive internal and external collaboration; and finally, virtually all of the authors agree that change is brining unprecedented opportunity to capture markets and enhance shareholder value.<br />Who will derive the greatest benefit from this superb anthology of separate but inter-related essays? Obviously, the governing board members and other senior executives of global organizations (which include but are not limited to for-profits) as well as CEOs of companies which include one or more of the global organizations among their own clients. Also,  business students at the undergraduate and graduate levels who seek a single-volume source of information and insight concerning global strategies for the New Economy. (Have you checked out the price of textbooks lately?) For those in need of additional sources, Garten provides an abundance of them in the \\"About the Contributors\\" section.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book should also check out Dun &amp; Bradstreet's Guide to Doing Business Around the World (Morrison et al) and also, if relevant, Doing Business in Asia (Dunung) and/or The New Silk Road (Stuttard's observations on doing business in China). Having accurate and sufficient information is obviously very important but without an appropriate strategy, information cannot be effectively leveraged. Hence the importance of the diverse and abundant wisdom which is so readily available in this book.(which include but are not limited to for-profits) as well as CEOs of companies which include one or more of the global organizations among their own clients.

Varian and published by Harvard Business School Press. The titles of its ten chapters suggest the nature and extent of subjects covered: The Information Economy, Pricing Information, Versioning Information, Rights Management, Recognizing Lock-In, Managing Lock-In, Networks and Positive Feedback, Cooperation and Compatibility, Waging a Standards War, and Information Policy. In effect, Information Rules combines all of the benefits of an operations manual with the counsel of two renowned experts who accompany the reader, step by step, through the manual.<br />According to the authors, the thesis of their book is that \\"durable economic principles can guide you through today's frenetic business environment. Technology changes. Economic laws do not. If you are struggling to comprehend what the Internet means for you and your business, you can learn a great deal from the advent of the telephone system a hundred years ago.\\" That's true. The interdependence of information (software) and infrastructure (hardware) will always be important, indeed imperative. Therefore, interconnection battles are won only if, for example, local telephone companies in 1900 were interconnected with Bell to provide long-distance service and, 100 years later, browsers are interconnected with operating systems.<br />The authors \\"use the term information very broadly. Essentially, anything that can be digitized -- encoded as a stream of bits -- is information.\\"  However, Information Rules focuses on models, not trends; concepts, not vocabulary; and analysis, not analogies. Recall the previous reference to \\"durable economic principles.\\" Trends come and go, as do vocabularies; therefore, today's brilliant analogies may well make no sense tomorrow, or even later today. Hence the necessity of durable principles, principles which continue to guide efforts to anticipate and then manage what Peter Drucker has called \\"the consequences of what has yet to occur.\\"<br />The Chinese character for \\"crisis\\" has two different meanings: peril and opportunity. The title of Information Rules can also be interpreted in two different ways: rules of principle and rules of dominance. In a Darwinian sense, those who dominate the Information Age will be those who apply the right principles. What do Shapiro and Varian suggest?<br />With regard to the pricing of information, the subject of Chapter 2, they suggest two strategies: don't be greedy and play tough. The \\"lessons\\" to be learned are to personalize your product and personalize your service, \\"know thy customer\\", differentiate your prices when possible, and use promotions to measure demand. Indeed, at the end of each chapter, they summarize \\"lessons\\" to be learned after having suggested specific strategies to apply them. In the \\"Further Reading\\" \\"Bibliography\\" sections which conclude Information Rules, Shapiro and Varian direct the reader to various sources to which they referred previously.<br />Who will gain the greatest value from this book? Owners/CEOs of small-to-midsize companies which are struggling to decide what to do...and what not to do...with opportunities created by the Internet and, more specifically, the WWW. Also, senior-level executives of much larger organizations (both for-profit and not-for-profit) who must formulate long-term strategies to achieve sustainable prudent growth. For thousands of years, there has never been a shortage of available information but until the printing press, access to it was severely limited. Since then, a variety of media have broadened and deepened that access and, indeed, the volume of available information has increased exponentially.<br />According to Shapiro and Varian, the challenge today is not one of access; rather, the challenge is to follow certain \\"certain durable principles\\" on which effective strategies are based.No one knows precisely how and to what extent the network economy will change in years to come. Principles which endure are those which accommodate change, whenever it occurs, whatever it proves to be. Shapiro and Varian suggest what those principles should be.<br />Information Rules is a stunning achievement.ed.

E-mails, for example. Raimes has assembled essential information about the writing process, using sources, documenting sources, common sentence problems, punctuation and mechanics, and advice for multilingual/ESL writers. She also provides glossaries and an index. The book itself is about the size of a pocket secretary but will probably be transported within an attache case where it requires very little space. It can be taken anywhere. One of its most valuable features is the attention Raimes devotes to incorrect or ineffective sentences. The corrections point out errors, of course, but also illustrate which sentences are crisp as well as grammatically correct...and which are not. Will this little booklet tell you everything you need to know about grammar, punctuation, and usage? Of course not. But it will certainly help you to communicate your ideas with greater clarity.<br />If your problems with writing are REALLY severe, I suggest that you invest in the services of a local schoolteacher. Specifically, one who reminds you of that tyrant you will never forget when you were in 3rd or 4th grade. In my school, we called her &quot;Miss Fussy.&quot; She could spot a dangling modifier, split infinitive, or a run-on sentence in the next county. Trust me, time spent with Ann Raimes will be much more enjoyable.	2001-02-03

It combines all of the essential ingredients: colorful and credible characters, a crisp and cohesive plot, important themes, memorable incidents which become defining moments, all manner of compelling conflicts, and a remarkable authenticity of setting. Patterson also demonstrates a special gift for wit, evident in countless conversations between antagonists.<br />Briefly, Kerry Kilcannon, President of the United States, nominates Caroline Masters to replace the recently deceased Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He has sworn to &quot;protect and defend the Constitution of the United States&quot; and believes that Masters is best qualified to help him do so. There is fierce opposition to her in the Senate, led by MacDonald Page. Another Senator, Chad Palmer,  is caught in the political maneuverings between Kilcannon and Gage. That is one of two primary plots. The second focuses on Mary Anne Tierney, a pregnant and unwed teenager, who sues her parents to abort what is believed to be a terminally deformed fetus. This is in defiance of their Pro Life convictions as well as the recently passed Protection of Life bill which Gage and his cohorts are determined to &quot;protect and defend.&quot; There are also various sub-plots.<br />The more I think about the title, the better I understand why Patterson chose it.  His primary and secondary characters all struggle to protect and defend themselves in terms of their values, their fiduciary and (in several instances) parental responsibilities, their social and/or political leverage, and their carefully-guarded secrets. Patterson is a great storyteller. Also, he reveals a deep concern for preserving a nation's constitutional integrity.<br />This is a \\"great read\\" which, obviously, I recommend highly.	2001-02-01

It can help almost anyone to establish and then sustain direct contact, not only with prospects and clients but also with virtually anyone else of special importance to the organization. The term &quot;direct marketing&quot; is by no means limited to creating or increasing demand for whatever one sells.  Sugarman's various strategies and tactics can also be effective to improve communications (eg with employees and vendors) and to strengthen relationships with allies (eg third-party centers of influence which can generate leads). One word of caution: Because Sugarman's enthusiasm can be contagious, it is imperative to (a) know precisely what you want to accomplish and then (b) select only what is specifically appropriate to the immediate objective. Don't try to do everything at once. Set priorities and be prepared to modify them. I cannot think of a prior time in the history of American business when Sugarman's ideas would have greater value.	2001-01-31

Baker examines his family and his place within that family's development...as well as his place within the American political system. I grew up in Chicago in a family of Democrats who adored FDR and, later, Adlai Stevenson. (They really didn't know quite what to make of Truman nor, for that matter, did Truman know quite what to make of Stevenson.) I begn to follow Stevenson's career when he was governor of Illinois, delighted by his dry wit. Unlike Lincoln's, his career did not lead from Springfield to the White House. His manner was that of a patrician and his demeanor that of an intellectual. (Eisenhower once called him an &quot;egghead.&quot;) On occasion, he seemed to lack an appetite for politics or at least for campaigning for public office. Thanks to Baker, I now have a much better understanding of his Scottish ancestry, of his youth, and of the formative years preceding his governship. Contrary to what the elders in my family firmly believed, Stevenson was no saint. For me, that makes him all-the-more interesting. Perhaps his finest moment in public life occurred when, as our ambassador to the U.N., he challenged the ambassador from the U.S.S.R. to admit that it had deployed missiles in Cuba. That took courage and eloquence which Stevenson possessed in abundance. So many fine books have been written about the Kennedys, the Rockefellers, and the Roosevelts. Another family, the Stevensons, has now received the attention it deserves.	2001-01-31

It correctly suggests both the man's wizardry and humanity. Jabbar and Walton have almost nothing in common except their talent to play basketball and their love and respect for Coach Wooden. He is proud of them but probably just as proud of hundreds of other players (most known only to him, their families, and friends) who are physicians, educators, artists, attorneys, public servants, corporate executives, entertainers, etc. He set very high standards, especially for himself. He prepared for each practice and each game with meticulous care. He hated losing for lack of a maximum effort but accepted defeat (after a maximum effort) with exceptional style and grace. Anyone who has any association with children, especially those privileged to coach at any level, should read this book. And may I add, anyone who feels adrift in her or his life should also read this book. The &quot;lessons&quot; provided helped to win so many NCAA national basketball champlionships; they also helped to develop the character of those who played on the U.C.L.A. teams which won them.	2001-01-31

Our journey to gaining at least an adequate understanding of Ronald Reagan has only just begun. He continues to attract substantial attention, both favorable and unfavorable. My own opinion is that his advocates (who tend to deify him) and his adversaries (who tend to demonize him) need to calm down. Reagan was certainly neither an amiable dimwit nor a charming genius. My guess is, that he was probably somewhere between such extremes, except for his commitment to certain basic values which were, for him, non-negotiable. Here in a single volume are many of Reagan's most important statements about those values. His convictions are remarkably clear and consistent. How many of Reagan's critics have examined with appropriate care what he stated publicly in correlation with the policies he so steadfastly advocated? The &quot;talk&quot; he talked and the &quot;walk&quot; he walked are virtually inseparable. Someday, perhaps, it will be possible to take Reagan's full measure as an American President, at least within the context of the 20th century. Meanwhile, books about him will continue to be published. In fairness to him, those who now hold him in low esteem should at least know what his values were inorder to understand why as well as how he acted upon those values.	2001-01-31

Both at work and at home, we function either as a mentor or as a student. And in some situations, as both. We provide or receive information, suggestions, criticism, etc. This is an on-going process. How can we help others to learn more? How can we can learn more from others? These and other key questions are posed and then addressed in this book. Daloz focuses primarily on the mentor (or teacher) whose \\"partnership\\" with each student \\"finally determines the value of an education. In the nature of that partnership lies the mentor's art.\\" Those who share my high opinion of this book are urged to check out Peter Senge's The Fifth Discipline [bold face] and The Dance of Change bold face]. I am reminded of a situation years ago when there was a tuition increase at Harvard and parents vehemently protested. Then president Derek Bok responded \\"If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.\\" The value of the mentor's art may be incalculable (I believe it is) but, as Daloz carefully explains, it is an art worthy of those who practice it with passion, competence, and commitment.<br />Daloz explains that this book \\"is directed to all those who seek a fuller understanding of the life changes accompanying adult learners as they go on to postsecondary education. But it does more than simply describe or dramatize those changes....It goes on to suggest how we can work more effectively with the new learners to enrich their educational experience and decrease the likelihood that they will drop out.\\" That is to say, the primary purpose of this book is to \\"offer new perspectives for understanding adult learners and to suggest concrete and practical ways based on developmental theory how we can work more effectively to improve the quality of their educational experience.\\" At the heart of Daloz' book are the interviews and personal descriptions needed to ground the principles, concepts, and theories.

The subtitle indicates Silverman's thematic objective: To examine \\"the search for sacred art.\\" She provides her reader with a brilliantly written narrative during which she shares a wealth of information about Van Gogh and Gauguin, of course, in combination with hundreds of illustrations (many in full-color) which are skillfully correlated with the text. Here is how the material is organized:<br />Part One: Toward Collaboration [two \\"Self-Portraits\\"]<br />Part Two: Peasant Subjects and Sacred Forms [eg Van Gogh's \\"Sower\\" and Gauguin's \\"Vision After the Sermon\\"]<br />Part Three: Catholic Idealism and Dutch Reformed Realism<br />Part Four: Collaboration in Arles<br />Part Five: Theologies of Art After Arles<br />Part Six: Modernist Catechism and Sacred Realism<br />Silverman carefully identifies and then eloquently explores all manner of comparisons and contrasts between the lives and art of Van Gogh and Gauguin within an historical, theological, and anthropological context.

For most readers, there is probably more information than they need or want. Many readers will have greater interest in Asia than in Europe...or vice versa; greater interest in naval battles than in land battles...or vice versa. My point is, the breadth and much of the depth of the Second World War are examined by Murray and Millett about as well as is possible in any single volume. Their Index is adequate to most readers' needs but perhaps (in the next edition) it could be developed in somewhat greater detail to accommodate those readers who have much more specific interests. The authors' notes for each of the book's 20 chapters suggest a wealth of supplementary sources for those readers which enable them to explore such subjects in greater depth. It is worth noting that a great deal of intelligence data (eg concerning code-breaking technologies such as the Ultra machine) did not become available until the 1970s. Decades later, the authors draw upon this information when explaining the implications and consequences of key strategies. Obviously, such an analysis could not have been possible while World War Two was in progress, nor during the years immediately following its conclusion in 1945.	2001-01-10

The subjects are Woody Allen, David Mamet, Frank Sinatra, Arthur Miller, Liev Screiber, Roseanne, Irving Berlin, Wallace Shawn, Eddie Izzard, Neil Labute, Bob Hope, Ingmar Bergman, Mike Nichols, and the author's parents, Mildred and Bert Lahr. My personal favorites are those which discuss Sinatra, Miller, Roseanne, Hope, Bergman, and Nichols but I was pleased to re-read all of the others also. Lahr has a somewhat specialized form of genius for crafting what are indeed \\"profiles\\" rather than portraits, much less in-depth character analyses. Even when fondly discussing his own parents, he seems to have no limiting biases, \\"baggage\\" or predilections. It is high praise to note that the reader feels as if she or he is a &quot;fly on the wall&quot; during Lahr's conversations with his subjects...and at other times, as if the reader can hear him thinking aloud while alone and in reflection. Lahr's is a naturally casual style (so sophisticated that it seems effortless), perhaps most evident when discussing Bob Hope. According to Lahr, Hope's wife Dolores and the children were \\"extras\\" in his life. \\"It was hard for anyone in the family to get much of Bob Hope.\\" Lahr shares this without judgment, suggesting implications without manipulating inferences.. With Hope as with each of the 14 others, Lahr's objective is to capture the essence of his subject, the esential qualities and characteristics which are revealed in \\"defining moments\\" of inimitable behavior or utterance. Lahr's reader (at least this one) is left to wonder what he would have to say about so many others such as Saul Bellow, Hillary Rodham-Clinton, Joe DiMaggio, Bob Fosse, Jackie Gleason, Sam Peckinpah, Jackson Pollock, Martha Stewart, and Oprah Winfrey.	2001-01-10

Part One:  rules that will help you adopt -- and reinforce -- the right core ideas for achievement, day in and day out). Schiffman calls this process \\"Obsessing about the right stuff.\\" Part Two: some tools you can use to make the right things happen in your business relationships. Part Three: rules for keeping your focus over time...and persevering when people give you \\"static\\", aggravation which is pretty much inevitable. The title should not be taken literally. Obviously, as Schiffman already knows full well, not everything happens before lunch...or by day's end. He asserts that high achievers \\"have three things going for them\\": They know what they want to accomplish when considering an opportunity to make a good business relationship happen; they recognize other opportunities which will not make a good relationship happen; and finally, \\"they've figured out how to spend the vast majority of their time in the first situation -- and how to avoid spending any more time than necessary in the second situation.\\" Who will derive the greatest benefit from reading this book? Anyone who needs \\"cut-to-the chase strategies\\" for getting the business results they desire. Does Schiffman believe that such results can be achieved before lunch? Of course not. My own opinion is that unless strategies such as these are implemented, someone else will have you for lunch...not as a guest but as an entree.	2001-01-05

A great deal of nonsense has already been expressed on the subject of leaders motivating others. The greatest leaders throughout history do indeed demonstrate the power to inspire others but, I have become convinced, only an individual can motivate herself or himself. Chandler offers 100 quite specific suggestions, each accompanied by no-nonsense comments. I agree with him that attitudes often determine our behavior, including the choices we make. \\"In our on-going creation of who we are, nothing has a greater impact on the process than the choice we make between optimism and pessimism.\\" He continues: \\"There are no optimistic or pessimistic personalities, there are only single, individual choices for optimistic or pessimistic thought.\\" If you have problems with your own motivation and/or associate with others who have that problem, I strongly encourage you to read this book. Then, if you share my high opinion of it, I urge you to check out Chandler's other books including the recently published 17 Lies That Set You Back &amp; the Truth That Will Set you Free.	2001-01-05

The material is organized within four Parts: Health (\\"An ache here, a pain there. So what?\\"), Empowerment, (\\"Live as you jolly well please.\\"), Romance (\\"There may be snow on the roof, but there's a fire blazing in the oven.\\"), and Inner Peace  (\\"Living from the inside out.\\"). Quite correctly, Beckford affirms the importance of physical as well as mental and emotional health. An abundance of research confirms that older people (ie those in \\"the second half of life\\") live longer, recover more quickly from illness, and (generally) are much happier if they sustain a positive attitude. Beckford generously shares from her own, extensive personal experience. (\\"This book has been a lifetime in the making.\\") She neither preaches nor harangues. She includes dozens of quotations, some serious and others amusing. She concludes her book with a list of 10 \\"sayings\\" she has \\"invented.\\" Here are three to give you a sense of her style and perspective:<br />1.  \\"When you're casual about life, you'll end up a casualty.\\"<br />4.  \\"If you stand for nothing, you'll fall for anything.\\"<br />8.  \\"Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift. That's why it's called the present.\\"<br />Some readers may think such sayings are \\"corny\\" or \\"obvious.\\" Quite true, there is very little &quot;new&quot; in this little book. For me, many of what Beckford calls \\"affirmations\\" are really \\"reaffirmations\\" of what I already knew but seldom consider. I plan to re-read this book periodically. Also, I will continue to give copies as a gift to friends. But not to all my friends. Nor only to those \\"in the second half of life.\\" Rather, to those who will be receptive to what Beckford shares so generously. One final thought: Many (most?) residents of retirement communities -- and especially those in assisted living facilities -- will derive great benefit from reading this book. If you have loved ones among this group, you should seriously consider giving this book as a gift to them. Just a thought....se in assisted living facilities -- will derive great benefit from reading this book.

But, as we all know, not all members of a group share the same beliefs, values, and behaviors. Moreover, this book is not intended to be a definitive study of every group discussed. Instead, it makes use of some distinctive tendencies in each group to demonstrate how these tendencies may affect personal interaction, teamwork, and promotional opportunities in the workplace.\\" As the subtitle correctly suggests, the authors suggest seven strategies for success \\"when you're not a member of the dominant group in your workplace.\\" That is, when you are outside and determined to get inside. Here are the strategies: 1. Check Your Baggage, 2. Call Out the Cavalry, 3. Accentuate the Positive, 4. Blow Your Horn, 5. Buy In, Don't Sell Out, 6. Know Your Rights, and 7. Have a Vision. Each of these seven strategies is carefully explained and then illustrated. The material is based on real-world experiences, strategies, and tactics recommended by real people. If you are (or feel that you are) excluded from the dominant group in your own workplace, I urge you to obtain a copy of this book and read it with appropriate care. Moreover, I presume to share a few personal caveats of my own.  First, not all \\"in\\" groups are worthy of joining. Also, those who are \\"in\\" today may be \\"out\\" tomorrow and then \\"gone\\" soon thereafter. Finally, the strengths you now possess (ie what you have inside of yourself) such as intelligence, integrity, and passion are far more important than acceptance by a group whose members may lack them. Shakespeare's Polonius was right: &quot;To thine ownself be true.&quot;	2001-01-05

Throughout eight chapters, Swiss suggests how women can \\"add swagger to their step, put on a game face, balance feminine and masculine traits, maneuver adversity and adversaries, cope with mixed signals and the great gender divide.\\" She also offers reasons men why like working with women, secrets of strong leaders, and concludes with suggestions as to how to open \\"the gender lens. \\"Here is a woman's guide to working with men. (It could also serve as a man's guide to working with other men as well as with women.) Based on extensive interviews, Swiss offers some insightful comments and practical suggestions which, in this male's opinion, will help women to improve (or at least clarify) their relationships with men. Of course, not all men think and act alike; nor do all women. We all know abrasive and aggressive women as well as gentle and acquiescent men. Each possesses a unique combination of what are perceived to be masculine and feminine traits. Men and women often approach quite differently a broad range of career issues such as hiring and firing, conveying confidence, facing competition, participating on a team, building business alliances, saying \\"no\\" and setting limits, dealing with difficult people and difficult situations, managing and motivating others. Sound familiar? I agree with Swiss that there are certain \\"valuable truths about the male psyche\\" which, properly understood, can reduce (if not eliminate) problems many women have with that psyche in action. (Many males do not as yet understand, much less appreciate these \\"valuable truths.\\") This book will be valuable for anyone who seeks a better understanding of the male mentality, not only at work but everywhere else.	2001-01-05

This same understanding is imperative for men with whom these women associate in their workplace. I'm not saying women's obligations are better or worse than those men have. But many of them are significantly different. True, assignment of marital and parental obligtions often has less to do with gender than with practicality. Of necessity, some Baby Boomers and many Generation Xers have re-defined concepts such as &quot;partnering&quot; and &quot;division of labor.&quot; The process of re-definition or refinement will accelerate with Generation Yers. One of Williams' key points is that at work and in the home, indeed everywhere, men and women must have the courage and (yes) the patience to collaborate and accommodate in ways and to an extent which spouses and parents never have before. Those unable to &quot;bend&quot; with appropriate adjustment and (yes) with good will could well &quot;break.&quot; Williams identifies various major problems and their causes, then suggests how those problems could be avoided or solved. You may not agree with all of her opinions (fair enough) but I think you will agree that she addresses important issues with care and concern. So must each of us.	2001-01-05

The title refers to the \\"self-destructive and exhausting ritual\\" to which so many women become hostage. For many of them, this shift seems endless. Bolton observes: \\"Rather than deriving joy from their choices as women -- to work, to stay at home, to help out in the community -- many women are half-crazed by the constant demands, options, and trade-offs.\\" She organizes her material within three Parts:<br />The Identity Challenge: Who Are We?<br />The Task Challenge: What Do We Do?<br />The Balance Challenge: Who Comes First?<br />Bolton draws upon a wealth of research (hers and others') which guides and informs her observations, recommendations, and conclusions. In the Afterword, she suggests that \\"In many ways, women today live in a surreal world, floating back and forth between an outdated cultural mirror that prescribes certain genderized roles, and then careening suddenly toward the possibility of an entirely new image, with as-yet-unknown life scripts and patterns for its many actors and actresses.\\" Although written for women, this book should also be be read by men who also have \\"hard choices\\" to make. If they make the correct choices, perhaps many of the decisions made by women will be less difficult.	2001-01-05

Indeed, the Rieses' use of the word \\"laws\\" may itself be subject to debate. However, the authors do provide 11 helpful guidelines when suggesting how to achieve effective \\"Internet \\"branding.\\" For example, (1) The Internet can be a business or a medium, but not both, (6) Advertising off the Net will be a lot bigger than advertising on the Net, (9) The biggest mistake of all is believing that you can do anything and (10) Everyone talks about convergence., while just the opposite is happening.<br />Perhaps you have already read previous books authored or co-authored by Al Ries. Positioning, for example, in which several of the same branding \\"laws\\" or guidelines are advocated. In this book, he and his co-author apply them specifically to the Internet.<br />For small-to-midsize companies especially, this can be a very valuable book. In the Age of Commoditization, it is seldom possible for such companies to be ranked first in their category or first entrant in their competitive marketplace (see Laws #5 and #8). Of course, the Rieses understand that. However, small-to-midsize companies CAN prosper if they take full advantage of certain competitive advantages which their size makes possible, especially speed (eg rapid response to a given situation) and resiliency (eg \\"turn on a dime\\"). Interestingly enough, huge corporations such as GE and Cisco Systems implement strategies based on essentially the same principles which the Rieses advocate.	2001-01-04

Here is a book which does indeed provide a \\"How-To Guide to Women and Companies.\\" Part One explains how to design and implement a women's network. Part Two explains how to extend and strengthen that network. Then the reader is provided with a wealth of Resources which include \\"Catalyst's Summary Findings from The Women's Workplace Network Survey\\" and examples of successful women's networks (Dow Chemical, Bausch &amp; Lomb, Kodak, and Kimberly- Clark). Of special value to the reader is a series of charts (eg Chart 4.2, \\"Support Continuum: Middle Management\\") and Checklists (one per each of the seven chapters) which, together, provide just about all anyone would need to design, implement, strengthen, and (yes) defend a successful women's network.	2001-01-04

Confrontation is inevitable.  Think about it: What REALLY upsets you? How about \\"road rage\\" when someone else cuts you off, tailgates, deliberately forces you to the side of the road, etc.? Or how about \\"office politicians\\" who lie both to your face and behind your back, thrive on hurtful gossip, and in countless other ways try to advance themselves at the cost of others? Make no mistake about it: Negative Confrontation also has power.<br />Pachter has a specific objective in mind: To enable those to read the book to master the skills needed to resolve confrontation is positive, constructive, and beneficial ways. As indicated in the Preface, she wants each reader to be able to say \\"I don't feel frustrated any more...\\" or \\"In the past I would have sulked or complained until the person got the hint, now I can just say something...\\" or \\"Annoying things don't bother me as much because I know I can say something now.\\"<br />The book consists of 16 chapters, ranging from \\"Positive Confrontation -- What It Is and How It Can Make Your Life Better\\" to \\"International Etiquette\\", with Chapter 16 followed by a \\"Final 12-Step Pep Talk.\\" Over the course of the book, Pachter covers just about every conceivable situation in which conflict can occur at work, home, and in life. I think this book will be invaluable to individual readers as well as to senior-level executives who can use much of the material to help those whom they supervise to master the same skills.	2001-01-04

You probably won't recognize more than a few of their names. After you learn what all of them have accomplished (most after overcoming great obstacles), you will perhaps be inspired to seek your own ambitious objectives. According to Mikaelian, the profiles are organized within two Parts: \\"Each woman was asked a lot of standard questions about their greatest rewards, achievements, and challenges. Each one gave advice to women just getting started, and each one offered her personal definition of success. The answers reflect just how diverse these women are. Their answers are followed by a short -- in every case too short --biography that outlines their careers, using as many of their own words as possible. These biographies are brief attempts to honor these women and give them a platform for their thoughts, reflections, and stories.\\"<br />If asked to name \\"successful business women\\", most of us immediately think of  Mary Kay Ash, Liz Claiborne, Carly Fiorina, Estee Lauder, Mary Meeker, Lillian Vernon, Linda Wachner, and Oprah Winfrey. What makes Mikaelian's book unique is the fact that none of the women featured is a celebrity. What else do they have in common? \\"Regardless of their profession, education, or background, all of these professionals share a commitment to improving their world through community service.\\" Given how generously all of them responded to Mikaelian's request for information, it is also true that they are determined to be of assistance to other women who also \\"mean business\\", especially those about to embark on a business career.	2001-01-04

Please, no more forced comparisons and contrasts between the battlefield and the workplace. Enough! With regard to the excellent text, as Hammer explains in the Introduction, one of her basic concepts is that there are \\"three stages of personal and professional growth.\\" All three \\"can be characterized by their attitudes toward risk and the need for approval. These three stages are those of the apprentice, the warrior, and the adventurer.\\" She has much of value to say about each, especially in terms of how each differs from the other two. Her larger objectives are, in my opinion, (a) to help her reader to decide which \\"battles\\" to fight as well as which to ignore, and, (b) to help her reader \\"win\\" more often on the \\"corporate battlefield.\\"<br />According to Hammer, the defining characteristic of the apprentice is the need for external approval. The primary difference between the apprentice and the warrior is that the warrior's goals sufficiently compel her to risk disapproval and engage in conflict, while the apprentice is not yet either dissatisfied or secure enough to assume such risk.\\" While apprentices focus on approval and warriors on vindication, adventurers focus on challenge and discovery. \\"They value respect, friendship, and recognition, but they do not need these things.\\"<br />In Section I (\\"Rules of Engagement\\"), Hammer examines specific issues when running a private company and then other issues when planning an exit strategy. Then in Section II (\\"Basic Training\\"), she discusses effective communication in the workplace, strategies for dealing with conflict, and acquiring allies. Having thus prepared her reader for \\"combat\\", Hammer concludes with Section III (\\"The Battle and Beyond\\") in which she explains how to maximize chances for victory, why we tend to love and fear authority, and what can be learned from loss as a precursor to success. In the Epilogue, Hammer suggests that \\"Our real challenge is to conquer our shadow enemies --  those that mask our fear and pain -- so that regardless of our success in the battles we wage in the workplace, we move forward with greater serenity and satisfaction.\\" If your own workplace often seems to be a battlefield and you feel ill-equipped to engage in combat,  Hammer's insights and advice will be invaluable to you.ts that \\"Our real challenge is to conquer our shadow enemies --  those that mask our fear and pain -- so that regardless of our success in the battles we wage in the workplace, we move forward with greater serenity and satisfaction.\\" If your own workplace often seems to be a battlefield and you feel ill-equipped to engage in combat,  Hammer's insights and advice will be invaluable to you.	2001-01-04

Rosen focuses on various \\"MindBlocks\\" and \\"RoadBlocks\\" (to both business success and personal fulfillment) which so many women (and men) encounter. They're all there in twelve chapters which Rosen calls \\"Sessions.\\"<br />Her strategic approach to each \\"Session\\" is brilliant: \\"Let's talk about\\"....and then she does. Problems with money, with self-expectations, with relationships, with sexuality, with \\"faking it\\", with negative attitudes, with bad habits, with self-esteem, with wishful thinking (eg denial), with stress, and with success (ie fear thereof). Has she missed any of your own concerns? Rosen also includes immensely valuable \\"Resources for Business Owners\\" which can also be of great value to non-business owners. With regard to the book's title, none of the information I have about Rosen indicates that she has received any formal training as a therapist...nor does she at any time suggest or even imply it. For those in need of therapy, she strongly encourages them to obtain it from a highly qualified and carefully selected professional.<br />For many years, Rosen has been actively involved in all manner of organizations, programs, and activities to support women's efforts to succeed in business. What she learned as a result of that involvement is generously and eloquently shared in this book.	2001-01-04

The term \\"frivolous lawsuit\\" is really a misnomer. Check a reputable dictionary of synonyms and you will learn that the word frivolous connotes \\"trivial, trifling, piddling, unimportant, insignificant, inconsiderable, petty, and paltry.\\" On the contrary, an adverse decision resulting from a so-called frivolous lawsuit can destroy a company which has limited resources...or at least create truly serious problems for it, most of which are preventable.<br />The subtitle of Weiss's book correctly indicates that he explains \\"safe hiring, managing &amp; firing practices to keep you &amp; your company out of court.\\" He organizes the material as follows:<br />Part I Safe Hiring Practices [re recruiting, interviewing, and employment decisions]<br />Part II Safe Management Practices  [re evaluations and promotions, preventing sex discrimination and sexual harassment on the job, employee action laws and labor rights]<br />Part III Safe Firing Practices [re discipline and firing practices, public policy, management of older employees]<br />With Weiss's guidance, it is possible for the decision-makers in any company to complete what amounts to a comprehensive \\"audit\\" of any and all areas in which that company could be vulnerable to litigation. Of at least equal importance, the same \\"audit\\" will help the company to determine precisely what its obligations are as an employer as well as what the legal rights of its employees are.<br />Ultimately, with all due respect to Weiss, qualified legal counsel should be consulted to ensure that all of a company's policies and procedures are \\"fair, square &amp; legal.\\" They must then be explained to all employees. Finally, they must be rigorously and consistently enforced. Even so, there may yet be frivolous lawsuits but at least the company has done everything possible to prevent them and is thus much better prepared to obtain a favorable decision in a court of law.ous lawsuits but at least the company has done everything possible to prevent them and is thus much better prepared to obtain a favorable decision in a court of law.	2001-01-04

What are the major differences between sales and marketing? Why are these differences so important to understand?<br />2. Why are most traditional selling strategies and skills no longer effective?<br />3. How can we identify the largest market of prime prospects to buy what we sell?<br />4.

How can newsletters, brochures, and direct mail be used to maximum advantage?<br />6. Exactly what is segmented database marketing? What its unique functions, features, and benefits?<br />7. For those with limited resources, what are the most effective Internet strategies to consider?<br />8. What are the major obstacles to \\"creative thinking\\"? How can they be overcome?<br />9. What are Graham's 17 \\"Laws\\"?<br />10. What are his \\"Ten Commandments for Losing Customers\\"?<br />Graham offers sensible answers to all of these questions. What I find remarkable is the fact that, after accumulating more than 30 years of real-world experience in both sales and marketing, Graham seems to have concluded that most of the \\"lessons\\" (ie \\"Commandments\\") he learned are either wrong or inadequate. (See Chapter 2, \\"Challenging the Traditional Wisdom.\\") He has assembled a \\"How to Do It\\" manual in which he examines the wide range of subjects indicated by the 10 questions previously listed. Graham's use of the magnet metaphor is apt because it correctly suggests the importance of both attracting customers and keeping them. In this book, he explains HOW.	2001-01-04

Now or very soon, a majority of us will work primarily in virtual environments. Therefore, organizations must provide support services (eg learning programs) which are user-friendly.<br /><br />Here is how Hartley organizes the material: The On-Demand Society, Some Highlights of Learning History, The On-Demand Learner, How to Enable On-Demand Learning, Technological Considerations for On-Demand Learning, On-Demand Learning Best Practices (Employee and Customer Examples), A Sample Technology-Enabled Learning Strategy, and A Functional Requirements Specification Template<br /><br />At the end of each Section,  Hartley summarizes key points and also provides a Glossary of key terms. This information will be especially helpful to the vast majority of readers who have relatively little (if any) prior experience with designing and/or managing on-demand learning programs. For them, I suggest, this book will be most valuable. In the New Millennium, only through various learning experiences will an organization's \\"greatest asset\\" (its people) be maximized as \\"intellectual capital.\\" Hence the great benefit of this book. In a single volume, Hartley presents just about everything a reasonably intelligent person needs to know to formulate and then implement effective on-demand learning in her or his organization. For more advanced discussions of this subject, I recommend the works of other authors such as Peter Senge. Meanwhile, for most executives who are (or will soon be) directly or indirectedly involved with relatively uncomplicated on-line training programs, Hartley's counsel and guidance will be invaluable.	2001-01-04

Glaser and Smalley are among the most influential of current business scholars because they think so clearly and write so well while discussing the most important issues. Perhaps you have already read their Swim with the Dolphins. If not, you are urged to do so. In this book, they focus on an especially timely subject: The importance of \\"soul\\"  in the equation for \\"success.\\" In recent years, I have examined the results of more than 30 \\"employee satisfaction\\" surveys and was surprised, frankly, by what were rated the highest attributes: feeling appreciated, being treated with respect, believing in the value of the work to be done, enjoying the work to be done, and trusting the organization by which one is employed. What about compensation? Depending upon the individual survey, it was ranked anywhere from ninth to thirteen in importance. For those who participated in the surveys and probably for most other workers, money is never enough and seldom most important. The authors ask all of the right questions but, to their credit, resist the temptation to advocate any \\":right answers.\\" That responsibility they entrust to each reader. Although this is another of recently published books which have  a gender-specific frame-of-reference, almost everything the authors share can also be of substantial value to men...not only to understand much better their mothers, sisters, wives, daughters, business associates, etc. but, more to the point, to understand themselves much better.	2001-01-04

For example, Chapter 1 presents and discusses aphorisms relevant to \\"Vision and Planning\\" whereas the subject of Chapter 5 is \\"Feedback and Performance Management: What You Reward Is What You Get\\" and the subject of Chapter 9 is \\"Leadership.\\" At the end of each chapter, McNair summaries its key points and then poses \\"Questions for Reflection.\\"<br />Here's an excerpt from Chapter 2 which is representative of McNair's style. In it he discusses the assertion that \\"No One Can Motivate Anyone to Do Anything.\\" After having reviewed a number of motivational films, he concluded:<br />Motivation \\"doesn't come out of film cans. It comes from people's heads and hearts. And we can't get into their heads and hearts --we are forever wholly elsewhere, in an orbit totally outside them. So we cannot ever motivate anyone to do anything -- it has to come from inside them. But we can [italics] create an environment in which others motivate themselves.\\"<br />McNair describes himself as a \\"reductionist -- as a simplifier\\" who expresses complicated concepts in basic language. Moreover, he really means it when he suggests that \\"No one is sane; you're looking for compatible craziness\\" or \\"The madder you get, the dumber you are.\\"<br />Obviously, McNair is fond of Benjamin Franklin and Mark Twain but also, I suspect, of Oscar Wilde. Who will derive the greatest benefit from McNair's maxims? First, those who have only recently embarked on a business career and will appreciate practical, no-nonsense advice in a conversational format. Also, others who have been swimming laps in a corporate blender for quite a few years and need a fresh perspective or two. And perhaps a reason to smile.

The Yoda replies, \\"Do or do not. There is no try.\\" The authors of this book agree with the Yoda. They suggest that responsible managers insist on achieving results. While chairman and CEO of Pier 1 Imports, Clark Johnson observed that he always encouraged effort but only rewarded performance. Johnson may not have read this book but he certainly agrees with the key points its authors make.<br />In Chapter 1, they revisit and redefine the concept of responsibility. In subsequent chapters, they discuss a leader's responsibility to  the customer, to the organization, and to everyone within the organization. They view the responsible manager as a problem solver and, in Chapter 5, provide a problem-solving approach \\"that works.\\" They then shift their attention to \\"Getting the Right Answer\\" and \\"Getting the Right Result.\\" For the authors, judgment is the foundation of responsibility. They also assert, in Chapter 9, that there is \\"a rationale for teams that work\\" and then explain what that rationale is...also, what it requires of everyone involved. In Chapters 10 and 11, they answer two key questions: How to design an effective team? and How to maximize productivity among the members of a team? In the final chapter, the authors explain what is needed to keep responsible change alive.<br />According to the authors, \\"most change efforts fail because of an inadequate understanding of what produces value in the business or of how human beings change.&quot; They then offer eight specific reasons why change efforts fail:<br />1. We like to feel good. [change threatens comfort levels]<br />2. No top leadership support [if \\"they\\" don't care, why should anyone else?]<br />3. Change efforts do not address the whole system [a fragmented approach tends to focus on symptoms rather than on causes]<br />4. We hide failure [success is reassuring...failure could involve blame and guilt]<br />5. Misunderstanding of what has changed [See #3]<br />6. Too few understand the rationale for change efforts [ie those who are expected to support change initiatives are not told how and why their support is so essential]<br />7. Neglect of transition [failure to understand that change is an incremental process, not a quantum leap from \\"here\\" to \\"there\\"]<br />8. There is no structure for change [within the organization, there are no policies and procedures to resolve the conflict between \\"what is done now\\" and \\"doing better\\"]<br />Hence the importance of having a sense of responsibility to help solve problems shared by everyone, of having patience during the inevitably slow process of organizational change, and of having self-discipline throughout that challenging process. The authors correctly point out that (1) \\"everyone must be willing to  carry his or her share of the load\\", (2) \\"Sustainable efforts take two to three years but result in dramatically more healthy and more exciting organizations\\", and (3) \\"The discipline of change refers to the regularity with which change is pursued as well as emerging skills that are developed through devotion to change.\\"  A responsible leader understands all this, conducts herself or himself accordingly, and requires everyone else to do so also. Working together, they identify problems and then solve them. \\"There is no try....\\" and excuses are unacceptable.<br />One final point: Recent research suggests that by 2025 at the latest (but probably much sooner), organizational rewards will be completely based on performance. To varying degrees, responsible leaders have been supporting that policy for decades.lt]<br />5. Misunderstanding of what has changed [See #3]<br />6.

Of course, they do. For Austin, there is one force which united all eight issues for variopus women cited, and powerfully shaped their careers: \\"That force was the feminine drive to affiliate with others, a drive scholars have described as the most gender-specific aspect of women's psychology.\\" When addressing the eight critical choices for women's success, Austin organizes a wealth of information and insight within eight highly informative chapters.<br />Austin concludes her final chapter with this observation: \\"Our commonality of values and ambitions may well make it easier to build lives of accomplishment as well as loving relationships, with deeper appreciation of our shared humanity.\\" I agree. One final point: Although Austin's perspectives are gender-specific, just about all of her advice would be of substantial value to males as well as to females. I am convinced that most human limitations are self-imposed. We hold ourselves back, perhaps convinced by others that we must do so. But obviously there are other limits such as those which result from gender discrimination. They are an obscene violation of our &quot;shared humanity&quot; and must be eliminated immediately.	2001-01-04

As this volume indicates, no other state is lovelier than Vermont. Few others have a more interesting historty. But as Lyman Orton correctly indicates in the Foreword, the reader can also &quot;take away some lessons about what determines land use, and what economic, social, cultural, and environmental consequences land-use choices may have.&quot; The reader is then urged to become involved in her or his community's efforts &quot;to define its future, while realizing that the future's scenarios are written by today's actions.&quot; True enough. What's at stake? Examine the wealth of photographs provided in Chapter 1 and in subsequent chapters. Such natural beauty could indeed be compromised...as it has already been in so many other areas throughout the United States.<br />By examining the almost 400-year history of the Vermont landscape, Chapters 2-5, Albers suggests that the values of  the past can be betrayed by what is done (and not done) now. Thus can the future be pre-determined, for better or worse. To have &quot;hands on the land&quot; is to have the power to determine its fate. That is as true of neighborhoods in the inner-city as it is of villages in Vermont. All are communities at risk.<br />Almost everyone will enjoy experiencing this beautiful as well as informative book. It is &quot;must reading&quot; for anyone involved in decisions which concern land use, and especially those decisions which have significant economic, social, cultural, and environmental consequences.	2000-12-29

They include a wealth of specific suggestions as well as real-world examples which suggest HOW to derive the greatest benefit, both from the system and the process. For whom will this book be most valuable? For experienced executives, it offers basic but useful reminders of what they probably know already (at least untuitively) or what they have learned empirically; for less-experienced executives, it offers what may well be new ideas, strategies, and tactics which can help to accelerate their career development.	2000-11-28

The &quot;thoughts on living&quot; which it shares  should not be viewed as gender-specific, especially today when there are so many single parents who must be both mother and father to their children. Some readers have found this book to be inspirational whereas others have found it thought-provoking. No doubt at least a few have found it &quot;cute&quot; or &quot;simplistic.&quot; I am grateful to Smith for sharing his own thoughts (many of them in the form of an aphorism) which he coordinates with thoughts from other sources, notably from the Holy Bible.<br />After I reading this book for a third time, I had a few thoughts of my own. First, that I wish my father had written down his own thoughts about various subjects (such as those listed in this book's Table of Contents) prior to his death. Also, that I should attempt to do that for my own sons and daughter...or at least audio-record those thoughts.  Will they be as inspiring, thought-provoking, etc. as those which Smith assembles in his book? Who cares? That's not the point.	2000-11-28

In this brilliantly written account, he again focuses on such people who -- often under the worst imaginable conditions -- achieved truly extraordinary results. It is probably impossible to measue with any degree of accuracy what the Transcontinental Railroad meant -- and continues to mean -- to the evolution of our nation. However, thanks to Ambrose, we have at least some sense of what it required of everyone involved.  Perhaps the greatest compliment a general reader can pay to the author of a history book is that it reads like a novel. In this instance, there is the value-added-benefit of being helped to understand the complexities (especially the perils) of a human enterprise of epic proportion. Albeit a highly respected hitorian and deservedly so, Ambrose is also his reader's companion throughout all manner of human adventures.	2000-11-27

I rate it so highly for two reasons: it seems to be the definitive biography of one of the most influential political leaders of the 20th century, and, it anchors its reader in an historical context within which Lenin's influence can be seen in a proper perspective. For me, Service answers two separate but related questions: Why Lenin rather than someone else? Also, what was his subsequent impact on what became the U.S.S.R.? While answering these two questions, Service also helps his reader to understand at least some of the forces which still have influence, not only on the former member states of the U.S.S.R. but also on the contemporary world with which they continue to interact.	2000-11-27

Hitler's was indeed a &quot;strange victory&quot; in that it made no sense to those who were fully prepared to fight World War One again.

(She apparently agrees with Derek Bok, former president of Harvard, when responding to irate parents after a tuition increase: \\"If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.\\") In her Introduction, she identifies three myths (or assumptions about the idea of knowledge sharing: (1) build it and they will come (the so-called \\"Field of Dreams Syndrome\\"), (2) technology can replace face-to-face, and (3) first you have to create a learning culture. \\"Many of the organizations I studied started with one or more of these assumptions and then had to make corrections to get back on track.\\" She then explains why each myth or assumption is either wrong or inadequate. After that, she observes: My major goal in writing this book is to broaden readers' thinking about how a company might share knowledge. Therefore I discuss many ways in which real companies have successfully transferred knowledge....Another goal is to help readers figure out which of these many systems [subsequently analyzed] would be most effective in their own settings -- how to tell whether BP's Peer Assist would be more effective than Ford's Best Practice Replication.\\" All this in the Introduction (!) which serves as the first of the nine chapters within which her material is organized.<br />The objective of Dixon's study of ten organizations (ranging from Bechtel to the U.S. Army) was to understand why some knowledge transfer systems are effective...and why others are not. Eventually, she concluded that \\"These organizations know a great deal about how...but much less about why.\\" Moreover, \\"Organizations like the ones I have written about in this book, that are on the leading edge of knowledge transfer have been learning on their own, primarily through trial and error.\\" To which I presume to add, that we must understand how to learn if any knowledge (about anything else) is to be gained. Moreover, there are also quite specific skills required when helping others to learn what we know. In her book, Dixon provides a wealth of information which includes cases and examples, a \\"synthesis that retains the separate voices of the examples\\", \\"stories\\" which preserve the emotions and values of people involved. general principles derived from the cases, and an \\"articulation\\" of the reasoning behind the various categories (eg absorptive capacity) inorder to reveal the WHY behind the categories.

In the networked world, what are the most serious digital security problems?<br />2. How can these problems be most effectively prevented?<br />3. How can these problems be most effectively detected?<br />4. Once detected, then what?<br />Here in a single volume is probably about all you need to know inorder to answer these and other critically important questions about digital security in the networked world.<br />According to Schneier, security systems have \\"several interesting properties\\" relevant to his book: They are complex; they interact with each other, forming even larger systems; they have emergent properties (ie they do what is not anticipated by designers or users); and they have bugs. In other words, security systems are (like those who design them and those who use them) imperfect. Schneier explains why security must be thought of as a system within larger systems. He examines the relationship between security theory and security practice. Also, he examines the relationships between and among prevention, detection, and reaction. Here is how the material is organized: Part I: The Landscape,  Part 2: Technologies, and Part 3: Strategies, followed by an Afterword and Resources.<br />In the Afterword, Schneier suggests that \\"the fundamental problems in security are no longer about technology; they're about how to use the technology...Both [this] book and [Schneier's] company grew from the same epiphany, that expert human detection and response provides the best possible security.\\" Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book?

Wise, Sr. (president 1895-1913, chairman1914-1917) until Frank Carlucci (chairman, 1999-present). What a colorful history it has been thus far.<br />My primary interest, however, is in the company today and (especially) in its prospects for the future inthe face of what is certain to be ferocious competition. As MacDonald observes in the Introduction, &quot;Nortel is at the forefront of laying down the information superhighways now revolutionizing the lives of everyone everywhere. Indeed, Nortel has a good-shot at becoming the number one provider of Internet infrastructure...This book, in providing a look at the emergence and prospects for Nortel, is, in part, an introduction to one of the biggest stories now unfolding: the fierce rivalry of three titans [ie Nortel, Cisco Systems, and Lucent Technologies] to construct and expand the networks of the future.&quot;<br />According to MacDonald, one of the main factors in the Nortel's success this far [i.e. when the book was published]  has been its ability to capitalize on discontinuities,&quot;those sudden breaks in the environment or the way things are done.&quot; For example, the transition from analog to digital telephonesystems, from wired to wireless communications, and from copper-based to fiber-optic transmission systems. Also, the deregulation of the telecommunications industry, allowance of interconnection to the telephone network by the FCC (1971), and then the break-up of the AT&amp;T monopoly. MacDonald does a brilliant job of examining and explaining this theme of discontinuities as well as other themes which also relate to &quot;the role of institutional arrangements&quot; and to &quot;the internal dynamics of the corporation.&quot;<br />As he thinks about  an uncertain future, MacDonald suggests how Nortel has differentiated itself thus far from its two main rivals: its lead infiber optics, the relatively greater amount of its research anddevelopment, its greater diversification of both product andgeographic distribution, its speed advantage over Lucent to embrace growth opportunities of the Internet and IP networks, and through the leveraging of its strengths in optical transmission. Of course, how long Nortel can sustain these competitive advantages remained to be seen then and serious problems have since developed or have at least been revealed.<br />Who will derive the greatest benefit from reading this book? All of the executives now employed by Nortel, Cisco, and Lucent as well as by other &quot;players&quot; such as Siemens, Alcatel, and Ericsson. Also, all of the executives at other companies which now have (or seek) B2B relationships with any of the aforementioned &quot;giants.&quot; Finally, other executives such as I who are not directly involved but are eager nonetheless to learn how and why some companies become &quot;giants&quot; (at least for a time) and others don't. I am deeply grateful to MacDonald for what I have learned from his book and thank him, also, for presenting his material with style,grace, and (when appropriate) a sense of humor.ld suggests how Nortel has differentiated itself thus far from its two main rivals: its lead infiber optics, the relatively greater amount of its research anddevelopment, its greater diversification of both product andgeographic distribution, its speed advantage over Lucent to embrace growth opportunities of the Internet and IP networks, and through the leveraging of its strengths in optical transmission.

Smith and Dalzell identify \\"enduring lessons from Rockefeller, Morgan, and [others among] the first industrialists.\\" The term \\"Robber Barons\\" suggests criminal monarchs. No doubt it has some direct relevance to those discussed, at least at some point in their respective business careers. The material is organized as follows: an excellent Introduction (\\"Why Robber Barons Matter\\") followed by four chapters (Venturing, Competing, Managing, and Leading). Then there is a handy section called \\"Chronology: Business and World Events, 1870-1929,'&quot; followed by recommendations for \\"Further Reading.\\"<br />Why do the Robber Barons matter? \\"During the golden age of industry, running from the midnineteenth century through 1930 or so, the Robber Barons commercialized  risky high technologies and figured out how to build radically new organizations from the bottom up. They identified the great entrepreneurial and management issues of the world's first big corporations, and they devised surprisingly durable solutions to the basic business problems of modern civilization.\\" Here are a few of the quotations which caught my eye:<br />\\"There could be no progress until enough people could be made dissatisfied -- and this could be done only when they were brought to think beyond the limits to which they were accustomed.\\" (Thomas Edison)<br />\\"If you have an idea, that is good. If you also have ideas as to how to work it out, that is better.\\" (Henry Ford)<br />\\"Every executive has to recognize sooner or later that he himself cannot do everything that needs to be done. Until he recognizes this, he is only an individual, with an individual's power, but after he recognizes it, he becomes, for the first time, an executive, with control of multiple powers.\\" (Alfred Sloan)<br />The authors have done an excellent job of selecting and distributing quotations such as these throughout the text.

In the Preface, he explains that this book \\"is about changing the world. It is about coming to a deep understanding of human beings and human relationships.\\" He then adds, \\"The book focuses on vision, unconditional confidence, and profound impact. It is about the mastery of human influence, transformational power, and the capacity to accomplish extraordinary things. It argues that everyone of us is a change agent.\\" It is important to add, that Quinn advocates \\"deep change\\" as opposed to \\"incremental change.\\" Moreover, no organization can achieve deep change unless and until those within that organization achieve deep change. So as I understand it, each of us must assume full authority as well as responsibility for (and have control of) our personal development. \\"There is a language of transformation. Yet most of us are cut off from that language. All our lives we have been explicitly taught to see human influence as an exercise in domination.\\" Even the most sensitive among us is shaped by this paradigm or worldview. But this outlook prevents us from seeing more deeply into the actual workings of human systems. This book demonstrates an alternative system.\\"<br />Quinn recalls the remark by Oliver Wendell Holmes that he placed little value in simplicity that lay on this side of complexity but a great deal of value on simplicity that lay on the other side. The framework within which Quinn presents his material comes from the \\"seed thoughts\\" of people who have mastered \\"the language of transformation.\\" By \\"seed thoughts\\" Quinn means some of the \\"core notions that masters of transformation hold in common, the simplicity they send us from the other side of complexity.\\" Specifically, Jesus, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr.<br />Quinn focuses on eight (8) \\"seed thoughts\\" (eg Envision the Productive Community, First Look Within, Embrace the Hypocritical Self), providing brief quotations from each of the three \\"masters of transformation\\" which he correlates with each of the eight \\"seed thoughts.\\" His objective is to explain how Advanced Change Theory (ACT) can enable individuals to achieve deep change in their own lives and then within their organizations. The title of this book (Change the World) may be somewhat misleading. I wholeheartedly agree with Quinn that \\"ordinary people can accomplish extraordinary results\\", both individually and as members of a group. I also agree that Jesus, Gandhi, and King were \\"masters of transformation\\" within their respective spheres of influence as were Carnegie, Edison, Ford, Morgan, and Rockefeller within their own. Quinn's basic idea is sound. He and I may differ only when defining terms such as \\"change\\" and \\"world.\\"<br />I urge you to read this book, to consider very carefully what ACT offers to you (personally) and to your organization, and then to select whatever is most appropriate. Quinn provides an eloquent and convincing argument in support of his concept of deep change; better yet, he suggests all manner of strategies and tactics to achieve and sustain it; even better yet, almost anyone who reads this book already has the resources required. If you need help to organize and allocate those resources, and truly powerful encouragement to support your efforts in process, look no further.ok Within, Embrace the Hypocritical Self), providing brief quotations from each of the three \\"masters of transformation\\" which he correlates with each of the eight \\"seed thoughts.\\" His objective is to explain how Advanced Change Theory (ACT) can enable individuals to achieve deep change in their own lives and then within their organizations.

Deep Change provides an appropriate introduction to any one of them. I value his books so highly because they make substantial contributions to our understanding of HOW to achieve and then sustain meaningful change, both in our personal lives and in our organizations.<br /><br />According to Quinn, \\"Incremental change is usually the result of a rational analysis and planning process. There is a desired goal with a specific set of steps for reaching it. Incremental change is usually limited in scope and often reversible. If the change does not work out, we can always return to the old way. Incremental change usually does not disrupt our past patterns -- it is an extension of the past. Most important, during incremental change, we feel we are in control.\\" Does all this sound familiar? Has Quinn described accurately how change occurs within your organization?<br /><br />Now consider a second brief excerpt: \\"This book explores a much more difficult change process, the process of deep change. Deep change differs from incremental change in that it requires new ways of thinking and behaving. It is change that is major in scope, discontinuous with the past and generally irreversible. The deep change effort distorts existing patterns of action and involves taking risks. Deep change means surrendering control.\\" Decades ago, David Riesman made the helpful distinction between \\"inner-directed\\" and \\"other-directed\\" people. The same can also be said of organizations (communities of people) when determining the nature, extent, and location of control. Quinn believes that \\"one person can change the larger system or organization in which he or she exists.\\" If I understand Quinn correctly, his central assertion is this: If and only if enough individuals achieve deep change individually can their shared organization then achieve deep change.<br /><br />This is a very dangerous concept. Unlike incremental change, deep change poses a very serious threat to the status quo of an organization and, especially, to those who (you can be certain) will steadfastly defend it. There will also be perils for those who seek to achieve deep change in their individual lives. Cherished assumptions, premises, values, and beliefs will all be called into question and many of them will be found inadequate, if not false. As Quinn describes it, those undergoing deep change will feel as if they are \\"walking naked into the land of uncertainty.\\" He acknowledges \\"This is usually a terrifying choice, often involving a 'dark night of the soul.'\\"  In Riesman's view, that person becomes inner-directed. For Quinn, that person is \\"internally driven...more capable of leading under conditions of continuous change...more organic.\\"<br /><br />What is the alternative? Quinn's answer: \\"slow death.\\" I am reminded of a relevant insight expressed by Ernest Becker in The Denial of Death. He acknowledges that no one can deny physical death but there is another death which anyone can deny: the death which occurs when we become wholly preoccupied with fulfilling others' expectations of us. A slow death indeed. If you wish to achieve deep change in your life, and are now involved in an organization which can only tolerate incremental change (if any change at all), I urge you to find another organization.e incremental change, deep change poses a very serious threat to the status quo of an organization and, especially, to those who (you can be certain) will steadfastly defend it.

Even with various aids provided within software (eg to correct spelling), basic mistakes of grammar go undetected...and &quot;send the wrong message&quot; (both literally and symbolically) to recipients of  what you write. Inside the front cover, the authors provide an especially handy detailed index (for questions concerning writing, grammar, effective sentences, diction, punctuation, and mechanics as well as glossaries of usage and terms) which directs their reader to the appropriate page or pages in the Handbook; on the back inside cover of the book, they then provide an equally handy list of checklists (also with page references) followed by a list of revision symbols. There are several such reference resources which will serve you well. In my opinion, this is the most comprehensive...and the easiest to use on a regular basis.

Specifically, what he calls the Horizontal Organization \\"organizes around core process groups. All the people who work on a core process are brought together into a group that can easily coordinate its efforts and maximize the value of of what it delivers to customers.\\" It differs from other models in that it is more comprehensive by incorporating \\"elements of some of the existing concepts, such as process reengineering, individual empowerment, and teams. But it goes beyond them by providing an overall framework for the organization that integrates and makes use of the best of these ideas in a new structure that has been proved in practice.\\" So, Ostroff's intention is to help his reader understand what the Horizontal Organization is, how it works, how it can be developed, and how to decide where it can be effectively employed in any organization.<br />I rate this book so highly, not because it provides THE answers but because Ostroff asks what I consider to be the important questions as all of us proceed into an uncertain future. There are so many paradigm shifts occurring simultaneously. Words such as \\"organization\\" and \\"customer\\" seem to be redefined constantly, as are the concepts of \\"leader\\" and \\"manager\\" as well as \\"core business\\" and \\"competitive marketplace.\\" Of course, despite what his book's subtitle suggests, Ostroff is well aware of all this. He thinks clearly, writes well, and in his concluding remarks indicates a proper respect for \\"buy in\\" throughout any organization., asserting that \\"the change effort itself and the new organization born from the old must have full top-down, bottom-up, cross-functional commitment. If done right, the integration of the fundamental principles of the horizontal organization will inspire the people in your organization, supercharge their performance, and create a winning value proposition that lifts your organization far above the competition.\\"tal principles of the horizontal organization will inspire the people in your organization, supercharge their performance, and create a winning value proposition that lifts your organization far above the competition.\\"	2000-11-18

Throughout the book, Travis provides numerous insights which I found thought-provoking. For example:<br />* \\"A brand is more than a symbol.

Leaders develop, contribute and make a difference in the lives of their employees, community, customers, and shareowners -- each and every day. Leaders are not found everywhere, but countless numbers are in pursuit of an excellence leading towards World's Best Value.\\" As this brief excerpt correctly indicates, there really isn't much that is new in this book.  And frankly, I was irritated by the constant repetition of \\"World's Best Value in bold face throughout the book and struggled to suppress my irritation while trying to absorb and digest the book's contents. In fact, the material is solid, presented with a crisp prose style. Faw views this book as \\"a simplification of complex business system perspectives...a guidepost for business survival and long-term success.\\" That is an accurate description.<br />In Chapter 1, he suggests the characteristics of (here we go again) the \\"World's Best Value:<br />* World-class products and services<br />* Best practices, business and information systems<br />* High-performance team members<br />* Low-cost values<br />* Total quality management culture<br />* Intensive global customer focus<br />* Principled centered leadership<br />Once again, nothing new. However, with this initial chapter, Faw creates an appropriate context within which to present follow-up material (on each of the aforfementioned subjects) in the succeeding 15 chapters. He does become overheated at times (eg \\"If you're not changing the world, you're taking up space!\\") but, on balance, the material is sound and his discussion of it is lucid as well as well as sensible.	2000-11-16

Actually, this is a two-books-in-one volume: an insightful explanation of how to increase personal as well as professional development, and, an uncommonly useful book on marketing. Rating either, I would give it Four Stars. Ranking the combination, I rate it higher. Abraham promises to provide \\"21 Ways You Can Out-Think, Out-Perform, and Out-Earn the Competition.\\" He delivers on that promise. If fully understood and properly applied, the 21 \\"ways\\" (actually strategies) will help almost everyone to become a better person as well as to increase the value of what they produce; perhaps indirectly but significantly, their business associates as well as family members can also be among the beneficiaries.<br />Abraham organizes his material within 21 chapters. Correctly, he first addresses the need for a plan (\\"Where You're Headed -- an Overview of Your Journey\\") and then the need for the proper attitude to ensure the success of that plan (\\"You Can Become Unbeatable\\"). By the final chapter, he has prepared his reader to understand what he calls a \\"unique definition of success.\\" Specifically, \\"something I call optimum personal, business, and career strategy. What's this mean? It means that you must refuse to get less out of an effort, less out of an opportunity, less out of a day, less out of a dollar, less out of a relationship, than the maximum that activity or action has the capacity to give. It means that you don't do things just to be doing them. That you insist on playing life to the fullest. But playing it based on your sense of value.\\"...You [first] have to figure out who you are and what it is you want.\\"<br />Obviously, Abraham cannot figure out who you are but the 21 \\"ways\\" he shares can help you to make that determination. He cannot tell you what it is you want but the same 21 \\"ways\\" can help you to make that determination, also. Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book? One candidate would be the recent graduate for whom this would be an especially valuable holiday gift. Also, your less-experienced business associates who seem to lack a sense of purpose and/or direction in their lives, jobs, and careers. Finally, just about anyone else for whom most of what Abraham suggests seems \\"obvious\\" but would benefit from the human equivalent of a vehicle's 60,000-mile check-up. Abraham knows a lot. He has street smarts. Also passion, conviction, and a remarkable amount of empathy.<br />Years ago, Woody Allen once suggested that 80% of success is \\"showing up.\\" For many people, Abraham suggests the other 20%: Knowing who you are and then being that person...knowing what you want and then pursuing it with energy and integrity.

Master these basics and you will be better equipped to build an organization that can respond rapidly to complex and diverse challenges, in a distributed and self-coordinating way.\\"<br />Clippinger serves as editor of ten separate but related essays, and, as the author of two of them. One of the most interesting concepts (discussed by Clippinger in the book's first chapter) is the \\"The Sweet Spot Between Excessive Disorder and Excessive Order.\\" With Darwin's theory of Natural Selection in mind, Clippinger suggests that \\"The challenge to all forms of complex organization, from the simplest proteins to the most complex societies, is to survive in the particular `fitness landscape' in which they find themselves. In the starkest terms, the challenge of survival is that of searching an enormous landscape, or space of options, in sufficient time to avoid extinction.\\" In times such as these when change is the only constant, it follows that the \\"sweet spot\\" is mobile; how we define \\"excessive\\" disorder and disorder today, therefore, may well be inadequate (if not dead wrong) tomorrow.<br />In the final chapter, \\"Emergent Law and Order: Lessons in Regulation, Dispute Resolution, and Lawmaking for Electronic Commerce and Community\\", David R. Johnson has some especially informative comments on the subjects indicated by the chapter's title. If change is the only constant,  if measurements of \\"excessive\\" order and \\"disorder\\" are themselves volatile, what hope is there for organizations which must compete in such an environment? Johnson observes: \\"The lawmaker and dispute resolver of today must be more gardener than sovereign, building a trellis, grafting new plants, fertilizing open ground. The wise ones, who know they can only water and weed, not manufacture or command, will be rewarded with the knowledge that their actions will lead to a richer social and economic harvest.\\"<br />Don't be misled. This brief excerpt is not from the script for the film Being There in which the mentally-challenged character played by Peter Sellers unknowingly suggests correlations between agriculture and economics. Johnson's metaphors are apt and highly sophisticated, correctly suggesting all manner of complex and profound implications which can be derived from the aforementioned \\"underlying principles\\" which comprise \\"the seven basic elements\\" outlined by Holland. If your organization needs help with \\"decoding the natural laws of enterprise\\", I highly recommend the essays so carefully organized withn this book.aker and dispute resolver of today must be more gardener than sovereign, building a trellis, grafting new plants, fertilizing open ground.

I should add that some of the specific titles are probably not readily available anywhere else. For example, J.C. Penney's \\"Six Principles for Winning\\", Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield's \\"Our Aspirations\\", and Al Neuharth's \\"An S.O.B.'s Ten Secrets to Success.\\" This would make a terrific holiday gift for your business associates, customers, etc. but also (especially) for recent or imminent graduates who are committed to a career in business.<br />Please do not ignore Krass's Introduction.

What sets this one apart is suggested by its subtitle: \\"How Japanese Companies Create the Dynamics of Innovation.\\" Decades ago, Japanese executives embraced and acted upon Deming's ideas about TQM. Only after many years later was Deming properly appreciated by corporate leaders in the United States. The same cannot be said about knowledge management (KM) and its most prominent advocates in the United States, such as Peter Senge. Nonetheless, there is much of value we can learn about KM from the Japanese.<br />According to the authors, \\"the success of Japanese companies is not due to their manufacturing process; access to cheap capital; close and cooperative relationships with customers, suppliers, and government agencies; or lifetime employment, seniority system, and other human resources management practices....Instead, we make the claim that Japanese companies have been successful because of their skills and expertise at `organizational knowledge creation'. By organizational knowledge creation, we mean the capability of a company as a whole to create new knowledge, disseminate it throughout the organization, and embody it in products, services, and systems.\\"<br />The material is carefully organized and developed within eight chapters:<br />1. Introduction to Knowedge in organizations<br />2. Knowledge and Management<br />3. Theory of Organizational Knowledge Creation<br />4. Creating Knowledge in Practice<br />5. Middle-up-down Management Practice<br />6. A New Organizational Structure<br />7. Global Organizational Knowledge Creation<br />8. Managerial and Theoretical Implications<br />The chapters which I found most thought-provoking are 1, 3, and 8 but all are valuable. I agree with the authors that innovation can be (and is) achieved \\"by continuously creating new knowledge, disseminating it widely through the organization, and embodying it quickly in new technologies, products, and systems.\\" I further agree that knowledge-creation \\"is no longer an enigma. ..[nor is the] process endemic to Japanese companies. It is universal.\\" Leaders of any organization (regardless of its size, nature, or national identity) can derive great benefit from this book, one whose primary models and benchmarks may be limited to companies in only one country but whose relevance is indeed \\"universal.\\".\\" I further agree that knowledge-creation \\"is no longer an enigma. ..[nor is the] process endemic to Japanese companies.

(I refer to the revised and expanded version.) The authors discuss 40 countries (in alphabetical order, from Argentina to Venezuela), then provide five appendices: Contracts and Websites, Documents Used in International Trade, Abbreviations of International Organizations, Corruption &amp; Bribery Index, and Conversion Factors. I am now convinced that almost every company throughout the world will eventually become involved, directly or indirectly, with e-business. Here is a comprehensive guide which contains invaluable information and hard-headed recommendations based on real-world experience.

According to the authors, the title refers to five thought patterns which are central to the success of any leader: the capacity to examine and appraise their own behavior and impact on others; the strategy of interpreting negative events with a resilient inner narrative and response; the practice of setting aide false assumptions, reversing roles, and learning from everyone in the organization; the ability to trust, value, and speak from their own experience; and finally, the craft of counterpoint, that is, restoring perspective and renewing resources. \\"This book is for people who are in charge of an organization and for those who want to be. We hope that each of you will recognize your experiences in learning to lead. Whether you are a leader or a leader-to-be, this book demonstrates how to draw upon your life's rich legacy [ie the family template, the world as teacher, and the moments of meaning] and to turn the challenges in your work into opportunities for leadership.\\"<br />The authors organize their excellent material within two Parts: The Legacy of Leaders, and, Habits of Mind: The Resources to Inform and Invigorate Leadership. They interviewed 65 leaders inorder to understand how relationships and experiences in each leader's past influenced her or his experience of meeting the challenges of being in charge. Responses varied of course, sometimes dramatically, but all of the leaders seem to share most (if not all) of the aforementioned five thought patterns. I was fascinated to learn (a) how each leader drew upon inner resources, (b) what the results were, and (c) what each leader learned from the process.<br />Although Mackoff and Wenet suggest that their book was written for leaders and leaders-to-be, I think it will also be valuable for everyone else within an organization who now claims to have no ambition to become one. Perhaps, after reading this thoughtful and practical book, at least some of them will reconsider their career objectives. I sincerelky hope many do. All organizations need effective leadership at all levels. FYI, Tichy and Cohen discuss this specific need in The Leadership Engine. I also highly recommend O'Toole's Leadership A to Z.<br />Mackoff and Wenet conclude with one of my favorite quotations from the works of Soren Kierkegaard: &quot;Life is understood backward, but lived forward.&quot; The inner work  of leaders is to learn from what has already been experienced so that such knowledge can be applied to whatever has yet to be accomplished. This book is not only about leading effectively...it is also about living fully, guided and informed by wisdom.hope many do. All organizations need effective leadership at all levels.

Before getting into the book's text, I reviewed the Contents. My response was, \\"You've got to be kidding!\\" Then in Part I, Nicholas claims that certain \\"magic words\\" can get anyone anything she or he wants in life (!). After reading Part I, I was unconvinced. However, have no doubt about it, Nicholas is not kidding.  He is absolutely convinced that the right words in the right combination within the right context (shared with the right person at the right time in the right format) can achieve exceptional results. I agree.<br />I think this book will be especially valuable for organizations which have severely limited (if any) funds to spend on \\"outside sources\\" while needing more effective communications (eg direct mail, brochures, newsletters, and scripts for \\"cold calls\\"). It will also be valuable for most other organizations whose \\"messages\\" to their respective constituencies lack clarity and (more importantly) do not have the desired impact.<br />Nicholas' enthusiasm is contagious. His advice is sound. He offers an abundance of examples of what is and isn't effective. He also explains why. Will this book enable ANYONE to accomplish ANYTHING? No. But for those who read it with great care and then apply its principles with even greater care, it can be invaluable. Of that I am convinced. One final point: I am reminded of what John Hill said many years ago when defining public relations as being \\"truth well told.\\" Words and phrases have no \\"magic\\" unless what they communicate is authentic and thus has credibility. Even Nicholas could not effectively promote (or conceal) a defective product or shoddy service. Be the very best at what you do. No matter what you offer for sale, make a total commitment to sustaining standards of the highest quality. Then let Nicholas help you to tell a truthful story of who you are and of what you offer...and to tell that story well.ment to sustaining standards of the highest quality.

Ferling brilliantly analyzes all three towering figures within a specific historical context, to be sure, but also in terms of each other. He creates and then explores a matrix of juxtapositions between and among them, comparing and contrasting all three in relation to each other but also in relation to the historical context on which each had such a profound impact. What Ferling has created is both a history book of panoramic scope and a trilogy of interrelated (and to some extent interdependent) biographies. It is so well-written that I often thought I was reading a novel.<br />Since childhood, I have viewed certain books as \\"magic carpets.\\" I include Ferling's book among them. It transported me back more than 200 years and deposited me amidst the brave and brilliant men  who were about to set the world \\"ablaze\\" with their incendiary passion for an independence soon to be declared and eventually to be achieved. Ferling guides his reader through this highly combustible process. Of special interest to me is Ferling's presentation of Adams (characterized as the \\"Bulwark\\" of the American Revolution), a founding father not always mentioned in the same breath with Washington and Jefferson. With all due respect to Jefferson's accomplishments, Ferling concludes the final chapter with this observation: \\"To the end, he was incapable of accepting the reality of his culpability in the perpetuation and expansion of African slavery and the danger it now posed to the achievements of the American Revolution.\\" And then in the Epilogue, Ferling asserts that the Revolutionary generation \\"was indeed fortunate to have had Washington and Adams as its greatest stewards and shepherds.\\"<br />If you have a keen interest in the War for Independence and, especially, in those who led the new nation through and beyond that war, there is this magic carpet I know about....	2000-11-15

Michael Lewis makes a substantial contribution to our efforts to understand what is happening now in today's business world...and what is likely to occur next. His is \\"a Silicon Valley story.\\" As such, it has the obligatory plot and characters as well as a number of themes which he carefully develops. The net result is both informative and entertaining.<br />Exactly what is \\"the new new thing\\"? This moment's answer may be wrong by the time you finish reading this sentence. Really? Yes really. Especially in the Silicon Valley, the next \\"new new thing\\" is the 21st century's equivalent of the Holy Grail. The problem is, as Lewis carefully explains, it is  often an illusion..and even when manifest, it can so quickly become obsolete. \\"Silicon Valley to the United States what the United States is to the rest of the world.\\" What is that? Briefly, \\"the capital of innovation, of material prosperity, of a certain kind of energy, of certain kinds of freedom, and of transience.\\" Wow! As I soon discovered when reading the first few chapters, Lewis has written a literary hybrid: it combines the dominant features of the picaresque novel (featuring a central character who seeks and experiences a series of adventures) with the sequential essay (separate but interdependent discussions of a common subject). Lewis' central character is called \\"the searcher\\": He who seeks the \\"new thing\\" conforms to no well-established idea of what people should do for a living gropes. Finding the new thing is as much a matter of timing as of technical or financial aptitude, though both of those qualities help.\\" Lewis follows the searcher (indeed several) inorder to examine -- and understand -- a process which creates \\"fantastic wealth\\" in the Silicon Valley. The searcher is a \\"disruptive force\\" as he gropes his way along, constantly on the move...his mind much more quickly than his feet, preferring to live perpetually \\"with that sweet tingling discomfort of not quite knowing what what it is he wants to say. It is one of the little ironies of economic progress that, while it often results in greater levels of comfort, it depends on people who prefer not to get too comfortable.\\" The searcher, for example.<br />Are we to believe that people who grope their way through life, wandering through the Silicon Valley, are playing a major role (a wholly new role) in wealth creation? Exactly. (This is a mentality and a behavior which Guy Claxton discusses so well in Hair Brain Tortoise Mind.) The main character of this story \\"had a structure to his life. He might not care to acknowledge it, but it was there all the same. It was the structure of an old-fashioned adventure story. His mere presence on a scene inspired the question that propels every adventure story forward: What will happen next? I had no idea. And neither, really, did he.\\"<br />Throughout this book, as Lewis casually but precisely tells his \\"story\\", we are introduced to some of the most successful  residents of the Silicon Valley. Jim Clark, for example, who proves to be the central character. For Lewis, Clark embodies \\"a vast paradigm shift in American culture\\" from conventional models and visions of success toward an entirely new way of thinking about the world and control of it. Central to Lewis' discussion of Clark is Clark's sailboat Hyperion, the world's tallest single-mast vessel. There seems to be a progressive pattern of symbiotic relationships: United States &lt; &gt; Silicon Valley &lt; &gt; the searcher &lt; &gt; Jim Clark &lt; &gt; Netscape &lt; &gt; Healtheon &lt; &gt; Hyperion &lt; &gt; ? Revealingly, in Lewis' Epilogue, we are told that Clark has already begun work on the design of a new sailboat.  \\"Hyperion was nice, but this...this was the perfect boat.\\" At least for now.<br />What Lewis reveals is a restless mentality in constant search of the next \\"new new thing.\\" His focal point may be Clark but, in my opinion, he is really examining a global economy in the 21st century which will continueto be driven by that mentality. There will always be a newer, better browser...a newer, better sailboat...a newer, better whatever. Men and women unknown to us now are \\"groping\\" to find them. And eventually they will...but will not then be satisfiede to be driven by that mentality. There will always be a newer, better browser...a newer, better sailboat...a newer, better whatever. Men and women unknown to us now are \\"groping\\" to find them. And eventually they will...but will not then be satisfied	2000-11-14

The objective is really not survival; rather, to achieve and then sustain a position of dominance or at least primacy. In business, obviously, there is an on-going process of \\"natural selection\\" which determines which companies are sufficiently fit and which are not. Schwartz is dead-on when suggesting that it is a \\"logical\\" process: \\"Fear naturally gave way to experimentation....Successful experimentation soon led to confidence....Confidence inspired trust....Trust led to faith...Faith led to mass acceptance.\\"<br />Schwartz devotes a separate chapter to each of the seven \\"breakthrough strategies\\":<br />Build a Brand that Stands for Solving Problems<br />Allow Your Prices to Fluctuate Freely with Supply and Demand<br />Let Affiliate Partners Do Your Marketing for You<br />Create Valuable Bundles of Information and Services<br />Sell Custom-Made Products Online, Then [italics] Manufacture Them<br />Add New Value to Transactions Between Buyers and Sellers<br />Integrate Digital Commerce with Absolutely Everything<br />Obviously, with all due respect to Schwartz's excellent insights and suggestions, it remains for you to determine (1) which of these (and other) strategies are most relevant to the specific needs of your own organization, and (2), the nature and extent of resources which can be allocated to their implementation. Also, obviously, as needs change (and they will), the combination of strategies must be modified to accommodate them. One final point: Whatever the initiatives may be,  it is imperative to have \\"buy in\\" throughout your organization by everyone involved, from top to bottom. Otherwise, your organization will be eliminated by a \\"natural selection\\" process measured in years and even weeks, not centuries or even years.	2000-11-13

What if the Normandy Invasion (D Day) had failed in 1944? Your guess is as good as mine but the guesses of eminent historians are much better. Specifically, David McCullough, James M. McPherson, and Stephen E. Ambrose, respectively, who ask \\"What if?\\" in reference to these key situations in military history. Others speculate on, for example, \\"The Immolation of Hernan Cortes\\" (1521), \\"The Repulse of the British Fireships\\" (1588), \\"How Hitler Could Have Won\\" (1941), and \\"China Without Tears\\" (1946). Robert Crowley has done a masterful job of editing this anthology of essays. You may disagree with many of the answers to the repeatedly asked question \\"What if?\\" but I am certain you will be entertained as well as informed while reading this splendid book.

The change required from pre-Internet times is profound....Then, in the third section, the authors look at some fundamental business practices and give us some guidance in adapting traditional business concepts to the Internet world.

Fitz-enz adds substantially to his international renown with this more recent book in which he suggests all manner of ways to measure the economic value of human capital. In the Preface, he suggests that (in business terms) human capital be described as a combination of factors such as these:<br />* The traits one brings to the job: intelligence, energy, a generally positive attitude, reliability, commitment<br />* One's ability to learn: aptitude, imagination, creativity, and what is often called street smarts\\", savvy (for how to get things done)<br />* One's motivation to share information and knowledge: team spirit and goal orientation<br />As Fitz-enz then explains, Chapter 1 takes the first steps toward a methodology for measuring the return on investment (ROI) of human capital. Chapter 2 launches the process of finding the ROI of human capital from an unusual \\"starting point\\": rather than begin with process improvement at the lower organizational levels, focus at the highest possible levels on \\"the goals of the enterprise.\\" Chapter 3 is the \\"bridge\\" between the enterprise and the human capital management levels. Chapter 4 brings us to \\"the drivers of all enterprise success\\": people.\\" Chapter 5 integrates the three levels (enterprise, process or function, and people), combining them \\"in one end-to-end system of human capital valuation reporting.\\" Chapter 6 moves to the next level: trending and predicting. Chapter 7 dissects five of the most common human resources and human capital initiatives, demonstrating HOW to find economic value in the workings of each. Chapter 8 reports on two of the longest-term, largest-scale studies of human capital management. Chapter 9 explains what is required for an organization to take a quantum leap\\" over its competition. Chapter 10 provides a \\"compilation&quot; of eleven &quot;guiding principles\\" which serve as &quot;The Foundation Stones of the Human Capital Measurement Pathway.&quot; And then in the final chapter, Fitz-enz brilliantly sums up the basic measurement system. Note in particular Figure 11-1 (\\"Composite human capital scoreboard\\") which provides an excellent model to guide and inform the efforts of any organization, regardless of its size or nature.<br />With very few exceptions, an organization's greatest assets do indeed \\"walk out the door\\" at the end of each business day. For those who are eager to measure human capital more accurately, who then wish to create for their organization a much greater return on investments in its human resources, this is an absolutely indispensable resource to help achieve those objectives.l Measurement Pathway.&quot; And then in the final chapter, Fitz-enz brilliantly sums up the basic measurement system.

In fact, all of the 100 \\"laws of business success\\" which Tracy identifies are broken every day. That's precisely his point: Success awaits those who understand them and follow them; failure awaits those who do not. \\"The purpose of this book is to share with you a system of proven principles, or `laws,' that have been discovered and rediscovered, practiced and implemented, by the most successful business people everywhere, in every kind of organization, large and small, throughout the history of business enterprise. The practice of these laws will give you the winning edge.\\" Tracy organizes his material as follows:<br /><br />Chapter One: -- The [5] Laws of Life (e.g. Cause and Effect)<br /><br />Chapter Two -- The [14] Laws of Success (e.g. Forced Efficiency)<br /><br />Chapter Three -- The [14] Laws of Business (e.g. Critical Success Factors)<br /><br />Chapter Four -- The [12] Laws of Leadership (e.g. Empathy)<br /><br />Chapter Five -- The [13] Laws of Money (e.g. Accelerating Acceleration)<br /><br />Chapter Six -- The [15] Laws of Selling (e.g.  Positioning)<br /><br />Chapter Seven -- The [14] Laws of Negotiating (e.g. Win-Win or No Deal)<br /><br />Chapter Eight -- The [13] Laws of Time Management (e.g. Sequentiality)<br /><br />Tracy discusses each of these 100 \\"Laws\\" and also includes several \\"corollaries.\\" My guess is that many of the Laws (if not most of them) are already familiar to you. In that event, they have value as reminders. What I found most valuable is Tracy's grouping of them in subject-specific clusters (e.g. The Laws of Negotiating after The Laws of Selling); also, his use of sequences, from one Chapter to another, from one Law to another. Personally, I view the Laws as Guidelines which can help to inform and then direct appropriate decisions in all manner of situations. Also, as I think Tracy would agree, they will be effective if (huge \\"if\\") sustained by a firm commitment throughout the given enterprise by everyone involved. As one old adage suggests, \\"If you don't care where you're going, any road will get you there.\\" It has a corollary: \\"If you don't care what happens, anything you do (or don't do) won't make any difference anyway.\\"e you're going, any road will get you there.\\" It has a corollary: \\"If you don't care what happens, anything you do (or don't do) won't make any difference anyway.\\"	2000-11-13

In the Introduction, he asks \\"So who are the new power brokers in the corporate e-commerce market? How are they using online business-to-business applications to turn their annual ledgers from red to black? What do their award-winning Web sites look like? And what's in store for the commercial online industry in years to come?\\" To answer these basic (and imperative) questions, O'Connell draws upon a wealth of information which includes new ideas germinating in small cubicles, and on corporate drawing boards nationwide, feedback from online discount suppliers and dozens of online experts, revelations within real-life case studies, and what he calls \\"infoboxes, sidebars, and colorful industry profiles.\\" Lots of good stuff.<br />In the final chapter, O'Connell shares some especially interesting forecasts. For example:<br />*  According to the Gartner Group, in the run up to 2003, almost 75% of European companies will under budget e-business transformation costs.<br />* According to Forrester Research, one-third of all Europeans will use the Net via mobile phones in 2004.<br />* According to a research study conducted by PriceWaterhouseCoopers in 1999, 67% of Asian CEOs stated that they believe that e-business will have a significant impact on competition in their industries, while 47% stated they believe financial services will be the sector most significantly impacted by the Internet in the next two years.<br />This book will be especially valuable to small-to-midsize companies with relatively limited resources. O'Connell suggests all manner of strategies and tactics to assist them when setting up (or improving) an e-business Web site; where to locate and what to learn from the hottest B2B sites; how to market e-business; and how to use e-business to create value-added benefits for suppliers, partners, customers, employees, etc. If any of this is of immediate and urgent importance to you and to your own company, obtain and read a copy ASAP. Better yet, have the other key people in your organization also read it, then conduct an off-site 2-3 day workshop with the book setting the agenda for group discussion. By the workshop's conclusion, the group should have formulated a game plan which must then be implemented with passion as well as precision.

I agree. Her greatest accomplishments include:<br /> The establishment of the Church of  England (in 1559)<br /> Re-establishment of the authority of the British crown at a time when other monarchies were deteriorating<br /> Re-establishment of English coinage after the nation's near (and total) bankruptcy<br /> Support of exploratory voyages (by Drake and Raleigh) in the New World to lay what eventually became the foundation of the British Empire<br /> Support of the cultural arts during what is now regarded as England's &quot;Golden Age&quot; (ie the Elizabethan Age) of literature, theater, and music<br /> Survival of all manner of foreign threats (eg invasion by the Spanish armada in 1588) as well as domestic conspiracies (e.g. numerous assassination attempts)<br />These and other accomplishments are explained by her intelligence, commitment, tenacity, charisma, style,grace, and charm. Also by her almost ferocious determination. Also by what the authors characterize as her brilliant use of &quot;pragmatic delays.&quot; It is also worth noting that she led an all-male government with an androgynous style designed to transcend gende rissues. Moreover, throughout her reign, she sustained direct and frequent contact with her subjects at all social levels throughout the realm. Perhaps no other monarch in history was loved more.<br />The authors organize their material within 12 chapters whose subjects are indeed relevant to the our own business world: Leadership, Managing Finances, the Art of Spin, Team Building, Vision-Mission-Commitment, Decision-Making, Vast Intellect, Style, Gender Politics, Competitive Intelligence, Her Greatest Triumph, and Succession and Legacy. The authors include within their narrative comments by women in our contemporary business world, comments which reveal and illuminate the relevance of Elizabeth I's leadership strategies and tactics to what all executives today (not only CEOs and dcertainly not only women) now need to be effective. If you have seen the recent films Shakespeare in Love and/or Elizabeth, you can already envision this remarkable woman. Higgins and Gilberd create for her a much broader and deeper context with which to understand her greatest strengths and most admirable virtues. If and when I am ever permitted to have a &quot;fantasy dinner&quot;, Elizabeth I would certainly be among those included, perhaps joined by Julius Caesar, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill, Katherine Graham, and Jack Welch.illuminate the relevance of Elizabeth I's leadership strategies and tactics to what all executives today (not only CEOs and dcertainly not only women) now need to be effective.

Thus, CM is inherently the process of seeing and dealing with larger, whole systems.\\" Moreover, \\"The basic or most central problem is that [because it goes sharply against the grain of of current management thought and practice] it requires cultural acceptance, and unfortunately, in the vast majority of cases, major cultural transformation.\\" The material is organized as follows:<br />Chapter One: Why Crises Are an Inevitable and Permanent Feature of Modern Societies<br />Chapter Two: The Failure of Success: The Tylenol Poisonings, Crisis Management's \\"Ancient History\\"<br />Chapter Three: A Best Practice Model: A General Framework for Crisis Management<br />Chapter Four: Should We Tell the Truth? The Varieties of Truth and Telling the Truth<br />Chapter Five: Assuming Responsibility: Victim or Villain?<br />Chapter Six: Detecting Weak Signals: Making Sure That You Are the First to Get the Worst News!<br />Chapter Seven: Thinking Far Outside of the Boxes<br />Chapter Eight: Treating the Big Picture<br />Chapter Nine: Crisis Management 2002: The Challenges Ahead<br />In The Art of War, Sun Tzu asserts that every battle is won or lost before it is fought. Hence the great importance Mitroff assigns to anticipation and preparation. I think his book would have even greater value if read in combination with Peter Schwartz's The Art of the Long View. Given the importance of this subject to any organization (regardless of its size or nature), I also recommend Steven Fink's Crisis Management.<br />When concluding his book, Mitroff offers these suggestions: \\"Start by designing and implementing signal detection [ie early warning] mechanisms throughout your organization. Start by amplifying the signals that already exist in your organization of impending crises. In many cases, the databases that indicate signals of impending crises may already exist, but they need to be reconceptualized to show their relationship to CM.\\" Sound advice. But ultimately, even the most comprehensive and sophisticated CM system cannot predict or suggest, much less prevent, every crisis. Once a crisis occurs, one of the most important questions Mitroff answers is \\"Now what?\\" That answer alone is well-worth the cost of this important book.he databases that indicate signals of impending crises may already exist, but they need to be reconceptualized to show their relationship to CM.\\" Sound advice.

Walker's purpose is to \\"describe and explain the American century through the lives and careers of a handful of individual Americans.\\"  He discusses 26, each whom he views as representative of a specific component within the evolution of American civilization. For example, Teddy Roosevelt (Ambition), Emma Goldman (Dissidence), Woodrow Wilson (Idealism), William Boeing (Air Transportation), Lucky Luciano (Crime), Katherine Hepburn (Stardom), and Alan Greenspan (Banking).<br />One of my favorites of the 22 essays is that which discusses Walt Disney (representative of American Entertainment). Walker first quotes Joseph Nye: \\"Soft power occurs when one country gets other countries to want what it wants, in contrast with the `hard' or coercive power of ordering others to do what it wants.\\" In response, he suggests that \\"the essence of America's new global hegemony was that the United States was not only the unique military superpower but also the dominant soft superpower, which [because of Disney's films] invented the world's dreams and defined its aspirations....The Disney Corporation has become the heartland of soft culture's colonial realm. It is unmatched in pillaging there cultures of others to repackage them in Disney's universal vocabulary....[Disney] aimed for what he once described as `that deathless, ageless, absolutely primitive remnant of something in every world-wracked human being which makes us play with children's toys and laugh without self-consciousness at silly things....You know, the Mickey in us'.\\" These brief excerpts correctly indicate Walker's highly subjective and yet circumspect perspective on 22 quite unique Americans. I have already mentioned eight. The others are \\"Black Jack\\" Pershing, Henry Ford, Babe Ruth, Duke Ellington, Winston Churchill, Frank Lloyd Wright, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Walter Reuther, John Steinbeck, Albert Einstein, George Marshall, William F. Buckley, Jr., Richard Bissell, Billy Graham, Richard Nixon, Martin Luther King, Jr., Betty Friedan, and Bill Clinton. If your desire is to understand America in the 20th century, I cannot think of another combination of lives and careers which will contribute more to that understanding than do those whom Walker discusses with eloquence and insight in this remarkable volume.orge Marshall, William F.

But it's not about searching for the silver bullet -- the best name or logo, the coolest service or product, or anything on the Internet. This book is about a mindset shift. Obviously, a long-term commitment is required for this mindset shift to take hold and for the approach I describe in this book to work.\\" He goes on to say, \\"This book provides a roadmap to start to achieve Brand Asset Management [BAM] excellence. It provides some new approaches and leverages successful approaches already established in many companies. And it demands that the brand be looked at holistically, encompassing every functional area within the organization.\\" Davis organizes his excellent material as follows:<br />Phase One: Developing a Brand Vision<br />Phase Two: Determining Your BrandPicture<br />Phase Three: Developing a Brand Asset Management Strategy<br />Phase Four: Supporting a Brand Asset Management Culture<br />Davis examines in detail eight of 11 \\"Steps\\", ranging from Elements of a Brand Vision to Establishing a Brand-Based Culture. Along the way, he includes countless examples to illustrate key points; also, practical suggestions based on a wealth of real-world experience. I agree with all of his key points which include<br />* Loyalty drives repeat business.<br />* Brand-based price premiums allow for higher margins.<br />* Strong brands lend immediate credibility to new product introductions.<br />* Strong brands allow for greater shareholder and stakeholder returns.<br />* Strong brands embody a clear, valued, and sustainable point of differentiation  relative to the competition.<br />* Strong brands mandate clarity in internal focus and brand execution.<br />* The more loyal the customer base and the stronger the brand, the more likely  customers will be forgiving if a company makes a mistake.<br />* Brand strength is a lever for attracting the best employees and keeping satisfied  customers.<br />* 70% of customers want to use a brand to guide their purchase decisions.<br />HOW? Davis fully and eloquently answers that question, recommending in the final chapter four \\"tools\\" to inspire and then engage employees during the implementation of a BAM strategy: (1) Have them \\"relive\\" the preparations which the formulation of that strategy required; (2) make sure they understand the end results to be achieved; (3) make sure they understand which specific actions must be taken; and finally (4), provide and thoroughly explain the game plan for the implementation of the BAM strategy. Davis correctly views employee involvement as \\"the most important element of Brand Asset Management\\", suggesting that with such involvement \\"there is no telling the limit of BAM success.\\" If any of this is relevant to your own organization's current and imminent needs, I urge you to read this book ASAP. Better yet, have all of the key people in your organization also read it, then meet (preferably off site) for 2-3 days to formulate your own \\"game plan.\\" But it is imperative to keep in mind that everyone throughout the organization must become not only involved but indeed engaged.

I presume to suggest that you first read the authors' more recently published book, The Irresistible Growth Enterprise in which they explain how to achieve \\"breakthrough gains from unstoppable change.\\" One of the key points in that book it is imperative to understand the nature and extent of such forces as they affect a given organization...then respond accordingly. Another key point stresses the importance of anticipating future changes which inevitably create problems. Each of these problems requires an effective solution. That is, a \\"2,000 Percent Solution\\" which enables an organization to get \\"20 times better and faster results from the same or fewer resources.\\"<br />The subtitle of this book correctly suggests why the authors wrote it: To \\"free\\" organizations from \\"stalled\\" thinking so that they can achieve \\"exponential success.\\" Note the words embraced by quotation marks. Most organizations (especially the larger ones) can easily become captive to basic assumptions and presumptions which are no longer valid...or at least appropriate. As a result, those involved feel obligated to defend the status quo. Their thinking is stalled. Managers become bureaucrats.  Because they are defending the status quo, they resist and resent any suggested changes of it. Of course, change does occur: The organization deteriorates. The \\"best and the brightest\\" employees leave as do under-served customers.<br />The reference to \\"exponential success\\" is also very significant. The authors correctly believe that, in the absence of Divine Intervention, sustainable success can only be achieved exponentially: building a skyscraper one floor at a time, paving a road to Oz one yellow brick at a time, eating a whale one bite at a time.<br />Part One explains how you can free your organization from \\"mind-forged manacles.\\" To do so, you must overcome:<br />The Stall Mind-Set  [\\"If I ignore it, it will eventually go away.\\"]<br />The Tradition Stall  [\\"But we've never done it that way before.\\"]<br />The Disbelief Stall  [\\"I can't believe you suggested that.\\"]<br />The Misconception Stall  [\\"Wet highways cause rain.\\"]<br />The Unattractiveness Stall  [\\"It may work but it just doesn't look right.\\"]<br />The Communications Stall  [\\"I'll get back to you with some feedback when I can.\\"]<br />The Bureaucratic Stall  [\\"This is highly irregular.\\"]<br />The Procrastination Stall  [\\"Interesting. I'm going to give it the careful thought it deserves.\\"]<br />The authors analyze each of these familiar stalls and evasions. Then in Part Two, they suggest (and explain in detail) \\"Eight Steps\\" by which to overcome them.  This book is \\"primarily about what to do differently rather than how to do something better than you do it today.\\" Pogo once observed, \\"We have met the enemy and he is us.\\" Stalling and evading strategies are basic to human nature. We tend to employ one or more of them whenever we feel threatened or confused or inadequate...or because, like Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener, we simply don't want to do what we are asked to do.<br />I highly recommend this book. The wealth of information and material is carefully organized and lucidly presented. The authors seem to have no illusions whatsoever as to the difficulty of implementing the \\"Eight Steps.\\" The success of those initiatives will indeed be exponential. My guess is that organizations which have the greatest need for this book will be most resistant to its recommendations. Those involved in such organizations would be well-advised to \\"think small.\\" That is, select a specific situation in which \\"unstalled thinking\\" can have an immediate, obvious, and quantifiable impact. Complete the \\"Eight Step Process.\\" And then leverage that success to achieve other successes...one \\"2,000 Percent Solution\\" at a time.<br />Obviously, both this book and The Irresistible Growth Enterprise can be read separately and still have great value. As noted previously, I suggest that the latter be read first. I also presume to suggest that both books will have even greater value if read in combination with Peter Schwartz's The Art of the Long View.suggest that both books will have even greater value if read in combination with Peter Schwartz's The Art of the Long View.	2000-11-13

In this new book, they develop in much greater depth many of the same ideas introduced in the previous book. For example, their concept of what they call \\"Irresistible Force Stalls\\" which are, in effect, various strategies by which to deny or attempt to delay unstoppable change. \\"Irresistible Forces\\" include the usual suspects: new technologies, improved communications, the weather, demographics, consumer preferences, and economic conditions. Here are some of the questions which, the authors correctly suggest, every organization must address:<br /><br />1.  Which irresistible forces are now having the greatest impact (positively or negatively) on our organization?<br />2.  What are the nature and extent of that impact? (eg increased market share or depletion of resources)<br />3.  What don't we now know that we need to know about these irresistible forces?<br />4.  Given our answers to #1 and #2, what are we now doing that is effective? Why? What isn't? Why not?<br />4.  Today, what remain our most serious unsolved problems? Why?<br />5.  Which irresistible forces will in all probability have the greatest impact on our organization in the future? (eg tomorrow) Why?<br />6.  What don't we now know that we need to know about these irresistible forces which are likely to develop?<br />7.  What must we do (NOW) to prepare for them?<br />8.. How can we more quickly and more accurately measure, anticipate, create, and manage irresistible forces that have (or will have) the greatest positive impact on our organization?<br /><br />The authors organize their material as follows: In Part One, \\"Irresistible Force Stalls -- Causes and Solutions\\", they examine various strategies which attempt to deny or at least delay unstoppable change; in Part Two, \\"Irresistible Force Management\\", they thoroughly explain HOW to avoid or overcome barriers (eg stalling strategies) to organizational growth and prosperity. They offer an \\"Eight-Step Process\\", devoting a separate chapter to each. For example, \\"Step Three: Identify the Future Best Practices for Locating, Anticipating, and Adapting to Changes in Irresistible Forces.\\"<br /><br />The Chinese character for the word \\"crisis\\" has two entirely different meanings: peril and opportunity. In the Epilogue, the authors urge their reader to \\"embrace change\\" as an exciting opportunity rather than fear or resent it as an unwelcome disruption.

Over the years, I have observed him carefully during various interviews during which he revealed a delicious (often self-deprecating) sense of humor in combination with absolute seriousness about what effective writing involves, indeed requires. To the best of my knowledge, in this book for the first time King assembles and examines in great detail most (if not all) of his thoughts and feelings about himself both as a person and as a writer. I share his high regard for Strunk and White's The Elements of Style. Perhaps he shares my high regard for Zinsser's On Writing. King's own On Writing would be a perfect holiday gift for anyone, for a younger person especially, who has already demonstrated some talent as a writer and is serious about improving the skills of craftsmanship. This is also a book anyone will read with pleasure, perhaps with joy. That was my own experience.<br />One final point: King leaves no doubt about the enormous difficulties of writing well. I am reminded of Rod Steiger's response whenever aspiring young actors request his advice. He asks them if they want to be an actor or if they have to be an actor. \\"The longer it takes for them to answer that question, the less likely it is that they will succeed.\\" Hemingway once explained that he wrote because he had to \\"get it out.\\" Those who have to write will write. King's book can help them to write better. For everyone else, King's book can help them to read with greater awareness as well as appreciation of those who write well. And all will get to know this best-selling author in the process.	2000-11-13

We examine trust as a process, which has beginnings and endings, which can be derailed and encouraged, and which take place across time and experience. We analyze the key components of trust and the process which trust involves in a relationship.\\" To give you at least some idea of what this book addresses, here are the questions answered in Part One (\\"Perspectives on Trust\\"):<br />What would be the benefits if your clients trusted you more?<br />What do great trusted advisors all seem to do?<br />What are the dynamics of trusting and being trusted?<br />How do you ensure that your advice is listened to?<br />What are the principles of building strong relationships?<br />What attitudes must you have to be effective?<br />Do you really have to care for those you advise?<br />In the final chapter, the authors include \\"The Quick-Impact List to Gain Trust\\" and then an Appendix in which they duplicate all of the checklists previously provided. I rate this book so highly for twqo reasons: First, because the content is rock-solid, anchored in a wealth of real-world experiences which the authors generously share; also because they explain HOW to gain and then sustain the trust of everyone with whom you do business. This book will be especially valuable to small-to-midsize companies whose success or failure is primarily (if not entirely) dependent upon client relationships based on trust.  Buyers have lots of choices. It is not enough for them to trust what you sell. Others may well offer the same product or service. They must also trust you, the seller. And here's the key point: It is imperative that customer trust your advice as they consider a purchase from you but, ultimately, your customers must have so much confidence in you that they will also seek your advice on other matters which have nothing to do with what you sell. So-called \\"customer satisfactioon\\" is achieved on a per-transaction basis. As Jeffrey Gitomer correctly asserts, your objective should be \\"customer loyalty.\\"  The authors of this book explain HOW to achieve it and then HOW to sustain it.must also trust you, the seller.

(She apparently agrees with Derek Bok, former president of Harvard, when responding to irate parents after a tuition increase: \\"If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.\\") In her Introduction, she identifies three myths (or assumptions) about the idea of knowledge sharing: (1) build it and they will come (the so-called \\"Field of Dreams Syndrome\\"), (2) technology can replace face-to-face, and (3) first you have to create a learning culture. \\"Many of the organizations I studied started with one or more of these assumptions and then had to make corrections to get back on track.\\" She then explains why each myth or assumption is either wrong or inadequate. After that, she observes: My major goal in writing this book is to broaden readers' thinking about how a company might share knowledge. Therefore I discuss many ways in which real companies have successfully transferred knowledge....Another goal is to help readers figure out which of these many systems [subsequently analyzed] would be most effective in their own settings -- how to tell whether BP's Peer Assist would be more effective than Ford's Best Practice Replication.\\" All this in the Introduction (!) which serves as the first of the nine chapters within which her material is organized.<br />The objective of Dixon's study of ten organizations (ranging from Bechtel to the U.S. Army) was to understand why some knowledge transfer systems are effective...and why others are not. Eventually, she concluded that \\"These organizations know a great deal about how...but much less about why.\\" Moreover, \\"Organizations like the ones I have written about in this book, that are on the leading edge of knowledge transfer have been learning on their own, primarily through trial and error.\\" To which I presume to add, that we must understand how to learn if any knowledge (about anything else) is to be gained. Moreover, there are also quite specific skills required when helping others to learn what we know. In her book, Dixon provides a wealth of information which includes cases and examples, a \\"synthesis that retains the separate voices of the examples\\", \\"stories\\" which preserve the emotions and values of people involved. general principles derived from the cases, and an \\"articulation\\" of the reasoning behind the various categories (eg absorptive capacity) inorder to reveal the WHY behind the categories. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Peter Senge's The Fifth Discipline and his more recent The Dance of Change.	2000-11-13

In an article which appeared in FSB magazine, Ashbrook explains \\"There is a game I call startup solitaire. It doesn't have a rule book. It just comes to you, late at night. It goes like this: You're alone in your bedroom with a tall stack of credit cards. You're slowly spreading them out on the bed, turning the cards over and over, checking them against your monthly statements, looking for a few more dollars to borrow.\\"<br />As he observes in the book, Ashbrook had dreams his life wasn't touching. He heard a clock ticking. He knew the world was changing in ways that obliterated his old assumptions. \\"Something huge was happening, something on a scale so large that I was lucky to see it even once in my lifetime. It was stirring economies and imaginations and possibilities like nothing I had ever known. And the more I looked at it, the more desperately I wanted to be a part of it.\\"<br />For those who are tempted to make a leap into High Risk/High Reward Entrepreneurship, this is \\"must reading\\" because the game to be played -- startup solitaire -- is not for the timid nor for the incompetent. Ashbrook enables his reader to accompany him each step up to his \\"leap\\", while he is airborne, and then....The book's subtitle correctly suggests that this is \\"a memoir of love and madness in the internet gold rush.\\" Like so many others, Ashbrook was caught up in what was the apparently irresistible \\"fever\\" of it. What happened to him, to his family members, his friends, and his business associates? What did he learn from his experiences? It's all here, waiting for you to share it...albeit vicariously and perhaps from a position of relative security.	2000-11-04

Welch, Jr.). A wide range of individuals discuss an even wider range of business issues. My suggestion is to select a topic or two of greatest interest and dive in. Because business circumstances can so often change so rapidly and (sometimes) unexpectedly, what you learn from what you read today may well help you to prepare more effectively for an uncertain future in which a new peril or opportunity emerges.

It provides leaders at all levels of the organization -- all those who initiate, design,, and implement change -- with a set of principles for bringing about change in a turbulent world. It is not a methodology, nor is it a set of techniques; rather, it is a set of principles that everyone can fall back on when faced with new and different situations.\\" In Part One, Axelrod identifies the problems with the current change management paradigm. In effect, he demythologizes conventional thinking on this subject. In Part Two, he examines four principles for producing an engaged organization, devoting a separate chapter to each. It is important to keep in mind that the nature and extent of production (or results) will be determined almost entirely by the nature and extent of engagement throughout an organization.<br /><br />In Part Three, Axelrod shares his insights and suggestions which will assist his reader during the \\"Getting Started\\" phase of the process. Also, Axelrod discusses what he calls the \\"minefields\\" on the \\"road to [organization-wide] engagement.\\" He concludes with a brief, especially valuable analysis of \\"eight specific issues the engagement paradigm can help you tackle, including the introduction of new technology, the increase in mergers, acquisitions, and alliances, and growing dissociation from communities.\\"<br /><br />If you are now involved in any of this or are about to become involved, I recommend this book highly. Carefully select those strategies which are most appropriate to your own organization's needs and interests. Axelrod can then help you to chart or to reformulate a proper course to implement those strategies.	2000-11-04

Its subsequent growth helps to explain many of the management systems that Capodagli and Jackson describe but it is also worth noting four themes continue to serve as \\"pillars\\": Dream, Believe, Dare, Do.<br /><br />The material is organized within 11 chapters, followed by an Epilogue in which the authors observe that the integration and interplay between and among the ten principles they have examined can be of substantial benefit to other companies. The \\"Dream, Believe, Dare, and Do Process\\" does indeed have all manner of potential applications for companies in industries wholly unrelated to entertainment. There must be dreams to believe in and courage to pursue those dreams. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Warren Bennis and Patricia Ward Biederman's Organizing Genius, one of whose chapters focuses on the Disney animation team that produced classic films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Bambi, and Pinocchio.<br /><br />I realize that the Disney organization has become a vast global network of several \\"magic kingdoms\\" but the ten core principles continue to serve as its foundation:<br /><br />1. Give every member of your organization a chance to dream, and to tap into the creativity those dreams evoke and nourish. '<br />2. Stand firm on your beliefs and principles. '<br />3. Treat your customers like guests. '<br />4. Support, empower, and reward employees. '<br />5. Build long-term relationships with key suppliers and partners. '<br />6- Dare to take calculated risks in order to bring innovative ideas to fruition. '<br />7. Train extensively and constantly to nurture and strengthen the company's culture. '<br />8. Align long-term vision with short-term execution of what achieves that vision. '<br />9. Take full advantage of storyboarding techniques during brainstorming sessions to generate ideas that answer questions and solve problems. '<br />10.

He is surprised to learn that part of his orientation involves understanding what is identified to him as &quot;the box.&quot; As revealed in the narrative which develops (Tom is the narrator), self-betrayal occurs when we fail to do what we know we should do.  Rather than accept responsibility, we blame someone else. As this pattern of self-deception continues, we begin to see the world in a way that justifies us. As a result, whether we realize it or not (probably not), we find ourselves in &quot;the box.&quot;<br />It is important to understand that the box is not a fixed enclosure. People haul it around wherever they go, from one situation to the next, indeed from one job to the next, and from one marriage to the next. At the end of the business day, they take it home with them. I like the box metaphor because it correctly suggests enclosure and captivity. But in a sense, the box also resembles apparel. A raincoat, for example.<br />Those who are in the box should have two separate but related objectives: Get out of the box and then stay out of the box. How? Good question. Through their skillful presentation of various conversations between and among Tom and his associates at Zagrum Company, the authors answer that question by offering several specific suggestions. It would be inappropriate for me to reveal them now.<br />But think about it. How many times have you been in this situation? You know what you should do for another person but you don`t do it. This is self-betrayal. (Sound familiar?) Then you devise all manner of self-justifications. Perhaps you have said something to the effect that &quot;It's not my job&quot; or &quot;It's not my responsibility&quot; or &quot;It wouldn't make any difference to her anyway&quot; or &quot;He got what he deserves.&quot; This is self-deception.<br />By the end of the book, Tom has completed Phase 1 of what the authors identify as a three-phase Results System and we have accompanied him each step of the way. The book ends with much of his personal growth yet to be completed.<br />At this point, I offer a word of caution: Please do not conclude that this brief commentary reveals everything you need to know about this remarkable book.

It can be valuable to your understanding of why so many people create their own problems, are unable and/or unwilling to see that they are creating their own problems, and then resist any attempts by others to help them stop creating those problems.<br />This book will be even more valuable if you are among them...the &quot;so many people.&quot;ou devise all manner of self-justifications.

I have been a lifelong baseball fan and consider DiMaggio to be among the greatest of those who played the game. He combined natural ability in the five key skill areas (ie hitting, fielding, throwing, base running, and bunting) with a style and grace few others have. Also he was a winner, playing on nine world championship Yankee teams during a 13-year period. No one doubts the on-field achievements of \\"Jolting Joe.\\" The controversy generated by this book is explained, rather, by Cramer's comments about DiMaggio off the field and especially after he retired.<br />According to Cramer, DiMaggio was unapproachable to anyone who could not (one way or another) feed his ego, increase his wealth, enhance his lifestyle, or protect his carefully crafted self-image. Throughout most of his life, DiMaggio seemed to ask \\"What's in it for me?\\" He not only craved but indeed required treatment normally reserved for heads of state. According to Cramer, he had very few close personal relationships (none with family members) and these were sustained only when in full compliance with the terms and conditions he established. DiMaggio trusted very few people, suspecting that anyone who tried to approach him had ulterior, self-serving motives. There is an old saying about \\"knowing the cost of everything and the value of nothing.\\" DiMaggio knew both.<br />One critic has suggested that Cramer is \\"hostile\\" to DiMaggio. Another critic has described this book as a \\"hatchet job.\\" Cramer indicates no doubt about DiMaggio's greatness as a baseball player. That was one game he played superbly. Cramer also seems to have no doubt about another game DiMaggio played in his private life and in his post-baseball career. This second game also had very strict rules set by DiMaggio, rules with which he insisted that everyone else comply. Re Cramer's attitude toward this DiMaggio, I am reminded of Harry Truman who once observed \\"I just tell them the truth and they think it's hell.\\" After reading this book, you may conclude that Cramer is \\"hostile\\", that he has done a \\"hatchet job\\" on the Yankee Clipper. Or perhaps you will agree with me that Cramer has accumulated as much information as he could and then portrayed DiMaggio as fully and as honestly as he could.<br />My guess (only a guess) is that Cramer's DiMaggio would not have objected to this biography if he received at least half (but preferably all) of the royalties from copies sold. No matter what Cramer or anyone else may say about DiMaggio's human imperfections (eg greed and vanity), he played the game of baseball with skills, style, and grace which -- like his 56-game hitting streak -- may never be surpassed.ward this DiMaggio, I am reminded of Harry Truman who once observed \\"I just tell them the truth and they think it's hell.\\" After reading this book, you may conclude that Cramer is \\"hostile\\", that he has done a \\"hatchet job\\" on the Yankee Clipper.

The first is probably the best biography of Bellow we canexpect unless and until he agrees to work closely with someoneelse. In that event, I suspect, the results would not be of the samehigh quality because Bellow (consciously or unconsciously) wouldmanipulate the material and the presentation of it with an intellectand a willpower few other persons possess. The second is acomprehensive analysis of his canon and I think it isfirst-rate. Others far better qualified than I may challenge some ofthe various analyses but they certainly are sufficient to my needs. Irank Bellow among the greatest American novelists of anycentury. Frankly, I was astonished when reading Ravelstein to findthat in this immensely complicated work, Bellow seems to be inhis prime. How can that possibly be true at his age and after all thathe has personally experienced for so many decades? Long ago, Whitmansaid \\"I am large. I contain multitudes.\\" The same can be said ofBellow. Whatever anyone may think of his personal life as it hasevolved through the years, through marriages and divorces, throughfriendships gained and lost, no one (at least anyone with anyintelligence and taste) can deny his stature as a literary artist ofthe very highest rank. I am deeply grateful to James Atlas for hissubstantial contributions to my understanding and appreciation ofBellow.	2000-10-19

Connect with us, and lob a grenade or two. Our conversation with each other is always respectful but not always polite.\\" As they then explain, their book has five parts. \\"In the first, we outline our three themes [ie the growing efficiency of financial and real markets, the primacy of human capital, and the obsolescence of social capital] and the economic forces that are driving them. Then, in Parts II through IV, we look at how the themes play out for individuals, businesses, and society. We close with twenty \\"Perfect Futures\\" on the horizon (Part V).\\" As the authors already understand, the speed of change resembles a Blur but the same word can be used to describe the confusion which often results from high-speed change.<br />The authors seem to have several separate but related objectives, most of which are indicated in the brief excerpt just quoted. First, to explain certain themes as well as the economic forces which drive them. These themes are subject to change or at least to revision; also, the forces which now drive them may be replaced by others. Some of the authors' best thinking is found in Parts II through IV. Once again, in a Blur, the specifics in their analyses of individuals, businesses, and society may change but, in my opinion, the rationale for analysis which they follow will remain sound. With regard to Part V, Horizons\\", it is likely (if not certain) that several of the \\"Twenty Perfect Futures\\" will never materialize. But, again my opinion, that is not the salient point. Rather, the authors correctly insist that we must constantly formulate \\"perfect futures\\" in whatever number we prefer. Peter Schwartz and others have stressed the importance of mastering what Schwartz calls \\"the art of the long view.\\" Presumably Davis and Meyer agree.<br />If after reading this book you think other themes driven by other forces are more important, fine. Presumably you will be as well-prepared to support your selections as Davis and Meyer are to support theirs. Also, if after reading this book, you have entirely different opinions about the nature and extent of interrelationships between and among individuals, businesses, and society, fine. (My personal preference is to focus on \\"organizations\\" which include but are not limited to companies. Also, I have some different perspectives on \\"society\\", believing that much closer attention should be given to elements such as symbol and ritual.) As for \\"perfect futures\\", Davis and Meyer select 20. Given your own circumstances, it may make much more sense to formulate and then extrapolate (with \\"the art of the long view\\") more or fewer.<br />I rate this book so highly because it poses so many important questions, and, because the answers provided are both thoughtful and thought-provoking. Do I totally agree with Davis and Meyer? Certainly not, as already indicated, but I am grateful to them for stimulating me to think about the issues they raise.  For less than the cost of dinner in a world-class restaurant, you can feed your brain (and your organization) with ideas provided by world-class thinkers. Judge for yourself which ideas have value to you as all of us proceed into the Blur which awaits.f after reading this book you think other themes driven by other forces are more important, fine.

So often, we hear someone say that &quot;Our most valuable assets walk out the door at the end of each day.&quot; That's true. But what does it really mean when assigning  value to human &quot;assets&quot;? Davenport has written a very solid book (I'm NOT damning with faint praise), one which I strongly recommend. Given the importance of this subject, I again suggest reading at least the four books previously identified. Who knows? Davenport may be, in your considered opinion, the most hepful. He has a sharp mind. He writes very well indeed. His observations and suggestions are rock-solid. (Chapter Nine all by itself is well worth the cost of the book.) My initial rating of his book was Four Stars but as I began to formulate my thoughts which comprise this brief commentary, I've changed my mind. When transmitting to the Amazonians, I shall increase that rating to Five Stars. How valuable this book is to you is a determination only you can make. One final point: For the cost of only one hour of my time as an independent management consultant, you can purchase at least four books on this critically important subject. If that isn't great value, I really don't know what is.	2000-10-19

That is to say, directly or indirectly, every company (regardless of size or nature) is involved in globalization. This book may not be \\"the complete resource for expanding small and midsize businesses\\" but I know of no other single volume which offers more and better guidance. The authors organize their material within nine chapters which range from \\"The Global Business\\" to \\"Measuring Your Success.\\" They then provide an excellent Appendix which discusses \\"Five Stages of Organizational Development for Small Firms\\" followed by a second Appendix which explains how to create a \\"Global Marketing Plan.\\"<br />If your organization is unsure as to how to proceed, here is my suggestion. Select key people and purchase for each a copy of this book. Next, select a date and an off-site location to conduct a rigorous workshop during which this book serves as the agenda. Insist that all participants read the book in advance. Finally, make it crystal clear that you expect the group to formulate a \\"Game Plan\\" to implement.

How many times have you been asked \\"Seen a good movie lately?\\" or \\"What's your favorite Italian restaurant?\\" or \\"Where can I get the best deal on an air conditioner?\\" The single most powerful but least understood form of marketing is word-of-mouth and yet, until now, no one has devoted to it the attention it deserves. In the Foreword to this book, Everett M. Rogers observes, \\"New products and services spread among the consumer public through interpersonal communication networks. These networks are for the most part invisible. They often operate in mysterious ways.. Thus we are largely blind to this very powerful marketing process. No wonder that we fail so often in our efforts to diffuse innovations.\\" He's right.<br />Rosen explains how to create effective word-of-mouth marketing with material organized within three Parts: How Buzz Spreads, Success in the Networks, and Stimulating Buzz. It is important to stress that Buzz results only in combination with a superior product or service. As Jeffrey Gitomer correctly points out, \\"customer satisfaction\\" is achieved only on a per-transaction basis; the objective is to achieve and then sustain \\"customer loyalty.\\" It is not only possible but common for a new product or service to generate Buzz initially but if the quality is not sustainable (preferably enhanced), what I call Positive Buzz can become Negative Buzz. (Even under Rosen's personal supervision, no matter how much perfume you pour on a pig, it's still a pig. The only buzz it generates will be provided by insects.) The \\"interpersonal communication networks\\" to which Rogers refers can just as effectively (and probably more quickly) \\"get the word out\\" about a defective product or unsatisfactory service. Obviously, no Buzz is preferable to Negative Buzz.<br />Rosen is talking about Positive Buzz. He explains HOW to take full advantage of the marketing opportunities it permits. In Chapter 16, \\"Buzz Workshop\\", he asks and then answers a series of very basic but profoundly important questions. (All by itself, this final chapter is well-worth the cost of the book. I strongly recommend that this chapter be re-read on a regular basis. Competitive marketplaces do have a way of changing, don't they?) Once having read the book, the reader is well-prepared to select and then implement those concepts, strategies, and tactics which are most appropriate to her or his own situation.<br />This book will be especially valuable to small-to-midsize companies with limited resources but the success of any marketing efforts (Buzz or otherwise) will still depend upon the quality of the product or service offered. All of us now actively involved in marketing owe a substantial debt to Rosen. Revealingly, the quality of his thinking and the originality of his ideas created Buzz long before his book was published. The acclaim he continues to receive is richly deserved.sic but profoundly important questions. (All by itself, this final chapter is well-worth the cost of the book.

Chandler explains that \\"These are the lies to the soul...[which] we send down inside ourselves that convince us that we don't have any power.\\" His book is dedicated \\"to uncovering a racket -- the racket of conning ourselves into believing deep down inside we are helpless. The racket that talks us into believing in our defects instead of our energy.\\" Chandler believes (and I agree) that honesty really is the best policy, especially with ourselves. The opposite is also true. Most of our wounds are self-inflicted. One way or another, the 17 lies he examines are forms of self-deception which can so easily enable us (key word \\"enable') to justify to ourselves almost anything. Ernest Hemingway once suggested that all great writers have \\"a built-in, shock-proof crap detector.\\" (His own was often in need of repair.) Without such a device, we are vulnerable to lies told by others. Worse yet, we believe the lies we tell ourselves.<br />Chandler explains, \\"The widespread popularity of self-deceiving might be due to its effectiveness. It gets the job done. It takes us out of the game. It sits us down at the end of the bench so we don't have to play. It even puts a cool towel around our necks, a towel in which we can hide our faces if we become ashamed that the world is passing us by.\\" Even those who compete can always find a reason to justify lack of effort, selfishness, insubordination, etc.<br />The material in this book is organized within two parts: \\"Lying to the Soul\\" which introduces the 17 lies, a chapter devoted to each; then \\"Finding Your Deepest Power\\" in which Chandler discusses the true source of power, the idea of owning one's life, the concept of self-control, and the process of locating one's \\"soul purpose.\\"<br />Frankly, I have by now become weary of (if not hostile to) books and articles on many of these same subjects. (You know what I mean: \\"Give yourself a big hug and then go buy yourself South America! You deserve it because you're wonderful!\\") For that reason I was somewhat skeptical as I began to read Chandler's book. Almost immediately I realized that Chandler really does have some very important insights to share, most of them obtained after years of lying to himself. As I approached the final chapter, I was eager to be told how to stop the deception...\\"all this lying.\\" I was ready for THE ANSWER.<br />Well, Chandler refuses to provide one. Only after I re-read the book did I fully understand what he means (in the final chapter) when he suggests, \\"The best way to stop the lying is to stop it your own way. Once you know [italics] the truth that you are powerful beyond measure, you will intuitively and immediately find your own way. The truth itself sets you free....Once you've found your own way to be straight with yourself, you will use it forever. It won't go away, because it's yours. You own it. When the time comes, don't forget to be happy. You are an owner of the human spirit.\\"<br />How easy it is to read comments such as these; how difficult it was for Chandler to gain the personal experience he needed to recognize the truth in them. In the strongest terms I can now summon, I urge you to read and then re-read this book. It will not transform your life from lies to truth, from self-deception to self-revelation. Only you can do that but Chandler will help you to complete that difficult process.For that reason I was somewhat skeptical as I began to read Chandler's book.

In his Introduction, Salz observes:<br />\\"This book is about facing everyday life, work, and relationships with the spirit of adventure. And one thing is certain: most folks in modern civilization are seriously in need of adventure. Never before has a species been locked in a struggle with its own datebooks for survival. We are moving so fast that the phrase human race has taken on a new meaning; each day we feel as though we are falling farther and farther behind. And there is a modem to our madness.\\"<br />Years ago, someone whose name I do not recall suggested to the effect that there is so much pleasure in our lives...but so little joy. Salz seems to agree. The subtitle of his book indicates that it is about \\"transforming your life and work with spirit and vision\\" and that is quite true. He engages his reader in a spiritual as well as physical journey which consists of a series of six \\"steps\\", each of which he discusses with meticulous care and engaging sensitivity. These \\"steps\\" are:<br />Leap Before You Look<br />Aim Higher Than Everest<br />Give It All You've Got<br />Work Some Magic<br />Keep On Your Bearing<br />Enjoy the View<br />It would be a great disservice to Salz and to you for me to reveal more about the aforementioned \\"journey\\" except to add it is one which really can enable anyone to transform her or his life and work \\"with spirit and vision.\\" If you are among those who now feel (and are concerned about) an absence of joy in their lives, read this book and then seek out your own \\"mountains\\" to climb. Whitman once said, \\"I am large. I contain multitudes.\\" So are you. I am certain you will find Salz to be an invaluable source of wisdom and inspiration as you prepare for your next \\"journey.\\"	2000-10-14

We yearn for the heroic, yet are also inherently suspicious of it.We demand dynamic leadership, yet grant only limited powers to the president. We want presidents to be dispassionate analysts and listeners, yet they must also be decisive. We are impressed with presidents who have great self-confidence, yet we dislike arrogance and respect those who express reasonable self-doubt.\\"<br />Throughout the balance of this chapter, they then identify and briefly discuss nine specific paradoxes which serve as the intellectual infrastructure of this brilliant book. In process, the authors also provide (in effect) a comprehensive analysis of more than 200 years of American history during which the office of the president as well as those who have occupied it reflect the dynamic tensions between and among the elements of the nine paradoxes.<br />The authors seem to suggest that those American presidents who have proven most effective have been those who (a) understood various paradoxes and then (b) somehow resolved them. The Roosevelts offer two of the best examples. Both were born into wealth and privilege and yet each is best remembered for advancing \\"populist\\" causes. The authors invite the reader to view the American presidency \\"by viewing it through the lens of a series of [such] paradoxes that shape and define the office. Our goal is to convey the complexity, the many-sidedness, and the contrarian aspects of the office.\\"<br />This book will be of special value to those interested in American history, of course, but also to those who are CEOs of organizations, especially of publicly owned corporations whose CEOs must accommodate the needs and interests of so many different (often antagonistic) constituencies.	2000-10-14

As Baker explains in the Executive Summary, \\"This book  guides you through the process of evaluating, building, and using social  capital.\\" With precision and eloquence, Baker focuses on HOW to take full  advantage of what he calls \\"hidden resources\\" in both personal and business  networks. For example, in ideas, leads, business opportunities, financial  capital, power and influence, emotional support, even goodwill, trust, and  cooperation. Social capital consists of who you know, who knows you, and  shared opportunities for you and them to derive mutual benefit. \\"The goal  of building social capital as an organizational competence is the same as  building it as an individual competence -- to increase the ability to  achieve goals, fulfill missions, and make positive contributions to the  world.\\" Throughout the book's five chapters, Baker answers questions such  as these:<br />* What is social capital?<br />* Why can it be so important to  you?<br />* How to measure and evaluate your social capital?<br />* What are the  most effective strategies for building entrepreneurial networks? (Baker  suggests 30.)<br />* How to derive greatest benefit from your own social  capital?<br />* How to build social capital as a competence within your  organization?<br />If you seek answers to questions such as these, this book  is \\"must reading.\\"	2000-09-12

A clear understanding of the multiple value creation perspectives  and activities that exist at the individual and organizational levels<br />3.  A clear understanding of the organization's strategy as well as a clearly  defined personal strategy for success<br />4. A personal measure of success  that exceeds organizational expectations<br />5. A mastery of speed without  sacrificing quality<br />Thakor correctly stresses the importance of  understanding what \\"value\\" means, both to you and to your organization. (Is  your definition of &quot;value&quot; in proper alignment with your  organization's definition of it?) Also, he stresses the importance of  continually refining your personal strategy as well as continually  improving your motivation to derive internal satisfaction from your  efforts. Also, he offers a caution and then a recommendation: \\"No matter  how well you are creating value, there is always somebody out there doing  something better than you are. Find out what that something is. Learn that  what makes these people better at it [hence more valuable] than you.  Discover their `rules' and adapt them to your setting to improve your  effectiveness.\\"<br />Most organizations claim that their most valuable assets  \\"walk out the door at the end of each day.\\" Of course, the reference is to  people -- human capital. Perhaps no employee is indispensable but some  employees are most valuable than others. However harsh it may seem,  employees who create no value have no value. Read Thakor's book. It can  help you to create greater value for your organization and thereby increase  and enhance your own value to that organization...while perhaps, in  process, increasing and enhancing your appeal to other organizations.

She organizes the material within 14  chapters, focusing on such diverse subjects as Manhattan's origins, its  \\"multireligious destiny\\", its emergence as a world-class seaport, its  \\"merchant princes\\", its multi-ethnic demographics,  the ascent of its rich  and the struggles of its poor, the metamorphosis of Broadway, the  settlement and development of the other four boroughs, its \\"politicians for  all seasons\\" (ie insightful profiles of Peter Stuyvesant, Thomas Dongan,  Fernando Wood, and Fiorello LaGuardia), its triumphs of architecture and  urban engineering, its emerging role as a world-class center of the  creative and performing arts, the national and international impact of its  communications community, and its passion for competitive sports.<br />All of  us have images of New York (most of them of Manhattan and many of them the  result of films and television programs anchored there) and many of us know  at least something about the city's colorful history.

Utterback explains \\"how companies can seize opportunities in the face of  technological change.\\" There are dozens (hundreds?) of other books on the  same subject, notably those written by Geoffrey A. Moore. I rate this book  so highly because it is exceptionally well-organized and well-written,  because it examines several offbeat subjects (eg the development of the  typewriter and the evolution of the typewriter industry, the development of  the incandescent electric light), and because Utterback focuses so  intensely -- and so effectively -- on real-world situations in which the  \\"dynamics of innovation\\" are manifest. This book is very informative but  also great fun to read. (Those who enjoy it as much as I did are urged to  read both The History of Invention and The Lever of Riches.) Chapter 4  revisits the the dynamics of the innovation model (Figure 1-1) and then in  Chapter 5, Utterback shifts his attention to developments within the plate  glass manufacturing industry. In Chapter 6, he examines the innovation  differences between assembled and nonassembled products. Subsequent  chapters sustain the discussion of \\"the power of innovation in the creation  of an industry\\" and then, in Chapter 9, Utterback \\"draws together some of  the lessons of earlier chapters and academic research to consider the  relationship between the behaviors and strategies of firms with respect to  technological innovation and long-term survival.\\" He concludes his book (in  Chapter 10) by addressing \\"the perennial management issue of how  corporations can renew their technology, products, and processes as a basis  for continued competitive vitality.\\" It is obvious to all of us that even  the strongest product and business strategy will eventually be overturned  by technological change. Ours is an age in which change is the only  constant. Therefore, as Utterbach explains so carefully and so eloquently,  the challenge is to accept the inevitability of change which results from  technological innovation (\\"discontinuities\\") and to sustain a commitment to  cope effectively with such change. Only such a commitment \\"will win the  day.\\"gical innovation (\\"discontinuities\\") and to sustain a commitment to  cope effectively with such change.

In process, he rigorously examines a  number of best practices common to all:<br />Focus on Building Brand  Awareness<br />Cultivate Customer Commitment<br />Forge Strong Distribution and  Content Alliances<br />Move Early, Move Fast<br />Develop an Intimate Knowledge  of the Market and the Customer<br />Cultivate a Reputation for  Excellence<br />Deliver Outstanding Value<br />Carpenter devotes a separate  chapter to each of the six companies. In the Conclusion, he suggests that  \\"the development of an Internet brand is a holistic process. Building  awareness -- the activity that many equate with `branding' -- is just one  aspect of brand development. Crafting a powerful online brand requires  paying just as much attention to developing other facets of brand as well,  such as customer loyalty and influential distribution partnerships. There  is no silver bullet solution for the development of a substantial Internet  brand. Instead, dominant ebrands emerge when companies invest in a rich  mixture of marketing and business practices.\\" If there is a better book on  this subject, I have not as yet read it.	2000-08-29

How good  was Smith? In the Foreword, Ira Berkow notes that a \\"blue-ribbon panel\\" was  commissioned to select the 25 most influential newspaper people of the  Twentieth Century. The final list included numerous publishers (eg  Pulitzer, Ochs, and Graham) and writers (eg Mencken, Lippmann, and Pyle)  but only one sportswriter: Red Smith. I thoroughly reading every single  column and especially appreciated Smith's comments on Hall of Famers, of  course, but also on dozens of others who had but one brief moment of glory.  For example, Floyd (\\"Bill\\") Bevens,  Al Gionfriddo, and Cookie Lavagetto.  For those who share my passion for what was once the \\"national pastime\\",  Smith was more than a great baseball writer or (as the blue-ribbon panel  concluded) a great writer, period. He was also an anthropologist who  examined a unique culture with style and grace as well as precision. Also  with delicious wit. I would love to share Smith's thoughts about Major  League Baseball today. Alas, that is a book he cannot write...and a book no  one else could write better than he. Period.	2000-08-29

Those who have read Crossing the Chasm and/or Inside the Tornado already know that Moore is among the brightest, most eloquent of contemporary  business thinkers. In the Introduction to this book, he explains that it is  \\"about managing for shareholder value, a discipline that has been widely  endorsed but rather poorly described. Specifically, it is intended to  answer one question that is haunting numerous management teams at the turn  of the century: [italics] What should a company that rose to prominence  prior to the Internet know and do about its stock price now that the  Internet is upon us?\\" There are related questions:<br />1. What are the  fundamental changes that collectively represent the transitions to the new  economy?<br />2. If a stock price directly equates to sustainable competitive  advantage, what must a management team do to convert that stock price into  an appropriate management information system?<br />3. What are the most  effective strategies for recognizing, catching, and then riding the next  technology \\"wave\\"?<br />4. What are the most effective strategies for coping  with the \\"destabilizing effects\\" on markets caused by shifts in underlying  technologies?<br />5. As markets evolve through a series of four distinct  stages which comprise the \\"the technology adoption life cycle\\", how and  where (and especially WHY) can a new technology cause so many corporations  to fail?<br />6. Which cultural models should be considered if the objective  is to sustain \\"long-term vibrant success\\"?<br />With uncommon skill, Moore  addresses these and other key questions. Although it may seem that this  book was written only for decision-makers in large, publicly traded  companies, I now suggest that almost all of the information and suggestions  provided are also relevant to privately held companies as well as to  non-profits. Moore's ultimate objective is to explain HOW to maximize value  of any organization in the Age of the Internet. He suggests that an  organization conduct a series of workshops for its senior managers, each  workshop based on one of the chapters in this book. That is an excellent  suggestion. The material could also be the substance of an off-site  &quot;retreat&quot;, with its Table of Contents serving as the agenda.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are strongly encouraged to  read Ehrbar's EVA, Christensen's The Innovator's Dilemma, and Collins &amp;  Porras' Built to Last.n  organization conduct a series of workshops for its senior managers, each  workshop based on one of the chapters in this book.

Get on the Balcony [ie \\"see far and wide...view every  aspect of the business and the marketplace in which it operates\\"]<br />2.  Communicate What Is Real [ie \\"explain what's going on....simply, fully, and  clearly\\"]<br />3. Clarify Competing Values [ie \\"identify opposing individuals  and help each one to understand the thought processes underlying the  proposal for change\\" to create shared values which are \\"the heart and  backbone\\" of the organization]<br />4. Support Changes in Values [ie  constantly reinforce a new set of values which are being instilled  throughout the organization]<br />5. Promote Dialogue [ie involve everyone in  on-going discussion, especially those who disagree, to advance learning and  increase understanding]<br />6. Regulate Distress [ie \\"diligently watch the  level of distress among workers and maneuver a balance between too much and  not enough\\"]<br />7. Make Everyone Collectively Responsible [ie assign what  must be done to those who can do it best, require others to assist those  efforts,...and then hold everyone accountable for results]<br />With regard to  this last \\"essential act\\", Laurie shares several \\"lessons\\" he has learned:  Resist the temptation to supply answers; create self-confidence;  distinguish between internal operational problems and external strategic  problems, both of which may involve technical and adaptive work; remember  that people must commit to one another before they will commit to a  strategy; look upon diverse points of view as valuable, not problematic;  and finally, allow people to take risks and support them when they make  mistakes.<br />Laurie agrees with Ronald A. Heifetz that \\"the true heroism of  leadership involves having the courage to face reality and the capacity to  help others do the same.\\" Throughout this book, Laurie examines the  leadership style and values of several top executives in major corporations  such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Goldman Sachs, Nordstrom, Scandinavian  Airlines, British Airways, Philips Electronics, and KPMG International.  In  the final chapter, Laurie poses some of the questions that leaders have  asked him about their work -- and his answers to those questions. Then in  an Epilogue, Laurie offers this advice to leaders: \\"Hold steady, maintain  the focus of your ambition, frame the next leadership challenge, and use  your people as valuable resources as you collectively solve problems and  learn your way into the future. Be decisive and discover the power of  questions.\\" This book will be of substantial value to those now in a  position of leadership but also (if not moreso) to those now aspiring to  such a position.finally, allow people to take risks and support them when they make  mistakes. <br />Laurie agrees with Ronald A.

He suggests, however,  that they are worthless \\"unless they lead to better information or better  ways of doing business. I think that enterprise systems are without doubt  an impressive technical feat, but I am primarily concerned that  organizations get business value from them.\\" Throughout his book, he  addresses key issues such as these:<br />1. What enterprise systems are and  why they are important<br />2. The promise and the perils involved<br />3. How to  decide whether or not to implement enterprise systems<br />4. How to integrate  enterprise systems with strategy and organizational structure<br />5. How to  integrate enterprise systems with business processes and information<br />6.  How to achieve value while implementing enterprise systems<br />7. How to  transform the practice of management with enterprise systems<br />8. How to  use enterprise systems to manage the supply chain<br />9. The future of  ES-enabled organizations<br />As Davenport explains in Chapter 1, \\"Enterprise  systems offer the first great opportunity to achieve true connectivity, a  state in which everyone knows what everyone else is doing in the business  all over the world at the same time. And because they represent the first  great opportunity for connectivity, they pose one of the greatest threats  to the status quo that companies have ever faced.\\" Hence the importance of  one of the the book's most valuable sections, the Appendix, in which  Davenport provides \\"A Technical Overview of Enterprise Systems.\\" Those who  feel threatened by an enterprise system will seize any and all  opportunities to point out its technical flaws. At best, enterprise systems  are complex, difficult to install, and inflexible. However, Davenport  points out, they \\"will remain the most capable, integrated systems in the  history of the world. They may have their flaws, but they are also the  answer to our information systems prayers.\\" I agree.e also the  answer to our information systems prayers.\\" I agree.	2000-08-17

By peak performance [italics] we  mean the norm, better than expected, better than the competition, and  better than similar workforces in other places.\\" These clarifications are  important, especially the reference to \\"sustainable\\", because Katzenbach is  not talking about the \\"hot groups\\" which Lipmen-Blumen and Leavitt analyze  nor the types of groups which Bennis examines in Organizing Genius  [italics].<br />In Chapter 1, Katzenbach suggests four criteria by which to  identify \\"higher-performing workforces. They are: More than one-third of  the workers consistently exceed the expectations of their leaders and  customers, the average worker outperforms the average competitive worker, a  strong emotional commitment to higher standards and aspirations is manifest  throughout the entire workforce, and finally, the collective performance of  that workforce or of critical segments (typically at the front line)  creates the core of the organization's competitive advantage...and is  extremely difficult to copy.<br />Katzenbach organizes his material within  three Parts: Maintaining the Critical Balance, Exploring the Five Balanced  Paths [Mission, Values, and Pride; Process and Metrics; Entrepreneurial  Spirit; Individual Achivement; and Recognition and Celebration], and  Applying the Lessons Learned. He then provides an Appendix in which he  skillfully summarizes key points about 27 \\"Participant Companies and  Organizations\\" and \\"Outside-In Cases\\" which include The Home Depot,  McKinsey &amp; Company, NASA, Southwest Airlines, Toyota, the U.S. Marine  Corps, and the U.S. Navy Seals.<br />It would be a mistake to assume,  however, that Katzenbach has only larger organizations in mind. On the  contrary. If anything, the \\"critical balance\\" between enterprise  performance and employee fulfillment is even more important in  small-to-midsize organizations than it is in organizations such as those  previously listed because, in a smaller organization, an individual worker  can have greater impact...be it positive or negative. For Katzenbach,  having an appropriate \\"critical balance\\" will enable any organization to  \\"stay the course and successfully climb\\" any \\"mountain\\" it may encounter  because it has \\"an emotionally committed, peak-performance workforce.\\"tzenbach has only larger organizations in mind.

After providing a crisp Preface and an  especially helpful Timeline, Solomon and Higgins organize their material  within three Parts: Is There Ultimate Truth?, Faith and Reason, and From  Modernity to Post-Modernism. The authors focus on key concepts without  forcing any comparisons or contrasts between and among the thinkers they  examine. They trace various intellectual traditions (eg Judeo-Christian)  and major periods (eg the Enlightenment), suggesting dominant themes while  allowing their reader to make his or her own connections, to draw her or  his conclusions.

Even without the global challenge, the product development process  has become complex: products [and services] have to not only meet market  requirements but also be manufacturable, reliable, serviceable, useable,  and recyclable, and meet target costs in shorter and shorter cycle times.\\"  If this brief excerpt describes the situation your organization is in now  or one to which it hopes to relocate ASAP, this brilliant book is \\"must  reading.\\"<br />In a very real sense, Galbraith functions as both a management  consultant and  an architect. The emphasis on the principles of \\"design\\" is  intentional and eminently appropriate. Here are some of questions he  answers:<br />What is the challenge of organizational complexity? How to  overcome it?<br />How to organize the global corporation?<br />What are the  levels of international development?<br />What does partnering require? When  and why is it beneficial?<br />What is the significance of geographical  division?<br />Which multidimensional structures are most important?  Why?<br />What are the most effective strategies for coordination between and  among networks?<br />What are cross-border formal networks? What are their  significance?<br />What are the most effective ways to shift power across  networks?<br />What is the \\"transformational form\\"? What is its  significance?<br />What is a \\"multidimensional multinational\\"?<br />What are the  most effective organizational strategies to serve the global  customer?<br />What is a \\"front-back hybrid organization\\"?<br />After \\"A Look  Ahead\\", Galbraith provides an Appendix (\\"The New Global Process of  New-Product Delopment\\") which, all by itself, is well worth the price of  the book. To repeat, I consider it \\"must reading\\" for organizations already  embarked upon globalization or which are now preparing to begin that  perilous journey. There is another category of organizations which can also  derive substantial benefit from this book: Those who now do business with  or plan to do business with others now active in the global marketplace.  With all due respect to Galbraith, there is no single \\"design\\" which is  appropriate for all or even for most organizations. Moreover, today's  appropriate design may well prove inadequate in the near future, if not by  tomorrow. Therefore, I suggest that you use Galbraith's book to identify  the questions which must be asked and then answered, to take full advantage  of the advice he provides and of the guidelines he suggests, and to view  the design process as a unique opportunity to energize (or re-energize)  everyone involved. Galbraith asserts (and I agree) that companies CAN  transform themselves to design local products or devise local services that  capture global scale yet fit local-market requirements.

In  collaboration with others, Perkins briefly reviews the key details of the  \\"Shackleton Saga\\" before shifting his attention (in Part One) to ten  leadership strategies which, he correctly suggests, have direct, indeed  compelling relevance to the contemporary business world. They are:<br />1.  Never lose sight of the ultimate goal, and focus energy on short-term  objectives.<br />2. Set a personal example with visible, memorable symbols and  behavior.<br />3. Instill optimism and self-confidence, but stay grounded in  reality.<br />4. Take care of yourself: Maintain your stamina and let go of  guilt.<br />5. Reinforce the team message constantly: \\"We are one -- we live  or die together.\\"<br />6. Minimize staff differences and insist on courtesy  and mutual respect.<br />7. Master conflict -- deal with anger in small doses,  engage dissidents, and avoid needless power struggles.<br />8. Find something  to celebrate and something to laugh about.<br />9. Be willing to take the Big  Risk.<br />10. Never give up -- there's always another move.<br />Examine any of  today's great organizations and you will encounter an abundance of evidence  of these ten lessons' effectiveness.<br />In Part Two, Perkins provides four  case studies based on Business Communication Systems (AT&amp;T/Lucent  Technologies), Rice Health Systems, Weyerhaeuser Company, and Malden Mills.  The material in Part Three suggests how to \\"lead at the edge\\" and then, in  an Epilogue, Perkins provides his \\"perspective\\" on success and failure.  Part Four consists of various resources: Critical Leadership Skills Survey,  Your Leadership Expedition: A Personal Development Plan, Your Leadership  Expedition Map,  Further Readings from The Edge, and a wealth of notes on  the text.<br />From the time that Ernest Shackleton set sail (December 5,  1914) on the Endurance with his crew of 26 seamen and scientists until he  and his crew finally reached South Georgia (May 10.1916), he steadfastly  followed each of these ten strategies. The challenges encountered along the  way (\\"at the edge\\") are almost beyond comprehension. All of these  challenges are discussed in chilling detail in Caroline Alexander's  brilliant study, The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Anarctic Expedition  (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1999).

But a word of caution: The  cohesive and comprehensive program Hamel presents is NOT for the faint of  heart nor for dimwits.<br />In his Preface, he tells us \\"This is a book  about innovation -- not in the usual sense of new products and new  technologies, but in the sense of radical new business models. It begins by  laying out the revolutionary imperative: we've reached the end of  incrementalism, and only those companies that are capable of creating  industry revolutions will prosper in the new economy. It then provides a  detailed blueprint of what you [italics] can do to get the revolution  started in your own company. Finally, it describes in detail an agenda for  making innovation as ubiquitous a capability as quality or customer  service. Indeed, my central argument is that radical innovation the  [italics] competitive advantage for the new millennium.\\"<br />The material is  carefully organized as follows:<br />Part I  Facing Up to the  Revolution<br />Part II  Finding the Revolution<br />Part III  Igniting  the Revolution<br />Part IV  Sustaining the Revolution<br />Hamel concludes  with these remarks: \\"I began this book with a simple observation -- that  for the first time in history, our heritage is no longer our destiny. Our  dreams are no longer fantasies but possibilities. There isn't a human being  who has ever lived who right now, at this moment so pregnant with promise.  Among all your forebears, among the countless generations who had no hope  of progress, among all those whose spirits were betrayed by progress, you  are the one who now stands on the threshold of -- the age of revolution.  You are blessed beyond belief. Don't falter. Don't hesitate. You were given  the opportunity for a reason. Find it. Lead the revolution.\\"<br />If you  and/or your organization are in the doldrums, this is \\"must reading.\\" But  be forewarned: As Hamel explains so carefully, being a revolutionary is to  be exposed to constant perils. If you are a dimwit or faint of heart, don't  bother to read this book because it was not written for you. Rather, it was  written for many of those with whom you compete: People with courage and  principle. People who are prudent but passionate risk-takers. Those who are  determined to make a difference.

Even the most  successful companies must continually question the basis of their business  and the assumptions underlying their 'formula for success.' (In fact, in  one way or another, this is what most successful companies have done to get  where they are.). New who/what/how positions are constantly popping up  around the mass market, and established companies must be on the lookout  for them.

Indeed, all of Maggio's excellent \\"tools\\" (as well as  her  suggestions as to how to use them effectively) are as relevant to telephone  conversations and e-mails as they are to business and personal letters.  Determine the specific objective to be achieved, organize your thoughts  with meticulous care, and then express them with both precision and  concision. Maggio explains HOW.<br />One of the book's greatest benefits is  that it provides a wealth of \\"choice words, phrases, sentences &amp;  paragraphs for every situation.\\" Here are the first eight of 40 specific  situations, all of which are conveniently listed in alphabetical order:  Acceptances, Acknowledgements, (Letters of) Adjustment, (Letters of)  Advice, Announcements, and Apologies, (Letters About) Appointment  Interviews, and (Letters of) Appreciation. You get the idea.<br />All busy  people should accumulate AND MAKE DAILY USE OF a personal reference  library. Here is an excellent candidate to consider for yours.	2000-08-05

It is chock full of opinions, many of which  you may disagree with. So what? Sarris examines a wide range of subjects  (covering the 1927-1949 timeframe) which are organized within five  chapters:<br />The Hollywood Studios [&quot;The Golden Age&quot; at MGM,  Paramount, Warner Brothers, 20th-Century-Fox, RKO, Universal, and  Columbia]<br />Genres [eg the musical, gangster film, the horror film, the  screwball comedy, the western, the film noir, the war film]<br />Directors [eg  Chaplin, Ford, Hitchcock, Hawks, Welles, Sturges, Wilder, Capra, and  Stevens]<br />Actors and Actresses [eg Garbo, Cagney, Bogart, Davis, Grant,  Bergman, Harlow, Fields, the Marx Brothers, Tracy and Hepburn, and Gable  and Lombard]<br />Guilty Pleasures [eg the &quot;B&quot; picture]<br />Sarris  then provides four appendices: Academy Award nominations and winners  (1927-1949), New York Critics Circle Awards (1935-1949), Best Directors  (1927-1949), and Best Performances (1929-1949). The various lists are  interesting but the book's greatest appeal derives from the comprehensive  coverage of 22 years of the American talking film's history in combination  with Sarris' own opinions about most of those who created that history.<br />I  highly recommend this book to film buffs, not as a definitive history of  the period (there is none) nor as the single best source of film criticism  (there is none); rather, as a collection of thoughtful, generally  well-written essays which inform as well as entertain.<br />If you are a film  buff and if, after reading this book you are motivated to see films you  have not as yet seen or to see once again films you last saw years ago,  Sarris will have achieved what seems to be his primary objective.	2000-08-05

There are dozens of books on this subject, several of which I consider superior to this one (eg Drucker's Managing Change and O'Toole's Leading Change); however, Tucker has made an important contribution by suggesting  and then discussing \\"10 Driving Forces of Change for the Next Century.\\"  They are:<br />* Real-Time Responsiveness<br />* No-Hassle Convenience<br />* Aging  Boomers/Rising Xers<br />* Mass Customized Choice<br />* Lifestyle [Changes]<br />*  Discounting<br />* Value Differentiation<br />* Ultra Service<br />* Techno-Edge<br />*  World-Class Quality<br />Tucker offers thoughtful discussions of these  \\"Driving Forces\\" (devoting a separate chapter to each), including also a  series of mini-case studies based on companies such as Williams-Sonoma,  Dell Computer, Southwest Airlines, and Charles Schwab. Please keep in mind  that Tucker wrote this book almost ten years ago. So much has happened  since, especially because of the Web and globalization initiatives made  possible by it.<br />After a decade, Managing the Future remains a  thoughtful, well-written book of special value to less-experienced  executives. For those on higher levels of management, it may not offer much  that they do not already know but it will certainly help them to clarify  their thinking as they proceed into an uncertain future.	2000-07-17

It must instead find the unique value that it alone can deliver to a chosen market. Why and how this is  done are the two key questions the book addresses.\\" The authors focus with  rigor and precision on three different \\"disciplines\\": operational  excellence, product leadership, and customer intimacy. It remains for any  company (for any organization, for that matter) to determine which of the  three should be its primary discipline but all are obviously  important...indeed interdependent. Nonetheless, one discipline should be  pre-eminent. The authors examine dozens of companies which have  concentrated primarily on one of the three \\"disciplines\\" so that they can  select their customers and then narrow their focus inorder to gain and  sustain dominance within their respective marketplaces. I think this book  will be of substantial value to executives in any organization but of  greatest value to those in organizations which are small-to-midsize. Unless  they have dysfunctional management and/or defective products, their mastery  of that discipline will enable them to compete more effectively against  larger organizations which (obviously) have greater resources available. My  own view is that as B2B and B2B2C continue to increase at exponentially  greater velocity, leadership of ANY market will require mastery of customer  intimacy and at least one (but preferably both) of the other two  disciplines. In that event, the insights which Treacy and Wiersema share  will be even more valuable.	2000-07-16

Scott and then Some	Frankly, I had some reservations as I began to read this book. By now I have become weary of so many books with gimmicky concepts (eg Chicken Soup for Dummies, Caligula on Management) and was pleased to find that Axelrod  has skillfully correlated Patton's expressed ideas on leadership with key  issues in the contemporary business world. Many of those ideas probably  reflect the influence of Sun Tzu and von Clausewitz whom Patton no doubt  studied while a student at V.M.I. (for one year) and then the U.S. Military  Academy at West Point from which he graduated. In any event, this is a  well-written book with solid substance. After a Foreword and Introduction,  Axelrod organizes 183 \\"Strategic Lessons\\" within ten chapters:<br />1. What He  Did and Who He Was (Patton's Achievement and Background)<br />2. \\"A Commander  Will Command\\" (On the Dimensions of Leadership)<br />3. \\"Always Attack, Never  Surrender\\" (On Developing a Winning Attitude)<br />4. \\"How Do We Know That?\\"  (On Fact Finding, Preparation, and Planning)<br />5. \\"Speed -- Simplicity --  Boldness\\" (On Execution and Opportunity)<br />6. \\"The Soldier Is the Army\\" (On  Training, Mentoring, Motivating, and Inspiring)<br />7. \\"Letters of  Instruction\\" ((On Communication and Coordination)<br />8.  \\"Only One Direction  -- Forward\\" (On Creating Efficiency)<br />9. \\"Success Is How High You Can  Bounce When You Hit Bottom\\" (On Courage and Character)<br />10. \\"Audacity\\" (On  Managing the Impossible)<br />I provide the chapter titles and subtitles to  suggest the specific areas in which Axelrod examines Patton's ideas. Patton  remains one of the 20th century's best-known and least-understood military  leaders. Mention his name and most people immediately conjure an image of  George C. Scott whose inspired portrayal provided an accurate but  incomplete representation of Patton. It is worth noting that Patton's  strategies minimized casualties of his own troops while maximizing  destruction of those whom his troops opposed, that he assembled an  extraordinarily talented staff to whom he delegated effectively and whose  members remained steadfastly loyal to him, and that under his leadership  his troops achieved truly stunning results, often with severely limited  resources and under political constraints. There is a great deal to learn  from this man...and Axelrod has done a brilliant job of suggesting what  that is.<br />Axelrod includes a Recommended Readings section to which I  presume to add Puryear's 19 Stars (A Study in Military Character and  Leadership). In it, Puryear examines the careers of George S. Patton, Jr.,  Dwight D. Eisenhower, Douglas MacArthur, and George C. Marshall. You may  also wish to check out Sun Tzu's The Art of War (Oxford University Press)  and von Clausewitz's On War (Penguin).ed, that he assembled an  extraordinarily talented staff to whom he delegated effectively and whose  members remained steadfastly loyal to him, and that under his leadership  his troops achieved truly stunning results, often with severely limited  resources and under political constraints.

Here is an excellent candidate to consider. Fenster has anthologized a wealth of  insights from a diverse range of sources, including several one would not  perhaps think of as \\"great business leaders.\\" For example, Mary Pickford,  Madame C.J. Walker, Clarence Birdseye, and Margaret Rudkin. Of course,  there is a generous selection from the usual sources such as Andrew  Carnegie, Sam Walton, John D. Rockefeller, Albert P. Sloan, Jr., David  Packard, and Herb Kelleher. The quotations are organized within five Parts:<br />Talk About Convincing:  SALESMEN<br />No Stone Left Unturned:  HUSTLING  HARD WORKERS<br />The Thoughts That Count:  SELF-MADE SUCCESSES<br />The Buck  Stops:  BOSSES<br />No Matter What Everyone Else is Doing:  MAVERICKS<br />This  would be a terrific source for material to be included in correspondence,  internal and external newsletters, speeches, business plans, formal  proposals, and multi-media presentations. The same material also offers new  insights or reminders which can help to clarify thoughts, especially during  a problem-solving process. Fenster includes a brief introduction to each  Part and then a brief bio of each great business leader quoted. One of my  personal favorites is what Herb Kelleher says about Perspective: \\"Think  small and act small, and we'll get bigger. Think big and act big, and we'll  get smaller.\\" Some of the hundreds of quotations will be familiar to each  reader...others will not. All are worthy of inclusion in this entertaining  as well as useful collection.	2000-07-16

Its `messiness' lies not  in disorder, but in an order which is unpredictable, spontaneous, and ever  shifting, a pattern created by millions of uncoordinated, independent  decisions....Ours is a magnificently creative era. But that creativity  produces change, and that change attracts enemies, philosophical as well as  self-interested. With some exceptions, the enemies of the future aim their  attacks not at creativity itself but at the dynamic processes through which  it is carried.\\"<br />In the final chapter, Postrel suggests that \\"We live in  an enchanted world, a world suffused with intelligence, a world of our  making. In such plenitude, too, lies an adventurous future.\\" She then  quotes Fredrich Hayek: \\"It is in the process of learning, in the effects of  having learned something new, that man enjoys the gift of his  intelligence.\\" Postrel responds: \\"It is in curiosity, problem solving, and  play that we discover who we are. These are the very qualities and  activities that make the future unknown and unknowable....We cannot build a  single bridge from here to there, for neither here nor there is a single  point. And there is no abyss to cross.\\"<br />On occasion, I include excerpts  in my review because those who read reviews online do not have direct  access to the text, as they would if browsing in a bookstore. In this  instance, I include excerpts to suggest the seriousness of the issues which  Postrel addresses in this brilliant book. There have always been \\"enemies  of the future\\" (for reasons which Postrel addresses effectively) and there  always will be. Peter Drucker once observed that one of the greatest  challenges now facing organizations is to recognize and then manage the  implications and consequences of a future which has already occurred. In  Now or Never, Mary Modahl emphasizes the importance of rapid response to  those opportunities which change creates.<br />I am in great debt to Postrel  and others who continue to remind us how perilous the future can indeed be  but also how imperative it is to approach that future with passion as well  as prudence...and especially, with a sense of delight...as we explore our  global community, of course, but as we also seek out what is yet to be  revealed within our hearts and minds.Now or Never, Mary Modahl emphasizes the importance of rapid response to  those opportunities which change creates. <br />I am in great debt to Postrel  and others who continue to remind us how perilous the future can indeed be  but also how imperative it is to approach that future with passion as well  as prudence...and especially, with a sense of delight...as we explore our  global community, of course, but as we also seek out what is yet to be  revealed within our hearts and minds.	2000-07-14

When I later asked my professor about it, he explained that Trilby was in  fact a bestseller after its publication (in 1894) but that its only claim  to literary fame is that it introduces a character named Svengali. I  recalled that conversation as I began to read Pick's book. It is a  brilliant achievement. The \\"web\\" to which the title refers consists of all  manner of connections between hypnotism and anti-Semitism. Those  connections are presumably what attracted Pick to Trilby and, especially,  to the implications of the novel's great success in Victorian  England.<br />Centuries earlier in A Merchant in Venice, Shakespeare  introduced a usurer named Shylock who was viewed with contempt by most of  the other characters. Revealingly, only Shylock fully honors all of the  terms and conditions in his financial transactions to which others  voluntarily (indeed eagerly) agree and yet he is reviled. Indeed, he is the  principal victim in the play and yet, even today, is often viewed as the  villain...usually by those who have not read the play or at least not read  it with care. Shylock's name remains synonymous with unscrupulous  money-lenders. Perhaps Pick had this in mind as he began to examine the  character Svengali whose name is synonymous with hypnotic, almost  irresistible evil. In any event, with consummate skill, Pick uses Svengali  as a focal point through which to examine all manner of social and  political forces at work in late-19th century England. In our own age when  so many movies seem to be made primarily to sell merchandise, the \\"Trilby  Phenomenon\\" also suggests commercial implications of mesmerizing  significance.	2000-07-14

For example the first thesis asserts that \\"Markets are conversations\\", also the title of  Chapter 4; the last thesis asserts that \\"We are waking up and linking to  each other. We are watching. But we are not waiting.\\" That is to say, the  Internet and the Web have created unique, indeed unprecedented  opportunities for conversations between and among people almost anywhere,  anytime. So much has already been said and written about technological  connectivity and interaction. The Cluetrain Manifesto provides a wealth of  insights concerning connectivity and interaction in human terms,  connectivity which is permitted by technology but not dependent on  institutional ventriloquists. Of course, all this is occurring in so-called  nanoseconds. (Check out Guy Claxton's Hare Brain Tortoise Mind for some  thought-provoking perspectives on the concept of time.) The authors  obviously do not expect their readers to agree with every thesis. Indeed, I  suspect, they would be upset if any one reader does. In effect, they say  \\"Rigorously consider what we suggest and then formulate your own theses.\\"  Their book combines a cordial invitation to think with a passionate  imperative to care.	2000-07-14

If you are looking for a single-volume source, this is probably one of the best. The authors devote  14 chapters to virtually all aspects of M&amp;A. In process, with clarity  and eloquence, they explain the \\"Watson Wyatt Deal Flow Model\\" which, after  appropriate modifications, can be applied to almost any organization  involved in M&amp;A negotiations, either as a buyer or as a seller. The  final chapter, all by itself, is well worth the cost of the book. In it,  the authors suggest various \\"keys\\" to M&amp;A success. They then  provide:<br />Resource A: Sample Task Force Charter<br />Resource B: Integration  Planning Template<br />Resource C: Executive Summary of Watson Wyatt  Worldwide's 1998-1999 Mergers and Acquisitions Survey<br />What we have here  is a single-volume in which two experts on the subject of M&amp;A seem to  share everything they know about the subject. Even if your company is not  currently a buyer or seller, its senior-level executives should  read this  book. Why? Because you just never know. Perhaps sooner than now  anticipated, your company will be courted by another...or it will be  attracted to another company as a prospective acquisition. In either  situation, this book (and the \\"Watson Wyatt Deal Flow Model\\" it discusses)  will be invaluable.	2000-07-14

Hawkins: \\"Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations...However, if we do discover a complete theory, it should in time  be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few  scientists....[We can then] take part in the discussion of of the questions  of why it is that we and universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it  would be the ultimate triumph of human reason reason -- for then we would  know the mind of God.\\"<br />This book was written for the reasonably  intelligent non-scientist who shares the authors' curiosity about matters  such as these:<br />*  Over the centuries, why have so many great minds  attempted to formulate a \\"unification theory\\" which accommodates the  totality of what is known about the universe?<br />*  As a results of such  efforts, what have been the major breakthroughs in  understanding the  universe? For example, what are the specific contributions of the ancient  Greeks, Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, and Einstein?<br />The  authors observe: \\"Our purpose here is to focus on the state of physics, for  that is where the search for unity is currently being pursued the most  actively and has been rewarded with the greatest achievements in the realms  of both the infinitely large and the infinitesimally small.\\" In all  probability, this book will not be of great interest to everyone. I  recommend it highly to the aforementioned \\"reasonably intelligent  non-scientist\\" who is curious to learn more about the evolution of  intellectual history, and especially the evolution of the history of  science during which physics has played such an important part.	2000-07-14

Meyer's distinguished career includes serving as associate editor of Fortune magazine (primarily responsible for coverage of the U.S.S.R.) and then as special assistant to the director of the C.I.A. and vice chairman of the C.I.A.'s National Intelligence Council (primarily responsible for  estimates and projections concerning the U.S.S.R.). Meyer is widely  recognized as the first senior government official to predict the collapse  of the U.S.S.R. Upon retirement from public service, Meyer founded  Real*World Intelligence, Inc. of which he continues to serve as chairman  and CEO. He is widely recognized as a leading authority on competitive  intelligence. He and his associates developed the world's first customized  turn-key intelligence system for organizations and they now work with  clients throughout the world.<br />There are many misconceptions about the  C.I.A. For example, contrary to what many people think, only a small  percentage of time and effort (about 5%) is devoted to espionage (or  \\"spying\\"). Most of the work consists of obtaining and then evaluating  \\"open-book\\" information. That is, information readily available to  virtually anyone. There may also be misconceptions about the subject of  Meyer's book, competitive intelligence. For example, that efforts to obtain  the information on which it depends must necessarily be illegal, unethical,  immoral, etc. Not so. As Meyer carefully explains, there is an abundance of  information in the public domain which is easily (and legally) accessible.  In Real*World Intelligence, Meyer organizes his material within six  chapters:<br />The Most Powerful Management Tool of All<br />The New  Intelligence<br />How Intelligence Works<br />What Intelligence Outfits Look  Like<br />Intelligence and Policymaking<br />The Future of Intelligence<br />What he  offers in this book is a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective system  by which to determine (a) which information is of greatest importance to an  organization, (b) how to obtain that information and then manage it, (c)  how to convert (or upgrade) that information to intelligence, and finally  (d) how to derive greatest benefit from it.<br />In the so-called Age of  Information, it is imperative for any organization (regardless of size or  nature) to establish and then develop such a system. Think of intelligence  as \\"radar\\" which will enable an organization to survey and then navigate  its way through totally unfamiliar \\"territory.\\" Think of intelligence as a  means by which to recognize critically important early-warning signs and  then respond effectively to them. Also think of intelligence as a means by  which to know what an organization needs to know about its competitors but,  much more importantly, what it needs to know about its customers and their  customers as well as what it needs to know about the rapidly-changing world  it shares with them.<br />Anyone who questions the importance of such  intelligence should ask this question: \\"The next time I am behind the wheel  of a vehicle, what if I were wearing a blindfold as I pull out into  traffic?\\" Obviously that makes no sense and yet many organizations are now  wear a blindfold as they proceed into an uncertain future.

He is quite correct when expressing concern about what we both view as abuses of  the Fourth Amendment, especially in recent years because of the WWW. I also  agree with him that, in a litigious society, the sexual-harassment law has  motivated many people to assert that all forms of offensive behavior are  ipso facto illegal. But has privacy been destroyed or, at least, is it in  imminent danger of being destroyed? I don't think so. I define privacy to  include thoughts and feelings to which we can control access by another  person. There are certain areas within the human mind and heart which can  never be penetrated by an electronic device. However unwelcome an \\"unwanted  gaze\\" may be, however offensive or even illegal another person's behavior  may be, one's private or personal \\"space\\" need not be penetrated...unless  with permission. Rosen raises a number of important issues. He supports his  assertions (especially those concerning the sexual-harassment law) with  solid examples. I share his concern about abuses of information which have  been made possible by various electronic devices. I share his contempt for  any behavior which violates human dignity.<br />As previously indicated, my  definition of privacy is apparently more inclusive than is his. We also  seem to differ on the purpose of privacy. For Rosen, privacy is defined by  \\"social boundaries that protect us from being simplified and objectified  and judged out of context.\\" For me, privacy exists within four different  dimensions (physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual) and its purpose is  to help define one's identity and nourish one's dignity. Laws should  protect us from threats which are illegal...and social rejection should  protect us from threats which are offensive. What are your own thoughts  about all this? Read Rosen's book. You may have your own disagreements with  him on certain points but I think you will share my appreciation of the  information and opinions he shares.wn disagreements with  him on certain points but I think you will share my appreciation of the  information and opinions he shares.	2000-06-06

Once we understand the capabilities of a given device,  we discover all manner of uses for it.

He organizes the material within nine chapters: The Truth Behind the Cisco Legend (1984-1987), The Morgridge  Years (1988-1995), The Inner Chambers (1977-1995), The Benevolent Predator  (1996), A Day in the Life, Routing the Industry (1997-1998), The Virtual  Corporation (1997-Present), The New Battle (1996-1998), and Giving Cisco a  Voice (1998-Present). Note the digressions from the traditional  chronological narrative. The reasons for each digression become obvious as  Bunnell carefully guides his reader through a wealth of information.<br />Periodically, Bunnell pauses to share his own opinion of a given  situation or circumstance. He tells a compelling \\"story\\" of the creation  and subsequent development of Cisco Systems. There is no shortage of key  \\"characters\\", notably Sandra Lerner and Leonard Bosack (co-founders), Bill  Yeager, Kirk Lougheed, Don Valentine, John Morgridge, John Chambers, Ed  Kozel, and Don Listwin. They and others have played a key role but  Morgridge and (especially) Chambers receive most of Bunnell's attention  because their contributions have proven to be most important to the  corporation's success. Chambers remains CEO.<br />Much as I was impressed by  the flow of the narrative, I especially enjoyed Bunnell's own comments.  Here four brief examples:<br />\\"Chambers has the characteristics of a Mafia  don (at least as popularized by Marlon Brando. He makes no distinction  between personal values and corporate ones. He has a team of fantastically  loyal people. He recognizes the significance of minor actions as an  expression of larger motivations. Although he encourages team play,  dissent, and discussion, he is the ultimate decision maker.\\"<br />\\"For  Chambers, there are five keys to selecting the right acquisitions: Share a  common vision, be culturally compatible, provide a quick win for  shareholders, provide a long-term strategic win for all four  constituencies, and be geographically desirable.\\"<br />\\"Teamwork is paramount  in an organization whose size and growth demand it. The more decentralized  Cisco's organization becomes, the more any semblance of management depends  on empowered individuals working together under the benevolent command if  Cisco's corporate leaders.\\"<br />\\"The world Cisco faces at the turn of the  millennium parallels the one that first propelled Cisco to success. It's a  world of incompatible protocols, preventing people from communicating. This  time, people want their phones, televisions, and computers to talk to each  other. Cisco has moved to provide the consumer product equivalent of its  original multiprotocol router -- the media gateway, which can connect phone  networks of various types to the various data networks.\\"<br />Bunnell has told  the Cisco \\"story\\" until now...and he has told it well. What we learn about  Cisco Systems is almost exactly what we learn about the global marketplace  in which this corporation competes. To a significant extent, Cisco Systems  has defined that marketplace and, in all probability, will continue to do  so. But don't tell John Chambers that. He is well aware that another  \\"small, innovative company could come along -- unburdened by hype. huge  product lines, and an organization of thousands -- to become the next  [italics] company of the future.\\" It's happened before...and will probably  happen again.tegic win for all four  constituencies, and be geographically desirable.\\"<br />\\"Teamwork is paramount  in an organization whose size and growth demand it.

Daley - His Battle for Chicago and the Nation	Books	4	25	30	N	N	Unanswered Questions	Born and raised in Chicago, I have always been fascinated by the personal life and public career of Richard J. Daley, arguably the city's greatest mayor whose son Richard now serves in that office. Years ago, in his book  about Daley, Mike Royko suggested at least some of the parameters within  which Cohen and Taylor now analyze \\"The Boss.\\" They provide a wealth of  information. I would have rated this biography higher had the authors  probed more deeply into much of that material inorder to answer so many  questions I still have about Daley.<br />For example, what do Daley's  successes and failures as a public servant reveal about the political and  social worlds in which they occurred? During the years he served as mayor,  could he have achieved these same successes without maintaining absolute  control of the city's political system? What did Daley share in common with  those in control of the Chicago syndicate? To what extent were there  strategic alliances with them? Why? If Daley was as corrupt as so many have  claimed, why has no incontrovertible evidence of that corruption been  presented?<br />The authors have much to say about Daley's relationship  with Chicago's black community. This was an uneasy, at times hostile  relationship. To what extent was Daley's leadership as mayor a reflection  of the community (Bridgeport) in which he was born and raised? Did he hate  blacks? Did he fear them? Or is there another explanation of his attitude  toward them? Ancient pharaohs were on occasion benevolent to those whom  they viewed as inferior as were, more recently, plantation owners in the  Deep South. Perhaps Cohen and Taylor had this in mind when they selected  their title.<br />As I recall Daley, he was a master of negotiation when  seeking to achieve his objectives but never hesitated to be ruthless  whenever it served his purposes. As county chairman, he once summoned an  immensely popular incumbent mayor to his office and then, after letting him  cool his heals, informed him that he would not seek re-election. Daley was  now ready to assume that office. I wish the authors had been more objective  when analyzing what I would characterize as Daley's pragmatism.<br />These  are some of the questions which American Pharaoh raises in my mind. Perhaps  there will be other books (yet to be written) which attempt to answer them.  Nonetheless, I am grateful to Cohen and Taylor for helping me to understand  better than I did before one of the 20th century's most fascinating  political leaders.s heals, informed him that he would not seek re-election.

This brilliant book explains why. The authors enable us to \\"revisit\\" the unique achievements of  someone who is too often under-appreciated or, worse yet, ignored.  According to Peter Drucker, \\"With every passing year, McGregor's message  becomes ever more relevant, more timely, and more important.\\" The material  is organized as follows:<br />Part 1  Why McGregor Matters<br />Part 2  Selected  Essays of Douglas McGregor<br />In the first part, the authors provide a  brilliant introduction to the essays which then follow. They quote  liberally from McGregor's classic work, The Human Side of Enterprise.  Perhaps you are already familiar with Robert Owen (1771-1858) whom James  O'Toole characterizes as \\"the Thomas Edison of social invention. He was the  first to devise or advocate numerous practices in industrial relations,  education, and social policy that are still considered progressive today,  more than 130 years after his death.\\" More than a century later, McGregor  addresses many of the same issues which Owen did. For example:<br />1.  Creating a workplace in which people are treated as human beings<br />2.  Offering incentives and rewards which enable people to motivate themselves  to produce work of consistently high quality<br />3.  Viewing the work force  as an investment, not as a cost<br />4.  Supporting and nourishing the  personal as well as professional development of  that work force<br />5.  Formulating means by which to measure worker performance accurately...and  fairly<br />Here is a brief excerpt from The Human Side of Enterprise:<br />\\"The  outstanding fact about relationships in the modern industrial organization  is that they involve a high degree of interdependence. Not only are  subordinates dependent upon those above them in the organization for  satisfying their needs and achieving their goals, but managers at every  level are dependent upon all those below them for achieving their own and  organizational goals.\\"<br />These observations by McGregor explain why it is  no coincidence that, year after year, the companies rated \\"the best to work  for\\" are the same companies which dominate their respective industries, the  same companies which have the greatest market value.<br />In his various  works, McGregor devotes substantial attention to two different theories  which \\"are not managerial strategies. They are underlying beliefs about the  nature of man that influence managers to adopt one strategy rather than  another.\\" The core assumptions of Theory X are that (1) managers alone must  organize and control the work to be done, (2) workers must totally  subordinate their needs to those of the organization, (3) without strict  supervision, workers would be indifferent (perhaps resistant) to the  organization's needs because (4) the average worker is indolent, lacks  ambition, prefers to be supervised,  is self-centered, and dislikes  change.<br />The core assumptions of Theory Y are that (1) \\"People are not by  nature passive or resistant to organizational needs.\\", (2) \\"The motivation,  the potential for development, the capacity for assuming responsibility,  the readiness to direct behavior toward organizational goals are all  present in people. Management does not put them there.\\", (3) \\"It is the  responsibility of management to make it possible to recognize and develop  these human characteristics for themselves.\\", and (4) \\"The essential task  of management is to arrange organization conditions and operation so that  people can achieve their own goals best [italics] by directing their own  [italics] efforts toward organizational objectives.\\"<br />Thanks to Heil,  Bennis, and Stephens, we now have in a single volume both a brilliant  analysis of McGregor's ideas as well as an analysis of the implications of  those ideas, and, a selection of McGregor's essays in which those ideas are  introduced and developed. Who will gain the greatest value from this book?  Those who now know little (if anything) about one of the most influential  business thinkers. I agree with Drucker that, \\"With each passing year,  McGregor's message becomes ever more relevant, more timely, and more  important.\\"  I presume to suggest that that will continue to be true so  long as there are organizations in which human beings have work to do.eas are  introduced and developed.

It continues to amaze me that so many people who invest substantial amounts of hours and dollars in a physical fitness program invest little (if anything) in a career fitness program. For the modest cost of this  book, a cohesive and comprehensive career fitness program is now available.  The excellent text is accompanied by a floppy disk.

He was the first to devise or advocate numerous practices in  industrial relations, education, and social policy that are still  considered progressive today, more than 130 years after his death.\\" In The  New Pioneers, Petzinger focuses on the contemporary world in which a  \\"revolution\\" is now underway in business, \\"for the most part invisible in  the headlines and the boardrooms, but dizzying in its effect on the front  lines.\\" Much of what he discusses is directly relevant to Owen's  initiatives. He agrees with Abraham Maslow that \\"the most valuable one  hundred people to a deteriorating society\\" would be entrepreneurs because  \\"the arrow of evolution flies toward the pioneering.\\"<br />Over the years, I  have learned a great deal from reading Petzinger's column in the Wall  Street Journal, \\"The Front Lines.\\" He is constantly alert to subtle but  potentially significant developments within and beyond the ever-changing  workplace. The material he shares in this brilliant book is drawn from \\"the  front lines\\" of companies based in more than 40 cities in 30 states as well  as several companies in foreign countries.<br />I highly recommend this book  to anyone who seeks answers to questions such as these:<br />1. Which \\"new  frontiers\\" offer the greatest opportunities for institutional growth and  human development?<br />2. Which economies of scale are most relevant to such  growth?<br />3. To optimize development of &quot;human capital&quot; in  small-to-midsize organizations, which strategies (eg incentives and  rewards) work best?<br />4. Which of these strategies will also be effective  in larger organizations?<br />5. Amidst turbulent change caused by new  technologies, which traditional values will enable any organization to  nourish its \\"human systems\\"?<br />To succeed in what he calls \\"The Age of  Adaptation\\" (the subject of his Introduction), Petzinger asserts that  organizations (regardless of size or nature) must cope effectively with  certain \\"new realities\\" which serve as the subtitles of the book's ten  chapters. For example: \\"Trade and technology are fundamentally human\\", \\"Why  the new rules favor the small and connected\\", \\"The customer is the common  denominator\\", and \\"Knowledge and self-organization flourish at the edge of  chaos.\\"  It is important to reiterate that Petzinger's observations and  assertions are based on a wealth of real-world experience. He is firmly  convinced that \\"We, our tools, and the businesses by which we accomplish  nearly everything are all products of the natural world.\\" Although granting  that \\"Wrong turns and backsliding will occur from time to time\\", Petzinger  is convinced that each new age will produce another generation of  \\"pioneers\\" who will continue to transform a global marketplace which is  rapidly becoming the same workplace for nearly everyone.subject of his Introduction), Petzinger asserts that  organizations (regardless of size or nature) must cope effectively with  certain \\"new realities\\" which serve as the subtitles of the book's ten  chapters.

Chick's  approach to Ravelstein is described as a \\"piecemeal method\\": the provision  of an ever-expanding accumulation of interactions between and among the  most important people in Ravelstein's life as well as their interactions  with Ravelstein himself. We learn that Ravelstein asked Chick to write a  biography of him in the form of a memoir. Chick concentrates on countless  memories of his friend. He and Ravelstein take turns being the focal point  of the narrative. There is very little physical action...but a great deal  of intellectual and emotional activity, especially as Ravelstein's health  deteriorates. (He is dying of AIDS.) If you share my high regard for  Bellow's previous works, this is a \\"must read.\\" Other reviewers have  referred to Oates's Blonde as \\"pathography\\" and the same can be said of  Ravelstein. At which point does it cease to be a biography (or memoir) and  becomes a novel? I couldn't care less. This may not be Bellow's finest work  but I would be hard-pressed to suggest another which has greater  intellectual depth and richer emotional texture.	2000-05-22

Oates has obviously completed a great deal of research on the life and times of Marilyn Monroe. Most people believe that she either committed suicide or accidentally died of a drug overdose. Oates suggests that she  was murdered. So Blonde is essentially a murder mystery. Who did it? And  why? Oates brings all of her formidable talents to bear as she develops her  characters and her plot. In process, as the character and personality of  The Blonde are revealed to the reader, they suggest that there was far more  depth and complexity to the woman than her enduring public persona  suggests. True, she was often victimized by those whom she loved and  trusted (eg The President). However, as portrayed by Oates, she was also  ambitious, cunning, and manipulative. Eventually she became a threat which  had to be eliminated. And in the Oates account, she was.<br />Other reviewers  have referred to Oates's Blonde as \\"pathography\\" and the same can also be  said of Bellow's Ravelstein.

Great Minds of Business	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Direct Access to Five Great Business Minds	Perhaps you saw one or more of the programs in the PBS series. If so, then you will especially want to have a copy of the interviews on which that excellent series was based. If you saw none of the programs, here is the  \\"companion\\" to them. The executives interviewed:<br />Andrew Grove (Chairman  and CEO, Intel Corporation)<br />Fred Smith (Founder and CEO, Federal Express  Corporation)<br />Peter Lynch (Former Manager, Fidelity Magellan  Fund)<br />Pleasant Rowland (Founder and President, Pleasant Company)<br />Paul  Volcker (Former Chairman of the Federal Reserve System)<br />Gretchen  Morgenson has done a skillful job of assembling and editing the material  produced by the five interviews. What I am especially pleased about is that  the tone of each is informal but the responses to questions are crisp and  insightful. The questions asked are probably the same ones you would ask if  you could sit down with each of the five, one-on-one. For example, here is  a brief excerpt from the Smith interview:<br />Q:  Can that view or  perspective [ie one which differs from traditional wisdom] be learned or  can it be taught? Or is this something you think you are born with?<br />A:  I  think there's a lot of luck and I think it's probably intuitive that's  mostly there to begin with. I do think that you can teach people to think  in those [non-traditional] channels, however. One of my favorite terms is  \\"Kaleidoscope Thinking,\\" which I believe was coined by the former editor of  the Harvard Business Review, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, and what she was trying  to get across with that phrase is of you have a business problem and you  turn the kaleidoscope a it over, then sometimes perhaps you'll see it in a  slightly different form than you had seen it traditionally....That I think  you can learn. And whether you're interested in doing it, that's something  else.<br />\\"Kaleidoscope Thinking\\" helped Fred Smith to conceive of what  eventually became Federal Express. The same thinking process also helped  him and his associates to make that concept a reality.<br />I highly recommend  this book to anyone who wants the next best thing to having a one-on-one  conversation with each of five of the greatest business thinkers in the  late-20th century.

Does this mean that there are no scruples in that \\"world\\"? I read dusk jackets as well as the books they embrace. Consider this excerpt: \\"In this stunning expose of some of the most prestigious and respected names in the business, Pinault takes his readers by the hand and leads them into a world where a client's interests are skillfully subordinated to those of the consultants, where money rules the day, and where principles and morals are but unwelcome baggage.\\" Hmmmmmm....<br />Pinault's credentials are impressive: the Boston Consulting Group in the U.S. and Japan, Gemini Consulting throughout Europe and Asia, and Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Hong Kong. Are we to understand that, at least in these \\"prestigious and respected\\" firms, \\"principles and morals are but unwelcome baggage\\"? And even if true, are we then to believe that the same is also true of other \\"prestigious and respected\\" firms? Hmmmmmm....<br />To insist that the opposite is true would also be absurd: That all global consulting firms assign the greatest importance and highest value to the interests of their clients, that money never \\"rules the day\\", and that the principles and morals of these firms are impeccable.<br />Pinault constantly refers to \\"demons.\\" Even when concluding his book, he observes \\"Perhaps the demons are not done with me yet.\\" Who are they? Also, where are they? I am willing to accept on faith that Pinault experienced everything he shares in the book. I am also willing to accept on faith that many of those with whom he was associated were unscrupulous.<br />This book is an \\"expose\\" but not of the totality of global management consulting nor of any of the firms which once employed Pinault.

Specifically, it is not a history of China nor of that country's business history; nor is it a definitive guide to business protocol when doing business with the People's  Republic of China (PRC); nor does it suggest specific strategies and  tactics which ensure \\"business success\\" in that vast country. True,  Stuttard discusses several \\"secrets\\" and they are well worth knowing.  However, you should view this book as a primer. As such, it can be of  substantial value.<br />Until recently serving as chairman of  PricewaterhouseCoopers China, Stuttard was uniquely situated to accumulate  the information and insights which he shares in this slender but solid  book. He and his associates advised more than half of the global companies  then operating in the PRC. With precision and concision, he explains the  importance of issues such as these:<br />*  Comprehensive research and due  diligence prior to involvement in the PRC<br />*  Criteria for the selection  of a joint venture partner<br />*  Flexibility of approach and willingness to  adapt<br />*  Criteria for selection of expatriate managers<br />*  \\"Localization\\"<br />*  Compatibility of cultural values<br />*  The role of  trust<br />*  Cost management and accountability<br />*  The importance (and  significance) of a long-term commitment<br />For me, one of the book's  greatest strengths (among many) is the inclusion of information Stuttard  and his associates obtained from chairmen of 11 different multinational  corporations now doing business in China. Their collective experiences  reveal the most common misconceptions about the market, the competition  (both internal and external), the regulatory environment, the role of  government, and the concept of \\"partnership.\\"<br />If you need a  single-volume source of practical advice about doing business in the PRC  today, look no further.	2000-05-17

This is one of the best. Mills explains \\"how to command attention, change minds, and influence people.\\" His writing style is crisp, his material is very  well organized, he includes an abundance of examples to illustrate his key  points, and he concludes the book with an analysis of \\"the most influential  persuaders of the twentieth century\\", Franklin Roosevelt and Winston  Churchill. The book consists of four Parts:<br />How Persuasion Works (eg  four patterns of influence)  Thoughtful Persuasion (eg how to build trust  and sell your expertise, how to give words added impact)<br />Mindless  Influence (eg the seven \\"persuasion triggers\\" of automatic  influence)<br />Persuasion at Its Best (ie Roosevelt and Churchill)<br />One of  Mills's most effective devices is the checklist. Throughout the book, it  enables him to summarize key points in appropriate clusters. This is  especially helpful for future reference, after the book has been read and  functions as a reference source.<br />This book will be invaluable to you if  you want to strengthen your ability to \\"command attention, change minds,  and influence people.\\" It will also be invaluable to you when interacting  with others who have also read Mills's book and are applying what the  learned.	2000-05-17
2475161:US	51147790	R2VA01YT4RJ28B	0738202762	543814854	You Can't Eat GNP: Economics As If Ecology Mattered	Books	5	23	23	N	N	Redefining Global Priorities	The title is explained in Chapter 1 when Davidson examines three fallacies of the current mainstream economic and technological model. At least one economist has argued that there is no need to worry about global warning  because the only sector of the economy affected by it -- agriculture --  contributes only 3% of the United States' GNP. Davidson observes: \\"Like  Marie Antoinette's suggestion that the French peasants without bread could  eat cake [more accurately, crumbs from a bread pan], this view of how the  world works seems to suggest that if the crops fail, the people could eat  the 97% of the GNP which remains.\\" This is Fallacy #1: \\"Marie Antoinette  Economics.\\"<br />The second fallacy naively asserts that the technological  \\"cavalry\\" will come over the hill in time to save us from economic  disaster; the third fallacy incorrectly assumes that, because of certain  modest improvements of the quality of air and water, environmental  pollution is no longer a serious problem. Davidson's purpose is to examine  the implications and consequences of these fallacies. He believes (and I  wholeheartedly agree) that economic realities and environmental imperatives  are NOT mutually exclusive; on the contrary, they are interdependent.<br />One  bestselling tee-shirt proclaims \\"We're Having a Great Time Spending Our  Children's Inheritance!\\" In a sense, that is what Davidson has in mind when  lamenting the relentless depletion of the earth's natural resources to  achieve short-term financial objectives. To illustrate his key points, he  introduces two pyramids in Chapter 2. One shows how dependent we are on a  stable resource as our base; the second (inverted) pyramid shows how the  principle of supply and demand results in a relentless reduction of that  base. According to Davidson, the priorities of ecology and economics can be  accommodated if certain prudent national and international measures are  initiated and then sustained. These he proposes in Chapter 9:<br />1.  Stop  building new roads.<br />2. Eliminate tax reductions for more than two  children in countries that have income taxes.<br />3.  Reduce taxes on income  and increase taxes on consumption.<br />4. Eliminate governmental subsidies,  such as water projects that hinder the market forces that would otherwise  promote water conservation, more prudent use of groundwater, and prevent  soil salinization.<br />5. Support governmental and nongovernmental extension  efforts to encourage farmers in both industrialized and developing  countries to make more efficient use of their land while conserving soil  and using only essential quantities of fertilizers and pesticides.<br />6.  Eliminate governmental subsidies for industrial fisheries and foster  agreements among nations and among and within communities to protect the  fisheries commons.  7. Ratify and enforce the binding international  agreement reached in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997 reducing greenhouse gas  emissions.<br />8.  Negotiate international agreements on maintaining forest  cover and managing forests to maximize genetic diversity of plants and  animals.<br />What if we don't take these and other initiatives? Davidson has  written this book in direct response to that question. In ways and to an  extent many of us do not realize, there has been an on-going process of  discounting, devaluing, and degrading the earth's environment. Davidson is  somewhat encouraged by certain developments (albeit isolated and  inadequate) which suggest that there is at least some increased awareness  of the various problems. He is fully aware of the great difficulty of  changing the minds of policymakers, business leaders, voters, and consumers  by helping them to understand -- and properly value -- the \\"essential  links\\" between ecology and economics. Davidson makes a substantial  contribution to the achievement of that objective.<br />If you share my high  regard for this book, I suggest that you check out Natural Capitalism, The  Lexus and the Olive Tree, and Holding On to Reality..Lexus and the Olive Tree, and Holding On to Reality..	2000-05-17

Since it was first published, this book has become a \\"must read\\" for those who are struggling to understand what is happening and, more to the point, what will probably be happening in the global marketplace. Drucker has  suggested that one of the greatest challenges for any organization is to  manage the consequences and implications of a future which has already  occurred. I agree. However, I also agree with Barker that it is possible to  recognize what he calls a \\"paradigm shift\\": a major change of the rules and  regulations that establish or define boundaries, a change which suggests  that new behavior will be required within those redefined boundaries.<br />One  of the most important concepts in the book is what Barker calls \\"paradigm  pliancy\\": \\"the purposeful seeking out of new ways of doing things. It is an  active behavior in which you challenge your paradigms [ie the status quo,  assumptions and premises] by asking the Paradigm Shift Question: What do I  believe is impossible to do in my field, but if it could be done, would  fundamentally change my business?\\" Have you asked this question? Do you  realize that one or more of your competitors may have already asked that  question? <br />Although the book's subtitle is \\"The Business of Discovering  the Future\\", the fact remains that (back to Drucker) the challenge is to  identity and then measure the degree of probability of various  contingencies...many of which may have already occurred or are now in  process.<br />Barker asserts that every organization must anticipate and then  innovate to achieve excellence in an age during which change is the only  constant. He suggests that there are five components to \\"strategic  exploration&quot;: Understanding influences which shape our perceptions,  divergent thinking which enables us to consider more than \\"one right  answer\\", convergent thinking which enables us to integrate data while  prioritizing choices, mapping which reveals pathways from the present to  thefuture, and finally, imaging which (with words or drawings or models)  documents what is learned during the process of exploration.<br />This is a  business \\"classic\\" which will continue to be relevant so long as leaders of  organizations remain hostage to assumptions and premises which are either  already obsolete now or will soon become so. What about yours?	2000-05-16

Part  Two (\\"Resources and Applications\\") focuses on growth and domination of  markets, creation and leadership of new markets, management of human  capital, the role of technology, and then -- in the 12th and final chapter  -- \\"Warp-Speed Growth: Managing a Business Built for Speed.\\"<br />In the  final chapter, Meyer provides Chart 12-1, \\"Platform chart for sustainable  warp-speed growth\\" which is first-rate. It correlates all of his key  concepts previously discussed in Chapters 1-12 while suggesting a framework  within which any organization can more effectively organize its own key  information. \\"Where Do You Start?\\" Meyer suggests that you invest time to  define success criteria and limit options. Next, consider creating and then  dominating an entirely new market. Meanwhile, balance your resources as you  formulate a strategic plan for their allocation. As that plan is  implemented, be constantly alert to better ways in which to invest your  resources. Finally, enjoy yourself: \\"The rewards of sustainable growth  should be personal as well as corporate.\\"<br />Perhaps your organization is  currently experiencing little (if any) growth. Perhaps \\"sluggish\\" correctly  describes its usual response to new opportunities, customer problems, a  competitor's initiatives, changes in the marketplace, etc. Perhaps your  organization needs to eliminate clutter, confusion, stagnation, and  complacency. If any of this is true, Peter Meyer's book can be helpful.  However, I presume to offer a few caveats:<br />1. The more serious the  problems you seek to solve, the more difficult it will be to solve them.  Hence the importance of strategic priorities.<br />2. Also, the worst problems  have probably been caused by your own people, many of whom may still be  around. Guess who will be most resistant to change?<br />3.  \\"Warp-Speed  Growth\\" must be prudent growth.<br />4.  It is far easier to attain  \\"Warp-Speed\\" but than it is to sustain it. Unless you and your organization  are both willing and able to make a long-term commitment, forget it.<br />5.  Finally, as Meyer repeatedly emphasizes, an organization's most valuable  resources are its time, people, and money. They must be managed and  conserved BY EVERYONE INVOLVED with meticulous care.<br />Of course, it is  possible for an organization to attain and then sustain \\"Warp Speed\\" but be  headed in the wrong direction. In ancient Rome, a traveler was often asked  \\"Quo vadis?\\" Where are you going?

Hence the importance of preparation. Decisive preparation requires (a) whatever information may be necessary and (b) appropriate initiatives  based on that information. In their Introduction, the authors acknowledge a  number of rational and emotional \\"arguments\\" against the value of market  research. They then identify \\"The Dangerous Myths\\": I know these things.  Things never really change (so simply updating yesterday's plan will be  fine). The people with whom I talk all agree with me. The authors explain  why each of these myths is so dangerous. Myopia, ignorance, and arrogance  do indeed make a deadly combination.<br />It may be helpful if I now list the  ten chapter titles which correctly indicate the scope of the material  covered:<br />Why Market Research Matters<br />The Tools to Research the  Future<br />How to Implement Strategic Anticipation<br />Researching the Future  Brand<br />Researching the Future Customer Loyalty<br />Researching the Future  Competition<br />Researching the Future Channels<br />Researching the Future  Employee Loyalty<br />Researching the Future Internet<br />Is Your Market  Researcher Up to the Challenge?<br />Perhaps you agree with Sun Tzu about the  importance of thorough preparation.

The titles of  Dudik's chapters correctly indicate how thorough his coverage is. The notes  beneath each title are also revealing. For example, consider those for the  final chapter: \\"No matter what you've read elsewhere, there is no silver  bullet, there is no royal road to great strategic success. It's a matter of  inspiration, insight, falsification, and perspiration. Nevertheless, there  are crucial do's and don'ts that can maximize your chances of success.\\"  Dudik provides 81.<br />If your organization lacks \\"great strategic success\\"  and thus needs a rigorous yet creative process by which to achieve it, this  book will be invaluable. Here's one of several ways to derive the greatest  benefit from it. Have the key people in your organization (whatever its  size or nature) read this book. Schedule a one-day offsite meeting and base  the agenda on the sequence of 11 chapters. Have each participant come  prepared to correlate the key points made in each chapter with the  organization's current circumstances. Also, to discuss (specifically) what  must be done to achieve \\"great strategic success.\\" This book can not only  help set the agenda but also guide and inform discussion of subjects on  that agenda.

True, the decisions of a military leader may be described by others as \\"ruthless.\\" However, throughout The Art of War, Sun Tzu stresses the importance of doing everything possible to avoid battle before engaging in it only as a last resort, of winning a battle before it is fought, of capturing the hearts of those defeated, etc. In The Prince, the emphasis is on political expediency to sustain control, not on ruthlessness. That is, doing whatever it takes. If the necessary behavior is viewed by others as \\"ruthless\\", so be it. I also question if The Servant qualifies as a \\"classic\\" of strategy and power. If he were not its author, would McAlpine still have included it?<br />What we have here is a well-written Introduction, followed by the texts of The Prince, The Servant, and The Art of War. (This sequence makes no apparent sense.) Sun Tzu suggests what must be done to achieve military victory. Machiavelli suggests what a leader must be and do to achieve and then maintain absolute control. McAlpine suggests how a servant can be most helpful, hence most valuable to whomever served. (For McAlpine, that would be Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.) McAlpine is not an expert on either Sun Tzu or Machiavelli, nor does he claim to be. For him, the power of the Servant is determined by the nature and extent of influence on those who rule. I wish he had devoted at least some attention to such servants in the courts of He Lu (Prince of Wu) and the Medicis.<br />McAlpine asserts that each of the three texts can be useful \\"to the one working his or her way through any organization and to the person who could perhaps become prince.\\" Perhaps.  But if that is true, it is the reader who must determine the nature and extent of that usefulness...and do so without much assistance from McAlpin.  END	2000-05-13

Many of the selections are predictable: Michael Dell, Henry Ford,  Bill Gates, William Hewlett &amp; David Packard, Ray Kroc, Steve Jobs, Akio  Morita, Ted Turner, Sam Walton, and Thomas Watson Jr. What surprised and  pleased me is that Wawro also discusses several other \\"radicals &amp;  visionaries\\" which I did not expect to be included: Desi Arnaz &amp;  Lucille Ball, Clarence Birdseye, Gabrielle \\"Coco\\" Chanel, Berry Gordy, Hugh  Hefner, Jim Henson, John Johnson, George Lucas, David Ogilvy, Ron Popeil,  Martha Stewart, and Oprah Winfrey.<br />This book is great fun to read...as  well as informative. Wawro does indeed cover a wide as well as diverse  range of entrepreneurs who helped to revolutionize the 20th century. My  only complaint is the Wawro, who obviously completed a great deal of  research inorder to write this book, did not include an annotated  bibliography for readers who wish to learn more about the 70 subjects  discussed. Perhaps it was impractical to do so. This is nonetheless a  commendable achievement which I recommend highly.	2000-05-11

Benton is one of the most highly respected business \\"coaches.\\" In Chapter 1, she answers the  question \\"What Is Business Coaching?\\" The titles of the other seven  chapters suggest how she organizes the remaining material:<br />You Know  You're ready for Coaching When...<br />CEO Coaching Techniques You Can Apply  Yourself<br />Using Mental Energy: Attitude Management<br />Using Physical  Energy: Perception Management<br />Using Emotional Energy: It's What's Behind  What you're Saying that Speaks Loudest<br />Team Time: How to Coach  Others<br />Going All the Way: How to Hire a Coach<br />Following Chapter 8,  Benton provides an Appendix: Your Own Personal Playbook. To a certain  extent, the chapter titles could unintentionally mislead someone who is  thinking about reading this book. So please allow me to make some  reassurances. This book can be of substantial value even if (1) you have no  direct contact with a CEO, (2) you have no desire to become a CEO, and/or  (3) you have no desire to become a business coach...and especially if (4)  you or your organization cannot afford the cost of retaining business coach  for you.<br />It is important to keep in mind that the \\"secrets\\" which Benton  shares so generously are derived from her wide and deep experiences with  thousands of executives at all organizational levels. As the book's  subtitle correctly indicates, Benton offers to you \\"Your Personal Training  Guide to Thinking Like a Leader and Acting Like a CEO.\\" So many executives  commit hours and dollars to supervised physical fitness programs but invest  nothing in a program which will help them to become and then remain  \\"business fit.\\" Don't make that mistake.	2000-05-10

A \\"psychological \\"trigger\\" has three separate but related (and absolutely essential) functions: It can help to position an idea or object properly, it can suggest appropriate strategies to enhance the appeal of that idea or  object, and finally it can help to make the sale. The subtitle of this book  is essentially correct. Sugarman explains 30 sales tools which can control  the mind of a prospect through effective (and principled) use of  motivation, influence and persuasion. Each reader must determine for  herself or himself which of the \\"triggers\\" are most relevant and thus will  be most helpful.<br />Sugarman is a master wordsmith who has achieved great  success in direct marketing. You have no doubt seen various JS&amp;A ads.  He designed them and wrote the copy himself. Interestingly, the same  \\"triggers\\" he uses in those ads can also be used in personal sales  situations. Were I designing or revising a sales training program, I would  include the 30 \\"triggers\\" in the curriculum.<br />In Appendix B, Sugarman  offers \\"Recommended Reading\\" to which I presume to add Jacques Werth's High  Probability Selling and Neil Rackham's SPIN Selling. Sugarman would be the  first to point out that there is no one single best book on sales. I  suggest you check out the reviews (provided by Amazon.com) of all of his  recommendations (and mine), then make your selections and proceed  accordingly. I really appreciate Appendix D in which Sugarman provides a  concise and precise description of each \\"trigger\\" followed on the same page  by a worksheet, one for each \\":trigger.\\"<br />This book is both entertaining  and informative to read. It is also refreshing to learn that Trigger #30 is  Honesty, \\"one of the most powerful of all the psychological triggers.\\"  Sugarman insists (and I believe him) that he wants absolutely nothing to do  with anyone or anything that is fraudulent, cheesy, shoddy or deceptive.  How old fashioned! Sugarman really does believe that the best strategy to  achieve and then sustain business success is to have impeccable character,  a product or service of quality, and a sincere desire to serve.

In this book, he offers 24 \\"essential lessons\\" which he has learned from his extensive prior experience. Each of the \\"essential  lessons\\" makes sense but I think they have the greatest value only when  used together (in combination) as you formulate an investment plan. Once  you have your plan and begin to implement it, understand that your work has  only begun...not ended. Track earnings and sales, frequently check relative  price strength, follow chart patterns, etc. (O'Neil's Lesson 11 explains  \\"How to Read Stock Charts Like a Pro\\", not occasionally but \\"frequently\\"  and better yet daily.) No doubt sophisticated investors view this book as  \\"simplistic\\" and \\"obvious.\\" For them, it probably is. But for most of the  rest of us, this book provides helpful explanations and sound advice. Also,  as more people participate in 401 (k) plans and exercise stock options, a  book such as this can give them a better understanding of their  investments. I also recommend this book as a gift to recent graduates of  college and universities. The sooner they understand the vocabulary and the  concepts of stock investments, the better.	2000-05-09

These chapter  titles suggest some of the issues which are addressed:<br />*  Trouble-Spotting: Assessing the Likelihood of a Turnaround<br />*  Looming  Financial or Business Failure: Fix or File -- A Legal Perspective<br />*  Preparing for Bankruptcy: Building the War Chest<br />*  The Lawyer's Role in  Representing the Distressed Company<br />*  The Accountant's Role in the  Workout Environment<br />*  Dealing with Employee Issues in a Bankruptcy  Situation<br />*  Mergers and Acquisition Strategies for the Distressed  Company<br />At one time or another, all organizations experience serious  problems. Many of them eventually recover. The wealth of information and  advice provided in this single volume explains HOW. Other organizations,  unable to solve their problems, are either liquidated or acquired. This  book explains WHY. I know of no other single volume which offers more and  better information about workouts and turnarounds, corporate restructuring,  and bankruptcy proceedings. This book can be of substantial value to those  involved with a distressed organization. It was written primarily for them.  However, I think this book can also be of substantial value to those whose  organization is (at the moment) thriving and who are determined to sustain  that success. Knowing what NOT to do is often as important as knowing what  to do.	2000-05-09

Both Senge and Fritz insist that it is possible to design organizations to succeed.  That is to say, to design a structure which moves an organization \\"in the  directions [its] members seek.\\" Such movement is explained by three  scientific facts: energy moves along the path of least resistance, the  underlying structure of anything will determine its path of least  resistance, and it is possible to determine the path of least resistance by  creating new structures.<br />The implications of these three scientific facts  are even more important when we acknowledge that external forces and  circumstances can so quickly (and unexpectedly) require an organization to  change its direction. Competitors can substantially increase resistance  with an advertising blitz, initiating a price war, introducing a hot new  product, etc. Internal forces and circumstances (eg a workers' strike, loss  of key executives, litigation caused by defective products) can also  require an organization to change its direction.<br />It is insufficient  merely to design an appropriate structure. The organization must also make  certain that everyone involved understands that structure and, especially,  understands what is expected of them to ensure that structure's  effectiveness. In a \\"total learning organization\\", moreover, everyone  involved is prepared to help make whatever modifications may be  necessary.<br />Fritz does a brilliant job of explaining HOW to achieve all of  these objectives. The material is organized within a framework provided by  what he calls \\"The Nine Laws of Organizational Structure.\\" At the end of  each chapter, he includes a \\"Quick Review\\" of key points. If you share my  high regard for this book, I suggest that you also read his earlier work,  The Path of Least Resistance, as well as Senge's The Fifth Discipline and  The Dance of Change.Least Resistance, as well as Senge's The Fifth Discipline and  The Dance of Change.	2000-05-09

Boylan offers a cohesive and comprehensive system to overcome all manner of barriers. He calls it The Circle of Leverage and explains it within six different sections  entitled:<br />What's Been Keeping You Out<br />The Circle of Leverage System:  What It Is, What's Behind It, and How It Works<br />The Circle of of Leverage  System: The Ten Preparation Steps<br />Making Your Move: The Five Execution  Steps of the Circle of Leverage System<br />Advanced Moves<br />Mastering the  Circle of Leverage System<br />Obviously, this book can be very helpful to  those in sales but if we expand our perspective to include other forms of  persuasion, this book offers even greater value. For example, consider the  potential relevance of the Circle of  Leverage System to recruiting and  hiring, M&amp;A initiatives, competing with others in the same organization  for its resources, use of customers as an extended sales force, use of  \\"alumni\\" to locate talent, etc.<br />The Circle of Leverage System is sound.  Boylan's explanation of it is thorough and lucid. I recommend this book  highly to anyone who is both willing and able to make a sustained  commitment to applying these principles. What else will you need? Tenacity  and patience.	2000-05-09

As they explain, if you  create the appropriate physical and psychological environments for a group,  creative \\"sparks\\" can \\"fly\\"...perhaps igniting a department, a division or  even an entire organization. For whatever reasons, others do not share my  high regard for this book. So be it. What I expected -- and what it  delivers -- is a solid conceptual framework within which to generate and  then sustain collegial creativity. If you've read Robert Fritz's The Path  of Least Resistance for Managers, you are already aware of his assertion  that an organizational structure can be designed for success. Leonard and  Swap agree with Fritz, not only that such a design is possible but also  that it is imperative. Their book consists of six chapters:<br />What Is  Group Creativity?<br />Creative Abrasion<br />Generating Creative  Options<br />Converging on the Best Options<br />Designing the Physical  Environment<br />Designing the Psychological Environment<br />These chapters are  followed by several pages of Notes and a superb Bibliography. Their  concluding thoughts reiterate that &quot;creativity is a process -- and can  be encouraged and influenced....Thinking of creativity as a process  removes, we hope, some of the mystery -- and the temptation to step back  from the challenge....Creativity, like learning, is not only a process but  an attitude. An attitude that promotes creativity is a kind of alertness to  innovation opportunities -- a constant mental challenge to routine and  openness to change.... Some individuals thrive on the challenge of constant  change and improvement; others recoil from the implicit chaos....But it  takes only a small spark to ignite a large fire. Let the sparks!&quot;<br />I  provide this brief excerpt for two reasons. First, it gives you at least  some idea of how the authors think. Also and more importantly, their  remarks imply some of the barriers to \\"group creativity\\" which must be  overcome, if not eliminated: fears of being \\"wrong\\", of embarrassment, of  rejection, of seeming \\"dumb\\", etc. As Leonard and Swap correctly suggest,  it is as important to be alert to human sensitivities and vulnerabilities  it is to \\"innovation opportunities.\\" Without mutual respect, there can be  no mutual trust.

In it, Bernstein \\"tells the story of a group of thinkers whose remarkable vision revealed how to put the future at the service of the present. By showing the world how to understand risk, measure it, and weigh its consequences,, they converted  risk-taking into one of the prime categories that drives Western society.\\"  Bernstein organizes his material within an historical framework:<br />To 1200:  Beginnings<br />1200-1700:  A Thousand Outstanding Facts<br />1700-1900:  Measurement Unlimited<br />1900-1960:  Clouds of Vagueness and the Demand for  Precision<br />Degrees of Belief: Exploring Uncertainty<br />Bernstein examines  hundreds of situations throughout history in which human beings found  themselves against the gods and against the odds...some \\"winning\\" and  others \\"losing\\" but all somehow contributing to an understanding of what  risk is, of how it can be accurately measured, and of what the consequences  of a given risk could be. As Bernstein suggests, many of the most heroic  acts in history were undertaken without such understanding.<br />In the final  chapter, Bernstein reiterates his central theme: \\"the quantitative  achievements of the heroes we have met shaped trajectory of progress over  the past 450 years. In the beginning, medicine, science, finance, business,  and even in government, decisions that touch everyone's life are now made  in accordance with disciplined procedures that far outperform the  seat-of-the-pants methods of the past. Many catastrophic errors of judgment  are thus either avoided, or else their consequences are muted.\\" All of us  are the beneficiaries of those \\"quantitative achievements\\" and of this book  in which they are discussed with compelling eloquence.	2000-05-09

He invented the word \\"operacy\\" which he defines as \\"the skill of action....This book has very much to do with operacy.  The framework of the six action shoes is a help both in the training of action skills and also in the use of those skills at the moment of action.\\"<br />In Chapter Six, de bono introduces the \\"six action action shoes\\": Navy formal shoes, Grey sneakers, Brown brogues, Orange gunboots, Pink slippers, and Purple riding boots. The shoes colors are everyday colors \\"that suggest the nature of the action mode they indicate. The physical nature of the shoes also suggests the nature of the action made.\\"<br />What's all this about? De Bono uses the colors and styles of the six shoes as mechanisms by which to explain and then illustrate his concept of \\"operacy.\\" He asserts (and I agree) that quite specific skills are needed to take effective action. The nature of each action is obviously determined by what would be most appropriate in a given situation. For example, Navy formal shoes are needed when routines and procedures are involved whereas Pink slippers are needed in a situation which requires care, compassion,, and attention to human feelings and sensitivities.<br />This is a thoughtful and lucid book, as one would expect from Edward de Bono. If you find it to be as thought-provoking and practical as I have, you should also check out his Lateral Thinking and De Bono's Thinking Course as well as the works of Guy Claxton, Michael Michalko, Joey Reiman, and Roger von Oech.<br /> .	2000-05-08

As he explains in Chapter 6, &#34;The first value of the six thinking hats is that of defined  role-playing....[the second] is that of attention directing....[the third]  is that of convenience....[and the fourth] is the possible basis in brain  chemistry&#34; which de Bono outlines in the previous chapter.<br />What about  the hats? The conceit is brilliant. Each hat is of a different color:  white, red, black, yellow, green, and blue. De Bono assigns to each a quite  specific combination of qualities and characteristics. Since childhood, my  favorite color has always been green. Here is what de Bono says about it:  &#34;Green is grass, vegetation, and abundant., fertile growth. The green hat  indicates creativity and new ideas.&#34; De Bono also briefly characterizes the  other colors and then devotes an entire chapter to discussing each of them  in depth.<br />According to the subtitle, de Bono provides &#34;an essential  approach to business management.&#34; That is true. He helps his reader to  increase various reasoning skills through carefully defined and structured  role-playing, and, by directing and then focusing attention where it is  needed most. How? By understanding and then developing entirely different  perspectives which the various hats represent: White (neutral and  objective), Red (powerful emotions), Black (gloomy and negative), Yellow  (sunny and positive), Green (fertile and creative), and Blue (logical and  in control). You get the idea. De Bono urges his reader to SEE all of the  hats while associating with each its own defining qualities and  characteristics.<br /><br />Here's an exercise (inspired by Bono ideas) which will  work very well with those who have been required to read Six Thinking Hats  prior to getting together to brainstorm. Buy several of those delightful  Dr. Seuss hats (at least one of each of the six different colors, more if  needed) and keep the hats out of sight until everyone is seated. Review the  agenda. Review what de Bono says about what each color represents. Then  distribute the Dr. Seuss hats, making certain that someone is wearing a hat  of each color. Proceed with the discussion, chaired by a person wearing a  Blue or White hat. It is imperative that whoever wears a Black hat, for  example, be consistently negative and argumentative whereas whoever wears a  Yellow must be consistently positive and supportive. After about 15-20  minutes, have each person change to a different colored hat. Resume  discussion. Thanks to de Bono and (yes) to Dr. Seuss, you can expect to have an especially enjoyable as well as productive session.<br /><br />In addition  to de Bono's Six Action Shoes, there are other excellent books also worthy  of your consideration.

At least that's my suggestion. In Kick, first published in 1986, von Oech introduces four  stereotypes:<br />The Explorer<br />The Artist<br />The Judge<br />The Warrior<br />Von  Oech devotes a separate chapter to each. Also, he assigns to each quite  different values, priorities, mind sets, predispositions, and parameters  relative to creative thinking. This is a brilliant conceit. In varying  proportions, each of us is (simultaneously) an Explorer, an Artist, a  Judge, and a Warrior. Each plays an important role in the creative process.  Von Oech explains how and why.<br />As in A Whack on the Side of the Head, he  provides various exercises in combination with a rigorous analysis of each  of the four stereotypes. As is true of Whack, Kick will be immensely  valuable to executives in any organization which needs a culture within  which to generate and then nourish fresh ideas and new perspectives. The  same is true of all self-employed people (especially independent  consultants)  whose customers or clients expect them to address the same  need. Finally, I think that school, college, and university classroom  teachers can devise all manner of appropriate applications of von Oech's  ideas.<br />I strongly suggest that you buy both Whack and Kick. Also Roger  von Oech's Creative Whack Pack. Read and then re-read all three. Absorb and  digest the material. Let the ideas percolate for a while. (The material in  all three is remarkably cohesive...and intellectually combustible.) Then  try this experiment the next time you and others in your organization get  together to brainstorm. Whoever chairs the discussion is designated the  Judge. Depending on the size of the group, designate one or two others to  be (respectively) the Explorer, the Artist, and the Warrior. Require  everyone to think and comment ONLY within the strict limits of each  assigned role. After about 15-20 minutes of brainstorming, re-assign all  roles. Same requirement: each must think and comment only within the strict  limits of her or his role. No exceptions.(Once you read Kick, you'll know  exactly what I am suggesting...also why.) I'll bet you a beverage of your  choice that the results will surprise and delight everyone involved. Also,  and more to the point, it will prove to be the most productive brainstorm  session that anyone in the group had as yet participated in.

In this book, he shifts his attention to discussing \\"You and Your Job\\",  \\"You and Others\\", and \\"Your Career and Your Life.\\" Although very little in  this book could be described as \\"cutting edge thinking\\" on self-motivation,  Nelson has done a brilliant job of organizing the material from various  sources which he duly acknowledges.<br />Some assert that one of any leader's  major responsibilities is to inspire others. I agree. More specifically, to  inspire others to motivate themselves. I am convinced that only individuals  can motivate themselves. Nelson seems to agree: \\"This book is designed to  help inspire and lead you on your journey [ie to taking action to get  something done at work without waiting for your boss to tell you what to do  and how to do it]. In it you will find many real-life examples that can  encourage you to take charge, and practical tools and advice for helping  you better yourself and the place where you work.\\"<br />Who will derive the  greatest benefit from this book? I suggest two categories: Those who are  about to embark on a business career, and, those whose business career  (thus far) has been unfulfilling. Unless and until either reader assumes  full responsibility for making career decisions, and then assumes full  responsibility for the consequences of those decisions, no book will be of  much value. Pogo once said that \\"We have met the enemy and he is us.\\" Most  limits are self-inflicted. How easy it is to blame others when our efforts  prove inadequate. Nelson suggests a practical alternative: Self-initiative.  Easier said than done. How to do it? Read the book. Then take the  initiative to act upon those suggestions which are appropriate to your own  needs, interests, circumstances, and objectives in your work  environment.<br />Many of the same suggestions can also help you to take  appropriate initiatives in your personal life. For whatever reasons, others  do not rate this book as highly as I do. Fair enough. As indicated, I think  that Nelson has again written a thoughtful, lucid, and coherent book on a  subject of wide and deep relevance. Check it out. Judge its value for  yourself. Perhaps you will then share my high regard for Nelson's latest  contribution to our understanding of human potentiality.

By conceiving of  [that] environment in terms of eight figurative sectors, in which events  and trends are acting to shape the options open to the firm, we can  describe and think about at work there.\\"<br />During the 14 chapters which  comprise the book, Albrecht provides a cohesive and comprehensive  \\"framework for learning the lessons the business environment has to teach;  for getting useful insights into the structure and dynamics of a particular  business sector, and for integrating a wide range of discoveries, findings,  and conclusions into a unified tapestry.\\"<br />It is important to keep in mind  that, both literally and metaphorically, radar is merely a means by which  to recognize and perhaps measure certain objects. It does not have  unlimited capabilities. So-called \\"stealth technology\\" permits a number of  strategies and initiatives which can preclude detection by radar. All  organizations (regardless of size or nature) have information needs within  these \\"basic environments\\": Customer, Competitor, Economic, Technological,  Social, Political, Legal, and Geophysical. With timely and accurate  information, an organization can more effectively \\"track the forces\\" that  are shaping it.<br />Because change is the only constant, those forces are  certain to change; the nature and extent of information needed concerning  the \\"basic environments\\" will also change. Hence the importance of having a  system which can accommodate such change, preferably anticipating change  (eg paradigm shifts) but at least enabling a rapid response to it. Albrecht  explains his \\"model.\\" He then provides expert advice on how to devise a  system which is most appropriate to the information needs of a given  organization; finally, he includes step-by-step guidance during the  implementation of that system.<br />For executives within organizations in  need of such a system, this is a \\"must read.\\"ementation of that system.<br />For executives within organizations in  need of such a system, this is a \\"must read.\\"	2000-05-06

Just a suggestion. Von Oech  demonstrates in his thinking and in his writing the same principles he  advocates so eloquently. In Whack, first published in 1983, he identifies  ten \\"locks\\" which limit (if not preclude) creative thinking:<br /><br />The Right  Answer<br /><br />That's Not Logical<br /><br />Follow the Rules<br /><br />Be Practical<br /><br />Play Is  Frivolous<br /><br />That's Not My Area<br /><br />Avoid Ambiguity<br /><br />Don't Be Foolish<br /><br />To  Err Is Wrong<br /><br />I'm Not Creative<br /><br />How does each limit (if not preclude)  creative thinking? How can each be \\"unlocked\\"? To what extent are these  barriers interdependent? Von Oech devotes a separate chapter to each of the  ten, answering these and other questions while providing various exercises  in support of his explanations.<br /><br />Whack will be immensely valuable to  executives in any organization which needs a culture within which to  generate and then nourish fresh ideas and new perspectives. The same is  true of all self-employed people (especially independent consultants) whose customers or clients expect them to address the same need. Finally, I  think that school, college, and university classroom teachers can devise  all manner of appropriate applications of von Oech's ideas. When you listen to Richard Feyman's lectures on physics (now available on audio cassettes),  you suspect that he has read all of von Oech's books. He probably didn't.  Nonetheless, he and von Oech are kindred spirits.<br /><br />In addition to von Oech's A Kick in the Seat of the Pants, there are other excellent books also worthy of your consideration.

I am grateful for  the book now as I interact with my young grandsons. The authors suggest how  to protect \\"the emotional life of boys\\" and their counsel is invaluable.<br />Most parents are well-prepared to provide food, shelter, and clothing to  their children. Most grandparents do all they can to provide material  assistance to their sons and daughters who are parents. My guess (only a  guess) is that many parents and grandparents do not adequately understand a  child's psyche...especially that of a boy. Even if so inclined, who has the  time to read all the books and articles on the subject? Who knows which to  read?<br />Please understand that I do not consider myself qualified to  evaluate the expertise of this book's authors. I have no idea which other  books are also worthy of your consideration. But I can recommend this book  highly to those who have recurring contact with boys. They include parents  and grandparents, of course, but also other relatives, school  administrators, classroom teachers, coaches, members of the clergy, adult  leaders in organizations for boys (eg Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts), and  healthcare providers.<br />The book is well-written. The material is  effectively organized. The content is mercifully free of elaborate theories  and medical jargon. For those interested in this important subject (ie  &quot;protecting the emotional life of boys\\"), here is a single-volume  source of useful information and practical advice.	2000-05-04

As the subtitle indicates, Lewisexplains \\"how companies build mutual trust and win together.\\" It is imperative that individuals be worthy of trust. They must earn it and then sustain it with behavior based on core values. We all know that values derive from character (or the lack thereof), that values determine attitudes (both negative and positive), and that such attitudes are revealed by behavior.<br />My guess is that those in greatest need of this book will encounter the greatest difficulty when attempting to follow Lewis' suggestions. \\"Trust is at the heart of the knowledge economy....Rather than being a matter of blind faith, trust must be cone step at a time. Further, building trust between organizations is all-encompassing. It involves their people, politics, priorities, cultures, and structures.\\" Organizations become untrustworthy when those within those organizations are untrustworthy. Over the years, all of us have been victimized by fraudulent claims, intentional misrepresentations, corrupt \\"politics\\", \\"a hidden agenda\\", broken promises, etc. If trust is to be built between organizations, there must be interpersonal as well as intrapersonal relationships based on trustworthiness.<br />Lewis's book is divided into three parts: Trust Leads to High Performance, Alliances with Key Partner, and Tools for Trust: A Guide for Practitioners. He follows a step-by-step process within each part, providing an abundance of observations, suggestions, and caveats. Who will derive the greatest value from this book? Here are my nominees:<br />1. Decision-makers who have the authority (not simply the responsibility) for their organization's cultural transformation.<br />2. Owners/CEOs of start-ups who are committed to building trust as well as sales and profits.<br />3. Those involved in M&amp;A initiatives whose due diligence includes evaluation of cultural capital as well as material assets.<br />One of the book's most valuable sections (Chapter VII in the Third Part) summarizes \\"actions that establish trust-building habits.\\" Note the use of the word \\"habit.\\" Lewis is quite correct when insisting that time and effort are required to build and then sustain trust. Conversely, trust can be quickly compromised by a single act betrayal.<br />In this final section, the \\"trust-building habits\\" are classified as follows: Trust Conditions; Recruiting, Training, and Rewards; Management Behavior; and Other Activities. Once you have read the book, selected what is most appropriate to your own organization, and then begun the difficult task of implementation, it would be a good idea to re-read Chapter VII in the Third Part. The counsel Lewis provide will help you formulate your own tasks and objectives within the framework of the eight trust conditions and related practices.<br />If those within your organization are unwilling and/or unable to make a sincere and steadfast commitment to building and then sustaining trust, find another organization.

I don't think so...and neither does Lewis.	2000-05-04

Since it was first published, this book has become a &quot;must read&quot; for those  who are struggling to understand what is happening and, more to the point,  what will probably be happening in the global marketplace. Drucker has  suggested that one of the greatest challenges for any organization is to  manage the consequences and implications of a future which has already  occurred. I agree. However, I also agree with Barker that it is possible to  recognize what he calls a &quot;paradigm shift&quot;: a major change of the rules and  regulations that establish or define boundaries, a change which suggests  that new behavior will be required within those redefined boundaries.<br /><br />One  of the most important concepts in the book is what Barker calls &quot;paradigm  pliancy&quot;: &quot;the purposeful seeking out of new ways of doing things. It is an  active behavior in which you challenge your paradigms [ie the status quo,  assumptions and premises] by asking the Paradigm Shift Question: What do I  believe is impossible to do in my field, but if it could be done, would  fundamentally change my business?&quot; Have you asked this question? Do you  realize that one or more of your competitors may have already asked that  question?<br /><br />Although the book's subtitle is &quot;The Business of Discovering  the Future&quot;, the fact remains that (back to Drucker) the challenge is to  identity and then measure the degree of probability of various  contingencies...many of which may have already occurred or are now in  process.<br />Barker asserts that every organization must anticipate and then  innovate to achieve excellence in an age during which change is the only  constant. He suggests that there are five components to &quot;strategic  exploration&quot;: Understanding influences which shape our perceptions,  divergent thinking which enables us to consider more than &quot;one right  answer&quot;, convergent thinking which enables us to integrate data while  prioritizing choices, mapping which reveals pathways from the present to  the future, and finally, imaging which (with words or drawings or models)  documents what is learned during the process of exploration.<br /><br />This is a  business &quot;classic&quot; which will continue to be relevant so long as leaders of  organizations remain hostage to assumptions and premises which are either  already obsolete now or will soon become so.

In the Introduction, the authors provide a self-audit consisting of a series of direct questions. For example:<br />\\"Have you ever wondered why so many people in high positions seem to be selfish,  power-crazed boneheads?\\"<br />\\"Do you detest office politics?\\"<br />\\"Do  relationships at work remind you of a dysfunctional family?\\"<br />The balance  of the book focuses on strategies and tactics to help resolve (or at least  alleviate) the problems suggested by the various questions. The book is  divided into several different parts which focus on the nature of  cluelessness, organizational politics, improving relationships on the job,  \\"mapping the pecking order\\", \\"cracking the cultural code\\", understanding  change, and \\"choosing [an appropriate] life path.\\"  The book makes tons of  sense. The authors obviously care sincerely about the victims of  cluelessless. They offer what they call \\"both an atlas and a guide\\" for  coping with system dynamics, \\"the murky world of politics\\", \\"the emotional  world of people at work\\", \\"the red tape of bureaucracy\\", \\"the depths of  tribal life at work\\", and sudden/traumatic change. Finally, they examine \\"a  deeper  question that's a silent companion at work: What life path do you  really want to follow?\\"<br />Who should read this book? I highly recommend it  to those who feel that they are clueless and/or victims of those who are.  The authors offer excellent advice as to what to do (and what not to do),  how to do it, and when. I also recommend it highly to anyone in a senior  management position who has direct responsibility for developing others to  their full potential. Chances are that many (of not most) of those \\"others\\"  are clueless, not only in the workplace but also to the fact that this book  is available.	2000-05-03

Then I went back and re-read all of the classics it discusses. The core concept is intriguing: Re-visit the major works of various authors (from Homer to Hemingway) to uncover lessons in leadership. The authors found them in  abundance.<br />For example: The importance of understanding the dynamics of  teamwork (Agamemnon and Achilles); knowing the right questions to ask...and  the best way to ask them (Socrates); managing change while adapting to new  realities (Ajax); the complexities (and difficulties) of management  succession (King Lear); making unpleasant but necessary decisions  (Machiavelli); Simplify! Simplify! (Henry David Thoreau); and forging  consensus during a crisis (Hemingway's Robert Jordan). The authors also  examine the works of Plutarch, Pericles, Chaucer, Castiglione, Edmund  Burke, Charles Darwin, and Arthur Miller. Throughout this highly readable  book, the authors also examine a number of corporations which have either  applied various leadership lessons with great success or experienced  serious problems for failing to do so.<br />Who will derive the greatest  benefit from this book? I highly recommend it to those in positions of  leadership who appreciate world literature (albeit in translation) and are  constantly seeking different perspectives on the marketplace in which they  and their respective organizations compete. Also, to young executives whose  professional reading -- to date -- has been limited to various business  publications and (perhaps) to the latest \\"hot\\" business books. Finally, to  those recent college and university graduates with liberal arts degrees who  (erroneously) think that great world literature and the free enterprise  system are incompatible. On the contrary, as Clemens and Mayer suggest,  they are whole cloth...and many of their common threads are worthy of  thoughtful consideration.	2000-05-03

It is truly a masterpiece. By way of background, in 1960 (in its July-August issue), The Harvard Business Review published \\"Marketing Myopia\\" in which Levitt ties marketing \\"more closely  to the inner orbit of business policy.\\" Specifically, \\"Management must  think of itself not as producing products but as providing custom-creating  value satisfactions.\\" Companies should be marketing-led rather than  production-led. That will happen only if and when there is a total  commitment by senior management (and especially by the CEO) to satisfying  current customers so that they remain loyal, and, to attracting new  customers. Only marketing creates or increases demand. Without demand,  there are no customers.<br /><br />In the same article, Levitt makes an important  distinction: \\"Selling concerns itself with the tricks and techniques of  getting people to exchange their cash for your product. It is not concerned  with the values that the exchange is all about. And it does not, as  marketing invariably does, view the entire business process as consisting  of a tightly integrated effort to discover, create, arouse, and satisfy  customer needs.\\" Given this background, you can now place The Marketing  Imagination in a proper context. \\"Marketing Myopia\\" is reprinted within the  revised edition, first published in 1986.The chapter titles correctly  suggest the scope of the subjects Levitt discusses:<br /><br />1. Marketing and the  Corporate Purpose<br /><br />2. The Globalization of Markets<br /><br />3. The  Industrialization of Service<br /><br />4. Differentiation -- of Anything<br /><br />5.  Marketing Intangible Products and Product Intangibles<br /><br />6. Relationship  Management<br /><br />7. The Marketing Imagination<br /><br />8. Marketing Myopia<br /><br />9.  Exploit the Product Life Cycle<br /><br />10. Innovative Imitation<br /><br />11. Marketing  and Its Discontents<br /><br />I now ask you to re-read this list of chapter titles,  keeping in mind that Levitt's comments on each subject were formulated  15-20 years ago. That is, pre-WWW. That is, prior to the widespread  understanding and appreciation of positioning, paradigms and paradigm  shifts, \\"customized mass production,\\" Marketing Value Added (MVA) to create  Economic Value Added (EVA), brand equity, product and service  differentiation, etc.<br /><br />In essence, marketing means \\"getting and keeping  customers in some acceptable proportion relative to competitors.\\" That was true in 1986 when Levitt wrote those words and remains true now. However, even if Levitt and all the other major thought leaders  in marketing were to collaborate, their collective genius could not create demand for shoddy goods, nor overcome mediocre customer service. The corollary is also  true: neither product superiority nor operational excellence has compelling  value to customers unless and until \\"the marketing imagination\\" manages their perceptions of them.<br /><br />If you need to clarify your own thinking on key issues which include but are not limited to marketing, Levitt can  be of substantial assistance. Also, you will thoroughly enjoy the pleasure  of his company.Levitt's comments on each subject were formulated  15-20 years ago. That is, pre-WWW.

When the score is kept, there are winners and losers. Business is no different. The concept of open-book management has been around since some company owner in the distant past gathered employees and attempted to explain to them why it is so important to produce quality  work, on time and without waste. No doubt at least one of those employees  wondered \\"What's in it for me?\\" Good question.<br />With contributions by Bo  Burlingham, Stack wrote this book (first published in 1992) partly in  response to that question. He introduces \\"The Higher Laws of Business\\":<br />1. You get what you give.<br />2. Its easy to stop one guy, but it's pretty  hard to stop 100.<br />3. What goes around comes around.<br />4. You do what you  gotta do.<br />5. You gotta wanna.<br />6. You can sometimes fool the fans, but  you can never fool the players.<br />7. When you raise the bottom, the top  rises.<br />8. When people set their own targets, they usually hit them.<br />9.  If nobody pays attention, people stop caring.<br />10. As they say in  Missouri: Shit rolls downhill. By which we mean change begins at the  top.<br />To these Stack adds \\"The Ultimate Higher Law\\": When you appeal to  the highest level of thinking, you get the highest level of performance.  These are the eleven laws on which Stack's system of open-book management  is based. He explains each in thorough detail. Let's say that you agree  that these laws make sense, that they are relevant to your own  organization. Now what?<br />Pretend that you have entered \\"Stack's Open-Book  Management Store.\\" He greets you at the door. For the next several hours,  he guides you through an abundance of strategies, tactics, measurement  instruments, communication devices, policies, procedures, etc. He answers  all of your questions. He offers a number of caveats. He shares his own  successes and failures. He directs you to the latest \\"newer and better\\" but  also to \\"what still works really well.\\" At the end of your visit, you are  fully prepared to pick and choose from among all the options. Then he  assists you with formulation of a plan to design and then implement your  own open-book management program, one which is specifically appropriate to  the needs of your own organization.  In effect, this what happens as you  read the book. I recommend it highly. Even if an open-book management  program is not what your organization currently needs, the issues Stack  addresses and the questions he raises are still worthy of your thoughtful  consideration.nd of your visit, you are  fully prepared to pick and choose from among all the options.

Here in a single volume, in the English language, is a definitive introduction to the origins of contemporary culture. The reader is provided with a wealth of information but also with  a wealth of illustrations...all of which, explained by Onians with  compelling eloquence,  but also answers to questions such as \\"What are the  foundations of western civilization?\\" and \\"What is the human fabric of  those foundations?\\" The material is organized as follows:<br />Chapter One  The Culture of the Greek Workshop<br />Chapter Two Greek Art and the  Culture of Conflict<br />Chapter Three Greek Art and the Culture of  Competition<br />Chapter Four Hellenistic Art and the Culture of  Character<br />Chapter Five Roman Art and the Culture of Memory<br />Chapter  Six  Rome and the Culture of Imagination<br />Chapter Seven The  Culture of the Christian Church<br />According to Onians, \\"The power of Greek  art over Rome, and then of Greek and Roman art over later generations,  resided less in the multiplicity or complexity of that art than in its  embodiment of a limited number of traits, traits such as the hardness,  mathematical regularity, lifelikeness, uniformity, physical energy and  emotional expressiveness of Greek art, or the memorability, monumentality,  personality, material and formal richness, flexibility and simplicity of  that of Rome.\\" What Onians has accomplished is nothing less than a cohesive  and comprehensive analysis of Classical art and of the cultures of ancient  Greece and Rome.<br />Some (very few) books serve as a \\"magic carpet\\" which  transports their reader to ancient experiences which would otherwise be  inaccessible. This one of those books. Remarkably, without in any way  compromising his scholarly standards, Onians functions as a congenial as  well as knowledgeable companion. His seems to be an intimate as well as  thoroughly familiar with everything and everyone he discusses.	2000-05-02

Chasm \\"is unabashedly aboutand for marketing within high-tech enterprises.\\" It was written forthe entire high tech community \\"to open up the marketing decision making during this [crossing] period so that everyone on the management team can participate in the marketing process.\\" In Chasm, Moore isolates and then corrects what he describes as a \\"fundamental flaw in the prevailing high-tech marketing model\\": the notion that rapid mainstream growth could follow continuously on the heels of early market success. <br />In his subsequent book, Inside the Tornado, Moore's use of the \\"tornado\\" metaphor correctly suggests that turbulence of unprecedented magnitude has occurred within the global marketplace which the WWW and the Internet have created. Moreover, such turbulence is certain to intensify. Which companies will survive? Why? I have only one (minor) quarrel with the way these two books have been promoted. True, they provide great insights into marketing within the high technology industry. However, in my opinion, all e-commerce (and especially B2B) will be centrally involved in that industry. Moreover, the marketing strategies suggested are relevant to virtually (no pun intended) any organization -- regardless of size or nature -- which seeks to create or increase demand for what it sells...whatever that may be. I consider both books &quot;must reading.&quot;	2000-05-02

The minding organization behaves  like a living organism, in which adapting is central to vitality and  control.\\" Agreeing with Drucker that organizations must manage the  implications and consequences of a future that has already occurred, the  authors suggest a number of strategies which will \\"bring the future to the  present and turn creative ideas into business solutions.\\" Their book is  organized as follows:<br />Chapter One: The Minding Organization<br />Chapter  Two: Transforming the Organization into an Organism<br />Chapter Three:  Adapting and Planning<br />Chapter Four: Structure, Creativity, and Error: The  Foundations of the Minding Organization<br />Chapter Five: Chaos to Order to  Chaos: Embracing Uncertainty<br />Chapter Six: Expanding the Imagination:  Frames as Filters<br />Chapter Seven: Kniht [Think] Backward: Visit the Future  in the Present<br />Chapter Eight: The New Leadership: Operating on the Edge  of Chaos<br />Chapter Nine: The Minding Organization in Action<br />The authors  provide a rigorous analysis of each component of a process by which to  \\"bring the future to the present and turn creative ideas into business  solutions.\\" At the conclusion of Chapter Six, they suggest that the minding  organization \\"creates chaos deliberately up front by starting with  divergent concurrent perceptions and encourages errors to surface early  when the costs of detection and correction are minimal.\\" Immediately in the  next chapter, they explain that the \\"frames\\" we create \\"filter the world  for us, allowing us to manage the tremendous amount of information  available.\\" They then examine various \\"filters\\" which could prevent us from  formulating the aforementioned \\"divergent concurrent perceptions.\\" The  sequence of the authors' ideas thus flows logically from one chapter to the  next.<br />In the final chapter, the authors identify thirteen \\"precepts\\" of  the minding organization. By now they have explained the interrelationships  between (indeed the interdependence of) these precepts; they have also  provided a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective plan by which to  apply those precepts to the needs of any organization, regardless of its  size or nature.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged  to read two books written by Peter Senge, The Fifth Discipline and The  Dance of Change. Rubinstein, Firstenberg, and Senge no doubt agree with  Derek Bok's observation, when criticized by parents of Harvard students  after a tuition increase: \\"If you think education is expensive, try  ignorance.\\" In the minding organization, education is alive and well...and  given its relative cost, a bargain.sequence of the authors' ideas thus flows logically from one chapter to the  next.<br />In the final chapter, the authors identify thirteen \\"precepts\\" of  the minding organization.

The First (1730-1820) is  manifest in the American Revolution. Fogel observes: \\"Steeped in the  rationalism of the Enlightenment, and harboring suspicions of the  established churches, the leaders of the Revolution tended to view all  political issues through the prism of natural rights rather than divine  revelation.\\"<br />As Fogel explains, the leaders of the The Second (roughly  1800 until 1870) \\"preached that the American mission was to build God's  kingdom on earth....An array of reform movements [eg temperance, abolition  of slavery, elimination of graft in government] sought to make America a  fit place for the Second Coming of Christ.\\" The Third (from about 1890  until the 1930s)  involved a continuation of certain reforms as well as the  introduction of others led by modernists and Social Gospelers who \\"laid the  basis for the welfare state, providing both the ideological foundation and  the politic drive for the labor reforms of the 1930, 1940s and 1950s, and  for the civil rights reforms of the 1950 and 1960s, and for the new  feminist reforms of the late 1960s and early 1970s.\\"<br />In Fogel's view,  the Fourth Great Awakening now underway has resulted in attacks on material  corruption, the rise of pro-life and pro-family movements, campaigns for  values-oriented school curricula, an expansion of tax revolt, and an attack  on entitlements. Fogel observes: All of the Great Awakenings are \\"not  merely, nor primarily, religious phenomena. They are primarily political  phenomena in which the evangelical churches represent the leading edge of  an ideological and political response to accumulated technological,  economic, and social changes that undermined the received culture.\\"<br />As  stated previously, Fogel's purpose is to provide \\"a framework for analyzing  the movements that shaped the egalitarian creed in America.\\"  In process,  he places the Fourth Great Awakening within an historical  frame-of-reference. Here is the sequence of subjects  analyzed:<br />Introduction: The Egalitarian Creed in America<br />One: The  Fourth Great Awakening, the Political Realignment of the 1990s, and the  Potential for Egalitarian Reform<br />Two: Technological Change, Cultural  Transformations, and Political Crises<br />Three: The Triumph of the Modern  Egalitarian Ethic<br />Four: The Egalitarian Revolution of the Twentieth  Century<br />Five: The Emergence of a Postmodern Egalitarian  Agenda<br />Afterword: Whither Goes Our World?<br />When concluding his analysis,  Fogel suggests that the spiritual struggles for those in future generations  will be \\"more complex and more intense than those of my generation.\\"  Nonetheless, Fogel hopes they will possess \\"a maturity and intellectual  vitality that will help [them] find better solutions than we have found.\\"  Meanwhile, in 2000, will anyone deny that our society has urgent spiritual  needs, secular as well as sacred? I agree with Fogel that \\"Spiritual (or  immaterial) inequity is now as great a problem as material inequity,  perhaps even greater.&quot; Rather than defer that problem to our  grandchildren, we have a moral imperative to solve or at least alleviate  that problem. To do so, we must first understand the nature and extent of  its complexity.

All are first-rate and well-worth checking out. In this book, Crainer devotes a separate chapter to each of the 20th century's ten decades, concluding each chapter with a timeline. In  the final chapter, he provides an insightful analysis of \\"The State of  Management.\\"<br />In his Preface, Crainer observes that \\"the historical and  theoretical strands that go to make up management are many and varied. The  great management thinkers are drawn from a bewildering variety of  disciplines and professions.\\" He then explains that his book \\"aims to  gather together many of these gloriously varied strands and provide a  concise and insightful guide to the major developments in thinking and  practice during the twentieth century.\\" Here in the proverbial \\"nutshell\\"  is what this book is all about. Given the wealth of rock-solid content  contained within a single-volume, presented with a crisp writing style,  Crainer's is indeed a brilliant achievement. Here are the ten periods and  some of the &quot;great management thinkers and practicioners&quot;  discussed in each:<br />1900-1910: Stopwatch Science [eg Elihu Root, Henri  Fayol, and Frederick Winslow Taylor]<br />1911-1920: Modern Times [eg Henry  Ford, Frank &amp; Lilian Gilbreth]<br />1921-1930: Discovering the  Organization [eg Max Weber, Chester Barnard, Billy Durant, and Alfred  Pritchard Sloan Jr.]<br />NOTE: Throughout the book, Crainer inserts his  comments. For example: \\"Taylor discovered work. Ford discovered work on a  massive scale. Sloan organized work.

Books	5	28	29	N	N	Keep the Faith...and Prosper	Daily (or so it seems to me) there are 10-15 new books published which offer to help their readers get RICH (quickly or eventually) during these \\"turbulent times\\" of \\"unprecedented opportunities.\\" Because of his well-deserved prominence, whenever Ken Blanchard publishes a new book, it  receives special attention. He knows this. I suspect, therefore, that he  feels special pressure to provide in each new book solid content which is  carefully organized and well-written, content which has real value.<br />He  and co-author Sheldon Bowles succeed brilliantly in the third \\"leg\\" of  their trilogy in which they describe \\"the three key factors that determine  the long-term success of an organization: as a provider of choice (Raving  Fans), as an employer of choice (Gung Ho!), and [now] as an investment of  choice (Big Bucks).\\"<br />The \\"story\\" they tell is of a fellow named Len whose  quest is to learn the secrets to moneymaking. Like Bunyan's Pilgrim, Len  encounters many adventures during his quest, accompanied by the reader. We  are introduced to Rabbi Silver, Father Murphy, Pastor Edwards, and  moneymakers from their respective congregations. At first, this seemed odd  to me. What are Blanchard and Bowles up to? Why include clergy? What is the  connection to accumulating \\"Big Bucks?\\" Yes, yes, of course. Regardless of  their denomination, all congregations heavily depend upon financial support  to sustain their good work. But isn't this book supposed to provide  \\"guidelines to becoming a multimillionaire?\\" What about making \\"serious  money\\" for both me and my company?<br />It would be a great disservice both to  the authors and to the book's readers were I to reveal the aforementioned  \\"three key factors\\" or to explain the relevance of the clergy and several  of their congregants to the reader's own \\"quest\\" to learn the secrets of  moneymaking. Read the book. Then re-read it. Judge for yourself.<br />Recall  my previous reference to the daily appearance of books about wealth  creation. I rate Big Bucks so highly on its own merits but also admire it  for another reason which the authors may not have had in mind when they  wrote this book: This would make an  excellent gift for recent graduates of  schools, colleges, and universities. Why? Because, as they embark on their  own journey in search of economic health (if not wealth), this little book  will help anchor them in some profoundly important values: commitment,  intensity, purpose, and even fun.<br />One final Point: Big Bucks also  provides a conceptual frame-of-reference within which to evaluate other  books on wealth accumulation. For that reason alone, it is a \\"must read.\\"wealth  creation.

What is to me remarkable is that it\\"holds up\\" so well over time. Obviously, as the reprintingsindicate, it has been immensely helpful to salespersons as well as to those who train them and to those who supervise them.<br />With the recent and accelerated development of online merchandising, however, I wondered, \\"Has the SPIN System lost any relevance?\\" So I re-read the book again. My answer is \\"Yes\\" and \\"No.\\"<br />\\"Yes\\" in that online merchandising relies so heavily (almost exclusively) on technology to provide information and then to process orders. By the time most prospective buyers visit a website, they have already examined their situation (S), identified a problem (P), considered the implications of that problem (I), and determined the desired need-payoff (N). However, the core principles of SPIN Selling are nonetheless invaluable to those who design the systems by which to expedite online merchandising. For example, the principles can assist with the formulation of feedback mechanisms which enable the prospective buyer to sharpen the focus on her or his specific Situation, Problem, Implication, and Need-payoff. The reality is that \\"customized\\" commodities are still commodities, of course, but a buyer's perception of them may be otherwise.<br />But \\"No\\" in that so many so-called \\"Big Ticket\\" purchases necessarily involve a salesperson. Moreover, there is usually a direct correlation between the amount of the purchase and the length of the sales cycle. In addition, many of these purchases also involve a \\"circle of influence\\" which complicates the situation even more. Use of the SPIN System, therefore, must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate a sometimes wide variety of different (perhaps contradictory) perspectives on the given Situation, Problem, Implication, and Need-payoff. My own rather extensive experience suggests that it is and it does.<br />The latest re-reading also suggested to me, in ways and to an extent previous readings hadn't, that the principles of SPIN Selling (with only minor modifications) can be effectively applied to situations in which nothing is for sale. For example, during the hiring process, when a promotion is being negotiated, or after a major crisis has occurred and must be resolved. Yes, yes, I know. There are excellent reasons why Rackham's book bears the title it does. The title is certainly appropriate. All I presume to suggest is that, for me at least, the principles of SPIN Selling have applications wholly unrelated to the selling process...unless we extend the meaning of \\"selling\\" to include persuasion in almost any context.<br />This is a business \\"classic.\\" Like all other such classics, it deserves to be re-read periodically, both to remind us of what we may have forgotten and to reveal to us what we may have failed to understand before. Within a turbulent global marketplace, moreover, the principles of SPIN Selling have achieved a matrix of relevancies which perhaps even Rackham could not have anticipated in 1988.reading also suggested to me, in ways and to an extent previous readings hadn't, that the principles of SPIN Selling (with only minor modifications) can be effectively applied to situations in which nothing is for sale.

When the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote were introduced by Chuck Jones in 1949, the global marketplace was certainly quite different from what it is today. For example, the economies of countries such as Germany and Japan had only begun to recover from World War II. The U.S.S.R. was solidly  intact behind what Winston Churchill described as an \\"Iron Curtain.\\" About  that time, Thomas Watson, Sr. insisted that the entire worldwide market for  computers was (at the most) seven. (According to some accounts, the  estimate was five.) More than 40 years would pass before the WWW would be  established. That was then. Chip R. Bell and Oren Harari suggest that we  now compete in The Age of the Road Runner. As in Jones's animated cartoons,  Road Runners win and Coyotes lose. Why? That is one question which the  authors answer in BEEP! BEEP! Unlike real coyotes, Wile E. Coyote's human  counterparts can become a Road Runner. How? That is another question which  the authors also answer.  Don't be deterred by the title. (I was. I  feared this was another gimmicky business book with a snappy title and  anorexic content. I was wrong.) On the dust jacket, Michael Dell is quoted  as saying that this book is \\"very powerful and entertaining.\\" That's true.  Bell and Harari juxtapose two antagonists which serve as metaphors  throughout a rigorous but delightful examination of the reasons for both  success and failure in the global marketplace.<br />The authors offer some  truly valuable insights into serious matters such as leadership,  \\"competing in the terrain of the future\\", collaborative \\"flocking\\" (as  opposed to mindless regimentation), strategic uses of speed, flexibility  and adaptability, the power of honorable cultures, the \\"magic\\" of curiosity  and innovation, and the importance of joy (as opposed to pleasure). I  especially appreciate the inclusion of several dozen boxed items (eg  \\"Birdseed\\") which supplement (indeed nourish) the narrative.<br />Near the  end of the book, the authors briefly discuss Alan Shafer, Group Vice  President of Cincinnati-based Milacron's Industrial Products division. The  subject is Shafer's business philosophy which boils down to three premises:  \\"First, push the envelope.\\" (Harvey Mackay would certainly agree.) \\"Next,  share the credit....Finally, have fun doing it.\\" We all know about  fun-loving cultures such as those of Milacron and Southwest Airlines. So  many other companies incorrectly assume that it is impossible for them to  have such a culture. According to Shafer, \\"Fun is how you keep your road  runners motivated....Fun is how you turn your coyotes into roadrunners.\\"  Bell and Harari provide a road map and an operations manual.<br />They fully  understand how difficult it can be for an organization to turn its coyotes  into road runners. The point is, that all organizations CAN. Here is a  brief excerpt in which the authors comment on speed: \\"The key to the Road  Runner's success is that he's more than just fast. He's unpredictable, he  zigs and zags, he reacts creatively real-time. In a world where linear  speed is a commodity, any organization can use technologies that compress  time....The key to thriving is no longer just the ability to work fast, but  what [italics] you are able to do fast.\\"<br />Here's one initiative I strongly  recommend: purchase a book which discusses key business issues with both  wit and wisdom, then apply what you have learned.

Of course, Ben Franklin played a major  role then and remains one of the most highly regarded of our nation's  \\"founding fathers.\\" When I first obtained a copy of McCormick's book, I was  immediately suspicious. I consider Franklin's Autobiography a masterpiece  and feared that McCormick would simply \\"package\\" some of Franklin's best  ideas after marinating them in contemporary business jargon, make a quick  buck or two, and then move on another writing project (eg Secrets of  Paleolithic Leadership).<br />In fact,  this is a solid book. McCormick wrote  it for \\"current and future managers, supervisors and small business owners\\"  but I think it has value for managers within ALL organizations, non-profit  as well as for-profit, regardless of size or nature. The scope, depth, and  clarity of Franklin's ideas continue to have wide and deep relevance.<br />A  very informative Introduction is followed by 12 chapters (one per \\"Rule\\").  At the conclusion of each chapter, there is a checklist of activities.  Throughout the book, Franklin is quoted extensively but McCormick does not  (to his credit) depend on the Franklin quotations to \\"carry\\" the narrative.  On the contrary, McCormick's all-important role is to correlate Franklin's  \\"Rules\\" with the contemporary business world and he does so with  considerable skill. So, I was surprised and pleased as I read this book.<br />A few final points. In the Conclusion, McCormick expresses the hope that  his book will help its reader to become a better \\"businessperson.\\" With all  due respect to the most advanced technologies today, they will never  replace the need for human beings. Franklin knew the limits of technology  as he observed the development of the Industrial Revolution in his own  time. There will always be a need for human beings in business...but what  kind of people? McCormick's book helps us to recognize and appreciate the  relevance of Franklin's ideas to modern management. I share his hope that  Franklin's ideas can also nourish the humanity of those who manage.t  kind of people?

This seems to be Fish's attitude toward \\"principle.\\" He is not opposed to it, per se.  Rather, he opposes what he views to be abuses of \\"principle\\" when invoked  to validate a given position, especially one to which he is opposed. In the  Prologue, he observes that \\"bad things are now being done in the name of  neutral principles, and I hope it is clear by now that it is no paradox to  say that bad things are being done by something that doesn't exist.\\" For  Fish, a \\"neutral principle\\" is one favored by liberal theorists whose claim  is that \\"abstractions like fairness, impartiality, mutual respect, and  reasonableness can be defined in ways not hostage to any partisan agenda.\\"<br />The argument of his book, therefore, is that political realism \\"can be a  resource for politics, not for politics in the rarefied sense named by  chimeras like fairness and mutual respect but for politics as it has always  been practiced, and practiced honorably, in the wards and boroughs of  ancient Rome, seventeenth-century London, and twentieth-century  Chicago.\\"<br />The first section of his book sets out the aforementioned  \\"argument\\" against neutral principle and for politics. The second section  focuses on the \\"arena\\" of First Amendment jurisprudence within which  neutral principles are most active. In the third section, Fish concentrates  on the religion clause of the First Amendment, explaining why \\" the dream  of liberal neutrality\\" encounters so many difficulties when subjected to a  discourse \\"that refuses to be confined within the precincts of the  private.\\" In the fourth and final section, Fish shares a number of \\"general  speculations\\" and then a few of his personal beliefs. The title of the  Epilogue (\\"How the Right Hijacked the Magic Words\\") correctly indicates  Fish's concern that liberals and progressives have lost control of \\"the  vocabulary of America's civil religion\\" to their traditional opponents, the  conservatives. According to Fish, this is a lamentable but undeniable  political reality.<br />I was curious to know what others have said about  this book. Although I have not read all of the reviews, those I have read  seem to fall within two predictable categories: readers who share Fish's  concerns and convictions praise the book; those who do not tend to dismiss  it as misguided polemics. Why do I rate it so highly? There are three basic  reasons. First, it is very well written. Second, the power of Fish's  assertions has forced me to re-examine my own convictions (eg about \\"the  vocabulary of civil religion\\" and the larger issue of how any terms are  defined). Third, Fish has directed me to a number of other books and  articles which were previously unknown to me. He thus helps to broaden and  deepen my frame-of-reference. I am eager to explore all of these  sources.<br />Dante reserved the seventh (and worst) ring in Hell for those  who, in a moral crisis, maintained their neutrality. Perhaps this is what  Fish had in mind when he observes (in the Prologue): \\"Taking sides, weapon  in hand, is not a sign of zealotry or partisanship; it is the sign of  morality; and it is the morality of taking sides, of frank and vigorous  political action, that is celebrated (not urged; it is inevitable) in the  pages that follow.\\" Fish need have no fear of that seventh ring.y of America's civil religion\\" to their traditional opponents, the  conservatives.

The authors do indeed provide strategies for effectively \\"aligning customer relationships, market strategies, and business structures.\\"  They make a key distinction between encounters with  customers and relationships with customers. As Jeffrey Gitomer and others  have already observed, \\"customer satisfaction\\" is measured in terms of each  transaction whereas \\"customer loyalty\\" depends upon a relationship of  repeated transactions. Gutek and Welsh obviousy agree. In the Preface, they  assert that \\"This vital -- and misunderstood -- distinction between the two  fundamental ways to deliver service is the catalyst to structuring the  business for maximum success.\\" Their excellent book is then divided into  ten chapters which guide the reader through a step-by-step process.<br />For  example, Chapter One \\"looks at customer perceptions of some common  practices that result from mistaken ideas about what constitutes a  relationship.\\" Chapter Five identifies several different types of encounter  and then examines one specific kind: \\"when the individual service provider  is replaced by a machine.\\" In Chapter Ten, the final chapter, the authors  bring the reader back to the central question (ie What are the basic causes  of customer dissatisfaction and how can they be avoided or eliminated?),  then discuss \\"the trends that will be important for success in the years  beyond 2000.\\"<br />As technological connectivity rapidly and extensively  replaces so much of direct human interaction, it is imperative to  understand the differences (as well as the implications of those  differences) between an encounter with a customer and a relationship with a  customer. Gutek and Welsh have made an invaluable contribution to our  understanding of those differences...and to our understanding of how to  achieve and then sustain enhanced relationships with those whom we are  privileged to serve.	2000-04-22

Christine Harvey (based in London) selected and then interviewed 10 salespersons based throughout the world  (USA, UK, Singapore, Australia, Belgium, Germany, and Sweden). At the time  of the interviews, all were \\"top performers\\" who shared with Harvey the  \\"secrets\\" of their success. The industries represented: Financial Futures,  Automotive (2), Insurance, Manufacturing, Travel, Broadcasting Equipment,  Cleaning Equipment, Processed Control Systems, and Food.<br />Were I to list  the \\"secrets\\", you would probably respond \\"Well, duh.\\" Hence the importance  of your reading and then re-reading the book, allowing the \\"secrets\\" to  emerge within the context of various conversations. Harvey skillfully  describes the unique style of each of the \\"top performers\\" who seem to have  almost nothing in common except extraordinary success in sales.<br />There  are so many excellent books on sales. Those written by Werth, Gitomer,  Rackham, Gerard, and Ziglar are among the ones I rate highest and include  Harvey's book also. You will derive the greatest value from hers by  cherry-picking the best suggestions which are provided in an Action Section  at the end of each chapter. Also, pay close attention to how the  personality of each \\"top performer\\" is revealed during her or his  conversation with Harvey. These are people whom we immediately respect,  whom we trust, and with whom we feel comfortable. For them, closing a sale  is the almost inevitable result of authentic rapport which they so  carefully establish. Read the book and learn how you can have the same  impact on others... and hopefully become a &quot;top sales performer&quot;  also.	2000-04-22

Frankly, I couldn't care less. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it,  learned a great deal from it, and now plan to read or re-read other books  on the same (general) subject. Given the popularity of two recent films,  Elizabeth and Shakespeare in Love, I must assume that there are many other  readers who would also appreciate having an especially well-informed,  charming, and energetic companion during a journey back in time to  Elizabethan England. Yes, this is a biography of Shakespeare...but more,  much more.<br />Following a List of Illustrations (which are excellent), an  Introduction, and A Note on Conventions Used in the Text, Honan divides his  book into for parts:<br />I. A Stratford Youth<br />II. Actor and Poet of  the London Stage<br />III. The Maturity of Genius<br />IV. The Last  Phase<br />At this point in my brief commentary, I want to stress that Honan's  writing style is semi-formal but reader-friendly. His prose shares many of  the same strengths evident in the works of other authors such as Alistair  Cooke, E.B. White, and Charles Kuralt.<br />The world in which Shakespeare  lived and worked was one of the most interesting throughout human history.  Honan includes a wealth of social, political, and cultural information  about that age in combination with anecdotes, gossip, speculations and  conjectures, correlation's between Shakespeare's works and the details in  his life, etc. What were Shakespeare's probable circumstances during his  childhood and youth in Stratford? What was it like to live in London,  especially when that walled city was ravaged by plague? Who attended live  performances? When? Where? How were those performances financed? Who was  Shakespeare's competitors for recognition and reward? Why did Shakespeare  eventually retire to Stratford? What are the probable circumstances of the  years there prior to his death in 1616? (Cervantes died on the same day in  the same year.) Honan suggests answers to these and hundreds of other  questions you may also have about Shakespeare and his age.<br />Is this the  best biography of Shakespeare written thus far? I am unqualified to  respond. Is this one of the most entertaining and most informative books I  have read about a major figure in the history of western civilization? You  bet. It does not \\"read like a novel\\" nor was it intended to. If you desire  an \\"easy\\" read on this subject, try another source (eg Shakespeare for  Dummies, Chicken Soup for Elizabethans).

In the Foreword, Ken Blanchard  correctly points out that \\"Stories are powerful...Stories stick with  people.\\" He also thinks that the story told in this book is priceless.\\"  Perhaps. Presumably he is referring to the fable. Certainly not to Part Two  which seems to suffer from the same lack of resources which the penguins  encounter in Part One.<br />Here's what I suggest. First, buy the book and  read it cover to cover. Then re-read Part One. Next, formulate your own  check-list of correlations between the fable's narrative (in Part One) and  your own organization. All organizations have core values. What are yours?  All organizations function in terms of certain basic premises and  assumptions. What are yours? Is there stereotyping in your organization? If  so (probably so), what are the pigeon holes to which customers as well as  employees are assigned? Take a look in the proverbial \\"mirror\\" and ask  yourself: What are my own core values? What are my own basic assumptions  and premises about myself? About the people I associate with?<br />You may not  be pleased by the all of the answers (if they are honest answers) but they  will certainly help you to reduce (if not eliminate) stereotyping from your  perspectives on yourself as well as on others. Also, you will be better  prepared to recognize -- and cope with -- others' stereotyping. Once you  complete this process, re-read Part Two. Then review and fine-tune your  conclusions with the authors' assistance.<br />One word of caution about  those conclusions: Over time, they could become assumptions and premises  which encourage (or at least permit) some more stereotyping. You're not  living in the Land of Penguins but there are lessons to be learned from it.  As I think Hateley and Schmidt would concur, the ultimate value of those  lessons will be determined by what you learn from them...and then what you  do as a result of what you have learned.those conclusions: Over time, they could become assumptions and premises  which encourage (or at least permit) some more stereotyping.

The material is organized as follows:<br />Part I: Winning the  Economic Case for E-Commerce (eg How to Avoid Low-Payoff E-Commerce  Applications)<br />Part II: Managing the Transition to E-Commerce (eg  Principles of Managing E-Commerce-Induced Change)<br />Part III: Building the  E-Commerce Infrastructure (eg Principles of Successful E-Commerce  Management)<br />Throughout the book, Cohan includes a number of \\"Case  Lessons\\" derived from corporate initiatives which include those of Cisco  Connection Online, the Ames Research Center, Charles Schwab, W.W. Grainger,  Chase Manhattan, Microsoft E-Procurement, Merrill Lynch, HP Inkjet  Printers, Weyerhaeuser, Eastman Chemical, eBay, Horizon Healthcare, Allied  Signal, and American International Group (AIG).  I rate this book so  highly for three main reasons: It is especially well-organized; most of the  content (to the best of my knowledge) has not as yet been provided  elsewhere in a single source; and finally, Cohan's brilliant analysis of  the material enables virtually any organization (regardless of its size or  nature) to avoid or overcome the aforementioned \\"blocks\\" that inhibit the  progress of e-commerce.<br />All of his advice seems to be anchored in a  wealth of real-world experience. Better yet, each of the many clusters of  specific recommendations is provided within a  directly relevant  frame-of-reference. For example, in the final chapter, \\"Managing the  Implementation\\", Cohan prepares his reader for an immensely difficult  process before offering these suggestions: Identify the capabilities needed  to make the e-commerce project successful; analyze the company's capability  gap [or gaps]; if necessary, hire an outside consultant with a compelling  track record and experienced people; anticipate the effort of integrating  back- and front-end systems; fix the time and cost of the e-commerce  development process; and finally, be prepared to modify the e-commerce  system after it goes into operation. Of course, how easy it is for Cohan  (or anyone else, for that matter) merely to stockpile all manner of  suggestions. As noted, Cohan anchors all of his suggestions within a  context. Moreover, the clusters are arranged in a logical sequence.<br />If  your organization is about to become significantly involved in e-commerce  or  if its involvement in e-commerce (thus far) has been unsatisfactory,  and you need the best single source of information and advice to guide your  initiatives, look no further.perienced people; anticipate the effort of integrating  back- and front-end systems; fix the time and cost of the e-commerce  development process; and finally, be prepared to modify the e-commerce  system after it goes into operation.

Hegained well-deserved praise for his previously published EmotionalIntelligence in which his focus was primarily on education. Only briefly in one chapter of that pioneering work did he suggest that his insights could perhaps have broader implications for any workplace; indeed, for organizational life throughout our entire society. How fortunate that he then began a two-year study to explore those broader implications. The results of his efforts are shared in Working with Emotional Intelligence.  It is a stunning achievement.<br />In the first chapter, Goleman observes: \\"The rules for work are changing. We're being judged by a new yardstick: not just by how smart we are, or by our training expertise, but also by how well we handle ourselves and each other. This yardstick is increasingly applied in choosing who will be hired and who will not, who will be let go and who will be retained, who passed over and who promoted.\\" As explained by Goleman, emotional intelligence is not simply \\"being nice\\" nor does it mean giving free rein to feelings -- \\"letting it all hang out.\\" Rather, \\"it means managing feelings so that they are expressed appropriately and effectively, enabling people to work together smoothly toward their common goals.\\" For many persons, perhaps, the descriptives \\"emotional\\" and \\"intelligent\\" are mutually exclusive. As does Howard Gardner in Intelligence Reframed, Goleman explains that each of us is blessed with a multiple of intelligences. They must be developed and nourished differently. All are needed. A mature person, therefore, is one who has her or his multiple intelligences (MI) is proper balance, who manages and expresses each in appropriate (hence effective) ways. All of us know highly analytical adults whose emotional development seems to have stopped in the \\"Terrible Two\\" phase. We also know other adults who possess exceptional sensitivities but are unable to complete the simplest of calculations.<br />Goleman organizes his material in five parts: Beyond Expertise, Self-Mastery, People Skills, A New Model of Learning, and The Emotionally Intelligent Organization. Goleman's purpose is to explain the importance of having \\"the capacity for recognizing our own feelings and those of others, for motivating ourselves, and for managing emotions well in ourselves and in our relationships.\\" If indeed any organization's \\"most valuable assets walk out the door at the end of each day\\", it stands to reason that every effort should be made to integrate and coordinate the multiple intelligences of those human assets.<br />For Goleman, the \\"good news\\" is that emotional intelligence can be learned. Therefore, at the individual level, elements of emotional intelligence must be identified, assessed, and upgraded. Only then can the \\"emotionally intelligent organization\\" be established and sustained. In his final remarks, Goleman observes: \\"But apart from the emotional intelligence of the organizations we work for, having these capabilities offers each of us a way to survive with our humanity and sanity intact, no matter where we work. And as work changes, these human capacities can help us not just to compete, but also nurture the capacity for pleasure, even joy, in our work.\\"<br />Even if your organization is unwilling and/or unable to become \\"emotionally intelligent\\", this book can be of incalculable value to your efforts to recognize and understand your feelings as well as those of others, to motivate yourself, and to manage your emotions more effectively...especially in your relationships with others, whoever and wherever they may be.xceptional sensitivities but are unable to complete the simplest of calculations.  <br />Goleman organizes his material in five parts: Beyond Expertise, Self-Mastery, People Skills, A New Model of Learning, and The Emotionally Intelligent Organization.

The first five chapters  examine:<br />Creative Genius -- What Makes the Difference?<br />Innovation,  Change, and the Creative Personality  Ten Reasons Why Traditional  Management Types Are Inept at Innovation<br />The Paradox of Innovation<br />The  Inno-visionary Personality<br />Inno-visionary and Creative Behavior<br />These  five chapters and the final chapter alone are well worth the price of the  book. Landrum devotes a separate chapter to each of 13 men, beginning with  Steven Jobs (Apple) and concluding with Ted Turner (CNN). To each he  assigns a dominant characteristic. For example, for Jobs \\"autocratic\\" and  for Turner \\"risk-taking.\\" According to which criteria did Landrum make his  selections? He explains in his Preface: Father of the Industry, Five-Year  Market Dominance, Technology or Market Created by the Entrepreneur,  Mass-Market Appeal, and Contemporary Development (ie since 1950).  I rate  this book as highly as I do for three reasons. First, Landrum defines his  standards of measurement with meticulous care. Second, he resists the  obvious temptation to manipulate his subjects to achieve a snug fit with  those standards of measurement. Finally, he provides a wealth of  information about each of the 13 which reveals their personal qualities as  well as their extraordinary achievements.<br />In the final chapter, Landrum  suggests that \\"The inno-visionary personality is necessary for the making  of the consummate entrepreneur and change master. This personal style is  available to anyone inclined to pursue it. These visionary leaders had it,  which gave them an ability to focus on goals and dreams, a macro vision to  see their dreams through to fruition, and the passionate energy to  persevere when all seemed lost.\\" These are indeed men with exceptional  vision and courage, determination and self-assurance, charisma and  intuition, passion and persuasiveness. How easy it is to list such  descriptives. How difficult it is to be worthy of them. As Landrum makes  abundantly clear, the 13 \\"creative men\\" are certainly worthy. Buy the book,  read the first five chapters with an open-mind, and then join the company  of those who have helped to create a world we are only now beginning to  understand.<br />If you admire this book as much as I do, you are encouraged  to read another of Landrum's books, Profiles of Female Genius. These 13  \\"creative women\\" can not only hold their own with Steve Jobs, Fred Smith,  Tom Monaghan, Nolan Bushnell, Bill Gates, Marcel Bich, Solomon Price,  Howard Head, William Lear, Soichiro Honda, Akio Morita, Arthur Jones, and  Ted Turner....they can hold their own with anyone.o vision to  see their dreams through to fruition, and the passionate energy to  persevere when all seemed lost.\\" These are indeed men with exceptional  vision and courage, determination and self-assurance, charisma and  intuition, passion and persuasiveness.

It is even more relevant now than it was then. Most organizations (including companies) still do not fully understand the interdependence of  connectivity with interactivity in relation to collaborative communication.  Stated another way, most organizations continue to focus on team-building  (\\"hot groups\\"), developing \\"total learning\\", etc. or on using intranets and  extranets, without bringing the two together, as DeKoven explains in  Connected Executives.<br />DeKoven refers to \\"company\\" or \\"companies\\" but he  is really talking about organizational structures of all kinds. Some are  more virtual than others. Some are larger than others. Some are more  advanced technologically than others. Whatever, all require executives who  are connected to whomever and whatever they need to be effective. Connected  Executives provides a step-by-step plan to maximize appropriate  interactivity. Because executives spent approximately 85% of their time and  energy in a \\"meeting\\" (or interaction) of one kind or another, it is  imperative that the organization within which they do so has an  \\"architecture\\" and \\"infrastructure\\" which ensure cohesive, comprehensive,  and cost-effective communication.<br />Remarkably, everything DeKoven suggests  about connecting executives is directly relevant to connecting customers.  The same communication strategies he identifies, once modified, can also be  used as website strategies. DeKoven defines \\"meeting\\" to include almost ANY  form of interactivity: face to face, voice to voice, voice to machine,  machine to machine, machine to voice, etc. Maximizing the impact and value  of connectivity requires both a system and a process but first, as DeKoven  carefully explains, one must clearly understand (a) who and what should be  involved, (b) when and where, (c) how, and most important (d) WHY? Unless  and until an organization answers questions such as these, why connect?  First things first.<br />...t things first. <br />...	2000-04-18

Given the fact that anyone who has a computer can now communicate with anyone else who also has a computer, any time, anywhere, there has indeed been an \\"explosion in connectivity\\" which we are  only now beginning to understand. Simultaneously, amidst various  detonations, a \\"tidal wave of universal connectivity is melting the glue  bonding economic activities together.\\"<br />This is an appropriate, indeed a  very clever title. I am reminded of Negroponte's Being Digital which offers  a probing examination of the \\"information highway\\" as a means by which to  transmit, globally, \\"weightless bits at the speed of light.\\" Because bits  are \\"the DNA of information\\", Negroponte's analysis of their nature and  impact helps us to benefit from as well as understand a \\"revolution\\" which  has only begun...the same \\"revolution\\" to which Evans and Wurster also  direct their attention.They do a brilliant job of explaining \\"how the new  economics of information transforms strategy.\\" The reader is advised (in  the Preface) that these \\"new economics\\" are NOT a \\"qualitatively new body  of principles\\"; rather, a \\"rebalancing of existing economic forces when one  of them (the informational glue) is subtracted.\\"<br />I was especially  impressed by the authors' probing analysis of various forces at work as a  new global balance evolves. Here is a brief excerpt from Chapter 2: \\"The  economics of information and the economics of things have been tied  together like participants in a three-legged race. Every business is  consequently a compromise between the economics of information and the  economics of things. Separating them breaks their mutual compromise and  potentially releases enormous economic value.\\" Sound familiar? Immediately  after reading this passage, I thought about those involved in the Manhattan  Project when they realized, for the first time, how much energy could be  released by nuclear fission. At the end of this and the other chapters, the  authors provide what they call (what else?) \\"Sound Bits.\\" They are  especially well-done as they summarize key points but lose much of their  value unless you have read the material which precedes then. In so many  books, end-of-chapter \\"key points\\" are all you need to read. Not so with  this book.<br />For Evans and Wurster, deconstruction and disintermediation  will be major forces as the \\"informational glue\\" melts. As a result of  their impact, as noted earlier, there will be a \\"rebalancing of existing  economic forces\\" in organizations which require a different kind of  leadership: \\"The traditional, hierarchically defined roles of leadership  become obsolete. But there remain two things that leaders, and only  leaders, can do\\": creature a culture which is a \\"purposeful community\\",  and, formulate strategies which will nourish and sustain that community. I  agree with Evans and Wurster that each organization's culture should serve  as the essence of identity, of management, of leadership. I also agree with  their concluding observation: \\"In a world of impersonal technical change,  that is a refreshingly human thought.\\" If your organization lacks such a  culture, if it does not understand how the new economics are transforming  strategy, here is an invaluable source for information, analysis, and  wisdom...also for inspiration.thors provide what they call (what else?) \\"Sound Bits.\\" They are  especially well-done as they summarize key points but lose much of their  value unless you have read the material which precedes then.

(These first seven chapters, all by themselves, are well worth the cost of  the book.) He assigns to each a dominant characteristic. For example, Mary  Kay Ash is \\"A Confident Charismatic\\"), Madonna is \\"Psychosexually Driven\\",  and Linda Wachner is a \\"Type A Workaholic.\\" All 13 are peak performers  within their respective careers. All have exceptional intelligence, talent,  energy, determination, and (perhaps most important of all) clearly defined  goals and objectives. All had to overcome all manner of obstacles, many of  them gender-specific. Also, as Landrum explains very well, each has a  unique, indeed compelling personality. As each overcomes obstacles, her  unique personality is most evident.<br />Some readers may disagree with the  selections and/or with Landrum's definition of \\"genius\\" as applied to each  of his selections. I rate this book so highly because it is well written,  because it provides so much information of which I was not previously  aware, and because (with great skill) Landrum allows each of these  remarkable women to reveal herself through what she has said and done.

What you have is a seamless blend of narrative with photographs, most of them taken by Frank Hurley throughout the expedition. The volume has been beautifully produced by  Alfred A. Knopf. However, with all due respect to aesthetics, the \\"story\\"  of that legendary expedition, brilliantly told by Caroline Alexander, is  what invests this volume with its compelling appeal. With skills worthy of  Homer, Dante, and Melville, she traces a series of voyages which began on  August 14, 1914, when Ernest Shackleton and his crew of 27 set sail for the  South Antarctic \\"in pursuit of the last unclaimed prize in the history of  exploration: the first crossing on foot of the Antarctic continent.\\"<br />Two  years later, on August 30, 1916, Alexander concludes her \\"story\\" with the  rescue of those crew members whom Shackleton was forced to leave behind on  Elephant Island. He and a few others rowed out to sea in the one remaining  boat, thus beginning another \\"story\\" which had a happy ending. Later, en  route home from Elephant Island, in a letter written to his wife,  Shackleton observes: \\"I have done it. Damn the Admiralty....Not a life lost  and we have been through Hell.\\"<br />No brief commentary such as this can  possibly suggest the nature and extent of heroism, terror, ingenuity, and  (yes) endurance which Alexander describes so vividly. They are all here in  a single volume, waiting for you to experience them almost as if you  yourself were a member of the crew.	2000-03-04

(I am unqualified to discuss this book as a scholarly work. For all I know, Ogden is a wizard or sorcerer and made most of it up.) I learned a great deal which I did not  know previously...and I enjoyed myself while doing so. In his Introduction,  Ogden explains:<br />Wizards are \\"magicians, from the first priests who used  trickery to entrance their congregations through the alchemists to  modern-day cabalists. Generally, they seek wisdom and mystic truths and  practice `white magic,' based on experimentation and gained through  apprenticeship, oral tradition, folklore or the study of arcane writings.  Their work tends to be beneficent, or at least benign, particularly to  their patrons.\\"<br />He then explains that sorcerers are \\"are the  practitioners of black magic and dark spells who call up the spirits of the  dead and the Underworld. Above all, sorcerers seek unlimited knowledge,  with a lust for power, control, and mastery of the universe. They wish to  use their powers to make them, in essence, gods.\\"<br />These brief excerpts  correctly suggest the tone, style, and thrust of Ogden's discussions of  subjects ranging from Abracadabra to Zoroaster. In effect, he has created  both an encyclopedia and a dictionary (deftly using the A to Z format) in  which he examines almost all forms and dimensions of \\"enchantment, magic  and the occult.\\" He notes that while the emphasis is on individuals, both  fictional and real, he has \\"covered relevant jargon and items from related  supernatural fields of study, as well as relevant aspects of popular  culture, such as films, theater, and comics.\\"<br />For me, one of the greatest  strengths of the book is that Ogden (within the obvious limitations of  space) suggests WHY so many people (throughout history) have been attracted  to \\"enchantment, magic and the occult.\\" Perhaps in a book he has yet to  write, Ogden will shift his attention to the implications of that  attraction. What is there in human nature which causes so many people to  worship other people, physical objects, even physical locations, natural  forces, etc.? Which human needs (perhaps unmet) do such objects of worship  serve? To what extent have the skills of the wizard and/or sorcerer been  demonstrated by historical figures such as Nero and Caligula...more  recently by Stalin and Hitler? Cult figures? Serial killers?<br />To repeat, I  learned a great deal from this book and enjoyed myself in the process. I  hope this brief commentary has helped you to decide whether or not you also  have an interest in knowing more about \\"enchantment, magic and the occult.\\"on.

Note: I read and reviewed this book when it was first published (1999) and recently re-read it before reading Michael Schrage's latest, The Innovator's Hypothesis: How Cheap Experiments Are Worth More Than Good Ideas (2014). Several of his core insights are introduced in the earlier book and developed in much greater depth inThe Innovator's Hypothesis. Here's a head's up to those about to read one or both books: Schrage assigns very specific -- and correct -- meaning to words such as \\"play\\" and \\"experiment\\"; also to statements such as \\"Innovative prototypes generate innovative teams. Not vice versa.\\" and \\"Ideas are the enemy...They'll make you sick.\\" His ideas are not for hamster brains and lazy bones.<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />There is more significance to the title than one may initially assume. Some \\"play\\" can be taken much too seriously as when overzealous parents scream at their children as they begin to compete in organized sports; other \\"play\\" is not treated seriously enough as when a corporation discourages (perhaps even punishes) innovative thinking unless it has an immediate and favorable impact on the bottom line. Many executives, thus abused, may then vent their frustrations by behaving boorishly at a Little League game.<br /><br />In the Foreword, Tom Peters quotes Schrage's assertion that \\"Innovative prototypes generate innovative teams. Not vice versa.\\" Peters then observes that, in Serious Play, the \\"big idea\\" is that \\"the prototyping process becomes the scaffolding\\" for an enterprise's approach to innovation. As Schrage explains, \\"I have always enjoyed rehearsals more than performances.\\" I suggest that you keep that statement clearly in mind as you proceed through the book. It reveals much about Schrage's perspective on the correlations between prototypes and innovation.<br /><br />Here is how the book is organized: Part I: Getting Real, Part II: Model Behavior, and Part III: S(t)imulating Innovation. Schrage then provides a User's Guide and Bibliography. Throughout the book, he shares a wealth of real-world experience which explains what innovation is, and, what it can help to accomplish, not only with the design of a new product or service but also with the formulation of new and better ways for people to work together. The key is simulation; moreover, \\"not just playing with representations of ideas\\" (lots of ideas, the more the better) but \\"playing with the various versions of representations of ideas.\\"<br /><br />Near the end of the final chapter, Schrage poses a number of critically important questions, suggesting that the \\"best hope for answering these questions, or coping with their implications, is to build or grow models and play with them seriously.\\" The world's best companies simulate to innovate. For example: American Airlines, Boeing, DaimlerChrysler, General Electric, IBM, IDEO, Walt Disney, Merrill Lynch, Microsoft, and Royal Dutch Shell. Schrage believes that the creative tensions between innovators who design and innovators who evolve \\"will likely result in breakthroughs in products, services, and their yet-to-be-anticipated hybrids.\\" So, why not prototype how to prototype? Why not play simulation games which reveal new and better ways to simulate?<br /><br />Tom Peters describes Serious Play as \\"simply the best book on innovation I've ever read.\\" I agree. Perhaps you will, also.shares a wealth of real-world experience which explains what innovation is, and, what it can help to accomplish, not only with the design of a new product or service but also with the formulation of new and better ways for people to work together.

The authors are to be commended, first for thinking about  writing such a book and then for doing it. The result is a brilliant piece  of work. The writing style has snap, crackle, and pop. The insights are of  great value as we are helped to correlate the circumstances in each movie  with the daily circumstances in which most of us are obliged to function  each day.<br />After you read this book, you will perhaps think of other  movies which also could have been discussed by the authors. For me (what  great fun!), I would nominate Paths of Glory, Zulu, Executive Suite,  Command Decision, Tunes of Glory, Braveheart, Jeremiah Johnson, Pork Chop  Hill, Pale Rider, and Patton.<br />If you are a movie buff, if you are looking  for a great read, and if you agree with me that much of value can be  learned about leadership from the movies, obtain a copy of this book ASAP.	2000-02-29

Either way, I rate  this book highly. It is well-written. The material is anchored in a wealth  of real-world experience. For each reader, some rules are probably more  relevant than are others...at least today. However, having had extensive  recent experience with several start-ups, I can attest that each of the 27  will become relevant at one time or another. I also think this book can be  of substantial value to senior-level executives of so-called \\"mature\\"  companies. Why? Because every company needs what I call a semi-annual or  quarterly (if not monthly)  \\"gut check\\" -- or \\"reality check\\" -- which  challenges all basic assumptions and premises concerning its vision,  mission, priorities, allocation of resources, positioning, core  competencies, customer relationships, competition, etc.<br />The authors  devote a separate chapter to each of the \\"Rules\\", with the 27 chapters  organized within seven Parts:<br />Part One: Do You Have What It  Takes?<br />Part Two: The Right Idea at the Right Time<br />Part Three:  Markets and Competition<br />Part Four: People<br />Part Five: Show Me  the Money!<br />Part Six: The Legal Side of Business<br />Part Seven:  Getting Out -- and Moving On<br />The book concludes with five Appendices: The  MoneyHunt Story,  Business Plan Template, Online Audition for MoneyHunt,  Legal Dos and Don'ts of Raising Capital, and Demystifying the Business  Organization. Although all of the material provided is solid and  well-presented, I was especially interested in Appendix A which explains  the origin and development of a television program on which entrepreneurs  (hunting for money, of course) appear.<br />Who will derive the greatest  benefit from this book? As previously suggested, those who are merely  thinking about launching a new company; also those who are preparing to  launch a new company; also those who have launched a company now  encountering serious problems; also those in a well-established company  which may be losing its competitive edge. Here's another category of reader  which I also want to include: Those involved in a large organization who  must compete aggressively each day for a share of that organization's  resources. For them, effective application of the 27 \\"Rules\\" will of course  require strategies and tactics which are substantially different from those  required when \\"creating and growing\\" a new enterprise.<br />The hunt for  money never ends because the need for money never ends. Unless you have  everything required to achieve your specific objectives, read and then  re-read the book. If and when circumstances tempt you to think that you can  relax a bit, read it again.e) appear.<br />Who will derive the greatest  benefit from this book?

Each has its limitations. All are necessary to my work. These self-references are shared inorder to suggest that the  Encarta World Dictionary will be praised by some, reviled by others. Given  its substantial cost, you are urged to (a) determine precisely what your  needs are and then (b) determine to what extent Encarta fills most (if not  all) of those needs. It was a welcome addition to my personal library. I  refer to it almost every day. When evaluating a dictionary such as this,  how important is the total number of words? This one offers comparably  fewer than others in its price range. How important are the origins of  words? I prefer other sources such as John Ayto's Dictionary of Word  Origins. How important is historical (especially biographical) material? In  this area, I rate the Encarta adequate. How current do you require a  dictionary to be? None other in its price range is more current. How  important to you is the nomenclature of the Internet and WWW? There are far  better sources if that is your primary reference need. No dictionary of  this scale can be everything to everyone. I rate it as highly as I do  because of its practical value to me. Also, because it is aesthetically  pleasing. I again urge you to determine what you need from a dictionary.  Examine the Encarta carefully and then judge for yourself.	2000-02-27

This is an illustrated history of human creativity with its primary focus on several hundred inventions. The range of inventions discussed extends from  \\"stone axes to silicon chips.\\" The book is lavishly, abundantly  illustrated. Vivid and compelling graphics include artists' renderings,  photographs, maps, and time lines of various eras, from \\"The Beginning of  Civilization\\" (Chapter 1) until \\"The Shrinking Earth\\" (Chapter 35). The  concluding chapter, \\"Into the Future\\", examines three driving forces:  convergence, communication, and collaboration. The reader is then provided  with an immensely useful Biographical Dictionary and Bibliography to pursue  in greater detail subjects of special interest.<br />Without the  illustrations, this book would still be a magnificent scholarly  achievement. Lest you be deterred, I hasten to add that its narrative  frequently reminded me of a novel such as Ken Follett's The Pillars of the  Earth. What I have is a \\"Revised Edition\\" of a work first published in  1987. For me, as already implied, this is one of the most entertaining as  well as one of the most informative books I have read in recent years.  Trevor I. Williams is identified as the author; William E. Schaaf, Jr. with  Arianne E. Burnette are credited wth the updating and revising of Williams'  original material. For purposes of convenience, I shall refer to them as  \\"the collaborators\\" and hope that no one takes offense.<br />The collaborators  examine those inventions which had especially great impact on the societies  in which they were introduced. These were inventions which, thousands of  years ago, created new industries (eg agriculture, construction, and  transportation) or transformed basic human activities (eg education,  communication, and war). Indeed, the term \\"revolution\\" is especially  appropriate when  we consider the impact of cereals, the domestication of  animals, irrigation, writing and the calendar, and farming implements  during what the collaborators refer to as \\"The Agricultural Revolution.\\"  With regard to the first half of the twentieth century, the collaborators  examine the impact of military technology during the First World War, new  sources of energy, new channels of communication, the emergence of travel  by road and air, new building techniques, and the rise of the chemical  industry. No brief commentary of mine can possibly do full justice to a  book such as this. It provides a feast for the mind as well as for the  eyes.

(The term itself is rapidly being replaced by \\"e-business which includes but is not limited to \\"commerce.\\") I think  the book will be especially helpful to school and college students as they  prepare themselves for careers. Also for others who may now be reluctant to  participate in conversations about the Internet and WWW. Also for still  others who need a \\"briefing\\" on how their organization can determine what  the nature and extent of its involvement in e-commerce can and should  be.<br />Rosen organizes her material within six chapters:<br />Chapter 1:  The  Internet Today<br />Chapter 2:  Identifying Your Direction<br />Chapter 3:  E-Commerce Technology<br />Chapter 4:  Creating E-Commerce Services<br />Chapter  5:  Hosting and Supporting E-Commerce<br />Chapter 6:  Marketing an E-Commerce  Site<br />Rosen also provide a crisp summary at the end of each chapter and  then a Glossary which is also well done. As the chapter titles and sequence  correctly suggest, Rosen begins with the \\"basics\\" (as Vince Lombardi always  did at the beginning of each new football season, assuming nothing) and  then skillfully guides her reader through the process by which to determine  appropriate organizational direction; then reviews various relevant  technologies; then suggests how e-commerce services can create unique value  (eg convenience); then explains what's involved in hosting and supporting  e-commerce; and then finally, provides some excellent advice on the  all-important task of marketing a website (or Web site).<br />Is this the  definitive book in the subject? No. It wasn't intended to be. (Nor could  any one book ever be. The business world is changing too fast.)  Will this  book be helpful to substantial numbers of people? You bet. Were I the owner  of a small-to-midsize company, for example, and we were planning to get  heavily involved in e-commerce, I'd buy a copy for every key person in the  company and then conduct a rigorous group discussion of it.

Our purpose in writing this book is to help people at all levels  of the organization to create, support, and rebuild trust in themselves and  within their organizations.\\"  Here is how their book is organized:<br />Part I  Understanding Trust and Betrayal<br />Part II Transactional Trust (Three  Types)<br />Part III Transformative Trust<br />The material consists of  sharply-focused analysis, mini-case studies anchored in real-world  experiences, a series of checklists, and then at the conclusion of each  chapter a summary of key points followed by \\"Ideas in Action.\\" Together,  this combination of analysis and information helps to explain HOW to  establish and then sustain trust throughout any organization. The authors  also offer some practical advice on how to recover from betrayal, once  experienced: Observe and acknowledge what has happened, allow your feelings  to surface, get support, reframe the experience, forgive yourself and  others, and finally let go and move on. Most of us have experienced  betrayal in personal relationships and many of us have also experienced  organizational betrayal. It can indeed be painful.<br />The authors assert  that first you must trust yourself; if you don't, you probably cannot or  will not trust another person. Next, give trust to others inorder to obtain  it. Trust another's character. Years ago, Stan Smith lost a major tennis  title to Arthur Ashe after a call against Smith which enraged the crowd.  Later, Smith agreed that losing the point was the turning point in the  match. He then added, \\"But if Arthur said my shot was out, that's good  enough for me.\\"<br />Trust another's competence. \\"I know you can do it. I  have total confidence in your abilities.\\" Most of the time (not always),  the person told this will then do everything humanly possible to prove  worthy of such trust.<br />Trust those with whom you work closely. Small  concentrations of trust within a branch office, department or business unit  can frequently develop a momentum which has much wider and deeper impact.  That, in essence, is what \\"transformative trust\\" is all about. The Reinas  explain this quite well in Part III.<br />The Reinas conclude their book with  a series of questions which will help the reader to determine the nature  and extent of trust within her orn his own organization, and, to determine  what needs to be done to increase it effectively. There is no break-through  thinking in this book...nor do the Reinas claim to offer any.

And yes, obviously, without momentum, efforts to energize or re-energize any organization will fail.<br />My own experience suggests that there will then be at least three whatever was undertaken was doomed to fail; also, therefore, that such efforts should never be undertaken again; finally, defenders of the status quo (whatever it may be) will become even more aggressive in their opposition to change in almost any form.<br />Of course, Senge understood full well when he wrote The Fifth Discipline that those who attempted to implement an appropriate (emphasis on \\"appropriate\\") combination of his ideas and suggestions would encounter all manner of resistance. In my opinion, that is why he then co-authored the Fieldbook. (I strongly suggest that it be read only after reading The Fifth Discipline.) Here is how The Dance of Change Change)<br />The Challenges of Initiating (Not Enough Time, No Help [Coaching and Support], Not Relevant, Walk the Talk)<br />The Challenges of Sustaining Transformation (Fear and Anxiety, Assessment and Measurement, True Believers and Nonbelievers)<br />The Challenges of Redesigning and Rethinking (Governance, Diffusion, Strategies Purpose)<br />As you can see, Senge and his co-authors provide a cohesive and comprehensive system with which to achieve and then sustain (emphasis on \\"sustain\\") \\"profound change.\\" Once again, I want to stress the importance of carefully selecting what is most appropriate from this wealth of material. The selection process should be unhurried but expeditious. It should include only those who are wholeheartedly committed to achieving \\"profound change.\\" Moreover, their number should not threaten effective communication and collaboration. My final suggestion (not necessarily Senge's) is to proceed with a \\"Big Picture\\" clearly in mind but to focus on the sequential completion of specific tasks according to plan.

It is important to keep in mind that \\"total learning\\" is a misnomer. We can never learn  everything it is possible to learn (are you fluent in Mandarin Chinese?)  nor can we ever learn all of the possible applications of what we do know.  Senge's objective is to help all organizations (regardless of nature or  size) to optimize opportunities for appropriate learning, and, to assist  everyone involved to optimize the results of their efforts to learn. What  several other reviewers have either ignored or minimized is Senge's  substantial contribution to our understanding of effective, sustainable  change within any organizational structure.

Senge organizes The Fifth Discipline as follows:<br />Part I How  our Actions Create Our Reality...and How We Can Change It<br />Part II The  Fifth Discipline: The Cornerstone of the Learning Organization<br />Part III  The Core Disciplines: Building the Learning Organization<br />Part IV  Prototypes<br />Part V Coda<br />According to Senge, there are five new  \\"component technologies\\" which are gradually converging to innovate  learning organizations: Systems Thinking (\\"invisible fabrics of  interrelated actions\\"), Personal Mastery (of various skills at the highest  possible level), Mental Models (\\"deeply engrained assumptions,  generalizations, or even pictures or images\\" which influence learning),  Building Shared Vision (of \\"a set of principles and guiding practices\\"  which help to define \\"pictures of the future\\"), and finally Team Learning  (based on  dialogue which enables effective collaboration). The book  examines each of these five separate but interdependent \\"disciplines\\" with  meticulous care and compelling eloquence.<br />Organizations as well as those  who comprise them can (and often do) have learning disabilities. For  example, what I call the Negative Self-Fulfilling Prophecy: \\"I can't do  \\"it\\" or \\"We can't do \\"it.\\" The prophecy is then fulfilled (of course) as if  it had been expressed by the Oracle at Delphi. Senge is well-aware of  learning disabilities. Within the framework of his narrative, he suggests a  number of practical strategies and tactics to overcome them.

Why?  Because change is the only constant and it can occur in seconds rather than  in years or even days. Because there is now so much more information to  absorb, digest, and evaluate. Because organizations are (finally) beginning  to recognize their under-utilization of their \\"human capital\\" and need  immediate assistance. I give The Fifth Discipline the highest possible  rating and conclude my review of it by quoting Derek Bok's response when  parents of Harvard students complained about a tuition increase: \\"If you  think education is expensive, try ignorance.\\"<br />Those who share my high  regard for this book are encouraged to read William Isaacs' Dialogue, also.

There is a great need for what this book provides,  especially now as organizations are (finally) beginning to appreciate the  importance of supporting (indeed nourishing) the personal as well as the  professional development of their \\"human capital\\" The word \\"dialogue\\"  denotes conversation between two or more persons. Moreover, the original  meaning of the word \\"conversation\\" is to turn around, to transform; later,  the word's meaning evolved to \\"living, dwelling, and associating with  others.\\" Today, most of us think of conversation as \\"talk.\\" Some of us  think of it as a \\"lost art.\\" Isaacs obviously has both words clearly in  mind as he introduces his \\"pioneering approach.\\" His purpose is to explain  HOW effective dialogue, dialogue which is \\"about a shared inquiry, a way of  thinking and reflecting together\\", can increase and enhance human dignity  and understanding. How important is face-to-face communication? My own  opinion is that it is more important now than ever before. However, again  my opinion, the quality of face-to-face communication has rapidly  deteriorated in this age of high-speed electronic \\"connectivity.\\"<br />Isaacs' book is organized into five \\"Parts\\": What Is Dialogue; Building  Capacity for New Behavior (ie listening, respecting, suspending, and  voicing); Predictive Intuition; Architecture of the Invisible; and Widening  the Circle.  several  For me, one of the most important of Isaacs' themes  is so obvious, so simple: Show your respect for others by listening  carefully to what they say. Dialogue worthy of the name is based on mutual  respect. Hence the importance of attitude. Dialogue worthy of the name  requires mastery of certain skills which can be taught. Isaacs provides all  manner of practical suggestions as to HOW (a) to establish the proper  attitude within any organization and (b) to strengthen the specific skills  needed to sustain that attitude.<br />Near the end of his brilliant book,  Isaacs observes: \\"Dialogue enables a `free flow of meaning,' which has the  potential of transforming the power relationships among the people  concerned. As this free flow emerges, it becomes quite apparent that no one  person owns this flow and that no one can legislate it. People can learn to  embody it, and in a sense serve it. This is perhaps the most significant  shift possible in dialogue: that power is no longer the province of a  person in a role, or any single individual, but at the level of alignment  an individual or group has with Life itself.\\" If the comments expressed in  this brief excerpt speak to your own needs and/or the needs of your  organization, you don't need my endorsement.

It has two separate but related meanings: a stone used to measure (or test) the quality of  metals, such as gold and silver; also, a means by which to determine  authenticity. The title of Loewenstein's book suggests that he will discuss  \\"the\\" (not \\"a\\") touchstone of \\"life.\\" Hmmm. My curiosity was aroused.<br />For  me, reading this book proved to be a difficult but rewarding intellectual  experience. In it, Loewenstein examines molecular information, cell  communication, and the \\"foundations of life.\\" His original purpose was to  write a book about intercellular communication but, as he got to \\"the  heart\\" of this subject, \\"a picture materialized seemingly out of the blue:  a continuous intra- and intercellular network where, with DNA at the core,  molecular information flowed in gracefully interlaced circles. That  apparition had an allure I could not resist, and so this became a book  about information.\\"<br />The timing of the book's publication (1999)  coincides with (a) numerous and significant revelations concerning the  interaction of the brain with the mind and (b) rapid development of the  Internet, especially of the WWW. As a non-scientist, I was fascinated by  Loewenstein's analysis of \\"interlaced circles\\" and their relevance to the  technological transmission of information. (In Holding On to Reality,  Albert Borgmann addresses several of the same issues Loewenstein does but  from somewhat different perspectives.) As Loewenstein explains in the  Introduction, he set out to prove that \\"this information flow, not energy  per se, is the prime mover of life -- that molecular information flowing in  circles brings forth the organization we call `organism' and maintains it  against the ever-present disorganizing pressures in the physics universe.  So viewed, the information circle becomes the unit of life.\\"<br />Part One  introduces the entity Information; Part Two \\"takes up the full-grown weft  of circles, the intracellular communication network; Part Three deals with  the intercellular communication network, \\"the web that ties all cells of an  organism together; and Part Four provides \\"a short philosophical foray  where we see the principle [ie the principle of information economy which  is, for Loewenstein, the guiding principle of biological evolution] through  to its heuristic conclusion.\\"  Who will most enjoy reading this book?  Loewenstein claims to have written it both for the scientist and other  reader with an interest in science...\\"no specialized knowledge of biology  or physics is assumed in advance.\\" In my opinion, however, such knowledge  would be very helpful. Back to the question. As a non-scientist, I highly  recommend it to all the other non-scientists out there who occupy  decision-making positions in their organizations and who ask the following  questions:<br />1. What is the nature of \\"the information circle\\"?<br />2.  What are its primary functions, possible applications, and potential  benefits?<br />3. What is its relevance to the Internet and, especially,  to the WWW?<br />4. Finally, how can the answers to these first three  questions be of specific value to my own organization?<br />Loewenstein  provides (or at least suggests) answers to #1-3. In process, he helps his  reader to determine an appropriate answer to #4. Although I have neither  gold nor silver of questionable quality, I do have some business issues of  questionable authenticity which Loewenstein has prepared me to address with  much greater precision.entity Information; Part Two \\"takes up the full-grown weft  of circles, the intracellular communication network; Part Three deals with  the intercellular communication network, \\"the web that ties all cells of an  organism together; and Part Four provides \\"a short philosophical foray  where we see the principle [ie the principle of information economy which  is, for Loewenstein, the guiding principle of biological evolution] through  to its heuristic conclusion.\\"    Who will most enjoy reading this book?

Those who have already read The Art of the Long View no doubt share my high regard for the vision, precision, and eloquence which Peter Schwartz brings to subjects of special interest to him. They are once again in  evidence (indeed in abundance) in this book which he co-authored with Peter  Leyden and Joel Hyatt. Theirs is a shared vision of \\"the coming age of  prosperity.\\" What exactly does that mean? The answer is suggested in the  Introduction: \\"The Long Boom is a positive meme about a better future. A  meme is a contagious idea that can quickly spread around the world and  influence what people think and do....The idea soon takes on a life of its  own, out of anybody's control, flitting from computer host to computer host  in an exponential expansion that spreads around the world....[The book]  starts with the recognition that the world is faced with a historic  opportunity. What we call the Long Boom -- the years from 1980 to 2020 --is  a period of global transformation. No other age ever possessed the tools or  the knowledge to do what we can do today.\\" From the authors' perspective,  what they call the Long Boom is half in the past and half in the future.  \\"We refer to the Long Boom in both senses throughout the book.\\"<br />There are  four Parts followed by an Afterword.<br />Part I Track the Inevitable (ie  major developments in technology, economics and politics)<br />Part II The  Politics of the Long Boom (ie how to overcome \\"looming political  problems\\")<br />Part III The Engines of the Twenty-First Century (ie  technologies which can help to preserve the environment)<br />Part IV  Birth of a Global Civilization (ie creation of a new middle class amidst  fundamental global changes)<br />In the forward-thinking Afterword, the  authors reaffirm their faith in the almost unlimited potentialities of the  Long Boom IF the human race can somehow avoid committing planetary suicide.  They are emphatically NOT misty-eyed visionaries; on the contrary, they  seem most comfortable when addressing harsh realities such as territorial  \\"politics\\" which, if permitted, can result in the Long Whimper. Among their  objectives is to provide \\"a starting point for an ongoing global  conversation about how everyone can take advantage of the great potential  of our era and create a better world.\\" The observations shared are anchored  in the real-world; the suggestions offered are practical and do-able. If  for whatever reasons the human race is unwilling and/or unable to fulfill  the promise of the Long Boom, who to blame? According to Pogo, \\"We have met  the enemy and he is us.\\" Schwartz, Leyden &amp; Hyatt would perhaps reply,  \\"OK but so what? There's still time. There's still hope. We have everything  we need. Let's work together on a global basis. It won't be easy but we can  do it. We really can.\\"<br />How? This brilliant book answers that question.  Better yet, it explains why.<br />Those whose minds and hearts are nourished  by this book should also check out Natural Capitalism (Hawken, Lovins &amp;  Lovins) and Holding On to Reality (Borgmann) which address many of the same  issues but from somewhat different perspectives.ost comfortable when addressing harsh realities such as territorial  \\"politics\\" which, if permitted, can result in the Long Whimper.

Michael Lewis makes a substantial contribution to our efforts to understand what is happening now in today's business world...and what is likely to occur next. His is \\"a Silicon Valley story.\\" As such, it has the  obligatory plot and characters as well as a number of themes which he  carefully develops. The net result is both informative and  entertaining.<br />Exactly what is \\"the new new thing\\"? This moment's answer  may be wrong by the time you finish reading this sentence. Really? Yes.  Especially in the Silicon Valley, the next \\"new new thing\\" is the 21st  century's equivalent of the Holy Grail. The problem is, as Lewis carefully  explains, it is  often an illusion..and even when manifest, it can so  quickly become obsolete. \\"Silicon Valley to the United States what the  United States is to the rest of the world.\\" What is that? Briefly, \\"the  capital of innovation, of material prosperity, of a certain kind of energy,  of certain kinds of freedom, and of transience.\\" As I soon discovered when  reading the first few chapters, Lewis has written a literary hybrid: it  combines the dominant features of the picaresque novel (featuring a central  character who seeks and experiences a series of adventures) with the  sequential essay (separate but interdependent discussions of a common  subject). Lewis introduces his concept of \\"the searcher\\" who seeks the \\"new  new thing\\" and &quot;conforms to no well-established idea of what people  should do for a living. He gropes. Finding the new new thing is as much a  matter of timing as of technical or financial aptitude, though both of  those qualities help.\\" Lewis employs the searcher inorder to examine -- and  understand -- a process which creates \\"fantastic wealth\\" in the Silicon  Valley. The searcher is a \\"disruptive force\\" as he gropes his way along,  constantly on the move...his mind moving much more quickly than his feet,  preferring to live perpetually \\"with that sweet tingling discomfort of not  quite knowing what whatit is he wants to say. It is one of the little  ironies of economic progress that, while it often results in greater levels  of comfort, it depends on people who prefer not to get too comfortable.\\"  The searcher, for example.<br />Are we to believe that people who grope their  way through life, wandering through the Silicon Valley, are playing a major  role (a wholly new role) in wealth creation? Exactly. (This is a mentality  and a behavior which Guy Claxton discusses so well in Hair Brain Tortoise  Mind.) The main character of this story \\"had a structure to his life. He  might not care to acknowledge it, but it was there all the same. It was the  structure of an old-fashioned adventure story. His mere presence on a scene  inspired the question that propels every adventure story forward: What will  happen next? I had no idea. And neither, really, did he.\\"<br />Throughout this  book, as Lewis casually but precisely tells his \\"story\\", we are introduced  to some of one of the most successful  residents of the Silicon Valley, Jim  Clark, who proves to be the &quot;story's&quot; central character. For  Lewis, Clark embodies \\"a vast paradigm shift in American culture\\" from  conventional models and visions of success toward an entirely new way of  thinking about the world and control of it. Central to Lewis' discussion of  Clark is Clark's sailboat Hyperion, the world's tallest single-mast vessel.  There seems to be a progressive pattern of symbiotic relationships: United  States &lt; &gt; Silicon Valley &lt; &gt; the searcher &lt; &gt; Jim Clark  &lt; &gt; Netscape &lt; &gt; Healtheon &lt; &gt; Hyperion &lt; &gt; ?  Revealingly, in Lewis' Epilogue, we are told that Clark has already begun  work on the design of a new sailboat.  \\"Hyperion was nice, but this...this  was the perfect boat.\\" At least for now. <br />What Lewis reveals is a  restless mentality in constant search of the next \\"new new thing.\\" His  focal point may be Clark but, in my opinion, he is really examining the  global economy in the 21st century which will continue to be driven by that  mentality. There will always be a newer, better browser...a newer, better  sailboat...a newer, better whatever. Men and women unknown to us now are  \\"groping\\" to find them. And eventually they will...but will not then be  satisfied. &quot;Searchers&quot; never are.	2000-02-09

That is to say, the authors explain with both  eloquence and precision the necessity (not merely the desirability) of  creating value with every effort...in every collaborative relationship.<br />Think about it. Businesses of various kinds now spend (annually) $80-100  BILLION on consulting services. Are they receiving full (or at least  satisfactory) value for such expenditures? Probably not. However, blame  must be shared. Heaven knows, there are dishonest or incompetent  consultants, be they independent or associated with a firm. There are also  clients who are so confused and/or so corrupt, who create so many problems,  clients who are so unrealistic in terms of their expectations, that even  Peter Drucker in collaboration with Sun Tzu, Plato &amp; Aristotle,  Michelangelo, Leonardo de Vinci, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Tom  Peters could not possibly provide the services for which they have been  retained.<br />This book is divided into four Parts: Bad Habits and The  Challenge of Differentiation (examines \\"three consistent patterns  perpetuating the negative trends\\"), Becoming a Value-Creating Consultant  (examines \\"those behaviors and characteristics of consultants that win  [clients'] loyalty and respect\\"), The Partners and the Partnership  (examines \\"the behaviors that make for a good client and the role of the  consultant in helping to develop those behaviors in the client\\"), and  Conquering the Engagement from Hell (presents a \\"simulation that serves as  a culminating activity for readers to reflect on their learning and to  practice their skills\\"). The authors seem to share my own passion for  consulting at the very highest level at which superior (measurable)  performance is rewarded fairly and (yes) punctually. Unfortunately, as the  authors point out, \\"the consulting profession is on a trajectory. A  negative one. All someone has to do is mention the word lawyer [in italics]  and instant disdain, distrust, frustration, and skepticism are conjured up.  Without change, the word consultant [in italics] will soon produce the same  reactions.\\"<br />In my opinion, that of an independent management consultant,  this book makes a major contribution to understanding what must be done to  establish a positive \\"trajectory\\" for the consulting profession. Who should  read this book? Those who are now thinking about becoming consultants.  Also, those who are now consultants and dissatisfied with their client  relationships. Also, those who are about to work with consultants for the  first time. Finally, those who are now working with consultants and are  eager to maximize the value of that relationship. As previously suggested,  I think the material which Caruci &amp; Tetenbaum provide has relevance far  beyond both sides of a consulting relationship. Many of those involved in  any kind of a relationship (be it personal or professional) want to add  value to it. Caruci &amp; Tetenbaum explain HOW.

Corporations that mapped out five-year strategic plans now review their  strategies monthly.\\" Quite true. They then identify  and briefly discuss  four: The Era of Internationalization (1984-1990), The Era of Global  Convergence (1990-1994), The Era of Global Consolidation (1994-1996), and  The Era of Acceleration (1998-2020?). The 29 commentaries are then  distributed within eight chapters...for each of which the authors provide a  brief introduction.<br />The naming and dating of these eras is much less  important than the authors' comments which are coordinated with what the  various CEOs have to say. Each CEO has selected a specific subject to  discuss. Together, the 29 CEOs represent a wide range of global  corporations which, in turn, represent an equally wide range of industries.  It remains for each reader to determine which subjects are of greatest  interest; also, to determine which CEOs' comments have the greatest value.  Obviously, space does not permit a complete list of the commentaries and  their authors. It would be rude to provide a partial list which excludes  any of them.<br />For whom was this book written? My guess (just a guess) is  that at some point, Dauphinais, Means &amp; Price agreed that the general  subject of \\"pressing business challenges\\" on a global basis would be an  interesting subject for a book published in 2000. Perhaps they then  considered co-authoring one. What we now have is a conceptual framework  which they devised within which are clustered the observations of CEOs who  (with their associates) face various \\"pressing business challenges\\" each  and every waking moment. The book therefore, in my opinion, was written for  whose who appreciate having such a framework, and, who are eager to know  what these various CEOs have to say.<br />Because of the Internet and  especially the WWW, by 2002 or 2003 at the latest, I am convinced that  almost all companies (at least in North America) will either compete on a  global basis or be strategically involved somehow with those which do. I  conclude, therefore, that the collective \\"wisdom\\" provided by those who  head 29 of the world's largest corporations has significant implications  now for many other companies...also, that those implications will have even  greater significance for most (if not all) other companies within the next  12-24 months.<br />If this brief commentary has stimulated your interest, I  suggest that you obtain a copy of Wisdom of the CEO and check out the Table  of Contents. Determine for yourself this book appeals to you as much as it  did to me. Most of us have few opportunities to share the thoughts of even  one CEO of a major global corporation.

Thanks to Dauphinais, Means &amp;  Price, we can now do so with 29.	2000-02-03

In Experiential Marketing, Schmitt provides a much more detailed exposition of the limitations of traditional features-and-benefits marketing. Moreover, he moves beyond the sensory \\"framework\\" into several new dimensions, introducing what he calls \\"a new model\\" which will enable marketers to manage \\"all types of experiences, integrating them into holistic experiences\\" while \\"addressing key structural, strategic, and organizational challenges.\\" The key word is \\"holistic\\"; the key process is Issues<br />Epilogue<br />In his Preface, Schmitt introduces his reader to someone he identifies as \\"Laura Brown.\\" At the end of each of the 11 chapters, Laura Brown reacts to the material presented. Often, she responds with questions which the reader may be tempted to ask.  For products but what if a company is an industrial firm? What if it is a consulting firm or a medical practice? How does experiential marketing come into play for these kinds of companies?\\" Or at the end of Chapter via a brand?  What kind of communities are the 'brand communities'? What about communities of real people?\\"<br />Obviously Schmitt is a clever fellow. He includes Laura Brown (who turns out to be a real person) to respond to his material with questions such as these so that, in effect, he can say \\"I am so glad that you asked me about that!\\" Of course, he then answers the questions. This interaction is playful, adding humor; it is also a brilliant device by which to expand and enrich the flow of Schmitt's ideas.<br />They are very important ideas indeed. Simultaneously, Schmitt establishes a rock-solid conceptual infrastructure while examining a number of different companies (eg Nokia, Procter &amp; Gamble, Apple Computer, Volkswagen, Siemens, Martha Stewart Living, and SONY) which demonstrate the fundamental principles of Experiential Marketing. One of the book's most valuable contributions is provided in Part Two as Schmitt focuses on what he calls Strategic Experiential Modules (SEMs), each of which has its own distinct structures and principles which must be understood by each manager. SEMs include sensory experiences (SENSE), affective experiences (FEEL), creative cognitive experiences (THINK), physical experiences and entire lifestyles (ACT), and social-identity experiences (RELATE). Schmitt examines each, explains how to achieve the effective integration of all four.<br />In the Epilogue, he reveals Laura Brown's identity (no surprise there), suggesting that the experience-oriented organization is a \\"Dionysian organization and focuses on creativity and innovation...it takes a broad, helicopter view focusing on long-term trends, pays attention to its physical environment, and views its employees as human capital.\\" Indeed, he hastens to add, \\"the experience-oriented organization is keenly interested in promoting its employees' experiential growth.\\" Schmitt thus offers an alternative to the traditional organization which is oriented toward order, structure, analysis, and short term.<br />If you read Experiential Marketing and then share my high regard for it, I urge you to read also (if you have not already done so) The Experience Economy and The Entertainment Economy.hich demonstrate the fundamental principles of Experiential Marketing.

That is the first thesis of this  book....The book's second and ultimately more important thesis is that hot  groups are not good just for organizations. They are also good for people.  They offer individuals  opportunities to find meaning and ennoblement  through their work. In our fast and impermanent new organizational world,  those who work in organizations -- and that includes most of us -- both  expect and deserve such opportunities.\\" Here is how the book is  organized:<br />Part I  Hot Groups: What They Are and Why They're  Hot<br />Part II Who Needs Hot Groups? And Who Seeds New Ones?<br />Part III  How Do Hot Groups Operate?<br />Part IV An Optimistic View of What's  Ahead<br />At this point early in my review, I want to stress that a \\"hot  group\\" should be the logical, indeed inevitable result of a way at looking  at organizational renewal. Think of the \\"hot group\\" concept as precisely  that: a concept which affirms the value of a process by which individual  members of any organization (regardless of its size or nature) can  effectively collaborate. These members are \\"task-obsessed and full of  passion.\\" They share a style which is \\"intense, sharply focused, and full  bore.\\" Moreover, members of a \\"hot group\\" feel engaged in \\"an important,  even vital and personally ennobling mission\\"; their task is \\"dominates all  other considerations\\"; and although a \\"hot group\\" tends to remain intact  only for a relatively short period of time, it is \\"remembered nostalgically  and in considerable detail by its members.\\"<br />Such groups require  effective leadership. In Chapter 6, Lipman-Blumen and Leavitt address this  issue, suggesting a number of specific \\"options\\" when \\"hot group\\" is  assembled and then charged with its mission. For example: \\"To develop a  hot, task-obsessed group, think about people before you begin laying out a  flow chart. Bring on the people. Getting the task done is not your solo  job. It's the whole group's job.\\" The leader is urged to \\"recruit wild  ducks\\", then help the group to bring the right people in, to get the wrong  people out, and with unexpected departures. According to the authors, there  are two kinds of c\\"wars\\" and \\"races.\\" In wars, the goal is to destroy the  enemy; in races, the goal is not to destroy but to out-perform others.  Also, \\"at least as much\\", to have members outperform themselves, to exceed  their personal best.<br />In my opinion, this brilliant book makes two  immensely important contributions to our understanding of what it takes to  achieve superior organizational performance. First, it explains what the  members of a \\"hot group\\" can themselves accomplish if given the leadership,  freedom, and resources needed. Second, it explains what the positive impact  of such a group can have on all others within the same organization.  Paradoxically, a \\"hot group\\" is most effective within an organization that  has stability, solid and enlightened management, and sufficient resources  to support the group's efforts. That is certainly true of those associated  with Xerox PARC, the Manhattan Project, Lockheed's \\"Skunk Works\\", and the  Disney studios which produced the first full-length animated films.<br />If an  organization is unwilling and/or unable to tolerate a \\"small, egalitarian,  disordered\\" but NOT disorganized \\"hot group\\", it probably has problems  which even the hottest of \\"hot groups\\" cannot solve.before you begin laying out a  flow chart.

Part I consists of three chapters: What Makes Business Leaders Great, Evaluating Today's Business  Leaders, and Methodology: A Closer Look at the Numbers. The authors then  proceed to 50 \\"Profiles\\" in Part II, beginning (in alphabetical order) with  Mike Armstrong (AT&amp;T) and concluding with Jack Welch (GE). Part III  consists of three chapters: The 51st Business Leader: Peter Drucker, Doing  the Right Things Right: A New Definition of Business Success, and Common  Traits: A Prescription for Success in Business. The reader is then provided  with three Appendices to supplement and enrich the material which precedes  them. So much for the book's organization.<br />There are several reasons why  I rate this book so highly. First, as previously indicated, it is  exceptionally well-written. Also, each of the 50 \\"Profiles\\" probes deeply  into the specific talents and skills of its subject. Biographical  information and quotations supplement the authors' own analyses. Moreover,  each \\"Profile\\" illustrates a key point. For example, the discussion of Bill  Steere (Pfizer) illuminates the implications of his assertion that \\"Fads  come. Fads go. We concentrate on what we do best.\\" In the  &quot;Profile&quot; of him, Jack Welch observes \\"I don't think anyone  appreciates the value of informal.\\" Obviously, Welch does. I also was very  impressed by the quality of the content of Part III. The discussion of  Peter Drucker is among the most insightful I have ever read. The authors  redefine \\"business success in the next chapter and then review the \\"common  traits\\" of the 50 great business leaders they have analyzed. For those who  are eager to learn, the \\"lessons\\" identified and then discussed by Neff and  Citrin are invaluable.	2000-01-31

First of all, I urge anyone thinking about buying this brilliant book also to consider (or to re-read) Schmitt's Experiential Marketing and Wolf's The Entertainment Economy. Although the three books differ significantly in  terms of thrust and content, together they help us to understand a New  Economy which is perhaps best exemplified by Las Vegas. According to Pine  &amp; Gilmore, \\"Virtually everything [italics] about Las Vegas is a  designed experience, from the slot machines at the airport to the gambling  casinos that line the Strip, from the themed hotels and restaurants to the  singing, circus, and magic shows; and from the Forum Shops mall that  recreates ancient Rome to the amusement parks, thrill rides, video arcades,  and carnival-style games that attract the twentysomethings and give older  parents a reason to bring their kids in tow.\\"<br />Pine &amp; Gilmore explain  The Experience Economy; Wolf calls it The Entertainment Economy. Schmitt  suggests that Experiential Marketing creates or sustains demand for this  New Economy, however it is named. For all of these authors, \\"work\\" should  be viewed as \\"theatre\\" and every business should be viewed as a \\"stage.\\" If  they are correct (and I believe they are), the quality of sensory  experience is critically important. That is to say, it is no longer  sufficient to offer high-quality goods or services for sale at competitive  prices. Most (if not all) goods and services have become commodities.  Competing on price alone seldom succeeds...especially against those which  have superior purchasing power. Competing on quality alone succeeds only  for those who offer what no one else has. The challenge is to achieve  differentiation. According to Pine &amp; Gilmore, this challenge is best  met by understanding what the Experience Economy is (and isn't) as well as  how it works; only then, thus informed, can an organization (almost  literally) function as a theatre company: formulating a script which has  both an exciting story line and interesting characters; assigning roles to  those who have the appropriate talents; and then conducting rigorous  rehearsals. Finally, it's \\"show time\\"!<br />Pine &amp; Gilmore observe,  \\"Since all commerce is moral choice, every business is a stage for  glorifying something. Who or what does your business glorify? Your answer  may not help you accept what is next, but it will certainly help guide what  you do today.\\" At its best, live theatre can delight, amuse, excite, inform  and even inspire those who experience it. Why cannot it also be true of  business relationships? Of course it can. It is certainly true of those  organizations which prosper. Southwest Airlines is but one example. Its CEO  once observed:<br /> &quot;I keep telling [those interested in Southwest  Airlines]  that the  intangibles are far more important than  the tangibles in the  competitive world because, obviously,  you can replicate the  tangibles. You can get the same  airplanes. You can get the same  ticket counters. You can get the  same computers. But the hardest  thing for a competitor to match  is your culture and the spirit of  your people and their focus on  customer service because that isn't  something you can do  overnight and it isn't something you can do  without a great deal  of attention every day in a thousand different  ways. That is why  I say that our employees are our competitive  protection.&quot;<br />Kelleher's comments are relevant to virtually all  organizations which now struggle to succeed in the New Economy (however it  is named).

My own experience suggests that the fastest growing companies usually have  several \\"secrets\\" which are soon revealed (or discovered) and thus lose  much of their &quot;mystique.&quot; Moreover, this same experience suggests  that whatever secrets the fastest growing companies may share in common  (speed, focus, innovation, tenacity, etc.) have already been  well-documented. These are some of the reasons why I did not rate this book  higher. However, for certain readers, I think it offers several substantial  benefits.<br />Here is how the book is organized. First, in Chapter 1,  Sherwin explains \\"The Back of the Napkin Analysis\\" and \\"The 45-Second  Business Plan\\" to sharpen the reader's focus. Next, he asks a number of  basic but essential questions (a total of 44) which \\"you will need to  answer if you are to successfully compete in a high-tech world. In a few  hours, you will get help organizing your thoughts and planning your  business.\\" Finally, Sherwin includes 12 (count `em, 12) Appendices in which  he discusses a wide range of subjects, beginning with \\"The 10-Second  Proposal\\" and concluding with \\"Additional Reading.\\" He also includes Notes  and a Glossary.<br />One benefit is derived from the process of thinking about  and then answering the 44 questions, especially for those preparing to  launch a new organization or for those associated with one now proceeding  through its launch phase. Sherwin suggests that \\"to win in the twenty-first  century\\", an organization must:<br />*  Select the right markets  *  Know its  customers<br />*  Design exceptional products<br />*  Market products  creatively<br />*  Distribute products efficiently<br />Answering the 44  questions will help any organization to meet these imperatives. Another  benefit is derived from the Appendices which I encourage the reader to  approach as if they were different departments within Sherwin's General  Store. Struggling to put together a business strategy presentation? Check  out aisle three. Need a marketing, sales, and distribution \\"scorecard\\"?  You'll find one over on aisle seven. You get the idea.

The venture capitalist asked  for his business card. \\"On the back of it, please explain why my firm  should invest in your idea.\\" Disbelief. \\"I can't possibly get it all down  on the back of a business card!\\" Pause. \\"Then I'm sorry but I really don't  think we have anything to talk about.\\" Years ago, a journalist asked  Katherine Hepburn to explain the success of her career. \\"Elimination.\\" She  had eliminated from her life everyone (including a husband with whom she  remained close friends) and everything which interfered with her career.  These two quite different situations illustrate, I think, the most  important point in Bill Jensen's book.<br />He asserts that simplicity is \\"the  new competitive advantage in a world of more, better, faster.\\" It is  certainly one of them. The book is divided into four sections:<br />The Aha  (which includes a discussion of Simplicity's \\"Evil Twin\\")<br />Simpler  WorkDays (eg using time, planning, contracting), <br />Simpler Companies (eg  \\"designing work for easy navigation\\")<br />Simpler FutureWork (ie \\"changing  how we structure companies\\")<br />Jensen concludes with an Epilogue in which  he discusses \\"The Power to Do What's Important.\\" I think this is a  carefully-reasoned, though-provoking, and eloquent book. <br />One important  point which some reviewers seem to have ignored is that Simplicity enables  us to cope much more effectively with Complexity. Think about all the  clutter you haul around in your mind; all the clutter piled up within your  workstation and probably on your computer's hard drive; all the clutter  your organization staggers and stumbles through each day. In any  competitive environment today, change is the only constant. As one result,  carefully crafted \\"long-range plans\\" can become irrelevant in a single day.  Organizations are comprised of people; people, by nature, love to collect  \\"stuff.\\" Lots of it. Many of our accumulations (including business  assumptions) no longer have value. Jensen correctly affirms the value of  the \\"KISS Principle\\" to how we think. He understands that our values and  perspectives generally determine how we behave. Obviously, it would be  Stupid to Keep Everything Simple. But surely it makes sense, \\"in a world of  infinite choices\\", to use Simplicity as a leadership tool to help us think  smarter. I highly recommend this book to those who are determined to do so.	2000-01-30

In the first, as a cultural anthropologist, he examines the creation and evolution of what has become one of the world's most fascinating communities. In the second, as a  journalist, he focuses on The Luxor to which he was given almost complete  access. We are thus provided with an abundance of historical information  which creates a frame-of-reference within which to examine virtually every  component of a single casino. In so saying, I do NOT in any way want to  suggest that Super Casino is in any sense dry, dull, etc. On the contrary,  it is a page-turner. There are so many colorful \\"characters\\" (\\"players\\"?)  portrayed, so many spell-binding plots and subplots, so many memorable  moments. We tag along with Earley as he observes and interacts with a  veritable \\"feast\\" of humanity and inhumanity. They're all here. Pioneers.  Con artists. Celebrity entertainers. Pinstriped Samurai. Mobsters.  Visionaries. Pimps and prostitutes. Bottom feeders. Victims. Victimizers.  Perhaps not since ancient Rome was most glorious and most decadent has  there been another community on this planet in which the best and worst  qualities of the human race have been more in evidence  than within the  gaming segment of Las Vegas.<br />Those who read this book may incorrectly  conclude that the Strip and Las Vegas are the same. They are not. It has  been my great privilege and pleasure to explore the metropolitan area and,  in terms of its (non-casino) business climate and quality of life, I would  rate it very highly. Indeed, superior to almost all other metropolitan  areas. But that is not the subject of Earley's book.<br />Who will most  enjoy reading it? My guess is that they would include those who have  already experienced Las Vegas and perhaps have asked \\"How did all this  happen? What really occurs behind the scene? What is the inside story on  all the changes which have occurred?\\" Also those who have never been to Las  Vegas but have seen the movies (eg Ocean's Eleven and Casino), have heard  about the antics of celebrities (eg Howard Hughes, Elvis, Sinatra and his  Rat Pack, Liberace, Wayne Newton), have read about the extravagances (Steve  Wynn's art collection), and ask \\"How much of this is true?

It is not a dictionary. It is not a sequential narrative. It is not an anthology of aphorisms or portions of previous publications. It is not a manual. (However, its title does make  much more sense than would those of other books such as Chicken Soup for  Dummies or Stan Laurel on Management.) What Leadership A to Z provides is  \\"a guide for the appropriately ambitious.\\" O'Toole believes that more can  be learned from what effective leaders do (and how they do it) than from  their personality and character. What do all effective leaders seem to have  in common? What O'Toole characterizes as \\"appropriate ambition.\\" Note the  modifier. All of us have ambitions. (The most effective leaders assuredly  do.) Within effective organizations, most of those involved seem to have  both personal and organizational ambitions which nourish and sustain each  other. At least these ambitions are not mutually-exclusive or even  incompatible. Within the most effective organizations, these ambitions are  almost (not quite) identical. Moreover, most of the time -- day to day --  most of those involved are leaders of leaders. That is, sharing ambitions  which are appropriate to them as well as to their organization, together  functioning as what Noel Tichy has described as a well-designed,  carefully-maintained \\"leadership engine.\\"<br />How should this book be read?  One option is to read it sequentially from A to Z. That will work. However,  my personal preference (and suggestion) is to re-visit the Contents (pages  ix-xi) whenever there is a question to be answered, a problem to be solved,  or a new perspective needed. You may find that the answer will reveal  itself after you read (let's say) some/all of B, H, J, and T; perhaps  reading some/all of A, M, R, and W will suggest a solution; as for gaining  a new perspective, I often hop around, in and out, back and forth.

In  fact, it is an excellent piece of work. He organizes most of the material  within ten \\"daily\\" segments. For those unwilling and/or unable to earn an  MBA degree but who wish to strengthen their business knowledge and skills,  I highly recommend this book. From my perspective, it provides at least  three major benefits:<br />First, the quality of writing is quite high:  Silbiger does NOT \\"talk down&quot; to his reader. Dim-wits and  knuckle-draggers will derive little (if any) benefit from this  book.<br />Second, as thoroughly as time and space allow, the material is  presented (exactly as promised) as a \\"step-by-step guide to mastering the  skills taught in America's top business schools.\\"<br />Third, however long it  takes to absorb and digest the information provided (ten days, ten weeks,  or ten months), the reader will  gain a sound working knowledge of subjects  which include marketing, ethics, accounting, organizational behavior,  quantitative analysis, finance, operations, economics, and strategy.  Silbiger also includes several \\"MBA Mini-Courses\\" and then brief  discussions of research, public speaking, negotiating, international  business, and business law.  In his Introduction, Silbiger observes: \\"My  goal is make you familiar with the significant MBA tools and theories  currently being taught at the leading business schools and to help you  understand and develop the MBA mind-set.\\"  He achieves his goal. Can this  book take the place of an MBA degree? Of course not. Can this book increase  substantially a reader's business knowledge and skills? You bet. It has  already done so for more than 200,000 readers and it will continue to do so  for many others in years to come.<br />If you decide to purchase this book,  take very seriously the learning opportunities it offers. (Why else buy  it?) Proceed with rigor and focus. Highlight key points and take notes  along the way, then review them at the conclusion of each \\"Day.\\" Stick to  the study schedule you deem most appropriate for you. Maintain a journal in  which you record your reactions and reflections as you learn. Perhaps one  day Silbiger will write a \\"Fieldbook\\" to accompany this one. Meanwhile, let  a journal become your own \\"Fieldbook.\\" Record in it your experiences when  applying what you have learned. In doing so, you may well create for  yourself a decisive advantage when competing with those who so proudly  possess an MBA degree from one of \\"America's top business schools.\\"ing opportunities it offers.

They do not advocate the total elimination of these  boundaries (which is impossible, anyway); rather,  they suggest how to  rearrange them so that an organization can thrive. For the authors, there  is what they call \\"A New World Order\\":<br /> &quot;In living organisms,  membranes exist to give the organization  shape and definition. They  have sufficient structural strength  to prevent the organism from  dissolving into an amorphous  mess....Like a living organism, the  boundaryless organization  also evolves and grows, and the placement of  boundaries may  shift....Because the boundaryless  organization is a living continuum,  not a fixed state, the  ongoing management challenge is to find the  right balance of  boundaryless behavior, to determine how permeable  to make boundaries,  and where to place them.&quot;<br />This brief excerpt from the first chapter  correctly suggests the purpose of this remarkable book: To explain HOW to  meet that challenge.<br />The material is presented within four parts plus a  conclusion. The first explains how to achieve \\"free movement up and down\\"  by crossing vertical boundaries; the second explains how to achieve \\"free  movement side to side\\" by crossing horizontal boundaries; the third  explains how to achieve \\"free movement along the value chain\\" by crossing  external boundaries; and in the fourth part, they explain how to achieve  \\"free global movement\\" by crossing geographic boundaries.\\" Then in the  Conclusion, the authors discuss \\"Making It Happen: Leading Toward the  Boundaryless Organization.\\"<br />The authors also include a series of six  questionnaires. By completing each in sequence, the reader is able to  determine (a) where her or his organization is now located relative to \\"the  boundaryless paradigm\\", and (b), what is needed to eliminate the \\"gap\\"  between where it is now and where it should be. Those who share my high  regard for this book are urged to read The Boundaryless Organization Field  Guide. It contains a a hands-on set of diagnostic instruments as well as  exercises and tools, and a disk with presentation slides in Powerpoint  format.<br />I agree with the authors: The most restrictive organizational  boundaries are in the minds of those within an organization. Organizational  as well as personal wounds are usually self-inflicted.mine (a) where her or his organization is now located relative to \\"the  boundaryless paradigm\\", and (b), what is needed to eliminate the \\"gap\\"  between where it is now and where it should be.

The reader is provided with an  abundance of insights from women who have \\"risen above life's challenges to  achieve extraordinary success.\\"<br />Wymard has a two-fold strategy: to  present within each of six chapters the experiences and insights of women  involved in a specific category (politics, policy, law, journalism,  business, and arts management); also, to correlate those experiences and  insights which are common to all of the categories. She succeeds  brilliantly.<br />Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book? First,  younger women who are encountering various barriers which are  gender-specific. (These barriers may be illegal but we all know that they  remain.) When my daughter entered the business world after graduating from  college, I wish I could have presented this book to her and said \\"Here is  an opportunity to eavesdrop on Ellie Wymard's conversations with 100  different successful women. Listen very carefully. You'll learn a great  deal from what they have to say about themselves and their  careers.\\"<br />Also, I think this book will be of great value to other women,  well into a career, who have become discouraged by these same barriers.  Perhaps motivation must come from within but I know from personal  experience that others can inspire us. After reading this book, many women  professionals will be inspired (in Tennyson's words) \\"to strive, to seek,  to find...and not to yield.\\"<br />Finally, I highly recommend this book to  other men who (a) share my contempt for the aforementioned barriers and are  determined to eliminate them completely, and/or (b) who are eager to learn  as much as they can from others who have \\"risen above life's challenges to  achieve extraordinary success.\\"<br />Thank you, Ellie Wymard, for the  pleasure of such uncommon company.cess.\\" <br />Thank you, Ellie Wymard, for the  pleasure of such uncommon company.	2000-01-20

Reiman is widely (and justly) renowned for his creative mind. Literally, he thinks for a living. And is paid handsomely for his creative talent. This  is an immensely personal book. He reviews his career, a career during which  he prospered as the head of his own advertising agency and then sold it to  his associates inorder to \\"solo\\" (as Harriet Rubin would describe it),  freeing himself from organizational limits to concentrate on what he does  best. \\"My occupation is thinker and that's who I am, employed at that.  Frankly, I can't wait until I get my new passport application. I'll get a  kick out of writing `Thinker' in the occupation section. After all, if I'm  right, thinkers will be going places in the next century.\\"<br />If you think  about it, think carefully about it, this is an intriguing idea: Come up  with terrific ideas and sell them for enormous sums of money. (That in  itself is a terrific idea.) In reality, obviously, there are very few  people who have the talent to \\"think for a living\\" as Reiman does. However,  and this is the single greatest value of the book, literally everyone CAN  learn from Reiman how to think more creatively in his or her career  situation...and to think more creatively about how to improve that  situation. Moreover, Reiman has some excellent insights into how to improve  one's mental and spiritual health. His values are unashamedly  old-fashioned. He seems totally committed to his marriage and parenthood.  He seems to have a deep and abiding faith in God. He clearly agrees with  Joseph Campbell who once said that \\"The privilege of a lifetime is to be  who you are.\\"<br />For the sake of discussion, let's assume that you are  unwilling and/or unable to make a total commitment to thinking as an  occupation. I mean full-time occupation. Nevertheless, Reiman explains how  his own experiences can help you to increase and enhance your creative (as  opposed to analytical) skills, how to apply them more effectively to the  personal as well as professional responsibilities entrusted to your care.  Reiman observes, \\"As intellectual capital becomes of greater value to  humankind than concrete capital, the world will experience dramatic  changes....The measurement of success will be based on one's ability to  create from within one's mind rather than outside. Idea rich will take the  place of asset rich.\\" I presume to add that ideas are now (or will soon  become) the most valuable of assets. That is what \\"I-commerce\\" is really  all about and it has only begun to have an impact.<br />Here is a brief,  revealing excerpt from the final chapter: \\"I hope this book, in some small  way, plays a role in helping to create the environment in which compassion  and prayer, wisdom and kindness, humility and grace become the most  powerful, unstoppable big ideas for the next century. If they do, thinking  for a living, in the broadest sense of thinking for a rich life, will  enrich us all.\\"o analytical) skills, how to apply them more effectively to the  personal as well as professional responsibilities entrusted to your care.

Its basic premise is that \\"intelligence is too important to be left to the intelligence testers.\\" Gardner notes that, during the past half century, many  assumptions about the human mind and the human brain have been  challenged...in some instances revised. \\"For example, we now understand  that the human mind, reflecting the structure of the brain, is composed of  modules or faculties. At the same time, in light of scientific and  technological changes, the needs and desires of cultures all over the world  have undergone equally dramatic shifts.\\" The task Gardner sets for himself,  therefore, is to introduce and then explain his theory of multiple  intelligences (MI) in juxtaposition with the traditional view of  intelligence.<br />After describing the traditional view of intelligence in  Chapter 2, he next considers several \\"new candidate intelligences\\"  (naturalist, spiritual, existential, and moral). In the remaining chapters,  he addresses questions and criticisms about his theory; dispels some of the  more prominent myths; explores the relationships among intelligence,  creativity, and leadership;  suggests how his theory can be applied;  discusses the theory in scholastic settings, then in\\"the wider world\\"; and  then in the final chapter, explores in greater depth (returning to issues  raised in Chapter 1) \\"my answer to the provocative question, \\"Who owns  intelligence?'\\"<br />Gardner \\"reframes\\" our understanding of human  intelligence by increasing the number and nature of our perspectives on it.  That is to say, he creates a wider, deeper, and more diverse  frame-of-reference in which certain conclusions which, for many apparently,  are controversial. For example, \\"the saga of individual consciousness  cannot be reduced to formulas or generalizations.\\" Moreover, \\"no two  selves, no two consciousnesses, no two minds are exactly alike.\\" Therefore,  \\"Each of is...is situated to make a unique contribution to the world.\\" The  challenge for the human race is to discover \\"our deepest common tie -- that  we are all joint products of natural and cultural evolution.\\"<br />I am  reminded of what Walt Whitman once said: \\"Do I contradict myself? Very  well, then, I contradict myself. I am large. I contain multitudes.\\" Gardner  seems to be suggesting that, if each human being contains \\"multitudes\\", it  is imperative that we cherish as well as recognize such diversity and  complexity. Only then can we \\"in a complementary but synergistic way\\"  ensure \\"that Nature and Culture survive for future generations.\\" For all of  us, Gardner's theory has profound implications. It also suggests  substantial benefits if we apply this theory within what is sometimes  referred to as \\"The Family of Man.\\"the world.\\" The  challenge for the human race is to discover \\"our deepest common tie -- that  we are all joint products of natural and cultural evolution.\\"<br />I am  reminded of what Walt Whitman once said: \\"Do I contradict myself?

Here are three: Goman provides an in-depth analysis of HOW various high-tech companies are creating a decisive competitive advantage for themselves by attracting and  keeping superior talent; she explains HOW virtually all other organizations  (including companies) can do so also; finally, she explains why companies  such as Lotus, Cisco Systems, Autodesk, i2 Technologies, and PeopleSoft are  \\"still in the process of evolving.\\" Their individual efforts merely  comprise a \\"beginning.\\" She concludes that \\"...each company, with each  experiment it undertakes, adds another building block lesson learned to the  collective evolutionary process.\\" It is commendable for Goman to provide so  much valuable information and commentary. It is also commendable that she  includes a caution that, in the immortal words of Paul Williams, \\"We've  only just begun.\\"<br />Various \\"lessons\\" to be learned from \\"the technology  frontier\\" are carefully organized and then developed. In Chapter 1, for  example, Goman lists what she calls \\"The Eight Commandments of High-Tech  Culture\\": 1. Egalitarianism, 2. Freedom, 3. Informality, 4. Trust, 5.  Responsibility, 6. Teamwork, 7. High Performance, and 8. Fun. The challenge  is to optimize all eight in the most appropriate balance. She concludes the  chapter with the first of several lists of Lessons\\" which will inform  efforts to meet that challenge.<br />For me, one of the most valuable  chapters is Chapter 6: \\"Thriving on Change, Complexity, and Chaos.\\" In it,  Goman analyzes how and why several companies have succeeded amidst the  \\"extreme volatility\\" of continuous restructuring by accepting \\"constant  adaptation to new situations as a fundamental of survival and prosperity.\\"  At the end of this chapter, Goman provides another series of  \\"Lessons\\"  which are eminently sensible.<br />Goman agrees with Debra Engel (former head  of HR at 3Com) that it took four hundred years for business organizations  to operate successfully in the Industrial Age. \\"We are only beginning to  understand how to operate in the &quot;Information Age.\\" In essence, that  is the challenge which Goman's brilliant book addresses with eloquence as  well as insight. I agree with her that \\"organizations don't change. People  do -- or they don't.\\" If all this seems relevant to you, I urge you to buy  this book, read it carefully, and then review (at least every month or two)  the various lists of \\"Lessons.\\" If you are determined to be a change agent  in your own organization and it refuses to support your efforts, I presume  to suggest that you find another which will.organizations  to operate successfully in the Industrial Age. \\"We are only beginning to  understand how to operate in the &quot;Information Age.\\" In essence, that  is the challenge which Goman's brilliant book addresses with eloquence as  well as insight.

I really enjoyed reading this book. It traces the emergence of Wall Street as a world power from 1653 until 2000. In Chapter One, Gordon takes us back in time to the colony of Nieuw Amsterdam. Because its governor, Peter  Stuyvesant, feared a land attack from New England, he convinced local  merchants to finance the construction of a wall on the town's northern  edge. After its construction (of sixteen-foot logs sunk four feet into the  ground and sharpened at the top), the city council initially refused to  repay the merchants. Only later when Stuyvesant agreed to turn over  revenues from the tax on liquor in compensation did the council reluctantly  agree. Thus did the town gain a new wall...and a new street as well.<br />This situation is representative of Gordon's approach to more than 300  years of history. He anchors his reader in a series of historical  situations which can often seem dry as dust. Presented by Gordon, they  almost come to life. Consider this brief excerpt:<br /> [My book] runs  from an economy powered by peasants at  their plows to one powered by  office workers at their computers;  from Galileo's handmade  two-inch telescope that could not clearly  make out the rings of  Saturn, to the Keck Observatory's paired-ten-  meter instruments  that can see twelve billion light years into space;  from a world  where news moved at the speed of a horse to one  where it moves at  the speed of light;. Thus this book is history on the  grand scale. And  history on such a scale of necessity, largely the  history of  great men, great themes, and great powers.<br />As Gordon also notes in the  Prologue, like ancient Rome, \\"Wall Street started small and  inconsequential, utterly unnoticed by the mighty of the earth....And like  the story of Rome, Wall Street's story is a story worth telling. For like  the Romans, the players  of the great game were (and are) great, petty,  loathsome, smart, brainless, selfish, generous, and always, always human.\\"<br />There are 15 lively chapters and then an Epilogue in which Gordon  describes playing \\"the great game\\" as \\"pursuing our infinite self-interests  within the rules of the game.\\" By doing so, \\"we will continue to move the  invisible hand that has made so much of the world so rich.\\" Frankly, I was  at first reluctant to read this book. However, I immediately became  fascinated by what Gordon shares in the Prologue and then totally caught up  in the narrative which follows. Having read it, I understood what Edwin  Lefevre (whom Gordon quotes) meant when he once said of that financial  center: \\"The game does not change and neither does human nature.\\"/>There are 15 lively chapters and then an Epilogue in which Gordon  describes playing \\"the great game\\" as \\"pursuing our infinite self-interests  within the rules of the game.\\" By doing so, \\"we will continue to move the  invisible hand that has made so much of the world so rich.\\" Frankly, I was  at first reluctant to read this book.

Chancellor provides such a framework and more...much more. In the the initial chapter (\\"The  Bubble World\\"), he explains the origins of financial speculation and then  shifts his attention to a series of famous (sometimes infamous) situations  throughout three centuries. As Chancellor explains, \\"I concentrate on  occurrences of speculation in the leading economic powers of the day, from  the Dutch Republic in the seventeenth century to Japan in the 1980s,  interspersed with the occasional look at speculation in the present day. I  believe that speculation can only be understood within a social context and  that a history of speculation cannot simply be a description of economic  affairs but must also be something of a social history.\\" Joel Mokyr has a  similar objective in The Lever of Riches in which he examines various  interrelationships between technological creativity and economic progress  since classical antiquity. Both he and Chancellor present  information and develop their ideas within what could be called an \\"historical  infrastructure.\\" They succeed admirably.<br /><br />In Chapter 7, as Chancellor  concludes his examination of \\"The Gilded Age\\", he quotes the American  economist H.C. Emory who wrote that \\"whereas gambling consists in placing  money on artificially created risks of some fortuitous event, speculation  consists in assuming the inevitable risks of changes in value.\\" For  Chancellor, speculation in the late-nineteenth century \\"brought more harm  than good and transferred property from the hands of the many into the  pockets of the few.\\" This is also a useful perspective on the subsequent  \\"Crash\\" of 1929 and thereafter, a volatile period which Chancellor also  analyzes with eloquence as well as insight.<br /><br />It is an even more useful  perspective on the economy of a country such as Russia in the early-21st  century. As Chancellor correctly points out in the Epilogue, \\"The issue of  speculation in emerging markets and the unfettered trade in foreign currencies is the most immediate and vexing problem faced by policymakers.\\"  For me, Devil Take the Hindmost is an absolutely indispensable guide to  more than three centuries of stock market speculation. He focuses on a  broad range of speculators (eg Del Defoe, Benjamin Disraeli, Jay Gould,  Ivan Boesky, Michael Milken, and Hilary Rodham Clinton); in process, he  suggests that the primary motives which drive these and other speculators  are far more complicated than many of us (I at least) had assumed...and, as  often as not, these morives reflect \\"the national character\\" of the country  in which a speculator  succeeds or fails.ancellor correctly points out in the Epilogue, \\"The issue of  speculation in emerging markets and the unfettered trade in foreign currencies is the most immediate and vexing problem faced by policymakers.\\"  For me, Devil Take the Hindmost is an absolutely indispensable guide to  more than three centuries of stock market speculation.

He urges his  reader to absorb and digest the contents of Leadership in High-Performance  Organizational Cultures with care, of course, but also with some degree of  critical detachment. Then, correlate his observations and suggestions with  the specific circumstances of the reader's own organization.<br />Truskie  suggests that \\"there is a direct link between  leadership, organizational  culture, and performance.\\" According to his research and analysis, the most  effective leader has an impact on \\"forming the culture of an organization,  which further can have an enhancing effect of improving the level, ensuring  the consistency, and sustaining the organization's continuing performance  improvement.\\" Truskie believes that many leaders are preoccupied with  identifying and then manifesting an \\"ideal\\" style of leadership when, in  fact, no such style exists. That is to say, even the most effective leaders  have significant human imperfections; however, they are aware of these  imperfections and make every effort to ensure that these imperfections do  not have a negative impact on their respective organizations.<br />For this  reader, one of the greatest benefits of Leadership in High-Performance  Organizational Cultures is Truskie's explanation of the potential,  beneficial implications of the L4 Strategy with specific relevance to  creating and then sustaining a high-performance organizational culture.  Leaders as well as those whom they lead must constantly monitor the balance  of four aforementioned cultural patterns. Imbalances are inevitable.  Although Truskie does not discuss it, he would probably agree that an  early-warning system of some kind is highly desirable. The model he  provides suggests all manner of ways by which to recognize and then respond  effectively to symptoms of such imbalances. For the foreseeable future,  change will be the only constant. Given that reality, Leadership in  High-Performance Organizational Cultures can be of even greater value as  all organizations (regardless of their size or nature) proceed into an  otherwise uncertain future.rovides suggests all manner of ways by which to recognize and then respond  effectively to symptoms of such imbalances.

There is no try.\\" Paradoxically, Microsoft's emphasis on performance  (eg dominance of a market) co-exists with Microsoft's requirement of  calculated risks because, as Thielen explains, \\"Fast failure is acceptable;  slow failure is not. But even more unacceptable is no failure. If people  never fail, then they are not trying hard enough. They are not pushing the  envelope....There is no penalty for understandable failures on the road to  success (aside from exceedingly stupid things), and there are substantial  rewards for success. So employees at Microsoft will make attempt after  attempt for success without worrying about the failures the unsuccessful  attempts led to.\\" But not indefinitely....<br />Throughout The 12 Simple  Secrets of Microsoft Management, Thielen provides hundreds of specific  examples of HOW these so-called \\"secrets\\" are consistently applied each and  every day throughout the entire company. At least in theory,  the Microsoft  management strategies (with appropriate modifications) can be effective for  any other organization, regardless of size or nature. For example, a  family-owned dry cleaner experiments with several different coupon  promotions until it finally comes up with one that substantially increases  business. Past \\"failures\\" are often a necessary cost of eventual success.  However, I caution those interested in this book to keep in mind that  listing and then explaining 7-75 &quot;secrets&quot; is relatively easy;  implementing them effectively and then remaining committed to them is  (obviously) much more difficult. My own experience suggests that such a  commitment should continue unless and until certain realities require the  modification or even the replacement of a strategy. The corporate  juggernaut we know as Microsoft is in a process of constant  self-transformation. The same should also be true of that hypothetical  family-owned dry cleaner.ame should also be true of that hypothetical  family-owned dry cleaner.	2000-01-12

Throughout his brilliant book, he correlates  technological creativity with economic progress throughout classical  antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Industrial Revolution, and  then into the later 19th century.<br />In Chapter 12 (\\"Epilogue\\"), he further  develops what is assuredly an invaluable  frame-of-reference within which  to understand our own time. Why does technological creativity occur? There  are two components in the invention-innovation sequence: \\"technical  problems involve a struggle between mind and matter, that is, they involve  control of the physical environment.\\" The other component is social: \\"For a  new technique to be implemented, the innovator has to react with a human  environment comprised of competitors, customers, suppliers, the  authorities, neighbors, possibly the priest.\\"<br />This brief commentary has  only inadequately suggested the scope and depth of Mokyr's rigorous inquiry  into technological creativity and its contributions to economic progress.  In weeks and months to come, there will be new \\"levers\\" which help to  create new \\"riches.\\" The historical context within which Joel Mokyr places  these opportunities is a contribution of incalculable value.	2000-01-12

Actually, a great deal. The book is Hidden Champions and ts author is Hermann Simon. He explains that his book  &quot;reveals the secrets of success of the best of the best unknown  companies.\\" They are unknown, for the most part, because that's the way  they want it. They \\"relish their obscurity. They shy away from publicity,  some through explicit policies of not dealing with the press --or, by the  way, with academic researchers!\\" such as the author. Simon selected them  according to three criteria: They must be #1 or #2 in a world market or in  their European market; they must be small-to-midsize; and they must have  low public visibility.<br />In Chapter 11, the final chapter, Simon carefully  reviews various \\"lessons\\" which can be learned from \\"hidden champions.\\" He  categorizes them as follows: Lessons for Large Corporations, Lessons for  Champion Corporations, Lessons for Diversified Corporations, Lessons for  Small Companies, Lessons for Investors, and General Qualitative Lessons. He  concludes: \\"The hidden champions go their own ways. Their procedures are  quite different from those of other companies and of modern management  teaching. Essentially, their only secret success formula is common sense.  So simple, but so difficult to achieve! This is the ultimate lesson.\\"<br />Simon is to be commended for drawing attention to &quot;champions&quot;  who know who and where they are...even if we didn't until now. His book is  well-written, the content is substantial, and the lessons to be learned  from these &quot;champions&quot; have immense potential value. However, as  Coach Darrell Royal once observed, &quot;potential&quot; means &quot;you  ain't done it yet.&quot;ÿ	2000-01-12

Edelman accomplishes what seems to be an almost impossible task: He helps the non-scientist to understand the connections between what is known about the mind with what is beginning  to be known about the brain. For Edelman, this subject \\"is the most  important one imaginable\\" because it is charged \\"with the excitement of  being on the threshold of knowing how we know.\\" At the outset, he poses  \\"some commonsense notions\\":<br />1.  Things do not have minds.<br />2.  Normal  humans have minds; some animals act as if they do.<br />3.  Beings with minds  can refer to other beings or things; things without minds  do not  refer to beings or things.<br />The book is divided into four main parts  (Problems, Origins, Proposals, and Harmonies), concluding with \\"Mind  Without Biology: A Critical Postscript\\" in which Edelman dispels the notion  that the mind can be understood in the absence of biology. Stated another  way (in Chapter 2), \\"There must be ways to put the mind back into nature  that are concordant with how it got there in the first place.\\"<br />Obviously,  this is not a book for browsers, for grasshoppers, or for dilettantes. It  makes great demands on the mind (and patience) of its reader. But consider  Edelman's original objective: to explore the connections between what is  known about the mind with what is beginning to be known about the brain.

In the Introduction, however, he  makes it crystal clear that open-book management is NOT a panacea, is NOT a  substitute for TQM or reengineering or any other operational overhaul, and  is NOT a single system. In essence, open-book management helps companies to  create a shared environment in which everyone understands that they are  competing in a marketplace, trying to make money. But for whom? Frequently,  effective ownership has been limited to relatively few people. In  privately-held companies, usually to a single person and/or to a family.  Presumably Case agrees with Al Ehrbar (author of EVA) that the traditional  concept of \\"ownership\\" must be re-defined so that everyone involved in a  given enterprise assumes personal responsibility for adding value. Hence  the importance of recognition of peak performance but also the importance  of financial incentives. \\"What's in it for me?\\" is a quite legitimate  question. Given the increasingly greater impact of globalization, the  information revolution, and what Case calls \\"entrepreneuralization\\",  companies must find new and better ways to answer that question. For Case,  each company needs a mission, a strategy. \\"But more than anything else it  needs eager, willing employees, people who have a reason to care about  their employer's prosperity and who know how to help it  succeed.\\"<br />Ultimately, the measurable value of open-book principles will  be determined by several factors: The extent to which a company modifies  them to accommodate its own circumstances; the extent to which employees in  that company (top to bottom) commit to the program, once devised; and the  extent to which everyone involved shares equitably (NOT equally) in the  rewards.<br />Those who admire this book as much as I do will presumably want  to read (if they have not already read) The Open-Book Field Book and The  Open-Book Experience. These two books develop in much greater detail the  material first introduced in Open-Book Management. Also, they provide an  absolutely essential guide to deriving maximum benefit from John Case's  wisdom and experience.if they have not already read) The Open-Book Field Book and The  Open-Book Experience.

Christensen makes his objective crystal clear: \\"This book is about the failure of companies to stay atop their industries when they confront certain types of market and technological  change....the good companies -- the kinds that many managers have admired  for years and tried to emulate, the companies known for their abilities to  innovate and execute....It is about well-managed companies that have their  competitive antennae up, listen astutely to their customers....invest  aggressively in new technologies, and yet they still lose market  dominance.\\" Why? For Christensen, the answer is revealed in what he calls  \\"the innovator's dilemma\\": the logical, competent decisions of management  which are critical to the success of their companies are also the reasons  why they lose their positions of leadership.<br />In the current and imminent  global marketplace, paradox has become paradigm.<br />Managers in every  organization (regardless of size or nature) eventually must resolve \\"the  innovator's dilemma.\\" Christensen's book provides invaluable assistance to  completing that immensely difficult process. It remains for each of his  readers to answer questions such as these: Which customers do we want?  (also, which customers do we NOT want?) Which technologies will help us to  get and then keep them? For each technology, which strategies will be most  effective to sustain it? Should we attack competitors with disruptive  technology? How can we best defend ourselves against it? How should our  resources be allocated? What about timing? Should we lead or follow? If we  follow, should we prepare to lead later? Correct (ie appropriate) answers  to questions such as these will help to clarify today's realities and to  suggest strategies for an uncertain future.<br />My own suspicion is that  there will always be another dilemma to resolve. Christensen suggests a  rigorous process by which to do so.	2000-01-12

In between, Gross and his  associates also examine other great leaders such as McCormick, Rockefeller,  Morgan, Ford, Merrill, Sarnoff, Disney, Johnson, Ogilvy, Kroc, Wilson, Ash,  Walton, and McGowan as well as major corporations such as American Express,  Intel, Harley-Davidson, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.

For Morris, essentially the economic  survival of thirteen colonies during their struggle for independence. For  McCormick, the industrialization of agriculture. For Rockefeller, the  creation and development of the modern corporation. For Morgan, saving a  nation's financial system. For Ford, mass-producing affordable personal  transportation.

Second, leaders who develop other leaders  have teachable points of view in the specific areas of ideas, values, and  something I call E-cubed -- emotional energy and edge....Third, leaders  embody their teachable points of view in living stories....Finally, because  winning leaders invest considerable time developing other leaders, they  have well-defined methodologies and coaching and teaching techniques.\\"  Together, these \\"fundamentals\\" create the central metaphor in the book: a  machine.<br />As a \\"machine\\", an organization consists of separate but  interdependent parts; requires lubrication and fuel as well as constant  maintenance; and functions best when utilized to serve the specific  purposes for which it has been designed.Almost half of  The Leadership  Engine consists of a \\"Handbook for Leaders Developing Leaders.\\" In it, the  authors provide a cohesive and comprehensive answer to the question \\"How to  create a Leadership Engine?\\" One useful approach to the \\"Handbook\\" is to  think of it as a \\"super\\" hardware store and you have an empty toolbox.

In Organizing Genius: The Secrets of Creative Collaboration,  he and Patricia Ward Biederman examine a number of what the authors call  \\"Great Groups.\\" Perhaps the most important point is introduced in the first  chapter: \\"None of us is as smart as all of us.\\"<br />That is to say, the  \\"Great Man\\" theory is invalidated by the achievements of truly creative  teams such as those at the Disney studios which produced so many animation  classics; at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) which developed the  first personal computer; at Apple Computer which then took it to market; in  the so-called \\"War Room\\" which helped to elect Bill Clinton President in  1992; at the so-called \\"Skunk Works\\" where so many of Lockheed's greatest  designs were formulated; at Black Mountain College which \\"wasn't simply a  place where creative collaboration took place.

Most of  us have been \\"stone-walled\\" at some point in our careers. Or perhaps we  have on occasion felt that we have hit a \\"brick wall.\\" Encountering a  \\"glass ceiling\\" is far worse because we can see through the glass to what  lies beyond...to what we are denied. I am reminded of Tantalus who,  according to Greek mythology, offended the gods. His punishment was to  remain in Hades for eternity, thirsty and hungry, placed up to his neck in  water he could not drink beneath clusters of fruit he could not eat: So  near and yet so far.<br />It is Pamela Boucher Gilberd's assertion that  \\"Women's economic creativity is one of the best-kept secrets in business  today....It's time to acknowledge the truth -- that working women have the  tools to create wild success for themselves and others and that we use  those tools every day.\\" Written in 1996, The Eleven Commandments of Wildly  Successful Women is based on 125 interviews with a wide-range of women who  have achieved \\"wild success.\\" Their collective experiences suggest eleven  &quot;commandments\\" which Gilberd introduces and then illustrates by  cross-referencing the experiences and insights of those she interviewed.  The final chapter is perhaps the most valuable. In it, she shares Angi Ma  Wong's 15 \\"Golden Rules for a Successful Life\\" and then her own 10 \\"Ways to  Keep the Cycle of Success Going Strong.\\"<br />Since 1996 when this book was  first published, many organizations have raised the so-called \\"glass  ceiling\\" and I guess that's progress.

Many organizations do little (if anything) to protect their most valuable information. I don't know why. The first objective of  Confidential is to explain what an effective intelligence gathering system is and does. The  second objective is to explain how companies can effectively protect the  intelligence they possess. Drawing upon more than twenty years of extensive  prior experience in intelligence and counterintelligence, Nolan offers a  number of \\"tools\\" and \\"techniques\\" from which to select those most  appropriate. (He even helps with the selection process.) Perhaps the best  place to begin is to complete what he calls an \\"intelligence audit.\\" It  consists of two different clusters of basic questions:<br />  First: What  do we need to know? Why? What do we need to know that we do not  as yet know? How and from which sources can we obtain what we  lack? Finally, what are our strategic objectives? For example, what  kinds of intelligence will we probably need within the next 12-18  months? Why?<br /> Then: What does our own intelligence consist of? How  is it organized? Which of it is most valuable? Why? From whom should our  most valuable  intelligence be protected? How?<br />The \\"good  news\\" is that any organization can (with appropriate modifications)  implement a system based on Nolan's Integrated Business Intelligence Model.  The \\"bad news\\" is that any organization lacking such a system remains  vulnerable to adversaries who have such a system in place. Organizations  claim that their \\"most valuable assets walk out the door at the end of each  day.\\" As Nolan explains in Confidential, the implications of that statement  often involve much more than generally realized. Stated bluntly, those  &quot;most valuable assets&quot; could well include proprietary information  which should not be removed (usually having been  photcopied) at the end of  a business day.<br />One final point: Nothing which Nolan recommends is  either illegal or unethical. Indeed, most organizations make it so easy for  competitors to obtain the information desired that there is no need for  illegal or unethical initiatives. Purchase this book, follow its advice,  and thereby enable your organizatoion to obtain the information it needs  while protecting from its comnpetitors the information they would love to  have.

Within each of the four parts, Kawasaki includes interviews  with various corporate executives who share their real-world experiences.  He offers hundreds of examples to illustrate his ideas about non-conformist  strategies which will help achieve a competitive advantage.<br />In his more  recent book, Rules for Revolutionaries, Kawasaki asserts that, inorder to  break down the barriers to innovation, one must \\"command like a king.\\" That  is to say, have steadfast convictions and then communicate those  convictions to others with the power of faith and self-assurance. When  asked to explain what a champion is, Jack Dempsey replied that a champion  \\"gets up when he can't.\\" Such determination is admirable, of course, but  not always prudent. (What if David had decided to wrestle Goliath?)  Agreeing with Jeffrey Gitomer, Kawasaki insists that customers must become  \\"evangelists\\", not merely buyers of whatever one sells. Sustainable  customer loyalty is the objective, not satisfaction with a single  transaction. The same is true when one must generate support to overcome  resistance to change. Two mistakes must be avoided: in Barbara Tuchman's  words, \\"assessing a situation in terms of preconceived fixed notions while  ignoring or rejecting contrary signs\\", and, \\"the refusal to benefit from  experience.\\" Only by being alert to \\"contrary signs\\" while benefiting from  experience can anyone hope to prevail.<br />Kawasaki has sometimes been  described as &quot;controversial&quot;, usually by those who feel obliged  to defend the status quo. Kawasaki challenges all assumptions and premises  (including his own), convinced that  agility, mobility, and hostility are  essential to success in the competitive marketplace.

They are often confused about the world of investing. Because they are busy people, they are frequently short of time. Many rely primarily on indexing. Others have just begun their investment journey. They pay too much in  taxes. They are concerned about pre-retirement investing. Or they are  retired and fear that they will outlive their money. They may be concerned  about financing the education of children or grandchildren. &quot;Is there  an investment strategy which will produce great returns over the long-term  cycle of bull and bear markets?&quot; Huguet asked himself this question  and then began rigorous and extensive research to answer it. Great  Companies, Great Returns  is the result of his research.<br />Essentially,  Huguet concluded that there are certain stocks which every investor should  own. Which stocks? He next concluded that there are a few great American  companies in which to invest, companies whose stocks will produce  outstanding, tax-efficient returns in a variety of market conditions. OK  but which Great Companies? He identifies and then explains his selections.<br />The strategy which Huguet advocates makes compelling sense for those  whose long-term investment objectives are to maximize returns while  minimizing risks and taxes, and thereby achieving the greatest returns  (over time) from publicly-traded stocks. Large-cap companies really do have  significant strategic advantages over their smaller-cap counterparts. Of  these, Huguet has selected only 14. If a reader of  Great Companies, Great  Returns has a better combination of traits and/or a better selection of  Great Companies in which to invest, Huguet would be delighted to know. (So  would I.)<br />I rate his book  so highly for two reasons: Huguet's rationale for long-term investment is  sound, and, while explaining his reasons for it, he provides a brilliant  analysis of the companies in which he believes such an investment should be  made. My guess is that this book will be most valuable to those who need  both the rationale and the research in support of it.provides a brilliant  analysis of the companies in which he believes such an investment should be  made.

Some of what  intelligence encompasses are cleverness, foresight,, speed, creativity, and  how many things you can juggle at once.\\"<br />Although Calvin is an eminent  theoretical neurophysiologist, How Brains Think is not a textbook in which  he explains in mind-numbing detail the brain, the mind, and their  interaction. Calvin has written How Brains Think for the reasonably  intelligent non-scientist. As Calvin concludes How Brains Think, he  observes:<br /> It behooves us to be a considerate creator [of  superintelligent machines],  wise to the world and its fragile nature,  sensitive to the need for stable  footings that will prevent  backsliding -- and keep the house of cards  we call civilization from  collapsing.<br />Near the end of his book, Calvin quotes from Lewis Thomas'  masterpiece The Medusa and the Snail: \\"We need science, more and better  science, not for its technology, not for its leisure, not even for health  and longevity, but for the hope of wisdom which our kind of culture must  acquire for its survival.\\" Albert Borgmann, Eric Drexler, Thomas Friedman,  and Joel Mokyr (among others) rise to their feet to join William Calvin in  applauding Thomas' comments.<br />If intelligence is \\"what you use when you  don't know what to do\\", then \\"more and better science\\" must help to provide  the \\"wisdom\\" of knowing precisely what to do...and what not to do. That's  how brains should think. And will, Calvin believes,  but if only we have  courage and determination sufficient to the task.<br />Calvin helps an  interested layman (at least this one) to understand a rather complicated  body of phenomena...doing so with style, grace, and wit. This is a book I  re-read at least twice a year. Are Calvin's ideas that stimulating?

He then makes several distinctions which serve to organize the book into three  separate but related parts: Natural Information: Information about Reality,  Cultural Information: Information for Reality, and Technological  Information: Information as Reality<br />What is Borgmann's ultimate  objective? In his own words, \\"we need both a theory and an ethics of  information -- a theory to illuminate the structure of information and an  ethics to get the moral of its development.\\" To achieve this objective, he  creates a frame of reference within which to understand the evolution of  \\"information\\" from primeval times when it served to disclose distant  reality until now when it frequently seems to have a reality wholly apart  from the actual world.<br />The importance of  Holding On to Reality is  perhaps most evident in its Conclusion when Borgmann invites his reader to  reflect upon \\"The Lightness of Being\\" and \\"Adjusting the Balance\\" while  hiking with him across his beloved Montana. Obviously, Borgmann struggles  to hold on to the reality of his own world. With passion as well as  eloquence and erudition, he inspires his readers to do so with theirs.	2000-01-11

I was eager to read this biography because I have seen most of the films directed by John Ford and was interested in knowing more about &quot;his life and times.&quot; I learned a great deal. Eyman provides a wealth of information. However, given Richard Schickel's observation that Ford was a director who &quot;delighted in in cruelty, publicly humiliating his casts and crews, a man who carried petty grudges for punishing decades and someone whose wihdrawals and silences profoundly damaged his family,&quot; I had hoped that Eyman would explain the reasons for so many of Ford's failed human relationships. Perhaps the title of one of my favorite Ford films -- They Were Expendable -- suggests one of them. Does Eyman agree with Schickel? Even if he does, he fails to reveal in this otherwise solid biography what Schickel calls &quot;the complicated truth&quot; about John Ford.	2000-01-09

Swiss duly acknowledges that many of these  barriers are unintentional. In this instance, the problem presumably is one  of ignorance. OK, but we all know that there are many in the work  environment (intimidated females as well as self-serving males) who are  well aware of these barriers and either tolerate them or defend them. In  this instance, the problem is one of attitude. Whatever, many barriers are  illegal; the remaining barriers are  dumb (because precious human assets  are underutilized) and/or punitive (because someone feels threatened). The  300 women who are &quot;on the leading edge of change&quot; are to be  commended for their achievement. But let's not lose sight of a key point:  Most (if not all) of them should not have had to experience the resistance,  at times the hostility and perhaps even the abuse, they did.<br />This book  (published in 1996) is based on the results of a survey in which 300 women  participated. When &quot;Taking Stock&quot;, Swiss shares several facts  about women at work, at least in 1996:<br />*  The salary gap mirrors the  gender gap.<br />*  Moving women into the managerial pipeline has done little  to advance deserving ones into senior management.<br />*  Gender, not talent,  is often the deciding factor in who is offered committee leadership or the  golden client.<br />*  Progressive policies on paper are meaningless in the  absence of support from top management and line supervisors.<br />*  Sexual  harassment continues to be a silent partner in maintaining an unsupportive  work enviroment for women.<br />*  Gender bias, not parenting  responsibilities, is the factor most likely to slow a woman's  advancement.<br />Granted, since 1996, there has been substantial improvement  in at least some of these areas and men in the workplace deserve at least a  portion of the credit. However, there should be zero tolerance of any  illegal or inappropriate behavior in the work environment. Period. During  the course of Women Breaking Through, Swiss focuses on &quot;10 obstacles  at work.&quot; Based on the results from the survey, she offers equally  specific suggestions as to how to eliminate those barriers.<br />At some  point, hopefully very soon, there will no longer be a need for a book such  as this. But our society is nowhere near that point yet. There have been so  many important technological  &quot;break-throughs&quot; in the business  world just within the past few years, most notably the WWW. If we can  develop highly sophisticated machines, why can't we also develop highly  sophisticated people for whom the behavior Swiss and others have cited is  unconscionable?

For me, there are certain books which convey me (as if on a magic carpet) to worlds I could not othgerwise experience. The novels of Tolstoy, Dickens, Balzac, and Joyce,  for example. For years, I have wondered about the face in the series of  self-portraits painted by Rembrandt.  Those eyes, especially the eyes. Many  have found fault with this book, questioning its reliability as a  biography, as a cultural history, as an analysis of one of the world's  greatest painters. I am unqualified to address those criticisms. But I can  share with others my sense of delight and wonder as I experienced (albeit  vicariously) the world which Rembrandt portrayed and in which he lived. Is  that portrayal wholly accurate? I have no idea. With exceptional skill,  Schama has transported me back in time...through Rembrandt's  paintings...to a world, indeed a universe, I could not otherwise visit.  During that journey, my soul as well as my mind was nourished...and my eyes  now see with even greater wonder and delight the world in which I live.	2000-01-07

Hopefully, reviews by readers such as I suggest which are worthy of consideration. Recently published Net Ready is among those I rate  highest. It is a virtual (no pun intended) textbook for those in need of an  intellectual framework within which to formulate strategies and tactics to  maximize the effectiveness of their Internet-based operations. The authors  focus on \\"six key areas\\": customers, globalization, partnerships,  employees, culture, and access. \\"Net Readiness\\" depends upon four  components (also referred to as \\"properties\\" and \\"pillars\\") which must be  developed and integrated within these areas: leadership, governance,  competencies, and technology. Hundreds of specific real-world situations  are used to illustrate the components, each of which is analyzed in detail.  The authors also include specific suggestions to assist the completion and  implementation of a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective  plan.<br />Here is how Net Ready is organized:<br />Part I  Strategies for  Success in the E-conomy<br />Part II  Techniques for Creating  Sustainable<br />Part III  Net Readiness to Realities<br />Appendix A:  Net Readiness  E-Business Planning Audit<br />Appendix B: Comprehensive  Net Readiness Scorecard<br />It's all here: Rock-solid content presented with  a crisp and lucent writing style. In the first chapter of Part I, for  example, the authors suggest that Net Proficiency in technology requires  organizations to adhere to the following principles:<br />*  Ability to build  and drive standards across the enterprise.<br />*  Demonstrated  scalability.<br />*  Business-driven technological strategy.<br />*  Insistence  on simplicity.<br />*  Human resources that are aligned with business  goals.<br />*  A mature build versus buy model.<br />This is only one of many  checklists throughout Net Ready which enable the reader to organize  information, formulate solid concepts, develop strategies and tactics, and  then take appropriate action with (in the authors' words) \\"ruthless  execution.\\" Although most of the companies discussed in Net Ready are large  and complex, the book has immediate and substantial value to all  organizations (regardless of size or nature) which need both a \\"roadmap\\"  and an \\"operations manual\\" during their quest for profits in the  \\"E-conomy.\\"ulate solid concepts, develop strategies and tactics, and  then take appropriate action with (in the authors' words) \\"ruthless  execution.\\" Although most of the companies discussed in Net Ready are large  and complex, the book has immediate and substantial value to all  organizations (regardless of size or nature) which need both a \\"roadmap\\"  and an \\"operations manual\\" during their quest for profits in the  \\"E-conomy.\\"	2000-01-07

According to its authors, this book &quot;offers a new and useful way of thinking about strategy in a world economy that is rapidly integrating....[therefore] the pace of economic transformation will  continue to accelerate over the next several decades. In the next thirty  years we will see radical econmic structuring in every industry and every  national economy.&quot; Strategies are urgently needed to build a great  global firm. Race for the World provides such strategies.<br />I like the way  the book is organized. First, the sauthors examine the nature and extent of  &quot;the race&quot; in terms of the transition economy, running the race,  gaining the high ground en route, and (meanwhile) maintaining control to  accommodate the market-capitalization imperative. Then in Part II, the  authors shift their attention to what is necessary to &quot;winning the  race.&quot; Not every reader will fully agree with all of their  observations and suggestions; however, all readers will (in my opinion)  welcome the authors' circumspection, precision, and attention to relevant  detail. This is a very carefully reasoned work.<br />For me, one of the most  valuable sections of the book is &quot;Moving Forward: Classes of  Ideas&quot; in Chapter 11, the final chapter. According to the authors,  there are three &quot;classes of ideas&quot;: those which have high returns  relative to investment because they leverage a company's existing  familiarity advantage; those which have the potential to offer attractive  returns, but require that unfamiliarity be overcome before risks and  returns can be reasonably estimated; and finally, those which involve real  uncertainty...especially in terms of risk.<br />The &quot;race for the  world&quot; will be won by those who formulate and then manage these three  classes of ideas, who shape the future by competing in the transition  economy in new ways. The authors favor &quot;intangible-heavy, capital  light approaches&quot; to building superior value propositions. Race for  the World provides no guarantees. (The authors know better than that.)  Rather, like a beacon on a foggy day or a dark night, Race for the World  suggests a prudent direction to follow...and one then to be followed with  both caution and passion.perior value propositions.

Those with extensive experience in the so-called E-conomy have learned (with the scar tissue to prove it) that words like \\"always\\" and \\"never\\" are irresponsible. So much for the title. Modahl writes with great skill. She has assembled a wealth of material which is Consumers (everything starts there...without such understanding, it probably ends there), Exploiting Internet Business Models (as Derek Bok once observed, \\"If you think education is expensive, try ignorance\\"), and then Defying the Gravity of the Old Ways of Doing Business (much easier said than done but imperative nonetheless). Modahl then provides an Appendix in which she examines \\"Technographics Methodology.\\" I strongly recommend that, periodically, this Appendix be re-read in light of the certain and sometimes major changes which will occur in the E-conomy.<br />Informed by what seems to be an avalanche of real-world evidence, Modahl identifies five \\"alarming\\" trends:<br />-New pricing models that undermine existing revenues.<br />-Higher customer-service expectations.<br />-New ways to distribute products.<br />-Unexpected market opportunities.<br />-High rates of entry--even in very staid markets.<br />Given these trends, what to do? Modahl offers all manner of options, in combination with specific suggestions as to how \\"the battle for Internet consumers\\" can be won while retaining long-term value in an Internet business. Some of the winners will be traditional companies; others will be dotcoms. Modahl asserts that \\"The past is not what will drive the future.\\" Some may agree with William Faulkner who observed, \\" The past isn't even the past yet.\\"<br />In the final chapter, Modahl summarizes brilliantly the key points she has so carefully developed earlier. She then concludes, \\"In the end, the companies that win the battle for the Internet consumers will be the ones that really want to.\\" At least in this context, for many of those unwilling and/or unable to engage in that \\"battle\\" now, tomorrow may indeed be too late.ant to.\\" At least in this context, for many of those unwilling and/or unable to engage in that \\"battle\\" now, tomorrow may indeed be too late.	2000-01-07

(He has won two Pulitzer Prizes for his reporting for The New York Times.) Over time, he has earned prominence as an interpreter of world affairs. His earlier book, From  Bierut to Jerusalem, won the National Book Award in 1988. Curiously, what  most reviewers of The Lexus and the Olive Tree have (as yet) failed to  point out is that Friedman is also a moralist with passionate concerns  about the negative impact of globalization. He really cares about  individuals, families, villages and towns...indeed entire cultures...which,  over time, forsake or have taken from them a unique identity. He accepts  the inevitability of globalization; he does not accept the inevitability of  homogenization. With all due respect to the superior quality of the Lexus  automobile, Friedman affirms the need for preserving the olive tree amidst  the \\"inexorable integration\\" of virtually everything within the world they  share.<br />Friedman asserts that either human beings manage the system or it  will manage them. The choice is theirs. Are there strategies and guidelines  for such management? Yes. Are the separate cultures of the Lexus and olive  tree necessarily mutually exclusive? No. Friedman concludes his brilliant  analysis as follows: \\"A healthy global society is one which can balance the  Lexus and the olive tree all the time., and there is no better model for  this on earth today than America. And that's why I believe so strongly that  for globalization to be sustainable America must be at its best -- today,  tomorrow, all the time. It not only can be, it must be, a beacon for the  whole world. Let us not squander this precious legacy.\\" In remarks such as  these, Friedman clearly reveals the passion of his convictions.	2000-01-06

According to John Cleese, author Guy Claxton provides &quot;The essential guide to  creative thinking&quot; in a book published by The Ecco Press. Almost  immediately we are informed that &quot;Roughly speaking, the mind possesses  three different processing speeds. The first is faster than  thought....Below this, there is another mental register that proceeds more  slowly still. It is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful,  leisurely or dreamy....[the] third type of intelligence is associated with  what we call ceativity, or even 'wisdom'.&quot;<br />With delicious wit as  well as probing insight, Claxton helps us to understand learning by  osmosis; the potential value of intuition and creativity to decision-making  and problem-solving; why reason and intuition are sometimes antagonists;  the phenomenon of perception without consciousness; the  &quot;rudiments&quot; of wisdom; and, how to recognize situations in which  there is greater need for the tortoise's &quot;slower ways&quot; than for  those of the hare who, in many quests for understanding, either arrives  later or not at all.<br />This is a very informative, highly entertaining  book.	2000-01-06

Annie Brooking's book  was published prior to Thomas A. Stewart's book which has the same title. Both are worthy of rigorous scrutiny because, although they share the same subject, they take entirely different  approaches to it.<br />The subtitle of Brooking's book introduces her  perspective on intellectual capital: &quot;Core Asset for the Third  Millennium Enterprise.&quot; She identifies four categories of assets:  market (the potential an organization has due to market-related  intangibles), intellectual property (know-how, trade secrets, copyright,  patent, and various design rights), human-centered (talents, skills,  experience, loyalty), and infrastructure (whatever brings order, safety,  correctness, and quality to an organization).<br />Throughout Intellectual  Capital, Brooking includes a number of &quot;audits&quot; which enable her  reader to measure value of an organization's brand, name, backlog,  distribution, collaboration, patent(s), copyright(s), design, trade  secrets, human-centered assets, employee education, vocational  qualification, work related knowledge, occupational assessment, work  related competency, corporate learning, management philosophy, corporate  culture, information technology systems, database, networking, IT  management, and IC management.<br />Brooking explains HOW to make accurate  measurements of these and other intangible assets, and, suggests HOW to  manage them with meticulous care. The &quot;Corporate Culture for  Collaboration&quot; audit in Chapter 6, all by itself, is well worth the  price of the book.<br />Unless and until organizations accurately measure  both their tangible and intangible assets, it will be impossible to  determine the real-world value of those organizations. This is especially  true as dot.com companies proliferate.	2000-01-06

We are told that &quot;the purpose of the book is to tell you how to get information, and most important, [how to] analyze it so that you can make the right decisions....So the main theme of this book is not to promote  research -- it's to inform you of ways to find out more about your  customer, your competition's customers, and trends in the marketplace.\\" For  Beemer, \\"predatory\\" is a synonym for proactive: \\"I'm a firm believer is  taking an offensive -- rather than defensive position; marketing is always  an offensive weapon.\\" Recall John Newbern's comment: \\"People can be divided  into three groups: those who make things happen, those who watch things  happen, and those who wonder what happened.\\" To these Beemer would probably  add a fourth group: Those who wait for something to happen and then respond  too late (if at all).<br />The title of Predatory Marketing is somewhat  misleading. it really does not suggest strategies to \\"win today's  customers\\" which require what the word &quot;predator&quot; denotes or even  suggests. On the contrary, the advice offered is highly ethical as well as  immensely practical. Many of the suggestions have previously been offered  by others. Nonetheless, reminders of key points can often have substantial  value.<br />One of the book's greatest benefits consists of a series of ten  \\"Consumer Mind Reader\\" analyses of trends as well as tendencies which  reveal consumer preferences are as well as the reasons for them. Another  substantial benefit is derived from a series of check-lists and multi-step  sequences which suggest how to implement the information  provided.<br />Marketing either creates or increases demand for whatever one  offers. For those whose organizations compete in a flat or declining  marketplace, only increasing share will enable them to achieve sybstantial  growth. Leaders of these organizations will probably derive the greatest  benefit from Predatory Marketing.<br />As Jeffrey Gitomer correctly suggests,  &quot;customer satisfaction&quot; occurs on a transaction basis. One bad  experience and the customer is gone...perhaps forever. &quot;Customer  loyalty&quot; must be earned over time so that, when a customer has a bad  experience, the relationship with that customer is not necessarily  destroyed.<br />Predatory Marketing places great emphasis on a thorough  understanding of both current and prospective customers. Such understanding  is even more important, obviously,  when attempting to  &quot;capture&quot;  customers from competitors. Reading Predatory Marketing will assist such  initiatives.ot;customer satisfaction&quot; occurs on a transaction basis.

Of course, the David and Goliath metaphor is invoked. The  co-authors stress the importance of courage, ten survival strategies, and  \\"about 500 stones.\\" (David needed only one well-placed stone. Today, he  would need more \\"ammunition\\" because there are so many different \\"giants\\"  to conquer. It is worth noting that David did not wrestle Goliath.)  Interestingly, the \\"Big Three\\" (Wal-Mart, Kmart, and Target) all opened  their first stores in 1962. They were not the first discounters but they  had learned a great deal from pioneers such as Ann and Hope, Korvettes,  Zayres, Arlands, and Gibson's. Once \\"Davids\\" themselves, they eventually  became \\"Goliaths\\", demonstrating (in process) the importance of the ten  strategies which are examined in Up Against the Wal-Marts.<br />The authors  organize the material according to three overriding themes: change,  improve, and succeed. In the 1990s, change has been the only constant.  Improvement is not an option; it is an imperative. With regard to success,  the co-authors leave their reader with this final statement: \\"Many small  businesses are going to be successful competing with the giants, and we  can't think of any reason why yours shouldn't be one of them.\\"	2000-01-06

Probably because the way most people attempt to sell is just as painful for everyone else involved (notably prospects) as it is for them. Think about it. Do you  resent what is called the &quot;hard sell&quot;? Are you less inclined to  buy if you feel pressured? Have there been situations in your own  experience when the pressure of a &quot;hard sell&quot; convinced you NOT  to buy what you had intended to? These and other issues are addressed in  High Probability Selling, co-authored by Jacques Werth &amp; Nicholas E.  Ruben. In effect, they challenge most (if not all) of the traditional  assumptions about the cultivation/solicitation process. They create a  fictitious salesman and then, using him as their focal point, demonstrate  the principles of high probability selling.  The co-authors do agree with  traditional thinking on at least one point: Sales is a numbers game. The  question to consider is this: At which point in the  cultivation/solicitation process should the probability of a sale be  measured? Stated another way, at which point in this process should most  time and effort be allocated? Conventional thinking offers quite different  answers than do Werth &amp; Ruben. Read  High Probability Selling  and then  determine for yourself which answers make more sense.	2000-01-06

Griffith.<br />Time and again, McNeilly stresses  (as does Sun Tzu) the absolute importance of personal character. Respect  and trust are earned, not conferred by title or decree. It remains for  leaders to formulate the correct strategies as well as those tactics needed  to implement them. It remains for leaders to allocate resources only where  they will achieve the greatest possible success at the lowest acceptable  cost. Whether the competition is on a battlefield or in a marketplace, the  six principles discussed by McNeilly are appropriate to whatever strategy  or strategies may be needed. Historically, the most successful armies and  the most successful companies have shared much in common: meticulous  preparation, superb timing, speed, maximum use of resources where they will  have the greatest impact,  sufficient intelligence on opponents, mobility,  flexibility, and (above all) resolve.<br />In Sun Tzu and the Art of Business  , McNeilly provides a brilliant analysis of six specific principles (first  set to writing almost 2,500 years ago) which, he correctly suggests, will  enable all manner of organizations to formulate appropriate strategies for  the New Millennium. This is a solid, eloquent, sharply-focused book. Unlike  so many other authors who force analogies between war and business,  McNeilly respects the basic (indeed obvious) differences between them while  explaining how certain principles are relevant to both.explaining how certain principles are relevant to both.	2000-01-06

They were selected and organized by Nan Stone. Each is a  classic.<br />Other business books three times greater in length offer about a  third of what this anthology does in terms of substance.  In Part I,  Drucker examines &quot;The Manager's Responsibilities&quot; and in Part II,  &quot;The Executive's World.&quot; When nearing his 90th birthday, Drucker  observes that he is &quot;not comfortable with the word manager any more,  because it implies subordinates.&quot; This is a revealing comment in light  of what the word profession literally means: &quot;to make a public  declaration or vow.&quot; For Drucker, professionals are those who have  crystal clear, non-negotiable values and make a total commitment to them.  Drucker may have doubts about the word &quot;manager&quot; but certainly  has no doubts about the absolute importance of  having impeccable  integrity.<br />He reaffirms his conviction that the &quot;fundamental task  of management remains the same: to make people capable of joint performance  by giving them common goals, common values, the right structure, and the  ongoing training and development they need to perform and to respond to  change.&quot;<br />Are there any predictions in Peter Drucker on the  Profession of Management? No. Rather, Drucker examines the implications of  a future &quot;that has already happened.&quot; Only time will tell who  prove equal to the challenges he has so eloquently identified. Authentic  professionals are those who combine talent and skill with character. The  challenges which await them will surely test their talent and skill but  must never be allowed to compromise their character.	2000-01-06

That is,  \\"Business Leadership the Marine Corps Way.\\" For example,  \\"If all  employees in a company, from the CEO to the line assembler, believe that they work for the best company in the industry, that they are without peer,  and that those who work for the competition do so because they are not  qualified to work for the best in the business, then an applicant may be  motivated to join for reasons other than money.\\" For example, executives  who \\"command from a forward position\\" get out from behind a desk and leave  the office to walk the shop floor. They visit other facilities, meet with  small groups of employees to brief them on company news, attend initial  meetings with prospects, call on customers, attend tradeshows, and in  countless other ways \\"fight side-by-side with the troops\\" there in the  \\"trenches\\"...whatever and wherever those trenches may be.  Carrison and  Walsh then ask us to envision an organization in which the majority of its  creative and intelligent people walked around all day with the thought `I  must not fail' in the back of their minds. Such an organization would be  formidable indeed.\\"<br /><br />It remains for each reader of Semper Fi to determine  what is most relevant to her or his own organization. Whenever groups of  people are assembled with a common purpose, there will always be a need for  leadership. With more than 200 years of experience developing leaders  \\"throughout the ranks\\", the Marine Corps remains a unique organization of  enduring excellence.	2000-01-06

Only by  understanding those causes can  a leader overcome them. O'Toole insists that organizations and their  leaders must not simply change to accommodate new realities. To do so would  merely be expediency. Also, such accommodation could create other (perhaps  even more painful) new realities Organizatiopns must transform themselves  constantly and effectively while, and here is a key point, sustaining  certain non-negotiable core values.<br />According to O'Toole, \\"today's  executives believe they are struggling with an unprecedented leadership  challenge to create internal strategic unity within a chaotic external  environment...Executives know what needs to be done and even how to do it.  Nonetheless, they are unable to lead change effectively. Explaining the  sources of this paradox and offering a practical way to resolve it are the  purposes of this book.\\"<br />After many years of active involvement with all  manner of organizations, O'Toole obviously understands why there is such  great resistance to change. Also, he knows why visionaries such as Robert  Owen fail to attract the support they need. However the magnificence of a  given vision, only effective leadership can ensure that such a vision has a  sustainable, enduring impact.<br />O'Toole concludes this brilliant book with  a rejection of leadership by command, manipulation, or  paternalism...insisting once again that only value-based leadership can be  both moral and effective. \\"Once a leader makes that commitment, all the  other pieces will eventually fall into place, bit by bit.\\"<br />Those who  admire this book as much as I do are encouraged to read the recently  published Leadership A to Z in which O'Toole provides a &quot;guide for the  appropriately ambitious.&quot; It is a stunning intellectual achievement.

More Likely, Increased Visibility	According to Delano, \\"...the first half of this book is focused on the seven proven principles and a proven process to find a great brand name -- a brand name that launches the product, service, or business venture into  the world's marketplace or replaces one that has proven to be a marketing  dud....The book's second half is devoted to what it takes to build a great  brand name into the omnipowerful brand -- a brand that transcends the very  product that put it on the map.\\"<br />Delano delivers on this promise.<br />The  \\"omnipowerful brand\\" is that which has the most appropriate name, that  which transcends what it is and does, and that which (in effect) takes on a  life of its own. It has its own distinctive personality. Some names become  generic: \\"Xeroxing\\" can be accomplished on several different brands of  photocopiers. Some names have a permanent association with their company:  \\"AAdvantage\\" with American Airlines. (What are the names of the other major  airlines' frequent flier programs?) Names are important. For Delano, the  naming of any product or service is critically important. However, great  names are essentially worthless if they are misnomers: failing to be and/or  do what they explicitly or implicitly promise.<br />In the final chapter,  Delano observes: \\"America's best-run companies...pay close attention to all  the key elements that affect the health and vigor of their most prized  asset -- the brand....The best news of all is that the omnipowerful brand  is within reach of every company regardless of its size or business  sector.\\" Even companies with little (if any) money to spend on advertising  can still derive substantial benefit from The Omnipowerful Brand. It will  help them to answer such basic questions as these: We know who we are and  what we sell but what is our brand? What makes it unique? How can we  nourish and strengthen it? How can we leverage it? The answers to these  questions will help any company as continues to orbit in a perilous galaxy.a perilous galaxy.	2000-01-06

The book explains how.  Substantial attention is devoted to the branding phase during which a symbol is strategically created, conveys a positioning, provides tangible value, and is most effectively managed on a daily basis.  &quot;Drivers&quot; of identity are also explained as is the procedure for cross-functional coordination and other components of what should be a cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective marketing program.<br />During the course of Marketing Aesthetics, the authors examine a number of different products for which various companies achieve &quot;a powerful point of (aesthetics as a strategic tool); Lucent Technologies and Continental Airlines (creating identity and image through aesthetics); IBM (corporate and brand expressions); Starbucks and Gillette (styles); Pepperidge Farm Cookies (themes); The Four Seasons (overall customer impressions); LEGO and Bosch (comprehensive identity management); Godiva and Nike (retail spaces and environments); and Volkswagen, Netscape, and Yahoo! (corporate and brand identity on the Internet). Throughout Marketing Aesthetics, the focus is on real-world corporate experience which the authors carefully examine in support of their assertion that &quot;Business processes do not provide value to customers. Core competencies do not. Even brands per se do not.  Value is provided only by satisfying needs.&quot; Moreover, &quot;In a world in which most consumers have their basic needs satisfied, value is easily provided by satisfying customers' experiential needs -- their aesthetic needs.&quot;<br />Marketing Aesthetics thus explains the most effective strategies for achieving both brand and identity objectives.

If our organs of computation are a  product of natural selection (as Pinker asserts they are), then natural  selection must be viewed as \\"the only evolutionary force that acts like an  engineer, `designing' organs that accomplish improbable but adaptive  outcomes.\\" Having thus introduced and then discussed what he calls the  \\"standard equipment\\" for computation in Chapter 1, Pinker shifts his  attention to Thinking Machines in Chapter 2. According to Plato, Pinker  notes, \\"we are trapped inside a cave and know the world only through the  shadows it casts upon the wall. The skull is our cave, and mental  representations are the shadows. The information in an internal  representation is all that we know about the world.\\"<br />In succeeding  chapters, Pinker completes his analysis of what the mind is, how it  evolved, and how it allows us to see, think, feel, laugh, interact, create,  invent, discover, and in countless other ways function.<br />Caves and shadows  have existed since long before Plato formulated his allegory.  It remains  for the mind to be aware of them, and, to recognize (if not always resolve)  the \\"mysteries\\" they suggest. Some careless readers may complain that How  the Mind Works raises more questions than it answers. Pinker would probably  accept that complaint as a compliment.	2000-01-06

What soon becomes clear, however, is that Drucker is a life-long learner with an  insatiable curiosity about many subjects which are wholly unrelated to  business per se. The book consists of nine chapters which, together,  examine Drucker's multi-dimensional life since his birth in Vienna in 1909.<br />Correctly, Drucker has been described by Warren Bennis as \\"one of the  few thinkers in any discipline who can claim to have changed the world: he  is the inventor of privatization, the apostle of a new class of knowledge  workers, the champion of management as a serious discipline.\\" It is  generally agreed that, until Drucker, the term \\"management\\" was not even in  the formal nomenclature of business. Today, management consulting is a  multi-billion dollar global enterprise which continues to experience  ever-increasing growth. Drucker gave that enterprise a definition, a  vision, and a rationale as well as many of its basic terms.<br />Beatty  neither thinks nor writes as well as Drucker. (Who does?) His  &quot;intellectual portrait&quot; is, however, an invaluable supplement to  any of Drucker's books and articles.<br />For more than 60 years, Peter  Drucker has made a positive and substantial difference in the personal as  well as professional lives of so many others throughout the world. With all  due respect to Peter Drucker's well-deserved recognition as a scholar of  business, that \\"difference\\" is his most valuable contribution.	2000-01-06

But in fact, The Four  Elements of Successful Management can be of substantial value to anyone who  has management responsibilities (regardless of level) or who reports to  those who do. Many CEOs and COOs need reminders of what they presumably  have already learned but perhaps forgotten or neglected. Moreover,  entry-level and mid-level managers are provided with a  comprehensive frame  of reference within which to understand the interdependence of the four  elements. After reading  Marshall's book, they will have greater respect  for the complicated challenges which their own supervisors must face each  day. And perhaps be better prepared to face those and/or other challenges  in years to come.<br />It is Marshall's assertion that \\"the reason managers  spend so much time directing is that they do a poor job on selection.\\"  Direction should begin &quot;with a strategic plan or business plan that  outlines the principal products and services a business wants to produce  for a specified market over a specified period of time.\\"<br />Throughout The  Four Elements of Successful Management, Marshall shares a wealth of  information and counsel. To at least some executives, perhaps, his ideas  may seem obvious...if not simplistic. Be that as it may, he raises all the  right questions and then provides answers which are sensible, practical,  and cohesive.	2000-01-06

Benton, there are 22 \\"vital traits\\" which one needs to develop fully. In How to Think Like A CEO, she examines each of them in detail while providing numerous examples of the success they have helped  others to achieve.<br />The mountain-climbing metaphor she invokes is  especially apt. In a Darwinian sense, the \\"fittest\\" climbers are those who  have the necessary training and equipment, of course, but also certain  personal qualities (especially tenacity, composure, self-discipline, and  endurance) which enable them to reach the desired \\"summit\\", whatever and  wherever it may be. Most limits in life are self-imposed. Stated another  way, many people under-estimate what they can accomplish while exaggerating  the difficulty of achieving whatever they may desire.<br />In How to Think  Like A CEO, Benton observes that in all her years of mountain climbing,  \\"more critical than the summit is the internal knowledge you gain; how to  deal with your own internal fears; how to be intuitive and humble and aware  of every detail; and how to live fully. And most important, I've learned my  goal is not just to climb up the mountains, but to give back to them.\\" This  she does by sharing so much of what she has learned.<br />Few who read this  book will become a CEO. I suspect that few CEOs will read it. (I may be  wrong about that.) Other books on the subject of leadership are far more  profound. (Warren Bennis wrote many of them.) In my opinion, How to Think  Like a CEO has substantial value because it enables its readers to take  stock of their personal as well as professional strengths and weaknesses in  correlation with the strengths of some of the world's most successful CEOs.  Completing such an exercise is obviously not all that an ambitious person  needs to succeed...but it can be a starting point, and perhaps a reality  check from time to time later as a career develops.	2000-01-06

As also indicated in the more recently published The Long Boom, his writing is as clear and crisp as his thinking. Schwartz's  comments and suggestions are anchored in extensive real-world experience.  His objective is to explain the process of what he calls  &quot;scenario-building&quot; which enables managers to &quot;invent and  then consider, in depth, several varied stories of equally plausible  futures&quot; so that they can make (in his words) &quot;strategic  decisions that will be sound for all plausible futures. No matter what  future takes place, you are much more likely to be ready for it -- and  influential in it -- if you have thought seriously about  scenarios.&quot;<br />Managers of companies (regardless of size or nature) are  already aware of constant change within their competitive marketplace.  Recent developments, notably use of the Internet to expedite globalization,  suggest that change will occur progressively faster and have progressively  greater impact, both positive and negative.<br />Meanwhile, for obvious  reasons, managers of companies face daily situations and circumstances  which require immediate attention and, more often than not, they must  quickly make decisions which have profound implications. As a result  managers find it very difficult to see &quot;the larger picture&quot;, to  maintain a &quot;long-term perspective.&quot;<br />Schwartz suggests how. Like  Drucker, he avoids making predictions. Rather, he helps his reader to  formulate the degree of probability of certain events yet to occur...and  then to prepare accordingly.	2000-01-05

He has identified a series of specific &quot;lifecycles. His analysis of each (within a  sequence) is especially valuable because, as he explains each with  meticulous care, each lifecycle is best understood within a broad as well  as deep frame of reference. A careful reader of Corporate Lifecycles can  thus determine (a) where his or her organization is now within the  sequence, (b) what will be required to reach or return to Prime or Stable  (the two most desirable locations within the sequence), and (c) what to  expect in terms of obstacles, perils, etc. en route.<br />Because the ideal  combination, the ideal balance, of four critical &quot;factors&quot; (ie  performance, administration, entrepreneurship, and integration) will always  be a &quot;moving target&quot; under constant &quot;attack&quot; by  internal as well as external forces, each organization must constantly be  aware of what that ideal combination is for it at any given time, what that  ideal balance should be. Change is the only constant.<br />There really isn't  another book quite like Corporate Lifecycles. My brief comments can only  begin to suggest Adizes' knowledge, wisdom, and experience which enable his  reader to understand how and why organizations grow and die...and what to  do about it.	2000-01-05

However, if you are already convinced that you cannot think more  creatively, you won't. Henry Ford once observed that those who think they  can and those who think they can't are both right.<br /><br />Cracking Creativity  will help you to develop the skills needed to release from within all  manner of ideas, perspectives, and insights which (until now) have been  suppressed. When we face an especially complicated problem or especially  difficult question, he suggests that we ask \\"What are the alternatives  and options? How should each be evaluated? Where are there possible  connections? Perhaps synergies?\\" Of course, after we think outside the  box and come up with really cool stuff, we have to figure out how to get it  back into the box. Perhaps that is another book Michalko will one day  write.<br /><br />On average, humans use only 15-17% of the cerebral cortex, that  portion of the brain where the most important intellectual transactions occur. No guarantees, of course, but chances are that a careful reading of  Cracking Creativity will increase the percentage you use. What are you  waiting for?	2000-01-05

Instead, to achieve sustained growth in profits and shareholder value, companies need a \\"customer-centric business design\\"  which anticipates and addresses constantly shifting customer priorities.  There is no single design which fits all circumstances. but the most  effective designs will start with customer priorities.<br />In Part Two, the  co-authors shift their attention to several \\"reinventors\\" who have achieved  extraordinary success. Most are familiar: Welch, Hayek, Goizueta, Schwab,  Grove, Eisner, Hatsopoulos, Barnevik, and Gates. However, and this is an  excellent example of the book's unique and substantial value, Slywotzy  &amp; Morrison note that \\"the principles and techniques of reinveniting a  company's business design to get it into the industry's profit zone...apply  with equal force to small companies, to divisions of larger companies, and  to the middle managers who run them. In fact, the reinventors we will be  reading about in the future are already honing their skills at innovative  business designs today.\\" The authors then examine several smaller firms  such as Madden Communications, Cardboard Box, Inc., and Clozaril Patient  Management System.<br />In Part Three, the authors provide a \\"handbook\\" which  explains in detail how innovation works.This book is relevant to all  organizations (both for-profit and non-profit) which seek to increase their  economic value. Non-profits must also make critically important decisions  (such as those involving allocation of resources) if they are to achieve  their objectives.

As in The Profit Zone, the co-authors pose and then answer key questions. They also provide numerous checklists which enable the thoughtful reader to undertake a rigorous self-diagnosis. For example, in Part II, such  questions and checklists direct and enrich understanding of Mega Patterns,  Value Chain Patterns, Channel Patterns, Product Patterns, Knowledge  Patterns, and Organizational Patterns. In effect, the authors create an  infrastructure within which to organize and then correlate the most  relevant experiences of dozens of corporations with the specific  circumstances of the reader's own organization. Better yet, although most  of the corporations discussed are among the \\"Fortune 100\\", this  infrastructure is of substantial (if not even greater) value to  small-to-midsize companies as well.<br />In Part III, Slywotsky &amp; Morrison  explain HOW \\"Strategic Anticipation\\" enables managers to anticipate and  respond quickly to patterns as they unfold. Strategic Anticipation helps  managers to \\"move where the value will be.\\"  Patterns \\"hint at the future  strategic story of a company or industry, explain the past and describe the  present.\\"<br />Those who have not read  Profit Patterns and do not plan to do  so can only hope is that the same is true of their competitors.

He examines The Information Age: Context, Intellectual Capital: Content, and The Next Connection. He attempts to &quot;make sense of the  dramatically changing world in which we work&quot; by focusing on three  separate but related components of the Information Age: Human Capital  (&quot;the capabilities of individuals required to provide solutions to  customers&quot;), Structural Capital (&quot;the organizational abilities of  the organization to meet market requirements...to codify bodies of  knowledge that can be transferred, to preserve the recipes that might  otherwise be lost&quot;...and &quot;to connect people to data, experts, and  expertise -- including bodies of knowledge -- on a just-in-time  basis&quot;), and Customer Capital (&quot;the value of an organization's  relationships with whom it does business&quot;). Of the three, Stewart  considers customer capital &quot;the most obviously valuable&quot; and yet  customer capital &quot;is probably-- and startingly when you think about it  -- the worst managed of all intangible assets.&quot;<br />One of the most  important chapters is Chapter 5. &quot;The Treasure Map&quot; contains  information which can prove far more valuable to a company than any gold  buried by pirates in the Caribbean. As with that gold, however,  intellectual capital must first be appreciated; located and recovered; and  then organized and managed with meticulous care. Hence the importance of  Chapter 9 in which Stewart offers ten principles for managing intellectual  capital. Hence the importance, also, of the Appendix in which he provides  all the other &quot;tools&quot; needed.<br />Let the digging begin!	2000-01-05

For those  unwilling and/or unable to make a commitment to achieving and then  sustaining excellence, their cause is hopeless. Fitz-enz insists that the  best organizations are led by those who effectively nourish as well as  manage human assets. Organizations grow only to the extent that those who  comprise them grow. As he correctly points out, &quot;In a knowledge  company, people are the only profit lever.&quot;<br />One final point: The  best practices for any organization are often found within that  organization. As a recruiting slogan for the U.S. Army suggests, &quot;Be  all that you can be.&quot; Stop looking for THE BIG ANSWER elsewhere. Look  within yourself and within your own organization. Discover how to implement  the eight practices in ways and to the extent  that are most appropriate.  Pogo once said, &quot;We have met the enemy and he is us.&quot; Fitz-enz  would perhaps accept a paraphrase of that: &quot;We have found ways to be  the best...and they are in us.&quot;ÿ	2000-01-04

Insightful, practical, wtitten with a crisp prose style. Beginning with Chapter 2 through Chapter 8, the authors provide a detailed summary of key points at the end of each chapter. These summaries  offer excellent checklists which could, perhaps, be discussed individually  during a staff or department meeting called to focus on a specific topic  such as \\"speed.\\". All by themselves, the summaries are well worth the price  of the book...and then some.<br />It is no mere coincidence that the same  companies which the editors of Fortune annually rate as the \\"most admired\\"  also have the greatest cap value. For the co-authors of Good Company,  the  term \\"good\\" refers to character as well as to competence, to decency as  well as to dedication. In their book, they examine their \\"peers from the  top 100\\" (Rosenbluth International is one of them), explaining why the best  companies to work for are the best companies to work with.<br />One of the  most valuable points in Good Company is that almost any company (regardless  of size or nature) can learn a great deal from the family farm model.  Obviously, there will be significant differences between and among  companies in terms of how they define terms such as \\"farm land\\", \\"seeds\\",  \\"crops\\", \\"harvest, \\"going to market\\", &quot;town&quot;, etc. Fair enough.  However, each farm is an organization which requires teamwork as well as  hard work, careful planning and constant attention, and a healthy respect  for natural forces.<br />Good Company  examines two models: the Rosenbluth  \\"farm\\" as well as the generic \\"family farm.\\" In process, Rosenbluth and  Peters take a close look at fifteen other companies which vary widely in  terms of size and nature. \\"What do all of these companies share in common?\\"  Good Company  answers that question. \\"Why are these same companies rated  the most highly respected?\\" Same answer. An abundant harvest awaits those  who care as fiercely as they compete.	2000-01-04

Feynman (Genius) have probably also read this collection of Feynman's &quot;best short works.&quot; This is indeed an odd collection. Feynman is most accessible  in the interviews and speeches; least accessible in his &quot;Minority  Report to the Space Shuttle Challenger Inquiry.&quot; Gleick's biography  reveals a man who exemplifies what Whitman had in mind when he observed  &quot;Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself. I am  large. I contain multitudes.&quot; Feynman was indeed large; he contained  multitudes. To read this book is to share the pleasure of his company as he  formally and informally shares his thoughts and feelings about himself, his  life, his career, and just about everything else which attracted his  attention. Chapter 1 (&quot;The Pleasure of Finding Things Out&quot;) and  Chapter 8 (&quot;What Is Science?&quot;) are my personal favorites. The  aforementioned &quot;Minority Report&quot; (Chapter 7) was, for me, tough  going. As I worked my way through this collection, I began to think that I  was in the company of someone who has Albert Einstein's intellect and Danny  Kaye's personality. Feyman must have been a flamboyant (albeit demanding)  classroom teacher. There can be no doubt about his intelligence. Nor his  passion and compassion. Nor his playfulness. How much I regret never having  known him personally. Therefore, how much I appreciate this collection  which I continue to re-read with joy.	2000-01-04

Why is it so important? In my opinion, because it provides the most convincing, the most compelling argument in support of Wendell Berry's assertion that &quot;what  is good for the world will be good for us.&quot; Darwin's concept of  natural selection becomes irrelevant if there is no environment in which  such selection can occur. The authors introduce us to &quot;The Next  Industrial Revolution&quot; with all oif its emerging possibilities. In  subsequent chapters, they continue to examine natural capitalism in terms  of &quot;four central strategies&quot;: radical resource productivity,  biomimicry, service and flow economy, and investment in it. According to  the authors, natural capitalism &quot;is about choices we can make that can  start to tip economic and social outcomes in positive directions. And it is  already occurring -- because it is necessary, possible, and  practrical.&quot; For me, the information provided in Chapter 3 was almost  incomprehensible in terms of the nature and extent of waste. Of the $9  trillion spent every year in the United States, at least $2 trillion is  wasted annually. How? For example: Highway accidents ($150 billion),  highway congestion ($100 billion in lost productivity), total hidden costs  of driving (nearly $1 trillion), nonessential/fraudulent healthcare ($65 billion), inflated and unnecessary medical overhead ($250 billion), and  crime ($450 billion). All of this waste can and should be reduced, if not  eliminated. What the authors present, in effect, is a blueprint for the  survival of the planet. All manner of statistical evidence supports their  specific recommendations. Unless &quot;The Next Industrial Revolution&quot;  succeeds in implementing those recommendations, natural capitalism will  eventually be depleted ...and no one left to regret its loss.	2000-01-04

Many of us who have the New  York Times delivered to our doorstep each day may perhaps view it primarily  (if not solely)  as an invaluable source of information and commentary. It  is certainly that. However, in The Trust, Tifft &amp; Jones enable us to  understand the multi-generational human infrastructure which -- over  several decades -- has guided the evolution of a struggling newspaper to  its current influence which includes but is by no means limited to  journalism. The Trust bears at least some resemblance to a novel: There are  so many colorful characters, so many plots and sub-plots, so many insights  into the texture and nuances of America society. If Tolstoy had written a  history of this unique dynasty, the result would probably be similar to  what Tifft &amp; Jones have produced. In my opinion, it would be difficult  (if not impossible) to understand the American 20th Century without  understanding the role played by the New York Times. The Trust is a  brilliant achievement in terms of its historical content; remarkably, it is  also compelling in terms of the narrative within which that content is  brought to life.	2000-01-03

This  book is about becoming a soloist.\\" She cites several different examples of  those who have done so. Peter Drucker is \\"a lone worker who refused for  years to let his local university, Claremont College, start a business  school in his honor because of his fear of becoming a person who has to  take meetings.\\" For him, a waste of time. Drucker once gave Rubin two  pieces of advice: It takes three years to break even financially as a  soloist, and to learn anything you have to be prepared to teach it. Rubin  seems to be a natural teacher. In Soloing, she helps others to understand  both the perils soloing creates, and, the rewards which await those who  overcome the perils.<br />Rubin understands full well that soloing is not for  everyone. However, if you now live a life of &quot;quiet desperation&quot;,  if you feel trapped within an organizational structure which limits (if not  demeans) you, then you should read Soloing. Plato once described a  situation in which people sat in a cave watching shadows dance on the wall.  Once in a while, someone would discover the true source of light. It was  outside the cave. For a soloist, it is inside the person.<br />One final  point: The title is somewhat misleading. Although recommending \\"going it  alone\\" and \\"being complete in oneself\\", Rubin duly acknowledges a number of  people who encouraged her during the initial, immensely difficult phase of  her own soloing process after she walked away from a lucrative but  unfulfilling career situation. Soloists are not alone. Rather, as has  Rubin, they tend to develop new relationships, new networks, and new  friends. Also, as Rubin learned, and more importantly, the journey within  (required by soloing) results in a quite different relationship with one's  self. Not everyone is willing to complete such a journey. So be it.f. Not everyone is willing to complete such a journey. So be it.	1999-12-31

First published in 1995 by Oxford University Press, America's Competitive Secret suggests how to utilize women as a management strategy. It was an excellent idea then and an even better idea now as globalization  initiatives of American companies increase and intensify. In the Preface,  author Judy B. Rosener explains that her book is intended for executives  and managers \\"who want to improve their organization's bottom line, and for  women who wonder why their career paths so often seem to be shaped by the  fact that they are female.\\" Note the reference to \\"bottom line.\\" For  Rosener, it is prudent to leverage the talents of professional women\\"  inorder to create \\"more innovative, productive, and profitable  organizations.\\"  Also, for male executives, the principle of enlightened  self-interest is relevant to their own success. It makes absolutely no  sense to under-utilize the talents of women professionals, especially as  the global economy continues to expand so rapidly and extensively. Rosabeth  Kanter agrees: \\"Whatever the duration and objectives of business  alliances,...in the global economy, a well-developed ability to create and  sustain fruitful collaborations gives companies a significant competitive  leg up.\\" Hence the importance of women.<br />As Connie Glaser and Barbara  Steinberg Smalley suggest in  Swim with the Dolphins, the female  temperament is better suited than is the male's to concluding \\"win-win\\"  negotiations, resolving conflicts, reaching consensus, preferring to  cooperate and collaborate rather than compete, keeping an open mind, asking  direct and relevant but not insulting questions, etc. Rosener describes the  female temperament in terms of \\"consensus building, power sharing, and  comfort with ambiguity.\\"<br />She examines five &quot;stages&quot; through  which organizations must proceed if they are to undergo the transformation  required by new realities as well as opportunities:  Stage One:  Staying Out  of Trouble Stage Two: We Need to  React  Stage Three: It's a Case of Survival  Stage Four: It's the  Right Thing to Do  Stage Five: It's Part of Our Culture<br />Females as  well as males within an organization will proceed from one stage to the  next at varying speeds and within varying timeframes. Fair enough. However,  all must reach Stage Five. Rosener recommends that, from both a strategic  and financial point of view, structural reorganization \\"should be  undertaken in concert with efforts to rectify female underutilization.  Flexibility and diversity are two keys to competitive advantage, and both  are closely related to the underutilization issue.\\"<br />So much in the  business world has changed since 1995 when this book was first published.  However, many American companies and most companies in other countries have  yet to take full advantage of -- and reward appropriately -- the talents of  women. The companies which do so have a significant competitive advantage,  a &quot;secret weapon&quot; if you will. Professional women know at which  companies they will be appreciated and rewarded, where there are the  greatest opportunities for their personal as well as professional growth.  It is no coincidence that these are the same companies which, year after  year, are the most profitable in their respective industries. At least  until now, many of our nation's companies seem unaware of or indifferent to  this &quot;competitive secret.&quot;We Need to      React  Stage Three: It's a Case of Survival  Stage Four: It's the  Right Thing to Do  Stage Five: It's Part of Our Culture<br />Females as  well as males within an organization will proceed from one stage to the  next at varying speeds and within varying timeframes.

Co-authored by  Connie Glaser and Barbara Steinberg Smalley (and published by Warner  Books), Dolphins  explains \\"how women can succeed in corporate America on  their own terms.\\"There are dozens of checklists throughout  Dolphins which  are of practical and immediate value. Also insightful profiles of women who  have succeeded in business. No two are the same, of course, but they tended  to face (and overcome) the same barriers. I suggest that  Dolphins be read  in combination with Peter Drucker on the Profession of Management  (published by Harvard Business School Press) because Drucker's various  essays provide a rock-solid framework within which to apply the wealth of  information and wisdom which Glaser and Smalley so generously provide in  Dolphins. To a significant extent, this is a \\"what to do...what not to do\\"  guide for women who are determined to succeed in corporate America. For  that reason alone, it is a stunning achievement. But I think the book's  importance transcends narrowly-defined (albeit legitimate) gender issues.  There is much that all of us, male or female, can learn from Dolphins. And  there is much for all of us, male or female, to do. For example,  eliminating all of the barriers to success for women in corporate America.  Most of them are illegal and all of them are unconscionable.	1999-12-31

The strategies are  often quite similar...if not the same. For example, greeting visitors to a  website shares much in common with greeting those who enter a retail  establishment in a mall. In both situations, ease and convenience are  critically important to attracting traffic; hospitality gives customers a  feeling of being welcome, indeed appreciated. Obviously, the website is a  unique environment within which to establish and nourish customer  relationships but customers in any environment are still human beings with  certain expectations,  requirements, and sensitivities. Those now involved  or about to become involved in e-commerce will learn a great deal from  Seybold's book. I also recommend this book to everyone else for whom  customer loyalty is also absolutely essential.	1999-12-29

The titles of its ten chapters suggest the nature and extent of subjects covered: The Information Economy,  Pricing Information, Versioning Information, Rights Management, Recognizing  Lock-In, Managing Lock-In, Networks and Positive Feedback, Cooperation and  Compatibility, Waging a Standards War, and Information Policy. In effect,  Information Rules combines all of the benefits of an operations manual with  the counsel of two renowned experts who accompany the reader, step by step,  through the manual.<br />According to the authors, the thesis of their book is  that \\"durable economic principles can guide you through today's frenetic  business environment. Technology changes. Economic laws do not. If you are  struggling to comprehend what the Internet means for you and your business,  you can learn a great deal from the advent of the telephone system a  hundred years ago.\\" That's true. The interdependence of information  (software) and infrastructure (hardware) will always be important, indeed  imperative. Therefore, interconnection battles are won only if, for  example, local telephone companies in 1900 were interconnected with Bell to  provide long-distance service and, 100 years later, browsers are  interconnected with operating systems.<br />Who will gain the greatest value  from this book? Owners/CEOs of small-to-midsize companies which are  struggling to decide what to do...and what not to do...with opportunities  created by the Internet and, more specifically, the WWW. Also, senior-level  executives of much larger organizations (both for-profit and  not-for-profit) who must formulate long-term strategies to achieve  sustainable prudent growth.<br />For thousands of years, there has never been  a shortage of available information but until the printing press, access to  it was severely limited. Since then, a variety of media have broadened and  deepened that access and, indeed, the volume of available information has  increased exponentially.<br />Which strategies will be most effective when one  faces such challenges?

Its brilliant young inventors  produced a number of breakthroughs in office technology. Hiltzik examines  each of the key scientists, led by Bob Taylor, as well as Steve Jobs and  others who visited to observe and to learn... and departed with information  without which they probably could not have succeeded. This is a riveting  account of collaborative genius. It has the colorful characters and  multiple of plots (and sub-plots) one encounters in a novel written by  Dickens or Balzac. Bennis and Biederman devote one chapter in Organizing  Genius to the PARC operations. For those who desire a complete account of  those memorable years, here it is...well-told.	1999-12-29

In it,  Drexler analyzes \\"the coming era of nanotechnology.\\" Obviously, that era  has (since 1986) arrived. Nonetheless, Drexler's observations remain both  valid and instructive. The book is organized as Part One: The Foundations  of Foresight, Part Two: Profiles of the Possible, and Part Three: Dangers  and Hopes. In certain respects, Engines of Creation is even more valuable  today than it was when first published. It should be required reading for  undergraduate and graduate students (especially those at work on a degree  in engineering, the natural sciences, mathematics, or business) as well as  for executives in organizations which hope to survive the &quot;age of  nanotechnology.&quot; Think of your organization as a vehicle. Viewed as  such, it obviously needs an engine, fuel, a transmission, a brake, an  accelerator, etc.  Speed is only one component of the formula for success.  Durability is another. For your organization to reach its destination, it  must also have a map. Engines of Creation is about technology, of course,  and it is also about innovation in an age when speed is often the  difference between success and failure. But Drexler also provides the  equivalent of a map to guide his reader. Misdirected speed can demolish an  entire organization as well as a single vehicle....and those within it.  Years from now, Engines of Creation will still be read and admired. Why?  Because it will still be relevant.	1999-12-29

Chasm \\"is unabashedly about and for marketing within high tech enterprises.\\" It was written for the entire high tech  community \\"to open up the marketing decision making during this [crossing]  period so that everyone on the management team can participate in the  marketing process.\\" In Chasm, Moore isolates and then corrects what he  describes as a \\"fundamental flaw in the prevailing high-tech marketing  model\\": the notion that rapid mainstream growth could follow continuously  on the heels of early market success. In his subsequent book, Inside the  Tornado, Moore's use of the \\"tornado\\" metaphor correctly suggests that  turbulence of unprecedented magnitude has occurred within the global  marketplace which the WWW and the Internet have created. Moreover, such  turbulence is certain to intensify. Which companies will survive? Why? I  have only one (minor) quarrel with the way these two books have been  promoted. True, they provide great insights into marketing within the high  technology industry. However, in my opinion, all e-commerce (and especially  B2B) will be centrally involved in that industry. Moreover, the marketing  strategies suggested are relevant to virtually (no pun intended) any  organization -- regardless of size or nature -- which seeks to create or  increase demand for what it sells...whatever that may be. I consider both  books &quot;must reading.&quot;ÿ	1999-12-28

He analyzes each in Net Future. These trends are already underway and in  various stages of development. What makes Net Future so valuable is that it  enables its reader to place his or her organization in correct  juxtaposition and then proper alignment with each of these trends;  moreover, Martin (functioning as both travel guide and consultant) explains  to his reader  how to make whatever adjustments may be necessary inorder  for her or his organization to succeed. Of course, all of the seven  cybertrends are driven by technology. \\"Together they comprise the Net  future.\\" Fair enough. The challenge, as Martin clearly understands, is to  manage these cybertrends...or be dominated by them. Many may quarrel with  the number specified (Covey probably wouldn't) and others may challenge  Martin's explanation of those he selects. Whatever. The point is, this is  an immensely informative book in which Martin the futurist shares his  visions and then Martin the consultant helps his reader to understand the  trends which will probably define that future. Each reader may feel that  Net Future was written specifically for her or him. At least that was my  reaction. I strongly recommend this book to anyone in need of an  intellectual framework within which to organize troublesome ambiguities as  well as quantifiable realities.	1999-12-28

They suggest several,  each worthy of careful consideration. For me, this book has two great  values: It helps us to understand what a &quot;killer app&quot; is and can  accomplish; also,  for those lacking a &quot;killer app&quot; and without  much chance of possessing one, it suggests how to increase and enhance the  appeal of what one does have, such as it is. Given a choice, of course,  anyone would prefer to have a &quot;killer app&quot; when proceeding into  an uncertain future. Lacking one, there are still opportunities to  recognize...and to pursue. Most companies will not dominate but can survive  if committed to the appropriate strategies. For them, this book could well  be the difference between life and death.	1999-12-28

In my opinion, he has helped to set a  new &quot;table&quot; at which the rest of us can examine a variety of  menus as well as the materials required to feast on the opportunities of  the Digital Age.
