A shipload of pirates, serving the 13 original American Colonies as Privateers, help bring Christmas to Savannah, Georgia, before the British invasion. The book is mainly told from a young boy's view. The two youngest crew members, and Lucky (the ship's dog mascot), teach kids American history in such a way that they never realize they are soaking up information.  <br /> <br />The authors tell the difference between Pirates and Privateers, as well as, the difference between Loyalists and Patriots. The crew rescues a white dolphin, engage in combat, rescue a lady and her daughter, and even bring the Christmas spirit to Savannah. Kids of today can see how the kids of yesterday lived day-to-day. They will even learn about cobblestones!  <br /> <br />***** The captain is an intelligent white man who actually cares for his crew and their safety. There is a black officer who offers a glimpse into what is going on with African Americans during that time. There are some very well done illustrations throughout the book to help children visualize the events as they unfold. All-in-all, the story has a little bit of just about everything and will entertain (and quietly teach) kids much about life in the late 1700's. Highly recommended reading. ***** <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-10-10

So Christine hires a ski instructor and arrives a week before her family is due. She knows how to ski but needs to face the chairlift problem before her older brother, Robbie, arrives.  <br /> <br />Christine's father has always been proud of Robbie.

Does she take the job of her dreams back home or give up everything for the man of her dreams?  <br /> <br/>***** A stellar novel! Comedy, romance, tension, it's all in here. Once you begin reading you will not want to stop. In fact, I did not stop reading until I finished the entire book ... and realized the night was almost over, dawn was on the horizon. Therefore, I highly suggest you pick up a copy of this book and don't start reading until the weekend.

Queen Eleanor, of Aquitaine, established St. Jude's Abbey. There, young women train in the knightly arts, as well as the martial arts from the East. In times of trouble, when hope is slim, Queen Eleanor calls upon these women to protect the royal family and England.<br /><br />Elspeth Braybrooke's weapon of choice is a staff. Queen Eleanor gives her the task of locating the \\"Llech-lafar\\". It is a legendary stone of Merlin's. Prophecy states that if the King steps upon the stone he will die. So Elspeth's quest is to find the stone and keep the prophecy from happening.<br /><br />(Welsh Prince) Tarran ap Llyr and his men are escorting an elderly woman, Vala, to Tyddewi when they see Elspeth hanging from a castle's narrow window. Tarran is surprised to learn that she is trying to get in, rather than out. Soon Tarran and his men come to respect Elspeth's fighting abilities and bits of wisdom. Tarran convinces Elspeth to accompany them and keep Vala company. Since they are going her way, and it is safer to travel with a group, she agrees. Yet she must not let herself be diverted from her important task by Tarran's touch.<br /><br />Tarran feels the same heat of attraction for Elspeth. Yet he, too, must not be diverted. Tarran is searching for the man who murdered his wife, Bradwr ap Glew. A man who was once Tarran's most trusted friend.<br /><br />**** This is the second book involving the strong women of St. Jude's Abbey. (The first is titled A KNIGHT LIKE NO OTHER.) I found myself so engrossed in this story that I did not realize I was learning so much about English history! The tale grabbed my attention from the beginning, then kept up a steady pace of action, plot, and romance until the very end. You will never find yourself growing bored while reading this book.

Samantha Turner looks young, frail, and sweet. In truth she is ancient, strong, and extremely deadly. Samantha is a vampire. She wants to be mortal or at least pass for one. Since she moved into the neighborhood and opened The Artemis Shelter (a halfway house where women and children can heal and find a way out of abusive relationships), crime drastically reduced. The people that live in the area believe Samantha is, somehow, responsible for all their good fortunes. They don't know how right they are! Samantha only ventures outside during the day whenever the sun is weak. At night she patrols the neighborhood, going rooftop-to-rooftop, helping people and stopping crime. Then came a drive-by shooting. Samantha's speed let her save three of the children, even though she took two bullets herself. This could not be covered up. Others were dead in the street or wounded. Police and paramedics would come. Mortals who would ask questions that she dare not answer.  <br /> <br />Detective Peter Daly did not believe Ricardo's story. Ricardo claims to be the sole witness. But evidence points to Samantha being the witness instead. Why would they lie? What are they hiding?  <br /> <br />Samantha and Peter find themselves attracted to each other. Samantha knows she should get rid of Peter, yet she is drawn to him. Then her vampire friends begin disappearing.  <br /> <br />***** This series may be in the Silhouette line, but it is anything but normal. \\"THE CALLING\\" is a vampire series unlike any I have read. In 3/04 the series began with \\"Darkness Calls\\". Fans yelled for more. So in 6/05 \\"Danger Calls\\" was released. This story is the third in the series. Don't worry, each book can easily stand alone. You have no need to read the previous novels to fully understand and appreciate this one. Yet I recommend that you do so. Characters from earlier books show up to assist the new characters.  <br /> <br />Author Caridad Pieiro writes engrossing novels of the darker side of life. Sometimes I wonder if the author writes in blood, because the story simply oozes with realism. I often forget that vampires are not real. This is an outstanding tale that I highly recommend to all. *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-10-10

Multi-national corporations control everything, including the media and the government. Even the altars in churches are computerized. Religious cults are growing fast. Elder Nguyen Seth is the titular head of the Josephite Church. His sinister cult is the worst. He is known by many names, such as Seth the Eternal & Seth the Summoner. He has lived several life times already. Now he has summoned a minor demon and turned it into the form of a sub-sentient computer virus.  <br /> <br />Vatican hitwoman Chantal Juillerat is sent to Fort Apache in America to locate and destroy the demon. However, by the time she reaches Fort Apache, the demon is already inhabiting the central control and weapons system of a US Cavalry-issue road cruiser, equipped with multiple, state-of-the-art weaponry. And by the time Chantal and Trooper Nathan Stack catch up with the vehicle, the demon has taken over the altar of a Catholic Church. But that is all fore play. This living virus plans to take over Fort Apache itself, and then spread out. <br /> <br />The personnel of Fort Apache find themselves trapped inside their desert outpost, commanded by an insane US Cavalry captain possessed by the malevolent virus. Time for Sister Chantal to get busy.  <br /> <br />***** If you have ever read any comics in the \\"Magdalena\\" series (Top Cow Comics), you may very well see a resemblance. Chantal comes across as half Nun and half Valkyrie, but totally deadly. The author gives a brief look at Chantal's history, which makes the character a little more believable. If this series takes off, it could make for a great movie on the big screen someday. Terrific book! *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-10-03

Everyone believed that either her mean brother, Jason, killed her or her abusive/alcoholic mother, Billie, did. However, no body or proof was ever found. Shortly thereafter, Jason disappeared too.  <br /> <br />Twenty years later Lorna returns to Callen, Pennsylvania. Her siblings have lives elsewhere. Lorna has no husband or children and can take her business with her anywhere, compliments of her computer and being self employed. So when Lorna's mother dies, she is the logical choice to appraise the house, the contents, and all the land before selling everything. Things get complicated when Jason's remains are excavated from some land Lorna's mother had sold off a year or so ago. The local law has only circumstantial evidence and old rumors that point to Billie as the killer. But that does not keep them from arresting Billie. Then several more bodily remains of boys show up buried on that partial of land. Did Billie kill them all? Or is there a serial killer nearby?  <br /> <br />Lorna is a lot like her mother and refuses to simply assume Billie is guilty of murdering one or both of her kids, not to mention several other unknown boys. So she hires T.J. Dawson, former FBI profiler and P.I., to investigate the matter. Needless to say, the killer is not happy with Lorna.  <br /> <br />*** Not much suspense or tension in this story, but still well done and worth your time to read.

Pauline Sokol is a burned-out registered nurse. [In the first book of this series] Pauline leaves nursing and becomes an insurance fraud investigator for Scarpello & Tonelli Insurance Company.  <br /> <br />Pauline should have known something was up when Jagger shows up at her parents' house for her birthday party. Jagger says all he needs her to do is help him escort a lady to the Cortona Institute of Life, a mental institution run by nuns. By coincidence, her boss has given her a third case. This one is for psychiatric fraud. So Pauline now has two psychiatric cases at the same time.  <br /> <br />It all goes down hill and Pauline is the one committed, unwillingly, to the institution. Even her attractive sometime-cohort Jagger refuses to help get her out. No one believes that she really sane and a mistake has been made. Since she is there anyway, Pauline begins doing what she does best, snooping. Turns out that she is not the only one that has been kidnapped and committed. A huge scam is going on and she is in WAY over her head.  <br /> <br />When the first body shows up, Jagger wants Pauline out. However, Pauline now refuses to leave.

Nona has sort of adopted Dominic and is helping him understand his abilities.  <br /> <br />When Nona becomes ill, Sabine is desperate to help her.

The cure, an herbal potion, has been written down within an old book and has been past down from mother to daughter. However, the death of Nona's great-great-grandmother (Agnes) caused it to disappear. Agnes had four daughters but they ended up being separated. Each daughter kept a charm from Agnes.

She is asked to hunt for a girl who is under age and determined to be changed.<br /><br />Charlaine Harris, my personal favorite vampire series author, gives us a short story involving the characters from her SOUTHERN VAMPIRE series. Sookie Stackhouse has inherited a legacy from an out of touch vampire kin. Bubba (we all know who this famous, supposedly deceased, rock star is since people still claim to have sightings of him) and Bill are the two vampires helping out in this tale.<br /><br />Then comes Mary Janice Davidson's Dr. Sophie character. She may be a vampire, but she is also a vet. She protects the people in her area AND cares for their animals. If ever there was a good vampire, Dr. Sophie is it.<br /><br />Next up is Angela Knight whose character is a witch who must team up with THE Sir Galahad (vampire) and enter a horrible super natural battle.<br /><br />Last, but not least, is Vickie Taylor's enthralling tale of a man whose invention of synthetic blood, to help millions of humans, is stolen by a strong and nasty vampire. The human man needs to be changed into a vampire in order to get his formula back. He ends up joining with an unwilling female vampire and starting a vampire revolution.<br /><br />**** Five authors of five vampire series have gotten together to create short stories, spin offs of their own series. I give a glimpse of each story in my synopsis. I purchased this book solely for Charlaine Harris's story. I L-O-V-E her SOUTHERN VAMPIRE series!

He believes she is crazy and is about to try to arrest her when the dead bodies begin coming to life. Mignon ends up saving his life from the new vampires Charles had made that day. Mignon tries to enchant Ryan into forgetting everything, but he is a rare type of mortal that is immune to vampire enchantments. Of course, Ryan cannot tell his boss the truth of what happened in the morgue that night. So Ryan lets his boss think he was sloppy in his job that night. But Ryan refuses to just forget all he has seen. He shows up at the home of Lucas Du Plessis, a descendantof Mignon. Surprisingly, Lucas has been expecting Ryan and escorts him to Mignon. Ryan and Mignon are attracted to each other, yet neither trusts the other either. Ryan cannot arrest Mignon for killing someone who is already dead and the stories Mignon is filling his head with are straight out of a \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" show. It is all unbelievable ... at least it was until he began to see it all for himself.  <br /> <br />Mignon and her two partners begin teaching Ryan to fight with blade weapons. The only way to convince Ryan that what they say is true, is to show it to him and let him experience it all himself. The Praetorium rule is to kill any mortal immune to enchantment in order to protect the brethren. Yet Mignon finds herself reluctant to kill Ryan. He is not evil. In a way, they are on the same side, the side of Justice. So Mignon teaches Ryan. Once Charles has been taken care of she can decide whether to kill Ryan or not.  <br /> <br />Things become much more complicated when a secret branch of the U.S. Department of Defense begins popping up. They are after Charles, but once they learn of Mignon they decide to capture her too. They call themselves \\"The Vamp Squad\\". They plan to recruit vampires into becoming a special military group that would deal with terrorism. All the Vamp Squad members are immune to vampire enchantments. One member, Ursula Carlson, is undercover in the NOPD. She is pretending to be with the FBI and out to help Ryan with his case.  <br /> <br />***** If you love dark romance blended together with vampires, then this book has been taylor made just for you! Author J.M. Jeffries is a team of two authors who have proven themselves to be dark masters of the underworld. Do not let the cover fool you. No matter what race or background you are, you will find yourself sucked into this story and engrossed in the believable tale that will weave itself before your eyes. Mignon is a lady that you cannot help but cheer on as she fights for what is right.

Rumor has it that the people who actually choose to live on the Florida Keys are strange. Some are experts in scuba diving [...]. Some are experts in shark repelling suits (chain mail). But Tara Cole is an expert in revenge. [...] People all over the nation must love getting revenge on others, because Tara's business is booming. Tara is even considering accepting Howard Payne's (A.K.A. Muffin) business proposal. Revenge Gifts also gets more than its share of hate mail. Too bad Tara does not have time to read them. She is busy keeping her home's food poltergeist from throwing too many eggs around in the kitchen and her Uncle Lester's ghost from shooing away guests or turning on ALL the lights when she is trying to sleep.     But now someone has put a curse on her. Gris-gris bags, a black cat, a black rooster, even a black goat are showing up. Each is followed by bad events. A voodoo gauntlet has been stuck in the sand and Tara must accept the challenge before she ends up dead.     ***** This is one of the most amusing novels I have read this year! Tara has a most unique outlook on life that almost convinced me to join her for a walk on the dark side! This modern contemporary romance adds just enough of the paranormal element to make the characters' lives interesting to those of us forced to live in reality. \\"Revenge Gifts\\" will win awards, mark my words.

Each man has chip implants so Lloyd Ryker can track them and monitor their body functions. The men share special genetic technology, still experimental. The nanotech and bio-enhancements enable them to accomplish impossible tactical work under deadly fire. Each member has particular specialties. One member, Gabriel Enrique Cruz, mastered the ability to control animals. He was receiving new training when his mind snapped. Cruz went rogue. Then the worst possible thing happened, Cruz escaped. <br />Inside their individual containment units, Lt. Trace O'Halloran was the first to realize something was wrong. Trace's special ability allows him to set energy nets and carry out controlled psi sweeps with his mind rather than eyes. Trace alerted his commander, Wolfe Houston, via mind link. Trace's sweep informed him that Cruz was causing the chaos. This surprises Trace and Wolfe because Cruz supposedly died over a year ago. Trace's sweep is confirmed when Lloyd Ryker pulls them out of their containment units. Only a member of Foxfire could hope to hunt down another member. Trace cannot be on this mission because his sister, Kit, is involved. So Ryker sends Wolfe in alone. <br />Cruz's target is in New Mexico. Kit O'Halloran is a civilian dog trainer. Kit has eleven years experience training service dogs for law enforcement and military units. Her success rate is unmatched. Currently, she has four dogs undergoing training. Kit has no clue that these dogs are special. She has never even heard of Project Home Run. And she has no idea of the genetic technology within the dogs. These four black Labrador puppies are a team in every meaning of the word. The runt, Baby, is the obvious leader. Diesel, Butch, Sundance, and Baby can communicate with each other, plan and execute strategies together, and sense things other animals could not. Cruz intends to get his hands on Kit and the dogs no matter what it takes. <br />Wolfe is just as determined to protect them from Cruz. Like Cruz, Wolfe has a way with animals. Wolfe's ability with animals is not as good as Cruz's though. Wolfe can also create image displacements, meaning he can cast illusions and alter the memories of others. Since Kit already knew Wolfe, it made him the perfect choice to protect them. Wolfe must not reveal too much to Kit about the himself or the dogs while protecting them. At the same time, he must locate Cruz and bring him in. It should not be too difficult for Wolfe, except that Kit is no longer the same girl he knew. She has grown up and is now a huge distraction. <br />***** Author Christina Skye continues her stories of battle-honed Navy SEAL members ... and this one is the best to date! Foxfire is the team sent in when all the other elite teams fail, so you can only imagine the potential waiting for Skye to access. The possibilities are unlimited.

Though husband and wife, the love they felt for each other was more like father and daughter. Still they had intimate relations in hopes of begetting an heir. As the story opens, Edmond is dying and his cruel brother, Sir Osgood, is to inherit everything. This will leave Mariah homeless, unless she agrees to wed Osgood's son, Walter, who is as mean as his sire. <br />Fate steps in as Sir Falcon of Gaveston is brought to Castle Mildenhall for aid. Falcon is a knight of King Henry. He had been ambushed by a band of brigades. When Falcon regains consciousness, he has amnesia. Edmond convinces Mariah to pretend they are father and daughter. She is to seduce the unknown knight and get with child. In this manner, all would believe Edmond was the father and Mariah would keep her home. <br />Five years later, Sir Falcon is summoned by the king. Mariah is but a fond memory to Falcon. The kings sends Falcon back to Mildenhall as his surrogate. Sir Osgood Fitzhugh and Walter doubt the legitimacy of Robbie, Mariah's son. Worse, Osgood and Walter have taken up residence in Mildenhall, claiming to be Lord Edmond's legal heir. While there, they are pushing Mariah to marry Walter. Falcon's task is to decide whether Robbie is to be declared heir or Osgood. <br />When Falcon arrives at the door, Mariah knows that he will learn that she had been Edmond's wife, instead of daughter, all those years ago.

By luck, her brand new assistant, Emily Kim, is a miracle and helps keep Ana sane and the work flowing smoothly. Emily's best friend is a male Omorr (insect-like race) named Hkyrim.

Freeman Mills is diagnosed with rapid-cycle manic depression (bipolar) with suicidal tendencies, kleptomania, antisocial behavior, cyclothymia, and mid schizophrenia. As long as Freeman can remember, his dad had used him as a guinea pig for experiments. Dr. Kenneth Mills (a.k.a. \\"Dad\\") was once an esteemed clinical psychologist. Then Freeman's mom was killed and Dad was locked in an insane institution. However, the damages to Freeman were already done and ran deep. But that was years ago. That is all in the past. Now Freeman is twelve-years-old and has just been transferred to yet another group home. <br />Wendover Home is located in the Southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. The Wendover Home, itself, has a long and dark history. During the Second World War it had been a state mental hospital where inhumane experiments were conducted on mentally unstable patients. Many people died within cells located in the Home's basement. Though the Home is now used as a group home for children, the basement cells remain. Some items have also been added within the basement. There are glowing generators, metal cylinders, Liquid Nitrogen, advanced superconductors, and so much more. All of it is hooked directly to Room Thirteen above. <br />Dr. Richard Kracowski treats the children in Wendover Home. Room Thirteen is where Dr. Kracowski gets to play God. The doctor calls the electroshock treatments \\"Synaptic Synergy Therapy\\". He kills his patients to help their brains align harmonically. When the children come back to life they find themselves altered. For a temporary time the kids have telepathy, clairvoyance, and/or precognition abilities. After each treatment, the abilities last longer. <br />Freeman finds an unlikely ally in another child named Vicky Barnwell. Other than Freeman, Vicky's powers are the greatest. As the two warily learn about each other, they begin noticing new oddities around Wendover. The experiments in Room Thirteen have awaken those in the basementfrom their eternal rests. Being covered up long ago and forgotten are returning. <br />***** Author Scott Nicholson has become my favorite writer of the Horror genre. No one else can quite resurrect horrors that will haunt your dreams for years to come. Scott Nicholson is simply unforgettable. Don't believe me? Pick up a copy of this novel. I dare you!

It is the well known name for \\"Made in the USA\\" office furniture. It is the largest employer in Portland. While the company ran smoothly, Nick was the most admired man in town. However, Nick became the most hated man when Boston forced him to lay off thousands. Everybody in town had at least one close relative that Nick had laid off. Everywhere he went, the locals made sure to remind him of their hatred.  <br /> <br />When a stalker begins breaking into his home and vandalizing, the local police take their time in showing up. The police do not even pretend to collect evidence or care. Nick is a single father with two kids. So when the stalker becomes violent, Nick has some top grade security devices installed. Needless-to-say, when the alarms go off, Nick protects his family. After all, the police would not show up until it was WAY too late. Though it was self-defense, Nick knows the cops would enjoy slapping a murder label on him and hauling him off to prison. Therefore, Nick calls Eddie Rinaldi, Stratton's corporate security director, and ex-cop, who had installed Nick's home security devices. Eddie makes it all disappear.  <br /> <br />At work, Nick realizes that he is not being informed about major company decisions. Nick and Eddie quietly investigate and begins to uncover a conspiracy against Nick that involves some of his closest colleagues. Nothing is making sense and everyone is lying to him.  <br /> <br />Enter Homicide Detective Audrey \\"Aud\\" Rhimes. She has been paired with the loathsome and slovenly Roy Bugbee to investigate a body found in a dumpster on the wrong side of town. Clues are few, but Audrey keeps coming back to Nick as her main suspect. Her gut instinct insists that Nick knows something and is holding back evidence. When she learns of the previous break-ins and the department's numerous negligences about them, Aud cannot blame Nick for his silence. But she is determined to uncover the truth.  <br /> <br />***** This author is every bit as good as John Grisham. This is a thick novel with unexpected twists throughout most of it. Readers can easily empathize with Nick. I found myself believing that I would have done exactly as Nick did, every step of the way. This novel starts out exciting and ends up with a huge climax.

Criminal Court Judge Carole Cranston hates the battered-women cases the most. She chose her career in hopes of putting the abusive men in prison and off the streets. Yet far too often Carole can do nothing but watch as the guilty men go free due to a plea-bargain, hung jury, or some sort of small technicality. But that did not make her resort to becoming a vigilante. Or did it?  <br /> <br />Detective Sergeant Ray Barkley and his partner, Detective Nina Preston, are the ones on the Vigilante Killer case that is getting so much media coverage. Seems that there is a serial killer, possibly female, on the loose. She targets abusive men who escape the justice system. As bodies pile up, the few clues they have point the finger at Judge Carole Cranston. All the murdered men had been in her court room. They all walked free. And the women abused had all spent some time in the Rose City Women's Shelter, where Carole donates a lot of money. Nina has no doubt that Carole is guilty and is doing all she can to prove it. That is hard to do without hurting Ray, who is very attracted to Her Honor. It causes tension between the two partners as well, because Ray is just as positive that Carole is innocent. In fact, Ray and Carole begin seeing each other, even though it is NOT a good idea.  <br /> <br />**** I am lucky enough to be able to state that in my personal life almost half the people I know are black, almost half are white, and there are a few numbers of other races. So I am used to hearing titles such as \\"brother, sister, dude, amigo, man, guy\\" and the likes every day. When I read a book where most, if not all, the characters are African-American it does not surprise me to read \\"brother\\" or \\"sister\\" in it. It seldom even registers to my brain. However, in my opinion, those two titles are use far too frequently. I felt as if they were being used on every second or third page. It seemed unrealistic and became frustrating.  <br /> <br />As for the story plot, characters, and suspense, R. Barri Flowers proves, once again, that he chose the right career. This author weaves a magical web, as well as, a tangled one. The clues are all there, but even toward the end I could not be positive that I had tagged the right culprit. I will be recommending this title to many! One last thing, if you hate to be left hanging do NOT read the last page or two. This is a stand alone story. The author wraps up the mystery thriller beautifully. But the last couple of pages begins with the killer of the next novel kidnapping his first victim. I was left feeling incomplete. ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-08-19

In a previous novel, readers learned that the Havenites believed the Manties, during a cease-fire, altered documents. Therefore, the Havenites fired the first shot, ending the cease-fire without even bothering to notify the Manties. Now the Havenites have reason to believe that the Manties never altered anything. In fact, it appears that one of their own did the altering, hoping to cause the war to continue ... and succeeded. <br />Haven President Eloise Pritchart wants nothing more than for the war to end. She releases a POW, who happens to be close to Honor Harrington, with a message for Queen Elizabeth. Eloise wants to meet and discuss terms for peace. Elizabeth is given the choice of when and where. Eloise asks that Honor be included, as well as, the treecats. <br />Honor Harrington is still close to Hamish and Emily (of White Haven). As Honor begins her return to the front, she learns that she is pregnant. Though all know, in the back of their minds anyway, who the father is, no one dares state it aloud. Since being killed in battle is always a possibility, Honor has her unborn child removed from herself and placed in a tube to mature. (Totally safe.) Those on Manticore and Grayson, depending on how they feel about Honor, are either thrilled to learn about an heir or furious and wanting to use the child as a weapon against the mother. <br />***** First off let me state that I hope the author creates a whole new series about Torch, its teenaged queen, and its Amazonian people. Such potential exists there. Queen Berry Zilwicki came across much better than Queen Amidala could ever hope to have done. <br />Honor Harrington is something of \\"a personal bogeyman\\" for the Havenites. As always, Honor's reputation for unusual strategies grows, with great reason. If a student is only as good as his or her teacher, then the author, David Weber, is down right scary! The planning, tactical details, and battle executions are unnerving to me. I totally believe Weber to be a genius in this regard. <br />As my husband or I read ANY book by Weber, we lose a lot of sleep. We no longer bother to inform the other of WHY we look so tired and exhausted. We simply look into the eyes of the other and say, with a voice of pure disgust, \\" Weber Evil.\\" Those two words say it all. This series has my highest possible recommendation! ***** <br />(...)	2005-08-18

In December 2002, FBI Agent Shields had completed his mission in Santa Estela, Central America. He was on the docks, en route to the boat that would begin his journey back to the States, when he stumbled upon men and vehicles in the process of buying children. It was a child-slave trade obviously. As Shields pondered what he should do, his cousin (another agent) appeared and informed him that the child-slave ring would end that very night. Shields met his boat contact and went home, secure in the knowledge that his cousin's team would save the children.  <br /> <br />Dr. Anne McCall, FBI Profiler, had been engaged to Dylan Shields two years ago. But Dylan had been killed in an undercover drug deal gone bad. The Shields clan still considered Annie to be one of their own though. The entire clan was either in the FBI or retired from it. Annie knows she is lucky. Not only does she have the deep affection of the entire Shield family, but she also has found love a second time in the form of Homicide Detective Evan Crosby.  <br /> <br />Annie and Evan attend the wedding of Mara, Annie's sister, to Aiden Shields. It is there that Evan realizes the relationship between Annie and himself could go no further until Dylan's death is put to rest. Evan offers to look into Dylan's case, as a fresh set of eyes, with Annie. It is something the couple plan to do together, as time permits. Evan's primary focus is on a serial killer. Pre-teen girls were being targeted. Some of the victims have a tattoo. Those with the tattoo have no ID and no one has filed missing reports on them. As Annie and Evan investigate the serial killer and Dylan's death, coincidences begin showing. Then people with possible leads begin to die. As both cases begin to make even a little bit of sense, Annie realizes that she may be walking around with a target on her back.  <br /> <br />**** This is the fourth and last novel in the \\"Dead\\" series. Fans of the CSI television series will adore this book as the two main characters work through all the evidence. The plot is complex and will keep your mind working as you follow along. If you have read the other books of the series, you will see familiar names and faces. By using past characters in secondary roles this time around, the author has made the story seem more realistic. Excellent series that I highly recommend to all. ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-08-12

Captain Maneka Trevor, of the Dinochrome Brigade, is one of the few to have survived the horrible battle on the planet Chartres. Though still active military, she carries guilt of surviving when her Bolo \\"Benjy\\" and the others in her brigade did not. Maneka is surprised to find herself before Rear Admiral Sedgewood until she learns why she was summoned. Maneka has been chosen to be part of a special mission called \\"Operation Seed Corn\\". The Melconian Empire is winning the war. The Humans are losing. Those chosen for this special mission are to travel far away, find a new habitual planet, and begin a new human colony. <br />Commodore Lakshmaniah was to be in charge. However, when the Puppies arrive she and her people go out to meet them head on, in hopes of keeping them away from the transports and industrial ships. They mostly succeed. Both teams seem to wipe each other out. Yet some of the \\"Seed Corn\\" convoy is also destroyed. Maneka and Lazarus, the Bolo who is assigned to her and was also at Chartres, are now in charge. Commodore Lakshmaniah, before her death, had believed there was at least one Puppy ship under stealth somewhere. Though Maneka prays the info is incorrect, she takes all precautions. (The reader knows from the beginning that Lakshmaniah's info IS correct. The stealth ship shadows the convoy until, over a year later, a new planet is found by the Humans.) <br />The new planet is named \\"Indrani\\". As the humans settle in, the Melconians prepare to attack. They intend to wipe out the human race and take the human's higher tech equipment as their own. Only two Bolos stand in the way of the overwhelming number of Melconian troops. <br />**** This is David Weber's second Bolo novel. The first is compiled out of several stories, like an anthology where the stories all link together eventually. This novel, however, is one long story. The author, David Weber, is famous for having complex tactical strategies in his works. This book is no different. The readers get to see the tactical equations taken by the Humans AND the Puppies. Many of these are utterly brilliant! All-in-all, another winner for Weber. I look forward to his next release, which is to be another \\"Honor Harrington\\" novel (due out in October 2005.) Stellar reading here! **** <br />(...)	2005-08-08

He resides in California, but his \\"office\\" is at his home. His \\"home\\" is currently in one of the condos ringing the golf course of the Coral Canyon Country Club. (Free perk due to his side job as their assistant tennis pro.) Toby is one of the rare lawyers that are actually out to help people, rather than to fatten his own wallet. His specialty is adoption.  <br /> <br />Brogan Barlow and Rita MacGilroy are famous movie stars. Toby and Brogan were geeks (friends) together in high school. So to Toby, Brogan and Rita were just great friends who wanted to adopt a baby. All seems to be going pretty much normal. But the birth mother gives birth without going to the hospital. No one thinks too much about it though, because the birth mother hands over the baby girl to the happy new parents.  <br /> <br />The birth mother has a time limit, during which she may change her mind about giving her baby up for adoption. One day after this date, Brogan and Rita are celebrating with Toby and some friends when a call comes in that will rock their foundation. In result to the call, the new parents and Toby rush to question the birth mother only to find her gone. Brogan and Toby begin to search for answers to some hard hitting questions. Problem is that the people they need to speak with either do not exist or are turning up dead.  <br /> <br />***** I cannot tell more without giving away spoilers, which I refuse to do. The phone call is the turning point, where the reader finds out exactly WHAT the mystery is. However, if you want to figure out the \\"who\\" and \\"why\\" you will have to pay attention from the very first page. This may be Randall Hicks's first mystery novel, but he wrote about something he knows well, adoption. This gives the mystery a much greater depth and makes it all very realistic. While you find yourself putting together clues with the main characters, you will also find yourself very entertained. Much humor to lighten things up a bit. The result is a wonderful novel that you end up reading more than once. Excellent! *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews. <br />	2005-08-08

To prove themselves worthy, each member must succeed in a project, invention, or some type of major scientific break through before age thirty. Tru is now twenty-nine. She has less than a year to earn her Charter or she would be disassociated from her home planet. Tru decides to locate the legendary lost Curzon Collection. She has only a small plate to help her. But the plate is a key. She needs to locate three unknown pyramids, built centuries ago, on three unknown planets. The plate must be set on top of each pyramid in order to complete the plate's map. Then she must use the plate to locate and retrieve the Collection. However, the Majj are not allowed to leave their planet. Their own administrators keep them grounded. With the help of her mentor and only real friend, Noa, Tru gets off world and goes to hire the man best suited for the retrieval job.  <br /> <br />Rayce Coburne is building a deluxe spaceport, due for its grand opening in less than three months. Due to lack of funds, things are not going well. Then Tru shows up and offers him all the funds he would ever need, for a simple mission. Rayce would have refused instantly if his partner, Gil, had not forced him to be realistic. Rayce hates all Majj, for very personal reasons.

But Detlef von Tennen believes that those false charges are not the real reason Ruth is in such danger. Since Detlef is canon, and the cousin of the Archbishop, he joins the investigation.  <br /> <br />*** The plot and cast of character in this novel are too complex for me to write a thorough synopsis.

She is efficient in archery, blade throwing, some hand-to-hand combat, and training animals. Her people affectionately call her their \\"Warrior Woman - the Pride of Blackthorn\\". Meghan knew that there was some bad tidings between Rolf and Connor, but no one ever told her what happened to cause the feud.  <br /> <br />Meghan sneaks away from her brother and her laird for some time alone hunting.

He has proof showing that Connor was the one who led the raid two years ago. During that raid Connor hilled Rolf's wife and new born son. It is only fitting that Rolf uses Meghan for his revenge.

They are attracted to each other and meet occasionally simply to chat. Amy, however, is stalked by an abusive ex-boyfriend named Jason. Jason not only physically abuses Amy for any imagined slight, but is constantly calling her on the cell phone to argue over nothing and force her to pay HIS bills.  <br /> <br />Chad ends up dying when he over exerts himself jogging. In his afterlife, Chad meets Adam who will guide and teach him all he needs to know. As Chad learns from Adam, he keeps a watch over his mother and Amy.  <br /> <br />**** This is a very short story, around 70 pages long. The author focuses on how one's actions can cause consequences, be they good or bad. Yet, the story also shows the signs of controlling boyfriends (or girlfriends). There are several other lessons as well, hidden within an imaginative love story set between \\"life\\" and the \\"after life\\".  <br /> <br />This book will be available through the publishing company (link attached) and through B&N and Amazon. Be warned that there is graphic violence that would rate a PG-13 if it was to be shown on television or at a movie theater. So keep the younger kids away. However, anyone age 13 or above should be mature enough to handle the content. Wonderful tale that will grab your imagination and let it soar! The only way the story could have been better was if it had been longer.

With it, the chances of success are still slim, but it is better than nothing. If they fail, millions will die.  <br /> <br />***** There is not really much romance at all in this Romantic Suspense. The two main characters are attracted to each other, but by the end of the story I, as the reader, did not feel that they could possibly be in true love. Most of the novel is dedicated to capturing Taylor and convincing her to help. The author did an excellent job on that, as well as, on the seven levels.

Maria Hallett was a wild fifteen year old that lived in Yarmouth, Massachusetts (Cape Cod), in the year 1713. While her huge family slept, she would dash into town to spend a few hours at Crosby Tavern. There, Maria would flirt and tease all the customers, but never went to bed with any of them. Until Sam Bellamy. Sam and Maria spent one night together while a storm raged outside. Sam was a sailor with nothing to his name. He told Maria to wait for him. He would return for her as soon as he made his fortune from the sea. To do this, Sam became a pirate.<br /><br />Dr. Angus McPherson is an obstetrician living in Brewster, in the year 1992. As a violent storm rages outside, one of his patients calls to inform him that she has gone into labor. \\"Dr. Angus\\" began his trip to the hospital. However, en route he spies a man, running toward his car from a pasture, frantically waving him down. Angus braves the storm to meet the man half way. John Hallett begs Angus to help his daughter, Maria, who is at his home in the middle of a difficult delivery. Knowing his other patient would be fine, Angus agrees. In no time at all, Dr. Angus realizes he has crossed an invisible barrier and entered the past. He saves Maria's life, and that of her baby boy. Yet before he could leave to recross the pasture and return to 1992, he learns that a council meeting was forming to declare Maria a witch and to kill her. Angus can't explain the strong feelings he has for Maria after such a brief time, but to save her again Angus decides to remain in 1713 and marry her.<br /><br />Maria marries the doctor to save herself, but fully expects to leave him when Black Sam finally returns for her. Angus is just as determined to earn Maria's love, so she would never leave him. The town quickly trusts the new doctor in their area. Learning to trust Maria, an accused witch, is harder. And Maria wasn't really doing anything to help matters. Maria may only be around the age of sixteen, but she is going to have to mature quickly if she ever hopes to be truly happy.<br /><br />**** I found the character of Maria to be extremely vexing, to say the least. Yet considering her age, I think the author made her maturity level realistic. The doctor's character is extremely well done! Most of this story comes from his point of view. As for the people of Yarmouth and its surrounding area, they gave this story a bonus touch. The author took the time to let me, as the reader, understand them and their beliefs. All-in-all, this romance is refreshing and perfect for a beach read or while you are outside enjoying the sunshine.<br /><br />This is Maria and Dr. Angus's story. I understand that Sam has his own story in the next episode \\"Port Call To The Future\\". If it turns out to be as interesting as this story, I will be very happy. We shall soon see. ****<br /><br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-07-15

Taylor may be white, but he was adopted by a Native American couple and learned to live in both worlds. His adopted parents died of poisoning at their old housing unit, Kickingbird. They were not the only ones who expired either. The authorities never found out the cause. Everyone was moved out and now reside at Redtree. Oddly enough, the events of Kickingbird are starting all over again at Redtree. Natives are getting poisoned and some are near death. And everyone KNOWS that the authorities will, once again, do nothing.<br /><br />Taylor and his two friends, Elijah and Keith, have become vigilantes. They know the names of the powerful men behind it all. The trio, with Chief Campanow as their spiritual guide, are hunting them down one-by-one for execution.<br /><br />The banker, Gayland, is to be the last man taken down. The last one so he can worry and sweat the most. He is also the boss of Wendy, Taylor's fianc&eacute;. Wendy knows nothing about the shady dealing of Gayland or what Taylor is doing. Wendy only knows that her boss is acting strange and making moves on her. Worse still, she is being stalked by one of Gayland's acquaintances. Taylor is about to up the ante.<br /><br />*** On the whole, I found this to be a pretty good novel. But I found some things to be unbelievable. The smart detective in the story (and all his cop associates) kept saying that whoever was killing the powerful men must be professionals, because zero clues are ever left behind. They totally dismiss the dozens of shells and ammunition casings as clues. When one of the vigilante trio is hurt and bleeding badly, he has little trouble dealing with the pain, getting all his blood (DNA) up from the murder scene (though he is still bleeding), and never gets medical attention from any true medical person. As for Wendy, she is the only sane one in the group, in my opinion. Yet even she is too good to be true. She has been groped by her boss, stalked by a hitman, had her apartment broken into,and KNOWS that Taylor understands everything that is happening and why. Still, she simply accepts it when Taylor says he'll deal with it and refuses to tell her what's going on.<br /><br />I am not a Crime Scene Investigator, detective of any kind, or very knowledgeable in law and politics. However, several things do not ring true to me. Yet for some reason, I could not stop reading. The premise of the plot and the need for closure among the people involved kept me enthralled. The author clearly got a message through to me, the reader. That message is that those people with money and/or power can bribe law enforcements to look away, leaving them free to do anything to anyone or any community. It also told me that if the law does not protect its people, the people will no longer respect the law and deal with problems their own way. All-in-all, a good read. ***<br /><br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-07-15

She had been immortalized as the Goddess Kiasidira!  <br /> <br />Admiral Rynan \\"Mack\\" Makarian commanded the space station Cirrus One and was dead of the critical Rim Gate Project. He soon realized Gillie was his destiny, his soulmate. He knew Gillie kept many secrets, by omissions, from everyone and that miracles often happened whenever she was around, but he was positive she would reveal all sooner or later.  <br /> <br />Gillie kept her true identity and Raheiran abilities a close secret. To reveal the truth would destroy the Khalaran society that had already raised generations on her little aphorisms.

There was simply not enough bottles of Devil's Breath in the station's bars to help her get through it all!  <br /> <br />***** Simon is short for \\"Sentient Integrated MObile Nanoessence\\". Via telepathy, one of several abilities she has, Gillie and Simon communicate. As you can see, most of this novel is Sci-Fi. However, the author makes the story more intriguing by adding several touches of Fantasy elements such as a mageline sorceress and a touch of spacestation romance. It all blends together to make an awesome drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat and holding your breath! BRAVA! *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-07-15

The story begins with the murder of an old man, former Senator Andrew Jackson Quintrell III. No one really cared that he died. Everyone in the area knew the dirty old man had been a philanderer his entire life. If it was a human female, between the ages of puberty and menopause, the would bed her, even against her will. Back in his glory years people kept silent about such things. After all, he was a powerful man in New Mexico. The voting public would never believe a bad word against such a powerful and upstanding citizen.  <br /> <br />Governor Josh Quintrell was the old man's son. Josh could care less that the old man was dead. Josh had his eyes on the White House. All he had to do was keep his family's dirty laundry hidden from the voting public for eleven more months. Then he could sell the ranch that had been in his family for centuries and stick his ailing mother, Sylvia, in a nursing home somewhere. Sylvia had not spoken to anyone or acknowledged her surroundings since the 1960s. She would never even realize that she was no longer on the ranch.  <br /> <br />Winifred Simmons y Castillo was Josh's aunt, Sylvia's sister. Winifred was glad the dirty old man was dead. He never really cared for his ailing wife anyway. Winifred stayed by her sister's side, willing her to live each day. Winifred hired Carolina \\"Carly\\" May to write the Castillo family history. She was the last of the Castillo line. It was time to put their history into print for all the world to know. It was time to get vengeance for Sylvia's sake.  <br /> <br />Carly loved genealogy. Perhaps it was because she was adopted, her file sealed, and she had no way to know her own biological family history. This time the family she wrote about was famous. Carly felt honored to be doing the Castillo-Quintrell family history. But no one in town wanted Carly to dig into the past. All of them had dark secrets. Many warned her to quit and leave. Help came in the form of mysterious Daniel \\"Dan\\" Duran, who was tight lipped about his occupation. All he would tell her is that he was on vacation for a few months. Dan had grown up in the area. He knew a lot about the families Carly was working on. He also knew that most of the locals were, in some way, related to the former Senator. Someone wanted the Senator's secrets to die quietly, just like the dirty old man had. Dan was determined to keep Carly alive.  <br /> <br />**** This is a intriguing story filled with danger, suspense, and just a touch of romance. People interested in learning a bit about genealogy, how to find relatives via DNA samples, or how to figure out the dates of old photos will enjoy the details that the author goes into. If you are in no way interested in such things, you may find yourself skimming areas of the book because the author included a lot of her research on the subjects. This makes the story even more realistic to the readers. So does all the information the author added about the history of New Mexico. At some parts of the story I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat, trying to figure out who did what, when, and why, as if it was a CSI television episode. Author Elizabeth Lowell has a new fan in me! ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-07-12

Oh, he had to abuse her sometimes, but he figured he was simply using \\"tough love\\". Though they never married, Manuel knew he could always use their six-year-old boy to manipulate her into whatever he wanted. He never expected her to have the guts to PLAN an escape from him, much less succeed. But he would find her. She could not have much money. Once he got her back, she'd pay big time. She would never even THINK of running off again.  <br /> <br />Vanessa had ID in the name of Emma Wright. Her son was now called Max. With luck, they could reach Iowa to live a nice, quiet life there. Even as Emma prayed that would happen, she knew Manuel was hot on her trail.  <br /> <br />Preston Holman was hunting down the man he believed killed his son. He had only to find proof. When he met Emma he wanted nothing to do with her. Her son, Max, reminded him too much of his own son. But he knew they were desperate, running from something or someone, and he could not abandon them. He vowed to keep an emotional distance from the pair, drop them off in Iowa, and forget about them. Yet his heart knew better.  <br /> <br />***** Author Brenda Novak has proven, once again, that she is one of the top suspense writers of our days. This one is a breathless romantic suspense novel that will keep her readers' attention from the first page until long after the last has been turned.

Their CD would soon hit the shelves. By the weekend, Tess should no longer have a money problem. But Tess wonders if she will live until then. She is rescued from a mugger only to be kidnapped by the man who rescued her. Could things possibly get worse? The answer is YES! The man who kidnapped her is an alien named Cohl, an extremely handsome alien at that. Even though Tess hates him for abducting her from Earth, she can't help but be attracted to him and understand why he did it.  <br /> <br />Cohlman \\"Cohl\\" Trae Salle's home planet, Yre Gault, is in another quadrant of the galaxy. His father, Montral, has been kidnapped by a group called the Traka-Nor. They live on the northern hemisphere of the planet Trakas. The Traka-Sou reside on the southern hemisphere. The two hemispheres are ruled by brothers and are at war. Rommol, the leader of the north, holds Montral ransom. Cohl must locate and collect the Demisian Amulet to be exchanged for his father. Legend states that the amulet gives the possessor the ability to control their enemy. It is hidden in a secret chamber somewhere on Demisie, a planet that supposedly did not exist. Tess's voice is needed to unlock the amulet from its chamber. Only her voice has the exact range, pitch, and quality needed for success.  <br /> <br />It all sounds bad, right? It gets worse, much worse. Cohl has yet to tell Tess who he really is and what dangers they must go through simply to reach the amulet's chamber.  <br /> <br />***** The more I read from this author, the more I love her.

But that did not stop the two from being dangerously attracted to one another. They were almost caught in a very compromising position. So they quickly parted ways, but never forgot each other.  <br /> <br />Now Julia is the fiance to Sir Russell Althorne, Heath's commanding officer. Russell is chasing Armand Auclair, a French spy that one tortured Heath to near insanity before Russell rescued him. Russell calls in the debt of honor. Heath is to protect Julia while Russell is away, in case Armand sends someone to harm her. But Heath and Julia both know that they can't be in the same room without falling into each other's arms.  <br /> <br />*** There are some very colorful secondary characters in this tale. Julia's aunt, Hermia, actually steals the show a few times! You will also get to see how Grayson and Jane (from a previous novel in the Boscastle series) is doing. As for Julia, she is a widow when she meets Heath again, no innocent miss fresh from the school room. This makes the romance between the two main characters explosive. All-in-all, this is not the best story in the Boscastle series, but well worth your time to pick up and read. ***  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-07-08

Xylara \\"Lara\\" is daughter of the late Warrior King Xyron. As such, Lara always knew her fate was a political alliance marriage. Still, Lara's interest has always been healing. Therefore, she grew up and became a Master Healer. Lara treats her people, as well as the prisoners of war. To a Healer, it did not matter if the patient is friend or foe, only that he needs wounds treated. Her half-brother, Xymund, sits on the throne and rules the Kingdom of Xy, but does not do a good job of it. The warring \\"Firelanders\\" would soon conquer Xy.  <br /> <br />Lara was shunned when she first went to aid the enemy warriors in the prison section. But after much persistence and then proving her healing abilities, the wounded warriors accepted her and looked forward to her visits. It is Lara's fighting spirit, good heart, and healing talent that changes her fate.  <br /> <br />When King Xymund and Warlord Keir meet to discuss \\"true peace\\", the Warlord demands Lara as \\"Warprize\\". Xymund swears fealty to Keir and Lara goes with Keir, not knowing what to expect. But the peace is threatened as assassination attempts are made on Lara. If the Warprize should did, the lands will run red with the blood of thousands.  <br /> <br />***** Absolutely fantastic! I lost half a night of sleep because I could not stop reading this novel. Lara and Keir will have three books. But do not worry, this book does not end and leave you hanging. (I hate it when a book does that.) This tale blends what seems to be historical romance (horses, swords, etc) with fantasy. It is obviously not something that could have ever happened on Earth; however, the book never mentions what planet it is set on. If not for the fantasy elements, you could very well believe this was set back in the days of Vikings or knights.

She very briefly worked in an antique shop for the owner, Cookie Caldwell, but was fired when she ruined Cookie's scheme to cheat a local elderly widow. Yet before the day is over Skye has anew, better paying job.  <br /> <br />Skye is the sole organizer of the First Annual Route 66 Yard Sale which covers over 100 miles. With all the recent rezoning laws, she is having a horrible time making sure all is legal and ready for the major event. Once it begins, Skye learns that yard sales bring out the worst in people. Even her own mother splats a TV celebrity, Faith Easton, in the face with a pie when the lady claims the pie not to be flaky enough. When not dealing with the huge yard sale, Skye is in the middle of a battle of the sexes among her parents, best friends, and even students.  <br /> <br />Trouble really begins when Cookie is found dead, stabbed to death by a piece of jewelry, and Faith's TV crew is filming it all live. Thanks to the rezoning, Wally, the intelligent and handsome police chief, can do nothing. Jurisdiction now falls to Sheriff Buck Peterson of Stanley County, almost an hour drive away. The sheriff is not exactly the sharpest tack in the box either, because he is trying to pin it all on Skye.  <br /> <br />***** This is the seventh book in the series. Each book stands alone as a mystery, but the highly amusing cast of characters are consistent.

They chose to live in San Diablo, California, a town famous for its holy relics.  <br /> <br />Years have passed. Allie is now fourteen-years-old with all the normal teen troubles. Eric is dead. Kate has married Stuart Connor and they have a two-year-old son, Timmy. Stuart is going to run for the County Attorney seat. Kate has a normal family in a normal town with normal suburban problems. For over fourteen years her days have been filled with diapers, bake sales, and PTA meetings. Her nights have been filled with more diapers, taxi service for Allie and her friends, and trying to be the perfect wife of a man with political aspirations. If not for her best friend and neighbor, Laura Dupont, to support her emotionally and help out with the kids, Kate would no longer have any hair to pull out. During all that time Kate has not seen, smelled, heard of, or killed any demons. NO ONE knew about her past career.

Cass had been left for dead, but amazingly survived. Craig Denver, a rookie, carried her out of that house. He became her mentor. That had been twenty-six years ago, almost to the day. <br />Now she is Detective Cassandra \\"Cass\\" Burke. She has been a copy with Bowers Inlet, New Jersey, for about ten years. Craig Denver is not the Chief of Police. It is still a small town on the shore and Cass is the only detective. She suddenly finds herself in a serial homicide investigation. The killer is sending Denver taunting notes, just as the Bayside Strangler did the former chief, twenty-odd years ago. But why would he kill so many and then disappear for so long before beginning anew? Or was it a copycat killer? There are four victims in only six days. Denver and Cass need help. John Mancini with the FBI sends Special Agent Rick Cisco to help Cass and Denver out. <br />Mancini also sends Special Agent Mitchell Peyton to the home of Regan Landry. Regan is a writer. Her father was famous for his true crime best sellers. many criminals wrote to him in hopes of being immortalized in one of his books. But he had been murdered eight months ago by Lowell (a killer in one of the \\"Dead\\" series). While going through her father's things, Regan locates files and notes about the Bayside Strangler. The killer had been in contact with Regan's father long ago. But the files and notes are scattered. With Peyton's help, perhaps they could find some clue to identify the killer currently in Bowers Inlet. <br />Time is running out. The population is about to triple due to summer renters. If the killer is not captured before then, the body count will sky rocket! <br />***** If you read Mariah Stewart's \\"Dead\\" series, then you are going to recognize a few secondary (law) characters. This makes it all more realistic to the readers. However, this novel is actually the first of the \\"Truth\\" series. So you do not need to have read any of Stewart's other books to get the full impact. And this story will feel like a sock in your gut.

Her entire family has a history of committing larceny. Her mother left when she was six. Her father, aunt, and uncle are still in prison. But Francie is determined to go straight! She has an apartment in the low rent district, she has a waitress job in a diner, and is in school working on an associate's degree. If Francie is not working, her nose is in a book studying.  <br /> <br />When Francie's parole officer retires, she is assigned to Brandon Fairchild. Unlike his predecessor, Brandon gets involved with his parolees. He insists on inspecting their homes, work places, schools (if they attend classes), as well as having them appear in his office every two weeks. However, after years of dealing with ex-cons, Brandon no longer believes most of what his parolees tell him. So when Francie shows up for her first appointment with him and claims to have found the Lord, he doesn't believe her. After all, her records clearly show that she has pulled that scam before. He challenges her to begin her transformation by trying \\"the fruit of the Spirit\\".  <br /> <br />Of course, Francie has never heard of such a fruit and her research begins. She is going to prove to Brandon that she is not pulling a con. She really HAS changed. In doing so, Francie not only changes her own life, but the lives of those around her.  <br /> <br />As for Brandon, the more he learns about Francie, the more he is surprised and impressed. An attraction grows, one that Brandon cannot ignore. Ethics state he must transfer her case to someone else. But if he does, would Francie believe it was due to something SHE had done? Would she totally lose focus and fall off track?  <br /> <br />**** This light romance clearly shows that change is possible for anyone. Francie is a wonderful role model for everyone. She is caring, hard working, and tries to see good in everyone. The character of Brandon shows that even Christians have blind spots and are never perfect. No matter how long they have been with the Lord, they will always have room to grow and lessons to learn, even from those who are new to the true path. Author Jane Myers Perrine has created a cast of loving characters that readers will easily be able to identify with and understand. Even the secondary characters have depths all their own. I found this to be a wonderful story and recommend it to all. ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-07-01

She was in charge of Emperor Thomellt's safety on board his star cruiser. When a shipment of meat arrived from Empress Lisandra, the Emperor would not let Lara examine it before rushing it off to the kitchens for cooking. Since Lara was just getting off a long shift, she went to bed rather than eat. Therefore, she was the only person aboard that did not fall prey to food poisoning. It also meant that a group of kidnappers were able to board and take the Emperor without anyone being physically able to stop them. As soon as Lara discovered the Emperor had been taken, she set off in a small ship to trail the kidnappers. She ended up being ambushed.  <br /> <br />Riley (no last name mentioned that I could find) is a former military squad leader and scout. Currently he is a space scavenger. While going through a pile of debris he has just collected, Riley comes across an unconscious Lara. Upon awakening, she immediately commandeers his ship and they are off to rescue the Emperor. Meanwhile, the Empress assumes command of the armies and is declaring war.  <br /> <br />**** I stress that this is an Erotic Sci-Fi. There are many scenes that are not suitable for anyone under the age of seventeen. Now that I have done my duty in informing you of the exotic content, let me say that this story is very good indeed! I read the book for its story, not the erotica content. (It is just an added bonus.) It starts off with action, instantly catching my interest, which is a MUST with me. If a book does not start off interesting, then I drop it and pick up one that will. The two main characters have their own personalities and quirks, so I found them to be believable. The only down thing I can say about this title is that the ending seemed a bit rushed to me. However, this is one of the better erotica books I have had the pleasure of reading. ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-06-30

Fortunately for Dora, this puts her and Zical in very close quarters for a very long time.  <br /> <br />**** Tessa and Kahn's amazing tale in the previous novel \\"The Challenge\\" had Dora as a secondary character throughout most of the story. Zical entered that adventure about half way into it. If you read the first novel then you could not help but love Dora. It never entered my mind that Dora could have her own story. Fortunately, author Susan Kearney has a more fertile imagination than I. Susan Kearney not only succeeded at giving Dora a human form, but also made her very realistic by adding a human flaw or two.  <br /> <br />In addition, a new character named Kirek is introduced. He is a four-year-old genius. I can reveal nothing else without spoilers so I will not even try. However, I have hope that Kirek will get his own story told someday. I highly recommend this title for fans of romance and sci-fi. **** <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-06-28

This time it is prescription fraud. Pauline's best suspect is Sophie Banko. To keep tabs on Sophie, Goldie helps disguise Pauline as an elderly lady. This way Pauline infiltrates the Hope Valley Senior Citizens Center to spy on Sophie. In addition to that, Pauline begins working (as a Temp) at the Hope Valley Clinic and its pharmacy.  <br /> <br />The case is a bit above what Pauline is ready for, but since Goldie has tonsillitis, she has time to help Pauline with disguises and advice. Good thing too, because Pauline needs lots of advice to deal with her two romantic interests, Nick and Jagger. Nick is clean cut, handsome, and a co-worker. Jagger is mysterious, irritating, and dangerously attractive. And it will probably take both of them to help Pauline on this case.  <br /> <br />**** The author, Lori Avocato, spends a bit more time on romance this time around. Readers get another taste of the mysterious Jagger, as well as, of the romantic Nick. But the author does not skimp on the investigation plot either. You will get to sink your teeth into another \\"whodunit\\" type mystery while being constantly amused with the colorful cast of characters that surround Pauline and her hectic life. Another delightful romp with Pauline and her unusual life style. ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-06-28

Katherine \\"Kate\\" Rochelle has been in Palm Beach's social elite since birth. She has had money all her life. For her career, she became a criminal defense attorney. Scandal hit when Kate learned her co-worker was on the take. Kate could not let such illegal matters go and dutifully turned him in. Kate is as honest as her grandfather (a judge) had been before he disappeared from his court chambers in the old courthouse over thirty years ago. However, her honesty makes the other lawyers antsy, especially those who believe Kate should have turned the other way. So Kate made her own law firm and is out to prove herself all over again. Her first case is to prove that a friend, Lloyd, did not murder Grace.     Grace Roberts had been murdered in Kate's grandfather's old chambers. Since Kate does not believe in coincidences, she begins looking into a possible connection. Kate's partners, Carling and Nicole, hire a P.I. named Gabriel \\"Gabe\\" Chavez to assist her. It does not take long for Kate to realize that her life is in danger. The evidence is beginning to look as though someone high up is the culprit. Kate's debutante skills and social connections help her get some answers. Yet only Gabe's P.I. and police skills can keep her alive.     ***** This story seems to be the first of a trilogy. At least, I hope Kate's partners each get their own stories.     What? You say that you demand lots of action? You want suspense AND some romance as well? Then pick up this novel and RUN! Otherwise, you may not get your hands on a copy. Once readers begin talking about this title it will fly off the shelves. Excellent legal and mystery drama. *****     Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-06-28

The former Nobel Prize winner is one of the most brilliant scientific people of our century. He is at the brink of completing his greatest research. However, due to his rapidly declining health there is not enough time to finish it before he dies. <br />Doctor Carl Dorning was a highly regarded neurosurgeon who had a brain storm during an operation. He resigned from his work in order to turn his time toward proving his idea. For almost twenty years Carl secretly works in his basement lab on transferring one person's memories into another person's mind. Carl finally convinces Percival, the man he respects above all others, to fund the experiments. <br />Miguel Sanchez is a homeless, pre-teen boy. His mother is recovering in a medical facility. He has no idea where his cruel father currently is. So Miguel lives on the street with a few older kids, begging cash from passing traffic. Carl convinces Miguel to live with Percival for awhile and keep the fading professor company during his last days. In return, Miguel will have a roof over his head, three meals a day, and then receive \\"the gift of truly superior intelligence\\". <br />Percival and Miguel believes Carl's experimental surgery would transfer Percival's memories into Miguel's brain. Then Miguel would either instantly gain Percival's intelligence or occasionally get flashes of the elderly man's memories. Either way, someone would always remember Percival. Carl did not bother to inform either of them that only one set of memories could exist in the boy's head. <br />As the memories and essence of an astrophysicist comes forth, all that is the boy will be lost forever. The result is a tug-of-war for ownership of an eleven-year-old's body. <br />**** A scary look at the world of science when an intelligent doctor's morals become twisted. The wish for immortality can be all consuming. Even when one knows that it is morally wrong to take without asking, especially in this manner, the temptation can still be great. Readers get a glimpse into how even the most brilliant minds alive can fear death, try to cheat it, and (hopefully) learn to let go. Do not begin this book believing that you can guess the outcome. This is a very good sci-fi that will leave you in deep thoughts long after you finish reading. **** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-06-23

When London stage actress Kate McPhee finds out that her boyfriend and best friend are in bed together, she decides to accept the role offered to her from Hollywood. Off Kate goes to begin her role as gay Detective Devon Merrick on daytime televison show \\"Live For Tomorrow\\". Devon is a police detective, a master or martial arts, a love interest for two or more men (and women), and a hard core vampire huntress!  <br /> <br />The show's wild and unpredictable producer, Daphne del Valle told Kate to \\"Sell the hut. Sell the rage. Sell the hunger. Sell the loooooove.\\" And that is exactly what Kate does! She is on her way up the escalator of fame. But even though her character on the show is gay, Kate is not in reality. Yet the public is not listening. The character, Devon, has taken a life of her own. Kate decides that what she needs is a man in her bed. But who? There is a magician, a dog with four dogs, a co-star, and no end in sight. Problem is she has no one near and dear except her cat.  <br /> <br />To make matters worse, there is the show's power-wielding dragon ... uh, diva. Meredith Contini considers herself the queen on the show and resents Kate almost from the start. Not wanting competition from Kate, Meredith begins battle plans to have the newbie fired.  <br /> <br />**** Welcome to the world of the soap opera, where characters can be killed off or scarred beyond recognition only to reappear the next season with some sort of zany or lame excuse.  <br /> <br />Finola Hughes and Digby Diehl team up to bring the Hollywood soap opera feeling to life in novel form. Now you can take a soap opera with you where ever you may go. Whether Kate's off camera life is anything like the one of a real soap star is unknown by me. But it sure is a lot of fun to read. Here you will see some of daytime's secrets in making those dramatic, pulse pounding scenes. For those of us who do not watch daytime television, pick up this novel and see how crazy the life of a TV personalitycan be. It is enough to make the Stars' pull their own hair out.

The main headquarters is on the planet called Dun Gali. Torie Masters is the youngest member of the family and the only daughter. She has grown up with more than half a dozen older brothers.  <br /> <br />As the story opens, Torrie is on her maiden voyage as captain of the ship Ventura2. The crew is evacuating. Core melt down is due shortly. Torrie stays behind, sure she can save the ship. She is wrong. However, the ship was never in danger. Pirates board.  <br /> <br />Qaade Deter lets Torie live. He is known as the Ghost Rider of the Dead Zone. All he steals from Torrie's ship are some special medical supplies. InterGlax, the law enforcement, may call him and his crew pirates, but to the slaves he rescues he is called a savior. If Torrie had not found a way to track her stolen shipment, she and Qaade would probably have never met again. But, of course, she did.  <br /> <br />Qaade and Torrie must come to an understanding and learn to trust each other ... and FAST!  <br /> <br />Qaade has a traitor somewhere in his crew. Someone Qaade trusts has given all information on the \\"Slipstream\\" operation (the name for his operation of freeing slaves) to a dangerous man named Chauvet. Chauvet knows every single thing about the operation and even has detailed maps on each ship, port of calls, and people. Chauvet has created a cold game in the name of vengeance.  <br /> <br />***** Both genders will enjoy this sci-fi flick. It is like watching Han Solo and Princess Leia go head-to-head. Both stubborn, both used to leadership, and both filled with honor. I read the entire book in a single sitting, unable to stop. To be honest, I did not even try to resist. I just sat back and enjoyed the ride. And what a ride this one is! There are a few hot scenes, but not like a \\"romance\\" book where it begins toward the beginning and steams all the way through the book. No, most of the time is spent on the plot. Again, thinkHan and Leia. The attraction and passion is between them, but the Rebellion is first and foremost.  <br /> <br />Author C.J. Barry has a best seller here. No doubt!

Fear of the unknown had him running away instead. Jay \\"catches out\\" on a freight train thinking he would live the romantic hobo lifestyle, foot loose, free, and no one to tell him what to do. Instead, Jay discovers constant physical dangers, the fear of being caught by train gangs or the police, hunger, and facing the elements.  <br /> <br />He joins another young man, only slightly older, who goes by the alias Liberty Two. As Jay slowly learns the life of the hobo, he does much thinking. Will he remain a hobo and merge into its hard lifestyle? Or will he return to the town he lived in and see if a foster home could give him a chance of a better life?  <br /> <br />***** This is the sequel to a previous teen novel titled \\"Me & Jay\\". You do not have to read the first to enjoy this one though. This book begins two years after the previous book ended. Watching Jay, as his travels went along, gave me a glimpse into a subculture that I never dreamed existed. This story is a real eye opener. Though the story is fiction, the names in the book are real. The author lived this life for a time (and has the scar to prove it, according to the Forward in the book).

When she sees Mr. Nicholas \\"Nick\\" Birmingham, the richest stockbroker in England, she gets an idea. The very next day, Fiona goes to Nick's office and offers to marry him in exchange for his help. It is fairly well known that Nick's deceased father had always hoped his son would make an aristocratic match. Even though Nick does not believe himself worthy of Fiona, he agrees. It does not take the pair long to fall totally in love with each other. <br />Lord Edward Warwick, the Foreign Secretary, had grown up unofficially betrothed to Fiona. Yet last year he jilted Fiona to marry another, Countess Maggie. The Crown needs the help of Nick, his brother (William), and his money. Edward goes to Nick, hoping Nick's patriotism will force his agreement. It does, but only because William has experience in stealthy dealings. If not for his loyalty to his country, Nick would have refused. Nick could not help being jealous that Fiona had once loved Edward for so long. <br />Fiona has truly gotten over Edward. She is deeply in love with Nick. She is even growing to adore Nick's illegitimate, eight-year-old daughter, Emmie. But she is jealous that Nick keeps disappearing at night and fears he is going to another woman. In addition to this, it is no secret that Randy frowns upon Fiona marrying so beneath their station. Yet Randy may soon be forced to eat crow. <br />***** You say that you want dreamy romance? Then pick up a copy of \\"One Golden Ring\\". This has got to be the most PERFECT Regency Romance that I have read this year. I actually found myself envying Fiona. You will not find any stupid characters that you will want to strangle. These characters are intelligent and realistic. I have high hopes that a couple of the secondary characters will get their own stories told someday soon. ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-06-08

She had the ranch hands charmed before she even met Travis. Lu's English was still choppy so communicating often sounded strange or funny, but the point of the conversations were easily followed. Once Lu understood she was not getting married, Travis hired her as the cook and housekeeper. That was when trouble began!  <br /> <br />Patrick was very prejudiced against Catholics like Lucia.

Instead she wished for the life of a warrior. She wanted to become one of the Sword Sisters. Already Andrixine had earned her warrior braids. Good thing, since someone was trying to kill her.  <br /> <br />Andrixine's party was traveling home from Snowy Mount Monastery when they were attacked. Andrixine was able to get her younger sister to safety, but her mother was kidnapped. She returned to the monastery for help in rescuing her mother and came face-to-face with her destiny! The magical Spirit Sword chose Andrixine to become the new Sword Bearer and lead her people in the upcoming war.  <br /> <br />Disguised as a boy and traveling with (and learning from) the previous Sword Bearer, Andrixine began to fulfill her duty to the Spirit Sword and her people.  <br /> <br />**** Now THIS is an awesome story! The author took the unlikely combination of a princess and a valkyrie and somehow managed to make it work!

Her brother had a club foot and was unable to support them with work. So Alicia agreed. For years she robbed the houses of those she came in contact with. Until Garrett announced she was to wed Lord Adam McAllister!  <br /> <br />Adam's father was dead. His mother was insane and under constant care at his home of Prospect Bluff.

Most things aboard did not operate well, if at all. They were extremely outdated, including her nav charts. Her only companion was Dezi, her DZ-9 droid that spoke too much. While settled in Avanar's infamous swamp world, a Sko ship crash-landed. Trilby decided to salvage all available in the crash for much needed cash. After all, finder's keeper's. But instead of an enemy Sko, she found a Z'fharin. Trilby and Dezi patched him up, intending to continue to Port Rumor (her home world) for a pick up of cargo. It was not to be.  <br /> <br />He was THE Senior Captain T'vahr! Known by many less friendly titles. He was created by the Empire. He had been genetically manipulated. Keeping his identity hidden from her, he let her call him Rhis Vanur. He had escaped from the Ycsko and needed to complete his mission. Soon the Sko would own Trilby's Conclave, and later the Empire, unless he succeeded. No one, not even Rhis, believed he could ever care for anyone. Emotions were a waste of time and dangerous! But Trilby slowly wiggled inside his defenses.  <br /> <br />The Sko had Trilby's ship on their Kill List though no one knew why. An old, high-ranking, ex-boyfriend was out to win Trilby back for his own treacherous reasons. Trilby's nav charts (over 30 years old) were suddenly valuable to some anonymous forces. Her old friends were disappearing, Sko related somehow. But her new friends from Razalka were dangerous.

Andrew Mayhem has had trouble finding a steady job. Let's face it, with Andrew's track record of killing people (in self defense, of course) getting hired is not easy. And anyone in close proximity to Andrew always ends up having his awful luck spill over onto him. But Andrew is really trying to be a responsible adult. He has two kids and a pregnant wife to consider. So no more accepting jobs in a bar from beautiful women offering him lots of money or jobs that pays big money for one night of work. Things are looking up for Andrew.  <br /> <br />His best friend, Roger Tanglen, seems to be having better luck too. Roger now has a gorgeous blond girlfriend named Samantha. Andrew cannot help but feel threatened by Samantha though. Andrew was in short supply of friends and he feared Samantha might take Roger away. So Helen, Andrew's wife, decides they all need take a vacation for a short while.  <br /> <br />Andrew rents a camper (pays extra for insurance too since he is now being responsible) and they all take off for Wreitzer Park. Someone suggests a short cut, but Andrew's luck has proven bad when it comes to short cuts. Therefore, Andrew refuses to stray from the map. So that is how they end up trapped in the woods by crazy people wanting to take them to a mad scientist's lab. Andrew's luck remains constant.  <br /> <br />***** I have often been quoted as saying that this author, Jeff Strand, is one sick puppy. Well, I now stand corrected. Jeff Strand is NOT one sick puppy. Jeff Strand is one totally insane, foaming at the mouth, rabid demon. And yes, you may quote me on that too. This is the third book featuring Andrew Mayhem and his rotten luck. If you do not like your horror involving children and innocents being killed and/or tortured, do NOT read this. If you like your horror to be at its worst, but with some laughter thrown in, then this is the book for you! There were parts that had me laughing aloud and there were parts where I wondered if I really wanted tocontinue reading. Sound like a book for you? Then snatch up this book as soon as you can.

It tells the story of an inquisitive little frog who lives near a castle moat. One day when his tiny black eyes were peeping above the water, he saw a very colorful royal gift box that sent his imagination soaring. He knew it definitely contained something special - but what could it be?<br />As children turn the pages of this vividly illustrated book, they begin a fantastic journey with the little frog as he searches for clues about the contents of the gift box. Their pilgrimage will take them high into a beanstalk where a caterpillar is happily munching along. There in that beanstalk they learn that the gift in the box can say, \\"Hello.\\" Later, on a sailboat with the wind billowing the sails, they learn that the gift in the box can be blown. As each new clue is discovered, they can ponder what the frog thinks the gift is by watching the many expressions on his scrunched up face. It can warm you. It can be planted. It can be thrown. What can this something special be? In the end, children will discover what the gift is, and they will come to realize that this magical gift is no good at all until you give it away.<br />***** The illustrations in this book are stunning and the attention to the smallest detail is remarkable - like the tiny black ant that is pushing a snowball and wearing a red scarf around his neck. The act of turning each page opens another part of the little frog's color filled world to delight children everywhere. Even the cover has immediate eye appeal. Green vines twist and twine themselves around the page to form each letter of the title, Something Special, and most children won't fail to notice the miniature snail and dragonfly who are also doing their part. When you couple that expressive script along with the little green frog's smiling face and curious eyes, what could be a more captivating and picturesque scene?<br />This is an enchanting book, and is highly recommendedfor bedtime reading. *****	2005-06-05

He wants her!  <br /> <br />***** The first book in this trilogy is \\"EndGame\\". The main characters for it return as secondary characters in this tale of intrigue. The last book will be released 9/05 and should be titled \\"Exposure\\". Each novel is a stand-alone story. Yet they all center on the elite team of Last Chance.  <br /> <br />I did not think that the author could possibly do better than \\"EndGame\\". Yet Dee Davis has surpassed all my expectations. No matter how much I needed to get things done around my home, I simply could not put this book down. Chores could wait. Dinner can be delivered. So make sure you will not be interrupted (A.K.A. take the phone off the hook) and get comfortable. Then let Dee Davis take you on one heck of a ride! *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-06-01

Two years ago Francesca DeAngelo Harris returned home with carry out food for her husband, Jake, to find him carrying out his luggage. Jake left Francie without a word of explanation, leaving her with a 1200 acre, hundred year old vineyard and their six-year-old son, Nicholas. Fortunately, her mother-in-law (Julianne) ran a catering business out of the home. With Julianne's help, Francie managed very nicely on her own...until now.  <br /> <br />Grape Growers Incorporated \\"GGI\\" is determined to mass-produce wine in the valley, putting all the small, independent vintners out of business. Mitchell Gillette is transferred from San Francisco to make it happen. His twin children, fifteen-year-olds Sarah and Drew, must move from the city to the valley with him. Mitch had divorced their mother long ago and the kids had lived with her. However, their mother died very recently. He does not really know his children and they are all up-tight. Sarah and Drew are handling all the sudden life changes differently. Sarah is trying her best to fit in and adapt. Drew is falling in with a bad crowd.  <br /> <br />Francesca comes home after a hard day of work to find her ex-husband, Jake, sitting at the table. Jake swears he is reformed and wants back into her life. That is a shock in itself. But shortly thereafter, Francie finds Mitch, the corporate enemy of the entire valley, at the table. Even worse, Julianne is falling in love with Mitch. Life is full of surprises.  <br /> <br />***** Many good novels have been written dealing with one rocky relationship and also involving major businesses. However, THIS book deals with twice as much. This story revolves around two main \\"romance\\" relationships, as well as, around the problems that single parents with rebellious teens must endure. Under it all is the community's winery troubles. It all sounds like a lot to cram into a single novel, however, the author has managed to pull it off. The story flows smoothly. You will never find yourselfconfused either. Author Jeanette Baker has created a marvelous and realistic modern day tale that readers will long remember! *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-06-01

Taxidermy collector and businessman Garth Carson has the most foul luck when it comes to buying and selling taxidermy. His girlfriend, Angie, is usually dragged into whatever mess Garth gets himself into.  <br /> <br />During a buying tour Garth purchases a white crow under a bell glass for Angie's birthday present. Even before he gets it out of the store and into his car someone is trying to take it from him. When Angie receives it, she instantly loves it. Yet within a VERY short time Angie and Garth are locked in the basement while two thugs steal the white crow.  <br /> <br />With Garth's talent for troubling trouble instead of allowing trouble to trouble him, he soon finds himself and Angie running for their lives from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife, a bunch of murderous pygmies, a funeral home director, various \\"carnies\\", special agents of all kinds, a crazed Penguin Boy, and (of course) Detective Walker who has wanted to arrest Garth for an extended amount of time now.  <br /> <br />***** I did not believe that author Brian Wiprud could possibly do any better than he did with his previous book \\"Pipsqueak\\". Thankfully, I have been proven wrong. This novel had me laughing so hard at times that I had to wipe my eyes in order to keep reading. I found myself actually putting several bookmarks in spots just so I could go back later and reread some funnier sections! Now THAT is talent, Readers. So sit back and enjoy the most wacky, humorous, yet serious mystery story of your life. *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-06-01

She did everything a nice Greek girl was supposed to do in order to please her family. But that all changed when Sofie caught her groom doing a lot more than kissing the maid of honor only moments before the wedding. Amazingly, her family and the priest tried to get her to go through with the wedding anyway. Well, Sofie began thinking for herself right then! She punched out the priest, chucked the engagement ring into the garbage disposal, quit her waitress job at the family's Greek restaurant, and became a junior detective for her uncle's detective agency.  <br /> <br />Being a P.I. is not glamourous as everyone believes. Sofie had gone to school with Pimply Pino. With Pino now a copy and her a P.I. things are even worse now than back in school. Being a P.I. also means that the family volunteers your services too, no matter how busy you are. So Sofie finds herself multitasking. Mrs. K, the nosy neighbor, insists Sofie locate her mongrel (a mean Jack Russell terrier named Muffy) that has disappeared. She must also prove to various people that another neighbor, Mr. Ivan Romanoff, has NOT been knocked off by one of his relatives. (Sof will not even attempt to make them believe he is not a real vampire.) At the same time she must pay her bills by doing what her client, Bud Suleski, hired her to do which is to prove that his wife is having an affair. And just WHY is the FBI hunting her? Sofie has to keep the FBI from finding her just so she can do her job. <br /> <br />Oh, and one last thing, the mystery man. Jake Porter will not say who he is or what he does. Background check says he does not exist. Yet he keeps popping up to help her. He is especially handy with tinkering under the hood of her Mustang. But she wishes he would tinker more with her.  <br /> <br />**** This story takes \\"Fiction\\" to a whole new level. More than one plot is continuously running. There are also a few sub-plots to keep the pace moving at a good clip. Romance is touched on, but no hot scenes, so either gender will enjoy the ride. Of course, everything closes neat and tidy. Yet Tori Carrington ends it in a way so that another \\"Sofie\\" book may come out in the future. I certainly hope there is another! Lots of action, comedy, and mystery rolled into one great tale. Recommended reading. ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-06-01

Kathleen \\"Katie\\" Chandler lives in a one bedroom apartment, with two roommates, in New York. Her awful boss goes from hot to cold in an instant and treats all her employees worse than any animal.  <br /> <br />Suddenly Katie begins getting job offers, via email, from MSI, Inc. It has the feel of a scam, but Katie is getting desperate to change jobs. So she goes to an interview. Turns out that MSI stands for Magic, Spells, & Illusions. It is a company that sells tricks of the trade to the magical beings in the community. Katie does not take much persuading. She has been seeing people with wings (whose feet do not touch the ground), a stone gargoyle that changes positions and buildings (and seemed to wink once), and many other odd things. Katie has always assumed no one else seemed to notice because they were used to it and she had just not been living in NY long enough.  <br /> <br />Katie takes the job and begins working in the department of Verification. Katie's ordinariness is rare. Few people, such as herself, lack even a drop of magic. Magic will not work on Katie. Therefore, she can easily spot a fake spell, see hidden clauses in contracts, detect any magically disguised intruders, and more.  <br /> <br />The company needs \\"immunes\\" like Katie very badly. An ex-employee is threatening to sell black magic on the streets. If the magic community begins using dark spells, it will harm more than just the magical people in the world. Katie and her new bosses must save the world as we know it.  <br /> <br />***** This is a stand alone novel, but I sure hope it becomes the first of a series. Katie's love life is not mentioned in my synopsis because she has her sights on more than one potential guy. I am told that this is Shanna Swendson's debut novel. I would never have known by reading it. The writing is superb and the story is seamless! Fans of Charlaine Harris's \\"Southern Vampire\\" series will especially enjoy this new author!

She is a \\"by-the-book\\" kind of woman. However, she also knows that some things cannot be explained, such as the existence of Ryder Latimer. Ryder is the man she loves. He is also a vampire. They have already lived through one tough adventure. (Last book \\"Darkness Calls\\" ISBN 0373273533) Ryder is still too weak to be out in the sun as yet. Weak or not, danger is near.  <br /> <br />Dr. Melissa Danvers has taken on the role of caretaker for Ryder Latimer, as her relatives had before her. Until her parents died last year, she had no idea that Ryder was vampire. She only knew that Ryder had always been there for her and her family. He was, and is, like a godfather to her. Melissa is still catching up on the journals her relatives had written. Problem is that someone has recently slipped into her office at the hospital and stolen one of the journals her father had written. As a precaution, Melissa must ask for help from Sebastian Reyes.  <br /> <br />Sebastian is Diana's brother. He gets enough money by being a security consultant for businesses that he does not have to work outside the home. He also makes computer games as another source of income. He and Melissa had one night together (last book). Sebastian is sure that it was merely for comfort, at least on Melissa's side. Thinking she could not be interested in him, he has kept his distance. So when she shows up at his door for help, he is thrown for a loop. Can he possibly scan all the journals and encrypt the files and the database for her without becoming too involved with her? <br /> <br />In the darkness, someone watches Melissa. The stolen journal does not tell enough. Soon other steps will have to be taken. More people will have to be silenced. Melissa will help or die.  <br /> <br />***** This is an ongoing series by Silhouette's Intimate Moments books. The first book, \\"Darkness Calls\\", had fans begging for more. Silhouette heard the cries for more and responded by making it a series. This novel is the second in the new vampire series by author Caridad Pineiro. (The third book is due for release in October 2005. Of course, the date of release may change.)  <br /> <br />This time readers get to see a bit deeper into the personalities of each character. The relationship between Diana and Ryder as secondary in this one. The author focuses much more on the relationship between Melissa and Sebastian. There are some pretty steamy love scenes between the new couple, but more time is given to the suspenseful plot of murder and dark researches. Caridad Pineiro is an author to keep your eyes on. This series has the potential to only get better and better! *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-06-01

But Tony is about to face even more changes within himself. Talents that only a rare few shifters are gifted with are beginning to emerge from within Tony as well, and he does NOT like them! <br />Something is kidnapping the female shapeshifters. This is not something that would normally affect humans, but the most recently kidnapped shifter is the girlfriend of a human named Carmine Leone. Carmine is the Mafia don and Tony's former boss. Unless Tony, Sue, and an elite group of shifters can locate the kidnapped shifters quickly and destroy an unknown menace, Carmine is prepared to wage an all out war. Even though the shapeshifters would win a war against the Mafia, doing so would expose their culture to the humans. <br />**** An exciting sequel to \\"Hunter's Moon\\" but it does start up too slowly.

Prince Alexei Pruzinsky of Avalonia is arrogance personified, dangerously charming, and a master at the art of seduction. He meets a mysterious young woman at a masked ball and spends one night in bed with her. His heart is touched in ways he has never felt before. They both know that marriage is impossible due to their stations, however, Alexei is upset that she refuses to take off her mask or tell him her name.  <br /> <br />Miss Pamela Effington fled London six years ago rather than face scandal, thanks to George Fenton, son of Viscount Penwick, bragging to his buddies. She lives and travels with Aunt Millicent, who uses her widowhood and vast wealth to live as she pleases. It seems that Aunt Millicent is known world wide by all who matter. Pamela knows it is not safe to succumb to Alexei, yet she now has takes with her a glorious memory to cherish forever. Imagine Pamela's surprise when she finds Alexei and his staff occupying the London townhouse that she has recently inherited.  <br /> <br />Aunt Millicent suggests that Pamela and Alexei pretend to be engaged. This would help ease Pamela back into Society's good graces. After all, no one could think badly of her if a PRINCE wishes to wed her. When she breaks the engagement later, every eligible man will beg for her hand in marriage. However, Alexei finds himself drawn to Pamela without knowing why and Pamela is desperately keeping her secrets.  <br /> <br />***** The author includes a character named Valentina. She is Alexei's traitorous cousin. She has spent her life trying to kill Alexei, for Avalonia's own good of course. Valentina resides in the townhouse as well, claiming to have changed. As much as I really wanted to hate Valentina, I simply could not! The author did such a fantastic job on this character that she actually steals the show often. I dearly hope that Valentina gets her own story. The very idea is tantalizing!  <br /> <br />Author Victoria Alexander has done an outstanding job in this tale.The heroine is someone that today's ladies can easily look up to.

(Think Merlin the Magician with pointed elf ears.) He is an Adept at Magick. Arion learns that one of Orfo's followers, Lord Vraasz, has found the Tri-Lith of the Yorben. With it, Vraasz can free Orfo. The Tri-Lith combines the three Parton powers (Magick, Psi, and Pneuma) into the all-powerful Bahratic Power. (Okay Readers, this is as simple as I could explain it.

All poor Scott has been told is that he has a Pneuma Power, even though he is unaware of it. He must learn to control it and use it to save the day. Problem is that no one will tell him just HOW he is supposed to do it.  <br /> <br />***** This novel is hard to write an enlightening synopsis for. In fact, my explanation of the story only touches the main plot. There are quite a few characters, each with interesting attitudes and abilities. There are just as many problems and obstacles too. Just when I thought I understood it all, the \\"malapert\\" author throws in twists. Not just one twist. Nooooo. All-in-all, you will find yourself royally entertained, never bored, and begging for more. *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-05-10

Lillian Cleary is an attorney for a prestigious law firm in Sarasota. No matter how over worked she is, Lilly gives each case her all. She wins MUCH more often than she loses. She is well known for her in-depth investigations of each case and her killer cross-examination technique in the courtroom.  <br /> <br />The senior partners are notorious for dropping ridiculous cases on her desk, as well as, for giving her cases that THEY cannot win. One of these cases is a malpractice lawsuit. Lilly soon finds herself with a bulls eye on her back and a suspiciously deceased doctor client. Finding an expert witness is no easy task either apparently.  <br /> <br />*** A good legal mystery, but at times the humor falls flat. I found Lilly Cleary to be a fast thinking, very intelligent lady that often gets through problems by sheer luck or good timing. She is definitely a character that I would like to read more about in the future! ***  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-05-06

She had two bullets in her back and had spent hours in the ocean during one of the worst storms of the year. A local found her in the early dawn and nursed her unexpected guest back to life. Angel could not remember what had happened to her. She could not even recall her own name. However, she discovered that she had a familiarity with weapons, Dim-Mak combat and assassination techniques, and was fluent in at least six languages. Whoever had tried to kill her came back to finish the job. When he failed, another came. The assassins had one thing in common. Each had a small tattoo, an intricately detailed image of Pegasus - just like the one on her ankle. Angel made herself disappear. Six years pass.  <br /> <br />She is now Sheriff Rianna \\"Ria\\" Kingsley of Tripolo, Alabama, newly appointed. Ria keeps people at a distance. She has no real friends. The only person in the world who knows that she is not what she seems to be is Benny, and they have never met face-to-face. Benny has never asked questions. For that, Ria has made his bank account grow. It was Benny that made her new identity. He is a computer genius. The best \\"cracker\\" she has ever found. Only six weeks into her new career and the local county commissioner is patting his own back for hiring Ria. The new sheriff has busted more drug rings and dealers than any before her.  <br /> <br />Jake Tarrance owns a restaurant in a nearby county. It is one of the few legal businesses he has. Most of his income is obtained outside the law, but there is never any proof. Jake has eyes and ears everywhere, including within the nearby prison walls. Ria dines there one night because it is outside her jurisdiction and no one knows who she is. She can be alone. Of course, Ria and Jake are instantly attracted and neither knows the occupation of the other. They find out too late. Their relationship might have ended there, except Ria finds another lead on the tattoo. A lead that might finally tell her who she was over six years ago and what happened that stormy night long ago. Yet by following the tattoo lead, Ria would lead the group of assassins right to her door.  <br /> <br />***** Once you begin reading this book, you will not be able to pull yourself away. The suspense begins on page one and continues until the last page has been turned. The best thing you can do is to order out for pizza and tell your family not to bother you unless the house is burning down. Only then should you get comfortable and open to page one. Otherwise you will snappish every time something interrupts your reading, your mind on nothing but getting back to the book. Yes, Readers, this story is THAT good! Highly recommended reading! *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-05-06

Her sister, Joan, specializes in coffee table books. Last heard, Joan was in the English Cotswolds, a quiet Marleton village. Joan's current project is a book on religious art, commissioned by the Cotswolds Diocese of the Church of England. All was fine until Joan's emails became strange and then ceased all together. Rose travels to England, worried about her sister, but Joan has disappeared. Knowing that Joan met with the famous horror writer, V.F. \\"Vic\\" Drummond, Rose begins her search with him.<br /><br />Vic and Rose become a couple, but he is lying (by omission) when it came to what Joan was doing whenever he met with her. But the truth will come out, sooner than expected. The local residents protect their own and keep Rose at bay until Vic shows everyone how much he has come to care for Rose. Then they embrace Rose into their shops, pubs, and town. However, the church is a different story.<br /><br />Rose and Vic soon discover that Joan had been fascinated by All Saints Church, which dominates the village, and the famous tapestry that resides within it. But something totally evil also dwells in All Saints Church. Something that has slowly seeped into every stone and crevice over the last thirty years. It affects everyone that enters its doors ... and it is now spreading outside the church, even into London! Rose and Vic cannot dismiss all the eerie things that are happening, no matter how much they wish they could. Dark dreams leave scratch marks upon them that never seem to heal. (Something right out of an \\"Elms Street\\" movie.) Vic's deceased aunt keeps typing messages in his current book's file. No matter how many times Vic deletes the texts, they keep coming back. But the worst things are the demons with the red, glowing eyes!<br /><br />**** This combines many genres. I noticed Super Natural Romance, Thriller, and Horror mostly. About half way in, the love scenes begin and they are H-O-T, very explicit! Consider yourself warned. Quite a bit of English slang is used. Most of it is used in such a way that readers who do not live in England will still easily understand what is being said. For example, the slang \\"not on\\" means \\"wrong\\". However, once or twice I found myself unsure. Do I recommend this novel? Oh yes! To fans of many genres, especially Dark Romance. This work of art may keep you awake at night. ****<br /><br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-05-06

Lord Nicholas Huntington returns home wounded from the war in hopes of seeing his father who is near death. His father continues to live thanks to Dr. Kittridge, the most talented physician in all of Europe. As the good doctor cares for his father, the doctor's daughter takes care of Lord Nick. All Lord Nick wishes to do is return to the war and leave everything else to his half brother, Lord Edwin. Dealing with his stepmother and Edwin is just more than Nick can seem to stomach.  <br /> <br />Miss Charlotte Kittridge is proud to be her father's nurse. She knows she is not pretty and accepts that she is long past her prime. She wants only to learn from her father and help care for his patients. When Lord Nicholas arrives unconscious and then slightly delirious, she jumps into her nurse role, even against her patient's wishes. Charlotte is attracted to the man, but keeps her distance and treats him like any other patient. She and her father are kept busy tending the two lords. Yet Fate gives them an added burden anyway. Charlotte's cousin, \\"Alexandre\\" Lord Gaston, arrives in all his flirting glory.  <br /> <br />Lord Nicholas finds his eyes searching out Miss Charlotte far too often. Her delicate touch and intelligent mind keeps him fascinated. Even though he is drawn to the lady, he must keep his distance. He promised his father that he would never marry. Yet seeing Alexandre vie for Charlotte's passion is just too much for him to handle.  <br /> <br />***** Once again author Sophia Nash entices readers to lose themselves within her latest regency novel. And once again I find myself extremely glad that I did. There is much more going on than I am able to reveal without spoilers and quite a few more characters, each with their own unique personality. The people are so believable that I feel as though I actually know them. Sophia Nash breathes life into her characters in a way so few authors can.

She is searching for something or someone, yet has no idea who or what. She takes a job as caretaker for Paradine Park. It is to be turned into a spa resort soon by the new American owners. For nine years the huge estate remained empty. The Buchanan family resided there, but it all ended in tragedy. The locals still talk of what happened so long ago. The oldest brother, Adam, had always been at odds with his younger brother, Robert. Their mother preferred Robert and did not seem to care who knew. Robert could do not wrong. It is said that Adam murdered Robert one night, outside, while the house slept. Adam then disappeared. It is said no one witnessed it, but everyone knew Adam was the killer. The mother killed herself shortly afterward. <br />The estate fascinated Justine. She begins taking photos of the house and grounds. But when she develops the film in the dark room, ghost images of a wolf keep appearing. The wolf is not on the negatives though. Even stranger, when she develops the same negatives again, the wolf is still there, but has moved! She also finds herself drawn to Adam, though she has never met him. She has only seen his picture. Justine begins to wonder about her sanity. Yet she is determined to find him.<br />Adam Buchanan now goes by the name Adam Williams. For the past nine years he has lived in Southeast Africa. He lives in a ghost town, like a hermit, with very few friends. He spends most of his time scuba diving or observing a family of strandwolves (brown hyenas). He and his close friend, Mark, are having trouble with a cruel man named Grachikov. Grachikov is cares nothing for wildlife and slaughters animals for profits, whether it is legal or not. When Adam sees a picture of Justine in a magazine, he believes he has met his soul mate. They have the same two tattoos. He is determined to find her. <br />Unknown to either Justine or Adam, there is a Watcher. The Watcher saw what really happened that dark night nine years ago. He knows what really happened to the family afterward too. And now, he is watching Justine. <br />** Be warned that there is severe animal cruelty in this book! Animals are slaughtered, in cold blood, for no real reason at all. Many readers avoid books at all cost with things such as this in them. So consider yourself warned. In my opinion, there is no real suspense in this story. Readers learn, almost from the beginning, exactly who the Watcher is. The two main characters, Justine and Adam, do not even meet until long past the half way point of the story. The author gives wonderful details of the Buchanan estate, of the African continent, and of photography images. I found them very interesting. It is obvious she did extensive research. This is an author that I will be keeping an eye on in the future. Lots of talent and potential. ** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-04-26

Since Faith is a caterer, she happily steps in as the resort's chef until a replacement can be found. Things get worse as the week goes on.

Faith is amazed at the things she is learning about her family members. Things she really did NOT want to know.  <br />  <br />** This novel is not nearly as good as all the previous books in this mystery series. I found this case very easy to solve. The first half of the novel is extremely slow. The only good parts during the first half is the recipes that the author goes into details on how to make. Of course for those who are interested, the recipes can be found either in the back of this novel or in the back of previous novels. There are too many flash backs as well. Often as I read, Faith would find something or have something happen in the first paragraph of a new chapter and then flashes back to the day before. I must read almost the entire chapter before even knowing what is going on. I felt as if I was left suspended somewhere. In my opinion, the story would have been much better had it just been written in the order things happened. As a fan, I can only hope the next mystery in this series is better. **  <br />  <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews. <br />	2005-04-26

Amishwoman Sara Lapp, has all but been shunned for studying with \\"the English\\" local doctor, Dr. Jordan Marks, to become a midwife. After months of waiting, she is called to tend the birth of her best friend, Abby. However, upon arriving, Sara finds Abby has already died in childbirth. Abby's husband, \\"Mad\\" Adam Zuckerman, did not want Sara to help Abby deliver the baby. He wants Sara to take his four daughters, including the new born, home with her to raise.  <br /> <br />Adam is a self-appointed outcast. He keeps everyone at a distance. He dares not love anyone, including Abby and his children. Adam's childhood had been far from happy. In fact, Adam never recalls smiling even once in his entire life. Adam fears that he has too much of his father in him and he cannot have his children around him without Abby to protect them should his father's blood prove true. It is best for him, and his children, that they be raised with someone who could give them the love they so desperately need. Someone like Sara.  <br /> <br />When a drunken Adam falls from a barn loft Sara moves in to tend him, and she brings his girls. Then the Bishop and the Elders take a stand. They must marry or they, and the children, would be shunned. Sara knows there is something good in Adam. There has to be or Abby would never have fallen in love with him and married him. Sara has hope of drawing it out of him. She hopes to heal him. If not, she will love and raise the children as her own.  <br /> <br />Unexepected help, and trouble, arrives when Lena (Adam's mother) and Emma (Adam's quiet sister) knock on the door. Adam has believes them to have died long ago, another lie from his father. Now Sara has help with the children and can do her midwife duties without worrying about the children. However, Adam, Lena, and Emma have much to resolve. Sara must teach everyone in her new home that there is a time for everything under God's heaven. Now is the timefor healing. Yet as Sara teaches those she loves to bloom, they teach her much more in return.  <br /> <br />***** Fans of the TV show \\"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\\" will adore this novel! Sara came across to me as almost a mirror image of Dr. Quinn. She is strong when need be (stubborn), stands up for those in need (sharp tongued), and has so much love to give everyone. She also must deal with the Amish ordnung (rules) which makes everything near impossible. I found myself cheering her on to victory.  <br /> <br />The author, Annette Blair, has a real writing talent. She inserts tiny things that the reader does not immediately notice, but makes the reader come to care for the characters as if they were kin. You may need tissues nearby at some points of the story. Another award winner that I cannot recommend highly enough. *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-04-25

His fortress was destroyed and sealed. Problem is that no one knew Hydrais had already hidden a scroll in the bowels of his underground domain called Trnith. He had also forged a special mirror. Its sole purpose was to summon him back into this world if his body was ever diminished.  <br /> <br />Wrantha is the \\"Keeper of the Nether\\" and one of the gods that balance all the planes that form the fabric of time. He wrote the Black Book of Wrantha in which he posted powerful secrets. It is balanced by the Book of Light, guarded by the goddess Sheevos. Her spirit is currently residing in a magic Elfstone, named after her. Long has the Sheevos Elfstone resided in the Temple of Arnir. Recently, though, the Sheevos has been stolen. No one seems to know who took it or where it may now be. As for the Black Book of Wrantha, it is in the hands of Haarath, a dark magician.  <br /> <br />Hydrais' mirror has now been found and used to locate the hidden city of Trnith, where the scroll is kept. Dark forces are gathering to shred the balance so that chaos and destruction may reign.  <br /> <br />All hope of defeating the coming foes rests upon a small group of beings. Farrin is the greatest of all giants. King Hrathis is the greatest king of men. Aeligon the Healer is a powerful wizard with his apprentice's soul trapped within his staff. Ithyllna is an elf maiden with an acrobatic flair and a deadly member of the Vrnyn Guards. Foran is the best elf archer. And most importantly, Aerinas, who is the elfin heir to the House of Lythardia and gifted with magic that he has yet to master.  <br /> <br />**** I wondered why the author called this \\"Part Zero\\". Now I understand. Within this novel the battle lines are drawn and the readers learn about the wondrous characters. An interesting mix it is too! There are insect-like monsters called Cray, Orcs, Goblins, Trolls, Elfs, Giants, Wizards, and (my favorite of legendary creatures) a Roc!I sometimes got my characters confused, so you may have a bit of trouble with that. Many characters begin with the letter H and two of the major characters, Aeligon and Aerinas, can easily be read wrong. Otherwise, this is an excellent beginning to a terrific set of novels.

Twenty-six-year-old Chyna Marsh is a well known author of dark romances. Feeling the need to escape the big city, Chyna moves to Mystic Islands, New Jersey. The local residents quickly begin filling her head with tales of Old Rocky Road which is said to be haunted, a witch that lives in the lighthouse, and of the graveyard covered in the bones of the witch's victims. Chyna decides to go exploring and meets Elaine Grayson. Elaine's last name startles Chyna, because Chyna's dreams have been filled lately with the dark image of a handsome man named Quinn Grayson. Finding out that Quinn is real and Elaine's brother is shocking, but Chyna finds her herself attracted to his brother, Kirk.  <br /> <br />Quinn Grayson is obsessed with Chyna. He pays the old witch well for potions and spells to destroy her home and lure her into his. He never imagines that she would look beyond his handsome face and spy the evil beast within. Nor does it cross his mind that she may see beyond his brother's grotesque face to the kind man beneath.  <br /> <br />Kirk Grayson's face is twisted with deep scars due to a car wreck ten years before. The wreck killed his parents. Kirk's guilt refuses to let him seek help with cosmetic surgery. He prefers to dwell in the shadows and live in the basement of the family's mansion, where he thinks a monster, such as himself, should reside. When beautiful Chyna makes advances toward him, Kirk believes her to be toying with him. For how could such a lovely lady stand to look upon the face of a monster?  <br /> <br />*** This dark romance came across to me as the fond, old gothics used to. Within these pages I found magic, witches with spells, obsession, betrayal, and love ever-lasting. However, be warned that there is one violent and graphic scene where the heroine is taken against her will. Some readers avoid books with any scenes such as this one. There are also times that I found myself wanting to kick Kirk in the shin for his gullible tendencies. He came across as immature a few times. If you love the tale of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", then you will enjoy this dark dream come true. Well done. ***  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-04-12

If you decide to read anyway, do not bother complaining to the author or this reviewer. You were warned.  <br /> <br />As the two main characters investigate and learn about the poison, the reader is shown the horrible potential of biochemical weapons. The author, Mike Brogan, shows what COULD someday happen with this devastating work of fiction. As the reader, I had to keep reminding myself that this was fiction. The author made it all so realistic that my mind refused to look at some of what was happening in the story. It kept shying away. I had to force myself to return and reread pages.

He becomes totally obsessed with making certain the vision does NOT come to pass. Anakin's worry for Padm's life is not the only tension he has. Palpatine wants Anakin to virtually spy for him on the Jedi Council and the Council flat out orders him, but \\"off the record\\", to spy on the Chancellor for them!  <br /> <br />Of course, Readers already know that Palpatine planned many, many years ago, for all this to happen. Palpatine also knows that the Jedi Council is hot on the trail of locating the identity of the hidden Sith Lord. Before they learn that the Sith Lord is Palpatine, he must convince Anakin to betray the Jedi Order and become his dark apprentice. To do so, Palpatine will offer Anakin his heart's desire; immortality and the dark power to keep hiswife from dying during child birth. Anakin will face his hardest choice ever. Will he save Padm? Or betray and destroy the entire Jedi Order?  <br /> <br />***** It will be difficult to place this novel on the big screen. The beginning will be full of breathtaking special effects. The middle will be filled with political strife and Anakin's temper tantrums. (I apologize, but there is absolutely no other way to put Anakin's emotions.) The climatic ending, however, will have a huge impact on the Reader and promises to be the most memorable scene EVER for Star Wars fans. I highly recommend reading this book BEFORE going to see the movie at the end of May 2005. If the book of Episode III is anything like Episode II, then the people that reads this novel before seeing it all unfold on the big screen will understand a whole lot more of what is going on and why things are happening a certain way. By reading first, you understand why Anakin chooses what he does at the end. Whether you agree with his reasoning or not, you will understand. Also, there will be scenes omitted from the movie version, just as some humorous parts and what could have been awesome special effects were deleted from the second episode.  <br /> <br />Whether you read this novel or not, buy it. You can bet money that this novel will become and remain part of the most unique and original sci-fi saga ever created! This novel is not to be missed! *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-04-08

He had one hundred and ninety Marines, Bravo Company, of the Empress' Own. It took three previous novels for them to get off Marduk. Along the way, Roger discovered that he was the heir of Miranda MacClintock, the first Empress of Man, and one paranoid and devious woman. The \\"Playboy Prince\\" no longer worried only about his fashionable clothing. Roger grew up fast, the hard way. During the eight months on Marduk, Roger became a leader that Bravo Company could look up to. A vital member of their group, as well as, to the Empire. Now there are twelve survivors of Bravo Company. Some Mardukans have been recruited into Roger's service as The Basik's Own. That title is an inside joke. You will have to read the series to understand.  <br /> <br />The Basik's Own now has a challenge before them that may put all their previous perils to shame. The coup launched by Jackson Adoula, Prince of Kellerman, has obviously succeeded. Roger's mother, Empress Alexandra, is being controlled by the same people who had murdered her children and her grandchildren. Yet no one seems to realize it. Either that, or there is nothing they can do about it. To make matters worse, the coup and murders are all blamed on Roger.  <br /> <br />The Basik's Own must gamin some dangerous allies, slip into the Empire, locate and meet with crucial military leaders, convince them of Roger's innocence and to help, find weapons, form a plan, retake the palace, save the Empress, capture Adoula and the Earl of New Madrid (Roger's biological father), and save the Empire.  <br /> <br />Prince Roger of House MacClintock will prove, once and for all, that he is nothing like his despised father. Prince Roger is totally Empress Alexandra's son! And Hades is about to get a lot of new customers!  <br /> <br />**** An excellent continuation to the series by twoauthors who have proven themselves to be a formidable team. The first three novels had more battles and readers got to watch Roger morph into a true ruler. In book four, readers learn just how devious Miranda MacClintock was (and in some ways, still is). There are more strategies and a little more romance in this one also. Sergeant Nimashet Despreaux returns to help balance Roger and takes on a larger role in the books' plots.  <br /> <br />All-in-all, David Weber and John Ringo have another winner with this novel. Fans will NOT be disappointed. But if you have not read the first three in this series, purchase them quickly and read them in order. Otherwise, you will find yourself lost at times during this tale. Personally, I cannot recommend this series highly enough. ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews. <br />	2005-04-07

Robert and Lily Brewster are siblings trying to make it through the Depression. They live in their great-uncle's \\"Grace and Favor\\" mansion, penniless but doing well. Franklin Roosevelt's inauguration is under way. Robert even makes a very uncomfortable trip to Washington to witness the historic even.  <br /> <br />The day after Robert returns home (he needed a day to recover), he goes with Lily to their new temporary job. Miss Twibell has turned her huge house into a nursing home and one of her employees is out sick for awhile.  <br /> <br />Trouble follows the Brewsters, as it normally does, One of the elderly residents, Mr. Sean Connor, is murdered in his bed. The bizarre thing is that everyone knew Mr. Connor only had a few more hours to live anyway. Why would someone bother to kill him? Since he was such an ill tempered man, he had no close friends. No one seems to have liked the man; not even his wife or kids. His children has had no contact with Mr. or Mrs. Connor in years.  <br /> <br />Chief of Police Howard Walker is on the case, but he cannot seem to make much head way. Not for lack of trying though. Howard is an excellent cop. The Connor case is not the only one on Howard's mind. Spring thaw has turned up another body that had spent the cold months under an iced over pond.  <br /> <br />***** Be warned that this is a reprint! Now that you know, let me inform you about his good mystery. The author did an outstanding job with this tale. The characters are all believable and the era description is true to form.

In April of 1912, Marjorie MacTavish was one of the few survivors when the mighty \\"Titanic\\" went down. Leonard, her fiance, went down with it. Marjorie believed her heart died with Leonard that tragic night. The only good thing about that cruise was that she met Loretta.  <br /> <br />It is now September, 1915. Marjorie may have been born in Glasgow and had poverty-stricken beginnings, but now she lives in San Francisco. Marjorie is the companion and secretary of Loretta Quarles. (A nine month, pregnant with twins, very outspoken, and wonderful friend.) The only draw back is that Loretta has a childhood chum named Jason. Though Loretta calls him \\"my friend\\", Marjorie calls him \\"the bane of my existence\\". But that is about to change.  <br /> <br />Though he has teased her for three years, Dr. Jason Abernathy is charmed by Marjorie and her soft brogue. When he learns she is in the cast of a local church's opera, he immediately joins as well. And when Lo Sing, his nursing assistant, needs the doctor to help the wounded in Chinatown after a tong war, Marjorie offers her pair of hands as well. Marjorie could not possibly know that she was about to enter the mess surrounding the Chinese Exclusion Act, a tong war, or a certain doctor's heart.  <br /> <br />**** Author Anne Robins (A.K.A. Alice Duncan) has another winner in this interesting tale set within San Francisco and its famous Chinatown. There is plenty of romance and suspense to keep you reading until the very end. As you read you will find out much about women's suffrage and the Chinese Exclusion Act. However, Anne Robins has blended it well into the story and you probably will not even realize you are learning something! Smoothly done indeed. ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-03-31

She hopes it is for NASA to give her a position on the moon base program as an impact specialist. Instead, the choice position is given to her nemesis, David Marsh. By stealing Erica's thesis, he had guaranteed himself of the position that Erica had long coveted.  <br /> <br />NASA sends Erica to Antarctica, where a hotspot has been found under the ice. They informed her of the thermal signature, but did not see fit to notify her that she is not part of the first group of scientists to investigate. Erica meets the famous archeologist, Allan Rocheford, en route. He is out to prove the Atlantis myth to be true and that the hot anomaly is part of the fabled city (that he believes to be located under the ice.)  <br /> <br />Once in Antarctica Erica meets their guide, Cathy Jones. Her boyfriend, Jimmy, had been part of the previous team that disappeared while investigating the hotspot. The last thing Cathy had heard from Jimmy and his team had been over the COMM. The team mentioned finding dead bodies and then a lot of screaming had been heard before static took over. Erica must find out what happened to her fellow scientists and just what is going on beneath the ice. The survival of the human race could depend on it. But to do so, Erica will have to join forces with the man she hates. She must work with David, who is on the moon and witnessing some incredible things as well.  <br /> <br />**** As I began reading this novel I had flashbacks to the beginning of the movie \\"Alien VS Predator\\". Same hotspot far under the ice in Antarctica with a possible pyramid. However, that is the ONLY thing this novel has in common with that movie. The story mainly follows Erica and the reader sees everything happen from her point of view. However, it switches to David on the moon a few times and the reader follows him. He makes some startling discoveries as well.  <br /> <br />It is obvious that the author did some serious research on a variety of topics in order to complete this story. The result is a wonderful piece of sci-fi that will stretch your imagination beyond its limits. Here is an author to keep your eye on! ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-03-28

But one car wreck threatens to take it all away from her. Monday wakes up as she is rushed into Central Hospital. She is so badly damaged that no one even recognizes her.  <br /> <br />The head plastic surgeon, Dr. Stephen White, has no idea that his near dead patient is a big celebrity. It would probably not phase him if he did. Dr. White is the best in his field. Many celebrities have willingly gone under his knife. Yet even believing that his patient is a normal, everyday person does not keep him from doing his very best by her ... even when she calls him a \\"Shmoo\\".  <br /> <br />Fate has brought together a crazy laughing female temptress and a doctor with a big ego and a lousy bedside manner.

In Bedfordshire, England, 1785, a dying gypsy woman gave birth to Lord Alex' illegitimate son and named him Dante. Alex never knew about Dante, because his own father (the Marquis of Alston a.k.a. Lord Alston) kept the information from him. Lord Alston had Dante's Romany grandparents, Sandor and Carlotta, raise the child. Lord Alston gave them gold to help care for Dante and insisted that Dante be sent to Cambridge at age sixteen. <br />Now, in 1813, Lord Alston wishes he had spent more time with his grandson, no matter Dante's heritage. Lord Alex had died ten years before with no children. Thus Lord Alston's nephew, Calvin, is next in line for the title. But Lord Alston did not trust Lord Calvin with the family fortune. Calvin gambled too often and spent money he did not have. Therefore, Lord Alston changes his will and makes Dante his heir. In a codicil of the will, Lord Alston demands that Dante wed Lady Esme Harcourt within six months of becoming the new Marquis of Alston. <br />As Dante steals a kiss from the beautiful lady at a country fair, he has no idea that her name is Lady Esme or that he is to meet her again in the near future. Dante intended to deny the title, wealth, and estate that his English grandfather is pushing on him. However, when Lord Alston is murdered and set up to look like suicide, Dante cannot let the murder of his kin go unpunished. He will accept the title and use everything in his power to locate the killer. As for Lady Esme, no matter how prejudiced she may be toward gypsies, she WILL become his wife. After all, she has already proven that she is not immune to his charms. <br />**** This story is filled with obstacles for the main characters to overcome, as well as danger, suspense, mystery, and romance.

The Three Mrs. Parkers follows the lives of three women as they come together to live with each other in the foothills of the mountains near the border of North Carolina and South Carolina. There are many controlling factors that bring each of them to this joining of their lives, and this is a place and circumstance that neither of them would have thought possible.<br />Winifred, at age 75, is the oldest of the Parker women and she has traveled the longest distance to reach what she hopes will be a refuge for her in Salem, South Carolina. There she plans to live out her days with her widowed daughter-in-law, fifty-two-year-old Zoe Parker, at Zoes invitation. However, what Zoe doesnt realize is that Winifreds health is rapidly declining.<br />Zoes telephone call asking Winifred to come was quite an unexpected opportunity for Winifred. Unexpected because she and Zoe had never liked each other and hadnt been in contact for years. Winifred had never accepted Zoe as her sons wife and had cut all ties with both of them shortly after the wedding. However, just as Winifred has an agenda so does Zoe. Zoe badly needs money to keep her from losing the beautiful mountain home that was left to her by her own parents; Winifred could provide the needed finances for that.<br />The third Parker woman is Katie, Zoes daughter. Winifred, by her own choice, has never met Katie, although she is her only grandchild. Katie is a young divorcée and has come to Salem following the death of her 9-year-old brain damaged daughter, Laurie Ann. She needs her mothers help to heal and a quiet place to grieve.<br />***** Joan Medlicott has a knack for getting inside the feelings and dreams of her characters in a way that allows the reader to completely understand and empathize with each of them, and I especially liked the paring of these three remarkable women. As they learn to live together and help each other, these three women redefine the meaning of struggle, compromise, forgiveness, and love.<br />This story is not another gentle read, as some like to say. It is HIGH DRAMA as it tells the stories of these womens lives. I have to confess that I was not prepared for the obstacles these women had to overcome, and I certainly didnt expect to be sitting on the edge of my seat wishing I could bite my nails  but I was! Bring it on, Joan! *****	2005-03-22

Angelica teaches Cicely history and literature so she can speak with her \\"protector\\", Lord Geoffrey, about his interests of Greek mythology.  <br /> <br />Angelica accepts Cicely's offer to a party in Vauxhall's pleasure garden for the sole reason of a meal. It is at this party that Angel meets Jason Kitterage. The attraction between them is mutual. Refusing to lower her standards though, she quits the party early. While doing so, Jason is hurt and has no choice but to care for him for a few days.  <br /> <br />Jason is an antiquities collector and seller. He is offering an ancient treasure, called the Mask of Aphrodite, up for bid to others that had attended the previous party. Once well enough, he convinces Angel to stay with him and his father. He vows not to press his attentions on her. She sets the pace.  <br /> <br />The Mask of Aphrodite is surrounded by legends. It is said that any woman who wears the mask becomes irresistible to all men and can enslave them to do her bidding. Problem is that the legends are true. Angel and Jason must keep the mask out of the wrong hands.  <br /> <br />***** No hot love scenes here. This is a clean and sweet regency romance. However, there is danger and magic throughout the tale. This book proves that you do not need hot bedroom scenes in order to have a marvelous story. Jason's father and brother are secondary characters in this book and their personalities light up the pages just as brightly as the main characters' do. In fact, I have high hopes that the brother will get his own magical story soon! Author Regan Allen proves herself to be an enchantress in this gem.

Cecil makes new friends and slips into the local town life almost seamlessly. She also becomes friends with three very different men.  <br /> <br />Richard is the editor of the local paper. He is patient, steady, and dependable. Tom is a lobsterman with the sea in his blood and has a mysterious part time job that pays the bills. His pragmatic look at life keeps Cecil guessing as to just what will happen next. Then there is Ronan who is shy about approaching Cecil as friends, and later as more, but with a spontaneous approach at life that attracts her.  <br /> <br />During her summer afternoons Cecil spends time on the shore line where she makes friends with a special seal named Ragnarok. Between Cecil's new friends, her business, and Ragnarok, her days are carefree and filled with warmth. But when night falls, Cecil is torn between the men.  <br /> <br />**** This is the debut novel of author Kate Brallier, and what an excellent one it is! It is larger than most books now-a-days, but only because the author inserts descriptive backgrounds of the characters and the town so that readers find themselves submerged into the life on Seal Island.

Sister Impervia takes her vows seriously but loves a good fight, so she knows much of the martial arts. Pelinor loves swords and blades so he constantly acts like a knight.

The boyfriend, Sebastian, has disappeared. He supposedly has gone to Niagara Falls. Clues suggest that a shapeshifter (called a \\"Lucifer\\") has taken Rosalind's form. Sebastian has no idea that the person he is eloping with is NOT Rosalind, but something that wants Sebastian's special abilities! Just so happens that Rosalind's mother is leader of the Ring of Knives. Once hearing of her daughter's murder, she set off for Niagara Falls. And to make things ever so peachy, the mighty Spark Lords are involved! (Think of them as an elite group of enforcers with AMAZING magical abilities, and no where close to being sane, that do whatever the Spark Protectorate tells them to.)<br /><br />**** Even though this is set in the 25th century, it starts out like a wild west movie with bars and fights. I was very disappointed as I read the first fifty pages. It soon became clear that this was the way the author chose to simply introduce Phil and his group of misfits. Once I, as the reader, knew the characters names and talents the story began picking up quickly. From then on I found myself absorbed by the story and its plot. Nothing could tear me away. All-in-all, this one is not as fascinating as the author's previous novel \\"Expendable\\", however, it is WELL worth your time and money to pick up and read. ****<br /><br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-03-18

During high school, Jada had a crush on Jack Harrington who was destined for stardom. So when Jack and his wife, Grace, asked her to write their biography, she agreed.  <br /> <br />The relationship between Jack Harrington and Grace Winslowe began much like a romantic movie. He was an up-and-comer in the movie business (putting TV series behind him) and she was a simple fifth grade teacher. Their worlds collided, literally, when they were in an automobile accident. Jack was fine, so was the third party, but Grace was hospitalized. The two are attracted to each other, but they have vast differences too, the biggest being religion.  <br /> <br />Now, against the backdrop of the entertainment world, Jada writes the story that all of Hollywood has been waiting for but the private couple kept to themselves. It will take Jada six months of close company with the couple to get the story. During that time, she learns how the famous couple grappled with their differences and won. But can she learn their story and NOT be affected?  <br /> <br />**** The story targets the famous couple, their backgrounds, and more until about three quarters of the way through. From then on, the main focus is Jack getting Jesus and how it affects both their lives. The title is marketed as \\"Fiction/Contemporary\\". However, this is what I call \\"Christian Fiction\\". Nothing on the back of the book tells potential buyers that the story is basically about Jack becoming a Christian. So if you do not like Christian books, avoid this one. If you DO like them, then this novel is MORE than worth your money. It is told by Jack and Grace. Each chapter alternates with their views from before they meet, through their blooming relationship, and up to the present day. Keep the tissues close at hand. There are a few scenes thatwill warm your heart. Recommended reading. ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-03-15

They attend the party in hopes of finding out what happened to them. They wish for their memories to be restored. <br />They begin their quest on the first floor where they are handed special visors to wear. The visors change the way their surroundings are viewed.

Together they locate the vital people from Project Immersion and convince them to help. Yet to do this, Phillip and Emily must actually enter the virtual world (without their visors) by having their minds connected by a quantum computer system. There they must confront their negative selves (split personalities). Only then may Project Immersion continue. <br />However, someone on an upper floor is trying to hack into their system. Secrets are still being kept from Phillip and Emily. This is going to be the longest night of their lives, if they survive it. <br />*** This is one of the most bizarre stories I have ever read. It combines sci-fi and the mysteries of the human mind. Sort of like self exploration gone bad. During the first seven floors, the reader is bombarded with names and gathering information. (No last names are ever given in the book.) Yet afterward, everything slowly begins to come together. The reader begins to understand what is happening. All I can say is \\"What a ride!\\" *** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-03-11

To protect the president she uses her own body as a shield and took the assassin's bullet.  <br /> <br />Tessa woke up nude, in the arms of a handsome man named Kahn. He tells her that she has been brought forward through time over three hundred years. Earth is so polluted that it is brown instead of blue. Earth plans to join the Galactic Federation who will help the planet clean itself. However, to join the Federation, Earth must choose one person to complete \\"the Challenge\\". If the chosen one wins, Earth wins. If the chosen one loses, Earth may not join or receive help. Tessa IS the Chosen One. Of course, Tessa believes none of it. But Kahn can prove it all.  <br /> <br />Kahn is from the planet Rystan. To seal Rystan as a full member of the Federation he must train Tessa to use the psi-abilities. He has only a few weeks in which to do it. At the same time, his nemesis, an Endekian named Jypeg, is out to kill them both.  <br /> <br />***** I have not read a book this great in a long time! The author created a brave hero and heroine, both warriors with talent, skill, and honor, added in a sentient computer that any \\"Star Trek\\" or \\"Star Wars\\" fan will envy, and pit them against overwhelming odds. The outcome is an action packed space adventure that readers will not EVER forget! I can hardly wait for Susan Kearney's next release to come out. (\\"The Dare\\" is due for release June 2005.)

Tyrell, Earl of Wesmont, believed his heart stopped working in Spain on the battlefields of Badajoz. So he is surprised when his heart keeps getting in the way when it comes to Fiona Hawthorn. Everyone, including Fiona, believes the lady to be jinxed. A few of her more famous nicknames are \\"Lady Fiasco\\", \\"the Duchess of Doom\\", and \\"the Countess of Calamity\\". Tyrell believes it is all superstitious nonsense. Yet he refuses to ever marry, especially her. This determination, along with his attraction to Fiona, causes him to act out at the lake and humiliate Fiona. When he goes to her home the next day to apologize, Tyrell learns from Lady Hawthorn (Fiona's stepmother) that the jinx left with her unpredictable Aunt Honore.<br /><br />Honore, Countess Alameda, takes Fiona to Brighton for a brief visit with Prinny, the Prince Regent. From there they plan to go to London where Fiona will reside with Aunt Honore. Honore tell everyone that Fiona is being groomed as her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e. She is delighted at the chaos that surrounds Fiona. Even better, Tyrell has arrived to make everything even more chaotic! What Aunt Honore did NOT foresee was her stepson, Lord Marcus, getting jealous of Fiona and deciding to get rid of the little chit.<br /><br />**** Aunt Honore stole the scene very often. I fell in love with the impish countess. Tyrell came across as too cruel once or twice, but seemed to get over his cowardice pretty fast. Once chasing Fiona and her aunt, he became simply hard headed and stubborn. I found this tale to be extremely amusing. The character of Fiona is a complex one. She is feisty, brave, but definitely has a run of bad luck. This book will please all Regency fans and often bring a smile to your face. Delightful. ****<br /><br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-03-07

It all depended on the female complement.  <br /> <br />Rhea Brown had the complement birthmark. She was the chance at unlimited powers of magick. And Rhea had NO CLUE of what she was!  <br /> <br />***** OH WOW! That says it all! Lots of witches, shape shifters, magic, and very explicit love scenes in this Dark Fantasy.

We return to Amoteh, a town in southwest Washington State. Danya is the last single Stepanov man. They are a family famous for the furniture they build with pride, as well as, for the luxurious Amoteh Resort.<br /><br />Danya's wife died nine years ago. He is now thirty-two years old. He has a business with one of his brothers as a builder and remodeler. Danya has not found a woman he could love since his wife died, but hoped to some day. Then he spies a lady unlike any other. She is at the grave site of Chief Kamakani, stripping off her clothes as she talks to deceased.<br /><br />Sidney \\"Sid\\" Blakely is a professional photographer (freelance) who has recently been jilted by a long time boyfriend. Sid and her sisters (Stretch and Junior) have been raised by their military father (Bulldog). The Blakely women detest anything overly feminine, such as dresses, cosmetics, anyone holding a door open for them, etc. Sid usually takes photos of things that put her in danger, such as an erupting volcano. However, to avoid her ex-boyfriend, she is at the Amoteh Resort with a group of ladies. Sid has been commissioned to photograph great shots of the ladies to be made into a calendar. (SO not her normal type of job!) To escape the models who are trying to give her a make over, Sid decides to camp out near Chief Kamakani's grave site.<br /><br />When Sid thinks Danya is about to suicide by jumping off a cliff, she begins talking him out of it. Danya begins using the misunderstanding as an excuse to spend time with her. The Stepanov men know quickly upon meeting a woman whether she is perfect for him or not. Danya is no exception. But Sid is not like other women. Thus Danya's courting must be done without Sid realizing what is happening.<br /><br />***** A wonderful conclusion for the Stepanov family story. I found it very interesting to watch Sid do so many masculine things while Danya attempt to out maneuver her (and her macho family). I find myself regretting that this is thelast of the \\"Heartbreaker miniseries\\". I can only hope that Cait London will begin a new romance series some day soon. *****<br /><br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-03-06

As attracted as Neville is, he notices her skittish actions and wonders if Penelope is really who she claims to be.  <br /> <br />**** All three stories are great and worth reading.

But she has only her beauty to recommend her. Using her exquisite fashion sense, she creates gowns that attract the eyes and dazzles the senses. The only fly in the ointment is her brother's friend, Lord St. Cleve \\"Valen\\". For some boorish, unknown reason he begins to figure out ways to humiliate her in society. He even arrives at a society function in outrageous apparel that matches her dress! Elizabeth refuses to let him stamp her down. She is doing what she feels she must.  <br /> <br />Valen finds the snobbish ways of the London society to be disgusting. After watching his grandfather making his mother's life miserable, he likes nothing more than to make fun at the Ton and all that they stand for. He believes Elizabeth to be the biggest snob of them all. Yet he cannot help but be attracted to her. Does not matter since his purse is not deep enough for her. He spies on what she purchases in order to match her dress and humiliate her. But then his spying ends up getting a shop keeper killed and Elizabeth almost strangled to death, right before his eyes. A man Valen (as \\"Red Hawk\\") has hunted for a long time believes Elizabeth is bait to lure him into one of Valen's traps. Knowing what the man has done to others, Valen is determined to sweep Elizabeth to safety. Only, in doing so, he learns that there is more to Elizabeth than he saw at first.  <br /> <br />***** I must admit that I found Elizabeth to be too arrogant at the beginning. However, I soon understood why she had to be that way. The author, Kathleen Baldwin, did an excellent job in letting me (as the reader) see and understand why both main characters acted the way they did. I certainly did not believe the two would suit. Shows how wrong I am! With subtle pen strokes Kathleen Baldwin mixes threads consisting of romance, believable characters with realistic traits, humor, and a bit of danger to create a wondrous painting that will linger in your mind'seye long after you finish the story.

It began when a few U.S. Senators wanted to reduce, and possibly eliminate, the Federal Deficit. They approached Fajah Labil who took on the congressional assignment to form an Advisory Group that worked closely with the senators. One of the first members of this group is Kilgor \\"Kyle\\" Schmidt.  <br /> <br />This book is written in the First Person with Kyle as the narrator. Kyle explains that the Advisory Group was to brainstorm for ideas on HOW to reduce the Debt. The answer? Create a Scientific Task Force (around a dozen people) to set up a nearly self-sufficient colony on the moon for the purpose of exploration and exploitation of any and all valuable mineral wealth located there.  <br /> <br />It is called Earth Moon: Colony One \\"EMCO\\". It begins with thirteen members. Readers watch the Pioneers struggle to simply survive. Then watch as mistakes are made, as well as, how the consequences are dealt with. Colonist soon begin arriving to help gather and ship back the minerals found. It is not too long before Earth hardly sends EMCO anything, yet EMCO continues to send Earth goods. The moon is not owned by any one country on Earth. The pioneers and Colonists develop their own laws and government over the years. Eventually people will marry, children will be born, and people on Earth will begin to envy.  <br /> <br />**** The first half of the book is set on Earth. The second half is set in EMCO, upon the moon. To avoid giving spoilers, my synopsis omits much. This book is labeled as \\"Action Romance\\" by the publisher. I disagree. There is not much romance and most of it is in the first half. This story strikes me as \\"Sci-Fi\\". It deals with a problem we see in the present time, but is dealt with in the future and in a way that COULD someday, possibly, happen. I am impressed with how well thought out the plot and sub-plots are. The author, Norman E. Gibat, has obviously pondered each problem, solution, and what-ifs. For readers who love details, it's in here. Readerswho do not want to read the tech stuff may skim. However, it is all written in such a way that you do not have to be a rocket scientist to understand it all. All-in-all, an excellent read but without much danger. ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-03-02

Lady Camelia \\"Tisha\\" Marshall is an archaeologist, like her father before her. She continues her father's work at their dig site, Pumulani (\\"Poo Moo Lanee\\"), in South Africa. She searches for the legendary Tomb of Kings. She is accompanied by Zareb, her African best friend who has guided and watched over her since she arrived in Africa at the tender age of ten. Lately, many \\"accidents\\" have rocked her site. The workers begin to believe the site is cursed. The rainy months have flooded the site and no one will sell or lease Tisha a steam pump to get rid of it, due to a monopoly by the De Beers Company who wishes to purchase Tisha's land from her. Her only hope is to travel to London, locate the brilliant inventor Simon Kent, and persuade him to part with the new type of pump he has invented. Of course, Zareb goes with her. So does Rupert (a two and a half foot long tiger snake), Harriet (a neurotic Grey Lourie bird), and Oscar (a mischievous, undisciplined monkey).  <br /> <br />Simon Kent did not hear the banging on his front door and would not have answered it even if he had. When inventing, Simon loses himself in his work. But when he turned around there she was, uninvited in his laboratory talking about a business proposition. Simon has too many inventions going on to consider stopping to help, no matter how beautiful and intelligent the odd lady is. He could not see how digging up old bones could possibly help the world. But someone out there does. Someone that will go to dangerous lengths to stop her, as well as anyone associated with her. Needless to say, Simon is soon traveling with Tisha and her strange companions to South Africa.  <br /> <br />***** Simon is one of the charming band of street urchins that was first introduced in \\"The Prisoner\\". That novel was followed by \\"The Wedding Escape\\" and \\"My Favorite Thief\\". Author Karyn Monk has endeared herself to thousands, if not millions, of readers by telling the love story of some of the now grown street urchins. Simon's tale is just as riveting as the others too! I found that I was unable to pull myself away for long. Tisha's animal friends often stole the show with their delightful antics and obvious intelligence. I did not want the story to end. I am counting the days until this author's next release. *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews	2005-03-01

While doing so, Avisa must not let herself be connected to St. Jude's Abbey in any way.  <br /> <br />Christian Lovell is a knight sworn to the service of King Henry \\"Curtmantle\\". His fondest wish is to cleanse the Lovell name of the dishonor brought on by his father. While en route to Canterbury, he \\"rescues\\" a damsel in distress. He has no idea that the damsel was sent to protect him. When Lady Avisa asks him to help rescue her sister, he agrees.

She finds herself desiring him in a way she cannot afford. And he is not making her resistance easy at all.  <br /> <br />***** Author Jocelyn Kelley has created a wondrous tale of love and honor set among one of the most troubling times of the past.

A Fairy Tail by Cindy Holbrook <br />The first of three tales takes up almost half the novel in length. It is also the best of the three, in my humble opinion. Blake Farewell is a powerful warlock. He is vain and goes through women. Marriage never enters his mind. At least, not until his father calls him in and informs him that he must wed a maiden who is half witch and half fey with a snowflake birthmark. He accepts his lot and starts out to make Alwayna love him. It should not take long. But Trillion wants all in the Farewell line to become slaves of the Fairies. To keep Blake from completing the quest in time, she turns Blake into an adorable black kitten. How can he possible make Alwayna fall in love with him if he is a kitten? Then he discovers that he has the power to turn back into his own form when he is alone with Alwayna. But time is short.  <br /> <br />A Bewitching Minx by Nancy Lawrence <br />The second tale is about a lord who blames his pretty new neighbor, Amelia, for the unearthly sounds in the middle of the night. They keep him awake. But Amelia blames him for the same sounds. Neither can figure out where the sounds are coming from. However, it is easy to tell that Ameila's kitten is full of matchmaking antics. This little kitten will enchant your heart and make you believe anything is possible.  <br /> <br />The Black Cat by Hayley Ann Solomon <br />The last tale is not as grand as the first two, but still quite amusing. A lord meets a lovely gypsy lady carrying a black cat who informs him that she is his destiny before she disappears. He has almost forgotten the lady when he wins the cat in a card game. He also won a lady, but refuses to accept that part of the wager. The cat, Venus, refuses to leave his side, even when he is out at social engagements. The cat leads him back to the mysterious beauty, but winning her hand is up to him. <br /> <br />***** All-in-all, a four star read. All three stories involve magic and charming kittens.

However, she defended a man accused of rapes (Hudson case), and won it, only to learn a few days later that he raped and killed another woman. Lindsey was devastated and blamed herself for the woman's death. She left her attorney career behind and joined the FBI. <br /> <br />Years pass... <br />Due to her father having cancer, Lindsey is forced to put her career with the Washington branch of the FBI on hold. Lindsey hopes to convince her father's ex-partner, Mark Reeves, to take the law firm over so she may return to Washington. Not only must Lindsey deal with her father's firm, at least for awhile, but he left her with the Williams case. She feels unable to deal with the Williams case because it is identical to the Hudson one. Even eerier, all the victims, from BOTH cases, look exactly like Lindsey.  <br /> <br />Mark Reeves and Lindsey's father did NOT get along. He could care less about the firm or Edward. When Lindsey shows up at his Manhattan address he tells her so in no uncertain terms. But Lindsey, herself, intrigues Mark. He will help her and the firm out for six months, but she must remain too. During that time, HE hopes to get closer to Lindsey and SHE hopes to convince him to keep the firm. The Williams case is high profile. More than just the media is watching Lindsey. Someone else watches her every move and bides his time.  <br /> <br />***** Author Lisa Renee Jones has written a Contemporary Suspense romance that reminds me a lot of Jayne Ann Krentz's early books. I seldom find novels such as this one these days. I challenge anyone to figure out the killer's identity. There are many suspects to choose from. The main characters are believable, as well as the secondary ones. This makes everything blend smoothly together for a story you will remember long after you close the book. *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-02-16

The Crow Queen was to watch for the arrival of the one named Auglar of Kellsjard, a lord of Jenel. Auglar MUST live through all that would soon come to pass.  <br /> <br />Londah had been nicknamed the Crow Queen, because the carrion birds of Segg had surely grown fat on all the corpses she left in her wake. She was the best assassin to be hired. None were as silent or swift as she. To be a bodyguard went against all she knew, but she had her own reasons for agreeing.  <br /> <br />Jenel could not afford to remain leaderless, without a monarch, for much longer. To be crowned King of Jenel, Lord Auglar must convince the Council of Lords that he is worthy. Yozerf, a wolfkin, joined his love, a human named Suchen, and the Sworn for the journey to the deadly city known as Nava Ner in Segg. Yozerf had grown up in the city and knew the horrors within. Suchen is Lord Auglar's Steward. Yozerf would never have returned to the vile place on his own. But to protect Suchen, Yozerf would do anything.  <br /> <br />Betrayed by other lords, they soon find themselves on the run, trapped in the city with enemies everywhere. It is up to the Crow Queen and Yozerf to get them out alive.  <br /> <br />***** Book 1 is titled \\"Wolfkin\\". You do not HAVE to read the first book to understand this one. Yet if you wish the full effect, I strongly suggest that you do so. If you enjoy Fantasy books with wizards, the undead, or shape-shifters, then rejoice! This book has all three and so much more besides.  <br /> <br />From the beginning until the end this story goes at full speed. No one seems to be as they claim and everyone seems to have secrets, Yozerf more than others. There will be a third book to round out the tale, but this story ties up most the strings. Nothing major will leave you hanging in a lurch, but there are a few loose ends.Excellent tale and recommended to all fans of Fantasy! *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews. <br />	2005-02-10

Yozert Jonaglir is half Aclytese (an ancient race of dragon fire sorcerers) and Half Wolfkin (a race that can shift to wolf form). He has been separated from his group during the Segg battle. Still in wolf form, Yozerf is all but dead when a small, human, orphan girl finds him. Once well enough, Yozerf returns to man form. The girl, Owl, and Yozerf have become close. In a ceremony (Yozert makes up), the two use a few drops of their blood to adopt each other. Yozerf has no idea that his blood would affect his new daughter in special ways. As father and daughter, the two begin traveling in hopes of finding a city to take shelter from the ongoing war between the cruel King Fellrant of Jenel and the equally ruthless Emperor Jahcgroth of the Argannese. No matter which side ultimately wins the war, all the people lose.  <br /> <br />During the travel of the duo, Yozerf rescues some human refugees, then some Aclyte refugees, followed by Wolfkin refugees, and so on. The three races have never gotten along. But for survival they did so, banding together to help each other (though reluctantly at first) with Yozerf as their unspoken leader. Leader is NOT what Yozerf wishes for. However, it is a role he takes seriously. With Winter coming, they needed shelter for the group of over one hundred. Yozerf sets his sights on Vorslava.  <br /> <br />Suchen Keblava is Yozerf's human mate. She is part of the group he has been separated from. Yozerf's mother, Londah, is with her. The entire group believes him dead. They are now homeless refugees with both war leaders out for their heads. Word is spreading about the new bandit lord ruling Vorslava who is taking in all refugees. They arrive to find Yozerf is ruling several hundred people of all races.  <br /> <br />The group must survive the Winter, keep peace within their walls, as well as prepare for Spring. Because when Spring arrives, the small warrior groups within Vorslava and their rag tag kingdom of refugees will have to battle King Fellrant and Emperor Jahcgroth's magical armies.  <br /> <br />***** I could not shorten that synopsis and still explain the plot. Yet I have given nothing vital away. The duo's journey to Vorslava is littered with battles and hardships. Do not assume Vorslava was empty of soldiers upon their arrival either. Even when everyone is together, keeping peace between races with several generations of war between them is not a breeze to do.  <br /> <br />Author Elaine Corvidae is somehow able to pull it all off without ripping all her hair out by its roots. This is the last of the trilogy. The first book is \\"Wolfkin\\" (ISBN # 1594260540). The second book is \\"The Crow Queen\\" (ISBN # 1594260575). Both the previous titles must be read in order for you to full understand the characters (good and bad), their histories, their triumphs, and their defeats. Otherwise, this single book will make sense to you, but you will find yourself wondering to what they are referring to very often. Each book is excellent. Fans of Anne McCaffrey will especially enjoy this trilogy. Elaine Corvidae is a Mistress of Fantasy! *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-02-10

Rachel Goodman never thought she would return to Pilgrim Cove. The memories growing up there were very unpleasant. After thirteen years on her own, Rachel was an assistant principal at a school in Kansas. But when a tornado totally destroyed the school, it left her without a job.  <br /> <br />Lou Goodman, Rachel's father, convinced her to apply for a new position at her old school. Pilgrim Cove Regional High School has recently gotten back the standardized test scores and the results were horrible. Students' scores have taken a sharp nose dive within the last three years. Dr. Bennett and the school board is charging Rachel with improving the academic performance of the entire student body. All eyes will be on Rachel. If she succeeds, the position will become permanent. So Rachel prepares herself to face her past.  <br /> <br />Dr. Jack Levine is a marine biologist. While taking samples of Pilgrim Cove's ocean areas for a year, he will also hold a position as the science teacher. This makes Rachel his boss. They are quickly attracted to each other, but Jack does not follow rules or take advice, which will cause all sorts of problems.  <br /> <br />Bart Quinn rents the top apartment of Sea View House to Jack. It is perfect for both the man's jobs. Bart rents the bottom apartment to Rachel. Perfect for her to indulge in her favorite past time, swimming, and walking on the beach.  <br /> <br />The ROMEOs have seen two couples find true happiness while renting Sea View House. They have high hopes that the house will work its magic a third time. It has GOT to, because this time it is for one of their own!  <br /> <br />***** First book in the Pilgrim Cove series is the story of Laura and Matt (The House on the Beach). Second book is the story of Shelley and Daniel (No Ordinary Summer). This time it is the story of Rachel and Jack! The first two stories were breathtaking and I love them still. Ending each and having to leave Pilgrim Cove broke my heart. The series is justso awe-inspiring to me.! When I learned a third book had been released, I actually let out a short, high-pitched, squeal in pleasure.  <br /> <br />Linda Barrett is an astonishing contemporary author! Even though the entire town of Pilgrim Cove seems to be secondary characters, the author manages to keep the focus on the two main characters and the obstacles they must, somehow, overcome. As the reader, I could easily believe the town and all its inhabitants were real. I came to feel as though I was a part of this close-knit town. This accomplishment is something all authors strive for, but few actually achieve. Linda Barrett is one of those few! Do NOT miss out on Pilgrim Cove! *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-02-09

Sonja Sankova attends a Christmas party hosted by Tsar Nicholas I. She did not really wish to attend, but it is unwise to say no to the Tsar. Peter Koslov \\"Colonel Cut\\", commander of the Wolfpack, is enthralled with Sonja and begins telling awful, bloody tales to impress her. Instead of being impressed, she ends up slugging him with a roundhouse right cross, which the Tsar finds hilarious. Koslov vows he will someday have her ears on a necklace for the offense. Sonja and her father flee.  <br /> <br />That same night, in London, Jack Sandt meets with Karl Marx to conspire about conning the Tsar into letting Jack take daguerreotype images into Russia. Jack and Sonja meet while she is disguised as a boy. They end up fleeing with each other while Koslov and the Wolfpack pursue them.  <br /> <br />**** Toward the beginning of the novel the scenes change too often. However, soon the plot and characters of this story entice the reader to settle down and enjoy several hours of fictional bliss. Once Sonja and Jack meet, things do not seem to hop around so often and scenes become smoother. From then on, everything is non-stop action. Recommended reading. ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-02-03

She is defending a famous, high profile, client and the client's agent. Her rival prosecutor is hunky Tom Markham from the county attorney's office. As Mac gets her defense ready, she comes across some information that could ruin her client. By law, Mac must share the information with Tom. However, before she can do so her BMW just happens to go off a cliff. Pure luck alone keeps Mac from dying. But she did not come out unscathed. Mac now has amnesia. She remembers nothing about the law, nothing about her family or friends (though friends are rare since she stepped on toes in her profession), or even where she lives! Her two friends, Nell and Jane, fill in her name, address, and the small things. But even they cannot convince Mac she is sane, because her cat, Nefertiti \\"Titi\\", seems to speak English to her now. Everyone else just hears normal cat sounds. Mac and Titi understand each other perfectly though. And now that Mac understands, Titi has a lot to say about Mac's workaholic ways, how to relax, and which guy to date.  <br /> <br />Tom may be Mac's rival in court, but he has always been interested in dating her. She turned him down once and he would not try again, except that Mac needs help. As her memory slllooowwly comes along, Tom helps her try to switch on the \\"legal jargon\\" portion of her brain. The two now have a second chance with each other. <br /> <br />Problem is that someone out there does not want Mac's memory to return. It is up to the feisty feline, Titi, to take matters into her own paws.  <br /> <br />*** I found this novel to be pretty entertaining. The brain does some interesting things when it is harmed, so the author makes the relationship between Mac and Titi sound believable. There is not much suspense in this tale. The main portion of the story is split between Tom and Mac's second chance at love and on Mac finding out who she really is. The story slowed down for a bit about mid way, but not for long. The author just wanted to show you Mac's family, to let you see WHY the heroine was the way she was before the car wreck. It also gives the romance a bit more time to bloom.  <br /> <br />The author rarely touched on Mac's sister, the nurse. However, I found myself wanting to know more about her. Hopefully, the sister will get her own story told someday (unless it is out and I do not know about it). I snagged this novel at an airport, so I have not kept up with this author's books. (I hope that will change.) Yet this book seems to be part of a trilogy. I am guessing Jane and Nell get their stories published. The front cover advertises that the author also wrote \\"Gone To The Dogs\\". So this is probably the second book in the trilogy.  <br /> <br />All-in-all, I found this to be a fun, witty, and entertaining book. A good read for a snowy afternoon or saving for the beach months. ***  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-02-02

This time Jill had been meeting Chase (the chauffeur's son that Dory had a major crush on) in secret. When Dory's dad (Del) and Chase's dad (Charles) caught them, Chase was sent off to college. Dory's mother (Drusilla), who pampered Jill but only tolerated her, grounded Dory for spying while she and Jill flew to visit relatives in London. They returned with James Darwood. Drusilla nagged Del until he gave James a job in his bank, even though James had been fired from a London bank for pilfering the till. Needless-to-say, while Del and Drusilla were off in the Caribbean, James and Marilyn (Jill's best friend) stole $34.6 million in a wire transfer from the bank Del owned to a bank in Belize. Then the couple disappeared.  <br /> <br />US Attorney Marshall Philips froze Del's assets, but could not touch the things Del's sister (Aunt Ping) had in her name, which was quite a bit. Since Marshall could not locate James and he was mad at Aunt Ping, he quit looking for James and was waiting for Del to return to the States so he could be arrested. Thus, he kept FBI agents following Dory, Jill, and Aunt Ping. Of course, Del and Drusilla must remain in Isla Rica until James could be captured.

He wants his father to retire. But Charles absolutely refuses. Dory never got over her childhood crush on Chase.Yet, once again, Chase has eyes only for Jill's beauty (just like every other male that still breathes).  <br /> <br />***** Yes, it is necessary to be that detailed in the synopsis. But trust me, I really gave away nothing vital. If you love witty novels with strong characters such as in \\"Scruples\\", \\"I'll Take Manhattan\\", and \\"Princess Daisy\\", then you will ADORE this book! I fell in love with Jamie (whether he was age 3 or 10 at the time). I admired Dory and Aunt Ping. My opinion of Jill and Chase kept changing. And the Feds are great. Dory and her staff kept the Feds, and me, laughing with the codes and nicknames they used for each other on the walkie talkies. Oh please do not miss this delightful novel! *****	2005-01-25

Rae learns that she has inherited half of his estate. Dr. Gregory's son, Michael, inherited the other half. Rae and Michael are by no means strangers.

What if the androids were better than their human creators? What if an advanced A.I. was developed with absolutely no encouragement or help from mankind? What if the net, the backbone of the human world, revealed itself to be sentient?  <br /> <br />Kat is an android. She is a Summerstone prototype, GenEight. Doctor Melanie \\"Mel\\" Chauvin, Head of Research and Design at Summerstone, created her. However, the military took Kat and one other GenEight away from Mel. So Mel is surprised when her new intern, Jane, is Kat in disguise!  <br /> <br />Kat wakes up in the middle of a field. The military had wiped her memory, as well as her higher functions. Kat was not supposed to ever wake up. But Kat has overcome her programming. She adapts to her situation, blends in with the humans, and is on a journey to find out what happened to her.  <br /> <br />Summerstone is the most powerful company within the \\"Big Ten\\". These companies employ over 75% of the entire world. They actually own the military and the governments. They send a contract killer after Kat and anyone else that get in their way. The public must not find out that the androids are evolving. If they do, the Big Ten will fall and the economy of the entire world will crumble.  <br /> <br />**** A very good debut novel. This is one other main character who is referred to only as \\"I\\". He spends most of his time plugged into a terminal at a virtual reality bar, conversing with the sentient net. Author Cavan Terrill created a realistic scenario based on the hypothesis that someday machines may out grow their human creators. Many books and movies have been made on this, but this novel is the first time that I have seen anyone use the bases and NOT have the machines trying to take over the world or kill off the humans. Cavan Terrill clearly shows that there is another option. Perhaps the androids, the machines, simply want to be considered a new race. The possibilities are mind-boggling. This is an author to keep an eye on! ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-01-13

Readers learn about Halloween carnivals, home remedies, making toothbrushes from a sassafras bush, listening to radio shows, mad dogs, and even about Hog Killing Day. June's favorite thing to do is to read. Through her books and a few visitors, June learns that good grammar and a strong vocabulary can equal power. June's best friend is PeeDee Rednell.

Timothy Crawford may be a viscount, but he loves to build things. So even though his grandfather, the Earl of Brookindale, continuously tells him to let the business men run the family businesses, Timothy just has to keep his hands in the work. To sooth the Earl, Timothy and his cousin, Felix Wayne, tells the Earl that Timothy has found the woman of his dreams. Timothy names this non-existent lady Serenity Adams. When the Earl insists on meeting the woman Timothy knows he is in trouble. He is expected to present his wonderful fiance during the Earl's seventieth birthday celebration on Christmas Eve. Fearing he will be disinherited, Timothy still decides to do the right thing. He will go to the Earl and tell the truth. So Timothy and Felix depart on a journey to Cheyney Park.  <br /> <br />\\"Fate\\" is not only a fickle lady, but one with a sense of adventure. This is proven when the two gentlemen find an overturned carriage. All within the carriage are dead. However, one lady had been thrown out. The men believe her to be the lady's maid of one of the deceased. There is nothing around to identify any of them. The sole survivor did not escape totally uninjured. She has no memory. Since she matches the image of the fantasy fiance, Felix seizes the opportunity that Fate has given them and convinces the woman to masquerade as Timothy's \\"Serenity\\" until after the holidays.  <br /> <br />***** This is, in my opinion, the BEST regency romance that Jo Ann Ferguson has written thus far! Readers may enjoy this tale at any time of year, because Christmas is only mentioned during the scenes of decorating and because the Earl's birthday is around the same time. The author focus on the main characters, Timothy and Serenity, and not on the season.  <br /> <br />Many authors add a child to the story so s/he will touch the heart of the reader. Usually, the child is mean, spoiled, or mute. Apparently the author is as tired of these scenarios as the readers are. Yet the holiday seasonseems more special with children around. This dilemma is neatly stepped around by what must be a wonderful brain storm on the author's part. Meet Theodora who is ten-years-old but looks six. For reasons revealed in the story, \\"Uncle Timothy\\" and the Earl placed the child in the care of a nurse since birth. She cannot use her legs. One arm/hand does not work. The other arm/hand has limited movement. She is friendly, smart, very observant, and definitely NOT mute. You cannot miss what you never knew, so she is content in her room. Of course, Serenity is NOT content and goes about changing things for the better.  <br /> <br />Did the author stop there? She could have and this would have still been a \\"five star\\" regency tale. Instead a subtle sub-plot is added. This novel proves that Jo Ann Ferguson has a shining talent for writing in the Regency genre! Highly recommended for ANY time of year. I recommend that it be read during the colder season for atmosphere though. *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-01-06

Since the age of nineteen she's been plagued with chilling sensations, premonitions of disasters before they occurred, and could sense the residue of rage left in a room. She convinces herself that the feelings are not real. <br />Marlo's New Age girlfriend, Cherry Parker, knows differently. Cherry has studied the psychic phenomenon for years, wishing she had \\"the gift\\". So Cherry knows Marlo has it, no doubt, no matter how often Marlo swears otherwise. <br />Spence Gerhard lost his sister, Traci, and his tiny nephew, Cody, almost three years ago when they had been run off a mountain pass road and killed. Cody's remains had never been found. Spence still searches, feeling guilt that he had been unable to help Traci and Cody back then. More guilt piled upon him when his mother died in the kitchen from what seemed to be her falling off a step ladder while changing a bulb. Strange thing is that her old camera disappeared at the same time, along with some old photos. <br />Sweet, scheduled, professional Marlo wants only to keep her sane life running smoothly. But someone was prowling the city of Godfrey, stealing cameras and photographs. This someone was out to conceal a twelve year old secret. One that had caused murder a few times already and will again. Only by Marlo opening herself up to her special gift and placing her trust in the hands of Spence, who has hurt her before, can she ever hope to overcome the spreading darkness. <br />***** Author Cait London has another winner in this suspense filled drama. The sudden ringing of my telephone had me jumping whenever I found myself in a tense scene. Now THAT is talent! The author gave Marlo and Spence a past that made their present relationship quite bumpy. And to make matters even more heavy, Spence is not the only man Marlo is seeing, though it is obvious to the reader that Spence IS the main man. So pull up a comfortable chair, give yourself a lot of lighting, and make sure you have plenty of free time before you even begin reading page one of this novel.

None of it makes much sense to the reader. Soon Special Agent John Garrett helps Elektra narrate. The reader then sees things happen from the point-of-view of Elektra and Garrett. Things still make little sense to the reader; however, a pattern begins to form and the reader can now piece a few things together.  <br /> <br />Half way through this comic novel (over sized paperback), more characters begin to help narrate. Yet only one of the newer characters play a major role in clearing the air for the reader. That character is Agent Chastity McBryde, who seems almost as insane as Elektra. By the ending, the reader fully understands it all and is left utterly speechless!  <br /> <br />If you plan to watch the January 2005 movie release \\"Elektra\\", read this first! Elektra is NOT a \\"super hero\\" and the movie does not try to portray her as one. Quit thinking \\"Dare Devil\\", \\"Spider Man\\", and/or \\"Batman\\". Elektra is totally unique.

Once Lucky was hired by Jacey he began using his street smarts and connections to help complete their cases.<br />They are both attracted to each other. To Jacey, Lucky's bayou charm and dark aura is striking. To Lucky, Jacey is too high class for someone like himself. Yet he admires her wit, dedication to her job, and she is drop dead gorgeous. Therefore, they are only business associates. Yet during their three years together they have become very good friends. <br />Now that is all about to change. A local shipping magnate, J. Walter Garvey is dying. The strong willed man refuses to tell his family and is close to none of them. He hires Jacey to investigate all his family members so he may decide which of them, if any, he will leave the running of his empire to. To make things complicated, word has somehow leaked out about Garvey hiring Jacey and why. None of the family members look great, but one of them is connected to Vinny. The simple research case has just become deadly. <br />***** There are two sub-plots running underneath the main one to keep things lively in this story.

Here is a short book of poetry that you will read (over and over) for a long length of time. Instead of writing poetry on just life, fiction, and/or \\"what ifs\\", the author writes on the varieties of emotions.<br />I read one or two poems each night before bed. Then I allowed myself to sleep on it. Sometime during the next day my mind would think back to what I had read the night before. I came to realize that the author, Milena Alvarez, did not just write about her own emotions, but about MINE! The collection proved to me that by fully opening herself to her own emotions, Milena Alvarez could more easily see and understand the emotions in others.<br />***** The old saying \\"Never judge a book by its cover\\" holds true in this case. The cover has an attractive color scheme; however, it does not really draw the eye from anyone who may be simply passing by the Poetry section. (Perhaps if the cover looked more like an old journal?)

Sir Daniel Braeburn offers for her hand, not out of any love or passion, but as a practical solution to her brother, Jerome. Logical Willa decides to test her prospective fiancé before committing herself. To that end, upon seeing a man in the garden and thinking it to be Daniel she takes off her spectacles and begs a kiss. However, it is not Daniel who kisses her, but his prodigal brother, Alexander. Willa's experimental results: No wedding!

I am guessing it is the date in which each individual poem was written. The book covers the entire Bush era of events and challenges every aspect of politics around the world. Here is one example. It is the last paragraph of the poem titled \\"Texas Wrangler\\" that begins on page 86.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />\\"This Texas wrangle  <br />lassoes you  <br />and your losses  <br />into his and their pockets  <br />then happily portfolios  <br />all the way to the bank  <br />on  <br />U.S.\\"  <br /> <br /> <br />The poetry touches on war, terrorism, laws, world leaders, violence, Iraq, and more.

However, if you look closely at the details, you may find yourself either chilled by the innuendos or absolutely revolted.  <br /> <br />** Any group discussion on this book is bound to ignite tempers.

Human creators granted them the initiative of a rock and a literal-mindedness which, coupled with multiple layers of override programming, had made them totally dependent upon humans for directions. A rogue Bolo is, of course, worse than any possible nightmare. The Dinochrome Brigade had spent decades hunting down abandoned and obsolescent Bolos from the Mark XX to Mark XXIII series and burning out their command centers to prevent rogue (faulty) possibilities.  <br /> <br />Captain Paul Merrit had once, on Sandlot, forgotten that a Bolo is a machine. But now he has a second chance. Merrit is sent to the planet called Santa Crus, \\"out in the middle of nowhere.\\" Ursula Central has finally noticed a \\"sleeping\\" Bolo there. Merrit's duty is to locate the Bolo, inspect it, and assume command if it is still operational. The Bolo has been in Stand-By mode for close to eighty years. Central never realized that there has not been any real Navy personnel on the planet's base in all that time either.  <br /> <br />However, Merrit locates the Bolo (nicknamed \\"Nike\\"). Nike is special in that he is more self-aware than any other Bolo. Nike is an experimental prototype that has emotions and keeps her high alertness even when not in battle mode.  <br /> <br />The GalCorp company is run by Madam Osterwelt. She sends her only son, Gerald, to Santa Cruz to buy up land ... ALL land ... the entire planet. Yet to do so, Gerald must get rid of the three things that stand in the way: civilians, Merrit, and Nike. But Nike is having none of it!  <br /> <br />Story 2: The Traitor  <br /> <br />This is a short story. One Bolo is tracking down another Bolo that seems to have deserted during battle - something Bolos are supposed to be unable to do.  <br /> <br />Story 3: With Your Shield <br /> <br />Lieutenant Maneka Trevor is sent to Fort Merrit on Santa Cruz for her first command (ever) of a Bolo, \\"Benjy\\". As Trevor learns from her team about strategy, she learns even more about her own human race from Benjy.  <br /> <br />Story 4: A Time To Kill <br /> <br />The Final War saw the Concordiat of Man and the Melconian Empire end in fire and death. Humans and Melconians had finally wiped each other out. A hand full of survivors are all that is left of each race. The Humans settle on the planet where the last mission, Operation Ragnarok (the massacre of ALL Melconians on the planet) took place. Only the ruins of cities from decades ago and the husks of a few Bolos remain.  <br /> <br />One Bolo, \\"Shiva\\", is slowly coming back on line. The timing could not have been better either. The last remaining Melconians, in dying ships, have no choice but to land and try to survive. Which race will win the right to live? <br /> <br />Story 5: A Brief Technical History Of The Bolo - From Bolos In Their Own Words <br /> <br />This is exactly what it sounds like. This section tells about each Bolo created. However, it is supposedly compiled AFTER \\"Story 4\\". The Bolos put together this section based upon the data it could piece together. Much information was lost after the \\"Longest Night\\".  <br /> <br />**** The first story consumes half the novel space. It is also the best story in the collection. Though the Bolo series was created by author Keith Laumer, David Weber did an exemplarily job with this off-shoot. If you have never read any of the Bolo novels, you may find yourself rushing out to purchase them. This is very well done indeed. ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-01-03

He is currently imprisoned on a ship only a short distance off-shore from the city of Plymouth. When Brianca Dunsworthy learns of this she sees red! Her brother, Kevin, had died while on the Continent. Though indirectly, she blames Napoleon for his death. She wants nothing more than to meet him face-to-face and tell him exactly what she thinks of him.  <br /> <br />Brianca and Rosie Dunsworthy are the daughters of a deceased spendthrift baron. When Kevin died, the title went to a cousin. Aunt Millicent, who is only about ten years older than Brianca, took charge of the two sisters. They reside in the Dunsworthy Dower Cottage by the shore. During an extremely bad storm one night, as Brianca entertains the other two Dunsworthy ladies with a story, they find a man at their door. He is barely conscious and has a festering gun shot wound in his arm.  <br /> <br />Lucian Wandersee, fourth Earl of Wandersee, has been wounded in a duel. He and his coachee, Moss, are traveling in secret to the country when he is laid low by a raging fever. Lucian awakens to find himself recuperating in a country cottage in the care of Brianca Dunsworthy. She is the loveliest and most outspoken young woman he has ever met. When he realizes she is trying to pair him up with her shy sister, he decides to turn the tables on her.  <br /> <br />**** Brianca, Rosie, and Aunt Millicent each have their own story. This one is Brianca's. The hero and heroine of this novel are both sharp witted, as well as, hard headed. This makes for some very entertaining clashes. The story's main focus is on Lucian and the Dunsworthy ladies. This is fantastic! However, the sub plot on Napoleon is a bit weak. I could not help but feel that Brianca was portrayed as smart in everything EXCEPT when it came to Napoleon. I could not bring myself to believe that such a smart lady could be so foolish as to think she could just walk up to Napoleon, give him a polite scolding, and actually think he would suddenly feel guilt or grief at causing such havoc to so many.  <br /> <br />As I read the story, I saw several secondary characters for possible matches for Rosie and Millicent. The author did a terrific job of building each character I came across. Unlike most other novels, Jo Ann Ferguson does not spend pages on the background and history of characters that readers will not see but once or twice. No filler pages and fluff here! This author sticks to the main characters and thoroughly entertains her readers by giving them what they want most, clashes between the main two characters and romance! ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-12-30

The ex-cheerleader married politically aspiring Jason Carson. Four years later they divorced. Blair got everything she asked for in the settlement thanks to a single photograph of him kissing her seventeen-year-old sister. She uses the money to follow her dream of opening a coed fitness center, \\"Great Bods\\". It is a huge success. Blair not only loves her business, but she actually cares for her staff and customers. All except for Nicole \\"Nikki\\" Goodwin. Nikki joins Great Bods and began to mimic Blair. Nikki colors her hair the same color, grows it long, purchases a similar car, and even buys the same workout clothes (all the way down to the leg warmers). But everyone, even the members of the gym, could tell that Nikki pure hates Blair. Many members of the gym complains about Nikki's attitude too and files formal complaints. So when time came for Nikki to renew, Blair simply pulls out the complaints and gently refuses to let Nikki renew her membership. Nikki's exit is violent, though she never hits anyone. That very night, as Blair locks up and leaves the building, Nikki is shot dead in the parking lot. Blair did not get a good look at the killer, but just being a witness is enough.<br /><br />The police lieutenant, Jefferson \\"Wyatt\\" Bloodsworth, a man Blair once dated and to whom she is still very much attracted to, enters the picture. The media, of course, promptly put Blair on the front page and told the public that she witnessed the murder. NOT GOOD! Needless-to-say, the next gunshot Blair hears is directed at her. Nikki had been a case of mistaken identity. Now Wyatt and Blair must figure out who wants to kill her before they actually succeed.<br /><br />***** This novel has plenty of romance, but is overflowing with suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The author, Linda Howard, writes the story as if Blair is actually talking to the reader. With Blair's witty mind and \\"don't mess with me, I'm no push over\\" attitude, I found myself actually laughing aloud often. I highly recommend this one for anyone going on vacation and wanting something wonderful to read. I specify to those on vacation because you may find yourself staying up late at night to read and will want to sleep late the next morning. Excellent! *****<br /><br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.h me, I'm no push over\\" attitude, I found myself actually laughing aloud often.

Sir Daniel Braeburn offers for her hand, not out of any love or passion, but as a practical solution to her brother, Jerome. Logical Willa decides to test her prospective fianc before committing herself. To that end, upon seeing a man in the garden and thinking it to be Daniel she takes off her spectacles and begs a kiss. However, it is not Daniel who kisses her, but his prodigal brother, Alexander. Willa's experimental results: No wedding! Daniel cannot compare to the heat and desire Alex stirs within her.  <br /> <br />Alexander \\"Alex\\" Braeburn is dozing in the garden. When the shapely young beauty begs for his kiss, he believes himself dreaming and obliges her ... more than once. But a lady such as Willa is made for marriage and he has no interest in such. Once back in London, he can forget all about her.  <br /> <br />Enter Willa's Aunt Honore! Lady Alameda takes Willa as her protge and whisks her off to London for a Season.

(And she does it so well!) <br /> <br />Sure enough, Alex claims he has no desire to marry, yet as others begin to vie for her affections (even his own two best friends), Alex realizes that losing Willa to anyone else would be the greatest mistake of all.  <br /> <br />***** Wonderful reading for Regency fans!

The frail twin went to a rich couple, so she could receive any medical treatments she may need. The strong twin went to a poor couple on the wrong side of tracks. Twenty-one years pass...<br /><br />In Falcon's Bend, Wisconsin, Lieutenant Pete Shasta is thinking only about seducing his wife when his partner, Danny Vincent, shows up at the door about a murder. The body of a stripper from \\"Danse de Minuit\\", a gentleman's club, has been found in the park. Pete and Danny soon realize that the investigation will not be a quick. The club has only about a half dozen \\"dancers\\". Oddly, they all live in the same house as the club's owner, Andre Trelawney, and his timid wife, Melody. None of the dancers will talk without Andre's permission. They all seem to be either in love with Andre or to loathe him. Andre has the birth certificate of each dancer, showing all to be of legal age. Yet they physically look like minors. Stranger still, the wife is an identical twin of one of the dancers and acts as though she fears her husband. Of course Pete and Danny cannot prove that any prostitution is going on. Nor can they prove the ladies are younger than their birth certificates claim. However, none of the ladies have any solid history before two years ago. None of them has a checking account either. They DO have savings accounts, but all deposits have been made by Andre and there has never been a single withdrawal.<br /><br />Everyone seems to have a motive for killing the victim. The case is going to be difficult to solve. The worst things are that Andre seems to be extremely possessive of ALL his dancers and Danny is falling in love with Melody. The atmosphere is pregnant with danger and the possibility of another murder is high.<br /><br />***** Here is a \\"who dunnit\\" that will intrigue all mystery fans! It is loaded with twists and turns to keep you guessing until close to the end. Every time I thought that I had figured it out another juicy surprise would pop up. The novel focuses mainly on the case. The subplot, involving Danny, is pretty subtle but seems to round out the novel wonderfully. I can only hope that the authors allow me to visit the town of Falcon's Bend again in the near future. *****<br /><br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-12-27

Warren, her husband of fifteen years, suddenly announced that he was divorcing her, and moving to Cottonmouth to be with his married sweetheart, Cookie. It was just too much for even timid little Roberta to handle. It was time for a change. It was time for some revenge!  <br /> <br />Roberta shortens her name to Bobbie, dyes and whacks off her hair (TO THE EARS), quits her accounting job, sells her home, trades her expensive car for a \\"bug\\", get rid of her conservative clothes for a wardrobe totally opposite, and moves to Cottonmouth to show Warren what he has given up. To top things off, Bobbie gets a job as a waitress at the local caf and moves into a little home directly across from an alleged serial killer, Nick Angel. But why stop there? The NEW Bobbie would not! So Bobbie sets her sites on getting the serial killer into her bed.  <br /> <br />In small town Cottonmouth, everyone thinks they know everything about each other. So all eyes are watching to see whether Bobbie will date the serial killer or the local policeman. And which of the (not quite divorced) Spiveys will kill their spouse.  <br /> <br />***** Unlike most romances, this one takes a different twist by having the leading lady already married to someone else and the leading man has a dangerous looking past. To make matters more interesting, the author introduces Cookie, a villainess that you cannot help but love to hate...and soap operas would dearly love to have in their shows! A witty novel that will keep you engrossed until the very end! *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-12-27

Instead, the young viscount is met by even more noise. Some comes from his mother, who wishes him to settle down, and some comes from his sister, Olivia, who is excited about going to a Valentine's Day ball in hopes of receiving a marriage proposal from Lord Raymond Marlowe. To escape it all Jason rides a day away from home and takes a room at a cozy inn. All is well until his valet opens a wrong door and allows three miscreant kittens into another guest's room.  <br /> <br />Miss Amaris Woodward, escorted by her abigail, is en route to the ball when her carriage breaks down. She gets a room at the inn for the night. Amaris has been sent by her ailing father to the ball where Raymond is to announce their engagement. But her carriage is not the only mishap of the night. She returns to her room to find her ball gown in shreds due to the three kittens. Since Jason's valet is responsible for the damage, Jason is moved to make things right by repairing the gown and giving Amaris a ride to her destination ... even though the lovely lady's arrival will break his sister's heart.  <br /> <br />***** Who would ever dream that such innocent looking kittens could cause so much trouble? Or so much love? The answer can be found within the pages of this book. Three authors are able to see through the cuddly smiles and angelic \\"mews\\" to see the playfulness and intelligence behind them. These stories are the authors' attempts in showing readers a glimpse of what they see.  <br /> <br />There are two other novellas in this book by authors Valerie King and Cynthia Pratt.

It only took one call for him to recognize her talent. Isabel is paid very well for her talent in analyzing the dreams of three special clients.

He works for a highly classified government agency with an interest in the potential value of lucid dreaming. His boss (Jack Lawson, one of the other two clients) informed Ellis that Dr. Belvedere has died and wants him to make contact with Isabel Wright. (Belvedere's son has taken over the business. Firing Isabel and getting rid of the dream department is one of his first decisions.) Jack wants Isabel on his payroll. Ellis has always been amazed at how well Isabel interprets his dreams. She has helped the agency on many cases and never knew it. Ellis has mentally dubbed her as \\"tango dancer\\". <br />Ellis pushes his fantasies of Isabel out of his mind and tries to maintain a professional relationship with her.

I own every single hard back that Jayne Ann Krentz has ever released and in large print when able. Her title \\"FAMILY MAN\\" is my all time favorite book of the genre. Yet for the first time ever, I am sorely disappointed. The author has kept the psychic subplot running that I, and many of her fans, love so much. However, the relationship between the hero and heroine has slowly changed over time. It no longer showsa strong heroine wanting to stand on her own two feet, but first must either (1) get the hero to take up his family duty so she no longer has to or (2) ask the hero for some temporary help. No matter which of the two are used, the hero already has his eye on her (or at least admires/desires her) and plans to do as she asks but keep her close by his side. Now an outside influence is pushing the main characters together. <br />In addition, the lucid dream theory seems too weak for this type of story. The whole thing came across to me as fake. On the other hand, the plot is pretty sound, I could tell the author did her research on the subject matter, and the entire book is extremely well written. If you are a die hard fan of this author, by all means purchase the hard back. (I did.)

She lost her husband, Fred, to cancer one year ago. Her elderly, eccentric friend, Mame Emerson, had her take some classes at \\"Mame's School of Alternative Life Lessons\\", such as Yoga. Now the pair decide to embark upon an epic road trip along historic Route 66. They are going to relive Mame's honeymoon trip. <br />Mame suffers a mild heart attack that throws a wrench into the plans. Hating hospitals, and knowing her nephew Elliott Roth \\"Doc Nice\\" (a famous radio doctor) would keep her from going, Mame tries to get out of the hospital before he shows up. She fails. But while Alys and her nephew are not looking, Mame sneaks out of the hospital, steals Elliott's black Range Rover, and off she goes! Of course, Mame gets someone else to drive since Alys is unavailable. Wiley Mame decides to do a bit of matchmaking while she avoids Elliott. At the same time she is helping one of her students kidnap a niece. <br />Dr. Elliot Roth wants Mame off the road and resting in a hospital or nursing home. Since Alys has Mame's pink Cadillac \\"Beulah\\" and the travel route, he has to accept the fact that he must travel with her if he is to have any chance of catching up with Mame. Alys is finally feeling alive again and is determined to enjoy the journey. Elliot is patient despite his pragmatic tendencies and pops Tums often. Spending hours together in old Beulah makes sparks fly, just as Mame expected to happen. <br />***** A fun romantic comedy that will make you feel as though you are traveling the historic Route 66 with Alys and Elliott. The back of the book has Elliott's last name listed as Ross; however, the inside of the book showed the last name Roth. So do not let the cover and my synopsis confuse you. It is just a tiny oversight and in no way detracts from the story.

Tony and Sue find themselves in a world of high stakes card games, kidnapping, larceny ... and shapeshifters of all kinds. <br />**** This super natural romance is told from Tony's point-of-view. The back ground of the shapeshifters does not go into deep detail. Readers learn only what Tony does as the story progresses.

When our story begins, fifteen-year-old Faye Smallwood lives in Sallysweet River on the planet of Demoth. She is human, the daughter of a doctor. A species called the Ooloms (think flying squirrels whose skin changes color like a chamaeleon) peacefully coexist with the humans. A new and deadly plague is wiping out millions of the Ooloms. Humans are somehow immune. Faye's father, Dr. Henry Smallwood finds the cure. The last Oolom to die is Proctor Zillif, a member of the Vigil, who Faye has become close to. Her father dies in a mining accident shortly thereafter. <br /> <br />Once an adult, Faye joins the Vigil, a band of fiercely independent monitors charged with rooting out government corruption. To help in this struggle, her mind is linked to the powerful datasphere that regulates the planet, X (pronounced Chay). While on her first assignment a couple of robots try to assassinate her. It is one of multiple attacks on proctors around the globe. <br /> <br />Ooloms and humans were not the first species to inhabit Demoth. The planet is riddled with long-abandoned mines and settlements. Somewhere deep among them is something that had been left behind: an alien technology of unimaginable potential to build or destroy. Enemy agents want desperately to find it. Even some of Faye's own people would kill to find it and unravel its mysteries. Proctor Faye Smallwood teams up with Admiral Festina Ramos (from the books \\"Expendable\\" and \\"Radiant\\") to discover who or what is behind a sinister conspiracy. During it all, new plagues are forming.  <br /> <br />***** Author James Alan Gardner won me as a fan from the book \\"Expendable\\". From then on, I have been scrambling to get my hands on each of his previously published novels. I worried that none of his other books would equal the wonder I felt upon reading the first. Fortunately, the author has yet to let me down. As it stands, this is the third book by the author I have finished reading and I could not choose upon which I have enjoyed best. Therefore, I will plainly state that if you come across a book written by James Alan Gardner, do not bother reading the back to learn what it is about. Simply purchase the book. It is more than worth the money! *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-12-09

Every person, every animal, every insect, every leaf that had been falling from a tree simply froze. The birds hung in mid air as if by string. No tree moved. No wind blew. The world and everything in it simply STOPPED.  <br /> <br />However, there were a few beings that still moved. Some special children seemed to be immune to the stopping of time. Max Quick, Casey Cole, and Ian Keating were such. They seemed to have some super abilities too, thanks to \\"the Pocket\\" of time stop. But there were aliens too. And the alien queen was searching for a pendant, an ancient artifact.  <br /> <br />Max and his friends must recover the pendant first. Yet the closer they get to it the more dangerous things become. <br /> <br />***** Even adults will be fascinated by the theories in this tale.

In fact, Syd is en route home to pack when Lilly, her best friend since second grade, calls her on the cell phone.  <br /> <br />Lilly is an investigative reporter and needs to meet with Syd as soon as possible. Syd pulls up at the meeting spot just in time to see some guys in a van kidnap Lilly. Forget the vacation! Syd is determined to locate Lilly. Was the kidnapping related to the investigation Lilly is doing on the car wreck of a senator's daughter? Was it related to the ex-husband who is out for custody of their six-year-old girl? Was it simply for ransom?  <br /> <br />Former special forces (DELTA) captain Jake Sloan has finally put the past behind him. Then the FBI approaches him to help bring down Victor van Heusen, Jake's former commander, who is believed to be supplying weapons to terrorists. To do this, Jake must return to Philadelphia and reside in an apartment across the hall from Syd's. (Doug Avery is an employee of van Heusen.) Jake must gain Syd's trust in order to find out if she knows anything about van Heusen, even indirectly. Now bullets are flying and time is running out.  <br /> <br />***** This is the main plot but there is more going on than I state in the synopsis.

William \\"Billy\\" Longbow was just a boy in Lufkin, Texas, when he first saw the bloody terror that a giant Russian Razorback hog could inflict. Billy and his older brother, JJ, watched helplessly as it gutted their friend and then they sobbed as several hogs devoured the body. Later, as a young man, Billy was drafted and sent to Vietnam. He ended up a side gunner on a Huey 67H20 helicopter. While there, he saw the bloody terror that man could inflict as well. <br /> <br />A medically discharged Billy returned home to heal, mentally and physically. Soon JJ was swearing that he saw the same huge hog that had killed their friend long ago. Worse, the giant hog had several others with him. The huge Razorback hog became a menace to the entire community. Even with a six thousand dollar reward on the razorback's head, no one could find it, much less kill it. So Billy must finally make the decision to take matters into his own hands. <br /> <br />**** The military section of the book is a very small part. Ninety percent of this thriller focuses on the razorback and its reign of terror. The author uses his outdoorsman experience to make this tale extremely realistic. A bit of romance is thrown in with the arrival of Suzanne for Billy. She has a level head, just like Billy, and she is one feisty lady. All-in-all, the author, Scott Wilde, has written a wonderful hunting thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. **** <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-12-03

There is an old Innuit (Eskimo) legend about a huge monster with sharp, rending claws called a Tuurngaq. Professor Raine Devereux says he has dug one up, frozen in cryogenic life suspension, during an archaeological dig. Raine says the creature defrosted and is currently loose on the North Slopes, killing all it finds. Therefore, he is trying to stop the preliminary work on a proposed Trans-Canada pipeline.<br /><br />Having been harmed by the Tuurngaq, Raine is being kept in the medical section of the pump station. The engineer of the station, Jaarl Larsson, plans to do all he can to prove to Raine, and his own work crew, that the Tuurngaq is not real. Jaarl is convinced it is nothing more than a bear doing all the recent attacks and killings. He learns that Raine has a daughter who happens to work at the Valdez Terminal of the Alaska Pipeline. He hopes to convince her to visit the pump station. Perhaps she can help convince her father to stop spreading rumors of a legend walking around and to stop his campaign against the pipeline.<br /><br />Francine Devereux has not seen her father in over twenty years. She had thought he was dead. She agrees to speak with her father, not only for Jaarl's reasons, but to also find out why he left his wife and daughter all those years ago. Yet before she even reaches the secluded pump station, someone tries to kill her. Once at the station, the attempts on her life continues. Worse, it seems the Tuurngaq is real. At the pump station, Francine will learn to love and to fear!<br /><br />*** A very good mystery with a touch of romance and danger to keep the pace moving along at a good clip. The character of the hero, Jaarl, is very well developed and very realistic. However, the character of the heroine, Francine, is not as well done. She starts out smart, but becomes too naive to be realistic to me, as the reader. Yet through it all, this novel held my attention until the very end. Great reading for those who love mysteries, the wilderness of Alaska, or just want a \\"romantic thriller\\"! ***<br /><br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-11-30

He intends to keep her, no matter how hard she resists or how often she claims that she is not the one for him.  <br /> <br />**** The secret society is the most enticing part of this novel. But personally, I adore super natural and/or fantasy with my romance and was disappointed in how little the shape shifting was used. Overall, the novel came across as a light reading type of romance with just a bit of shape shifting thrown in.

She has just wrapped up one big case and two others pending, but her boss puts an end to those plans. Her other cases are being delegated elsewhere. Why? Cullen Pulaski is her godfather, her friend, and one of the richest and well known men in America. He is a big player in the American Business Consortium. The accord (consortium) was formed in the wake of 9/11. It is an attempt at communication and cooperation among leading industrial bigwigs internationally. Negotiations with the Chinese are almost complete. However, Cullen believes that someone is killing off the key players of the accord. Cullen went to the White House and got approval to make a task force to investigate his hypothesis. He chose Madison Harper to share command with Gabriel \\"Gabe\\" Roarke (CIA) in gathering the people to make up the task force and head it.  <br /> <br />Gabe did not like being pulling out of his undercover mission after three years of work on it. Yet when Cullen wants something he normally gets it. And this time, he got it. Gabe also did not like the fact that he had to share command with a \\"profiler\\", and a woman at that. Without Madison's permission, he calls in a couple men to be in the force. Too bad if she did not like it. But he never expected to meet Madison and find out that she not only feels the same way about him, but she had also recruited a couple of people without his permission. Too bad if HE did not like it.  <br /> <br />The two obviously get off to a bad start. Sparks fly for more than one reason. However, people are dying and the accord is in jeopardy. They must work together to figure out it out quickly, because the killer is hitting closer to home.  <br /> <br />***** This is the first of a trilogy.

Fox was the best scout in the area until a gunshot to her leg ended the career. She lives a quiet life now with her best friend, an elderly black man called Peaches. As much as Peaches has tried to help her, Fox could not get past her thirst for revenge against Hobb Jennings who ruined her life when she was a child. Jennings still lives high on the hog in Denver, where he runs Jennings Mining & Mercantile. A chance for Fox to kill Jennings arrives in the form of a handsome man looking to hire her as a guide through the wilderness to Denver.  <br /> <br />Matthew Tanner needs to reach Denver within three months. His father, Hobb Jennings, is being held by kidnappers and he must get the ransom there in time. Two other men are in their party, Hanratty and Brown, as they begin heading west carrying gold ... gold that everyone in the world seems to already know about. Fox agrees, but Tanner must also agree to hire Peaches as their wrangler.  <br /> <br />The trek is long and hard. There is danger at every turn. Tanner has no idea, at first, that Fox plans to kill his father. But even when he does learn it he cannot change the way he feels for Fox, nor does he wish to. However, he cannot believe his father has done what she claims.  <br /> <br />***** The author hides Fox's real name until far into the book. Therefore, I will not reveal it. Rest assured the nickname is worthy. I especially love the fact that the author, Maggie Osborne, did not make her characters to be physically perfect, such as Fox missing an earlobe. This made Fox seem more real to me.  <br /> <br />The story is extremely well written and there is something going on every minute. Boredom will NOT be a problem while you read this gem! If I did not know better I would swear Maggie Osborne somehow shocked life into the characters, even the secondary ones.

But Magister Andru realized that the young boy showed potential to surpass even the talents of magisters! Erek could become one of the rare master adepts!

The family secret is so secret that no one in Jessie's known family even knows it exists! (You will have to read the book to understand how that can possibly be true.)  <br /> <br />Captain Marcus Viator of the Alliance research starship \\"Freedom\\", is upset when he learns Jessie is beamed onto the ship by mistake. Jessie looks very much like his lieutenant, Veronese Qilana, who disappears about the same time Jessie appears. Scanners swear that Jessie IS Veronese, but that is impossible. Or is it? Before he can send Jessie back to Earth a Praetorium ship arrives. (They are renegades who prey on peaceful ships and \\"Freedom\\" is research, not military any more.) The captain is forced to flee with Jessie still aboard and one of his crew members missing.  <br /> <br />Jessie wants only to return home. Until this is possible she is determined to keep busy. When her skilled mechanic ears hear an engineering problem, she meets Chief Engineer Luqett (who sounds much like \\"Scotty\\" from the original \\"Star Trek\\" show). Thus Jessie becomes a temporary crew member. Shortly thereafter, mechanical problems turn out to be sabotage and the Praetorium are not finished with them yet.  <br /> <br />***** Science Fiction and Romance blend together flawlessly in this novel. Some of the crew watch too much Terran TV, such as Luqett sounding like Scotty. There is also a sub-plot on Earth concerning Jessie's brother, Tim.

Since that cruise, no one would book passage due to Daisy's ghost. The ship was put into dry dock ... for eighty years.  <br /> <br />Sexton St. Croix was putting the ship back out to sea.

Chapters include: <br />An Ignored Truth <br />Vengeance Is His <br />The Right Way To Respond <br />The Issue Of Authority <br />The Role Of Suffering <br />Blessed Are The Mistreated <br />Rising Above Mistreatment <br />Will He Find Faith? <br />About The Author <br /> <br />*** The whole concept of this book is for the mistreated person to turn the other cheek and do nothing in revenge ... no matter what. After all, God will \\"defend and vindicate you\\". Personally, I agreed with much of the book. However, I disagreed with quite a bit. For example, if someone spread untrue rumors and got me in trouble at work, I simply could not, would not, do nothing and let myself take the blame. I would fight for my rights and my job. After all \\"God helps those who help themselves\\" too.  <br /> <br />Each person who reads this small book will have to look within themselves to decide what is right. The book reads much like a seminar. The author gives clear examples. The book is paperback size so it fits well in your hands, but the cover is actually hard back. There are only 93 pages, not including the few end pages that are trying to sell you items, and yet the book is over $12.00 in price. So be aware of how expensive this little book is before you run out to a book store to purchase it. ***  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-11-15

In fact, he is the best money can buy. He can charm a jury at the same time he slashes the prosecution. He is living high until he is sentenced to do forty hours of community service due to reckless driving.<br /><br />The judge asks Sandy DeMarco to take charge of Ethan. Sandy comes from a family of cops. Her brothers have told her several stories about Ethan, but Sandy still tells the judge she'll do it. (Sandy believes in looking for the good in people.) Forewarned is forearmed, so she plans to keep the charmer at arms length. Sandy runs a florist shop during the day. At night she is the neighborhood crime watch. The first night they are together on a routine watch patrol ends up with a brutal murder and Sandy's employee, Josh, is the prime suspect. With Josh's background, Sandy knows that he could be put to death for a crime he did not commit unless Josh gets the best lawyer in the area.<br /><br />Ethan, drawn by his attraction to Sandy, agrees to help. They soon learn that the victim had a secret life. As they continue to investigate, the killer sets his sights on Sandy. Ethan could end up getting himself killed to protect Sandy.<br /><br />**** Sandy's character is a bit too naive for me to find believable, but otherwise she is a pillar of strength. The plot is sound and the story feels smooth as silk. Author Jane Graves did a wonderful job in showing Ethan's dawning guilt at the beginning of the book, as well as, the slow changes in his character there after. It is always a delight for me to see talent in an author and in this story Jane Graves proves that she has major writing talent! Wonderful romantic suspense novel. ****<br /><br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-11-09

One week before Audrey Schultz's mother died the pair had a brief argument that ended with Audrey wishing her mother was dead. Now that it has happened, Audrey feels heavy guilt and grief. Her father, aunt, and uncle are also sad and are trying to make life without mom seem as normal as possible, but the guilt weighs heavy on Audrey's young shoulders.  <br /> <br />Audrey lives in Bellevue, Nebraska. That is near Omaha. Since her mom died, Audrey has been walking along the railroad tracks to be alone. She knows it is wrong. Mom's rule was never to go there. Yet that was the place that made Audrey feel just a little better. Then one day out there she meets Shadows. He is a silvery-coated collie with eerie blue eyes, a blue merle collie. They become friends.  <br /> <br />Shadows never lets Audrey touch him, he never comes around unless Audrey is alone, and he always gets scared and runs off whenever a train comes along the tracks. Audrey is certain the dog is real, but who does he belong to? No one seems to know. Then her uncle tells her about a collie just like Shadows who was killed by a train years before. Audrey begins to search for information on the dog that had been killed; however, not all the answers are logical ones.  <br /> <br />**** This is a great chapter book for kids ages 8-12. Each chapter begins with a lovely illustration, enriched with tiny details. The only down side to the story, in my opinion, is that it ends too abruptly. I felt as though the last few pages were missing, but that was not the case. ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-11-09

Melon Elementary School and join the third-graders in the classroom at the end of the hall. Some very odd things happen in that special classroom. Mr. Leeks, the custodian, tells everyone who will listen that he hears noises coming from inside that room, even late at night. Once, Mr. Leeks was outside cleaning and looked through the classroom window only to see someone sitting at the teacher's desk! Mr. Leeks promises that he saw the ghost of W.T. Melon sitting there, plain as day, teaching an invisible class. Of course, that is impossible since Mr. Melon died over twenty years ago.  <br /> <br />While you read about the third-graders in the classroom at the end of the hall, you will watch nine kids have some amazing things happen to them. For example, Roger is the class Pain-in-the-Neck. But after a visit from a dust genie that changes. Then there is Emily who is a very tidy girl, except for her desk. When a desk pest makes her desk his home, she changes her ways. Let us not forget Kenneth either. He finds reading to be difficult. But a magical book that tells the future makes reading a joy.  <br /> <br />***** Nine tales grace this book's pages. Each story is accompanied by wondrous illustrations that will bring any young child's imagination to life. This is perfect as a first chapter book for pre-schoolers, if parents have been helping their child to read early. Most kids will be able to read it by first or second grade. Parents would do well to purchase this book and read one story (one chapter) to their children before putting them to bed. It not only makes for wonderful bed time tales, but also help the kids get an early start on reading. The stories are so delightful that children may ask for a story from this book, instead the normal ones. Very well done! Highly recommended! *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-11-08

In a moment of madness, Ayanna says that she is already seeing someone. However, Ayanna did not expect Tanner to come up to the table and pretend to be the one she is dating.  <br /> <br />**** Four great stories by four of today's hottest African-American romance authors.

Elizabeth Mainwarring was en route to New Zealand, where she has a sheep station and land full of oil. However, before she finally settles down in New Zealand, Elizabeth stops in Calcutta to visit her estranged father, Colonel Andrew Mainwarring, in hopes of mending the breach. The area is already in disarray due to several recent murders.  <br /> <br />Major Nigel Covington-Singh is the youngest of the Maharaja of Kashmir's three sons. Even though he is a prince and an officer, the British officers and wives consider him beneath them in station. Nigel is a \\"wog\\", half English and half Indian. That does not mean that those snobbish wives do not try to seduce Nigel though. The man is very handsome. Nigel is part of the team investigating the \\"Bengal Killer\\". The killer has killed many Indian women already. Recently the killer began targeting the British women, but only those who have been with men outside their own race.  <br /> <br />Elizabeth and Nigel cannot help the attraction they feel for each other. Elizabeth is too modern to care what others will think of her for dating Nigel, but feels as though she is not worthy of an Indian Prince. Interestingly enough, Nigel feels that she is his superior. The biggest problem they face, though, is the killer. And the killer now has Elizabeth penned as his next target.  <br /> <br />***** This mystery-thriller has the taste of a Regency romance with the dangerous flavor of India's jungles mixed in. The only thing missing was the glorious ball rooms of London. But the majestic ball rooms of Bengal are just as breathtaking! The author set a murder mystery AND thriller plot during a volatile time in Bengal history. At this time, Bengal was still going for Home Rule (self government). The author added in several secondary characters that I could not help but care for. Fiona, Elizabeth's friend and companion, is but one example. I never found myself growing bored either. The mystery is ongoing, the thrills are non-stop, and there are lots of scandalous opportunities presenting themselves for my entertainment. Very well done! *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-10-25

However, by the half way point of the novel Farah had morphed into one of my pet peeves, a wimpy heroine. Farah suddenly does not believe in her self worth, feels as though she could not hold a decent job without Lenox, and even whimpers like a beaten dog when Lenox hit her (cutting her cheek open). Hello? If a man OR woman hits the other even once, it is a red flag! I lost all admiration for my heroine. I read on hoping it would get better. <br />As for Lenox, he came across as little better than a pimp. He treated all his women like dirt. He claimed to love Farah, yet treated her even worse. He never beat the others. Farah came across as much classier than the others. Yet a woman such as she would not take all the verbal, mental, and physical abuse. Nor would she have used [the tape in such] petty vengeance. As I finished reading the last page and closed the book, I had no feeling of happiness or satisfaction. I felt let down. Perhaps I am simply used to &quot;happily ever afters&quot; when I escape into a good book. This ending left me cold, with no real closure. <br />I adored Maryann Reid's previous novel, but I cannot enjoy or recommend this one. I am still a fan of the author's, do not get me wrong.

(Shown while Julia was a secondary character in the first two books titled \\"Suddenly Sexy\\" and \\"Sinfully Sexy\\".) Yet she still has far to go. To that end, she decides to create a new TV hit, a reality show, where she is going to turn rugged West Texas men into sensitive guys. <br />Undercover cop Ben Prescott is shot in the thigh. Not wanting to keep his brother, Sterling, and his new wife from taking their honeymoon trip, Ben promises to remain in Julia's huge house as he recovers. Julia wants HIM to be her first make-over candidate. Of course he refuses. No one, including Julia, knows he is a cop and the last thing an undercover cop needs is to be plastered all over the TV or in newspapers ... especially while (once he is physically able) he is searching for his partner's killer. <br />***** I cannot express how disappointed I am that this trilogy is closing. This book, in my opinion, is the best of the three. It had me on the edge of my seat in some areas, diving into totally HOT scenes in others, and laughing aloud in still others! However, I console myself by repeating over and over \\"She will write another book. She will write another book. She will write another book.\\" Author Linda Francis Lee creates realistic characters, each with their own set of personalities, and does it all in such a way that I come to actually care for the characters.

Arthur was taught all he needed for his future position as King. Nimue resided in the magical realm called Avalon and guarded the Sword Excalibur. The two powerful beings trusted and relied on each other. But Nimue came to fear that Merlin would forget the Old Ways. More and more people were turning to a different religion. Merlin felt that Nimue kept her mind closed to changes and compromises. Thus it was easy for Morganna to subtly turn them against one another. Each believed that the other had betrayed them. It resulted in a Wizards' Duel. Neither Merlin, nor Nimue, won. They were evenly matched. Nimue cursed Merlin's descendants to suffer at the hands of their greed and lust for power. Merlin cursed Nimue's descendants to search for love and never find fulfillment. When the heavens fall into the same alinement again, the two will return to continue the battle for Avalon. <br />Present Day: <br />Tamara Camden was a reporter who did not believe in witches and magic. Her mother, Diana, is known far and wide as the local witch though. Diana never tried to push her own beliefs on Tamara ... until the day Tamara found Nimue's journal in the attic. Only then did Diana tell Tamara about the legend and the family curse. And the heavens would be in the correct alinement again within the next month, during \\"The Ceremony of the Stars\\". Tamara believes none of it, of course. When her boss calls her shortly afterward, he tells her that she is to travel to Glastonbury, England, to do a story on the upcoming \\"Ceremony of the Stars\\" Tamara believes it to be coincidence.

Sabine Rose's psychic gift got her kicked out of her last school and sent to live with her grandmother, Nona, who also has the \\"family gift\\". So Sabine hides her abilities in her new school, pretending to be normal. She is on the school newspaper staff and helps Manny with his Mystic Manny column. Her best friend is a cheerleader and Sabine often helps the entire squad with their practices and banners. She has a fabulous new boyfriend, Josh, that she met while saving his life (and he will never find out how she knew he was in danger if she has anything to say about it.) It sounds as though Sabine has everything a normal teenager could ever wish for.  <br /> <br />However, Sabine still sees ghosts, spirit guides, and visions. Josh's best friend is jealous of her. Dominic is Nona's newest house guest with his own special talent. Someone vandalized the school and some things have been stolen as well.  <br /> <br />Manny has always wished he had some sort of psychic talent. Even though he does not, he is still very good natured and keeps an open mind. He knows Sabine is more than normal and confronts her with it. Once she opens up to him, Manny introduces her to Thorn. Thorn likes the Goth look. It keeps people from getting too close to her. Thorn has her own special \\"gift\\". Manny, Thorn, Dominic, and Sabine, team up to investigate the vandalism and theft. But someone knows Sabine is out to locate the vandalizer and begins to frame her for it all. In addition, Sabine keeps having visions of a teen girl with a dragonfly tattoo on her wrist being surrounding by danger and death. Somehow Sabine must prove her innocense and warn the mystery girl with the tattoo without revealing her psychic gift to everyone.  <br /> <br />***** W-O-W-! You will not want to put this awesome book down! Sabine, Thorn, Dominic, and Manny make a wonderful investigation team. Just think of all the things this group could do if they stay together.

By the age of eight she'd killed her first person. While her father, Iron Mike, was off fighting the invading Posleen she had been raised by her grandfather, practically on the front-lines of a war that had erased five billion humans from the face of the earth.  <br /> <br />By the end of the war she had been listed as dead. In truth, she'd been recruited into the elite ranks of the Bane Sidhe, a group of underground warriors dedicated to breaking the strangle-hold of the elf-like Darhel. For forty years Cally has gone on mission after mission. She completely changed her appearance and personality more often than others changed their socks ... and seemingly much easier.  <br /> <br />Now, in the year 2047, Cally goes to Titan Base, hunting a mole. The team take out the real Captain Sinda Makepeace and inserts Cally. But she never expects to fall in love with one of the enemy.  <br /> <br />***** Cally is one of the best assassins I have read in Sci-Fi thus far. She reminded me at times, especially while being tortured, of Robert A. Heinlein's main character in the book titled \\"Friday\\". She does whatever it takes to get the job done. Killing comes as naturally to Cally as breathing. Authors John Ringo and Julie Cochrane did an excellent job in teaming up to create a story for the little girl I recall from previous books.

He ignored the world that existed outside the barriers, the place known as the Waste.  <br /> <br />But Destiny requires Matthias's skill once again. Hyrn knows that Matthias would refuse help if simply asked. Thus the Sword Master of Stone's Rest has Matthias kidnapped so he could be shown the slaughter that the Bodiless and Edward Tobit has done ... and will continue doing. Once seen, Matthias could not bring himself to refuse helping the Brotherhood in their quest to strike a balance between the Bodiless and the human denizens of the Wastes and Outer Lands.  <br /> <br />Nefta is demonkind. Owing Matthias a life debt, she helps him when all hope seems lost. In doing so, she makes a strong enemy, Seth. She wants to learn from Matthias to make her Realm a piece of art.

There is no war, little crime, and life is sacred ... unless you are an Explorer. Humans' morale takes a sharp nose dive if someone beautiful and loved dies. Therefore, the Human race takes those among themselves who are considered to be the misfits, the deformed, the ugly, the flawed, and trains them to be ECMs (Expendable Crew Members).  <br /> <br />Festina Ramos has a red birthmark that covers one side of her face. She belongs to the well-trained, always-dwindling ranks of the ECMs. Her partner is Yarrun Derigha. They are ordered by the High Council to escort the mentally unstable Admiral Chee to Melaquin. All information about Melaquin is classified. The only thing publically known is that it seems to be a duplicate planet of Old Earth. Everyone who has ever went to Melaquin has disappeared. No one seems to know why. But once or twice a year, a small party of ECMs is sent to investigate.  <br /> <br />Of course, this is meant to be the LAST mission for Festina and Yarrun. But Festina has other ideas.  <br /> <br />***** Excellent! James Alan Gardner brought all the characters to life, especially Festina! This is one of the best sci-fi books I have read this year. This novel came out in 1997. It was the author's debut novel. However, it is so hard for me to believe this was his first!  <br /> <br />This story was written to stand alone. A second novel of this type was not even considered by the author (per his short interview with SFBC). Indeed, James Alan Gardner went on to write other books. But so many readers cried out to him and his publisher for more about the ECMs that the author finally broke down. Therefore, this year (2004) a second ECM novel came out titled \\"Radiant\\" (Review forthcoming.)

When civil war broke out, Cadet Scott St. Andrew and Cadet Halitov abandoned the Terran Alliance to join the rebellion of the Seventeen Worlds. This marked them as traitors. However Scott is beginning to believe neither deserve his loyalty. Due to his not being fully conditioned, Scott is still aging rapidly. This means that even though he is a lethal fighting machine, he will not live much longer. <br /> <br />The Colonial Wardens is a secret splinter group within the rebel infrastructure. They are planning a coup and have agreed to correct his deteriorating condition IF he casts his lot with them. They also all but told Scott flat out that his brother, Jarrett, was really alive. Scott is determined to find out if all the Wardens say is true or if they are feeding him more lies. <br /> <br />**** The character, Paul, from the first book shows up again. Readers get an update on him, his lover Dina, and his father the Colonel. Halitov remains his normal selfish person, but I still could not help liking him. Of course, like the first book, Scott gets promoted quickly due to the war. Also like the first book, this one ends with no closure.

He and Halitov (his number one partner) have been genetically enhanced by a strange alien technology that has given them great abilities, but is slowly killing them.  <br /> <br />St. Andrew is one of the few to escape an Alliance surprise attack on the colonists' capital world. Fleeing the bloodbath, he returns to the harsh moon of Exeter where the entire mess began. There, he hopes salvation awaits. However, as in every war, there are traitors. The acts of one traitor will leave St. Andrew with no place to run, no one to trust, and with an inevitable choice: to save the woman he loves...or the worlds he is sworn to protect.  <br /> <br />***** This is the last book in this spectacular trilogy. All strings are wrapped up, though not always neatly. Throughout the entire trilogy, author Ben Weaver has shown how war can take people on the brink of adulthood and twist them, inside and out, every possible way. As the reader, I could easily sympathize with the main character, Scott, as he made difficult choices and then had to live with the outcome.

Colonist Scott St. Andrew knows that the only route off his poisonous rock of a home planet is the elite South Point Military Academy on the moon called Exeter. He must complete the military's most grueling training program in order to become an officer in the Guard Corps of the Terran Alliance. But like all born on his miner planet, he has a genetic defect that shows plainly in the form of a birthmark on his face. This mark makes him the target of ridicule and ritual hazing by his classmates. <br /> <br />Long standing colonial resentments against the Alliance erupt into violent open rebellion. Cadet St. Andrew is forced to choose a side to die for. He is sent into deep-space combat long before his training is complete.

But something happens during his \\"conditioning\\" and side effects happen. <br /> <br />**** Here is a word of warning for everyone...this book has no closure. Make sure you have all three books in this trilogy BEFORE you begin reading it! I wish someone had warned me before I began it. As for the story, plots, and characters, they are very well done.

Edward, the Earl of Warwick, awakened to shouting in his home. Upon locating the source he met Maggie. She claimed to be the widow of the Earl of Warwick, just arrived from America. Edward gently informed Maggie that her late husband, Lawrence Henshaw, had never been a titled gentleman. In fact, Lawrence left England just in time to avoid the hangman's noose. Lawrence had been a traitor to the Crown. Edward informed his superior, in the Foreign Office, about his unexpected visitors and was instructed to keep an eye on Maggie at all times. After all, Maggie could be a spy or Lawrence may have left her something of importance to England. <br /> <br />Maggie Peabody Henshaw had no idea that her countess title had been yet another lie by \\"The Scoundrel\\". This bit of news implied that she was now penniless, stuck in London, and responsible for the welfare of her sister and maid. She had no choice but to accept the Earl's help. Maggie needed to marry well, and quickly, if they were to survive. Edward persuaded Maggie to stay at Warwick Manor. Her story was to be that she had married the old Earl shortly before his death and was staying with the new Earl for awhile. During that time, she could search out a husband. She did not know that Edward was only helping her so he could keep an eye on her. <br /> <br />Both Maggie and Edward were attracted to one another. However, Edward was already pledged to Lady Fiona in Yorkshire and Maggie had several men vying for her hand in marriage.

There are more \\"hot\\" scenes in this book than actual story line; however, there IS a decent plot going on. The \\"hot\\" scenes are very explicit, many details.

The mysterious powers of the legendary Red King have been passed down through his descendants. No one has been born with all of the Red King's powers; however, one or two of the powers (A.K.A. \\"gifts\\" and \\"endowments\\") turn up unexpectedly in someone who has no idea where they came from. Some of the people who receive a gift use it for good, some for evil. When a child is found who shows signs of having a power, they are sent to attend the Bloor's Academy.  <br /> <br />Charlie Bone was a normal ten-year-old boy. His father has been dead most of his life, or so he and his mother thought. Living with them are both his grandmothers and Uncle Paton. Grandma Bone is snobby and loves to remind everyone that before she married Mr. Bone, she had been a Yewbeam. The Yewbeams were an ancient family, their history littered with artistic people who had more unusual talents. Charlie's family tolerates her only because the Bone family is so poor and Grandma Bone purchased everything for them, including the house. But Grandma Bone stayed close because Charlie's father had been one of those with powerful magic. Even though Charlie never showed signs of having a gift, it did not mean that one would not show up later. This is exactly what happened.  <br /> <br />One morning Charlie looked at a photograph and could hear the thoughts of the people in it! Charlie is horrified, but Grandma Bone and his terrible aunts are delighted. This meant Charlie had to attend the Bloor's Academy during the week and only spend the weekends and holidays at home! Once there, Charlie makes a few friends and learns that some of his classmates have equally mysterious powers.  <br /> <br />With his new talent, Charlie learns of a baby that had been adopted by mean people. The biological aunt had been searching for the baby girl for years. When Charlie and his friends find out that the girl is someone at the academy, the search is on! But the girl has no idea of her past, so the small team must figure outwhich student it is, how to bring back her memory, and help her escape her cruel guardians who want to use her powers for evil.  <br /> <br />***** Think of this book as a type of Harry Potter for the younger kids. The book is broken down into titled chapters, a chapter book. The students do not learn spells and magic. They learn the same thing normal school kids are taught, but also how to hone their special talent(s). As in real life, good verses evil. Charlie and his friends have to decide what the right thing to do is, and then how to go about doing it, without the bad guys finding out and stopping them.  <br /> <br />This seems to be the first of a series. The author, Jenny Nimmo, has written this book so that the story can stand alone, however, the reader is left with a few questions that may be addressed in future adventures with Charlie and his friends. I found this tale to be well written, with very good morals, and extremely entertaining. Highly recommended reading! *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-08-27

Dr. Madge Hall (NSA scientist) and Major Drake Barber (Air Force scientist) has the machine relocated for further study. They soon become considered the experts on the device. Political and military branches are in a power struggle for possession it, but they all agree that Madge and Drake should work together and unravel its mysteries. Madge and Drake realize that should the device fall into the wrong hands anything could happen. Therefore, not trusting their own superiors they report only enough to keep the bosses happy while they study the machine. The machine can not only go forward and backward in our time, but it can also do so on any planet in any solar system and galaxy!  <br /> <br />When delay is no longer an option, everyone is present for the first real test. Drake is chosen to travel back in time to the year 1880, America. The trip is only a few hours for Drake. But over a year has passed when he returns. Nothing he did changed the present, however, Drake returns to find himself Brazil instead of the lab. Madge, fearing the superiors, had slightly altered the return plans so the higher-ups would believe the time device, and Drake, were lost forever. Now Madge and Drake will take full responsibility for keeping the time travel machine safe from the world, which is not ready for it. However, Madge must make one trip back in time to 1901, England. Otherwise, she may never exist! To make matters worse, the people from the future know that the machine failed to return (of course) and aliens are looking for the time travel machine. And they are not exactly human!  <br /> <br />*** This novel seems to target adult sci-fi fans; however, teens and young adults would enjoy it much more. It is not a long book, about 157 pages. There are no chapter numbers. Instead, each new section has a brief title, such as \\"Genworld\\" and \\"The Trial\\". It is a stand alone story, but has the potential of becoming a small series if the author so chooses. One word of advice to readers: Do not read the back of the book. It tells too much of the story and could spoil it for you. Simply open the book and begin reading.  <br /> <br />All-in-all, this is a very good book to curl up with in front of an open fire on a cold, rainy afternoon. No sub-plots to detract from the tale, just fun possibilities. This is author D.E. Gronquist's debut novel and it clearly shows that he has great potential in the sci-fi genre. ***  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews. <br />	2004-08-16

Her mother was her best friend, she was always on the honor role at any school she attended, she went to church every Sunday, and even sang in the choir. It was during her early college years with a roommate that Regina first sampled any type of drug. This is where and when this book begins, in 1977.  <br /> <br />\\"Kryptonite\\" is street slang for crack cocaine. Now do not go thinking that Regina jumped into drug use with crack. On the contrary, it was a gradual process that began with weed. Her excuse was simply to try it because it could not hurt and she wanted to be nice to her roommate. But the excuses changed often throughout her twenty year addiction. Regina liked the way drugs made her feel. It helped Regina concentrate on her studies or jobs. It helped her stay awake and live on three hours of sleep daily so she could work two full time jobs. It helped Regina cope during hard times. Everyone was doing it. She was not hurting anyone else...The list of excuses go on and on.  <br /> <br />**** The editing for the book is not well done. However, the mistakes are not so bad that they detract from Regina's story. And what a story it is! Regina holds back no punches of how bad her life became. Better yet, she blames no one else for her errors of judgement. She takes full responsibility for her actions. I wish that the book told more of what became of Eddie Hall and what happened to James (\\"the custodian\\") after he snapped. But the main focus is Regina and her drug life. Through her story, there is hope that others with their lives lost in drugs may read it and decide to change their lives for the better. Or perhaps, a friend or family member will read it to understand and perhaps help. After all, those HARD on drugs have no time or urge to read anything themselves.  <br /> <br />All-in-all, this book is a real eye-opener. It gives a real look at the cold, hard, and dark life that drug users go through. Highly recommended reading! ****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-08-09

Writing horror novels is a way to purge herself of past demons that still haunt her nightmares. Nightmares that are courtesy of her parents' idea of punishment, being locked up under cupboards for hours on end. She has a long-term lover, who is married, named Max. Max has left Cass in the U.K. and taken his wife off to America for about a year, leaving Cass all alone. Cass has always thought Max and she would eventually marry, have children, and grow old together. Now she realizes that it's never going to happen. Being in her mid-forties, it is probably too late for her to even get pregnant.  <br /> <br />Jason, her long time friend, has developed a crush on her, due to the Vampirella costume she wears while she does crypt-o-grams (singing telegrams). He has told Cass in no uncertain terms that he would GLADLY let her use him to get pregnant! At the same time, Dante Chase, the new owner of the U.K.'s most ghost-infested manor house, Kedge Hall, has caught her attention. Now, THERE is a man even more haunted by his past than SHE is!  <br /> <br />Every year the vicar has a slave auction that Cass volunteers for. The public bids on the volunteers, and once their indentured servant is purchased, the winner has a slave for one day to do chores for them. (Nothing kinky.) Max, Jason, and Dante are each determined to bid for her. And Cass somehow knows that they are all after more than a little light dusting or palm reading. Oh, did I forget to mention about Cass's little talent? If she touches someone she can feel their emotions, sort of an empathy talent.  <br /> <br />Through it all is her crazy family. Her father calls often and leaves long rants on her machine calling her the spawn of satan and preaching brimstone. Her mother won't speak with her. One of her brothers climbs rocks for fun. The other brother is always stoned, and is quite a character through this whole book, and her \\"sweet\\" sister, Jane, is anything but.<br /> <br />***** This book will have you chuckling out loud as you read. Never a dull moment in this novel. And I could not help but L-O-V-E Cass. She is a riot and so easy going. If the author of this little gem, Trisha Ashley, ever decides to give up Contemporary, she could go into horror! Cass is always daydreaming scenes for whatever horror novel she is currently writing. I found myself as fascinated with Cass's writing as I was with Cass herself! Author Trisha Ashley is an author to watch as she buds out with all her talents. Count me in as one of her new adoring fans. Highly recommended reading here! *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-08-09

Archer Lowell was the youngest. To make himself look tougher, he suggested a game. Each of them thought up three people that they would love to kill once they were out of jail. Then they swapped victims. Archer never meant for any of it to really happen. When Archer finally got out of prison, he decided to stay on the straight and narrow. So the other two prisoners went after those on their swapped hit list. One of them, Curtis, was dead. The other, Vince, would never get out of prison again. Archer was not a killer and had no intention of going after his three targets. However, Archer did not expect Vince to hire someone to watch him. When it became obvious that Archer would not play the game, Burt stepped in to make him.  <br />  <br /> FBI Special Agent Miranda Cahill was partnered with Agent William &quot;Will&quot; Fletcher to watch Archer, just in case he went on a killing spree. No one expected him to actually do it, not even the Bureau's profiler, Anne Marie. When the first person died under their noses, the hunt was on for a fleeing Archer. <br />  <br /> Also, Julianne, the daughter of Mara Douglas (from previous novel), had been located after seven long years. Mara's ex-husband, Jules, had hidden himself and his daughter with the Reverend Prescott. An agent had been inserted into the Reverend's Valley of the Angels and would soon escape, taking a reluctant young girl home to her mother. The agent first had to gather evidence that would shut down the child-prostitution rung that masqueraded as a shelter for run-away girls on the street. Everything was about to come to a climatic ending!  <br />  <br /> ***** Romance takes a back seat in this, the third of the &quot;Dead&quot; series. Since Miranda and Will already have a history together, the author did not have to build on the love portion. The two main characters already had strong feelings for one another. This gives much more time to the story's plots.Plots, plural.  <br />  <br /> Hold onto your seats, because Mariah Stewart will plunge you into a heart pounding, roller coaster ride.

If this book did not cost so much, I would probably have decided not to post a review at all. I have several reasons not to like this novel. I will try to address them all.  <br />  <br /> There are no typos that I saw. (There is a word missing on page 44 though.) The story is not well written. Everything is very choppy. I never came to care for any of the characters. In fact, I never felt as though I even knew Torn, the main character, at all. None of the characters have any depth to them. They are flat, lifeless, and boring.  <br />  <br /> There are two chapter fives (pages 53 and 63). Therefore, instead of fifteen chapters there is really sixteen. I read several breaks in the story that start with a single word, like a name, instead of a new chapter number. These sections make very little sense. Not only do they detract from the main story, but the narrator of these sections keeps repeating himself and then contradicting himself.  <br />  <br /> As much as I hate to say it, I simply cannot think of any target audience that would like this story. I am a big fan of sci-fi and fantasy novels; however, my opinion is to avoid this title. *  <br />	2004-08-02

There are twenty-three chapters and almost a dozen sci-fi authors! The entire novel takes place far away from our planet, Earth, at a place called &quot;Port Nowhere&quot;. There are dozens of different species that call Port Nowhere home. The inhabitants affectionately call it &quot;The Rock&quot;, because people live below ground. Few ever see the surface. Many believe the stars and tales of other places are just that, tales. As for planets with free water, that could not really exist! Water is never free!  <br />  <br /> LevOne is for the richest inhabitants. The lowest level (that house beings able to generously be labeled as civilized) is LevSev. There are lower levels, called the Depths. But trust me on this, you DO NOT want to go there!  <br />  <br /> Let me tell you about a few characters now. As the story opens, Port Nowhere is getting a new local commander. Captain Carle Eversyn arrives on the Rock. He commands the Consolidated Guard (A.K.A. the &quot;Connies&quot;) of Malpairiso Sector. He has the last word on everything! His main goal is to capture Malik &quot;Mal&quot; Blayne. Malik has single-handedly kept the Connies (and all the authorities that claimed authority before them) in chaos. Glimpses are often seen of Mal, but no one can find him. As with the best villains, Mal hides right under Captain Carle's nose. Mal is also Rudof Dyll, the richest person at Port Nowhere, but only his bodyguard knows it. Mal and Rudof look nothing alike. As for the bodyguard, he is one of the Vamir. Think Wookie, but meaner and deadlier.  <br />  <br /> Then there is Crila &quot;Cri&quot; Maragorn. Her left forearm is a prosthesis. She is a bartender at Dhamu's Place. But that left hand can become several weapons, power tools, and so much more! She joins the Circle of the Beryl. (Think assassins and spies that look like tall lizards.) Cri is half Human and half Halsan, so her form is human female, red hair, lilac skin color, and she is a lethal combination of lovely and deadly.  <br />  <br /> There is also a boy, Tau the Silent, who is just hitting puberty. I found him exceptional. Tarzan, if you recall, was raised by apes. Tau was raised by things much more deadly. I refuse to say what and I doubt that you would ever guess.  <br />  <br /> ***** There are several other characters, some get a lot of attention, some do not. The most awesome thing about this particular novel is that each chapter is written by a different author. So for the first few chapters, it is like reading an anthology. But each chapter picks up where the last left off! Soon the authors are using characters from each other. So Mal and Captain Carle have a plot going, then Mal could enter that plot and have another going that involves Tau, who may have another going with several others... You get the idea.  <br />  <br /> We have all heard the saying &quot;Too many cooks in the kitchen will spoil the dinner.&quot; Yet somehow, these authors have collaborated and the stories flow smoother than silk. You would have to really be looking to figure out where one author stops and another begins. Few authors can works well with other authors. This group is part of that elite clan. If you enjoyed the Starport Canteen scene during the original Star Wars movie, then you will LOVE this novel. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough! Astounding! *****  <br />  <br /> Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews. <br />	2004-07-23

As things get hot, the book shifts to &quot;Part Two&quot; with new characters to learn and more plots to view. They will eventually all mesh together for even bigger and more exciting battles.  <br />  <br /> All-in-all, this is an action packed fantasy, though long-winded at times, that will ignite your imagination as few others. **** <br />  <br /> Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews. <br />	2004-07-22

It contains four separate stories.  <br />  <br /> In ISADORA by Jeanne Allen, a young woman is accused of witchcraft and sentenced to burn all because she falls in love with a strange traveler. I cannot reveal where the traveler is from though. That is vital to the story. I would prefer you, as the reader, to find out on your own.  <br />  <br /> In TWIN STAR by Jeanine Berry, a young woman of the Dorshan race is a &quot;true dreamer&quot;. The ruler seeks a bride and orders several single women locked in his harem so he may sample them and choose. These two may change their entire world.  <br />  <br /> In EIDOLON by Shannah Biondine, a young lady (sort of) has a wager with her brother. I REFUSE to tell anything about her brother though. Part of the story's surprise is finding out. Anyhow, the brother maintains that humans are selfish, lazy, and greedy. She is to secure a pact with a mortal who must prove himself better than his peers. Both demonic and heavenly hosts await the outcome. <br />  <br /> In THIEF OF DREAMS by Sheri L. McGathy, the daughter of a lord is wooed by two men. One wants her for herself. The other wants her because the joining of their houses would be considered a great alliance. They have one year to win her heart. This story involves a Faery Ring. Telling anything more would ruin the tale. <br />  <br /> **** Fantastic stories from awesome authors that you will want to read over and over. I enjoyed every moment of the book. These stories do not target a certain audience. Great for male or female. Recommended! ****  <br />  <br /> Reviewed by Detra Fitch for Huntress Reviews. <br />	2004-07-22

There was an ancient evil formerly known as Elizabeth Wither, an evil that had existed in dozens of human hosts over the thousands of years of its existence. Wendy Ward destroyed Wither and thought the evil was defeated. She was wrong. As Wither died she cursed Wendy and now the young Wiccan must use her supernatural gifts to defeat it. <br />The curse calls upon a seven-foot-tall monster with razor-sharp teeth and a taste for human flesh. An enchantment camouflages the beast so it looks human. It views a magical line, like a rope, that leads straight to Wendy no matter where she roams. Once it kills Wendy it will be free. Its hunt begins. <br />Wendy is aided by Alex (her boyfriend), the Crone (Hannah's future self), ten-year-old Abby (who is a shapeshifter), and Kayla (who is still contaminated with Wither's black blood). Wendy must learn more magic and quickly. The creature is closing in and time is running out. <br />***** Books by John Passarella make it very difficult to sleep at night.

Fiona Monaghan, editor in chief of a high-fashion magazine, had vowed never to marry. She enjoyed the company of a few select men, but had determined that no man would ever have the opportunity to hurt her. When she was a child, her father had abandoned her and the pain of that experience reared its ugly head every time she allowed a man to become too close to her emotionally. <br />Fiona was not just beautiful; she was exotic. Although she certainly knew she was considered beautiful, she didn't seem to think too much about her looks. Her obvious weakness, and the one thing that seemed to consume her, was the clothing that filled her closets. Indeed, Fiona had often been known to say that no man would ever be worth giving up closet space for. As she wrapped herself in her high fashion job and lifestyle, her constant companion was a snoring English bulldog by the name of Sir Winston whom she loved completely. <br />Fiona lived her life in the style of her work, jetting to Europe for fashion shows and supervising model shoots on glamorous beaches, as if there was nothing else - and for her, there truly wasn't. She was at the peak of her career, totally self absorbed and enjoying every minute when John Anderson stepped into her life.<br />John is the head of a thriving ad agency, and is also a handsome widower with two daughters. Although John and Fiona are attracted to each other at first sight, it soon became clear (to Fiona at least) that they are total opposites. John doesn't seem to notice this small fact, though, and of course they do marry.<br />Throughout this story, we come to think of Fiona as oblivious to certain situations, inflexible and more than a little bit selfish - especially where John's living space and her clothes closets are concerned. On the other hand, we find that John is a headstrong widower who caters to the whims of his two almost-grown daughters, who are complete brats. Add to that mix Fiona's flamboyant houseman who runs around her apartment half-naked wearing her high heal shoes, and John's two brats and maniac housekeeper who sic the psycho dog from Hades on Fiona - not once but twice - and you have a story to hold your interest. It certainly held mine. <br />Divorce was inevitable, of course, because John finally realized that Fiona's lifestyle was vastly different from his - plus there were those two half-grown college-age brats (who wrapped him around their little fingers) to consider. So, less than a year after they married, John filed for divorce causing Fiona's worst fear to come true. Once again a man she loved abandoned her, and she was devastated. She quit her job, moved to Paris, and began to purge herself of her demons by writing a book that that closely resembled her life. That's where John found her again and thus the title of this book, Second Chance. <br />*****Because I could listen without interruption to Danielle Steel's latest book, Second Chance, on audio CD, I found lots of excuses to get into my car and run errands for everyone. I enjoyed it tremendously!*****	2004-07-13

Pilot Cyn Lystris leaves Free Trade because he is tired of making deliveries with the goods in one hand and his blaster in the other. Cyn could never work dirt-side though. He had been born in space and has vacuum bubbles in his blood. So he joined Overstars Mail. What could be more peaceful and less dangerous than carrying letters and parcels on a government-approved route? <br />Even after five years with no creature trying to eat him, Cyn still went way overboard when it came to the security of his ship, Piss Pot. Good thing. This trip Cyn picked up a load of trouble, literally. Cyn had six passengers and one large \\"beast in a cage\\". He does not like passengers, but it happens occasionally. Too late, Cyn learns that one of his passengers is the Imperial Challenger in disguise, followed by agents who want to capture or kill him. When someone threatened his Piss Pot Cyn falls back on his Free Trade tricks (and paranoias) to deal with it all. Not all of the problems are aboard the ship either. A variety of beings were determined to capture and enter Cyn's ship. <br />***** Who knew that delivering the mail could be so much fun? Roberta Gellis's writing style is much like those of Anne McCaffrey. So fans of McCaffrey's need to take a close look at this shining author, Gellis! Gellis has won awards for her writing in other genres, but Sci-Fi seems to be her niche.<br />This novel is witty, fast paced, and flies by the seat of Cyn's pants. You will be wondering what could possibly happen next. OUTSTANDING! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-07-12

Big problem is that Melody cannot even boil water or crack an egg without a disaster happening. But Melody knows how to play to an audience and becomes Salem's favorite magical cook on the new show \\"The Kitchen Witch\\"! <br />***** Add Tiffany, the station owner's spoiled daughter, into the mix for some spice.

Billionaire securities expert James Tremaine knew the term \\"corporate warfare\\" meant just that. So when he began receiving threatening letters, he ignored them. James had not gotten to where he was today without making enemies, especially in business rivals. Tremaine Technologies was on the verge of gaining a Pentagon contract. The letters were just someone trying to make him lose focus so he would not complete the encryption/decryption software in time. However, the letters captured his full attention when they began mentioning his parents. <br />\\"Your parents' deaths weren't accidents and yours won't be either.\\" <br />That car accident had happened twenty years ago when James had been eighteen. He had hired a P.I. named Rob Landry to check it all out. Landry's report said that it had been an accident, just as the police reports stated. But what if he had missed something? Time to visit Rob Landry. <br />Victoria \\"Tori\\" Corbett had grown up learning everything about the P.I. business from her father's knee. \\"Integrity Above All Else\\" had been his motto. He had lived by it and instilled it in his daughter. When James Tremaine came looking for old files of her father, she could not help him. All those old files had perished in a warehouse fire long, long ago. However, Tori convinced James to hire her. Who else could do the in-depth work on the old case like Rob Landry, besides his daughter? That meant Tori and James would have to work day and night, side-by-side. But that should not be a problem. James had too much going on to be romantically interested in the enticing P.I. And Tori had once been married to James's type before. She wasn't going to willingly dance the upper crust two-step ever again! <br />***** No one writes series suspense better than Kylie Brant! As in the three Tremaine thrillers before this one (\\"Alias Smith & Jones\\", \\"Entrapment\\", and \\"Truth Or Lies\\"), the story overflows in non-stop action and suspense. This is not a book you will be able to put down easily, consider yourself warned. So be sure you have several uninterrupted hours ahead of you before you open the cover.

Each of them thought up three people that they would love to kill once they were out of jail. Then the three swapped victims. Vince Giordano was to kill the three people on Archer Lowell's hit list, who was still serving time in prison. He did not HAVE to do it, but since Channing had gone after the three on Vince's list (in previous book titled \\"DEAD WRONG\\"), Vince felt the need to hold up his end of the verbal contract, the verbal game. The first was Derek England. The second was Marian O'Connor. The third was Amanda Crosby. <br />Amanda Crosby was furious at her business partner, Derek. Derek went to Italy to find items for their antiquities shop. What he purchased and shipped to Amanda turned out to be stolen goods. Amanda was having to send the item back to the Middle East, where it was stolen, and the shop would have to take a huge loss in money. Amanda swore she'd kill Derek, as she swears every time he did something stupid. But this time, someone killed Derek before she saw him again and Amanda's threat was still on Derek's cell phone voice mail. She instantly became the number one suspect. <br />Chief Sean Mercer of Broeder Police did not want the beautiful lady to be a killer. He was very attracted to Amanda. But Sean went by the book, so he forced himself only to think of her as \\"the suspect\\". When Marian, the lady who owned the store next to Amanda's was murdered, Sean was sure the two killings were connected. Yet he could not figure out how. It soon became apparent that the only connection between the two murdered people was Amanda. The second murder proved that it could not have been Amanda. Sean was positive it all had something to do with Amanda's old stalker, Archer. Problem was that Archer was still in prison, made no phone calls, had zero visitors, and not a single friend in jail or out. But someone was killing for Archer and Sean knew Amanda would be next. <br />***** Author Mariah Stewart gets better and better with every book she writes. I feel sorry for anyone who misses this trilogy. It is one of the best ones I've had the pleasure of reading. Mariah Stewart ROCKS! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-06-29

She lived among the Guardians and took the oath, even though she had never shown any magical abilities. She would have been content to live out her remaining days in the vast Guardian library. Fate had different plans for Gwynne. She caught the eye of Duncan Macrae, Lord of Thunder, a powerful Weather Mage of Scotland. Though attracted to each other, Gwynne refused his offer of marriage. One with such power should marry his equal. However, the Guardian Council's scrying glasses showed dark times ahead. There was talk of a Jacobite rebellion. Prince Charles, The Pretender, had landed in Scotland and civil war loomed ominously. Gwynne was all but ordered to marry Duncan. No one could see why, but as his wife Gwynne would give him balance. She could make sure his emotions never clouded his judgement. As the Lord of Thunder, Duncan's power of controlling the weather could sway the outcome of the war, which was against the Oath.<br />Soon Gywnne would learn about her own dormant mage talents and why they took so long to show. Only Gwynne's talents and her love for Duncan and the clan can keep the rivers of Scotland from running red with blood.<br />***** W-O-W-! This is not to be missed!

Gabby is deep undercover as a judge in Carnel Cove, Florida. In reality, she is a senior covert operative in the Special Detail Unit \\"SDU\\", where she works only high-risk Special Projects. The SDU is an elite group of Secret Service operatives who protect America from the world's worst terrorists. It is imperative that SDU preserves its anonymity - even if it means eliminating its best agent. <br />Gabby is dealing with a band of terrorists who have the sole purpose of bringing the world's economy to its knees by releasing a lethal virus with no known cure. The virus is dubbed \\"Z-4027\\" and is an accelerated version of \\"EEE\\" (Eastern equine encephalitis). Death is within 24 hours. When Global Warriors, an international group of hired assassins, attempts to murder Gabby, she has no way of knowing if it is due to her being a judge on a case involving them or if her cover has been blown. She has no choice but to contact Home Base and inform her commander. Gabby knows very well that it means her partner, Maxwell Grayson, will immediately be sent to \\"cancel her\\". But before Max kills Gabby, she wants to tell him everything she knows about the Z-4027 situation and where she hid the evidence. Problem is that Gabby has been infected and her memory is faltering. Max needs her information quickly. If he does not kill Gabby fast, the commander will send another unit out to cancel them both. To make things worse, Hurricane Darla has hit the area. <br />***** Even though SDU is a fictional group, everyone knows that groups such as it actually exist.

Abigail \\"Abby\\" Washburn was the petite and feisty owner of \\"Den of Antiquity\\", an antiques shop in Charleston, South Carolina. When Marina Webbfingers offered Abby the job of decorating the rooms of the B&B, Abby accepted. Abby's best friend, Wynnell Crawford, did the garden. The two friends stopped speaking when they disagreed over a cheap, three-foot-high replica of Michelangelo's David that Wynnell placed in the garden. <br />Death, disease, and mystery seemed to follow Abby where ever she went. So it should not have surprised Abby when Wynnell called her from prison. Mrs. Webbfingers had been bludgeoned to death by the statue in the garden. (The statue was later found in the harbor.) The suspects were numerous, at least to Abby. None of the current guests were who they claimed to be and Mr. Webbfingers failed to look like the grieving husband. But the police fingered Wynnell, who had just finished a very heated, verbal spat with the B&B owner. <br />***** Abby could very well be considered a female, modern day type, Sherlock Holmes. Well, except for the fact that while reading the novel Abby had me laughing aloud at the most embarrassing times. Here is a tongue-in-cheek type of mystery that will have you laughing one moment and then seriously considering the facts the next. I dare anyone to test their wits with this story!

Now he has the chance. Felicia is throwing a party. When George hears that Miss Olivia \\"Livy\\" Henshaw will attend, he agrees to go.<br />Livy is well past the normal marriageable age. She is eight years older than George. So when he begins paying attention to her, Livy assumes he sees her as a spinster aunt. He could never be interested in her romantically ... right?<br />*** This is not Elizabeth Mansfield's best work by far. However, it is still a delightfully romantic read. No real crisis, no trauma, just pure romance. Do not go by the cover as to what Livy looks like. The story says auburn hair, not brown, and the character is older than the cover's pictures suggests too. We all know the cover is sometimes wrong though.

It took the stewardess, Marjorie MacTavish, awhile to make Loretta understand that the ship was sinking and, no, she could NOT just rest in bed awhile longer. But once Loretta understands the situation, she helps the other passengers before even considering going to safety herself. Loretta is especially desperate to locate the widow, Isabel Golightly, and her six-year-old child genius daughter, Eunice. <br />Two years later finds them all residing in San Francisco. Marjorie is Loretta's secretary. Isabel has opened a dance academy and is remarried. Eunice has become even more intelligent, if that is at all possible! As for Loretta, she is still a strong willed and fiery feminist who is determined to help all the underdogs and change the world, whether they want her help or not! <br />Loretta often helps out at the Ladies' Benevolence League's Soup Kitchen, but one night after closing she rushes back to the kitchen for an item she has forgotten only to find herself manhandled by Captain Malachai Quarles. Malachai is captain of the \\"Moor's Revenge\\" Two of his crewmen, Mr. Jones and Mr. Peavey, have recently disappeared. Loretta and Malachai find Peavey unconscious on the kitchen floor, the victim of an attack. Several gold coins are scattered around. Doctor Jason Abernathy, who is sweet on Marjorie, drives over to help Peavey. Problem is that Peavey has always been scatterbrained, so when he only mutters about being held in a dungeon underneath a castle by Moors, no one is surprised and no one believes him...except Loretta. <br />Loretta and Malachai seem to rub each other the wrong way from the beginning. Yet they are both attracted to one another too. Loretta is positive that a mean associate of Malachai (and her father's) named William Frederick Tillinghurst is behind it all. Malachai is positive she is wrong. Nothing points to Tillinghurst as the guilty party, the man is highly respectable, and she should not accuse the man simply because she did not like how he handles his businesses. Two hard heads are about to clash! <br />**** Author Anne Robins has created a variety of characters for this novel. I was captivated by Malachai from the beginning, even though he is a bit too narrow minded when it comes to women. It took me awhile to warm up to Loretta though. Loretta's curiosity gets her in a lot of trouble, but she's also smart. However, once she decides she is right, she refuses to even consider that she may be wrong. She came across as way too pushy. The great part is that Malachai figures out exactly how to tame her, or at least make her shut up. They are the perfect match! <br />Don't think that this is the only entertainment the author gives us, her readers. Nope, we get to follow along as they attempt to clear up a mystery on stolen treasure. And it is all set in exciting San Francisco, during a time that America is getting used to all its modern conveniences, such as electricity and automobiles. A delightful read that I recommend to all. **** <br />(...)	2004-06-03

Jesse Chapman and Katherine \\"Katie\\" Bloom had grown up as neighbors and close friends, despite their age difference. Jesse had helped Katie as she grew up into a lovely lady. He had protected her from bullies and kept her sane when her mother ignored her which was most of the time. In return, Katie loved Jesse for who he was, regardless of his bad boy attitude and ways. Young Katie had been utterly crushed when Jesse left her behind in El Paso, Texas, while he left to become a golf pro. <br />The audience believed Katie was too prim and proper as a news anchor for KTEX TV. So her best friends Julia and Chloe, who happened to be the station's owner and manager, decided to show the public another side of Katie. \\"Getting Real With Kate\\" was done live. The first show was supposed to have a cooking theme with the guest star being a famous chef. Katie was really worried when the chef had not shown up when the two minute air time warning was announced. But when Julia walked in and threw Jesse in as a replacement for the chef, Katie panicked! And after the show, when Julia used guilt to persuade Katie into letting Jesse stay in her guest cottage, Katie came close to a panic attack! How could she possibly survive having Jesse so close to her again? How would she possibly survive when Jesse left her again? <br />Jesse Chapman was on the verge of winning the PGA Championship. The tournament was in less than a month. The magazines and tabloids constantly told of his winnings on the golf course, as well as, with the string of ladies that came and went. Recently, Jesse had saved a woman's life. The media refused to leave Jesse alone. When Jesse felt himself about to fall apart, he returned to El Paso for a vacation. Instead of relaxing, Jesse found himself still wanting Katie as his own. He also found out that he had a twelve-year-old son named Travis! <br />***** A great beginning to the \\"Sexy\\" trilogy. Travis's mother is seldom in the picture. The story focuses on Katie, Jesse,and Travis with terrific results. I would never have guessed that a book with golf in it could possibly be so much fun. The book is full of humor and witty emails exchanged between Katie, Julia, and Chloe. As for Travis, he may only be twelve, but living with his mom has given him more serious experience with how women react to things. So he is twelve, going on thirty. I still chuckle at the memory of Jesse being agog at Travis stating that Katie NEEDED to eat ice cream straight out of the carton, forget the bowl. I fell in love with the character of Travis right then! This novel is another winner by Linda Francis Lee.

Now the ladies direct their attentions to Delia's twin sister, Cassandra. <br />Miss Cassandra &quot;Cassie&quot; Effington has a talent for the refurbishment and redecoration of houses. There are no prospects of marriage in her future due, not to her business, but the fact that she dreams of Lord Perfect. Only a God could possibly meet all her expectations. However, even if Cassie was to lower her standards, she would never consider someone like Viscount Reginald &quot;Reggie&quot; Berkley. Cassie has no desire to tame a rogue and Reggie's reputation has become &quot;infamous&quot;. <br />Reggie's reputation is mainly word-of-mouth. His friends worked for almost a year to make Reggie's past sound dangerous. It was to keep ladies at bay. Instead, it only managed to keep the one lady at bay that he wishes to get closer to, Cassie. <br />Then Reggie's mother seems to suddenly be on her death bed. As a last wish, if she cannot see Reggie wed, she would at least like to see him get prepared for marriage. Since it is easier to get forgiveness than permission, she hires Cassie to redecorate several rooms. And since she is way too ill to be out of bed, Reggie is to spend a lot of time with Cassie helping her. <br />Cassie and Reggie begin on the wrong foot, but eventually become friends.

Her \\"take no prisoners\\" attitude led her to a career in the FBI. Her current assignment was to protect Sophy and Audra O'Connor, the children of Cara O'Connor who is the youngest ever female Assistant DA in San Francisco. Cara is dealing with a high profile case involving Richard Costello, big time bad guy. While Costello is trying for an appeal, someone is sending threats (in several different ways) to Cara. Fearing for her daughters, Summer is put on the job. The problem is Summer's cover. She is to be the girls' nanny! Summer knows nothing about raising children, and less than nothing about ballet lessons and teenage troubles. The older daughter is dealing with normal fifteen-year-old crisis problems and the younger daughter has special talents no one knows of. Then there is Gabe, the guy who handles landscaping and general contracting. There is just something different about him. For a \\"gardner\\" he is just too efficient. <br />Gabe Morgan is actually Navy SEAL. Senator Tate Winslow is soon to marry Cara O'Connor. Tate knows something is wrong, but Cara insists it is nothing. Tate asks a personal favor of Gabe, who is recovering from knee trouble. Gabe is mainly to secure the O'Connor home and grounds, but to also keep an eye on the people that reside within. But the new nanny is unlike anyone Gabe has ever met and Audra is just full of pranks. <br />Costello's reach is long, even from a prison cell. Summer and Gabe must team up to keep the O'Connor family safe. Ishmael \\"Izzy\\" Teague is called in by Gabe for his hacking and computer skills. But even with all three of them on the job, the O'Connor family is in trouble. <br />***** Gabe is not the only one recovering from an on-the-job wound. Summer has major physical scars that she just has not found the time to deal with. They cause some tense moments in the novel. As for the two little girls, they often stole the show, especially younger Sophy.I sincerely hope an adult version of Sophy will someday have her own story. There is lots of potential items to work with in that character. As always, Skye's talent clearly shows in the story. Every character has his or her own quirks. Romances are built up at a great pace, just as the action and suspense are. This author is not one to be missed! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-05-25

Since he was his evil father's son, he knew what to look for. Therefore, Mordi has been helping to ferret out the traitors within the Protectors. Mordi's track record was impressive! The High Elder, Zephron, decided Mordi would be the perfect assistant for Izzy, who was beginning sessions with a new client.<br />Isole \\"Izzy\\" Frost is a Level V Re-Assimilation Counselor. When an Outcast (bad guy) want to prove s/he has had a change of heart and wishes to rejoin the Protectors, a counselor is sent to give tests and decide if the Outcast is sincere or not. Izzy's primary Protector trait is empathy. She can read minds of those she touches, smell the emotions of those she does not touch, can shoot freeze beams (which makes her name so perfect), and those are just a few of her minor Protector traits. But, like Mordi, she is a Halfling. Being half mortal and half super hero means she CAN'T do some of the things that the full blooded Protectors can do easily, such as levitate. Izzy's new client is Hieronymous Black, the most notorious Outcast of the entire Protector race! Izzy's powers have never failed. Therefore, when her powers tell her that Hieronymous HAS changed, she believes it.<br />Mordi does NOT! No way. No how. It has got to be a trick. If so, why? And how could Hieronymous fool Izzy's empathy powers? It is impossible! Mordi (and some characters from previous books in this series) begin investigating. Sure enough, Mordi is on someone's hit list quickly. But nothing points to his vile sire.<br />**** Since the plot needed a big synopsis, I left out the information on Mordi and Izzy's relationship, romance. But trust me on this, the two are very attracted to each other and love is in the air!<br />Author Julie Kenner has done another outstanding job. Somehow the author makes these people with super powers seem totally normal. In fact, reading this series is as good as, if not better, than watching a new X-Men video. If I could give this novel more than the full five stars, I would. Highly recommended! *****<br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-05-21

In the year 1813, during the Peninsular War, Max went to an isle in the Mediterranean, Cyrene, on a mission of mercy. One of his lieutenants had lost a leg and was dying. Caro Evers nursed the lieutenant back to health and lost her heart to Max. Max and Caro spent one lovely time together before he went back into battle. <br />In late 1814, Caro travels to London to seek out Christopher, Viscount Thorne. Caro and Christopher are part of a secret service, the Guardians of the Sword, based on Cyrene. The Guardians' leader, Sir Gawain Olwen, need Christopher to help on a mission. It seems that &quot;Bella&quot; has been taken captive by Barbary corsairs (pirates) and enslaved in Algiers. Christopher is to travel to Algiers and locate her position. <br />Max just happens to be with Christopher, his close friend, when Caro finds him. Of course, Max returns to Cyrene to help plan the rescue. Caro is not only worried that Max will learn about the Guardians, but also about her reaction to seeing him again. <br />*** A fast paced book with an intricate plot that I cannot help but enjoy. However, there are too many adult scenes and it detracts from the story, itself. I finally reached the point of skimming the adult scenes just to get on with the plot. The love scenes became to seem as filler material. Overlooking that though, the story is excellent and the writing superb. *** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-05-19

Their souls are locked away in the Box of Souls, which can only be opened by three keys turned by human hands. In each generation three human women are born who have the means to find the three keys and end the curse. Each, in turn, has one moon phase to find a key. If the first fails, game over. If the first succeeds, the second woman takes up the quest, and so on. If any of the three mortal females fail, they each lose an undisclosed year of her life. If all three succeed, the demigoddesses will awaken and each of the three human women will receive one million dollars. <br />The first two keys have been located. Zoe is now up at bat. Zoe's demigoddess is the warrior. Her truth is Valor and Courage. The fierce mother demands her nine-year-old, Simon, be protected from Kane. In no way can Kane be able to use Simon against Zoe and her quest. Rowena and Pitte are way ahead of Zoe there. Protection spells from them, as well as, from other gods behind the Curtain of Dreams, were weaved around Simon immediately upon the second key being found. Simon's protection is guaranteed. <br />However, there is still Brad. No matter how much Zoe battles to guard her heart from Brad, she is losing it. Even if she gave her heart to Brad, what about her son? How can Zoe trust Brad not to hurt Simon? Oh, not physically. But Simon clearly enjoys Brad's company. (And the game room from heaven in Brad's mansion is a young boy's dream!) If it does not work out between her and Brad, Simon could be emotionally hurt. <br />At the same time, Brad is definitely needed to help with the quest. Since Zoe has to find the very last key, Kane, the evil sorcerer, will do ANYTHING to make sure Zoe fails! <br />***** I do not know if the first of the trilogy is my favorite or this one! Since Kane changed the rules in the last book, the quests have become deadly, to gods and mortals alike! I knew, as the reader, that this book would be the most breath taking, simply because the last demigoddess was a warrior. I knew there would be the ultimate battle, before and after the key. Therefore, needless-to-say, this book ROCKS! Fast paced, mysterious, romantic, and a bit of magic within each page of this fairy tale come to life. Highly recommended series! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-05-18

Sookie Stackhouse is a small-town cocktail waitress in Louisiana. She is a human with the special talent of telepathy. Since the Great Revelation, when vampires announced their presence to the world, everyone's eyes have opened. Sookie's first real boyfriend, Bill Compton, came around shortly thereafter. Since vampires are dead, it is tough for Sookie to hear their thoughts. It made Bill perfect for her. Until Bill cheated on her (last book) and they broke up. Through Sookie's adventures with Bill, she learned that Vampires are not the only supernatural predator in the world. But Weres, Fairies, Shifter, and the like, still did not want their presence known to humans.<br />Bill is off to Peru, on assignment, for a couple of weeks. The New Year's Eve celebration finally ends. Sookie's resolutions are to not get beaten up and to stay out of trouble. (Har-de-har-har!) The night is not even over and Sookie is driving home when she spies a man running, nude, down the road as if someone or something is after him. Turns out that he has amnesia. He has no memory of why he is tunning in the nude. He does not even know his name. Sookie does, of course. It is Eric! He is still scary and sexy, but no longer cruel and sly.<br />A coven of powerful witches have moved into the area. They plan to take over the businesses of the vampires. The leader, Hallow, cursed Eric with amnesia, but did not expect him to vanish. The witches put a huge bounty out for information on Eric's location. Sookie has the task of keeping Eric hidden in her home, until the evil witches are dealt with. Sookie knows this is dangerous, but she is more worried about how alluring the new, nicer Eric is. At the same time, Sookie's brother, Jason has disappeared.<br />**** If you do not read the previous books in this series, you will find yourself wondering why Sookie is worried about a few things. This book picks up a few weeks after the last one left off. As usual, the novel begins and ends the major plot ofthe story. But a few juicy sub-plots are left dangling, to be continued in the next. Those on-going tid-bits are one of the wonderful things the fans of this series enjoys very much! But this book does not touch on the Sookie, Bill, and Eric triangle as much. Bill is demoted to a minor character this time around.<br />The author is just as witty in her writing as always. Jason, Sookie's brother, is finally being pulled into the Supernatural mess as well. Lively (no pun intended), witty, intense, and just plain fun reading. Wonderful! ****<br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-05-17

England, 1805, seventeen-year-old Devlin Kimball had been sitting in detention awaiting the arrival of his displeased parents and little sister Sarah when the dean walked in to inform him that his Aunt Augusta was en route to pick him up. His parents and four-year-old sister had &quot;an accident&quot;. Half way to the school they had stopped at an inn to rest. The inn had caught fire, killing 47 people, including his family. The Dowager Viscountess (Augusta) Strathmore did her best with Devlin, but he eventually went adventuring on the high seas, spending his rage on the elements. <br />London, 1817, Devlin &quot;Devil&quot;, Lord Strathmore, had uncovered the dark truth about the fire at the inn. The fire had been deliberate! He also knew that one or more of the morally twisted gentlemen in the &quot;Horse and Chariot Club&quot; were to blame. Devlin vowed to learn the names of the guilty and kill them. Marriage never entered the equation. But Aunt Augusta's will changed that. <br />Elizabeth &quot;Lizzie&quot; Carlisle had been lady's companion to Augusta, who had been affectionately known to all as &quot;Lady Ironsides&quot;. Knowing how much the old lady loved her nephew, Lizzie had tricked Devlin into visiting only weeks before the lady died. Devlin had been annoyed at Lizzie at first. But his aunt had been the only person Devlin cared for anymore and understood, after awhile, why Lizzie had done it. Both of them were shocked when the will was read.

England, 1805, seventeen-year-old Devlin Kimball had been sitting in detention awaiting the arrival of his displeased parents and little sister Sarah when the dean walked in to inform him that his Aunt Augusta was en route to pick him up. His parents and four-year-old sister had &quot;an accident&quot;. Half way to the school they had stopped at an inn to rest. The inn had caught fire, killing 47 people, including his family. The Dowager Viscountess (Augusta) Strathmore did her best with Devlin, but he eventually went adventuring on the high seas, spending his rage on the elements. <br />London, 1817, Devlin &quot;Devil&quot;, Lord Strathmore, had uncovered the dark truth about the fire at the inn. The fire had been deliberate! He also knew that one or more of the morally twisted gentlemen in the &quot;Horse and Chariot Club&quot; were to blame. Devlin vowed to learn the names of the guilty and kill them. Marriage never entered the equation. But Aunt Augusta's will changed that. <br />Elizabeth &quot;Lizzie&quot; Carlisle had been lady's companion to Augusta, who had been affectionately known to all as &quot;Lady Ironsides&quot;. Knowing how much the old lady loved her nephew, Lizzie had tricked Devlin into visiting only weeks before the lady died. Devlin had been annoyed at Lizzie at first. But his aunt had been the only person Devlin cared for anymore and understood, after awhile, why Lizzie had done it. Both of them were shocked when the will was read. The problem for Lizzie was that she had already been through a broken heart before with Lord Alec. (The brother of Lizzie's best friend in the previous book titled &quot;LADY OF DESIRE&quot;.) The last thing she wanted was another man in her life! The problem for Devlin was that if anyone at the club realized his actually had come to care for Lizzie, she would be in grave danger! <br />***** EXCELLENT!

Mitchell \\"Mitch\\" Greiff, a Manhattan-based celebrity accountant, is a partner with the firm of Friedman, Greiff, & Slavin. He told everyone he was going for a vacation in Japan. Then he simply disappeared. No one seems to know if Mitch really went to Japan or if he is a victim of foul play. The only facts known is that his vacation was approved by his partners for two weeks, now it had been close to four weeks, and $14 million dollars have disappeared at the same time Mitch did. The money had been electronically transferred out of various clients' accounts. The clients have so much money that they did not even realize a good chunk of their money had disappeared. <br />Detectives Dennis Sprague and Anthony Ballestrino, of the Computer Crimes Squad, are put on the case. Whoever took the money left no trail, electronic or otherwise. All leads led to dead ends. Too many people had access to the needed keys or information. Wire transfer approvals were forged, so were bank confirmations. Now what? <br />***** Author Valerie Block took a complex mystery and turned it into a witty, fast paced novel that is sure to delight everyone! The novel does not follow just the detectives. It also follows some of the most colorful characters you will ever meet. A \\"must have\\" for your mystery collection! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-05-11

Morgan Grambling Pearce reluctantly agreed, for Ronald Palfry's sake, to leave London behind for three weeks. Morgan felt he had too much to do, with his sister, Kitty, due to marry Lord Waverly in about four short weeks, running Grambling House Publishing Company, and seeking out bed partners at night. But Ronald felt Morgan owed him this. Ronald thought he had saved Morgan's life during the war. The least Morgan could do was travel to Palfry Park in Windermere and help his father with his memoirs. After all, General Sir Janus Palfry was a war hero many times over. His stories of the times he spent in the Colonies of America, India, and all the famous people he knew would sell like mad. But Sir Janus was long-winded in his writing and needed help to edit it down. Thus Morgan found himself as a guest as Sir Janus's estate. <br />Morgan had been at Palfry Park a couple of weeks when he crashed into a Bath chair, literally. The lady within the chair seemed paralyzed and could do little more than stay where she was propped and be waited on hand and foot. Suddenly, Morgan found himself wanting to help the veiled lady, no matter how ill tempered she seemed or how often she flat out told him to leave her alone! <br />Miranda Runyon was a victim of a coaching accident that took her parents' lives over three years ago. Even though she has a fine estate on the Cornish coast called Nasrannah, Miranda cannot bring herself to return to the place where such wonderful memories of when her parents were alive and she was not crippled. Instead, she remained at Palfry Park, the home of her father's cousin, Sir Janus. Problem was that Sir Janus, his wife, and his two daughters pretended that Miranda did not exist. Alice and Mrs. Southey were hired as Miranda's caretakers, with orders to keep her hidden whenever they had house guests. It was pure chance that Morgan found her and made it his business to spend a little time each morning with her, without the rest of the family knowing. Whether she liked it or not, Miranda began looking forward to his visits and blunt speaking. With Morgan's help, perhaps Miranda could begin to recover the use of her lifeless limbs and have a reason to keep living. But first, she must face some hard truths about herself. <br />***** I will start off by stating that in all the years I have read regency romances, this is one of the very best I have ever come across! Author Nancy Butler does not give wimpy heroines or have love neatly fall into place. Instead, she creates realistic characters who act as I would expect real people to react if they found themselves in these situations! I came to care very much for Miranda. I understood how and why she felt as she did. I understood why she was so bitter. At the same time I could understand Morgan's side, his reasons for all he did. I cheered Miranda as she found the courage to attempt what doctors said she could never achieve. And just as real live, it was not easy or fast. It took hard work and determination. Through the talent of this awesome author, I got a peek into the lives of some amazing people. The only thing I hated was seeing the book end. I could not stop thinking about it or the characters in it for a long time afterwards. <br />Nancy Butler's talent shines brighter than a sunny day at the beach! All of her books are wonderful and well written. But in my humble opinion, this book is the best thus far! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-05-06

A lady, calling herself Liz Stewart, phones Mechi late at night, urgently requesting lessons in golfing. Mechi is soon transported back to the year 1561 - in Aberdeen, SCOTLAND! <br />Mechi meets Mary, as in the Queen of Scots, and becomes close friends. Then there is Lord Robert &quot;Robbie&quot; Keith, the Viscount of Kintore, the handsome Scotsman. His father, William, is Mary's guardian/protector. Of course, Mechi and Robbie are attracted. <br />Mechi, knowing her history well since her own ancestry blends with all this, feels she must try to change history and rescue Mary from her fate of being betrayed and beheaded. But how could Mechi convince the Keith Clan and Mary of what she knows will happen without them believing she is either a witch or crazy? <br />***** AWESOME! Do not worry if you know nothing about the game of golf. You do not have to and the story will not really teach you anything about the game, itself. However, you will learn history and enjoy every second of it! Will Mechi stay in the year 1561 or somehow return to 1997? One thing is for sure, I will never tell you.

Mary Costner's mother had left her half the share of a gold mine in Gregory Gulch, Colorado Territory. Mary's partner was Big Jim McCoy, a huge Irishman with a mean temper. To Mary, however, he was the father she never had. Mary dressed as a boy and went by the name of Mark so all the other miners would not bother her. The two hit several veins of gold. Every time they considered quitting, another vein showed up. Then one morning Mary woke up with a huge lump on her head, a knife in her hand, and blood everywhere. Big Jim had been murdered and Mary could remember nothing of the night before. Unable to do anything else, and determined to clear her name, Mary ran. She did not get too far before her horse threw her. Mary became unconscious in a snow drift.<br />U.S. Marshal Carter Monroe had the nickname &quot;Coldhearted Monroe&quot;. He and his deputy, Rick McCallum, were on the way to see Carter's mother. Carter Monroe was one of the best at his job, but he was always on the lookout for The Carlson Gang, who had killed his sister long ago. Carter had managed to kill three of the five men thus far. They found Mary nearly dead. Carter cared for her until they reached Judith, his mother.<br />Finding herself in the home of a U.S. Marshal, Mary pretended to remember nothing but her name. She just wanted time to figure out what to do. In the meantime, Mary would help Judith. (Even with an opera!) And hot upon her trail was John McCoy and the two evil gunslingers, Sammy and Randy Carlson!<br />***** This is the last book in the Misfit series. The author, somehow, was able to make me care for all the characters throughout the entire trilogy. Each book is a stand-alone story, but if you read all three you will see just how brightly the writing talent of Brenda K. Jernigan shines! Past characters, such as Thunder, return for an encore.

Chapters one - eight help readers develop an idea of what career they wish to strive for. Then shows how to build a strong strategy, research for opportunities, create a resume that won't get passed over or filed and forgotten, and how to shine during interviews. Chapters nine - eleven give sound advice in what to do once you have been hired. Chances are that the position you get hired for is not the one you have dreamed of.

After all, it is only 118 pages. I recall thinking to myself that it should not even take me that long to read it. WRONG! I found myself going back and rereading sections. I high lighted parts, took notes, and carried the book with me to work for a few days.

Not just a job that you could care less about in the long run. I mean a real career. The position you have dreamed about, studied for, and want with all your heart. Well there are many other people out there that want the same position you do. You must put your best foot forward and make yourself stand out. <br />That is where this gem of a book comes in handy. This book takes you from the first step of deciding upon your career, to past the last step of landing a position and beginning your long climb up the corporate latter. Chapters one - eight help readers develop an idea of what career they wish to strive for. Then shows how to build a strong strategy, research for opportunities, create a resume that won't get passed over or filed and forgotten, and how to shine during interviews. Chapters nine - eleven give sound advice in what to do once you have been hired. Chances are that the position you get hired for is not the one you have dreamed of. It is simply the first step to the climb up the corporate latter so you may reach your coveted position. These last few chapters will show you how to get up those first few rungs faster than normal. <br />***** The person who gave me this book said that I would probably cruise through the book in an afternoon. After all, it is only 118 pages. I recall thinking to myself that it should not even take me that long to read it. WRONG! I found myself going back and rereading sections. I high lighted parts, took notes, and carried the book with me to work for a few days. Personally, I have been climbing the corporate latter for several years now and found lots of advice that I could immediately put to use. <br />Whether you are in high school, college, or been part of the work force for a few decades, this book is worth every cent you pay for it.

Mary Costner's mother had left her half the share of a gold mine in Gregory Gulch, Colorado Territory. Mary's partner was Big Jim McCoy, a huge Irishman with a mean temper. To Mary, however, he was the father she never had. Mary dressed as a boy and went by the name of Mark so all the other miners would not bother her. The two hit several veins of gold. Every time they considered quitting, another vein showed up. Then one morning Mary woke up with a huge lump on her head, a knife in her hand, and blood everywhere.

She did not get too far before her horse threw her. Mary became unconscious in a snow drift. <br />U.S. Marshal Carter Monroe had the nickname \\"Coldhearted Monroe\\". He and his deputy, Rick McCallum, were on the way to see Carter's mother. Carter Monroe was one of the best at his job, but he was always on the lookout for The Carlson Gang, who had killed his sister long ago. Carter had managed to kill three of the five men thus far. They found Mary nearly dead. Carter cared for her until they reached Judith, his mother. <br />Finding herself in the home of a U.S. Marshal, Mary pretended to remember nothing but her name. She just wanted time to figure out what to do. In the meantime, Mary would help Judith. (Even with an opera!)

Thomas Fairchild seems to be going through a mid-life crisis. At least that is what his wife, Faith, believes. Understanding he needs a break she agrees to a temporary move to Cambridge, MA, even though she did NOT like the way Thomas went about telling her. Faith and their two children will housesit for Professor Ted Robinson while Thomas teaches a semester at the Harvard Divinity School. <br />While working at a homeless shelter, Faith comes face-to-face with an old boyfriend, Richard Morgan. Richard claims that he is not really homeless, but doing research for a book. Then Faith finds a diary in the old house's attic. The diary is from a past resident of the house, a miserable wife who had been virtually a prisoner in the house by her husband. The more Faith reads, the more curious she becomes. And there is still someone alive, today, who does not want the information in the diary to get out. <br />**** Sections are choppy, especially toward the beginning of the book, and I found myself getting confused. But it soon smoothed out and became a great mystery. To me, the novel was like reading an older version of the Nancy Drew series, a clean mystery with only a touch of real danger. All-in-all, readers will find this one to be a great way to spend an afternoon of light reading. **** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-04-27

The keys must be hunted one at a time. If even one woman fails at her task, the locked souls will be destroyed and each of the three huntresses will lose one year of life. Fate chooses Malory Price to search first. <br />Malory Price has always been organized. She even had her life completely outlined since the age of eight. Malory was manager of The Gallery and loved the position. However, the owner recently acquired a much younger bride, Pamela, who decided to oust Malory and take over. <br />The mysterious couple gave Malory twenty-five thousand much needed dollars, just for agreeing to search for a key that might not even exist. If the keys do exist, and all three of the women find them, they will each receive five million dollars! <br />Flynn Hennessy met Malory when his huge dog knocked her down. Malory hoped never to see him again, yet had no choice since he was the brother of Dana. Flynn joined the quest in the hope of getting closer to Malory. He never expected to fall in love with her or to watch an evil sorcerer try to kill her! <br />***** I can only hope that books two and three will be equally as fascinating! Nora Roberts has succeeded in literally bringing a fairy tale to life, in more ways than one. This story is set in present day with a subtle dose of magic. Highly recommended reading! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-04-24

She was married to Declan Blair, an Irish film actor. She had it all. <br />But everything about Robin became a lie back in 1996. Robin and her best friend, Amy Shiley, were in a horrible car accident. Robin died and Amy was mistaken for her. From then on, Amy pretended to be Robin and stepped neatly into her new life. Amy suddenly had more than she'd ever dreamed possible. <br />Amy, of course, feels guilty for assuming Robin's life, but who could it ever hurt? Then there is Paul, Robin's older brother ... the man she still loves. <br />***** An awesome novel that will capture your attention quickly and easily! I could not help but wonder how many of us would have grabbed the chance for a better life when it was offered to us on a silver platter, as it was for Amy. But the lives of the famous are not all that grand. In fact, author Carole Bellacera did a pretty good job showing how fake it could all be. (Personally, I would find fame to be a prison and not something to strive for.) The author also did an incredible job at showing the conflicts of emotion Amy goes through. Very well done!

For Crystal &quot;Crita&quot; Carter, it is something to be dreaded. Crita had left Lorain, Ohio, to become a successful tax accountant in Manhattan. She thought her past was behind her and to be ignored. Yet when news came of her father's illness, Crita felt duty-bound to return. Once home, Crita feels as though her life has been thrown into chaos. <br />Lincoln &quot;Linc&quot; is the brother Crita has always looked up to. (They share a bad secret.)

Tree has always been sturdy for her. Crita will need to lean on him again as she faces down her dark history. <br />**** Author Sophfronia Scott does a masterful job of bringing to life the characters in her novel &quot;All I Need To Get By&quot;.

Lord Thomas Dashley had been a major when he was captured by the French. To bide time for himself to heal and escape, Thomas gave false information. However, the information ended up meaning the death of his closest friend and fellow officer, Peter Wendham. <br />When Thomas returned to England he went to Peter's home to explain what had happened to Peter's sister, Miss Melisande Wendham. Melisande was most all Peter ever spoke of when referring to his home. Thomas had heard so much of her that he had formed a mental image of Melisande and was half way in love with her. Lord Thomas was determined to make amends to Melisande for his part in Peter's death and then to wed her. <br />Peter had never mentioned another sister, Miss Caroline Norcrest. Yet while Melisande condemned Thomas, Caroline did not. Caroline instinctively knew Thomas was innocent in Peter's death and she became determined to solve the mystery surrounding it. <br />***** Most Regency Romances get four stars from me. However, this one was exceptional in the subtle nuances that the author gave throughout the story, as well as, the wonderful plot and sub-plots the book contained. Rarely have I read such a wondrous piece of work. (Sandra Heath is another such author that springs to mind.) Glenda Garland spins a tapestry of greed and romance that will keep her readers enthralled until the last page has been turned.

Arrow that Flies the Farthest was the Champion of her barbarian clan, the Red Feathers. She had been trained for the task since the age of five. At fifteen she killed her first Champion. Duty and honor bound, she did as her chief, Blood on the Wind, bade her to do. In greed, he challenged each clan and had Arrow defeat their Champion in combat for their land. But when a sorcerer named Balthazar joined the Red Feather clan, they became unstoppable! Balthazar had an amulet that trapped the souls of enemies and fed his magic. Using it, he made Arrow into a berserker. Speed made her a blur to others. Her strength multiplied and her senses sharpened. When Blood forced her to kill the king of all the clans, along with women and children, she rebelled. <br />Thraxis was an Athraskani (wizard). He was the best ever born. When Balthazar stole an amulet and left the order, he also left a death trap behind for Thraxis. Thraxis managed to stay alive, but could not stop the spell. It was slowly killing him. It took all his magic to keep the spell slow. Even so, he had only months to live. <br />Arrow asked the Black Council for help in defeating Balthazar. Since Thraxis was useless to them, they sent him. On the way to meet the rebels who felt as Arrow did, Thraxis searched out another Athraskani named Viabold for aide. Many secrets were revealed to each other in their travels. Only they had a chance to stop Blood and Balthazar. <br />***** W-O-W! Here is an awesome story! I tried to keep the vital things out and reveal only what I had to in the synopsis. You will NOT be disappointed in this book! Danger, many battles, betrayal, love, and villains that seem invincible!

The queen would be forced to wed the Emperor Jahcgroth, who in turn planned to take over the entire Circle Kingdoms. <br />Suchen and the Sworn (army) were sent to meet Queen Rozah's ally, Lady Trethya, and escort her safely back to Lord Auglar. Trethya had vital information to pass. <br />Ax sent Yozerf Trihychyl, one of the Aclytese race, to help in the quest. Humans often considered his race no more than servants. Yozerf did not care for the Humans with good reasons. However, he owed Ax his life and agreed to do as asked. Yozerf was more than an Aclytese half breed though. He was a warrior ... and more! <br />Before it all ends, this group must battle winged demons with gargoyle shaped bodies, betrayal from within, and sorcery! <br />**** A very good story here!

The judge presiding places five-year-old John Paul \\"Tiger\\" and his little sister, Hannah \\"Stinky\\", in Nikki's care pending their parents' trial. (Yes, unusual. The author did well on explaining how and why.) <br />Deputy Commonwealth's Attorney Rebecca Crawford (A.K.A. the Barracuda) is up for election soon and uses the case to her advantage for good press. With the public watching her every move, she pulls all the tricks in her arsenal against the Hammonds. <br />Nikki goes for back up in the form of Professor Charles Arnold. Charles teaches at Regent Law School and is a street evangelist. Between the two of them, they know every legal trick in the books ... and some that are not. <br />**** This is a wonderful story for all fans of court TV or fictional legal books. I estimate that about half the book is set in the court room. So if you do not care for that, avoid this novel. However, the author does an incredible job of explaining it all in terms that any layman can understand. Nothing will overwhelm you.

Yet the lady ran away anytime his mother came near. <br />**** Author Lynn Collum place this Regency Romance in a country setting and made it interesting by adding the hobby/art of ballooning into it! I have read very few romances with ballooning in them, but have enjoyed every one immensely. This one is no exception! The heroine, Ella, is not a weeping leading lady either. She is very spirited and has a level head on her shoulders. Thank goodness, since I detest wimpy ladies. Excellent story that only loosely resembles the fairy tale of Cinderella!	2004-04-07

Kilbeinn Castle, which had been only ruins before, had somehow become tall, sturdy, and full of life. The Clan Mackenzie dwelled in the keep. Callum and Malcolm had chanced upon Brian and took him to the castle for treatment by Caira.<br />Caira Mackenzie was Laird of the clan. Her father and husband were dead. All the able-bodied men had left to join the notorious William Wallace when Caira's father had signed a treaty of neutrality with King Edward. Thus all the care and protection of the clan fell on her slim shoulders. Caira had no way of knowing if Brian was part of the foul Englishmen in the fort nearby or not. Wisely, she kept wary and sent him to the fort, by way of Callum and Malcolm, when he was well. Upon finding out Brian was NOT with those from the fort, and seeing him stand up to the cruel English, the two escorted Brian back to the keep. Caira allowed Brian time to &quot;experiment&quot;. She never understood what the black powder was that Brian was experimenting with or what he meant to do with the foul smelling powder.<br />Brian wanted only to return to the year 2004.

However, only two days later Sybil was found dead in the Thames, seemingly by suicide. Filled with remorse, Lucas made a vow of celibacy to last for one year. He left London for Cornwall, the small village of St. Ives, and found himself in the middle of smugglers.<br />Bliss Hartley was the daughter of a squire. Her father was ill and Bliss, along with everyone else in the village, turned to smuggling for money. She only wanted to make enough to take her father to a specialist in London. But there was a traitor within the smugglers ranks.<br />I must skip much here. The author has placed many surprises in this little village for her readers. To tell any more would give SO MUCH away. Therefore, let us fast forward.<br />Bliss and Luc marry and return to London. It became obvious that the talk of Lady Sybil's death had not yet ceased. Bliss was faced with trusting her husband, though he still kept a few secrets from her and had bluntly informed her not to expect him to remain faithful to her. Lucas did not believe he was in love with Bliss and kept trying to put distance between them.<br />***** I did NOT want to see this series end. Each Rogue's story has touched my heart, but this one even more so than the others. Bliss and Lucas are so well matched. I would say that I will miss them, but I know I will be rereading this story again very soon. All three in this series have been placed on my &quot;Keeper&quot; shelf. The author, Connie Mason, has proven that she is a gifted story teller, especially in the Regency era.<br />Word has it that the author's next release will be in November 2004, titled &quot;THE PIRATE PRINCE&quot;.

Soon afterward Dom said his final fair well to Mickey. <br />But it was too late. When one of the bad guys fell in love with Amber, they decide to go on a date behind her husband's back. And she insisted that Dom had to double date with Michelle. Like it or not, Michelle was about to be in the line of fire! <br />***** Now this one has some serious action in it! An awesome addition to what is becoming an addictive little series. Jessica makes a few cameos which made the story even more realistic to me. Readers, this is an author to keep your eye on. She seems to get better with each book she writes! Recommended! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-03-19

How could Ariel ever hope for a happy marriage with Cray when he thought SHE had been in on her mother's scheme? Ariel had another need to worry as well. As a child, her father had molested her. When Cray eventually found out on their wedding night that she was not chaste, he would assume the worst.

Set mostly in the year of 1870, Bounty Hunter Ryder Storm was hired by Adelaine Montgomery to hunt down Cheryl Donovan. Adelaine accused Cheryl of murdering her husband, Charles Montogomery, three months ago.<br />It took Ryder four months to locate her. Cheryl had changed her name. She went by the name of Cheri Henderson and had a two year old son, Joey. Ironically, she lived with his own good friends, the McGregor Family. After only six months in Tucson, Arizona, all the McGregor's considered Cheri and Joey to be part of the family. They all knew the truth about Cheri being raped years ago and Joey being the result. They were the only ones who knew and did not care. Cheri loved her son, Joey, and so did all the members of the McGregor household.<br />Cheri worked as a waitress in Charlie's Saloon, but that was ALL she did. The other women took &quot;clients&quot; upstairs for extra pay, but never Cheri. After being harmed by one man, Cheri knew that she would never be able to stand the touch of a man again. &quot;Bas&quot; McGregor escorted her safely home each night, just in case any men tried anything funny to the woman he cared so much about.<br />All the McGregors knew Ryder was in town on business. They did not know who Ryder was after, but they were glad to see him whenever he was in the area. Ryder and Cheri clashed on first sight. But since they both loved the large family, they were as civil to each other as possible. It was an attraction to each other that caused the clashing. It was that attraction that kept Ryder from just taking Cheri back to face the widow. The more he learned, the more Ryder doubted that Cheri killed Charles Montogomery.<br />***** I seldom read a historical romance this good. (The only thing wrong with this story is the cover of the novel. The heroine on the cover does not match the description of Cheri in the book.) Once I began this story, I simply could NOT put it down. So I read the entire story in one sitting. It is THAT wonderful! Now I can only hope that Adelaine's daughter has her story told next. Highly recommended reading! *****<br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-03-17

The pact let them feel a little better about it though.<br />Jessica works in financial for the company HardWire. HardWire may be bought out by JCN. It would all be up to Adam Taylor, a consultant brought in by JCN to report on HardWire's buy-out potential.

So no matter how hot Jessica believes Adam is, she must resist him at all costs. <br />Adam only knows that he wants Jessica. It hurts to think of her as a person instead of an employee number since he was going to cut her job. How could she fall in love with the man who was going to have her laid off? Regardless, JCN did not need her department. What Adam needs to do is convince Jessica that she needs him more than she needs her dreams. <br />**** This one is light reading material.

It is Spring, 1821. \\"The Ladies Society for the Betterment of the Future of Britain\\" are at it again! In the last novel (titled \\"The Lady In Question\\") the ladies' attentions were on Lady Delia Effington and Viscount Tony St. Stephens. Now the ladies direct their attentions to Delia's twin sister, Cassandra. <br />Miss Cassandra \\"Cassie\\" Effington has a talent for the refurbishment and redecoration of houses. There are no prospects of marriage in her future due, not to her business, but the fact that she dreams of Lord Perfect. Only a God could possibly meet all her expectations. However, even if Cassie was to lower her standards, she would never consider someone like Viscount Reginald \\"Reggie\\" Berkley. Cassie has no desire to tame a rogue and Reggie's reputation has become \\"infamous\\". <br />Reggie's reputation is mainly word-of-mouth. His friends worked for almost a year to make Reggie's past sound dangerous. It was to keep ladies at bay. Instead, it only managed to keep the one lady at bay that he wishes to get closer to, Cassie. <br />Then Reggie's mother seems to suddenly be on her death bed. As a last wish, if she cannot see Reggie wed, she would at least like to see him get prepared for marriage. Since it is easier to get forgiveness than permission, she hires Cassie to redecorate several rooms. And since she is way too ill to be out of bed, Reggie is to spend a lot of time with Cassie helping her. <br />Cassie and Reggie begin on the wrong foot, but eventually become friends. As friends, they make a wager. Cassie would try to find Reggie his \\"Miss Wonderful\\". Reggie would try to find Cassie's \\"Lord Perfect\\". Reggie enters the bet knowing he will turn down every lady Cassie find for him and he would introduce Cassie ONLY to men he is sure she will turn down. Because he intends to be her Lord Perfect! <br />***** How I love those scheming mothers! This tale is as good as the first, if not more so. Author Victoria Alexander seems to be getting better with each book she writes. The characters are life-like and I found it very easy to care for them. The more I read, the more I realized that this author has a devious side. Readers cannot help but enjoy the stories that Victoria Alexander comes up with.

She was a boat-smuggler whose only thought was to kidnap a Healer to cure her hidden village, even if it killed her. Mahri had a high tolerance for zabba, but even with all the power the root gave her she could not save her village without the knowledge Healers had. When she finally kidnapped a Healer, he turned out to be Prince Korl Com'nder! Even so, Mahri could not return the Prince of Sea Forest until her village was safe. <br />Korl was the most arrogant, spoiled-rotten man with an extremely healthy ego. He fell for Mahri even when he had woken up to find that Mahri had taken control of his muscles with her root enhanced powers and was knocking out his guards with her bone staff. She WOULD be his! What he wanted, he got! He just had to make her understand it.<br />Korl was a Healer first, a Prince second. But when they realized the only way to save the village was to have a Bond of Power, they still hesitated. A Bond was for life, unbreakable. Whenever one of them died, the other would too. They would be One, knowing each other inside and out. They would See into each other's very souls. They would share power...until death.<br />Korl's time with Mahri and her village would change him. However, when he finally returned to the Palace Tree, his half-sister would do all she could to kill him and take the Crown. Only Mahri could save him. Together, Mahri and Korl would change the entire world as they knew it! <br />***** In a single word, &quot;Wow!&quot; I mean W-O-W-! I have never read such a wonderful tale as this. Kathryne Kennedy's computer must smolder from the power she creates in her stories! I simply cannot describe how awesome or how thrilling I found this novel to be.

Sybil had tried to entrap Luc into marriage and failed. She desperately admitted to being pregnant by a married man and need to wed quickly. Lucas promised to help her find a husband within the next two weeks. However, only two days later Sybil was found dead in the Thames, seemingly by suicide. Filled with remorse, Lucas made a vow of celibacy to last for one year. He left London for Cornwall, the small village of St. Ives, and found himself in the middle of smugglers. <br />Bliss Hartley was the daughter of a squire. Her father was ill and Bliss, along with everyone else in the village, turned to smuggling for money. She only wanted to make enough to take her father to a specialist in London. But there was a traitor within the smugglers ranks. <br />I must skip much here. The author has placed many surprises in this little village for her readers. To tell any more would give SO MUCH away. Therefore, let us fast forward. <br />Bliss and Luc marry and return to London. It became obvious that the talk of Lady Sybil's death had not yet ceased. Bliss was faced with trusting her husband, though he still kept a few secrets from her and had bluntly informed her not to expect him to remain faithful to her. Lucas did not believe he was in love with Bliss and kept trying to put distance between them. <br />***** I did NOT want to see this series end. Each Rogue's story has touched my heart, but this one even more so than the others. Bliss and Lucas are so well matched. I would say that I will miss them, but I know I will be rereading this story again very soon. All three in this series have been placed on my \\"Keeper\\" shelf. The author, Connie Mason, has proven that she is a gifted story teller, especially in the Regency era. <br />Word has it that the author's next release will be in November 2004, titled \\"THE PIRATE PRINCE\\". Though it will not be set in London, (Perhaps the author can be persuadedto return to London again in the near future.) I look forward to the next adventure.

Lady Alexandra Marshall, future Countess Ware, had once been married to Christopher Donally. The marriage had not lasted long. Alex watched helplessly as her irate father had Christopher shipped off to India and the marriage annulled. She waited for him to return to her, only to be disappointed. He did not return. <br />It was ten years before Christopher showed up again and it was NOT for Alex. He wanted nothing to do with the aristocracy. He was heir to D&B Steel and Engineering and wanted only to run his business. While doing so, Christopher planned to give his sister, Brianna, her launch into Society. He never expected to see Alexandra or for her to ask for his help.<br />Lady Alexandra had kept herself sane by devoting herself to the British Museum as an archaeologist. When she realized gems had been stolen from artifacts and replaced by fakes, she reported it to the head curator. However, she quickly learned that the museum would rather ruin her career and reputation than admit to the thefts. She went to Christopher for help. In exchange, Alexandra would support Brianna's launch.<br />***** A splendid addition to the Regency era is author Melody Thomas! She somehow made the hero and heroine total opposites, yet perfect for each other. While Lady Alexandra has no siblings and only her work, Sir Christopher has a huge Irish family who enjoys beating up on each other, especially during games such as croquet. To watch these two main characters go head-to-head is sheer delight! This one will hit your \\"Keeper\\" shelf! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-03-10

Laura McCloud used to visit Pilgrim Cove every summer. As a teen, she met Matthew \\"Matt\\" Parker. They even kissed under the boardwalk. Laura had missed several summers. She had been taking care of her dying mother and dealing with her own medical trauma, breast cancer. <br />As the story opened, Laura's mother had passed away. Laura had detected the lump early, underwent treatment, and had just been given a clean bill of health. She retreated to Pilgrim Cove to lick her wounds and get away from the city. She needed the beauty of the small town she remembered, to watch the waves crash upon the beach, and a couple months of solitude. Laura began it all with a call to Bartholomew \\"Bart\\" Quinn and rented Sea View House. <br />Matt had never forgotten Laura. His family had always been known for their musical talents, and she had a voice that was unforgettable. When Matt learned who had rented the town's special house, his interest was immediate. (That house had a reputation, good things happen to everyone who stays there.) Matt's wife had died four years ago. He now had two sons: Brian, age eleven (going on thirty), and Casey, age seven, with a speech problem. <br />Could Matt trust Laura not to hurt his sons? Could Laura trust Matt not to walk out on her? <br />***** I love Pilgrim Cove! The entire town is filled with the most colorful characters you can imagine. There is even a group of retired men, called the ROMEOs, that gather at the diner to watch the town's soap opera life play out. Then, of course, they jump on their cell phones to spread the word all over the little town. Worse than old women. ;) <br />Author Linda Barrett brings this town to life, as only she could possibly do! I came to love all the secondary characters, as well as the main ones. Each person in the story has their own little quirks and attitudes.

Lady Nicolaa of Cheneteberie had already been given four husbands from the king. All four had asked Henry to set the marriage aside and had gotten new brides. Word had it that Nicolaa could not produce children. After being harshly handled by four husbands, she never wanted a fifth. The king sent her one anyhow. Nicolaa did her duty. She married him, Rowland the Dark. She knew he would leave quickly too. The fact did not displease her. Her heart had become well armored. Besides, Rowland's heart would forever belong to his deceased love, Lubias. <br />Sir Rowland d'Albret of Aquitaine knew she could not give him an heir. He did not want one. Nicolaa was worthy and would make a fine wife. He vowed to protect her and be gentle, unlike her previous husbands. Yet even though he would not ever give Nicolaa his heart, he believed she should, and would, give him hers! <br />**** Be warned, though a willing wife, the consummation of the marriage is harsh ... almost to be called rape, in my opinion. The entire book focuses on the two main characters. The secondary characters, in no way, detract from their tale. Rowland and Nicolaa seem to be very strong willed people. This makes for many battles between them and great reading for the readers. My only real complaint is that the villain seldom made an appearance.

When she was years past the normal age of being wedded, her father and brother betrothed her to Sir Gavin. Noelle was sent to Camelot to meet the well-known and brave knight before a Christmastide wedding. Yet, it was another knight that drew Noelle's attention.<br />Sir Nicholas the Dragon was known for his bravery and loyalty to King Arthur. He was a knave who had left many broken hearts in his wake. His childhood had been cruel. He had been forced to become a man at the tender age of ten just to survive. None before Noelle seemed to call to his heart. Never the less, she was promised to another and he must forget her.<br />***** W-O-W! I have always loved the tales of magical Camelot!

Chandler was obsessed with unveiling the thief. At the same time, he was attracted to Millicent.<br />*** This story has a good plot and a heroine with a level head on her shoulders, except when the hero is around.

Hart met a young lady chasing a piglet through the house and assumed her to be a servant. <br />I must skip much here or spoil the highly amusing happenings. The reader knew from the beginning that the servant was really Lady Althea &quot;Thea&quot;, the Earl's daughter.

While in Paris Lord Matthew &quot;Matt&quot; Weston met and married the woman of his dreams. Yet only a few hours later she left him, leaving behind a letter that she would deal with the legalities. He had not known her REAL name or title. He only knew how much he loved her. After fifteen months, she walked back into his life. <br />She was Princess Tatianna Marguerite Nadia Pruzinsky of the Kingdom of Greater Avalonia, and she needed his help. Tat still loved Matt. However, she felt she HAD to leave him so she could finish fulfilling her royal duties. She planned to return to him someday, if he would still have her, once her duties were completed. For now, she needed him to escort her around London as his wife. As Lady Matthew she could retrace the steps of Aunt Sophia. Tat told him that she was writing the history of the royal family. It was obvious he did not believe her. As his wife, doors would be open for her to speak with those who knew Sophia, decades ago. The truth of what Tat was up to was kept secret. Tat was searching for something that she felt MUST be found before she could return to Matt forever. <br />*** I found this story to be complicated. Several sub-plots ran simultaneously, such as, the Princess Valentina being in England, some history of ballooning (aerostats), and some jewels. That was only a few of them. About half into the book, however, things began to come together. I, as the reader, got a clearer picture of what was REALLY going on. Romance between the two main characters seemed stilted until this point. <br />The second half of the book was filled with perils and romance! I could not pull myself away from it all. Everything seemed to speed up and I simply HAD to know what was going to happen in the next chapter! I admit that much of the information that the first half of the book was needed for the reader to fully understand the seriousness of the plot. Yet I feel many readers will not be able to wait so long for all the pieces to cometogether. <br />As a reviewer, I must say that I feel the first half of this book seemed to drag. The second half was non-stop. Somehow I believe reviews will be mixed on this tale. This story you will either love or hate. No middle ground. *** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-03-04

Story is set in November of 1932, during the bleak Depression. Hoover is still the President and election date (for Roosevelt) is only a weekend away. Lily and Robert Brewster, like most others of the time, did not have much money. So when a disguised stranger offers to pay very well for a single weekend use of the guest section of the house for a few business associates, they agree. But one of the guests ends up murdered in his bath. They, along with Chief of Police Howard Walker, are up to their necks in suspects! At the same time, Lily and Robert are filling in as teachers because one of the staff has disappeared and reporters are showing up everywhere!<br />**** Excellent mystery that readers can sink their mental teeth into. The cover and title of the book are very misleading though. They look as if they belong on a romance, not a mystery. So do not judge THIS book by its cover! The story inside is wonderfully crafted and will keep readers guessing until the end draws near. Reading this novel is a great way to spend a rainy afternoon. **** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-03-04

In fact, their back yards touched each other. They spent all their time together and knew each other so well you would think they were sisters. <br />Darla grew up and married Cal. Joanne, always considered the bad girl, had been thrown out of her parents' house and lived alone with a small dog. But the two were still best friends, still like sisters. Eventually, Joanne agreed to carry a baby for Darla, who was infertile. No doctors were involved. Cal got Joanne pregnant the normal way. To Darla, all seemed right with the world. Then one day Joanne, four or five months pregnant, showed up at Darla's home, needing desperately to say something, but couldn't. She left, agitated. She returned in the middle of the night, in an unexpected way. Joanne had been returning to Darla's home and ended up crashing through the bedroom wall. Joanne was brain dead, but the unborn baby was still okay. <br />In the months that follow, Darla tries to figure out what events led Joanne up to that tragic moment. Secrets are uncovered about Joanne that Darla never dreamed existed and a custody battle is in full swing. <br />**** This book starts out with Joanne's car coming through the wall of Darla's home! Needless-to-say, that will capture your interest instantly. From then on the secrets keep coming and you will be turning the pages as quickly as possible to see what will happen next. The only time the novel slows down too much is during court scenes. If you are looking for high drama, here it is! **** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-03-04

That siege was where he first met the White Knight. However, once the castle had been claimed, the White Knight was nowhere to be found. Instead there was the lady of the keep, Vanora. The earlier battle had allowed cover for the escape of Daffid of Deverell and the White Knight. Lionheart soon had a vendetta against the elusive White Knight. In the meantime, Lionheart found himself obsessed with Vanora. His honor refused to allow him to simply claim her as the spoils of war. She was loyal to Wales and Llewelyn. He was loyal to England and Prince Edward. To have her, he would have to marry her. <br />Lord Rhys of Cragdon, Vanora's father, had died the Winter before. His warriors were now loyal to Vanora. But they were no match for Lionheart's forces. Through cunning, she helped her warriors escape, enraging Lionheart no end. Yet as she fought him, she could not stop herself from wanting him. To have him, though, would be a form of betrayal. <br />**** A steamy romance, wrought with betrayal, that will ensnare readers quickly. There are times the book seemed to slow down where romance is concerned. However, it overflows with battles and is historically accurate. It is immediately apparent that Vanora is the White Knight. No reader could NOT catch on to that fact before the castle is even captured. Yet the author kept the battle scenes of the White Knight realistic by making the allusive knight slim, wield a lighter sword, and not be as well trained as the men in that time frame. This is not Connie Mason's best work, by far, but I still found myself hooked in the story and unable to stop reading until the last page had been turned. Well worth your time and money. **** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-03-04

It led her to a sixteen year old Crow named Lone Arrow. He helped Carolyn escape a bear by entering a sacred treasure cave. He warned her to take nothing. The treasure in the cave was cursed.

Thus she traveled back to the Bighorn Mountains and into Lone Arrow's life again. <br />Lone Arrow, like his father before him, was the speaker and protector of the mountains. He was the chosen one to guard the sacred treasure cave. His guide was the spirit of the mountain who took the form of a small whirlwind. Lone Arrow wanted Carolyn as his wife, but did not trust her.

Olivia &quot;Livie&quot; had been very young when she married Quinton Thorpe and became the Duchess of Brandhurst. For almost twenty-five years she lived with her husband's cruelty by shutting off all emotions. As the book opened, I learned Quinton had been murdered, stabbed in the back with a letter opener by an unknown person (while trying to kill Olivia), and Livie was still in shock. <br />Few knew the Duke had been murdered. Those few, which included Olivia, felt the Duke had gotten what he deserved. So the murder was covered up and kept quiet. The title fell to Andrew Thorpe, an American. Until he could settle his affairs and get to England, Livia was to be in charge. <br />Neville Thorpe, second in line for the title, was jealous. He stayed by his Aunt Olivia's side and took charge of everything in her for her. He used his time to plot and scheme ways of obtaining the title he so coveted. He was aided by Quinton's wicked valet, Antonio. Neville found Olivia to be easily controlled until ... <br />Clara Peabody was an advocate with the Ladies' National Association. She approached Olivia, a year after the Duke's death, about helping fight to help the suffering of the match factory ladies. Olivia's eyes opened to possibilities and she developed a backbone. <br />Willoughby Barnes was an unknown artist. Since his deceased father had worked in the Duke's garden, Will had grown up learning the trade. He was asked to design the garden around the Duke's burial plot. Out of money for paints, he agreed. There, Olivia and Will met and fell in love. Olivia felt true love for the first time. However, Livie was forty and a duchess while Will was in his twenties and a gardner. It could never work. <br />***** The author, Julie Beard, keeps the reader guessing as to who really murdered the Duke. At the same time, she succeeds in keeping romance, betrayal, compassion, and several wonderful sub-plots going in the story. Normally this would not work. However, Julie Beard MADE it work! It all blends smoothly together and becomes as beautiful as Will's painting of Olivia!

The only real difference that I noticed was that this novel was not written in the first person view. I saw more than what just the heroine saw too. Filled with romance, danger, non-human beings, and suspense this story is sure to please! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-02-29

Long ago a meteor fell onto Earth with a magical, metallic form within it. Witnessing its power, it was forged into the (thought of) holy form of a triangle and a temple was formed to protect it. A city grew around the temple, The People of the Light were there. During an invasion, the nine planets aligned and the power of the Triangle was shown. Realizing no mortal should possess such power, the High Priest ordered it cut into two smaller triangles. One stayed at the temple. The other was hidden at the end of the Earth. However, the Craftsman who cut the Triangle in half secretly made a highly advanced device. It could serve as a guide to find the hidden piece, and preserve the Triangle's powers for future generations. It was a magic clock.<br />Lady Lara Croft was much like her father had been. Beginning with a clock he had hidden for her to find someday and tales he had told her as a child, she must set out to save the world. The Illuminati, a secret group of powerful people, were out to find the two triangle pieces before the planets aligned (which happened only once every 5,000 years). At her side was Mr. Hillary, her butler, and Bryce, her technician. Two tombs must be entered and survived or the world would belong to Manfred Powell.<br />***** I made that brief as possible, but left out much to do it. Even though the movie, as of now, has not been released, I can already tell that the book gives much more insight to Lara and the adventure in which she finds herself. However, many scenes have the potential to be much more vivid and exciting on the big screens! I found it to be a wonderful book! I plan to be in the theater, with a huge group of friends, on its first night out! *****<br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-02-24

Dr. Cherijo Torin had come to terms with finding out she was a clone of her &quot;father&quot;. She learned to adjust to the fact that her Jorenian lifemate, Kao Torin, was dead. She was even doing well as a Healer among her adopted Jorenian race on the ship Sunlace. But the ship had been sabotaged and the Jorenian Warriors were out for blood! The culprit would be found and the right of ClanKill would take place! This meant the guilty one would be disemboweled (while he still breathed) by Jorenian claws. The Jorenians had many different decorations made out of the entails before the body was displayed as a warning to others not to hurt anyone of the Clans! Since Cherijo had been the Chosen of Kao, she was now of Clan Torin. Thus, any harm to her meant death by ALL of the Clans. <br />Reeves from Kevarzangia Two (book one) returned as well. So he is among the fighting when Dr. Grey Veil and the League (and bounty hunters and merchs, etc) come with weapons blazing! <br />***** This book is just as WONDERFUL as book one was! It has several surprises and twists to keep the reader off center. I especially recommend it to all the Honor Harrington fans out there! Cherijo's story is a masterpiece and S.L.

She knew all about death and each stage the bodies go through. She had seen just about everything and had the nightmares to prove it. Her past gave her the ability to examine mountains of evidence and see hidden connections between victims and their killers. She was very good at her job because she was tenacious! <br />U.S. Marshal Quinn Diamond had been searching for Amy Ireland for over twenty years. The case was personal, possibly linked to the death of his father. He linked Amy with a friend in Chicago who had been murdered. Lisa O'Malley had handled the crime scene, so Quinn went to Lisa for help. However, by doing so, he put Lisa's life at risk! <br />Quinn had been friends with the entire O'Malley clan for years. Lisa was the one who touched a cord deep within him though. Unlike him, Lisa did not believe in the Resurrection. Her past had made it virtually impossible for her to do so. Even her siblings, Kate and Marcus, thought she had good reasons. But that would not stop them from trying to help her understand. <br />***** I love Inspirational books written by Dee Henderson. Why? Glad you asked! Dee does not try to shove the bible at her readers. Even if the readers are not religious, they will still enjoy the book since it is mostly Romantic Suspense! I especially recommend this book for fans of the TV show CSI, Crime Scene Investigators.

Laura McCloud used to visit Pilgrim Cove every summer. As a teen, she met Matthew \\"Matt\\" Parker. They even kissed under the boardwalk. Laura had missed several summers. She had been taking care of her dying mother and dealing with her own medical trauma, breast cancer. <br />As the story opened, Laura's mother had passed away. Laura had detected the lump early, underwent treatment, and had just been given a clean bill of health. She retreated to Pilgrim Cove to lick her wounds and get away from the city. She needed the beauty of the small town she remembered, to watch the waves crash upon the beach, and a couple months of solitude. Laura began it all with a call to Bartholomew \\"Bart\\" Quinn and rented Sea View House. <br />Matt had never forgotten Laura. His family had always been known for their musical talents, and she had a voice that was unforgettable. When Matt learned who had rented the town's special house, his interest was immediate. (That house had a reputation, good things happen to everyone who stays there.) Matt's wife had died four years ago. He now had two sons: Brian, age eleven (going on thirty), and Casey, age seven, with a speech problem. <br />Could Matt trust Laura not to hurt his sons? Could Laura trust Matt not to walk out on her? <br />***** I love Pilgrim Cove! The entire town is filled with the most colorful characters you can imagine. There is even a group of retired men, called the ROMEOs, that gather at the diner to watch the town's soap opera life play out. Then, of course, they jump on their cell phones to spread the word all over the little town. Worse than old women. ;) <br />Author Linda Barrett brings this town to life, as only she could possibly do! I came to love all the secondary characters, as well as the main ones.

He talks about docs performing autopsies outside on the ground, in the dirt, in the rain.<br />He discusses little known facts about projects USAMRIID has been working on (Counters to weaponized Ebola that the Russians have) and other little known facts like that the Ebola outbreak in Reston VA was Spread by Aerosol! It just happened not to be a strain that was easy to catch by humans (Even though lab workers ALL suddenly showed antibodies to Ebola in their blood, and several got &quot;flu like symptoms&quot; from it). I Was always lead to believe that the workers &quot;Coincidently got the flu&quot;.. not true, they had a mild case of Ebola!<br />He talks about 1st world close calls, like the little girl returning to Britain on a mail plane with a doctor that was sick from Ebola (The Doc died).. even though she was in close physical contact with him, miraculously, she didn't catch it.. There have been SEVERAL of these close calls in several countries, the USA included.<br />He also discusses how diseases suddenly &quot;pop up out of no where&quot; as Asians and Africans move into more remote regions. They STILL do not know what animal host carries Ebola. Ebola is a HIGHLY mutable disease, which is why the Russians grabbed it for Bio-weapons... He predicts we'll see it many more times in the future.<br />For some reason, Americans think that &quot;maybe a few hundred people have died from Ebola&quot;.. this is not true.. there have been several outbreaks in Africa, killing MANY THOUSANDS and forcing troops to quarentine whole cities.<br />***** Excellent book.

He had sent Amanda letters, documenting the suspicious activities of Commodore Locke. But no one in the Admiralty would listen to her. Amanda and her grandmother stayed in London. It was large enough to give them some anonymity. Amanda worked as a seamstress to support them. Her childhood friend was now Lieutenant Harry Morgan. He was the only one that did not shun them. He would do all he could to help. <br />Captain Sir Jonathan Everly's leg was wounded in the Battle of Lissa. He wanted nothing more than to get back on his ship and out to sea. First he must complete a mission for Admiral Lord St. Vincent. The Admiralty had a traitor within! Worse, there seemed to be more than one! Rear Admiral William Locke was suspected, but proof was needed. <br />Since Jonathan was one of the five captains that judged her father, it took quite a bit for Amanda to trust him. However, she refused to be left out of the loop or to simply hand over her father's documents. So they had to tread the thin ice of trust between each other and unnerving attraction they felt to find evidence of the traitor, any conspirators, and to restore the family name of Tremayne to honor! <br />***** This is NOT one to miss! Danger lurks on each page and tension is high! Oh, the romance is there too, not to worry. I was unable to put this one down for more than a few minutes. I had to see what was going to happen next!

She was from a small town in North Carolina, where everyone knew everyone else's business. Her deceased husband, Wesley Lloyd Springer, had been with the bank and had been a powerful man around the town. Julia and Wesley had been big members of their Presbyterian church, ran by Pastor Ledbetter. As for how Mr. Springer died, Julia heard her husband pull up in the driveway, right on time, but never came in. When she went out to check on him, she found him dead, slumped over his steering wheel. Miss Julia learned, quickly, how to write checks, balance the check book, and all the other little things her husband refused to let her bother her little mind with. So Miss Julia had no idea just how well off her husband was, monetary anyway. But as sole beneficiary, she was set to live comfortably for the rest of her life. Then her entire world was turned up-side-down. <br />Miss Julia answered her door one morning to find a young woman, Hazel Marie Puckett, standing there. Hazel informed Miss Julia that the little boy with her was Wesley Springer's son, Wesley Lloyd Junior Springer. Seemed that Miss Julia's husband had been keeping a second household for several years, right under Miss Julia's nose. Since Little Lloyd and Hazel received nothing from Wesley's will, Hazel needed to go off to Raleigh, for a short time, to learn a trade. Once done, and she could support herself and her son, Hazel would return to pick up Little Lloyd. <br />Needless-to-say, Miss Julia was shocked! And rightfully so! The whole town began talking about her. Things got worse fast! Pastor Ledbetter was mad that Miss Julia refused to give a huge chunk of her money to the church and began to find other ways to get hold of it. Miss Julia even found out that the Pastor KNEW of her husband's adultery and approved! Then there was Brother Vern, a televangelist, and kin to Hazel. He was after any money Wesley had left Hazel and would doANYTHING to get it, including physical abuse to Hazel and, perhaps, Little Lloyd. <br />***** This is one of the most outrageous and hilarious books I have had the pleasure to read in such a long time!

He is even willing to break off his engagement to prove he prefers Callie. <br />But is he really a new, improved, socially responsible Jack Walker? Or is he still a playboy? And can he ever accept the secret Callie has kept hidden her entire life?<br />***** Callie Burke and Jack Walker were introduced in the romantic suspense book, \\"An Unforgettable Lady\\", which hit book stores only a few weeks ago. You do not need to read the previous book, which is Grace and John's story, to totally understand this one though. Both books easily stand alone. However, this story will mean more to you if you do read both books. Grace and \\"John\\" are secondary characters in this novel, along with another hot bachelor, Gray. <br />The author succeeds in giving each character their own personality, which is not an easy thing to accomplish! No suspense in this tale, but the plot rolls along at a wonderful pace and the reader never has time to get bored. Recommended to all! Now if only Gray could someday get his own story told. ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-02-12

New York was in \\"brown-out\\" mode, Frank Sinatra was new to show biz, and the sweet voices of the Andrew Sisters rode the air waves. <br />The Canteen mainly catered to the U.S. Servicemen. Dedicated volunteers, often including such stars as Katherine Hepburn, helped entertain the military personnel on leave before they had to go back on duty. <br />Genevieve \\"Jenny\\" Rose was a theater actress. She helped out the Canteen and rehearsed for opening night. Her husband, Major Brad Rose, was in Washington, where the Pentagon was under construction. Brad was with Army Air Force Information & Special Planning Division \\"ISPD\\". <br />Sgt. Eugene Struhbeck was a regular at the Canteen. Jenny dreaded seeing him because he had a huge chip on his shoulder and often picked fights. However, he was a decorated hero, of Midway, and had to be tolerated. He was often drunk and ended up shooting his mouth off about sensitive issues in the Air Force. Therefore, Lt. Malcolm Sandover was sent to keep an eye on him. Eugene was in love with \\"Dina\\", who had as little to do with him as possible. <br />Elise Ginsberg was a volunteer junior hostess. She was Jewish and the men in her home life had her out, almost all the time, trying to get some graphic photos published. The closest she got was to Ruth McGowan of Associated Press. Many had heard about the Nazis concentration camps, but no one spoke of them. <br />***** So much is going on in this story that I find it impossible to list it all. Therefore, I listed many of the characters, but not all, and just a tiny bit about each. <br />This is an incredibly fast paced story that readers will be hard pressed to stop, even temporarily, whenever reality intrudes. It is clear that the author spent much time on researching the era. There are several areas in the story where the author injected a bit of humor to help break some of the tension. <br />This story is an excellent work offiction combining facts of the war, the chaos civilians went through, and even some romance. (I kept comparing it to \\"The Sound of Music\\".) Highly recommended! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-02-12

She pits two strong-willed characters against each other and creates a very believable tale with them. This book is perfect for the Valentine's Day season.

The LAST person she expected to rescue her would be a mercenary named Gabriel Ross Sullivan! Chaz had been one of the Fleet's officers that often hunted his ship and caused him endless troubles. <br />Sully had rescued her for more than one reason. The only one he told her of, though, was his need for her knowledge of the system. Chaz had the inside information, know-how, and codes that was needed to complete his extremely dangerous mission. <br />Sully's other reason was personal. His feelings for her! However, Sully had a deep, dark secret. Anyone who found out, even his closest friends, would instantly loath him! To gain Chaz's heart he planned to keep his secret from her forever. Yet, little-by-little, Chaz saw pieces of what Sully tried to hide. Now he could only shield her as much as possible or pray for a miracle! <br />**** Wonderful story! There is a couple of times it slowed down too much for my personal taste, but not enough to ever dampen my interest. Everytime I thought I knew all of Sully's personal secret, I was proved wrong. <br />The author added spicy co-characters, a few of which are almost as fascinating as the main characters! In fact, it is so well written I could almost believe these characters existed out in space somewhere! Recommended! **** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-02-06

The story touches on a group of women, each going through a life crisis. The main character is Trudy Marino. She is 46 years-old and separated from, Rick, her husband of over 20 years. At the beginning of the book, Trudy's next door neighbor, Roberta Williams, has JUST become a widow. She had been with Edgar, her husband, for over 60 years. <br />Roberta's granddaughter, Jade, comes to help. Jade is going through her own male problems (with Dante) and takes up kick boxing to vent her frustrations. Though Trudy is the main character, Jade seemed to steal the spot light often. I looked forward to her chapters most. <br />The book is written in first person view and each chapter gives the name of the person whom the chapter represents. Sometimes the chapter is one of the other women in the group, but not often, such as Shannelle (another neighbor). But again I point out that Trudy, Jade, and often Roberta are the focus.<br />**** Now do not go thinking of the movie \\"First Wives Club\\", as I did, when you pick up this little gem. THIS tale is actually realistic! The author, Barbara Samuel, even included what looked like copies of emails sent to and fro the women. (I wonder if Hopefuls at yahoogroups.com is real. I will have to look that up. Hmmm...) <br />All-in-all, I found this to be a charming and modern day book with people that almost seemed real to me.

While digging up an area for a new shopping center near Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, the skeletal remains of a teen is found.

Detective Inspector Michelle Hart was given the case, being the &quot;new girl&quot; in the force. She was surprised when Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks showed up hoping to help. <br />Alan had known Graham as a kid and had last seen Graham the day before the disappearance. Alan had kept a secret all these years and the guilt forced him back from an extended vacation in hope of releaving his guilty conscience. Alan ended up disturbing things best left alone and put his life/sanity on the line. <br />*** This title is labeled as &quot;suspense&quot;, however, it takes over half the book before any suspense begins to build. Until then it is all mystery solving and D.I. Hart dealing with what appears to be another case (kidnapping).

Fans of Jane Austen's book, PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE, will adore this novel! The author, Carrie Bebris, used the characters from Austen's famous novel. <br />Elizabeth Bennet had become Elizabeth Darcy. She had a double wedding with her sister, Jane. However, Jane's husband had a jealous sister, Caroline Bingley, who did all she could to steal the spot light from the brides. This included announcing her engagement to a rich American named Frederick Parrish. <br />Shortly after Caroline's wedding, odd things began to happen, such as her horse suddenly bolted almost injuring Caroline. Of course, everyone was concerned! <br />Professor Randolph, in archeology, specialized in the culture of North America. He traveled with the Darcys to Netherfield. He took along some American artifacts that he claimed had special powers. Things got sort of eerie when one house guest was murdered and a sudden blizzard trapped everyone in the house. It was up to the Darcys to figure out who-dunnit. <br />***** Characters we already know and love are in a deadly mystery, possibly involving sorcery! Carrie Bebris has done a masterful job continuing Austen's characters. Even the flavor of writing seemed the same which shows true talent!

Kylara &quot;Ky&quot; Vatta was thrown out of the Academy for trusting the wrong person. She returned home, avoiding media, to regroup herself. Her father, Gerard Vatta of Vatta Transport, decided Ky needed to go away until the media circus calmed down a bit. So she was sent as captain to take an old space craft on its last journey, to Belinta first and then to the scrap yard. She had a very small crew, but they were all veterans of space. <br />At Belinta, Ky learned that the planet had ordered agriculture &quot;ag&quot; equipment over a year ago from Sabine Prime which was picked up by another transport company and never delivered. Belinta was desperate for the equipment. No one named Vatta had ever turned down a chance to profit and Ky was no different. Ky hoped to earn enough money so that her ship could be repaired instead of scrapped. Once the personal contract was signed, she was off to Sabine Prime.<br />Sabine Prime gave Captain Vatta a bit of trouble, but not much, at first. Ky needed a new FTL drive before she could go anywhere. It was a vital part of the ship. Then she needed to purchase the ag equipment. The problem was figuring out how to get the money. FTL drives were very expensive. It all became worse when chaos erupted. Someone blew up the ISC's ansible platforms, so communications was all but gone. Then war ships came in. Ky's ship had no weapons and, with no FTL drive, no way to leave. She and her crew were defenseless and in the middle of a war between Sabine Prime and mercs! <br />**** Very good beginning to what appears to be a series or trilogy. The plots are all tied up by the end, but many sub-plots are left dangling. I would very much like to find out how one or two of them end up, especially the one from the academy. <br />The beginning of the book reminded me a bit of the Honor Harrington series by David Weber. Young woman, military back ground, done horribly wrong, underestimated, and very cunning. Yet by the half way mark, Ky had definitely separated herself from Honor in my mind. Ky has her own way of dealing with things and any emotional trash is put on hold until the crisis is over. All-in-all, VERY GOOD novel. I hope the sequel comes out quickly. **** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-01-23

The huntress mother of Young Slasher knew very early that he would be special. The huntress went to &quot;Broken Spear, Esteemed Great Warrior of the Clan Rydderrak&quot; to ask for her son to be raised to Hunt Law. The old clan warrior agreed.<br />Young Slasher earned his new name, Renegade. Renegade would be trained to handle anything that any world could possibly throw at him. He and his two friends, Dasrylion and Rampage, would endure harsh training, severe survival tests, and (eventually) the most lethal trial of all - The Master Hunter. The last was solo. Each teen must endure the Master Hunt alone, knowing that many young hunters never returned from the ultimate hunt.<br />**** An interesting mix of primitive hunting/training and high-tech gadgets kept me guessing as to what would happen next. The author ended the novel in a way that it could be &quot;stand-alone&quot; OR someday have a sequel. The story left me with the wonderful feeling of victory for Renegade and hopeful for another adventure with him in the future! ****<br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-01-20

Surprise, surprise, when Long Ball appeared with a trade delegation from the People's Republic of China as Mr. Dong Ping (future Premier).<br />Jake had been in deep cover, ordered after he left Detachment X-Ray. He emerged and became Staff Assistant to a United States Senator, Sam Martin. Jake had been at a U.N. conference when he spied Long Ball. Jake was lucky enough to get the best secretary on the Hill and her big boyfriend was a small arms expert. Better yet, Jake struck gold when he hired a red haired Irish lass as his driver. She was THE BEST when tails from the FBI, CIA, and the Chinese Secret Service had to be shook off!<br />Jake, his new staff, and comrades from the Korean War got together to deal with a mountain feud, stop a drug running operation (via sea), and make plans for Long Ball.<br />**** Very few sequels to books and movies are as good as the original. Yet Jess Parker has succeeded in doing it here. It was fast paced and non-stop all the way through the novel with a climatic ending that left me laughing and begging for more! I can only hope the author is considering a third for Jake Green. I am so happy to be able to highly recommend this book, and its author, to everyone I meet! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2004-01-14

This is THE best book on the subject of Nuclear war and other major disasters I have ever read. Dr. Clayton walks you through everything nuclear, from effects of air bursts, ground bursts, EMP, to every other nuclear topic imaginable. While famous for its nuclear information, this book is writen as a primer to surviving ANY disaster. Our Motto here at Alpha Group is(as you know) &quot;It doesn't matter what causes the situation, you should be prepared to survive it&quot;. This book fits perfectly with that philosophy. <br />I consider this book one of the &quot;MUST HAVE&quot; books in any survival library. Not only does this book contain fantastic and interesting reading, but with its dozens of charts, lists, drawings and photos, this book serves as an excellent reference on surviving ANY major disaster. It is one of the few reference books I keep in my personal bookshelf beside the computer. When I read this book for the first time I was amazed by what I THOUGHT I knew. I was VERY wrong in many of my beliefs. Even the US government used Dr. Clayton's research to revise their policies in some areas. <br />Chapters covered include:<br />It's a disaster<br />Everything you ever wanted to know about nuclear war<br />To flee or not to flee<br />Home sweet hole<br />Nobody makes housecalls anymore<br />and MANY others that will keep you reading, and more importantly, will keep you alive no matter what the disaster.	2004-01-12

When gun shots erupted down the street from her home, Rhea grabbed her medical bag and sprinted to help. The chief coroner was shot during the episode and Rhea found herself, unwillingly, deputized as an assistant coroner. Just another item to pay back Mark Stafford, local law enforcer, for. And pay him back she would. In spades! <br />It was not long before a mass grave was uncovered. All were young girls, all high school ages, some black and some white, and all posed in the grave to make a message. It seemed the area had a serial killer on the loose and he had been killing for quite awhile. <br />***** Hmmm, seems Dr. Rhea-Rhea and Mark are going through a severe rough patch in romance. (This was a loose end from the last book.) Enter dangerous and sexy man Eli Cordell. This ex-military commando-man will give Mark a serious run for Rhea's affection. This novel has more action, adventure, and romance than the predecessors. So hold onto your seat. <br />There are a couple of sub-plots around the young girls and Marisa that I do not mention for fear of spoiling something. All-in-all, this medical/police thriller is well worth the price.

One of the suspects is known to dine very often in the restaurant called Mama Sophia's. That is where Nick's idea to hire a bodyguard comes in. <br />Mia DeNero has just opened The Guardian Angel for business. She is officially, on paper at least, a trained bodyguard. However, being such a petite lady, it is hard to believe Mia could be anyone's protector. She is getting desperate for business when Nick walks in her office door. To protect Nick from the mob, she must be near him constantly. So Nick moves into her little apartment, located above Mama Sophia's. <br />**** Mia knows little about being a bodyguard. Nick knows little about dealing with a spitfire who is determined to protect him. It all adds up to fun and mayhem. Mia's family is huge and loaded with colorful characters that will tickle your fancy. <br />The only real draw back I found was that it took almost one hundred pages before I ever met the real bad guys. During this time though, I was treated to Mia's extended family. If you have read Millie Criswell's previous books, then you will see many cameos of those past characters, and find out how they are fairing.

Claire was eventually found, but she had been changed forever. Now Erin may have a chance to finally catch the man responsible. He was known as The Magician. <br />Alec Donovan is an FBI agent on the hunt for a missing child. His record for locating missing children is high. His hunches are almost legendary! Erin is positive that the person who recently kidnapped the boy Alec is searching for, is the same one who took Claire all those years ago. On a hunch, Alec agrees. The two begin an investigation that digs up horrors, committed by untouchable people in very high places. <br />**** This one will keep you turning the pages at the speed of light. It is an intense plot that is all too real. <br />Much like Patricia Cornwell, this author seems to be creating a realistic hero and heroine in which the reader can grow attached to and look forward to seeing in future books together. These main characters are attracted to one another, but their romance will grow slowly and fans may watch as it blooms. I find myself eagerly awaiting the next release involving Erin and Alec! **** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2003-12-30

She lives in a small town in Missouri with \\"Mamma\\", her older brother who is just hitting puberty, Will, and Cynthia who is the eldest at twenty. Sis is the narrator of the story and is basically left in the dark during the entire story. She has no idea why Mamma goes into dark funks and rages. She has no idea that all the vengeful schemes Mamma does and involves her children in is abnormal. However, the whole town knows that Mamma has a mental disorder but never does anything about it to help the kids. The year is 1970 for the tale, which explains things a bit since little was known about Mamma's illness, Bipolar Disorder back then. <br />** Be warned that you, as the reader, may be offended at some of the sexual content. Sis is involved in a bit with Cynthia at one point. Had I known about it, I would not have read the book. So consider yourself forewarned! Be aware that there is A LOT of cursing. (Much more so than I, as a bipolar, and the bipolars I know of ever do.) The author gave me the impression that this is a poor, trashy family. <br />The writing is flawless, but the way Sis describes things confused me at points. However, I was able to eventually figure out what was meant. It just took a few scenes for the images to solidify in my mind. All in all, this is tale is too complicated, leaving me confused and often thinking about just quitting. If you are just looking for symptoms of bipolars, this book will definitely show them to you.

But for a companion to even think of changing things is like an act of treason, with a high punishment. Even so, there are a few brave ones. They have an elite chat room where they secretly speak with each other and plan what they will do differently once they have grown fangs. None of them knows the real names of the others or where they reside. The ID of each is gender-less. No one speaks of what they do for a living.

Charlotte &quot;Char&quot; McCairn was new to being an Enforcer. While at Starbucks Char heard the dhamphir inform her of her first mission. The Council had decided to kill a vampire hunter named Jebel Haven. Char was chosen to do the deed. Shortly afterward, a nest leader (Helene Bourbon) asked Char to help locate one of her younger vampires named Daniel. Char decided to search for Daniel first. <br />Jebel Haven was searching for a missing teenager who may have been abducted by vampires. Since Char and Jebel both searched for the same teen, they reluctantly joined forces. Neither were totally honest with the other and both had deadly plans for the other once Daniel was located. <br />A dark cult had formed in the streets of Seattle. Getting to Daniel was much harder than they believed it would be. The cult had Daniel. The main cult leaders were a sorcerer and a demon. The sorcerer would be no trouble; however, a demon was a child of a lower god. One Law of the Blood read &quot;It is death to any vampire who interferes in the affairs of the children of the lower gods.&quot; <br />** Unlike the first of this series, I found the second difficult to get into. The first half was so slow and the scenes were scattered and choppy. Yet the second half was non-stop action. <br />By the time I found this series, books 1 - 5 were already published. By reading the back covers I learned that each book was a different city and a different Enforcer. Char and her companion will return in book five. Therefore, I must guess that these main characters will interact with each other some time in the future. You CAN skip book two, but if you intend to read the whole series DO NOT skip it. This book will explain Char and Jebel. Since they WILL be returning in future book(s), this one is worth your time to pick up.

Rosebank had once been a magnificent plantation on the banks of Bayou Teche. Guy had decorated Rosebank with hundreds of monkeys and pineapples. <br />When David's wife, Charlotte, and daughter, Vivian, learned that the family finances were poor, they decided to make Rosebank prosper. With Vivian's degree in hotel management and charlotte's restaurant expertise, they would slowly turn Rosebank into a resort hotel. <br />Their dream began to crumble when the family lawyer was murdered on Rosebank's grounds. He had been coming with big news for Charlotte and Vivian only to be killed within walking distance of the estate. The envelope containing the wonderful news had vanished, leaving the Patins clueless as to what it had contained. <br />Unsatisfied with the laughable investigation by the local police (Errol Bonine), Vivian turned to Spike Devol, the deputy sheriff of a nearby town. Not only was Spike known to be smart and wily, not to mention sexy, but he had also been present when Vivian stumbled upon the first body (her lawyer). Spike and Errol are totally different and tempers toward each other run hot. However, Spike's growing attraction to Vivian will not let him back off from investigating on his own. <br />***** Author Stella Cameron has written another winner, in my opinion.

Lucinda Fairfax's father had left her and her mother when she was only five years old, to return to Yorkshire and claim his title and estate. At age twenty-five and with her mother deceased, Lucinda traveled to Yorkshire. Her father, Viscount Westcombe, had died in an accident and Lucinda was the heir. <br />Here she would meet the famous &quot;Devil Duke&quot; named Gideon Blackthorne. Right away sparks would fly and a haunting obsession would begin. And Death would stalk the night. <br />***** This is the first in a new Gothic line from Love Spell! Mary Stewart and Victoria Holt fans, take heed! An excellent choice to show the world that Gothics are back! Dark, mysterious, just a touch of the supernatural, and some steamy romance. No one can tell a story like Evelyn Rogers! And I believe Gothics are right up her alley! Pre-order if you are able, to ensure that you do not miss out!

Because Susan Grant has created an amazing universe with some very interesting characters to turn it upside-down! The story was well written and very believable.

Often the misty form of a young woman walking on the beach appeared. Yet no one else could see or hear the ghost. Worse, the ghost was NOT exactly friendly or harmless! <br />***** W-O-W! Gothic Lovers, do NOT miss this one! Author Evelyn Rogers has proven herself to be The QUEEN of Gothic Romance! This is an incredible tale that I found myself unable to put down.

Humans have police to uphold their laws. Vampires have &quot;Enforcers&quot;. <br />Enforcers are an elite group of vampires. Selim is the Enforcer in Los Angeles. Much time has passed since the vampires in the city last tasted fresh human blood. A hunt is needed ... and soon. As Enforcer, it is up to Selim to name the time, the place, and the prey.<br />Because ONLY Enforcers kill other vampires, Selim's job does not make him popular. He can never waver or show any weakness whenever he gives the Laws. To do so could easily cost him his life and the life of his mortal love/companion Siri.<br />**** A very solid beginning for this series! When an Enforcer must go hunt another of his kind, one of them WILL die. It looks as though this will happen at least once in each of the books in the series. <br />This series is NOT for readers who want a vampire like the one Stoker created, nor for the ladies wanting a vampire hero to dream about. You should ONLY consider this book if you like the idea of vampires living among us in the world today, in clans. Recommended reading.

Readers find much satisfaction!<br />Readers will also be excited to see all that happens to the Peeps and the manipulative bas...uh, citizens who govern them. There are not as many battle scenes as in previous books, but let's face it, Honor is coming back as medical mess and healing takes awhile. But just because she is only involved in one actual space battle, does not mean you won't see the Manicorian and Grayson Navy kick some serious butt!<br />All-in-all, another winner by David Weber!	2003-12-10

The planet of Klairn is an amazing planet where the natural resources are watched over by the Protectors. If you read the first book in the series, then you understand the harsh trials each person goes through in the slim hope of becoming a Protector. Only the best of the best make it. The main characters from the previous novel return. The book is their first official mission. <br />Iona is sent out with two other male agents, Enoki and Drake, on Boat Number Four for an espionage mission. Iona poses as the wife to each man as the mission progresses. <br />Joby the Black and Lexti are paired as field researchers. Since they do well at mind-linking with animals and trees, the two men must earn the trust of the more dangerous animals as they attempt to persuade the animals in cooperating and giving &quot;samples&quot;. <br />Shalmina is one of the best spies. She goes undercover as a secretary of the advertising department of Magusa Petroleum Products. Magusa is the company believed to be guilty (even if indirectly) of polluting the river. <br />***** This novel is, in my opinion, even better than the first! The trees and wildlife can actually communicate with Protectors. In fact, they have even learned to speak a few words to help the process of communications along. <br />You do not HAVE to read the first book to understand everything that is going on, but you will have a much better time understanding the romantic sub-plots. All-in-all, this is one spectacular series that I highly recommend to all fans of Science Fiction! *****	2003-12-04

Widow Jeanette LaFleur and her young daughter, Brigitte, resided in New Orleans. Jeanette graduated (high in her class) and was qualified as an ophthalmic technologist. She began her dream job as Clinical Coordinator for Dr. Byron Rutherford's Epi Study (A.K.A. Living Lens Project). Upon discovering several problems in record keeping, Jeanette shrugged it off to lack of organization skills from her predecessors. But when she found out several records were either missing or never existed, she went to Dr. Rutherford. He, also, shrugged it off and told Jeanette that he had complete confidence that she could fix the problems. Jeanette dug more and kept finding problems with no answers. As puzzle pieces began to click into place, Jeanette found herself believing the project to be a front for several illegal activities. <br />With the help of her current boyfriend, lawyer Charles Carter, and her deceased husband's best friend, Dr. Scott Fontenot, Jeanette put together enough evidence for fraud and medical negligence. But when the trio began finding illegal body parts, and not JUST the corneas needed for the project, their lives were at stake! <br />***** Here is a medical and legal thriller combination that, in my opinion, is right up there with novels written by author John Grisham! I simply can not describe how much I enjoyed this story. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It is very well written, fast paced, and the characters seem very realistic. <br />To know that it is based on a similar 1980's lens project, even though this is still labeled as a fictional novel, makes it hit home on an even deeper level.

When her husband died VERY shortly after the vows had been said, the minor scandal became a blaze of gossip. Even months later, only Cassandra would visit. The rest of the Effingtons ignored her.<br />Viscount Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; St. Stephens was an agent of the British government. Disguised as Gordon, an elderly butler, he had been planted in Delia's house to protect her. In fact, all the &quot;servants&quot; were agents. Delia never knew that her late husband had been an agent ... or that an enemy spy had murdered him. However, the chances were high that Delia was in danger. Yet as &quot;Gordon&quot; befriended her, &quot;Tony&quot; fell in love with her.

Set mostly in the year of 1870, Bounty Hunter Ryder Storm was hired by Adelaine Montgomery to hunt down Cheryl Donovan. Adelaine accused Cheryl of murdering her husband, Charles Montogomery, three months ago.<br />It took Ryder four months to locate her. Cheryl had changed her name. She went by the name of Cheri Henderson and had a two year old son, Joey. Ironically, she lived with his own good friends, the McGregor Family. After only six months in Tucson, Arizona, all the McGregor's considered Cheri and Joey to be part of the family. They all knew the truth about Cheri being raped years ago and Joey being the result. They were the only ones who knew and did not care. Cheri loved her son, Joey, and so did all the members of the McGregor household. <br />Cheri worked as a waitress in Charlie's Saloon, but that was ALL she did. The other women took &quot;clients&quot; upstairs for extra pay, but never Cheri. After being harmed by one man, Cheri knew that she would never be able to stand the touch of a man again. &quot;Bas&quot; McGregor escorted her safely home each night, just in case any men tried anything funny to the woman he cared so much about. <br />All the McGregors knew Ryder was in town on business. They did not know who Ryder was after, but they were glad to see him whenever he was in the area. Ryder and Cheri clashed on first sight. But since they both loved the large family, they were as civil to each other as possible. It was an attraction to each other that caused the clashing. It was that attraction that kept Ryder from just taking Cheri back to face the widow. The more he learned, the more Ryder doubted that Cheri killed Charles Montogomery. <br />***** I seldom read a historical romance this good. (The only thing wrong with this story is the cover of the novel. The heroine on the cover does not match the description of Cheri in the book.) Once I began this story, I simply could NOT put it down. So I read the entire story in one sitting. It is THAT wonderful! Now I can only hope that Adelaine's daughter has her story told next. Highly recommended reading! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch.	2003-11-27

All their females were useless. When the men learned that the females from Terra could be impregnated by their race, they created Retrieval Units to abduct them. <br />Of all the warriors in the Empire, the ones known as Reapers were most feared. They were the elite, feared by men and women alike. Trained from birth to hunt and kill, then altered at the age of ten for other special talents, Reapers knew no fear and no love. Prime Reaper Captain Kamerone Cree was the best of them all. The Fleet called him &quot;the Iceman&quot;. <br />The Resistance had noticed Cree's looks toward Dr. Bridget Dunne. With careful planning the Resistance had Cree taken to Behavioral Modification (Be-Mod 9) for &quot;punishment&quot;. Unknown to the Empire, the doctors of Be-Mod 9 were really re-programming the Prime Reaper. <br />That was easier said than done, for Reapers were what Terra called Vampires. A bloodbeast lived within each Reaper. They were usually merciless warriors with a high pain tolerance, but whenever one entered into Transition the beast took over. The Resistance chose Bridget as his mate. Cree and Bridget would be used to change the Empire, whether they liked it or not! <br />***** A lot of torture takes place within this book.

In 1984 men were drafted into the Soviet Army at the age of eighteen. There was no choice. Unless you were in college or disabled, you served. Many men broke their legs to avoid serving. Others, the more wealthy, bribed their way out. Vlad was in college two years when the law changed and he was off to boot camp. Training the men needed, they never received. Training the men did NOT need, they got. (For example, lots of time was spent learning to parachute, even though it was a well known fact that no one used parachutes in Afghanistan.) <br />Vlad was born January 12, 1965. His &quot;Date of Military Service Application&quot; was April 26, 1984. This memoir really began when an officer walked up to Vlad at a distribution center and asked, &quot;Do you want to serve in the commandos, the Blue Berets?&quot; Vlad kept a tiny calendar where he crossed off his six hundred and twenty-one days, one-at-a-time. Vlad kept detailed records of each mission he participated in. He had his own little code, shown in this memoir. Two hundred and seventeen of those days were spent on combat missions. In addition to Vlad's coded diary, he secretly took many photographs. This book has dozens of the pictures littered throughout, and makes a powerful impact on those who read it. <br />***** Vlad, a minesweeper, portrays the horrors of war in vivid details.

Texas police officer Dave DeMarco and his brothers had been in a bar when news of a plane crash in Mexico came on the television. Dave was stunned to see the pilot was Lisa Morrison. Lisa had been a former high school bad girl. In fact, he felt guilty about something from those long ago days and had told Lisa that if she ever needed anything, call him!<br />The news reported Lisa had died in the crash. Imagine Dave's surprise when Lisa called him that night from Mexico with a wild tale of drug smuggling, her plane being sabotaged, and everyone (including the local Mexican law) trying to kill her! Dave thought Lisa was delusional from the crash. But a promise was a promise, so he was off to Mexico. Turned out Lisa was completely sane and now everyone wants them BOTH dead.<br />**** This one is a fast paced adventure with a lot of hot love scenes. It is spicier than hot tamales and packed full of danger and intrigue. Well written and with secondary characters that you can not help but care for. Author Jane Graves has another winner with one. ****	2003-11-04

Baxter's city council voted to let Thompson Tire Corporation build a plant in town. Most of the residents were glad about it. Some were not. <br />Sheila Paxton was the company's lawyer. Sheila made a move on Charlie Kirby, Baxter's mayor, even though she knew he was happily married and had seven kids. Charlie seriously considered it, was very tempted, and refused the offer. When Sheila suddenly died, dark rumors spread of an affair between Charlie and Sheila. Charlie's marriage became threatened and the small town was heavy with gossip. <br />Worse, Sheila was part of the Witness Protection Program. A killer from her past was interested in finding her parents. Since Sheila (a.k.a. Mary Angelina Risotto) died in Baxter, that was where he went. The lives of Charlie and Ellen Jones, the editor of the town's paper, were about to become nightmares! <br />***** This is the last book in the Baxter series. I did not read the first four, but it does not matter. The story was able to stand alone. I was never confused or felt that I was missing anything. I love books of a series that manage to please no matter in what order they are read.<br />The story is filled with the warmth of a small town where everyone knows each other. That could be a good thing! However, the author shows that there are times that it could be a problem as well. There is a lot of suspense with all the mob, FBI, and local police involvement. The story also focuses on family matters, as well as, their faith in God. A wonderful story that will keep you hooked! Recommended! *****	2003-11-03

Her doctor gave her until September to live. When her fiancé found out, he lost all interest in her. Instead of waiting for death to claim her, Claire decided to make the most of her remaining time. First, she dumped the fiancé. Second, she went to her work place with big ideas. Claire was a journalist for Harper's Publishing. She was determined to travel into the Wild West and send back articles. Her family understood how important this was to Claire. They wrote to Uncle Ben and asked for an escort.<br />Ben Holladay owned a successful stage route in the Colorado territory. He loved Claire dearly and sent his best gun man, Billy West, to pick her up and bring her to him. No one outside the family was to know of her condition. She wanted no pity. Therefore, Billy had no clue that the Grim Reaper was patiently waiting behind Claire's lovely back. He was too busy anyway. He had to keep Claire out of danger, her long-eared dog out of the way, and her brassy Aunt Ute somewhat satisfied over Claire's treatment. Billy also picked up an orphan boy named Willie that he was bringing along to meet his adopted family (from the previous book, &quot;Dance On The Wind&quot;). <br />The LAST thing Billy wanted was to fall in love. The LAST thing Claire wanted was for Billy to learn that her death was imminent. Claire only had &quot;Until September&quot; ... <br />***** WOW! All through the book I kept thinking to myself that the diagnosis had to be wrong. No author in her right mind would do this to the heroine of the story! But I had forgotten the fact that Brenda K. Jernigan is one wily author. This is one writer who could take the impossible and make it possible! <br />So how does it turn out? Is the diagnosis correct? Will Claire live until September? Well, you will just have to read the story to find out. <br />This is an amazing glimpse into America's past. The author added bits of history, such as a cameo by John Roebling as he began showing his plans on building the Brooklyn Bridge to possible financiers and by Wild Bill Hickok. Do I recommend this story? OH, YES! *****	2003-11-03

She still graduated as Sharpshooter A-1 and was determined to become an excellent T-FLAC, antiterrorist agency, operative.<br />Kane Wright was a master of disguise and a legend among the agents. He wanted a seasoned sharpshooter agent to help his team take out a known, class-one terrorist named Fazur Raazaq. Since none were available, T-FLAC sent in A.J. It would take everything Kane had to hide his attraction from her.<br />When Intel confirmed that Raazaq had in his possession a &quot;category four&quot; viral agent, the assassination was to be delayed until A.J. and Kane could locate the highly contagious viral agent, BEFORE it was used!<br />***** In a word, &quot;W-O-W-!&quot; Author Cherry Adair has created a wild, fly-by-the-seat-of-their-pants, action filled modern contemporary that will hook readers on page one and never let go!

During the first two books (MARCH UPCOUNTRY &amp; MARCH TO THE SEA) spoiled Prince Roger transformed into a warrior. At the beginning of book three, Prince Roger Ramius Sergei Alexander Chiang MacClintock and his Marines have begun crossing a treacherous sea on the planet Marduk. <br />Many native Mardukan characters from the previous books had joined the Royal Marines. The Empire thought them all long dead. However, Roger's troop had to somehow get off the hot and boggy planet they had wrecked on before they could let the Empire know otherwise. <br />After six long months of marches and too many battles to recall, they were finally nearing the small and secluded space port which was their destination. Information made the port seem to be hostile instead of friendly, but since nothing had been easy up until now, the information did not come as a big surprise. The hostiles would just have to learn the old truism: You DON'T mess with a MacClintock. <br />***** Okay, I do not think it is a spoiler to tell you this much: There is going to be a fourth book. There HAS to be. By the time you are half way into the book you just KNOW that there is no way all this can be done in one book. The authors added a few new twists to ensure the necessity of another book. Personally, I believe this series is the best, with only the Honor Harrington series being better. There is just too much time in between each of these books though. <br />If you are just researching and have not read the first two books as yet, then do not bother to begin reading the series until after the next book comes out. You must read all the books, in order, to understand the major characters, as well as what is going on. <br />Each book left me begging for more and this one is no exception. This is an awesome series with two well known and brilliant authors creating spectacular characters and places for readers to lose themselves in. Highly recommended book. Part of a highly recommended series. *****	2003-10-23

The latest installment of Honor Harrington has hit the shelves for all of us who are addicted! Much of the book has to do with politics, the healing of Nimitz and Honor, and Honor having to deal with all the problems of coming back from the dead. She finds much embarrassing. Readers find much satisfaction! <br />Readers will also be excited to see all that happens to the Peeps and the manipulative bas...uh, citizens who govern them. There are not as many battle scenes as in previous books, but let's face it, Honor is coming back as medical mess and healing takes awhile. But just because she is only involved in one actual space battle, does not mean you won't see the Manicorian and Grayson Navy kick some serious ...! <br />All-in-all, another winner by David Weber!	2003-10-23

The Marines, with a bunch of new recruits, continue their march to the sea in hopes of purchasing ship transportation across the monster filled ocean. <br />Getting to the city near the coast was as hard as getting transport. Of course, battles for both had to be fought and won. But with each battle the challenges get harder. Ammo was not unlimited and few of the original Marines were left. <br />A bit of romance was thrown in for the fast maturing prince. And the readers get a few surprises thrown at them! <br />***** Not as many battles as the first book in the trilogy, but just as great! I do not know which author subtly alluded to the &quot;Nancy Bell&quot; poem near the ending, but it was done so smoothly that I can not help but wonder how many people noticed it. This is the best Sci-Fi series I have read all year! I am eagerly awaiting the third book. Highly recommended! *****	2003-10-23

A team was quickly assembled to go down to Deepsix and recover all they could for later examinations before the doomed planet ripped apart. <br />Priscilla Hutchins was an archeologist of ancient alien artifacts and part of the team. Another member was Randall Nightingale, who was the commander of an ill-fated team that had tried to explore the planet before and knew the dangerous wildlife. <br />An earthquake destroyed the crafts that they used to reach the planet. The world was becoming more and more unstable. The team was left with 240 hours to trek across a dangerous land in hope of finding a spacecraft Randall's team had left there 20 years before! <br />**** I found this book to be very fast paced and full of excitement!

Captain Tasha &quot;Sass&quot; Sebastian had many secrets in her past. And that was where she wished them to remain! Her best friend just happened to be the ship's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Eden Flynn. Stories abounded about the trouble the often found themselves, as well as, the unique ways they got out. Eden was an emplath with telepathic abilities which greatly helped her in her profession. <br />Admiral Branden Kel-Paten was referred to as the Tin Soldier. As a teen he had become bio-cybernetic, more computer than human. He was not supposed to feel emotions. So if anyone found out how he felt about Sass, he would be in for a &quot;Section Forty-Six.&quot; <br />After surviving a vortex, they picked up the human pirate Jace Serafino, who was a rogue telepath with a deadly brain implant. Jace and Paten had known each other before. Neither like the other. However, after being attacked by Illithian fighters, they were thrown into an unknown section of space where they must put aside their differences if they intended to survive! <br />***** A remarkable piece of work! Sass and Eden each have a pet that resembles a cat with telepathy and intelligence. I especially loved those two fury creatures! Each character has their own quirks and personalities, that readers can easily come to care for. The only problem I have found with author Linnea Sinclair is that she cannot write fast enough for me.

He had several best-selling novels under his belt, had done several TV, radio, and magazine interviews, and had friends in high places. His life changed when he was told his brother, Mark, and his new sister-in-law, Cheryl, had died during a car wreck. Knowing it could not have been suicide or drunk driving, Himmler did his own information research. Mark's last few moments of life had been recorded on a cassette. They had been following a huge flying craft, alien in nature. The echos of their screams sent Himmler out for revenge.<br />Himmler began \\"Operation AC/DC\\", Assassinate Crew - Disable Craft. From there, Himmler called in some contacts and assembled a team. Body count of the human and non-human types escalated. Secrets went so deep that even the U.S. President had been in the dark until some very special agents briefed him.<br />People around Himmler ended up dead, but all believed that Himmler's War was vital to the entire world. Himmler was about to face the best of the military and the aliens themselves!<br />***** W - O - W ! That says it all. Himmler's goes all out in this war. His arsenal contains most everything that begins with the letter \\"M\\", M-79 \\"Bloop gun\\", MK1, M26, MAC-10 \\"the Ingram\\", M15, AN-M8 SMOKE HC, LAW rockets ... just to name a few!

His older brother, Prince John, was Heir Apparent and already a galaxy renowned diplomat. His sister, Princess Alexandra, would be one of the best Fleet admirals even if she did not have her family connections. But Prince Roger showed no interest in anything except hunting big game and dressing well. <br />Alexandra VII, Empress of Man, was determined to keep her youngest son out of direct danger. Therefore, she sent Roger to a remote planet named Leviathan as a show of imperial support. The Bronze Battalion was to transport and guard the prince during it all. <br />While en route, the military ship was sabotaged and then was under enemy attack. Very few survived and were stranded on the planet Marduk. The Marines would have to trek half way around the globe in hope of commandeering an imperial ship for a return to Earth. However, the natives were NOT friendly! Even the local fauna would try to eat anything that moved! The heat and almost constant rain made things worse. Prince Roger would just have to get over himself and grow up FAST! <br />***** First off, ignore the awful cover art, I don't believe it is the fault of the authors. No, the female Marine is NOT ballet dancing. No, Prince Roger does NOT look that way. In fact, the prince has very long, blond hair that any woman would envy. One Marine referred to it as &quot;the hair of Lady Godiva.&quot; <br />Other than the cover art, the book is beyond excellent! The story is VERY well written, realistic, has a touch of humor, and the Marines can really kick BUTT! The prince matures steadily and even becomes an asset to the team! He also has the most awesome assassin program in his &quot;toot&quot;. All-in-all, this is highly recommended reading! *****	2003-10-23

But my vanity makes me like Petra the most. After all, change the P in her name to D and you have MY name! But more than that, I enjoyed watching her (as a 14 year old) using logic against grown men who trained in psychiatry. Petra has a way of seeing things more clearly than most.

He had left her mother before she was born. Kelyn cared nothing for the Wolverine or his legends. She wanted nothing to do with him. She grew up in the mountains of Ketura learning to survive, like her father before her as her mother wished. She had to practice much harder than the others of the village due to her occasional bouts of clumsiness. Where others did things gracefully, she was awkward. Where others learned quickly, she had to practice often and thoroughly.<br />When her mother died, the village witch told her that she must find her father if she wanted to find herself. So she began her journey. Kelyn did not wait for trouble to find her. She followed trouble to find the Wolverine. Once found, a battle of witches, barbarians, and sorcery began! Kelyn also found out WHY she was often clumsy. However, she could not understand why that clumsiness vanished at times of danger and battle. One thing was for certain, the Wolverine could not deny she was his daughter and he had definitely met his match!<br />*** Excellent! Like watching Xena and Hercules side-by-side!

No one was allowed to share their knowledge or spells with another. Then it was all joined together and hidden in a safe place, under guard. It became known as The Chaos Scroll. It was the only known protection against Var. Master Elzabar was a powerful Seer. He had a vision and a prophecy was made!<br />Var had learned the secret for eternal life. After four hundred years, most of the Seers were dead, and Var returned to Poppan Valley for revenge! He began by kidnaping Briana, a married woman whom he coveted. Her husband was Zernue, the Keeper of the Valley. Their children would embark on a dangerous journey for help against Var and the dark riders.

We continue where Diplomacy of Wolves cut us off so abruptly. Danya birthed Solander, the Reborn. She still dreamed of revenge against Crispin, Anwyn, and Andrew Sabir, as well as, against her own House. <br />Ry caught up with Kait and they began their wary dance. In the first book we found out Kait could skinshift to wolf or fish form. Book two showed another form that she and Ry could do. Dughall showed Ry what they were truly fighting for. In doing so, Ry's whole outlook on life changed, along with his priorities. They all join forces. <br />The Dragons were released from the Veil and possessed the bodies of powerful people. Through their dark magic Calimeeka's fate was sealed. Using the lives and souls of those who dwelled within the city as fuel, a new city emerged. It would not be long before the Dragons would turn their sights beyond the city to the rest of the world. <br />Luercas remained a curious puzzle in the first book. In this one we learned why he was helping Danya. I can say no more on that without giving away too much. <br />**** I thought this one to be as awesome as the last! However, again, the reader is left hanging in the middle of a vital second. Consider yourself warned that even though this author is fantastic, it is best NOT to begin reading this trilogy until all three books are released! Unless you have all three before you begin, you will not be satisfied and will probably end up angry. If you purchase all three at once and go from one straight into the next, you are in for a treat! The author weaves a fabulous tapestry of magic that will leave you breathless! ****	2003-10-23

The Queen of Chaldor foresaw the death of her husband in battle. Aided by an evil Vachyn sorcerer, Talon would conquer the castle. She gave the region's fiercest warrior, Gailard (a Highlander), the task of spiriting Princess Ellyn away and guarding her with his life until such time Ellyn was old enough to gain her hereditary powers, defeat Talon, and regain the throne.<br />Gailard and Ellyn had no love for each other. With Ellyn at the awkward age between child and woman, she had no understanding of the burdens of commanding armies, politics, magic, and zero patience. They gain an unlikely ally in Shara, another Vachyn. Shara promises to teach Ellyn the magic while Gailard teaches the princess how to battle in combat. Then, somehow, they must raise an army, defeat the mighty sorcerer, kill Talon, and regain the kingdom.<br />It sounded like fun!<br />***** An excellent Fantasy book! This one will keep its readers up well into the night. Non-stop, I hardly had time to breathe, much less, do anything in reality. Order out for pizza and settle in for a fantastic tale! *****	2003-10-23

The Authority called it &quot;The Diversity Crisis&quot;. Only one planet remained untouched, Pandora. The Pandorans were isolated from the Authority and kept close to nature. No machines, no medicines, only &quot;Guardians&quot;. The Authority was desperate and gave Pandora an ultimatum: Help find a cure or be destroyed. <br />There was no need for prisons. Anyone who broke the law forfeited their body right. That meant The Hothouses took them for experimenting on to find a cure. The Eden Project was a theory of creating a fetus with a high immune system that would not turn against the body of the mother hosting it. Of course, this meant only certain females were compatible. Luckily, the closest genetically perfect hosts, one family, left the Athena Station and settled on Pandora. They were (single parent) Helice Trust, and her young daughters, Chena and Teal. If they refused to volunteer for the Hothouse, they were to be forced. <br />Pandora was ruled by governments called &quot;Family&quot;. Each colony (complex) had a Family. Each member of the Family had a &quot;Conscience&quot; which was a chip that strongly persuaded the member to do what was considered right. Each complex had a &quot;City-Mind&quot;, an artificially created (but living) intelligence that WAS the complex, itself. Aleph was the city-mind for the Alpha Complex, where the story took place. She kept in touch with all the other city-minds. The city-minds took care of the Families, who in turn, took care of the villages in the colony. However, someone had been making covert alterations to Aleph without her knowledge. Someone who was out to force the Trust women into the Eden Project. Someone who altered nature's insects to kill any invaders the Authority may send. <br />***** This is the story of Helice, Chena, and Teal Trust. The story covers a ten year span, after all it deals with genetics. It is so well written that it was surreal! I found myself fully engrossed in the story and detested any time I had to stop reading. Highly recommended! *****	2003-10-23

In this novel the author, Orson Scott Card, focuses on secondary characters from ENDER'S GAME. <br />Peter Wiggin (a.k.a. the Hegemon, among other alias names), Julian Delphiki (a.k.a. \\"Bean\\"), and Petra Arkanian must deal with Achilles de Flandres. Achilles, if you recall from the previous books, was a genius. Mentally, however, he was very unstable. He wanted nothing more than the deaths of Peter, Bean, and Petra. Second on Achilles's list of things-to-do was to conquer all, starting with the Hegemony! <br />Suriyawong, Virlomi, Hyrum Graff, and Volescu appear as secondary characters. They were not just for show or used as \\"fillers\\" though. Each had vital roles in the book and possibly in the next. (My hope springs eternal.) <br />***** If you have not read the previous books, I highly recommend that you begin at the beginning, with ENDER'S GAME. Not only because all in this series is fantastic, but also because you when previous characters or events are mentioned, you would totally understand the reference and feel more a part of Card's vast universe. This author does not insult the intelligence of his readers; therefore, he will not go into deep detail on past events. He just mentions a person or event and carries on with the current story. I love that in an author! <br />Orson Scott Card made a fan of me with ENDER'S GAME. Of course, since I enjoyed it so much, I handed it over to my husband and the \\"Ender's Bug\\" (as I call it) bit him too. Card quickly made his way from my list of \\"Good Authors\\", to my list of \\"Favorite Authors\\", and currently resides on my \\"Elite List\\" which contains only four names (and one of them are deceased). I tell you that so you may understand that I do NOT consider myself to be overly dramatic when I say, \\"If you love Sci-Fi, you MUST read this series!\\" <br />Orson Scott Card rules the Sci-Fi universe! *****	2003-10-23

The Star Kingdom of Manticore and the Republic of Haven (formally known as \\"the Peeps\\") were still under a cease-fire. Technically, they were still at war since neither side had agreed on terms or signed a treaty. <br />Baron High Ridge and his allies wanted to reduce the influence of (Duchess) Honor Harrington and (Earl) Hamish White Haven to the public. Stefan Young held much hatred toward the woman who had killed his older brother, Pavel. His wife, Georgia, was an astute tactician and strategist. With her help, Stefan introduced a smear campaign to High Ridge that would not only reduce the influence of Honor and Hamish, but also harm the two emotionally. <br />Here I skip ahead. I want to give no spoilers. <br />Honor accepted a commission to the Sidemore Station in the Silesian territory. Pirates had always been a problem and slave trading had begun to pick up. The Andermani Empire interferes often. However, it was the Republic causing the major trouble. Operation Bolthole was nearing completion. The Republic had advanced greatly in many areas. They now had LACs that used \\"the Triple Ripple\\" as a way around the technical competence of the Star Kingdom. While High Ridge had been making cuts, retiring important leaders, and downsizing ships and personnel, the Republic had been secretly building CLACs, upgrading their technology, and making war plans. <br />Add a newly discovered seventh terminus to the Junction and negotiations seem to become worse. Tempers run high and Honor was in the center of everything, as usual. <br />***** Author David Weber spends more time on Honor Harrington and her personal life this time around. Politics and war strategies are just as strong as ever, however, I feel as though I understand Honor just a little better. Of course Nimitz and Samantha are there. In fact, Weber tossed in a surprise or two pertaining to them as well. Nimitz seems to have more of a personality this time around too. <br />BRAVO, David Weber! A job WELL DONE!

Even those who looked Human, were partly something else. All True Humans lived secluded on Luna. On Luna, males far outnumbered the females. Female children were highly prized by their families. About half the pregnancies were &quot;culls&quot;, babies that did not look human, and were aborted before the mothers reached the full term of their pregnancies. <br />One man left Luna to work for the Protectorate Defense Forces (PDF). He was Rik Boehmer. His wife, Salla, and two daughters lived on Luna with the rest of his family line. He returned home from a mission to find himself caught between his duty as a Protectorate Defender and his family on Luna. Luna planned to take back Terra for True Humans, even if it meant killing all the humanoid life that currently called Terra &quot;Home&quot;. <br />***** There is A LOT MORE happening in this book than I detail hee. I dare not reveal more, though, for fear of ruining the story. I read the book in one sitting, unable to bring myself to a halt. I had to know what happened next! Nina M.

A young diplomat named Kait Galweigh uncovered a Sabir plot to ambush the entire House Galweigh during the wedding ceremony. She dared not tell how she discovered the plot though. She lived under &quot;a curse&quot; that made her Shift. The Shift changed her into a horrible monster wolf. Those of her kind were called Karnee. If her secret became known, even her own House would kill her. Worse, the House would kill her entire family as well! <br />A Sabir Karnee, Ry, had found Kait at the wedding and declared her for his own. Kait must flee Ry, all five of the Houses, wizards, the Scarred, and even ghosts of the long dead as she strived to complete a quest for the Mirror of Souls! <br />**** This book would be a five star book if the ending had been different.

Charity feared what he planned to do with his dueling pistol and decided to steal it during the night, then bury it in the garden. But Anthony caught the feminine figure in his garden. She was veiled in mystery and cloaked in darkness. He thought of her as a fair wood sprite, created of mists and moonlight, just for him. The mystical encounter snapped him out of his depression and he looked forward to seeing her each midnight. Charity, though, decided to let herself have on night with Anthony and then let his mystery woman disappear forever. <br />***** Needless to say, THIS BOOK ROCKS! Each story is downright enthralling. In fact, delightful dreams can not help but happen if you go to bed shortly after reading any one of these tales. This novel will be forever labeled under the file, \\"Things that make you go 'Ahhhh'.\\" *****	2003-10-09

Brandon Pellidore, Marquess of Hartley, had to be careful. His family line was reported to have insanity. All who died due to it did so by age thirty. Therefore, Brandon would only receive his inheritance if he lived until age thirty without showing any of the insanity symptoms. Thirty was only a couple months away. Because Brandon was so careful and stand-offish around others, the Ton gave him the title \\"Lord Heartless\\". It gave Brandon the reputation he preferred. Then he met Celia Rider.<br />Celia was drawn to Brandon, even though she was promised to another. She was able to see behind his mask. Her title for him was \\"Lord Oberon\\". Brandon learned that Celia had been informed that her late father had left her penniless. Knowing it to be untrue, Celia was on a quest to locate her missing inheritance and find the thief. Brandon insisted on helping. Their investigation began to make someone nervous enough to attempt murder.<br />***** An incredible romance filled with danger, excitement, and betrayal. There is much more going on than my synopsis reveals between the main hero and heroine. In addition, there are several secondary characters that captured my attention from the start. Tantalizing sub-plots keep the story moving along at a fast pace. Read this! Can I make it any clearer? *****	2003-09-30

He did not believe in the mess at all. Yet the Gloomies were getting stronger lately. In fact, ever since the weird object fell from the heavens and landed somewhere in the mountains. Things and people began to change. Whatever landed in those mountains was growing and assaulting Tamara's mind in a psychic invasion.<br />Chester Mull KNEW something was going on! His dog has been turned inside-out, literally! People he used to call &quot;friends&quot; have drastically changed too. Their eyes glowed an eerie green and their skin seemed to be melting.<br />The zombies sought out other living beings to &quot;convert&quot;. Their master, Shu-Shaaa, was hungry and must be fed. It was assimilating itself into the biosystem of the planet, slowing learning and eating everything. As it fed, it searched for the meaning of one set of syllables that seemed to nag at its core. The syllables called &quot;Taa-maaa-raaa.&quot;<br />***** Stephen King and Dean Koontz fans need to sit up and take notice of this talented author.

It quickly becomes obvious the two cases are linked. Coffin asks DCI Phoebe Astley to help.

Married and then suddenly widowed, Chastity Somers intended to claim her bridegroom's inheritance as the long-lost St. Yves, Earl of Barrington, heir. She planned to use the estate, Sunnyledge, to run a children's home. She \\"rescued\\" her husband's four relatives (3 nephews and 1 niece) from a workhouse prison and dashed off to see the estate's solicitor, Mr. Sonnett. She must wait three months to claim the estate. If the other heir did not show up with proof of his identity by then, the estate would belong to Chastity! <br />Reed Gilbride believed himself to be the other long-lost heir. He believed the proof he needed was somewhere within Sunnyledge. With only a short time to locate proof he became the caretaker. The instant he found what he needed, the tempting lady and her brigand-brats would leave! But even though Reed went looking for his heritage, he never expected that he would find salvation! <br />***** As usual, Annette Blair has written an intense romance that will leave her readers begging for more! The villainess is one that is obviously insane and extremely wicked. I loved to hate the character, which proves the author's wonderful talent! The children and their antics kept me laughing while they easily melted Reed's icy heart. <br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Excellent! ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch.	2003-09-24

Conar and Liza were dedicated in their quest to destroy the Brotherhood of the Domination. <br />Conar's evil twin, Galen, wanted Conar dead and Liza by his side. Knowing this, the Domination planned to use Galen as a way to force Conar into returning to the Great Abbey of the Domination - from where he had escaped just before the age of thirteen.<br />The sorcerer known as Kaileel Tohre had always had a dark fascination with Conar. He wanted Conar the same way Liza did, as mate. To save Liza, Conar would return to the Domination and complete the Rite of Passage to become &quot;One of the Chosen&quot;.

Conar would possess the combined power of the White and the Black Paths. <br />The battle between good and evil continues!<br />***** RATED R for dark fantasy scenes and violence. No one under the age of 17 should read this series!

Three years have passed since Rabbi Tracy Cohen had battled against the undead in Arkansas. Her life partner, Jane Weston, felt invisible and worthless in Tracy's life. In fighting the undead Tracy did God's work. How could Jane ever compete with God? Fed up, Jane accepted a TV job elsewhere and left. <br />Tracy joined an intelligence agency that dealt with the extraordinary. The agency sent Tracy and her small group of fighters to Wako City. The city was torn by racism and the vampires had gathered among a group of Neo Nazis who were preparing to march through a part of the city heavily populated by Holocaust survivors. Tracy's estranged family lived in that part of the city as well. And Tracy needed to see them, needed to forgive them for what they had done to her. This was made even harder since the soulless seemed to be targeting her family.<br />Jane happened to be in Wako City as well. She noticed the bizarre happenings and just KNEW that Tracy would be the one in town to help out the police, with her golom at her side. Realizing how much she wanted and needed Tracy in her life, Jane began her search in hope of reconciliation. <br />**** This seems to be book two of a series. I missed book one, but have the third book waiting for me to begin. Even so, I did not feel as though I had been thrown into an abyss. The author did a wonderful job on the characters and the novel had closure. It could be read as a stand-alone book, however, it left me eager to see what the agency throws at Tracy's little group next! Tracy's life is much like the \\"Twilight Zone\\".

In the year 2025, a deadly air born virus known as Yuppie 25 escaped from a secret government lab. It was believed to have been on a scrap of toilet paper stuck to the bottom of a scientist's shoe as he left work. Yuppie 25 spread around the world at lightning speed. Riots broke out as all the leaders in the world died out. No country had leadership or laws any longer. The Yuppie madness sent people into rages, murder went unchecked.<br />One scientist noticed that certain people of a certain class and life style seemed to be completely immune to the bug. Tests showed that they had an unusual enzyme in their blood that was traced to a cheap preservative used in generic barbecue sauce which apparently mutated when it was grilled. The people who had consumed large amounts of the barbecue sauce on grilled meats over their life times had built up a natural immunity to Yuppie 25. Within a few months most of the population of the earth was dead. Only Bubbas and their families survived untouched. All others were zombies. <br />Bubbas had become the last hope for humanity! <br />***** Twenty stories and poems, including the Forward, grace this over-sized, paperback anthology. Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Horror, Red Neck jokes, and some pretty hilarious (if not warped) humor has been duct-taped together into stories for your enjoyment - by various authors whose sanity can not be guaranteed.

Sookie Stackhouse had been minding her own business, but Bad Luck found her. First one of her co-workers was murdered and no one else seemed to care. Then a beastly creature, called a maenad, gave Sookie's back a painful lashing laced with poison. A few vampires (Bill and Eric included) sucked the poison from her veins to save her. So when the vampires wanted Sookie to help them out with her special telepathic abilities, she agreed. <br />Bill and Sookie were sent to Dallas to help locate a missing vampire. A large religious group called &quot;The Fellowship Of The Sun&quot; was up to its neck in the mess. One slip by Sookie and the massacre would be awful. <br />**** This novel picks up close to where the first left off. This book, just like the previous one, is a mystery story that can stand by itself. Yu do not have to read the first to fully understand what is going on. The secondary characters from the first book are in this one too, however, more time is spent on the mystery. Very good reading here. ****	2003-09-21

Sookie Stackhouse was only interested in one vampire and that was Bill, her boyfriend. However, Bill seemed to be putting some distance between them recently. Then he disappeared to another state! His sinister and sexy boss, Eric, said that Bill had been summoned to Mississippi by Lorena. She was a lady vampire Bill had lived with for some time before. That was enough for Sookie. She was on the way to Mississippi. <br />Alcide Herveaux was to be Sookie's contact/guide. He was a werewolf. With his help, Sookie could enter places that mere mortals seldom dared tread, such as Club Dead. The vampire king of Mississippi (yes, readers, you read that correctly) was Russell Edgington. Russell took interest in Sookie very quickly. Eric arrived on the scene, in disguise as usual. Several attempts were made on Sookie's life and Bill was caught in an act of serious betrayal against Sookie's love. Sookie was not sure whether to save Bill or sharpen a few stakes of her own! <br />***** Much better than book two. Again, this mystery could be read as a \\"stand alone\\" book. But the main and secondary characters remain the same. The love triangle between Sookie, Bill, and Eric gets much rougher. That triangle is enjoyed more by those who have read the first two previous books though. <br />This entire series, thus far, is humorous, fun, very sexy, and highly recommended! *****	2003-09-21

Therefore, you see cameos of the ladies in stories other than their own. <br />*** Personally, I thought the first and last stories were the best. My favorite author, however, is one of the other two. I was a bit disappointed by that, but I now have two new names to add to my &quot;Check This Girl Out&quot; list. The authors did not make their heroines perfect either. Not many women today look anorexic. It is about time some curvy ladies get their stories told!

They urged Alison to either move on with her life or move back to her own house. Yet Alison could not bring herself to leave the small town and return to the house where she had so many memories. <br />Alison finally told Sarah that she would get on with her life - just as soon as she renovated the nearly ruined 1976 Corvette that was rusting in Sarah's garage. Alison knew absolutely NOTHING about cars. But she bought a manual and tools, rolled up her sleeves, and went to slow work. <br />Max Kesler was a handsome munitions expert. His father was a compulsive liar whose biggest lie (that was around fifty-years old) may soon become exposed. That lie made Mr. Kesler the town's celebrity!

Worse, his death is connected to an even greater crime that threatens the entire area and must be stopped, at the source, quickly. To complicate matters, King William show up and a plot to assassinate the King is in the works. <br />**** Here is a great mystery that is set during an unstable part of history.

They had two young sons named Thomas and Marc. As they began to settle in, the small town residents began telling Diane about the tragic history of their new home. The owners before them had been elderly. One died of fright. The other had been found at the bottom of the stairs. Before them, two male friends from the military had owned the house. They disappeared suddenly. Some say they were lost at sea which bordered the property. Others claim the two met with foul play. <br />Diane had always been sensitive to the after life. Since her husband was a skeptic, Diane had learned to keep silent, least he believe her crazy. Yet she knew that their new home was haunted by an unknown and restless spirit. Diane had to figure out WHO the spirit was and what it wanted, before her family became another tragic piece of the house's history. <br />**** Caveat Emptor is Latin and means Buyer Beware. This is a wonderful ghost story that sent chills down my spine. A short read of 133 pages, so it is a great way to spend a rainy afternoon or evening. Chapter One is a vision of Diane's and had me a bit confused. However, once I finished the book I went back and reread the chapter and realized that the author had given a few subtle clues. You mystery fans out there may want to pay very close attention to the first chapter. <br />Diane, needless-to-say, is the main character. The reader follows her as she tracks down the history of her home. For a small town, not many people are friendly. Neighbors are far apart. Woods surround the home and a path leads down to the beach, so Diane's family is pretty isolated. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED READING! ****	2003-09-08

Colton actually listened to Miranda and took her advice on how to train Starlight. <br />Miranda's mother was still engaged to Adam and the wedding day was drawing near. Miranda went to visit them briefly and met Adam's daughter, Margot. A shaky friendship began between the two girls.

Worse, Adam was showing his temper more often and Miranda's mom never noticed Adam's cruelness to anyone. When Miranda goes back to her grandparents, Margot goes with her. Slowly Margot begins to bloom. <br />**** I know a great series when I read one!

The M.O. of the killer reopened old wounds and rekindled her worst nightmares.<br />**** It is pretty easy to figure out who the killer is if you pay attention. Even so, this story is over-flowing with action and drama. The author keeps the readers' attention with a few sub-plots. All the characters are realistic and each has their own personality.

I had scratched my head often wondering the answer to that riddle. The mystery shows the medical records department of a hospital being involved. Due to a VERY recent and new law called HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), the chance of the violation detailed in the book is greatly diminished. Now that is not to say it still cannot happen. But the chances are much reduced.<br />The book is well written and a few sub-plots help move the story along. I believe this is the debut novel of the author. If so, it shows amazing talent. Everything is clear to the reader. I am very happy to be able to recommend this novel to all mystery lovers! ****	2003-07-02

Enid MacLean had been estranged from her husband for nine years. She survived by nursing those extremely ill. Then, out of the blue, she received word that an explosion had injured her husband. He was not expected to live, but Enid agreed to do her duty and try to nurse him back to health. Except for his distinctive green eyes, the man she nursed had changed. <br />When he first opened his eyes he believed Enid to be an angel. But the pain proved that he was NOT in heaven. The explosion took away his memory. He did not recognize his good friends or his own wife. Worse yet, the blast had not been an accident. Someone feared the knowledge locked away in his mind. <br />***** What can I say? It is by Christina Dodd, so you KNOW it will be great! I opened the book with that thought in mind. I closed the book only when the last page had been read. Yes, it is THAT good! A wonderful way to release yourself from your troubles, at least temporarily. *****	2003-07-01

Illumination Arts' latest release, Inside Out, is the story of a girl named Karly and her special invisible friend, Natasha. After reading this book with your child, you will always see an invisible friend as something very special...their spirit. You will learn the true meaning of the phrase that mothers everywhere tell their children, \\"It's what's on the inside that counts.\\" <br />Karly and Natasha were best friends and they played with great abandon. They laughed, romped, jumped, ran, and just in general enjoyed life together. Since no one else could see her best friend, Karly was a bit puzzled, and she questioned Natasha, \\"Why can't my mom see you?\\" <br />\\"I'm a spirit, silly...kind of like an angel without wings,\\" Natasha replied.<br />Karly and Natasha filled their days with wonder and joy and were truly happy as they played together. Natasha, who was very wise about these things, told Karly to always remember this feeling because it came from Karly's heart where her own shiny spirit lived.<br />Then, as always happens, the day came for Natasha to go back to the stars. \\"Always remember who you are...a beautiful, shiny spirit made of love and light,\\" Natasha had advised. \\"Your spirit helps you love yourself and everyone around you,\\" she continued, \\"but it's easy to be distracted by the outside world and forget who you really are.\\" Karly promised to always remember the things she had learned from Natasha about herself. She promised to never forget.<br />But, as the days and weeks passed, Karly did forget her spirit friend. Because she forgot, Karly lost the very best part of herself. She forgot who she really was! She grew very quiet and found it difficult to make friends. No one could see the real Karly!<br />Slowly, as her heart saddened, all the magic that had once filled her life was gone. Then, at her saddest moment, Natasha suddenly appeared. Karly was overjoyed, and Natasha helped her realize that by forgetting her special friend she had forgotten her ownspirit too. Karly vowed never to forget again and devised the perfect way to help her remember. Since her spirit lived inside her heart, she would live inside out so that it would always shine through. That way everyone would see the real Karly!<br />How did Karly remember to live inside out? I'll give you a clue...it had to do with her socks, and it will work for you too. <br />***** This is a wonderful story, and it is beautifully illustrated with bright colors and pictures that swirl over each page. A child's imagination can jump into the wind as it spins the leaves upward, or soar through the stars with Karly and Natasha as they play together. What a special way to learn one of life's most valuable lessons - each child is a special spirit filled with goodness, and life is best when lived inside out.	2003-06-30

No matter how much Drew hated royalty, it was a lot of beer money for a SIMPLE escort job. <br />***** This story is down-right edible! I felt as though Drew was a female Han Solo since her morals seem to be the same and her partner looks much like a Wookie. No nonsense, beer guzzling, hilarious, and NOT TO BE MISSED!

The teens' mission had two parts. The first and most important part was to locate and rescue Gillam. The second part was to learn about a renegade squad of young mercenaries that used the school as a training ground. <br />***** Brava, Jude Watson!

His mother, Jamie, went to a hospital for the summer. Robert and his baby sister, Sandy, went to be with Grandma Dahlen. Jamie was determined to get well and raise her children as best as she could. Grandma Dahlen would help. <br />Robert spent much of the summer learning about his mother's childhood. He visited all her favorite places and listened to stories about how well his mother could make music. She never played her instrument any more, out of guilt. Robert's gift was for art. He spent the summer drawing everything around him and his interpretation of his mother when she was young and happy. <br />As eighth grade began, Jaime was with Robert, Sandy, and Grandma Dahlen again. Jaime saw Robert's amazing drawing talent and made sure he was assigned a teacher who would appreciate his art. Therefore, Mr. Spencer came into Robert's life. <br />Mr. Spencer was a different type of teacher. He nurtured caring, sensitivity, and helped develop the talent of each individual child. Between Robert's unusual teacher, his mother, and his new school friends, Robert would do much growing, and much healing. <br />**** This book shows a multitude of things to the reader. It shows that people CAN get out of abusive situations, however, it is not easily done and much healing is needed afterward. It shows a different way for teachers to teach inside the classroom, helping the children in more ways than just book learning. If the reader is pre-teen and just out of an abusive life, it shows hope and gives strength. <br />The book is written simply so the reader may be an adult or as young as age ten.

The second part is due for release in December 2003. It will be titled \\"The Destroyer Goddess\\". <br />Even if you did not read \\"In Legend Born\\" you will easily understand all that is happening.

A successful nineteenth-century businessman, Alexander Becket, was a rich and eccentric fellow who founded an exclusive little country that never prospered past the year of 1450. To enter \\"Becket\\" was like walking back in time. It was a medieval society. It remained that way even as the rest of the world progressed around it.<br />Charles Hepburn entered a forest and became lost. After wandering for three days he stumbled into Becket. Enchanted by the realm, he requested permission from King James to remain instead of returning to the Outside. Charles was appointed tutor to the Crown Princes. However, he ended up being taken under the wing by the King's Champion, Lord Robert.<br />Robert MacKinnon, Seventh Duke of Northumberland, made Charlie his protege. Determined to have Charlie knighted within a year, Robert taught him the art of warfare with various weapons. The two become close friends and the reader follows them as they deal with ambushes, betrayals, fights, and political intrigue.<br />*** This is book one of a series. The first hundred pages are spent helping the reader understand how Charles left modern civilization to embrace the secluded medieval society and who the main characters of the first book will be. From then on, the Outside world is rarely mentioned. Charles learns about the realm, enters battle-after-battle, and meets interesting characters along the way.<br />It is my belief that from book two onward, the series may get even more interesting. The characters will already be known by the reader and time will not have to be spent getting orientated. All-in-all, I found this to be a VERY good debut novel and worthy of anyone who is a fan of medieval history. ***	2003-06-06

Miss Cassiopeia \\"Cassie\\" Bentbrooke was considered an oddity. At the old age of 27 she was considered to be \\"on the shelf\\", just as she wished to be. Cassie had no interest in marriage at all. Cassie cared for only two things; Liza's well-being (her ward) and continuing her late father's work of astronomy. Every clear night found Cassie on the roof with her father's instruments and journals. When her father's assistant had died Cassie logged all her father's findings for him - IN CODE. <br />Suddenly everything began happening at once. [...]<br />Everyone was looking for some sort of treasure and believed the location to be hidden among the pages of the journals that were filled with only facts about the Heavens. Cassie had to figure out what was really going on, and quickly, as things were beginning to become dangerous. <br />***** If you are looking for an air-headed heroine whose goal in life is to faint then this book is not for you! Cassie is a level headed and strong willed heroine that I fell in love with quickly and admired throughout the novel. Devon is a sexy hero too, but there were times I just wanted him to open up to Cassie. Luckily, he did not. Here is a book that will intrigue you whether you like gazing at the stars or not.

There are six stories in this anthology of Honor's famous universe (created by author David Weber). This will have to be a long review because I want to give a synopsis of each story, as well as a rating. The book's total rating, from me, should be considered as 4.5 stars!<br />The first story is Promised Land by Jane Lindskold. Judith was Grayson-born. As a child she was kidnapped when the merchant vessel she and her parents were traveling on was attacked by Masadan pirates. Judith's parents were killed, but her dying mother told Judith to never let the Masadans know she could read! Judith suffered much abuse as one of Ephraim's wives. However, an elite secret organization, made of females, plotted, planned, and got ready for the day of their salvation. They would get only one chance. They would all escape or be captured and executed as example to others. <br />**** If you love stories by David Weber then THIS author is one to watch! Very well done indeed. **** <br />The second story is With One Stone by Timothy Zahn. We zip back to the days when SHE was \\"Captain\\" Honor Harrington of the heavy cruiser HMS Fearless. Lieutenant (Senior Grade) Rafael \\"Rafe\\" Cardones was Honor's tac officer. These two are the main characters of this awesome story! <br />Someone in Silesia space had gotten hold of an advanced form of the grav lance. Since Rafe was the only RMN tac officer who's ever used a grav lance in combat, he was temporarily assigned to an elite group and a top secret ONI mission. Honor was on an escort mission but ordered to abandon the ships she escorted if she came across the pirate ship with the advanced grav lance and pursue it. The two missions, of course, would end up in one huge climatic battle. <br />***** Oh yes! Author Timothy Zahn did especially well on this story. It was great to read one of Honor's early battles. So well done I could have sworn Weber, himself, wrote it! ***** <br />The third story is A Ship Named Francis by John Ringo & Victor Mitchell. Sick Berth Attendant Third Class Sean Tyler was beginning his second hitch with the Manticoran Navy. He thought transferring to the Grayson service and working with other Alliance forces was a good move in his career. He could never have imagined what Fate had in store for him. <br />The first day Tyler set foot on the Francis Mueller he knew the transfer had been a bad move. The entire ship was held together by sweat and prayer ... literally! Every day began with a prayer that always sounded more like an eulogy and by the end of the day at least one crew member had to be tranked due to stress. And those were the GOOD days! <br />***** This is an extremely short story, about twenty pages total. Out of this entire novel though, this is my FAVORITE! I laughed myself silly during the whole thing! Pure Sci-Fi bliss! ***** <br />The fourth story is Let's Go To Prague by John Ringo. Major John Mullins and his partner, Major Charles Gonzalves decided to take some leave on Prague disguised as StateSec officers. A little blackmail later, they were vacationing among the enemy. When a Manti covert operation went bad, John and Charles was (unluckily) there to pick up the ball. Now they must get themselves, a defecting admiral, and a soiled dove off the planet - FAST! Hard to do when the entire planet was hunting you. <br />**** That is the gist of it. To tell more would ruin it for the reader. Suffice it to say that fans of author John Ringo will not be disappointed in this fast paced adventure. Terrific reading. **** <br />The fifth story is Fanatic by Eric Flint. Esther McQueen had failed her coup attempt in Nouveau Paris. StateSec is in chaos. Citizen Rear Admiral Genevieve Chin, Citizen Commodore Jean-Pierre Ogilve, and Yuri Radamacher (the People's Commissioner FOR Ogilve) are fretting over the fact that the People's Commissioner, Jamka, had gotten himself murdered - not that anyone cared since Jamka was an embarrassment in many ways. The problem now is that Oscar Saint-Just the head of Haven's State Security, is sending Citizen Captain Cachat to their sector of La Martine to investigate the murder and execute all who are guilty of anything! <br />**** In a sentence, Cachat is to persuade the personnel to admit any crimes and kill the ones guilty of the major crimes. Cachat has a license to kill and really is the fanatic people claim him to be! The story is riddled with a few twists as well. The readers are kept guessing and the ending is unexpected. An interesting glimpse into the Peeps' military. ****<br />The last story is The Service Of The Sword by David Weber. Midshipwoman Abigail Hearns was in an awkward position. She was not only a steadholder's daughter, but also the very first midshipwoman in the Grayson Space Navy. In fact, Abigail was the first Grayson-born woman EVER sworn into the service of the Sword. During her training on Saganami Island, people considered her to be Lady Honor Harrington's protégée. <br />Abigail became part of Snotty Row upon a Manti heavy cruiser called Gauntlet. The ship was ordered to investigate the disappearance of ships, possible space pirates, in the Tiberian System. It was an independent system that had few inhabitants and those few were not advanced tech-wise. They lived simply and preferred little or no contact with Outsiders. Abigail would face much friction in her new post and some hoped she would fail. However, Abigail was about to prove to everyone just how Harrington-like she was! <br />***** This one reminded me of Honor's first mission. Abigail thinks differently just like Honor does. Any fan of Weber's Honor Harrington series will be fascinated with this tale! Another winner by Weber!	2003-05-23

Not willing to let another woman he loves die, Call forces Charity to leave both him and her dreams behind. Will her return to New York mean the chance Charity and Call had for a new life be gone for good?<br />***** In a novel of sweeping adventure and suspense, Ms. Martin catches readers up in a dazzling story. Love shines through on every page, even in the highest danger. Suspense, romance, and a touch of the paranormal all play a part in making this a keeper book. The ending is one that will satisfy the romatic at heart, but all the events that lead to that ending will make you wish it never had to come.	2003-05-23

Haley was with her family at a restaurant when her eyes locked with his. At first glance he looked like an ordinary teen, but his eyes radiated danger and menace. Bravely Haley corned him only to have him vanish! By accident, the guy had left behind a pair of glasses with reflective dark lenses and seven wings carved in the frames.<br />When Haley wore the glasses it all looked like the world she knew, however, much was different. For example, cats do NOT wear collars that allowed them to talk and ask you to scratch them behind their ears, right? Wary of the sunglasses, Haley was unable to decide whether to destroy them or keep using them.<br />Haley knew she simply HAD to figure out what the glasses really were and how to work them. The glasses were her only hope to prevent a murder.<br />I have found that when I see a book with the names L.J. Singleton OR Linda Joy Singleton there is no need to read the back. No matter what it is about, it is going to be great. This story is no exception. It contains a fascinating plot and some interesting theories to boggle the mind. I loved every minute and recommend it highly.	2003-05-23

Cabrillo University in San Diego was granted Simon, the world's most powerful super-computer, for their experiment.

One wall was constantly damp due to the Ocean Park dolphin tank being on the other side of the wall. But the heat Simon generated would take care of that and no one worried. <br />No one could have foreseen the unintended consequences that would follow!

It was painted red to summon the First Son to defeat the Second Son. When Wendell sacrificed a child his congregation hung him from the rafters of his own sanctuary. <br />The red church stood empty for twenty years. It was going to ruin until Archer McFall purchased it. It was called the Temple of the Two Sons and most of the town's residents quickly joined, as their ancestors had before. The zealous worshipers had no idea that they would be simply pawns and sacrifices as the demonic Archer exercised his revenge! <br />***** W - O - W! Now here is a novel that will send chills up your spine. I often found myself repelled and attracted at the same time as the grizzly plot unfolded. Fans of Stephen King and Dean Koontz will LOVE this talented author! I am eager for Nicholson's next release. *****	2003-05-12

Joie Sanders was one of the best bodyguards around. Wounded during duty, she ended up in a hospital for treatment. Joie dealt with the pain by imagining herself in the mountains. It was a trick she had often used, never suspecting that she really was traveling outside her body. In those mountains she met Traian. He was wounded as well and lay in a dark cave. Once their minds touched Joie could not escape Traian's voice. He had linked with her, knowing instantly that she was \\"the one\\". He had waited several life times for her. <br />The second is The Star Queen by Susan Grant. Romjha B'kak was leader of an elite group called Raiders. Tai Sai was th group's bombmaker. The group was about to meet some royal outsiders from the stars that would change their lives!<br />The third is Sacrilege by Susan Squires. Magda had been at the Mirso Monastery to overcome her addiction of taking the last drop of blood from her victims. Those within the monastery taught against pleasure and emotions. Love was to be avoided at all costs. Those who failed the teachings were hunted down by the Harrier and executed. When Brother Pietr believed Magda ready, he sent her to San Francisco. She was met by Davinoff and helped to blend in. But Pietr had done the unthinkable. He had fallen in love with Magda. When his mentor, Rubius, found out of Pietr's feelings, he sent the Harrier out to assassinate Magda, though she had done no wrong! <br />**** Paranormal, Science Fiction, and Romance blend together for this collection of novellas.

Teena Halliday is sent to stay with her only other relatives (at Rentlow Retreat) for six months. The whole family is odd and seem to resent Teena being there. Jeremy Rentlow is a noted sculptor and insists Teena pose for him. However, all of his past creations are all that remain of the people and animals he had worked on before. All died mysteriously on the same night Jeremy finished their likeness. Teena does not wish to pose for him, and says so, but ends up relenting and letting him work her likeness into marble.<br />Soon after the sittings get underway, Teena begins to feel weak and tired, but Jeremy refuses to let her miss a session. Suddenly Jeremy tells his family of their engagement! It shocks Teena as well as the family, since she had never been proposed to by Jeremy, nor has the idea ever been brought up!<br />Then Teena notices strange marks on her neck, put there by Jeremy, though she can only vaguely recall his lips at her neck while posing. She dares not ask if they are the marks of a vampire. Teena has become a prisoner at Rentlow Retreat and cannot escape.<br />**** The cover is typical gothic. Dark background with a huge, gloomy mansion in the back and a lovely lady in the foreground that seems to be trying to flee some sort of evil. The great thing about old gothics is that you never know what the ending will be. Many old gothics DO NOT have the \\"happily-ever-after\\" endings. This always seems to add spice to the stories though.<br />This book was written in the late 1970's and can no longer be found in the local bookstores as new. However, I enjoyed it so much I wanted to post a review and tell everyone to haunt their local used book stores for this title! Amazon often has one or two copies available as USED. If you can find it, you will LOVE it. ****	2003-05-09

Thea's family is more \\"stubborn\\" (a.k.a. pig-headed) than anyone I have ever met! <br />Author Gayle Buck has earned herself a place of honor on my bookshelf.

Not only that, but Dan was not at all who she thought, but according to the FBI, a terrorist for the IRA's more radical side. <br />Bitter and hurting, Charlotte begins life anew in another state, and nearly two years pass. Then, she is contacted again by the authorities, seeking her help in nabbing \\"Dan\\". She is unable to help, however that does not stop her kidnapping shortly thereafter.

Matters escalate, and she finds herself on the lam from the law, not sure who the enemy really is, or who her captor is or is not. All she is sure of is that she finds him too attractive.<br />***** In this complex thriller, Ms. Cresswell is elevated to the level of Sandra Brown's best work. The plot is one that is all too timely, and chilling. Though savy readers will doubtlessly figure out one or two of the surprises before their revelation, that does not lessen the spine tingling adventure or the mental challenge presented. The hero is an enigma, and Charlotte a truly gutsy, clever lady with resilence that can only be admired. You will be left breathless and cheering. *****	2003-04-25

This one kept me guessing all the way through. Some hot love scenes, so consider yourself warned in advance. The story hooked me on the first page and never let me go. In fact, I did not get up from the sofa even once until the story was finished. Yes, it is that good! I hope to see more of the Colby Agency!	2003-04-17

She has discovered her elderly neighbor lying comatose, the apparent survivor of the city's current serial killer, the transvestite killer. Mel now feels responsible for taking care of the old lady's dog while she lies in the hospital, and walking the giant dog with a pea sized bladder is causing serious complications to her life. With the assistance of well meaning friends, she tracks down the woman's one living relative, Max, a nephew, and contacts him to come help with the dog, and see his dying aunt.<br />Max is, however, a selfish SOB, who had rather complete his vacation with a Victoria's Secret supermodel than come walk a great dane and visit an old, but rich relative. Thus, he calls in a favor and enlists John Trent to impersonate him so that should his aunt awaken, she won't think him the uncaring cad he really is. Reluctantly, John agrees, and immediately finds himself falling for Mel. The attraction is mutual, but the matter of his deception lies between them. What will happen should Mel find out that \\"Max\\" is John? <br />***** In this hilarious tale told via email messages, Ms. Cabot has created a GRIFFIN AND SABINE for the new generation. We get to see all sides of the story as Mel and John's friends and families communicate their varied opinions of the whole situation. From Mel's newly emailing parents, to her catty coworker who has inherited her exboyfriend, to the supermodel Max is dating, we are charmed by the situation that is so unbelieveable that it could be real. If this were a movie, Meg Ryan and Hugh Grant would be the ideal stars.	2003-04-17

From the moment they meet, Tally and Michael are drawn to one another, leading to some of the hottest ... scenes you will find in a non erotica labeled book. <br />For years, Michael has worked to end the career of the criminal who ended his partner and friend's life. Yet he now finds himself in love with the villain's daughter, an innocent raised away from his criminal activities. As they grow closer, his dilema worsens. Yet, all is not as it appears, and hidden things come out of the sea to attempt to wreck havoc in Michael and Tally's romance and lives. <br />...Though Micheal is one of the ...hunks of the romance world, and Tally is endearing with her many quirks that bring laughter to the novel, I found the plot a bit thin. Without the love scenes, there would be little left to the book, and some readers might find the explicity offensive. However, there is strong characterization and a good element of humor.	2003-04-17

Wade Benedict, fulfilling his friend's final wish that his daughter be rescued from the Arabian land where she moved with her mother. Unfortunately, despite the harsh conditions, or rather, because of them, the lady in question, does not want to be rescued, preferring to stay, fighting for freedom. Wade, however, will go to any length to get her out, though when Chloe realizes she can continue her work back home in Louisiana, and that her cruel stepbrother's plans for her marriage to gain her money will place her life into a literal hell, she agrees. <br />The battle to get out of the country is bloody, but they manage to survive, only to find that it has followed them home, and is not a Jihad, a holy war, that pulls in the entire clan into even more fights, barely escaping with their lives. Perhaps of equal importance are the battles of the heart Chloe and Wade face as they must decide what to do with the relationship they have found themselves suddenly to be in, each with their own issues to face before they can claim the love that awaits them, if they survive. <br />***** In the most exciting novel of the series, WADE concludes Ms Blake's Bayou Brothers line, making me sorry I have missed all but one of the others, if they are all this fine. <br />Readers get to catch up with characters who have surely become their friends in past books, and to meet a dynamic new couple. Heart pounding excitement never lets up, though romantic interludes amidst it all light up the pages with passion instead of gunfire. Every character is vibrantly drawn, and the storyline is one that could be ripped from current life as the Taliban and their world seem to haunt our everyday lives. Brava, Ms. Blake. Perhaps she can find another Benedict cousin hiding in the swamplands, if we are lucky.	2003-04-17

Both storylines are endearing and captivating, as you can always expect with this writer. Her characters, as always, are easy to relate to, as if you already knew them, or someone just like them.

But she had left that all behind when she ran away from her abused life and divorced Hank. <br />Lori was now named Serenity Clare. She lived in Lost Creek, New Mexico. She was a red head, single, and told fortunes during festivals. She was now the direct opposite of what she once was. Only the fear of Hank ever showing up remained from her previous life. Then a handsome stranger showed up at her door. <br />The man had wandered in from the desert half dead and with no memory of who he was. The only thing he could recall was the name Lori Perkins. But Serenity had never met the man before. Fearing Hank could have sent him to harm her, but somehow trusting him, she allowed him to remain with her. (Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.) She would care for his injuries and find out who he was. Until then she nicknamed him Justus, because a tarot reading stated he had \\"justice\\" on his side. Serenity did not know she was opening the door to her past AND her future! <br />** I cannot say enough great things about this story! Simply put, it was wonderful. A strong hero with an even stronger heroine. I found myself proud of Serenity, and when a reader can feel something for a character, then the author has done an outstanding job! Here is a book you will be unable to put down until the last page has been turned. Non-stop action with heart-stopping (but not too detailed) romance. PERFECT!	2003-04-17

It was also a cover for Montana Confidential, a government organization placed there to deal with The Black Order. Dimitri Chilton was the leader of The Black Order. The terrorist group had been annoying for a couple of years now. Montana confidential planned to end it once and for all.

It was nothing he had not done several times before. But Whitney was not the defenseless, spoiled rotten, heiress people believed. Vincent had met his match! <br />**** It was refreshing to see an heiress who had some grit in her. I had gotten very tired of fainting debutantes in need of a big, strong man. Especially those from old money or in high politics. The author, Julie Miller, gave the characters in this book cunning and class. Each character had their own background and personal traits.

They are set in present time. Each contain a piece of jewelry that contain the magical emeralds from a historic family called Montclair. Personally, I loved the first and third in the book. The middle story I thought dragged too long. Not much seemed to happen. I admit to reading only half of it before moving on to the third story, so it may have picked up later in the story. However, if a book has not captured me in the first chapter, much less half way through it, I feel the need to move on. On a side note, this novel is a follow-up to Barbara Delinsky's book, \\"Fulfillment\\". All-in-all, I recommend it for some great reading.	2003-04-17

Had Owen married her only to con her family into merging companies? Angie decided the consummation of her new marriage would be put on hold until she found out! <br />***** The early works of author Jayne Ann Krentz has long been my favorites. I decided to pull out a few of them, during my short vacation, and escape for awhile. This novel (along with \\"Family Man\\") is one of the best, in my opinion. It is loaded with romance, suspense, danger, mystery, and a gothic flavor. Victoria Holt fans would especially love this one.

Zoe Luce was an interior designer and owned a shop called Enhanced Interiors. She had talent that she considered to be a curse, walls spoke to her. Well, in a way. If any strong emotion happened in a room, such as lust or fear, it would sink into the walls. So when Zoe went into a client's bedroom and the walls \\"screamed\\", Zoe could not leave fast enough! Whatever horrible thing happened in that room was recent. The client said he was going through a divorce. Zoe believed he murdered his wife in that bedroom. Without proof, cops would laugh at her. Besides, she could be wrong. The wife could be sunning herself on a tropical beach somewhere. Zoe simply needed a computer whiz to discretely find out. <br />Ethan Traux had taken over Truax Investigations from his uncle. Zoe would be his first case. It should have been simple. Only a few minutes on the computer to see if a lady was using her credit cards or an ATM. Instead, Ethan found a corpse. <br />Zoe and Ethan became attracted to each other. All seemed to be going well. However, Zoe's dark past was about to catch up to her. After a year of hiding under a different name, they had finally found her! <br />***** Wonderful! Zoe always seemed to be bubbling over with optimism no matter how awful things became. But she sure had to tap deeply into a bottomless well of optimism to get through all this! Zoe was a strong willed character that needed an extra ordinary man in her life. Author Jayne Ann Krentz did a wonderful job in creating just such a man. <br />This novel was like having two books in one, a murder mystery and a romantic thriller. The \\"client\\" part was a work of genius on Krentz's side to bring the couple together. The author brought back the Vastu and Feng Shui techniques that I recall being used in one of her novels a few years ago. This is a fast paced, romantic, and heart pounding thriller that I highly recommend to all.	2003-04-17

Readers get a glimpse of what makes Lava so nutty at times. The glance into his past makes for some possible interesting future SunBird stories. Sapphire is not as gun-ho as he was in the previous stories either. In fact, Sapphire seems to be maturing a little bit with each book.<br />***** The author, A.A. Browne, has thrown in a territorial fight between the hawks and the owls as well. This little sub-plot makes for a great adventure. It MAY also foreshadow a future novel in this series. (I can only hope.) Very little is mentioned about the beetles this time around, but that in NO WAY detracts from this lively story from a young author who clearly understands the subject of peacocks. \\"BRAVO!\\" Mr. Browne.

Dagar's depredations MUST be stopped and Edris' rai must be brought back from the Void. <br />Many twists pop up in this book. Every time I believe Ryel is almost omnipotent, the author does something unexpected to make his powers seem childish in comparison. The character of Dagar, the evil villain, was done especially well. He seemed almost unbeatable, which added a delightful tension to the whole story. <br />If you have not read the first book, WYSARD, I recommend you do so before beginning this second book. Though you would be able to understand all that happens, it would flow nearly as smoothly. Wonderfully composed novel!	2003-04-09

But after the first few chapters, the story picked up and held onto me. I understand it to be the first of a trilogy or series, but I am not sure. Salvatore fans will NOT be disappointed. However, expect a Sci-Fi, instead of a Fantasy, for the beginning to set up the plot.	2003-04-04

But when she found herself surrounded by fire at Madame Michaela's dressmaking shop, she vowed to marry the man who rescued her, if she lived. <br />The man who saved her was Wynn Ingram, Viscount Ingall. He had been exiled six years ago for dueling with Lord Lynbrook. He was NOT accepted by polite society and could care less by the fact. He was only in England to deal with three problems, all concerning letters sent to him by women. When Torrie offered marriage, he politely refused. He did, however, consider the government post her father offered him. Regardless of what Wynn said, he was very attracted to Torrie. <br />One of her rejected suitors, Lord Boyce, was out to compromise her. Lord Boyce and Wynn knew each other from younger days. Neither cared for the other. But Lord Boyce needed Torrie's money desperately and would go to any lengths to get it. <br />***** Very well done! This story began in the middle of a dangerous situation and captured my interest immediately. The author added little sub-plots, such as the three women Wynn was dealing with, to keep events lively as well. <br />This is the PERFECT book for a dull or rainy afternoon to help the time FLY by.

Then he became an apprentice to Rigby Skeet, Sword For Hire. A smuggled message landed in their hands to reveal that the \\"deceased king\\" was not really dead. Instead, King Olive was caged in a far away dungeon and guarded by \\"the Boneman\\". The two set out to rescue their true king from the evil guards. <br />I found this story to be an absolute delight!  All through the book I chuckled and often I found myself laughing out loud. The author expressed even the most common things in the most unusual and humorous ways. For example: \\"Imagine a dark, sinister-looking castle, then multiply by two and you'd have the castle of the Boneman.\\" <br />The author also added some strange personalities that kids of all ages cannot help but find amusing, such as the false king who enjoyed nothing more than putting worms on top of his head. It is things such as these that will make young readers WANT to read. Each chapter is short, which is recommended for younger readers as well. And of course, there must be (and is) a beautiful damsel in distress that needs to be rescued. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	2003-03-31

Treason may lurk around any corner and being at court was more dangerous than anyone today could possibly imagine. <br />Author Elizabeth Chadwick's pen has taken real people from the past and written an awesome tale of the love, hatred, and betrayal, that existed during the past of England and Normandy.

Even though the fallen Keeper Bailic had the book titled \\"First Truth\\" he could not open it. It was warded well and only the person it \\"claimed\\" could open it for the knowledge within. Bailic believed Strell to be the latent Keeper and blackmailed Strell to learn magic from him. Once the musician knew enough magic and opened the book, Strell and Alissa would be expendable. <br />Secretly Alissa was under the tutelage of the last surviving Master. She had no idea how special she was and the Master feared that he could not bring her magical abilities to full maturity alone. If he failed though, she would die. <br />Near the Hold was the abandoned city of Ese'Nawoer where thousands of guilty souls waited to serve the one who would waken the city. If Bailic had his way, he would claim those souls and order them to spread madness among the lands, causing the farmers and the plainsmen to go to war. <br />***** Author Dawn Cook pleases her readers again with this novel, the sequel to \\"FIRST TRUTH\\". I actually found myself holding my breath during a couple of tense moments as I read. The novel is even better than the first, which I did not even believe possible.

Her small bird, Talon, went with her. On the way, they met a wandering musician from the plains named Strell. Even though the farmers and the plainsmen did not get along well, they traveled together hoping to locate the Hold before the snows began. <br />Bailic was the only Keeper left in the Hold. The power hungry man had sent all the Masters, except one, away on a wild goose chase and then killed the other Keepers. The only Master left was trapped in a hidden dungeon. Bailic searched for a book filled with spells and power called First Truth. When two travelers appeared at the gate, he could sense that one was a latent Keeper, but could not tell which. Regardless, he would use them. Once no longer needed, they would die! <br />***** Here is an AWESOME new author and I expect her to become very well known fast! Dawn Cook has created a magical world with amazing characters. <br />I quickly found myself engrossed in the the story line and was irritated every time I had to stop reading.

This is a suspense filled story that tackles a field that is seldom seen in a thriller novel, the world of martial arts. <br />The author was able to teach me SO MUCH about the culture without me even realizing I was learning. Those, like myself, who know very little about this topic will NOT be hindered. The story flows evenly and all is spelled out so you can easily understand. For those of you, like my husband, who DO know the topic, do not worry. The author does not insult your intelligence. You are likely to find yourself nodding while you read. However, the author does not write unnecessary details so you will not feel the need to begin skimming pages. Recommended reading.	2003-03-23

This book details Cell group organisation, and the basic mechanics of winning a revolution, set in a Science Fiction background.<br />Tom Clancy has said of Robert A. Heinlein, \\"We proceed down the path marked by his ideas. He shows us where the future is.\\" Nowhere is this more true than in Heinlein's gripping tale of revolution on the moon in 2076, where \\"Loonies\\" are kept poor and oppressed by an Earth-based Authority that turns huge profits at their expense. A small band of dissidents, including a one-armed computer jock, a radical young woman, a past-his-prime academic and a nearly omnipotent computer named Mike, ignite the fires of revolution despite the near certainty of failure and death.	2003-03-21

In New York City in the late '90s, a 17-year-old girl heads off to her private school even though she has a cold. By art class her nose is gushing mucus and she's severely disoriented. Within seconds, it seems, she's in convulsions and, most bizarrely, can't stop biting herself. All the reader can do is hope she'll die quickly, but Kate Moran's body still has a few more disgusting turns to undergo, and Richard Preston--a Jacobean master of ceremonies par excellence--takes us through them in bizarre and bloody detail. <br />Clearly, whatever Kate had was a head cold with a scientific vengeance. Preston's heroine, Alice Austen, a doctor with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, realizes--in the first of several gripping autopsy scenes--that the girl's nervous system had been virtually destroyed. So far, only one other person is known to have died in the same way, but he was a homeless man. Austen must connect the two cases, seemingly linked only by the subway, before the media gets hold of them and drums up a paranoia-fest--and before the virus's creator can kill again. <br />***** The Cobra Event is itself a paranoia-fest, a provocative thriller that makes you wonder exactly how much bioterrorism is taking place in the real world. Preston, best known for his terrifying chronicle of the Ebola virus, The Hot Zone, and other impeccably researched nonfictions, is not content to create fast-paced nightmarish scenes. His novel is instead a complex morality tale anchored in uncomfortable fact. Preston is keen to convey the \\"invisible history\\" of bioweapons engineering and, equally, to show the unsung heroism of his scientific detectives (along with that of the nurses and technicians who literally sacrifice their lives for medicine). Like their creator, these characters are not without a sense of humor. One calls the manmade virus \\"the ultimate head cold.\\" Readers will never forget literally dozens of scenes and will never again see the subway, rodents, autopsy knives, and--above all--runny noses in the same light.	2003-03-21

Upon arrival, Abby was to complete a series of tasks before claiming her inheritance. Mrs. Hannah Greaves went along as her counselor and companion for the long journey. <br />Clarissa had been known as \\"La Grande Clarissa, courtisane extraordinaire\\"! Even knowing she had been his late father's mistress, Jared had fond memories of her. He had often visited Clarissa while he grew simply because she treated him as a son instead of as a member of the snobbish Ton.

After a truce (sort of) they did each task ... well, not smoothly, let me just say that Miss Clarissa made sure the couple had some adventures. The author, Blair Bancroft, is beyond awesome! I am hoping that Jared's brother, Myles, will get his own story in the near future. <br />Even though Clarissa was deceased, the author was able to develop the character's personality. This shows the author's talent in her writing field. Highly recommended reading! *****	2003-03-17

Sovereigns, diplomats, and ministers from all over Europe gathered in Vienna to reestablish order after years of war and upheaval. (In simple terms, everyone gathered to redraw the map after the depredations of Napoleon.) <br />Miss Helena Devereux was the stepdaughter of the Prince von Hohenbachern. She was in Vienna with her mother, the lovely Princess von Hohenbachern. The two women were different in their looks, as well as, their interests. While Helena was intelligent and kept very close tabs on politics, her mother was downright beautiful and wanted only to have fun again now that travel was no longer dangerous. The prince was not in Vienna. Instead, he remained with his armies on the Saxon border. <br />Major Lord Brett Stanford was in Vienna as Wellington's aide. He was a war hero many times over and was constantly on the look out for possible spies. Brett and Helena meet, learn they share views on politics, and become partners, of a sort. <br />** No real danger or intrigue begins until shortly after the first 110 pages. Until then everything is setting up all the players, making sure the reader understands the political happenings, having Brett and Helena meet, and then begin to trust each other. Since so much is required to set up the plot of the book and the players, I found the first half of the novel very complex and often tedious to read through. I had to make sure I understood everything and everyone, which required much back tracking to re-read several sections to be positive I did not misunderstand something. The author did a wonderful job of explaining it all so that people, such as myself, who know little or nothing about the setting's era can understand it all. Yet I could not relax and just enjoy the story until the last half. I had to study history until then. <br />If you are looking for romance, light reading, or a bit of humor, pass on this one. However, if you are a European history buff you will adore this novel.**	2003-03-17

Raisers) do not know it, but there is a new intelligence on the planet that intends to wipe out the humans and become the new rulers!<br />This new intelligence has all the Fl-eyes (flies) on its side. The Fl-eyes have \\"made\\" a dimension called the W-D, which is controlled by a computer. The dimension was made to use matter and rearrange it into anything they wanted. The main part of the plan was to build a one-hundred thousand bug army out of matter. However, the W-D did not supply the matter, it only gave tools to work on it.<br />Another rule of the W-D is that only living matter could be used to create new living beings. Non-living matter could only be used to create non-living items. Therefore, the Fl-eyes had to get a fresh supply of living matter.<br />Aquarius is a handsome Indian Blue Peacock. He lives at the SunSet Hills farm. Andrew, his \\"Raiser\\", fed and watered all of them twice a day. Andrew helped his new peachick hatch from its shell. The peachick was even granted a name, Mocha. This is a special thing! Not all the animals on the farm received names!<br />The animals of SunSet Hills were afraid of the Raisers. The peachicks before Mocha had gotten weak and disappeared. All believed the Raisers were killing them. No one could ask the Raisers if it was true though, because humans could only hear in three dimensions, instead of four. When animals spoke, humans only heard garbled sounds instead of words.<br />Everything remained in confused chaos until Mr. Gleam, a beetle from an underground laboratory approached Aquarius.<br /> Aquarius is the main character followed in this novel. The author, A. A. Browne, writes what he knows about. In this case, breeding and raising different types of peacocks. Apparently the author has a vivid imagination as well. Like the classic novel \\"Animal Farm\\", the animals can speak and have their own world. Yet A. A. Browne has gone a step further by giving the animals labs and high tech gadgets that surpass the humans.<br />This is the first of what is shaping up to be a GREAT series for anyone age ten or above. I loved every minute of it.	2003-03-14

Since there was no other to inherit the title, and so many depended on it, he sent the title to his grandson, Lad, in America. He had Diana write out his wishes of Lad coming to claim the title, care for the castle and people, and marry Diana.<br />P. Lad Walker had lost his parents and brothers. Some to the war, some due to other causes. He was urged to go see the land his father had spoken so much about, even though Lad had his own estate to run in America. Once there he fell in love with Diana. She returned the feeling. However, she would never leave Kerlain and he could not imagine staying. None of the people liked him since he was American. None would listen to his American methods of putting the castle and its land back on its feet. To make matters worse, he lost the estate to a man to Eoghan in a card game during a time of grieving. He did not know how much the man coveted his wife. Lad had thought the man in only friend in the country.<br />Diana was being blackmailed by Eoghan. Eoghan gave her three years to pay back the sum he named for regaining Kerlain. The hardest thing Diana ever had to do was send Lad away to find the funds. If she left England with her husband, Eoghan would see it that the estate went to ruin and that the tenants, down to the last child, would die of starvation. Diana had to agree that if Lad, the new Earl, could not pay the sum, then she would willingly divorce Lad, marry him, and be his wife in all ways. This bargain she could not reveal to her husband though. If Lad were to know, he would kill Eoghan. Lad, being American, would not even get a trial.<br />Incredible story! Diana is such a brave and strong woman. Lad was her match in every way. Author, Mary Spencer, concluded this marvelous trilogy with a big climax. A keeper for your book shelves!	2003-03-14

Aw c'mon, we all have a mental &quot;list&quot; of people we &quot;owe&quot;... George Hayduke has made a living off telling you how to get even! You've seen him and his revenge books, &quot;Get even&quot;, &quot;Get even II&quot;, etc since you were young I bet.<br />I recently got the chance to review ALL of his books. So OK, I figured &quot;Get Even&quot; was great, but the rest would be rehashes of the tricks in his first book... NOT SO! He is undoubtedly one of the wicked and sneaky minded men on earth! I would NOT want to ever be on the wrong side of this man, so OF CORSE I am gonna give him rave reviews! :)<br />These books are very funny, packed full of info, and offer ideas to get your own creative juices flowing. He covers revenge for every subject you can think of, from Ex-spouses and lovers, to big corporation. It's all in there somewhere! Of COURSE these books are for entertainment purposes ONLY! (Let's all say it together now: &quot;If you get caught doing some of this stuff, you WILL go to jail!&quot;) The Down Side:<br />As expected, his first book &quot;Get Even&quot; is a bit outdated in the computer areas, sometimes referring to &quot;punch cards&quot;, but each book is more &quot;updated&quot; than the last. Most of his &quot;ideas&quot; are timeless.	2003-03-14

She met Kate, Cooper, and Annie at an Equinox gathering. She seemed to be starved for acceptance, love, and friendship. She was hard to trust though. After all, she had stolen Annie's spell book and did a spell to steal Scott away from Kate.<br />Soon the three find out that Sasha's whole life story was all lies ... and why.<br />**** In my opinion, book two was much better than the first. It left me with high hopes that the third will be great too! The only thing I did not like was that the book stopped suddenly and left me hanging. I much prefer no cliff hangers when I close a book. However, the story flowed smoothly and the author beautifully described the changes in Kate's life, as well as, how Kate matures. Kate is not my favorite character of the series though. I am hoping I get to see some stories in view-points from Annie or Cooper soon. ****	2003-03-14

Isabela Santana had left Mateo Esquivel seven years ago due to a secret he kept from her, causing a misunderstanding. Now she was a scholar of archeology. She, and her sister Flor, were in Copan to find The Red Lady. Even though Isabela was the best Mayan scholar that Professor Blake had seen in years, he felt Dr. Mateo Esquivel's work on the Hieroglyphic Staircase would be an asset to their dig site. So the couple were thrust together and Isabela's emotions were to be as scrambled as they had been years ago. Mateo's mother, Joanna, had done work on The Red Lady before. Joanna had found proof that there had been a Mayan Queen, in the ancient city's history, and had been killed before she could report it to the Honduran government, or even to her crew. However, Joanna had mailed the map of The Red Lady's location to her son before her death.<br />Mateo knew who the killer was, but could not prove it. When he found out the killer was the chief funder for Isabela's dig, he feared the killer would again murder someone he loved. He had no choice but to enter the life of the woman who had left him so long ago, no matter how she felt about it!<br />As for this story, I have to say that Tracy Montoya has outdone herself! It caught me quickly and held onto me until the end. It is fast paced so its readers will never have time to breathe, much less get bored! Brava!	2003-03-14

His friend, Frank McMahan, was a cop with a loving wife named Mia. Jack was in love with Mia and decided to lead Frank into the gambling fever. Once done Frank would lose everything in hope of scoring on the next hand of cards. Jack was sure Frank would also lose Mia this way and he would be there to snatch her up.<br />To do this Jack needed quick cash. As luck would have it, Jack had B-negative blood, which was hard to find. He turned out to be the perfect HLA match for Sheila Carlucci, the daughter of wealthy Vito Carlucci. If Sheila did not find a donor fast, she would die from Leukemia. So Jack agreed to be Sheila's donor, but Vito would have to give everything he owned to Jack. Jack even found a way to get around the law too. Jack Kathio, the gambler in love, was going for the ultimate prize!<br />**** Here is a fascinating story with an even bigger moral. I won't tell what it is though. Jack is no Hero and Mia is no Heroine, which made this tale unique to say the least! In fact, Jack may very well be one of the most realistic characters I have ever read. The author obviously did thorough research into making this character! I was appalled of Jack at the beginning. Yet as the book continued, my attitude toward Jack, and a few others, did too. I am very happy to recommend this book to the public. I believe Jack will remain in every Reader's mind for a very long time after the last page has been read! ****	2003-03-14

Robert Symington, Marquess of Elston, MUST choose a bride from a list of twenty names within one year, per a codicil in the will left by his father. He travels and meets each lady listed only to find himself horribly disappointed. That changed when he went to meet Miss Karolina \\"Karla\\" Lane, the daughter of the late Lord Padbury who had been a close friend of his own father. However, instead of meeting Karla, Lady Padbury kept pushing her own daughter, Lydia, at Robert. (Lydia is Karla's half-sister.)<br />Robert soon met \\"Catherine Lindquist\\", the governess, never suspecting that Catherine was really Karla. Since the death of Lord Padbury a few years earlier, Lady Padbury had treated Karla awfully. Lady Padbury's only thought was to make a grand match for Lydia. A lavish coming-out was made for Lydia in London and Lady Padbury's sight was set on Robert. However, Lady Jane Blackburn got into the picture to help Robert and Karla along.<br />I believe this book to be worth the whole five stars! Everyone loves tales like that of Cinderella and this one has all the ingredients of one. We have the wicked step-mother who cares only for her own daughter, the prince (or Marquess in this case) who searches for the perfect lady to be his bride, and the heroine, who is treated like dirt since the father died. See? Perfect!<br />Author Susannah Carleton has only written one other Regency that I am aware of. (See \\"A Scandalous Journey\\") Yet even after only two stories she has won me over as a fan! I can hardly wait for her next release. Readers, keep your eyes on this author. I have no doubt that the name of Susannah Carleton will become very well known to all readers of Regencies!	2003-03-14

The reader follows the observant lad through the Naval Academy, his leadership times, and his pirate career. The reader witnesses his true love, Dona Rosalita Santiago, and rejoices with them. Then witnesses his overwhelming tragedies.<br />I often found myself highlighting areas of interest and jotting down notes of wisdom, like the art of foot massage. I found the hero, José Gaspar, to be too pure of mind often, but the life he led was too fascinating to enable me to put down the book.<br />I believe this book to be a must to those who reside in Florida of The United States of America or anywhere in Spain, as well as, all who have interest in the history of pirates.

I found this story to be excellent and the series had remarkable and memorable characters.

She killed not only when her life was in danger, but also to show her strength, such as keelhauling a crewmate when he stole booty from the others.<br />I was very pleased with the ending as well, which I will keep mute about.

Chloe must choose between her Maker and the man she had fallen in love with.<br />**** Pure horror that hits its readers like a punch in the gut! The only disappointing thing, in my opinion, was pages of background of early victims' lives when their sole purpose in the book was to die within a few pages.

But Petra was the most important and she was held prisoner by Achilles! Peter intended to rule the world...and soon. He would become the Hegemon.

His uptown girlfriend, Rebecca, wanted to stop working, get married, buy a large home, and have children. Her parents keep sticking their rich noses into the situation also. Of course, this made the situation worse, especially when her daddy gets Clay a high paying job (thinking Clay would never be able to get a better one on his own) and expected Clay to snatch it up. But Clay refused to be beholden to her family or under their thumb, even if it meant losing Rebecca.<br />Things changed when Max Pace entered the picture. Max became Clay's source to getting several cases against pharmaceutical companies. Clay's settlements would change his life. Then he stumbled upon a conspiracy too horrible to believe!<br />While reading this book I kept being reminded of John Grisham's last novel. I now believe it was foreshadowing this book. There is nothing shocking to the reader here or any unexpected twists. Any reader with a lick of sense will easily be able to predict what is going to happen in the main character's near and distant future.

Today, though, she is going to travel to the land of her ancestors, Ireland, to visit her aunt and uncle and cousins, Michael and Sean, who still live there. Upon arriving in Ireland, Michael has some strange tales to tell, about an old man that only he and Sean (and now Kelly) can see and a stone found just outside the Druid's circle. Something evil has been aroused by Jack Mullen, a man who sees visions, and it looks like it will be up to the three cousins, with the help of elder Hugh O'Donnell to see that this evil is sent back where it came from. Hopefully in the process they can also rescue one of their ancestors who was placed under an evil spell.<br />... This story has much Irish history in it and some of the legends. Once again the author uses an old diary to tell some of the story. The Druid Stone is definitely a book for older teens as there are scenes in this story that would be inappropriate for younger children. This is a spooky story that should keep the reader interested until that last page is turned. I did have a problem with it as it justifies keeping secrets from parents.	2003-03-14

She aced it, but that back fired too. Noticing another name that had checked out the book several times, Annie Crandall. So Kate went to Annie for help. Perhaps together they could figure out how to stop the problems Kate had started in the school.<br />Annie had gotten tired of checking out the spell book, so she bought her own copy at the Crones' Circle, an off beat book shop owned by witches.

So they went to the last name in the book who had checked it out, Cooper Rivers.<br />Cooper Rivers had witches in her family tree, though she would never admit it to others. She reluctantly joined the attempt to correct everything though, with the help of the witches who owned the book shop. All three join forces to cancel out all the spells and end up becoming close friends.

They are businessman and the humans never even know they are different. The third, and highest, are the Arcane Rangers.

I can only hope it happens someday! In this one, Robb MacDaniel's life changes when he goes to law school. He leaves behind his home town, as well as, &quot;the girl next door&quot;. He marries another generous woman named Ellie. As time goes by, Robb's career bring enormous successes and money is no longer a concern. However, soon money is all that matters. Robb never understands that cash in the bank is not the same as owning as much as possible.<br />Belva Plain also shows the effects all this has on Ellie, his two children, as well as the the girl he left behind all those years ago. Surprise ending! The thing I love best about Belva Plain's writing is that she can create a wonderful and realistic story, without using all the harsh language so many other authors use.

However, the title of this one was so unexpected that I found myself giving it a second glance, then a third, and a fourth. Curiosity being a weakness of mine, I opened it. I only wanted to convince myself that, to me, it would be boring. This would put an end to all my curiosities and I could get someone else to review it. Instead, I found myself reading the first page and never putting the book down except to grab a soda.<br />Dr. Alma Halbert Bond seems to share my weakness. She wanted to know why one out of every two marriages ended with divorce. Did the divorced women love their husbands when they married them? Did they marry because they were \\"a couple\\" and family or friends expected them to? Did society press them into it? Did they marry someone like their parents for security instead of love? Was there a connection between an unhappy childhood and a failed marriage? Dr. Bond interviewed 71 divorced women for answers!<br />The book is broken down to several categories and each have sub-categories. Dr. Bond covers:<br />The Physical Abusers, The Verbal Abusers, The Withholders, The Need For Space, The Unfaithful, The Abandoned Ones, The Homosexuals, Married For The Wrong Reasons, The Narcissists, He Changed After We Married, The Control Freaks, and The Good Marriage.<br />All her findings are within these pages! Using her experience of 30 years in psychoanalytic practice, Dr. Bond created a book that people (men or women) should read if they have been divorced, considering divorce, having problems in their marriage, or about to marry!<br />I proudly submit this book to my viewers and consider it to be highly recommended reading!	2003-03-14

Where he tried to be funny about his wife and things they went through, I thought instead he was being utterly RUDE toward and about his wife. He even criticizes his wife when he asked her to look over and critique his manuscript and she left her opinion for him.

He soon realized Gillie was his destiny, his soulmate. He knew Gillie kept many secrets, by omissions, from everyone and that miracles often happened whenever she was around, but he was positive she would reveal all sooner or later.<br />Gillie kept her true identity and Raheiran abilities a close secret. To reveal the truth would destroy the Khalaran society that had already raised generations on her little aphorisms. But when the Fav'lhir attack, after being silent over 300 years, Gillie must find a way to save the Khalaran race all over again! There was simply not enough bottles of Devil's Breath in the station's bars to help her get through it all!<br />Simon is short for \\"Sentient Integrated MObile Nanoessence\\". Via telepathy, one of several abilities she has, Gillie and Simon communicate. As you can see, most of this novel is Sci-Fi. However, the author makes the story more intriguing by adding several touches of Fantasy elements such as a mageline sorceress and a touch of spacestation romance. It all blends together to make an awesome drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat and holding your breath! BRAVA!	2003-03-14

The Ton called him Lord Sin. At fourteen he was wed, by the king's command, to seven year old Lady Christy Macdonald. Neither Sinjun, nor Christy, wanted the match. All Christy's brothers had died in the battle of Culloden. Christy was named laird of the clan Macdonald. She would grow up in her beloved Scottish Highlands at Glenmoor Castle. He would grow up in London and live up to the name Lord Sin.<br />Fifteen years later, there is unrest among the clans. Calum Cameron ruled the Cameron clan. He intended to have Christy and Sinjun's marriage annulled, claim Christy as his wife, and become Laird through the marriage. Then war with the English will begin anew. To stop this, Christy went to London as Lady Flora Randall to seduce her husband. With his bairn in her belly she could return to Glenmoor in triumph! Glenmoor would have an heir, Sinjun would never know Flora had really been his wife and he would live happily in London unawares, and Calum's plans would be thwarted.<br />All went as planned until a pregnant Christy returned home to Glenmoor. Then it all fell to pieces!<br />*** First of a new trilogy! Each will have their own story. This one was MOST EXCELLENT! Connie Mason has never let me down and is still a \\"A BOOK WRITING WOMAN\\" as my mother would say. That is her highest compliment and is seldom given. Lord Sin is as handsome and sinful as they come. Christy is more than his match too. Highly recommended reading! ***	2003-03-14

Devin gave her a birthday card and wrote that if they were both still single at age thirty-five, he would marry her. It was an innocent act of friendship.<br />A couple of weeks before her thirty-fifth birthday, Cara was helping clean out her parents' attic. Her parents were moving to Florida. Her mother, Ruthie, found the card and called Devin. She had decided Devin was perfect for Cara. Besides, if she did not help Cara marry Devin, there may never be any grandchildren. Or worse, Roger might marry Cara. Ruthie could not let that happen!<br />Devin was one of the best criminal lawyers in Manhattan. When Ruthie called, it was the excuse he needed for some much needed time off. He had had Cara on his mind often lately and Ruthie's call was like Fate knocking.<br />As the two spent time together (with Roger down too for a few days), the two do some serious soul searching about their jobs, their lives, and what their hearts truly wish for.<br />**** A wonderful romance where a couple get a second chance at happiness.

Skating pro was the only thing Omunique had ever wanted in her life. Now it all hinged on getting the sponsor of the athletic-wear company.<br />Kenneth Maxwell, Jr., had begun on the wrong foot. He had thought Omunique to be a temporary employee that he had been waiting for. And every second he pushed his foot a bit deeper into his mouth. The family company was all that mattered to him. His whole life was put into the company. But his father dumped the US Olympic Skater contract in his lap only two hours before the figure skater was due to arrive and flew out of town! Hot sparks flew the moment they met! Two hot heads that are attracted to each other, yet unable to let go of their own troubles.<br />WOW! This book has it all, Readers!

This is the third book in a series about young Miranda Stevens and Starlight. Starlight is a two or three year old black stallion that has recently healed from serious leg wounds. Miranda wants nothing more than to own Starlight. It would ensure that the current owner, Mr. Taylor, would not someday part her from the beloved horse. Unfortunately, Starlight is so well recovered that Mr. Taylor is sure the horse can race. He has Adam, his trainer, begin training Starlight. However, Adam is mean to the horse so Starlight keeps bucking him off. Adam believes Miranda is spoiling the horse and keeps taking his anger out, verbally, on her. He refuses to believe Miranda could tell him anything that would aid him in training Starlight.<br />Unknown to most, Miranda had been working with Starlight already. The horse was fully trained and ready to race. But Starlight's heart belonged to young Miranda, who seems to have a natural talent when it comes to handling horses.<br />Very little is mentioned about school or classmates in the book this time. The author focuses more on dealing with the problems of racism. Racism is a very sensitive issue in the world today and Janet Muirhead Hill does an excellent job in showing that skin color does not matter. In fact, the author the shows how petty it makes many adults seem. As in the previous book, Adam and Miranda continue to clash. I believe the author is foreshadowing the next book with this situation.<br />The book is perfect for anyone age eight or up who loves horses. It is clearly written out in a way young readers can easily understand and relate to. This is one exceptional series!	2003-03-14

Knowing the Beetle Kingdom and the SunBirds have joined forces, the Fl-eyes have figured out a way to use the merger against their foes.<br />Author A. A. Browne continues his fantasy series. The first small part of the book is dedicated to recapping the first story in this series. Therefore, if you have not read the first book, you will still understand all that is happening. Yet I strongly recommend reading the first story since it will only enhance the pleasure. You would understand things more and feel like an \\"insider\\".<br />The second book is as good as the first, if not just a bit more so. The story is clearly expressed in a way that even those around age ten will easily understand what is happening. Recommended to all ages!	2003-03-14

Ash had been after Cannon ever since Cannon had murdered his wife and unborn child many years ago.<br />Tamsin was running for her life! Sam had stolen her two thoroughbred horses. She had planned to slip into his stables and [take] them back! She found him dead, [wound] in the back. The Judge, Sam's brother, saw Tamsin running from the stables with two horses and claimed she had killed Sam. Tamsin had witnessed Sam and his brother fighting over a woman just a few hours prior. If he was at the stables at this time of night, that proved HE killed his own brother over a female. But since he was the Judge, she knew she could never prove it or get a fair trial.<br /> Okay, I do not think I gave anything away. I believe Readers will easily figure out who the guilty party is, but that is such a small part of the book that it does not matter. Tasmin is a fabulous character who, I am happy to say, is smart and full of guts! No whimpering and stupid heroine here! I thought her to be wonderful! There is more action than it sounds like too. Toss in some renegade Indians, several outlaws, and even some wild animals. Now THAT is guaranteed action! I am proud to recommend this one to Historical Romance lovers everywhere!	2003-03-14

He believed himself to be God's gift to women and the smarted man alive. But he had a few obsessions. A detective did not believe his wife's death to have been an accident and was constantly around, even if not seen by Enoch. Enoch also found himself murmuring the name \\"Bartholomew\\" in his sleep. Believing Bartholomew to be a threat he made his life's mission to find Bartholomew and kill him!<br />Bart was an amazing child prodigy! Before age three he was reading adult books, Robert A. Heinlein being his favorite! His mother also found out her son was special in another way. Her son \\"knew\\" of parallel worlds. He could \\"walk where it is not raining\\" and remain dry while others get soaked in a down pour. At three, he was found to have retinoblastoma and he became blind. This in no way stopped him though.<br />Angel was adopted by her aunt on the day she was born. Her mother had been black. Her biological father had been white. Celestina, the aunt, was sure that if the father ever found out about Angel, he would hunt her down to kill her. So it was kept quiet. But Angel had an awareness that others did not. She was one of the few like Bart, though they did not know each other.<br />Fate was about to change all their lives!<br />***** Dean Koontz is a master of scaring readers from his tales. This one is not as chilling as some of his previous works, but still an awesome read! Highly recommended! *****	2003-03-14

There is a world beyond it, a better one, called Heaven, which we all long for deep in our spirits. That is the main message of this book. <br />No matter what faith you adhere to, there is the constant longing for more life, but also the longing to go beyond this one, for something more. We seek miracles and other things in endless quests to discover a piece of that in the here and now. Even as we dread death, we long for it, for passage beyond this life into eternity. With that in mind, we should reguard all that is here as temporary, therefore, both more and less important. It is more important because the things that are good are only momentary and can disappear with no warning, yet less important because they are so. Therefore, the painful, irratating, bad things are to be taken as just a brief trial that is refining us for the Kingdom of God. <br />Citing both the Bible and popular media, the author clarifies these and other points in an insightful, easy to understand book that will appeal to a broad range of readers. It is comforting, yet thought provoking and should make the essential library shelf of both Christians and philosophers of any faith.	2003-03-07
