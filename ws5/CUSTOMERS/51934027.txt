Microsoft's release of the MCDST Certification has you taking 2 exams, 70-271 and 70-272.What you need is something to use as a final study tool and this set is just the right answer. What you have here is a fairly complete breakdown of the exam objective condensed for easy reading.<br /><br />No technical manual is usually fun to read since the material is technical, however these 2 books are easy to follow and the reading level is set for the experience technician. Understand that manual(s) is a scaled down finer points set of text, and you will need other resources in order to pass the exam.<br /><br /> The 70-271 book was a little more informative and I found it had information that lapped over to the other exam. As with other EC2 manuals, there is the Cram sheet in front and the cd in the back. This set uses the Measure UP test engine, which could use a few updates and more questions as well as a way to up[date on the web.<br /><br />Fixing the test engine  is a minor draw back and this book should help in the final prep. Overall well put together and researched	2004-09-21

When I first heard of the HTI+ exam I thought it was home networking only and I was wrong. This book covers both HTI+ exams and the  CEDIA installer exam and is written by Ron Glister, whose books I have used for other certification studies.<br /><br />There is an enormous amount you have to know in order to pass these exams and this book seems to have everything right at your finger tips. Judging from the practice questions I have found form pother resources this book is well written for the exams.<br /><br />Laid out to cover all topics form cabling to phones to home security to building codes, this manual takes you from the beginning to the end. After reading this text I found that you not only need to understand and comprehend computers and networking but also home design and construction.<br /><br />This exam tests out 2 very  different skill sets and once you complete the training you are very well rounded in the IT industry. The book doe shave good examples to look  at and work with as well as an excellent set of websites to check out for even more information.<br /><br />As the book covers 3 exams there is also 3 practice exams included and this is the first book on this certification I have seen.

Anyone who has been around computers lately can tell you that spyware, pop-up, adware and other assorted infections is enough to drive you right up the wall. Trying to remove all the problems could become a full time occupation. How does one combat all these nasty problems and still have the computer up and running?<br /><br />Having spent that last several months working on a spyware lockdown, this book has provided some very important information for me to the project. The book does give you a great deal of interesting reading that is written for just about all levels of comprehension.<br /><br />The author has given you a number of ways to configure, install, setup and troubleshoot the various ways to block spyware, spam, the ever annoying pop-ups and even viruses. What this book does is lay out a way for the reader to first take in the concepts and then try it out. As  always you need to make sure you have a backup of the system you will be working.<br /><br />The book does come with a cd that has several demos and even a couple of freeware utilities, although the Spybot and Ad-Aware are out of date since the printing, they are still useful and best of all free.  Overall the book does a good job of informing the user without being over technical and if you are new to computers this might be a good pickup to see what you are in for.	2004-09-21

When I took the 70-270 exam about a year ago I had and abundance of study material, what I didn't have was a final prep tool to study from. This set of books is an excellent final tool but the timing is a little late.<br /><br />Both books cover each objectives and domains for the exam; however the areas of AD and group policies were a bit small as compared to the questions I had on my exam. The information is technically accurate and very up to date with the current exam.<br /><br />There are 2 books in the set and each one has a different set of exam questions, 1 with Prep Logic and the other with Measure UP. Both set of question are right in line with the exam, but I would add more questions to the mix.<br /><br />There are over 1000 questions in total, with over 500 in the Practice Questions book alone.  Again timing is the major drawback and overall this is set of books has excellent explanations for the questions, which makes studying more than memorization.	2004-07-24

I recently became involved in a project to setup a course for the 2 new MCDST exam, 70-271 and 70-272. These new exams appear to give you an entry in the Microsoft arena with out requiring a full blown MCSE track. The book takes the finer points of the objectives and breaks it down in to 9 chapters.<br /><br />The 70-272 exam is focused on the application side of XP and with that this book shows you a lot of customizing, optimizing, configuration and troubleshooting. You'll cover XP, email, Office and the internet and the book includes 2 complete practice exams.<br /><br />The book has a cd rom with the Measure UP testing engine, but there should be more questions included. Overall this should be on the list of material to use in the study process.	2004-07-24

When I first started reading about ICDL I was completely confused by what the certification really was. If fact the name is misleading, International Computer Driving License and it has nothing to do with driving at all.<br /><br />What I found was a compacted set of book for the ICDL exam, and when you pass the 7 modules you have completed what could be one of the most comprehensive set of test out there.<br /><br />Covering Windows and Word, Excel, Access and PowerPoint as well as Mail and the internet, you have to be able to perform tasks in the selected subjects. The exam does not cover FrontPage, Publisher or Project and this should be considered in the future.<br /><br />The books covered over 500 questions and while the smaller book is listed as \\"Review Exercises\\" it is really just review questions. Overall I learned a few new tricks along the way as well as a couple of shortcuts	2004-07-24

Once again is it time to take a serious look at Chris Crayton's latest release for the help you need.<br />In a little over 850 pages there is more than enough information to give you a great chance of passing both the A+ exams. Crayton's knowledge of the subject matter are second to no one and this release is also a technicians dream book as it is packed with troubleshooting and repair information.<br />The book take on both the hardware and the core exams and [resents that material in a manner that would allow any skill level to grasp and understand what is being presented. I like the organization of the book and how the review is spaced out rather than crammed into each chapter.<br />The book has a cd with over 300 practice questions and this may be a little short as compared to some of the other manual out there. This problem can be fixed in future updates or a link on the website to download more questions.<br />Overall this is a very good place to start and if think you are ready than this might and should be the final prep tool.	2004-05-21

A book that captures you from beginning to end and this book had me captured from the start and 4 hours later I was a part of the story. The author has you moving from the start with the rafting trip to the very end.<br />The plot has an agent looking for the killer, and while this may not seem new, wait till you get going and the thrills and suspense will keep you wanting more and more. I found the style of writing to be very easy to pick up, and I am not a fiction reader by nature but this book was something special.<br />There is always something about global espionage, sexy women, power and thrill packed adventure that make this book one of the very best I have read this year. I think with a little work this could be a full length feature movie or possibly something for TV.<br />The main character is a woman and the author calls this books \\"An alternative to Lara Croft\\" and with a name like Kim Blaze, how can you go wrong. If you like fast paced, action packed suspenseful thrillers than take some time to get to know, what should become a household name very soon, Kim Blaze.	2004-05-21

Covering the OSI model, TCP/IP basics and many other topics you have a very good set of questions to work with.<br />I like to use this in the classroom as an added teaching tool. I like the MeasureUp testing tool as the student were given a chance to try the \\"Real\\" test and see how well they do. I also like the testing tool as an interview addition to see what potential employees have for a knowledge base.<br />While the exam has not change very much there is still some material you can pick up in here.

One of the most talked about things in politics is if and when Hillary will run for the White House. Who would know better than someone who has covered or uncovered the Clintons and Hillary over the year than Emmett Tryrell.<br />Tyrell's Magazine, the American Spectator, has given Americans an interesting look into the Clinton White House and Hillary. Tyrell's book delves into the almost forbidden topic of Hillary as President, and his detailed information is simply amazing.<br />Along with Tyrell is Mark Davis, who brings to light things no one else has ever released. These two make an unbeatable pair in exposing the truth of why Hillary wants the White House and what she has and is doing to get there.<br />I was most impressed by how much information is given throughout this entire book. It was a quick read of only 4 hours and it ranks as one of the best insights ever written. Overall if you are looking to see the real sides of the game, than you are ready for this book.	2004-04-15

I know what your thinking, another book on the JFK Assassination and another book for the conspiracy theory, right? Yes and no, yes it is another book on the Assassination and no it is not the typical book; in fact this book has answers not found anywhere else.<br />Having read the author's first book, this follow-up is nothing short of astounding. What the author does here is simply take the evidence that has been used by the Warren commission and show you how they relate to the conclusions. What the book doesn't do is spin anything, everything is right in front of you and you get to decide what is fact what is fiction. Judging form what I have read this may not be as easy at it first appears.<br />You may think you have read or heard everything by now, but keep an open mind and delve into the heart of the book and you may find a few eye openers here and there. It is not just another book; it is so much more and if you are an assassination expert or beginner this book will have you talking, thinking and pondering the issue and evidence all over again.	2004-04-15

The book also shows you what you need to do in order to stand up and be counted. The book is sort of the Conservative Self Starter talking points.<br />So for those who are in the Conspiracy or those who want to be or even those on the edge, this book will take you and guide you through the process.	2004-04-15

Ain't No Rag is the personification of what every American should strive for.<br />Daniels pulls no punches and stops the \\"political correctness\\" in every page of every chapter. Daniels takes on the \\"Elite Left\\" wing, Hollywood, and all those who bash the president. Daniels gives praise to those who deserve it and respect to those who serve this country.<br />If you want a good old fashion helping of common sense and sensibility than get a hold of this book quickly.

The author has really done you a great service in putting everything in one place.<br />Broken down first by the XP , then explorer and the each office application, you have hundreds of faster and easier ways to accomplish tasks.

One of the first books I ever read in the computer industry was Mark Minasi's Upgrade &amp; Maintenance guide 8th edition. From there I was hooked and a fan ever since. Minasi's style is one that makes the reader comfortable with the material without over stating. Minasi dos not over complicate that material so every level of knowledge and skill would be able to comprehend the text.<br />The book is also well suited for several certification exams such ad CST or A+; and the material is technically accurate and up to date. The book covers all hardware topics from the hard drive to add-on cards to networking and everything in between.<br />What the author has done for you  is break down the topics and detailed information that allows you to grasp the concept(s). What I think is missing is a lab manual to go along with the material to make is easier to study from.<br />If you are looking to break into the technical arena, study for the A+ exam or looking to enhance the knowledge base you have, then this book may be one to get a hold of.

One thing I have learned over the passed 15 years is that very few software packages ever come with user guides that are useful. Working with any application is always a challenge and the right help makes everything goes so much easier. The \\"Missing Manuals\\" series has provided some of the best reference manuals out there today and this book is another example of the quality work released by O'Reilly press.<br />The author has proven to be very knowledgeable in the DreamWeaver application arena. I found the book to be easy to read and follow along with and the material fills in the gaps left out by the user manual. The instruction is written to all levels making sure that everyone can use this book and the figures included give a visual learning environment. Now in the updates if color was included this would enhance the learning process.<br />There are a number of step-by-step instructions to follow along with, giving you the opportunity to practice what you read. I think that a there could be more exercises included in the next edition, but what you have is certainly enough to get by.<br />There seems to be coverage of all aspects of DreamWeaver MX 2004 in this book, from the web page to the web site and everything in between. I was able to find answers to several questions I had with the software and I know of several people who have benefited from the book already.<br />Overall this is one great book and for those who need to use the software or those who want to get better you should be reading this.	2004-03-09

The book has the step by step examples and each project has review questions.<br />The book lacks a cd with any tools or examples, although you can get free files from the internet. In updated version this might be something to add. The book takes you from getting the script in web pages to frames and forms.<br />If you new to Javascripting or have a need to brush up on some things, than you may want to get a hold of this book.

In the 15 years I have been involved with computers there has never been a book written that covers the Laptop or portable computer with any real in depth information. That was until now; with the release of Scott Mueller's U&amp;R laptop and this is certainly one to have in every technician's library.<br />The 875 plus page reference manual has just about everything you need to take care of laptop computer, from assembly to hardware and upgrades. The author has certainly taken care of the research as there are a number of laptops covered. The material is very much up to date with the latest information and the technical accuracy of the book is highly evident.<br />The book covers more that what to replace, it takes you through what to look for, what you can and can not do with certain hardware, how to ensure success in the upgrade or replacement and so much more. I have read the U&amp;R PCs and this book is an extension of the material covered there.<br />What is the most impressive part of the package might just be the Cd rom included since it has over an hour of video material that further enhance the learning process. There is material in here that is covered no where else today. Overall this is simply the best book on laptop repair I have read.	2004-01-03

When Cisco revised the CCDA Exam from 640-441 to 640-861, I thought that is was simple upgrade. After taking the beta and live exams, I found that the material on the new exam far exceeds what the old exam had and therefore finding the right material to use will be a real task. Fortunately Cisco Press has done all the work for you and this release is a real help for the new exam.<br />Knowing that formal training for the CCDA exam is hard to come by since the classes are few and far between. So if you are going to self study you will need the best material to study from and this book should fill that need.<br />As with most books on CCDA certification the material is a little dry and sometime long. However the material does in fact cover the exam and cover it well. I found the author to be thorough and detail in the explanations and technically accurate in the presentation of information. The author ability to convey the exam material in straight forward manner is just one of the things I like about this book.<br />I was impressed by the extras the book provides, for example Chapter 11 is a review of the entire book along with a case study. The examples appear to be taken form real life situations. There is a great 11 page appendix covering the OSI model and 20 pages for router and switch commands. At first glance I thought there were no answers to the review questions until I found them all in the Appendix G.<br />Overall the book is well suited for the CCDA exam and do not let the cost sway your decision.	2004-01-03

So any interested in COMPTIA certifications, the A+ has undergone a revision and leave it Mike Meyers to once again lead the pack in creating a great prep tool for the exams. The Passport series is great addition to the material needed to pass the exam.<br />If you are looking for the go to book this is not that book, what this book does is cover each objective by giving you a good overview of the material and pointing out the finer details of the exam. The book is made of the person who is in need of material to make sure they have covered everything before taking the exam.<br /> The book has over 625 pages filled with explanations and pictures, I think that some of the pictures could have been in color to give the reader a better understanding of the material, but it does not detract form the overall presentation of the information.<br />The book is divided into 2 sections, first is the Core hardware and the second is the Operating Systems. The material is technically accurate and up to date so there is no need to worry about studying the wrong information.<br />There is a cd included has practice exam material for the final preparation tool. Couple this book with Mike Meyers All In One Guide and you have the unbeatable combination. Overall since I have been teaching A+ Mike Meyers is the name to trust and this makes studying a whole easier.	2004-01-03

Cisco has broken down the CCNA exam in to 2 separate exams and the 640-811 is the ICND exam. What this book offers you is a decent chance of passing the exam and with other books in the Self Study Series you should do fine.<br />The book does a good of breaking down the objectives and I like the section quizzes, although you could add more questions. The section for configuring switches is also excellent as well as the section on VLAN setup and configuration. What is missing is some sort of simulator to allow you to practice and I think this should be added in any future editions.<br />I found the book detailed and technically accurate with the material that is presented. One thing I have always found with Cisco Press is that the wording in some section is little above the intro level that is associated with CCNA. The author has done a fairly good job of making sure each exam objective is covered, in fact this book can be used for the 640-801 CCNA exam as well.<br />Along with the missing simulator there is no practice exam software either, and with those two things added this book would be a great go resource to have. Overall a few fixes and additions and you should be ready to rock.	2003-12-10

We all know that Mike Meyers is go to man for A+ and that is All-In-One Guide is a huge success and that a great number of people, including myself, owe him a huge bit of thanks for helping us to pass the exams. Now imagine taking the best parts of his guides and break it down even further and that is exactly what has been done here in this book.<br />The book is an excellent study tool for passing the A+ exams as both the Core and OS exam are covered in the 950 plus pages. One thing that could be added in future updates is a few more exercises. And once again as with other books from Mike, this one has material I have not seen anywhere else before. I also found that this book is current with the newest exams, which is another plus.<br />The thing that has always impressed me is the way that Mike Meyers can explain any topic. He is able to convey the concepts and ideas without boring the reader; in fact several students in my current A+ Class have found this manual to clear up some confusion from the study guides we are currently using.<br />The cd included has several practice exams and some videos you can use as additional study tools. The Learn Key Videos does a hardware check before allowing you to run the video demos, which is a good thing since 1 of my machines was not hardware ready. As with the written material, Mike is even better in the video segments with his use of real life situations and examples.<br />If you are just getting started and need a first step in the right direction, than let this book be the pace is all begins. Overall just another superb effort from Mike Meyers.	2003-12-10

Anytime there is an opportunity to enhance my classes with material that will help in passing any certification track then I will be the first to try it. I have read and used material from Chris Crayton in the past in the A+ and Security+, so I can say that the material is technically accurate and up to date. His latest effort is certainly no exception.<br />As anyone knows tackling the A+ certification has the task of passing two exams, one for Hardware or Core and 1 for Operating Systems and the new OS exam has gone beyond all the others. Each chapter covers the objectives from start to finish. Now if you are looking for the be-all end-all book, this is not that book. However if you looking for a prep tool that hits the major points, and nails them on the head than this book is one you need to pick up.<br />The book does have pictures, but they really need to be in color to fully understand what is being asked to point out, overall there are pictures of just about all hardware that is pertinent to the exams. The author has certainly put together a reference manual that will give you a real boost in passing the exam on the first try.<br />One this book also has is the practice exams on cd rom which gives over 500 questions between the book and the cd. Another standout point for the book is the OS section, while most books cover the OSes; this book does a great job on NT, which is lightly covered in most other books.<br />Overall Chris Crayton has certainly done his part with this release, now you have to do yours.	2003-12-10

I have seen instructional videos for just about every sport and I have seen software for every sport. But what happens when you combine both together? You have something that is more than unique, you have the Orchid Educational release of Pool Prof 1 and this may be the wave of the future for learning just about everything.<br />From the technical side of things, this cd was a simple and easy install and there were no complications. I tested the package with Windows 98, 2000, and XP and each installed fine. The game requires a 32X or higher cd and I found that 40X and above work best with the video portion.<br />Once you install the package you have several options, from the learning the basic of the game of Pool to the more advanced trick shots. The videos are easy to follow and very easy to comprehend and the instructors are very personable.<br />One of the things I think the best was this cd goes over the rules of the game, so that the armchair referee can even learn a thing or two. There are even practice drills for you; this is bay far one of the most complete billiards learning tools on the market today.<br />Now just when you think that this just an instructional video package you find that an interactive game is included with the cd.  If you are anything like me you find this game as tough as playing a real game and that makes this the best pool simulator around.<br />Overall, whether you are a seasoned pro or the pool novice, this package ahs something for everyone and for all skill levels - excellent job.	2003-11-27

With the release of the CCNA Fast Pass you can now get that final study session and be ready to go.<br />The book's new name, replacing the Exam Notes series, has the same material you have come to expect from Sybex and Todd Lammle. The book takes the objectives, breaks them down 1 by 1 and gives you the meat the subject.<br />This is the perfect add-on the CCNA Study and Virtual Lab for the 801 Exam. One thing that I like about this book is that even though it is a \\"cram\\" type of reading, there are labs and exercises that you can work on.<br />The book is broken down in to four chapters or areas and each one covers a great deal material. One thing to keep in mind is that this is not the end-all book; you will need other material in order to pass the exam.<br />Also included is a cd with a number of practice tests and overall this is an excellent final review book and well worth the investment.	2003-11-25

As you know this certification has 2 exams, I for hardware and 1 for the Operating systems. This book is a great prep tool for the OS section as it covers several key operating systems and few that aren't on the exam.<br />The book starts off with a hardware overview, which is very helpful in the understanding of software. Then you deal with the older operating systems like Windows 3.X and DOS, this is a nice foundation to learn the roots of the operating system.<br />Then comes NT, 2000, XP and there is even section for the MAC OS and Linux group. What I liked about this book was the exercises and labs; they would prove to very helpful in understanding certain concepts.<br />About the only thing missing is cds with evaluation copies of the operating system(s), in case you don't have access to them. Overall this book is a great compliment to the Mike Meyers All in One A+ Study Guide. As an Instructor, this book becomes a valuable add on to the curriculum.	2003-11-21

One of the most respected names in the A+ and IT industry has to be Mike Meyers; his All in One Study guide is simply one of the best books on the market. Now Mike has gone and released an add-on to the book that will make the learning of the A+ material easier to understand and comprehend.<br />Looking through the book brings back so many memories for me over the past 15 years and reading through the material I found a wealth of information, that I was able to pass on to my A+ classes. From cover to cover the information is nothing short of amazing and takes apart the pc from stem to stern and allows you to put it back together.<br />The breakdown is some of the best classroom material I have ever seen and I have been teaching for over 5 years and A+ for over 4. This book covers the hard drives, including FDISK and Disk Management within NT and 2000. I was hard pressed to find a hardware topic that wasn't covered; there is even material on joysticks and musical instruments.<br />If you are looking for a breakdown of the hardware exam for A+ than you might want to grab a copy of this book. For the instructor out there this book is a great addition to the classroom material. I think that the next release should have a cd with hardware utilities, but overall this is another outstanding effort from Mike Meyers.	2003-11-21

One of the hardest things to learn in the IT industry is how to deal with customers. Learning good skills is often an ongoing process. Learning how to communicate ideas and concepts can often be very difficult.<br />Having run 2 help desks I know that good agents are hard to find. Susan Sanderson has put together one of the few book on help desk that take it from the beginning and give you information that will help in everyday life. I have already found several things in here that I can use in the classes I teach as well as the customers I visit.<br />There are 10 chapters and each one builds on each other. You have practice labs and even review questions. This book can be used as a self paced course or in the formal classroom setting.<br />One of the things I liked best was the cd that is included; this cd has Help Desk Software included for practice. The big plus of the cd is the sample recording of actual calls so that you can hear what the customers is saying and learn several techniques for communicating and listening.<br />Overall this book is very helpful and seems to have just about everything included.	2003-11-21

Becoming a successful network engineer takes several years and lots of hands-on. Getting started requires training and good sources of material to learn from. This book provides and excellent foundation to break into the world of networking and it's from a name you can trust - Mike Meyers.<br />This book covers all the areas of networking from the hardware to the management. You be covering all the requirements of the A+ exam. While the book does talk about the net+ exam, I think you'll need more information and material to pass that exam.<br />I like the pictures of the older network technologies like coax cabling, these areas give a visual learning tool. Also the quizzes and labs are very helpful, as I have already used several of them in my A+ classes. I was pleasantly surprised to see a section on the installation of Netware 6 and Windows 2000 Server; certainly a plus as not too many books like this cover that topic.<br />I found the information to be technically accurate and I was able to pick up a couple of tips along the way. If you are looking for a good starting place than this may be the book for you. I can see this book in several classrooms as an added value to the networking course(s). Overall a good choice for the networking student.	2003-11-21

The material in these updated exam requires the best possible training guide and once again Mike Meyers is leading the pack.<br />Making sure that the material is the most up to date this release is not the first on the market but it one of the best on the market. I had the opportunity to help create practice questions for this book so I can say the material is first rate.<br />Meyer's once again leaves no stone unturned as he covers far more than the exam calls for. His ability to blend humor with knowledge is what makes this book so successful.  Meyers take apart every objective and breaks it down into comprehendible and manageable information; all you have to do is pass the exams.<br />In the over 1100 pages there is the complete exams right before you. This book is one of the first I have seen to cover all the Operating Systems including Windows Me and NT, again Meyers take you beyond the standard cut off point.<br />Meyers has set the bar that all others will have to exceed and judging form the amount of information this is going to be very difficult. One of the things that always impress me is that Meyers gives you the history, this allows you see where things began and how we got where we are today.<br />The cd includes hundred's of practice questions, practice exams and videos to help you study and pass the exam first time. Overall about the only to add is a virtual lab included, however with all that is included this is a very complete package.	2003-11-14

If you have noticed the CCNA exam has been updated from the 640-607 to the 640-801 and who better than Sybex and Todd Lammle to put together the Virtual Lab for you to study with.<br />Based on the hugely successful Router Sim, the virtual lab has everything you need to pass the exam(s) on the first try. Giving you over 80 labs to work on again and again, and if that is not enough then you can always create you own, which makes this an endless training tool.<br />The labs cover everything from basic configuration to WAN install to VLAN configuration. If you need even more labs, than you have the option to upgrade this package to the full Router Sim, although there is a small fee for this.<br />Making a perfect companion to the CCNA Study guide you have all you need to make the grade. About the only thing that this doesn't have a discount voucher for the exam and I can that being added in the next update.<br />Overall Lammle has taken the best training tool and made it even better; this is well worth the price of admission.	2003-11-14

I passed the 640-507 using the Sybex Study guide, I taught 640-607 classes using the Sybex study guide. Now that the 640-801 exam is out, it is only a natural choice to use the 640-801 Study guide from a trusted author and publisher.<br />I had the pleasure and privilege of being one the Technical Reviewers of the manuscript before publication. I found several useful pieces of information in the manuscript add to that the 30 plus labs to work with and this is one of the best guides on the market.<br />The book covers the exam in a logical manner, making this study guide one of the easier to read and comprehend. Lammle's ability to communicate a concept is what separates this book from the pack. There is just about everything you need to work, from practice questions to flash cards, about the only thing missing is the simulator and that has been handled with the CCNA Virtual Lab.<br />If you are looking for the go to source, than look no further.

When I first looked at the book I thought just another PC repair book, I was right and I was wrong. What I found was a very good information for the &quot;real&quot; world as well a helpful tool for the A+ exam.<br />The main text is only about 220 pages so no one topic is coverd to far in depth. Also there is no coverage for DOS or Nt, however Windows 9X, Me, 200o and XP are discussed. The book does a fairly decent job of examining the finer points.<br />I also like the coverage of the hardware side of the PC world, and this book has a good blend of both sides. The amount of information makes this a good prep tool for the A+ exam, although you will other resources.<br />While the books does have some color photos, they should have had all the pictures in color and this could be fixed in the next release. The book comes with a cd with several videos about CPUs, motherboards and other hardware devices. This makes a great add on.<br />One thing that lends real credability tot eh book is the practice questions, which are written by the highly respected Christopher Crayton and based on his A+ test guide. Overall this book is a very good learning tool and needs to be given serious conmsiderationfor the certification study.	2003-11-14

Take the book and give it to someone with little or no experience in the subject matter, have them read and try the material and exercise and see if they understand what they are doing. That's exactly what I did with this book, I had a couple of people with little web design experience try random exercises and they were able to design and comprehend the material.<br />I spent several hours working with the files on the cd and the labs, and when I finished I was well on the way to creating websites. The book uses Notepad as the editor and while this works very well, I used HTML Notepad as my editor and it worked as well. In future release the author may want to include that in the cd.<br />Everything is included from basic tags to frames and forms. You be working with Style sheets to image maps and logos and just about everything in between. This is one of the best classroom books I have ever seen or worked with and in future HTML Class I teach this is going too considered as the book of choice.<br />The cd included has other utilizes for web design as well as all the files need to perform the labs. If you are serious about starting a career in Web Design, than take some time to check out this book.<br />Overall this is simply of the best books for HTML and I highly recommend it.	2003-10-29

In the past year I have taken the CCDA beta and the CCDA live exams. I took the exams to see what changes have been made to one of Cisco toughest exams out there today. What I found out was that the exam is still very tough and they have added a great more material.<br />In this book every exam objective is tackled and each objective is handled with great technical detail. The author has proven to be one of the best resources for the CCDA exam around today.  One of the topics I had trouble with on the exam was IPv6, I certainly could have used this book as reference. The book has about 30 pages and the information is great, I hope in future editions they expand this section.<br />Also the SAFE blueprint and Convergence Technologies are handled very well and the latter section cleared up several questions that I have had for a while. One of the things I liked the best about this book is the pre and post review questions, giving you a chance to find out what you know before you start.<br />The cd-rom has about 200 practice question and I think for the price you should get a few more and a few case studies as well, and this can also be addressed in updated editions. Overall, I think this book should do fairly good job of preparing you for the exam. While the book claims to be a self study guide, you should have some practical hands-on experience before tackling this certification.	2003-10-29

Another thing I have noticed is that in order to be a useful guide the book has to be written in a logical order and have plenty of exercises. This book is a good tool for the new A+ exams.<br />Seeing how CompTIA did not release beta of the exams this time, most books have been release after the exam was out. This book does cover the objectives but in the OS section for example, there is no mention of the ME OS. Also there are over 50 labs, which should provide good material to learn from.<br />Coverage of Printers and networking is very good and I have used some of the materials in my A+ class that I am currently teaching. Another plus for the book is the color photos, about 25 or so of them, something I have not seen in any other A+ book. The color pictures aid in the understanding as you get to see the actual part.<br />A couple of small things to add is number conversions, while the book does breakdown hexadecimal a little bit there is nothing on how to convert form binary to decimal or hexadecimal. Also there is nothing on the electronic parts like resistor, capacitors and transistors and what the schematic symbol looks like and this could be added to the 6th edition.<br />There are a great deal of questions to work with, over 300 in the book and 200 more on the cd-rom that is included. Speaking of the cd, this one comes with LearnKey videos as well as simulation practice questions and flashcards.<br />Overall a decent reference manual that needs a few minor tweaks. If you are looking for a good starting point, either in self study or the classroom, this might be the place to look.	2003-10-29

Now there is Osama Bin Laden, Eric Rudolph and Whitey Bulger making the most sought after group.<br />Throughout the entire book there is details, in some case severely graphic ones, that have you try and see what happened. The book holds nothing back and I was simply amazed at what I read.<br />One thing I like about this book is that you get into the entire asoects of both the victim and the criminals. The stories in some cases strecth the imagination but knoweing that these people really exsist, keeps the storyline well grounded.<br />Overall I found this be not only historical, but also very enlightening as well. The author has also acknowledge several aggents that have fallen in the line of duty and I think that may be the next book they write.	2003-10-13

Included in this book is a cd with a couple of practice exams, 1 for each exam as well as some flash cards.<br />I know that this a fine points study tool, but it think there could be a little more information on each topic as well as more practice exams. Overall a few minor updates are needed, buit this isone good tool to have.	2003-10-13

Secrets so amazing that is will amaze you how close to war we came. There is a deep respect for those who patrol in the \\"Silent\\" Navy and how much they have and had put on the line in the defense of this nation.<br />This book was a bestseller and for good reasons.

I have been working with web page and web design for several years, in fact I have and am teaching a course in HTML. Part of the course is an overview of CSS, and I found this book and the inofmration was simply great.<br />The book not only covers CSS1 and 2 but also CSS3, which is something no other book I have seen has done. In fact this book also gives you a deeper understanding of how CSS is impleneted in several browsers, including Opera, IE and Netscape.<br />Over 800 pages are filled with infomration that breaks down CSS creation in an understandable set of concepts. The author has put together a reference manaul that everyone who creates style sheets should take a look at.<br />You have over 40 pages on fonts and font properties, as well as 90 pages on text properties. The book even covers transistions and filters, another topic that is lightly covered in other books I ahve read.<br />There were topics I have never heard of before like RUBY tags, and some visual effects that are covered as well in this manual. There is even a CCS1 to CSS2 comparison chart included so you can see how they are simliar and different.<br />Overall if you plan to use CSS in your web design, than this book may certainly be the book to have.	2003-10-13

Having taught the new Comptia A+ exam twice already and I am beginning a new class soon, I was amazed atht heamount of information you have to retain to pass. I was also amazed at how books are beiung released for the new exams with any exercises to work with.<br />This lab manual has over 50 labs designed to breakdown the objectives of the ew exam and cover the topics. The labs do require that you have several peices of hardware and software avialable, so I think that this is a perfect companion for any school.<br />The labs for the hardware side are very good, I think that there could be more, but you should have enough for the exam. On the OS side, there needs to be labs covering all the operating systems, 95, 98, ME, NT workstation, 2000 &amp; XP professional.<br />The book is a great companion for the Sybex A+ Study Guide Deluxe Edtion and overall a few updates and additions and this is the go to manual.	2003-09-30

You want to find a book wriiten by a trusted and respected name in the industry. You can all this and much more with the release of the A+ Deluxe edition.<br />David Groth has given us what would appear to be an excellent breakdown for the exam. Being first in this case is a good thing and the material included is more then the objectives and the exam require. As if the expectation would be anything less with Groth.<br />Just short of 1000 pages, this book covers both the exams and has the explaantion in a easy to comprehend manner without over working the information. The author has gone to great lengths to ensure that everyone and anyone reading this book can understand the material, no matter what the technical level.<br />One of the most impressive parts of the book is amount of troubleshooting infomration included. Also the practice questions, of which there has to be more than a 1000 in the book and hundreds more on the cd, are excllent and in most case harder then the actual exam.<br />If that was all you got,then you would have a great start, but the deluxe edition has a second cd with 20 videos that have more hands on exercises. The cds also have bonus exams and flashcards making this one of the best values on the market today.<br />Overall this one great book and if you add the lab manual, then you just might have the best combination around so far.	2003-09-30

Okay you just finished up with the MCSE 200 track and look what Micorosoft does, they release Sever2003 and now you have to re-certify. As luck would have Sybex has released a the 70-290 study guide and you have a great study tool at your disposal.<br />Having had a limited exposure to Server 2003, I found that this book takes you through the software and allows you see what has changed and what has remained the same. One thing that could be added to the next release is a evaluation version of server 2003.  I have found that working with the real thing is an added study tool.<br />The book seems easy to follow and it has pleanty of exercies for you to work with. If you have the software to work with you are all set. If you don't, fear not, as Sybex has included a 2003 OS simulator. The software simulator, I found to be a very nice addition to the book as it gives you a feel for the real thing.<br />There wer a couple of new things I was able to pick up, one is the Shadow copies and the other was the information about Terminal Services. The book is laced with excellent review question, as is the CD. The cd includes flashcards, but both seem to handle the exam objectives without missing anything.<br />Overall I think this book should be a real value for the new exam.	2003-09-30

Ever heard the saying \\"It gets better with time\\", this could be the phrase to describe the 15th edition of one the best compture technician manuals ont he market today. Scott Mueller has released the latest edtion of Upgrading and Repairing Pcs and this is the best one so far.<br />I have using theses books since the 9th edition and each time the new book is released I find even more information and always find the book(s) to up to date and techincally accurate. I am teaching a class in A+ and this is certianly a reference to have handy for the students.<br />There is over 1500 pages covering it all, from Motherboards, CPUs and memory to storage, networking and troubleshooting and just aout everything in between. Mueller has become a highly repsected and trusted author and this book bears out his great technical abilities. Anyone in the technical field needs to have this book as part of thier library.<br />The techincal details, from pinouts to slot pin breakdown is nothing short of amazing and the amount of information is simply incredible. There is information in this book that I have not found anywhere else.<br />While this book is not written to any single certification exam, you will find that it is tailored to the A+ or CST exams. The book includes a DVD with 2 hours of video clips to learn from. The only thing I found was that if you don't own a DVD player you have top go tot he website to download the clips, I think a CD should be included for those without DVDs.<br />Overall this is simply a must have for any and all field and depot technicians. Those working a Help Desk shouldhave a copy at the right hand. Mueller has simply outdone all other editions.	2003-09-28

Indianapolis, the Navy's Greatest Sea Disaster	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Some of the best reading this year	Several years ago I read a story abut a high school student whose research was directly responsible for the overturning of a court martial. I then saw a movie with Stacy Keach about the sinking of the BattleShip Indiannapolis. After that I was very interested in finding out more about the \\"Ship of Doom\\".<br />Now having spent 6 great hours devouring every page of this true and gripping novel, I am certain that the miscarriage of justice has been righted. This book is as good as it gets, and for those who have ever served in the Navy, you'll be strolling down memory lane as they book details life aboard a ship.<br />The book is a true testament and record to those who died and thos that lived. The book is a compelling look at the disaster, how the crew was affected and what happened to everyone, including the captain.<br />Using actual testimony fromt he court martial, you have a first hand, inside look into how a chain of events can be looked at from several view points. If you are a histry buff, a Navy vet or anyone who loves a good mystery, than this book is certain must have and must read.<br />Overall you'll be hard pressed to find any better work and this one gets my highest praise and recommendations.	2003-09-22

The Valachi Papers is the book that set the Mafia on its heels and allowed the world to see and finally get a look into the \\"real\\" underworld.<br />By far one the best reads I have had this year and certainly a must read for anyone weho thinks they know what the mafia is all about. This is the book that started it all and gave me my start into a whole world.<br />What this book does is tear down the walls of mystery and open your mind to new ideas about the mob. The book shows how it happened and what took place. Due to some of testimony being somewhat graphic younger reader may want to take caution before they begin the book.<br />The book is far better than the movie and knowing that this was told by someone on the inside makes it all that more exciting to read. Overall if you want to know where it all began, than look no further that this book.	2003-09-22
967625:US	51934027	R2M712K19EO2B4	0060096616	315049590	The Worm in the Apple: How the Teacher Unions Are Destroying American Education	Books	5	16	20	N	N	This should make parents sit up and take notice!	Having graduated from High School over 20 years ago, I am simply amazed at the amount of money poured int he classroom and yet the quality of education doesn't seem to be getting any better. After reading this book I can understand why that is and if your a parent, you may want to sit and take a serious look at what this book has to say.<br />The is one book that will blow the lide off the teachers union and the NEA, as it brings into the light the hidden agendas and the political maneuvering that goes on behind the scenes. It shows how money for the schools get directed to unions, teachers and school boards and what ever is left over is then given to the schools. After reading this I now know why taxes go up and  up.<br />The book shows how the unions asking for more money, all the while allowing teacher to do less and less. The book explains how SAT and other test scores have been in decline for years and yet little or no reform is on the way.<br />You'll find that the Elite Liberal Left is working with the Unions to eliminate \\"true\\" school choice. You'll also find how teachers and the unions have spent years fighting against the retention by results or merit rating system, because they know that alot of jobs would be lost.<br />I was simply amazed at what this book uncovers and know that there could have been twice as many pages and still not given all the facts. This is one of the best documented and researched text I have seen on this subject.<br />Now I know there are a lot of teachers who do a great job, I also know that there is a shortage of good, quality teachers. And I also know that most teachers are way underpaid, however after reading this book you have to wonder if the unions aren't to blame.	2003-09-22

About 3 years ago I was teaching a CCNA Class when I discovered Richard Deal had practice test at Boson.COM. I have been a true fan ever since and was eagerly awaiting this release for the new CCNA exams.<br />One thing that has always impressed me about Deal is that he goes far beyond the exam requirements giving you the best chance to pass the exam on the first shot. This 800 plus page book covers all 3 CCNA exams and the book and the add-on cd you have a first rate study tool.<br />Seeing how the new exams now covers even more topics than previous exams and can be taken in 2 sperate exams, it is good to see that this book shows you the best way to make excellent use of the material based of the exam you are planning to take.<br />The cd has a limited edition of the Boson NetSim and there are a number of labs in the book that coincide with the simulator. I think that if you need more labs than you should go to Boson.COM and purchase the full version.<br />There are also practice question ont he cd, coupled with what is in  the book you have over 750 questions. Knowing Richard Deal, I am sure that there will be more practice exams for sale at Boson.com, which would add even greater value tothis book.<br />2 utilites that come with the book, the subnet calculator and the config register, will be highly useful in real life. While they are not allowed in the exam, they will be extremely handy to have around when you begin working on your network(s). A couple of things to add to the next edition, first a few more labs, since I think more is always better. Second the NetSim be a full version allowing to study beyond the exam.<br />Overall if you are serious about the new CCNA exam, than here's a good place to start your training.	2003-09-16
995793:US	51934027	R1O1KFCIV1K9KY	0789728176	351281747	Upgrading and Repairing Networks (4th Edition)	Books	5	8	8	N	N	4th edition is another great release!	Anyone in networking needs to keep up to date with the changes in technologies and doing this requires constant reading of the latest material. Trying to keep up could very well be a full time job, so thank goodness that Terry Olgetree is around to make it a little easier for all of us.<br />Having had the opportunity to read the 2nd and 3rd editions, this 4th edition is a continuation of the outstanding work Olgetree is and has done. The books get better with each edition; in fact this is a perfect companion for several networking certifications.<br />In 1200 plus pages, you are taken from the history of networking right up to migration. Olgetree starts you with hardware and works to security applications. You are working with Windows, UNIX, Linux and Netware, so everyone is involved.<br />From the opening of the book; which has a very good subnetting chart, to the closing, which has Ethernet information, this book takes apart the network and helps you put it back together. Form the LANs and WANs to IP and IPX, you have protocols and the information is up to date and technically accurate.<br />The book does covers troubleshooting in a how to and why it happens and what to do manner, which I found to very helpful. In fact I was able to learn a few new tricks along the way.<br />Overall this is one of the best network reference manuals to have around, in the next edition there could be a cd-rom with a few networking utilities.	2003-08-28

Overall a very good tool coupled with the Cisco Press CCNA Intro and ICND books.	2003-08-22
1002965:US	51934027	R38Q4DUNWZDM8F	158720083X	457013629	CCNA ICND Exam Certification Guide (CCNA Self-Study, 640-811, 640-801)	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Does work the for the ICND exam.	Once Cisco decided to split the CCNA exams into 2 separate exams, I wasn't surprised to see the release of 2 separate books, one for each exam. This release covers the 640-811 or ICND exam.<br /><br />Having used Odom's book in several classes I am familiar with his style and find that if you are in need of a text that goes beyond the exam then this would be an excellent choice.<br /><br />This book is solely concerned with the configuration of the switches and routers; his INTRO book covers the other exam. In this book the coverage of the LAN Switching is second to none.<br /><br />Also with the new additions to the new exam, Odom makes sure the each is covered, such as OSPF and EIGRP as well as Router security. One thing I have found with Odom's books is that they tend to be written to the intermediate level, so beginners will have to do a little more work, but for the serious candidate this should be no problem.<br /><br />As with the INTRO Book this one includes a LE Version of Boson's NetSim, which you can turn into the full version form the Boson website. Overall Cisco Press and Odom may want to consider combining the books, as cost is a driving factor in the certification game. Aside from that this should be a very useful tool.	2003-08-22
1003134:US	51934027	R3RPSPCXP44D7D	1587200945	671077177	CCNA INTRO Exam Certification Guide (CCNA Self-Study, 640-821, 640-801)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	If you are ready to become a CCNA - start here.	You know by now that you could take just one exam, 640-801 and become a CCNA. But what if you haven't enough experience or want to be able to break down the studying, well then taking one exam at a time maybe just the answer.<br /><br />This book is the INTRO or 640-821 exam which covers the networking fundamentals all the way up to the actual router configuration, which is the other exam.<br /><br />One thing about Wendell Odom is that he usually goes beyond the exam and this book is certainly no exception to that rule. In fact his coverage of switching from layer 2 through layer 7 is more than the exam, but then again isn't that what you really want.<br /><br />As usual the practice question in the book are much harder than the exam, another plus for Odom. One thing that is new is the addition of a router simulator, albeit a scaled down version of the Boson NetSim.<br /><br />Having spent some time on working with the full version, the LE Version should provide enough material to cover the exam and help you out. If you need the full version you can always go to Boson's website and purchase it.<br /><br />Finally, while there is also over 300 practice questions, for the money being spent I think that there should be a more to work with. Overall it seems to be a very good book to work with.	2003-08-22

In 1865 President Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, this is commonly known by most people. But what is not known is that there were eight others who had a part in the conspiracy to kill the president.<br /><br />Unlike the other books I have read on the subject; this one has very little plot, in fact the book spends more time talking about the trial rather than the events leading to the assassination. Rather the author has put together the actual court transcripts of the testimony against each of the conspirators.<br /><br />After reading the text, which took about 5 hours, I learned more about those involved and even found out a few new things along the way. I found the discussion about Dr. Mudd so intriguing I spent several hours on the internet reading about him.<br /><br />I found the book well documented and researched. The author has certainly seemed to leave no stone unturned. Overall this book is the best overall presentation into the murder and conspiracy I have read so far.<br /><br />If you are looking for serious information about the Lincoln Assassination or just wondering what happened than this book is the place to start looking.	2003-08-22

Recently I was doing some consulting for a company and performing a Windows XP Professional Rollover and upgrade. I was also teaching a class for A+ and the new objectives which has XP questions. This book while not a certification specific book, handled both jobs very well.<br /><br />What this book is is more than how to configure the desktop and change the background or setup XP to look like the \\"Classic\\" windows interface. While it does all that it also takes you through security and networking and what I found to very interesting is that it discusses the Home and the Professional versions as well as the 32 and 64 bit versions.<br /><br />There are step by step procedures throughout the book to help you learn to perform different operations, such setting up the ASR process, dual booting Windows 9X and XP and how to do searches for people, computers and more.<br /><br />There is a great deal of pictures and diagrams in the book; however I think that some of them need to be in color in order to completely understand the full meaning the photo.<br /><br />There is also a cd included which has an additional chapter that the book does not cover. It also has over an hour of video to show you how to perform certain technical functions.<br /><br />Overall the book is very comprehensive and for those wanting to add to the knowledge they have or possibly use this book for certification exams you have a very good source of information.	2003-08-22

Single Bullet fired by Lee Harvey Oswald? Conspiracy of many like the CIA? Exiled Cubans looking for revenge? Powerful Mafia figures mad about RFK?s prosecution of the mob? All of the above? None of the above?<br /><br />For almost 40 years these and so many other questions remained unanswered and all the government is saying is in the Warren Commission Report. So where do you stand on the report, do you believe it or is it a complete whitewash of the facts?<br /><br />In the over 600 pages of this text I was amazed at what Remington was able to find and uncover. His attention to detail and meticulous work is some of the best reading on this subject I have encountered in the 40 plus books I have read.<br /><br />Remington takes each piece of evidence the Warren Report has and gives you what works, what doesn?t, what makes sense and what is beyond common sense. Remington has put together a masterful piece of work that certainly rivals any other manuscript out there today.<br /><br />Whether you are a \\"lone gunman\\" type, or the \\"SBT\\" believer or even the newbie, keeping an open mind, examine the evidence and facts and you will find yourself looking at the while situation in a new light.<br /><br />This book should have those in Washington taking notice and finally doing the right thing and releasing all the information. Until then Rodger Remington has certainly given us a most gripping look into the report that has been the center of one of the longest running debates in American History. Very Well Done and Congratulations!!!	2003-08-19

Every now and then I get a chance to take a break from the usual technical manual and I get to review something outside the computer industry. If you looking to get away for a while with a story that has you moving from beginning to the very end then take a look at The Kill Clause.<br />Never having heard of, much less read, anything by Gregg Hurwitz, I was most impressed by the way the author spins the story line. I was kept guessing throughout the book and even had a few unexpected moments which I found made the book one of the best works I have read to date.<br /><br />The thing I found that made this a real grabber of a novel was the way the story unfolds and how I found myself thinking \\"This could have happened to me.\\" and \\"What would I do in that situation?\\"<br /><br />You are given an insight into the world of the U.S. Marshall and the author's ability to make the story believable without going overboard is what sets this book apart from the rest.<br /><br />The storyline calls out for the big screen without a doubt. If you like the fast paced, action packed and intense plot then this is just the kind of book you want to get a hold of. Overall an excellent job and I will be watching and waiting for the next novel from Gregg.	2003-08-19

There are certain things about Sybex that have always impressed me, first and foremost is the quality of the books they release. I had the pleasure of working on this book as a galley reviewer so I got to see the quality up close.<br /><br />The book is a great study tool as it gives you the right material to pass the new and extremely difficult CCDA exam, 640-861. Having taken the exam live and in Beta, I found this book to cover each objective in a manner that is both easy to understand and also technically up to date.<br /><br />Lammle is once again at the top of his game as he has put together one of the best book around. From the introduction to networking, to VLAN layout and design to the more complex design issues and management the book is a great tool both for the exam but also after.<br /><br />The book is complimented with a cd with practice questions. While this book does not have a simulator, in fact I have never seen a CCDA simulator; this might be something for the author to consider adding to the next edition.<br /><br />Overall a great tool and very useful text - well done.	2003-08-08

Usually when a book is release as a 2nd or 3rd edition, the publisher is just updating the content to reflect the new features or releases of the software. This book is just that and a little bit more.<br /><br />This book takes apart the XP operating system from stem to stern and everything in between.  Taking it from the deployment to remote users to desktop configuration.  In most case that would be enough, but here's where the book is updated.<br /><br />Adding over 200 pages on security, you will find that book is far more than a Resource kit, it may also be used as a study guide for the 70-270 exam.<br /><br />The cd was also updated with over 120 utilities and a couple of e-books, including the entire text in e-book format. Another thing I liked about the text is that throughout the book there are step by step procedures to show you hoe to configure, manage or administrate different parts of the OS.<br /><br />Overall I have been able to use this in my job several times within the past 2 months with the XP upgrade I was involved in. I am certainly glad to have this in my technical library.	2003-08-08

I installed Acrobat 6 and began working on a project. I thought it would be like working with a typical word processor, how wrong I was. I am glad I was able to use this book to point out how there is so much more Acrobat does.<br /><br />I found out how to integrate Acrobat with Office, how I can create PDFs in Acrobat and how Acrobat works in creation of web pages and websites.<br /><br />The book has a wealth of information on conversion from one format to another, multimedia, printing and something I never knew you could do create search queries.<br /><br />The book has taught me several things in a short time frame and overall I found this book very useful.	2003-07-30

Ever since the CNWA announcement, I have searched the internet for all study material. I have taken practice exams and even downloaded the only \\"study guide\\" I could find, that was until now.<br /><br />This release seems to be a good source of information as it is written by the CTO of Planet3 Wireless, the creator of the CWNA exam. Having read other material from Devin Arkin and then reading this book I think you'll have a great chance of passing on the first try.<br /><br />Written to the introductory level of technician this book gives you a complete breakdown of the exam objectives. Arkin makes the reading easy to follow along, but at the same fills the pages with detailed explanations.<br /><br />While the book does have over a hundred practice questions, I think for the money a cd should have been included with practice tests. Overall, while a little pricey, it may be worth the buy for the CNWA cert	2003-07-13

Remember how the Supreme Court sent the Florida Supreme Court a message to do the right thing?<br /><br />Think you know what really lead to the Bush Victory Celebration? Think you know how the election was decided? Then you need to read this book and find out the missing information and fill in the gaps of what the media told versus the reality of really happened.<br /><br />I spent just over 4 hours reading and re-reading what the Gore machine tried and failed to do. How they thread to tie up the election process and how political ambitions finally caused the Democratic Party to split.<br /><br />The book covers the \\"Republican Juggernaut\\" and its movement through the entire election, from the first re-count to the final decision from the Supreme Court.<br /><br />Read how the Highest Court decided, in a 5 - 2 vote not the 4 - 3 vote reported by the media, finally put an end to the whole situation, that had a nation wondering for weeks.<br /><br />Overall the author puts together a look into the politics of Washington and this is one great read.

David Groth and Sybex have teamed up to give you an updated text for Network+ and thrown in a lab simulator to make the chance of passing the exam first time better than ever before.<br /><br />I found that the OSI breakdown is not only perfect for Network+, but also the A+ class I am teaching benefits from it as well. Groth also has a great 200 pages for TCP/IP, again the explanation is written for all levels making a perfect learning and teaching tool.<br /><br />Once again the text is technically up to date and accurate. The team has certainly done everything here including hands-on labs, practice questions, tips and tricks.<br /><br />There are 2 cd included, one with practice exams and the other with the simulator.

One thing about certifications and study guide I have seen over the years is he who gets there first is the book that most people choose. While this is the generally accepted rule, rules do have exceptions.<br /><br />Having worked on and currently working on Security+ material, this book is objective complete. Greg White, the author, has an excellent grasp of the material. He uses excellent examples and note to illustrate his points.<br /><br />For he most part the book is detailed, I was especially impressed with the Cryptography section and the algorithm breakdown. I have never seen this in any book before.<br /><br />There are certainly a good number of practice questions both in the book and on the cd-rom, and they appear to have the exam covered. Overall the book is a good source of information; timing is the big issue here.	2003-07-13

As a Technical Computer Instructor, I have certain book sitting on my desk all the time, as reference guides. Now that I am teaching several A+ classes I have another book that will be right out in front with others.<br /><br />Over 14 years in this industry and certain I have found certain names to be trusted with producing high quality material; Stephen Bigelow is one of those names. High work in this text is first rate, and while this book doesn't cover or is written from any specific exam, I can see this book being used for A+ and CST and CNCT exams.<br /><br />One thing that has always impressed me about Bigelow's work, and this book is no exception, is the vast number, over 1000 diagnostic symptoms to learn from.<br /><br />There is so much troubleshooting information, not only for Intel, but also AMD and what is truly noteworthy is the fact that the book is so technically up to date with the material is covers.<br /><br />The cd included has a number of tools and utilities that could be useful. Also there is several appendices, of which is a DLS Technician 4 Exam. While this exam is not an \\"Industry\\" recognized exam it is worth the $50.00 to take.<br /><br />The DLS4 exam is an excellent tool to measure your understanding of the material in the book.

Gun Control has become a major political issue and usually a political weapon during election years. Whether you agree with gun control or agree that the second amendment has taken a real beating from the liberal groups, this book should provide a more in depth insight into why the things you read in the papers, see on TV and hear form some liberal politicians is not quite everything you need to know.<br /><br />Having read the author other book \\"More Guns, Less Crime\\", I was intrigued by how well the author defends his positions on guns, gun control and gun lobbyists. I was even more impressed by the arguments and the facts to back them up this book contains.<br /><br />What the author has done is take on the establishment and show that the media, the left and the PACs have distorted, obfuscated and demagogue the issues, leaving the people confused and in most cases scared.<br /><br />As a parent I am concerned about the weapons and guns and this book is tremendously compelling, showing that banning, limiting, controlling of weapons, including automatic and assault, hasn't lowered or decreased crime, in fact the opposite has occurred.<br /><br />Lott is very well researched  and very well documented. He states his case with a great deal of confidence and after reading the text I find myself agreeing with just about everything. I found that the book confirms the statements \\"It is not the gun that does the damage, it the person using the gun.\\" Overall - well done!	2003-07-02

Having worked in the IT industry for over 14 years, and having worked in the classroom for over 5 years I am always looking for new material for the students. Sybex has made a reputation for releasing first rate material in the Cisco certification arena and this book is no exception to that rule.<br /><br />In over 1000 pages every CCIE Routing and Switching Exam objective is covered and explained. I found the authors to be not thorough but also very detailed. I also found that the material, while complex and highly technical, to written to a level that is intermediate rather to than advanced or expert level.<br /><br />One thing I notice was the book covers the written and lab exams, this is the first book I have seen like this. As it comes with several labs to practice with and hundreds of practice questions you have what appears to be a complete study guide.<br /><br />I found that Chapter 8, especially the CIDR and VLSM, explanations were very well explained and it cleared up a couple of questions for me. The cd, as with other Sybex books, has the e-book and practice exams included. Overall I think this a one to look at for those going or the CCIE R&amp;S certification.	2003-07-02

Are you a Conservative? Do you think the previous administration was completely out of touch? Are you glad to see a change in Commander's-In-Chief? Or are you tired of the same old re-hashing of the Clinton misuse of power stories? Well either way you may want to check out this book to see what did or didn't happen and maybe you views may be readjusted.<br /><br />Written by someone on the inside, I found the book compelling, easy to follow and hard to put down. I also found that some of  the stories a little hard to believe as they seem to stretch the line of reality.<br /><br />Does the book bash Clinton - not as much as I thought it would. I did see the author makes persuasive arguments to show how the administration failed to live up to the oaths they took, but again some of the arguments seem a little too far over line.<br /><br />The author is well documented and well explained as well as well informed. He shares his views with a nation in this book and does a great job articulating his point of view(s). I think that the more conservative reader would finds this book enjoyable, however anyone with an objective look would find it a great read as well.<br /><br />Overall the author has written a convincing piece and with a little work this has the \\"movie\\" just waiting to come out.	2003-07-02

When I got this book I thought this was a simple case of the conservative bashing the left. I thought the author was just another right-winger looking to sell books and after reading the book I found that the author does bash some liberals and the left but the evidence is convincing and hard to let go by without a second look.<br /><br />Charen takes on and tackles the left, and stands tall with some of the most unbelievable stories I have read so far. I found the reading to be both enjoyable and as well as thought provoking. The lays the way liberals think and how they let their own agendas affect the political decisions that they make or made.<br /><br />Charen gives a good insight into the how the left travels and what they feel is important and what they think the people want. I think that Charen does go a little overboard in some of the stories, and in a couple of cases begins to attack the person.<br /><br />One thing you need for this book is a very open mind and the willingness to look at things objectively. If can put personal politics aside and serious consider the facts in the book than you may be able to see the author's charge here.<br /><br />Charen appears to present a  clear, honest and precise argument(s) to show what the right has done in order to counterbalance the left's misuse and misguidance. Again there are a couple of areas that border on the \\"bash\\", but the overall text is an excellent read.<br /><br />Looking for change of pace in the political arena then take a look here. Well Done!	2003-07-02

In the political world there are conservatives and then there are liberals. Some times it is difficult, even impossible to know where someone stands, this is not the case with Ann Coulter. She has become a great voice and influence in the conservative political arena.<br /><br />Over the past several months a number of books have come out \\"bashing\\" the left, most since 9/11. Most of them stating that the Liberal Democrat elite have missed the boat on the issues and most of the books do nothing but \\"bash\\" them. So why then is this book different? Why then is this book making the news?<br /><br />Ann Coulter, who has already put together 2 other books, has taken the issues, one by one, broken them down and with documented evidence shown that the left has missed the boat on many of them.<br /><br />Does she bash the liberals? In some cases very hard, and in others not at all. Coulter takes the Left to task and put the facts in front of them, there is no doubt as to where she stands and this conviction is what makes this book such a compelling read.<br /><br />I was impressed by her straight forward, no holds barred approach and her unwillingness to leave the core beliefs. So gives no ground and if you look at all the facts and evidence you may start tot think twice about what needs to be changed.<br /><br />Coulter's work is first rate, leaving no stones unturned in pursuit of the truth. While the liberals may find it hard to swallow the information, the work is complete and well organized. Overall an excellent job!!	2003-07-02

I love history and over the past several months have been reading more and more books on U.S. History. I found this book to be a fast read and be entertaining at the same time.<br /><br />Like the other in the series the book is limited to 101 questions, and I found it to be written to a younger crowd, although there were a few questions that caught me off guard.<br /><br />The books covers most American conflicts and wars, but remember there are only 101 questions so it will not delve too deeply to any one area. Overall very good for those wanting to learn about the past.	2003-06-24

Over the past several months America's involvement in Iraq has created a stir throughout the entire nation. One thing that has presented itself over the past several months is the question of why we are involved in Iraq.<br /><br />William Bennett has tackled this question with this book. Bennett has certainly laid out a foundation of reason for the need to take on those that pose a threat to national security and those that use terrorist tactics to destroy.<br /><br />Bennett pulls no punches as he skillfully draws the picture that patriotism is stronger now than ever. He brings out the strongest arguments to show that sitting back and waiting can only lead to further disaster.<br /><br />Bennett's arguments are rationally discussed and the positively backed up with evidence. Bennett takes on both side of the argument, showing we the administration has failed and where is has been strong.<br /><br />Overall, whether you like Bill Bennett or not, keeping an open mind while reading this book will certainly show you a few new things and open you up to new ideas. So whether you are liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican, this book does shed new light on what makes this country what it is today - great!	2003-06-24

Another installment to the Great American History Quiz series of books and like the others there is only 101 questions to work with. The book I found was more trivia type of questions rather than questions about History specifics.<br /><br />As with other book in the series, there is no pictures and for the young readers this may be a drawback as something are better identified by sight.<br /><br />Overall a good book for those rainy days when you need something to read or that car trip.

This book has allowed me to go back to my childhood and relived some of the greatest moments.<br /><br />The book starts off from the4 very beginnings in 1876 through the 2000 season and the travel is a great time, as I was able to read through the entire text in just under 2 hours.<br /><br />From the early days with Ed Delhanty, Billy Hamilton, Sam Thompson, Duffy Cooley and Elmer Flick to the 50's Whiz Kids with Robin Roberts, Jim Bunning and Richie Ashburn all the to the great teams of the 70's and 80's with Schmidt, Carlton and even today with players like Schilling, Rolen, Hollins and Daulton there is a story for everyone.<br /><br />Read about the bad trades, the mangers, the end of season collapses and heartbreaks to the World Series win in 1980 and the losses in 1983 and the dramatic loss in 1993.

We have had 43 presidents and I am sure that a book could have been written with thousands of questions about them, this book only has 101 and I was amazed and how tough they were.<br /><br />The other books in the series seemed relatively easy compared to these questions. The only thing I saw was that there was no pictures of the presidents and this should be a part of the book.<br /><br />The book does provide some new material and from the reading I don't think there was a question on each president. Overall another good book to add to the reference library.	2003-06-24

Along the Washington beltway there is always something new happening and just when you think it's politics as usual that's when the tables are turned and the most unexpected things can happen. Michael Bowen has certainly proven to me that he has the understanding of what happens in Washington and how the political game is played.<br /><br />The book is more than a \\"might be\\" story this is look into the realm of high possibilities. Starting off on September 3rd and using the current political layout Bowen takes you on a journey that while you may think that it's a  \\"pro\\" Hillary Clinton novel, it maintain a realistic objectivity from beginning to end.<br /><br />Bowen's walk through the Democratic political machine is nothing short of incredible, watching the plot unfold you'll see Hillary Clinton battle former friend Al Gore for the nomination from the primary season right to the Democratic national convention.<br /><br />You'll walk through the camps, see the press reaction and deal with Congress all the while having to remind your self this book is a futuristic tale. See how Hillary tackles the familiar Republican war cries of taxes, civil rights, abortion, health care, domestic and foreign policy and war and how her spin machine is ready for anything.<br /><br />A masterful job of putting together what could happen with what is happening and even a few surprises along the way. I found this compelling to say the least and powerful and gripping to say the most, Bowen has mastered the talk of Washington and tone of the political climate.<br /><br />Once you are hooked and ready to see what happens in the first 100 days, you'll find it's liberal politics as usual, but you may fins the first state of the Union address a little surprising. One this is certainly for sure, whether you are the most staunch Republican or the most steadfast Democrat, whether liberal or conservative, this book is a must read for any and all political junkies.<br /><br />Overall one of the best books I have ever read and I can see this book moving to the silver screen.

Network Security is becoming the most sought after position in the IT world these days, yet in order to get these jobs you need to be certified. There are over 20 possible security certifications so where do you start?<br /><br />How do you determine which exam to take and which certification is right for you? Well you might want to start with the CompTIA Security+ vendor neutral certification. Now all you need is the right study material and that is where this book comes in.<br /><br />With over 600 pages of material covering every exam objective this book has good coverage of the material. I think that certain areas such as PKI management could be expanded just a bit.<br /><br />Also the practice questions were close to the actual exam, and I think that more should be added. The author certainly has an excellent understanding of the material and evident throughout the book.<br /><br />With the ever changing world of Security, this book should have regular updates, either via the web or a new edition of the book. Also included is a Prep Logic cd, while Prep Logic does produce a high quality product this is not the full version of the product. Although for the money it should have been included.<br /><br />Overall this book is a useful tool outside the exam and you stand a decent chance of passing the exam. Couple this book with the Exam Cram2 Security+ and you have a better chance.	2003-05-30

In my quest to pass the 70-214 exam I had very little material to work with and even less to practice with. Sybex has released a book with over 80 exercises and 200 practice questions that will certainly making taking the 214 exam a little easier.<br /><br />First let me say that the 70-214 exam is by far the toughest exam I have passed or taken, this book is written by 2 people who certainly have an in depth understanding of the world of Windows 2000 Security.<br /><br />Taking you on a path that starts of with the basic of group policy configuration and works you all the way through the updating and management of the security system, including auditing, you have a very complete study guide to work with.<br /><br />The coverage of the certain areas like the MBSA is great and the exercises make it easier to understand the use and purpose of the utility. I found the question to be very close to the actual exam, but I think more case study type of questions should be included as a separate test prep section.<br /><br />The cd include also has a great number of questions and practice test. What I found missing was the MBSA utility, which means you have to find and download it from Microsoft's website. Also they could have included other security type of utilities for help in the real world, but that can be included in any updates.<br /><br />Overall, having passed the exam in January, this book certainly does what it's designed for.	2003-05-30

When I took the 70-214 exam in January there was only one book on the market to use. I had to scour the internet for information pertaining to the exam and I was lucky enough to pass the exam.<br /><br />What is had hoped for when taking the exam was a tool to use for the final preparation of the exam objectives to be able to give myself the best chance of passing the exam on first try. This book provides such an exam tool and this is a good tool for those looking to put the finishing touches on their studies.<br /><br />The  Exam Cram series has been a source of information that that the finer points of the exam material and condenses it into a book that if used as an aide to passing can and will help those in pursuit of the certification. This book covers every objective and outlines the exam in an easy to follow manner.<br /><br />Make no mistake about this, the 70-214 exam is one of the toughest and most in depth exams I have ever taken. I found the author to have a deep and detailed knowledge of the subject matter and his style makes reading the technical material a little easier.<br /><br />You are also given a cd with the Prep Logic exam software, I found the questions to be comparable to the actual exam, but I think for the money the entire set of questions should have been included. Overall the book is a tool that will help with the exam and beyond.	2003-05-29

One side of the IT industry that is busting at the seams is security, I can not count the number of job posting for the security arena. Yet to get the entry level security jobs you have to have a way to separate the candidates and CompTIA has the exam called Security+.<br /><br />Having worked on 3 Security+ book over the past year, this exam cram book certainly has all the major points or highlights in one place. The authors, who have extensive years in the IT industry and the Security arena, have condensed the objectives and given you a tool that is meant to be used as a final stage prep tool.<br /><br />One thing about Exam Cram books is they can not replace knowledge and experience and if you are looking for the all the test answer, then this book isn't for you. However if you are looking to be able to put the finishing touches on your exam prep, than this book makes a fine addition to the QUE Security+ Training Guide.<br /><br />One thing that has always impressed me about the Exam Cram Series is the tips and hints throughout each chapter as well as the practice questions, which have excellent explanations with them. This book like other in the EC2 series includes the Prep Logic tester, and as with other books the entire set of questions should be included.<br /><br />Overall this book not only makes a fine tool for the exam but would come in handy after with the real life exam.	2003-05-29

In over 15 years of I work I am always looking for new material and books relating to the latest technology both hardware and software.<br /><br />This is the first time I have looked at the Hardware Bible and as a Computer Technical Instructor this book has already come in handy for a couple of A+ classes I am teaching.<br /><br />While the book is not written to any specific exam, I found that is would definitely help with the A+ and CST exams. The author's extensive hardware knowledge is evident throughout the book.<br /><br />One thing that impressed me throughout the book was the author not only gives detailed information about the most current technology, but also gives you a firm background on older technologies as well.<br /><br />While the book is the \\"Hardware\\" bible, there is far more than just hardware information, you'll also find TCP/IP and the internet, as well as memory management included in the overall coverage.<br /><br />I found this to be a fairly complete text to work with. You can also register online and find both the 5th and 6th editions available. About the only thing that wasn't included was a cd with hardware utilities, but looking at what you do get this is a minor drawback. Overall this book is a certainly worth the look.	2003-05-23

In the case with this book I am working with a client to teach HTML and CSS and this book fits right into the CSS part of the course.<br /><br />The use of effective CSS is and can be a vital part of web page design, which is why I was pleasantly surprised to find this book. The author breaks down the world of CSS into easy to follow and understandable guide.<br /><br />More than just how to code, this book explains what can happen with the code. The author takes you step by step and not only explains the concept but also gives you a visual tour to enhance the learning process.<br /><br />For my money this book certainly does what I need it to do.

Normally I don't review fiction books because I find that those books don't capture my attention. Stealing the Network is the exception to the rule as I found myself completely engulfed in each story.<br /><br />Nine different authors come together to show you a world you may have heard about but never thought could, would or will ever happen to you and your company - the act of being hacked and having information stolen.<br /><br />These guys hold senior IT positions with years of experience and they share what they know with you to help you better understand the mindset of the hacker.<br /><br />I found the stories enlightening as well as a little frightening, and even a little intriguing.

I have used this set of question in pursuit of my MCSA and found them to harder than the actual exam. Que has picked a winner here.<br /><br />If you are looking to pass the 70-210 exam on one book, this is not that book, but if you are looking for a book a final reference point this may be the one.	2003-05-05

Recently I passed the 70-214 exam, Security in a Windows 2000 Network Environment, I had very little resources to work with in my studies. What I could have used is this book which makes the perfect companion to Microsoft Press 70-214 Study guide.<br /><br />The text is written to a specific exam, but rather to a specific topic, security and securing your network. The book works with Windows 2000 and XP network environments and gives you extensive coverage of the security settings you may need to implement on your network.<br /><br />The authors created a 650 plus page text, which covers everything from passwords and group policies to terminal services and remote access security. I found some very and highly useful information, I really like chapter 2, Understanding Your Enemy.<br /><br />Included with the book is a cdrom with over 50 utilities you can use for finding security leaks, holes and other risks. One tool I think needs to be added is the MBSA utility and this can be added in future updates.<br /><br />Overall if you are looking to find ways to make you network more secure than this book is for you. Also whether you are new to the security arena or an old timer you can certainly learn something new.	2003-03-24

Sybex is a leader in certification technical study guides and once again they have released a first rate effort for the Security+ exam. Pastore tackles each exam objective with clear and detailed information which is right on target with the newest CompTIA release.<br /><br />Pastore has broken down the exam into 10 chapters; each chapter builds a foundation that will give a great chance of passing the exam on the first try. I like the idea of having the notes and warnings spread out throughout the book, this gives the reader some real world experience to work with.<br /><br />Chapters 5 &amp; 6, which deal with network security, are excellent guides not only for the exam but also for the real world. Pastore has done an excellent job of taking apart the exam with this book.<br /><br />Each chapter has practice questions and the cdrom included has practice test in various formats. Whether you are trying to break into the security field or have several years of working experience, this book has something for everyone.<br /><br />Overall this book would rival any others on the market today.  One thing that I think adds tremendous credibility to this book is that the technical editor is David Groth.  Together they have added another success effort to Sybex's already extensive library.	2003-03-24

Security, security, security, that's seems to be the hottest growing area of the IT industry over the last 18 months. CompTIA release of the security+ exam is the foundational standard by which companies have set a measuring stick for those looking to break into the Security field.<br /><br />In this book the authors have given you a good breakdown of the domains associated with a very tough exam. The authors seem to have covered every objective and the material is technically accurate and up to date.<br /><br />The book has over 150 practice questions included. What I found to be most helpful was the communication security as well as the infrastructure security sections. Looking at the overall content of the book you should have a good base in which to learn from.<br /><br />I was very pleased with the cdrom included, which has a practice question using the Boson Testing engine. Overall the authors have created a very good study guide and based on what I have seen from the exam, this book should help.	2003-03-24

Having recently passed the 70-214 exam, which is new from Microsoft, I had used another book for the exam study as this one arrived 2 days before my exam. With the material contained in this book had it arrived earlier I could have used it to study for the exam.<br /><br />Like most MS Press books each topic is broken down into lessons with practice labs to help you learn as you go. The cd included has a 120-day evaluation of Windows 2000 Server and the exercises coincide with the cdrom, which also has exercises on it as well.<br /><br />Looking at the questions on my exam, this book came up a little short with coverage of utils like MBSA, as I several questions on the use of MBSA and there are only a few pages and labs covering the topic.<br /><br />Although the book does a good job on other utils like QChain, HFNetChk and URLScan. As with any book there will areas with more coverage and areas with less coverage, which is why it is important to have multiple sources.<br /><br />There is a great deal of material covered in this book and it does make a nice study tool for the exam. The cd also has a practice test generator which is a nice add-on. Overall I think a few updates are needed and this book makes a great companion with other study material.	2003-03-02

Over the past 5 years usually I have already taken the certification test before reviewing the material, this way I can determine if the material would in fact help you pass the exam. For this book I decided to try it from the other way, use the book to see if I could pass the exam and this book did just that.<br /><br />Having little experience with security in a Windows 2000 network environment I used this book as the primary source of material to study for the exam. I spent 2 solid weeks reading and practicing the labs, as well as watching the DVD videos. I passed the exam first on the first try on February 28th.<br /><br />The book covers all objectives and I found the material to be right on the money with the exam questions I got. I also found that some of the material went beyond the actual exam which is certainly a bonus.<br /><br />There were exercises with utilities like MBSA, URLScan, HFNetChk and QChain, which explain how to use the utility and when to use the utility. One thing I did find is the new version of MBSA has HFNetChk built in, so you may have to be flexible with the exercises. This can be fixed in the next edition.<br /><br />Overall the material was very complete; there is also a web connection to Syngress where you can get a free web based exam. So if you are looking for a book that can help this one should work.	2003-03-02

On almost every major job search engine there are literally hundreds of opening in the security field. Security+ is the first step to obtaining one of those jobs and this book can help.<br /><br />The authors have done a decent job of covering each and every objective and domain. The book takes a more hands-on approach rather than just a manual to read and memorize. If you're like me then the more you can do the better you'll retain the information.<br /><br />One thing I like about this book is that it doesn't move from one objective to the next, what the authors do in covering the objectives but in a cohesive manner, which in some case requires the splitting of objective on several chapters. In fact there is a domain breakdown in the front of the book.<br /><br />The book has over 35 lessons and over 25 exercises, all are self paced so you learn at your speed. One thing I did notice is that you do need to understand networking and TCP/IP in order to comprehend some of the material.<br /><br />There is a cd included which has a testing tool which has about 200 questions, I am always for more, but this should provide a good foundation. There are also a few chapters of the Security Resource Kit and I really think they should have included the entire text.<br /><br />While this book does tend to lean a little to the Microsoft side of things you should be able to work with enough to have a decent shot at the exam.  You might also find it useful in the pursuit of Microsoft's 70-214 exam as well. Microsoft is also planning to add Security+ to the MCSA elective list and this is another incentive for passing the exam.<br />Finally there are an abundance of links included inthis book which allows you to further reseach the topics without hav ing to spend an enormous amount of time searching on your own. Overall fairly well done.	2003-02-24

Security+ is fast becoming a must have certification. CompTIA has released an exam that covers an enormous amount of information. You will need to find the right resources in order to have a decent shot at passing this exam on the first try.<br /><br />The TestTaker's Guide Series has proven to be an asset for me in both my personal pursuit and my professional career as an instructor. This release from author Chris Crayton brings out the major points of the exam and provides an excellent prep tool for Security+<br /><br />Crayton captures the objectives and give the finer points of information. Having work on a couple of Security+ book, I can say that Crayton has certainly done his homework here. The information is both technically accurate and up to date with IT industry.<br /><br />Every domain is covered and there are over 200 questions in the book and over 100 more on the cd. If you are looking for a comprehensive study guide this is not the book, but if you are looking for tips and a final prep tool than you have found the right manual.<br /><br />The cd tests are setup to provide a time environment. There are 4 30 questions exams, I think in the next edition the tests should be updated to reflect the actual testing environment, but this is a small drawback.<br /><br />I like Crayton's style and his ability to cover the material without droning on and on. He presents clear and concise explanations on each topic and objective. I found that question to be very similar to the actual exam and in some case harder. Overall a very good job.	2003-02-24

Having been an instrucotr for over 4 years and having taught enough computer repair classes I have found that certain books are better suited for the class than others. This is one book made for the classroom.<br />What Scott Mueller has done with his already successful book is break it down into a 12 week class. I am not sure how many hours he is spending per week. Some of the chapters are only a few pages long. But with this breakdown you can now set a learning pace based on your needs.<br />The book covers all major parts of the computer and the associated hardware. Based on the information contained within the book you could use this text to study for the A+ Exam.<br />One thing I found really usefull in pacing out the material was the student workbook included in the book as well as on the cdrom.<br />Something new added on the cd is 2 hours of video, which I found informative as well as fairly easy to watch. They cd is supposed to have 6 previous editions of the text included, however I unable to find it, either through the menu or by a manual search of the cd.<br />Overall, this is another successful venture for Scott. You might be hard pressed to find another book like it on the market today.	2003-02-11

Security+ is CompTIA's newest exam, it covers a wide variety of security concepts. Having taken the beta, help tech edit a coupe of books, I thought I had certainly seen about everything relating to the exam. The author(s) and editor(s) of this book have put together some of the best reading on the subject I have seen.<br />In just over 800 pages, the exam, which covers a vast amount of information, is taken apart and pieced together in a logical and well written format. What I found is that the book is written to the level of the intermediate skill set and this make the learning process a bit better.<br />The section on attacks, as well as the wireless section goes beyond the exam objectives; in fact the wireless section could be used for other exams such as CWNA. There is a good flow of information and it is well documented and well organized, each section building on the previous.<br />There are a few well thought out add-ons, such as the exercises, which seem to draw from real life, rather than simulation. Also the exam tips and warnings are very helpful; anyone preparing for the exam should take a close look at these.<br />At the end of each chapter you find a review test of the material, the question are well explained and I was impressed with the FAQ section in each chapter, no other book I have seen has this.<br />Finally there is a DVD with over 2 hours of instructional material. While this could be used as a stand alone tool I found it to be more helpful working with the book. Overall I think this book gives you a very good shot at passing - well done.	2003-01-20

Since beginning my quest for the MCSE or MCSA I have been searching for the self paced study guide that will make it easier for me to learn without breaking the bank. Back in April I looked at the initial release of this package, I found it to have several useful features and there were some updates needed.<br /><br />One thing need was a copy of Windows 2000 Professional and it is still not included. While the server is included the time limit of 120 days may not be enough for some and therefore this feature needs to be expanded.<br /><br />I like the updates to the 70-218 book as it has been improved over the last version, but the 70-210 book seems thin as compared to the previous release. I did use the 70-218 book in a class I taught in New Jersey and had fairly good results.<br /><br />Both the 70-215 and 216 books seem to have some updates, but for the most part they remain the same as before. Each book does map to every objective, and each book does have enough work to keep you busy so for the person trying to break into the IT industry this would be a good place to start from.<br /><br />For the more experience technician you might find some of the books lacking but there is still things you can learn from them. The cds included, now there are two, have the 120 license of 2000 Server. The other is practice exams and e-books; again I think that the practice exam should be increased.<br /><br />Overall there is still a few improvements needed, one thing the authors may want to consider is updating the books more like the Microsoft Resource kits or the Inside Out books, which a jammed packed with information that far exceed the actual exams.<br /><br />Finally, these four books do make a good training tool but you do need other resources to help you along the way. If the next release fixes and updates then the kit would become a go to reference set.	2002-12-26

One thing I found was some of the information was a little short of complete and a few typo errors in the book as well. I also found that the book states the level to be intermediate to advanced and I think it is more of the beginner to intermediate.<br /><br />I found that the book does give a good overall explanation of TCP/IP and that there were some topics like firewalls that cover only about 9 pages and I think the information could have been expanded.<br /><br />Overall the book does provide good information for the A+, Net+, CCNA and other first level exam certifications. I can also say that this book was great for a TCP/IP seminar I recently gave, but still some improvements are need to make this the go to manual.	2002-12-26

With the need for network security ever increasing daily and the need for security specialist on the rise in the industry, it is nice to see Sybex releasing an update to this manual. While I found this book to more for the foundational concepts rather than the more experienced technician, this is still a great book to work with.<br /><br />What attracted me to this book was the author Chris Brenton, of whom I read his Mastering Cisco Routers and found it an invaluable resource to my job. I also found his knowledge of this subject matter to be just as impressive, making this a first rate resource. I wished I had read this before the router book and certain concepts would have been easier to understand.<br /><br />The chapters for firewalls and particular PIX Firewalls, I thought was well documented and explained. The one thing I found most impressive by the text was the fact that the authors made or make no assumption of knowledge level, thereby ensuring the reader have an explanation that will make sense and be comprehendible at the same time.<br /><br />Another thing I found was that while this book is Network Security and does not conform to any Security Certification objectives, it would be useful for Security+ exam as well as some others. I also liked the exercises included, but I always want more, which is something to add to the next edition.<br /><br />Overall for those trying to crack the security barrier you have a great place to get started. The authors did a terrific job and Sybex has a winner in this book.	2002-12-26

I work as a technical trainer and have been doing it for over 5 years. What I have seen if a shift from the classroom to the self study due to rising costs of classes. What Cisco Press has done has taken this idea and put together the first book you need if you are new to Cisco and the certification arena.<br /><br />This self study book will get you started towards the CCNA certification as well as the CCDA certification. In fact this book should become part of the CCNA preparation library.<br /><br />Within this book you will go over the entire exam set of objectives, what you find is that the book is not as in depth as the CCNA certification guide or the Cisco Press ICND book. What you will notice is that this book does is break down the concepts in easy to follow chapters.<br /><br />For the person just getting started this is an excellent place to begin. Since this a self study book there should have been a router simulator included as well as a set of practice exams, which would make nice additions to the next edition.<br /><br />One thing I noticed is that the end of chapters has Review Exercises, which should be relabeled review questions. The answers are located in the back of the book, I also found the book to technically accurate and up to date with the latest CCNA exam.<br /><br />Finally the book is listed as a comprehensive reference for students, and I think might be a little overstated. Overall this is a very good book to have around and with a few improvements Cisco would have a winner.	2002-12-26

One thing I have learned over  the past 14 years is that when you find something that works stick with it. I have found that Todd Lammle is the go to man for Cisco. I used both his CCNA and CCDA books to pass my exams and now that I am working on CCNP and CCDP I am once again looking to him for study guides.<br /><br />Being that Cisco has retired the 640-603 exam, it was a good idea for Sybex to hold the release of this set until the 640-901 or BSCI or was ready, making the kit as up to date as possible.<br /><br />Each book does have a number of labs, in fact the BSCI book has over 55, plus there are case studies, review questions and other exercises throughout each book. Lammle certainly gives you every thing you need to work with.<br /><br />There is one thing that could be added and that is a simulator or virtual lab to work with in case you do not have access to the hardware. Although you could go to his website and pickup the Router Simulator CCNP Suite and Sybex also has their own Virtual Lab as well.<br /><br />Each book comes with a cd that has 2 full practice exams and other handy study utilities like the PDA flash cards. If there was something to increase here it would be more practice questions or a test center for all exams.<br /><br />I found that the books may have some errors but there isn't a book out there without a few grammar or spelling errors. As for technical accuracy, I compared the previous set to this set and a whole host of updates were done.<br /><br />Overall Todd Lammle has once again proven to be right in the forefront of the Cisco Certification arena and this study guide kit is a shining example of his latest work. Excellent job and well done once again.	2002-12-26

Several months back I reviewed the Windows XP Inside Out book, I was most impressed by the overall amount of information included as well as the detail and documentation of the information, Well things have gotten even better with the release of the Deluxe edition.<br /><br />With over 1400 pages and new and updated information the book that I was using to support XP clients has been replaced with this book. From the install to the configuration to customizing and faxing, you have everything here you need.<br /><br />I found additions like working with the admin account, working with older applications, using TweakUI for XP, complete updates on the multimedia and media player and communication over the internet to be very helpful in some of the everyday things I am working on right now.<br /><br />Once again I think the Windows errors section needs to be expanded and also more information on group and local policies as well. Finally you can use this book for the 70-270 exam study.<br /><br />With the book comes a cd that has 2 complete e-books and the Service pack 1 for XP and some updates to the media player. Overall this is the book I use and recommend to all my students.	2002-12-26
1293578:US	51934027	R9GEEG9JL1YQX	0735616329	306064263	Microsoft Windows Security Inside Out for Windows XP and Windows 2000 (Bpg--Inside Out)	Books	5	43	47	N	N	Microsoft Security - well done.	Microsoft has been changing OSes as often as the phone company changes area codes and with that you need to keep up on the latest developments. One of the biggest problems arising from computers today is security and this book certainly helps me to understand what it takes to lock down 2000 and XP.<br /><br /> Having worked with 2000 for over a year and XP for over 6 months, I am finding new things out everyday. I was pleasantly surprised to see that these authors have gone to great lengths to make the understanding of the security systems in 2000 and XP may not be a complex as they seem.<br /><br />The book is very well documented, in fact the entire book is in PDF format making it a portable reference. What you'll find in the 800 pages is what to do from securing the internet to restricting access to setting user rights and permissions.<br /><br />The authors have even gone as far as putting in numerous step by step exercises fro you to work with. Another thing that makes this book standout is the fact that is can be used for both the 70-214 and the Security+ exams.<br /><br />Finally the section on wireless security is one that I am re-reading, while the concepts are understandable, I have to go over the section to fully understand it. The book also has a cd included and as stated before the e-book is include as well as a number of various add-ins and utilities.<br /><br />I think the overall value comes from the fact that the book covers a wide range of security related information, 2 operating systems, and 2 versions of the XP operating system and is detailed and well documented.	2002-12-26

A jumpstart is defined as a start by use of an external source of power and that's what this book is, an external source of knowledge power. This updated book is setup for and tailored to those who are beginning the journey to the CCNA certification.<br /><br />I like the way the book is broken down in simple terms but with enough technical jargon to make the newcomers feel at ease with the subject matter. The book covers an overview of each domain and provides the reader with practice questions at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />The authors have an excellent grasp of the subject matter and attempt to give the reader just what they need to get started. The material, while not heavy into the certification, does make for easy reading and comprehension.<br /><br />The material seems to technically accurate and does in fact cover the 640-607 exam topics. I like the way the authors have put tips and notes throughout the entire book as well as definitions along the side of the pages.<br /><br />I think that the book should have included some sort of test engine, once to get the reader started thinking about  the exam, but that could be included in the next update. Overall if you are ready to take the first step to CCNA or CCDA then your jumpstart is right here.	2002-12-26

While working  on web sites or teaching web development in the classroom I have found that more and more people are looking to enhance the website without have to learn a lot of fancy programming. JavaScript and DHTML are 2 of the ways people I work with are looking for the improvements.<br /><br />This particular book, which covers over 700 pages, is the perfect addition to the web design library. According to the book the level is intermediate to advanced, but I found that the way the author presents information almost every level would find a benefit to this guide.<br /><br />With hundreds of examples to use and learn from, the book goes beyond the typical JavaScript book, giving the reader an excellent reference manual to work with. While there are no step by step instructions because the manual is written for a higher level, the novice can still work with what comes with the book.<br /><br />I found a number of ways to better the web pages I work on, also I found that working with both FrontPage and DreamWeaver this book makes coding much easier. If you looking for ways to improve what you do now this might be the best buy for the money.	2002-12-26

With the networking classes I teach I am always looking for new books and material to give to the students. I want a book that has both information  as well as lab exercises to make the learning process both enjoyable and informative. The book and lab manual combination do a decent job, but there are a few updates needed.<br /><br />The book does cover all the objectives, it has exam tips, exam questions and review questions in each chapters which make it a good book so far. I found no labs in the book, and while there is a lab manual, there should still be exercises in the book, also there were no answers to the review questions.<br /><br />The lab manual has 34 labs, while this is fair amount, more is always better. Also this manual should be combined into the big book. The cd included uses the Exam Gear testing engine, which I found to be fairly respectable.<br /><br />One pleasant surprise was the router program which you can use for the CCNA exam. The book covers both the Network+ and CSNT exams making this a useful learning tool. The book can also be used in self study or classroom modes. Make a few updates and this book is certainly well worth looking into.	2002-12-03

Over the past year I have found more and more the need to qualified security professionals. I have also found that security certifications are more in demand than ever.<br /><br />This 700 page manual is an excellent resource for the certification of CISSP. Broken down into three parts part 1 breaks down the exam objectives by covering such topics as access control, which is an excellent read.<br /><br />Also in this section you cover security management, which I found to be helpful in my job. Other topics in network fundamentals, disaster recovery and law and ethics.<br /><br />Part 2 is the final review of the entire 10 domains, which has a practice exam included. Part 3 is used for appendices and other material. There is a cd included, using the Prep Logic testing engine, and you can order more exams from the Prep Logic website.<br /><br />The book has exercises and test and review questions in each chapter. Overall the book can be used in a self study mode or better yet in the formal classroom setting.	2002-12-03

A+ is the foundation certification for all technicians and I personally think should be required for every technician. You need and want the most accurate and up to date material available and this book certainly has all that. I think the timing is a little late with all the other books already out there.<br /><br />The manual has over 1100 pages and covers each exam and all domains. The author has put the exam objective map right in the front of the book. Part 1 of the book covers the hardware and part 2 covers the operating systems.<br /><br />The chapters have a domain breakdown and review before you begin and there are hundreds of exam tips throughout the entire text. Each chapter has review questions and something I found very interesting, exam challenges throughout the chapters. The challenges are not as easy as you might think and they do provide a way to track what you are learning.<br /><br />Each chapter also include additional web resources to further the study process, another add-on to the book I found useful. Finally there is practice exams in the book for each exam.<br /><br />Included in the book is the Prep Logic testing engine and the Prep Logic website does have more exams available. While you can take this book into a self study environment, the formal classroom is where this belongs	2002-12-03

In the classroom, when I teach web design, unless the courseware comes with templates the students spend the time creating pages from scratch. While this is worthwhile for novices, there are times when you need templates for some web projects.<br /><br />In this book the authors has given you over 200 HTML templates, which are on the cd-rom, to work with. By following along with the book you'll end up creating over 50 pages. You find yourself working with frames, forms, tables, graphics and CSS.<br /><br />The book should have had the design outputs in color to allow you to be able to see what the outcome would like. I did like the 3 case studies included, which take you from a basic web page to a very advanced design layout.<br /><br />The cd-rom included trial version of Photoshop, FireWorks, Flash and HomeSite all of which have newer versions out and should be updated for the next edition. I found the JavaScript Cook to be a very handy and useful tool for creating scripts without an in depth knowledge of the coding techniques.<br /><br />The other handy utility included in the HTML/CSS Developer's resource guide, which makes the creation of CSS easier. With all the helpful tool and tricks the book is certainly a welcome addition to my HTML/Web Design library. Overall a very good value for the money.	2002-11-14

Active directory is a concept that, for me, is something of a mystery. I have been reading several books on the subject and I still have a long way to go. I found this book to be better at explaining the concepts and make the understating of the subject matter a little easier.<br /><br />It was apparent from the very beginning of the book that the author has a great deal of experience and knowledge on the subject. He uses real world experiences as well as exceptional examples of the material.<br /><br />While this book is no written o any exam structure, it can be used for Microsoft Active Directory exam and possible the Server exam as well. The first part of the book is the deployment of the Windows 2000 domains.<br /><br />Part 2 is the administration of the active directory and I found myself re-reading this section 3 times. I also found several parts of it that will help in the upcoming migration project I am involved in.<br /><br />The book gives you several tools to work with from Security to group policy to distributed services. The book is laced with tips, notes, tricks and tips making this a great addition to any administrators' library. Overall this is certainly one book that I will be able to use in the future.	2002-11-14

In becoming a CCNA and CCDA I had to study switches and switching techniques, both of which are covered very well in most study guides. What seems to be missing is coverage, extensive coverage, of switch configuration and management, that's why this book is so important.<br /><br />The authors take a specific subject, the Catalyst Switch, and break it down to the lowest level. They give extremely detailed information about the switches, from the 2950 series to the 600 series, from configuration for both layer 2 and 3, to VLANs, VTP, STP, multicasting and access control.<br /><br />Leaving virtually no stone unturned the authors have taken area of  Cisco certification and made it the focus of study. What I found most impressive was the real world examples, coupled with coding screen shots, so you can see what things look like rather than have to guess.<br /><br />Overall this book can work for the CCNA, CCDA and CCNP Switching exams. Cisco Press needs to add this to the Preparation and Certification libraries for the exams as well.	2002-11-14

I have been working on several Security certifications including CompTIA, Cisco and Microsoft, now I have found a new player in the game and finding this training guide has open a whole new world to me.<br /><br />Unaware of what TICSA certification entailed, before reading this book I went to the website and researched the subject matter as well as found exam objectives and practice exams. I then took that information and compared it to the training guide and found that the authors have taken the exam material one step beyond the exam for this book.<br /><br />I also found much of the material, whether you want the certification or not, is helpful in everyday network administration. Also the material goes a long way in other exam like Security+ and I could have certainly used this when I took that beta exam.<br /><br />There are plenty of exercises and practice questions in each chapter, tips throughout the books and warnings and field notes to help in your study. Finally there is a cd-rom with practice exam questions powered by the PrepLogic testing engine giving you a look at the exam before going live. Overall this seems to be a very useful reference manual.	2002-11-14

Find that text editors are too much coding? HomeSite, FrontPage and others just don't have the right set of application features. Want to be able to do CSS, JavaScripts, HTML, DHTML, tables, frames and forms? Can't afford the cost of formalized classroom training? You want to use DreamWeaver MX and learn how to use the application, then you have look no further.<br /><br />Having taught DreamWeaver classes over the past several months, this book is by far much better than any courseware I have used or seen. One thing I like about this is that fact that you control the pace of learning, whether you want to learn over the weekend or over the month, this book allows for complete user control.<br /><br />Fully illustrated, you start off with the basic page design and from there you will work with more advanced concepts as you progress. I really like that fact that the book is a continual process of learning and building. I also like the way the author has broken down the step by step process by adding notes in the exercises.<br /><br />One of the best features is that the pictures and diagrams are in color to allow you to see what the result will be without having to guess. Again this book exceeded any text I have used in class and has given me some new DHTML ideas for website development.<br /><br />The cd-rom included has all the files you need for each project or exercise in the book. Also included are DreamWeaver, Flash and Fireworks MX trial versions as well as a trial version of Top Style Pro.<br />I had absolutely no trouble with the exercises and found no steps missing from them. Overall if you are looking to advanced your website or are beginning to build one with DreamWeaver, stop by the bookstore and grab a copy of this manual, well worth the price.	2002-11-14

With computer and network security fast becoming the most important thing for administrators to worry about it is a good thing to have a reference manual that is both up to date for technical practices but also the manual must be more than just a study guide. This book does both and with the additions this manual makes a great go to guide for any administrator or manager.<br /><br />The authors have put together a very comprehensive text making sure that they not only cover the exam objective, they exceed them. Over 900 pages of information that works for the CISSP exam but I have found that this book can also work for the new CompTIA Security+ exam as well as Microsoft new 70-214 exam.<br /><br />At first glance you might think this book is written to the advanced level technician; however after reading through the text I found that the concepts and ideas were written for just about everyone. I was most impressed with the section on cryptography; this 175 page section is most useful for my job.<br /><br />I also found that chapter on law and ethics very interesting reading and overall the book has given several new ideas to think about in terms of what can or should be done in everyday network practices. Also the authors have included several appendices on topics outside the exam realm which make this a very compete manual.<br /><br />The book have over 700 practice exam questions so you have an excellent chance of passing the exam since the questions have explanation included. The cd-rom included uses the Boson quiz engine with hundreds of questions included. Couple this with the authors' advanced guide and you have an unbeatable combination to work with.	2002-11-14

I have taught Network+, A+, CCNA and CIW for the past four years and in each of those classes there is sections in IP addressing What I should have had was this book to teach from. The author certainly has done his homework<br /><br />The book starts with basic binary conversion which is essentials to understand when working with IP addressing. You then work with classfull addressing and fixed subnet masks. The author also explains the drawbacks to this type of addressing, which is usually skipped over in most texts.<br /><br />The discussion on VLSM is both in the positives of use as well as the negatives. Form the there the author gives and excellent breakdown of CIDR and supernetting and NAT. What I think could be added to the next edition is more practice examples. Overall this would make a nice addition to the CCNA Preparation library.	2002-11-14

In the 14 years I have been working with computers, networks and routers, etc. there is certain books that have been a constant source of information, Upgrading and Repairing PCs is one of those books.<br /><br />Scott Mueller has become a name I can trust and his latest work is certainly in keeping with the high standards he has set over the years. Expanded and updated, this 1600 page book is a fountain of information on computer parts, concepts, networking, protocols, standards, maintenance and troubleshooting.<br /><br />One thing about this book is the fact that the author has made no assumption of technical level and written the book for everyone, from beginner to administrator. Another great thing about this book is that the author not only tells you how to fix the broken part to also how to build it making this about as complete as you can get.<br /><br />One thing that this book does not do is map to any certification exams, but with the information included in the book, you might find it helpful for A+, CST, Net+ and CNCT exams. The author may want to consider tailoring the book to different exams or adding notes about which exam the section pertains to in future editions.<br /><br />The book includes a DVD with over 2 hours of video footage, while the videos are helpful in clearing up certain areas, the book should have included cd-roms for those without a DVD player. While this has no bearing on the material covered it may influence the purchase of the book.<br /><br />Overall, Scott Mueller has once again given a standout performance and released yet another technician's dream book.	2002-11-14

Now wanting to add Flash and multimedia, not mention JavaScripts I found DreamWeaver MX to be the application of choice. As such this book is one of the best in helping to fine tune the application and make web page design easier.<br /><br />There are over 100 pages to work with and whether you are an experienced DreamWeaver developer or fairly new at the game, you'll find just about every topic or question answered within the pages of this book.<br /><br />They layout of the book can either be used to run from beginning to the end or if you need help in a certain area then you can use the book for that particular topic. I also like the way this book is setup, as an instructor I have already been able to use several examples for the classroom.<br /><br />It doesn't appear that the author missed anything, as there are breakdown of buttons, shortcuts, menus, drag and drop, and preferences and properties. About the only drawback is the fact that the coded pages are not in color, so for something you may not be able to see the result before you finfish.<br /><br />The cd-rom include has trial version of the MX applications of DreamWeaver, Flash and FireWorks but more importantly over 300 extensions for you to work with, not only with this book but in actual web development. Overall Bible certainly describes this book.	2002-11-14

Russell Dean Vines and Ronald Krutz have yet another first rate manual; for the CISSP exam. The authors have gone the extra mile to produced a book that an additional studsy guide companion to their already successful CISSP Study Guide.<br /><br />This is not an addendum to the first book but rather a cut to bone manual that focuses on the exam objectives. While it may appear that the small manual is nothing more than questions and answers, after reading the text I found it provided more than just bullet points.<br /><br />There is over 200 questions with detailed explanations to work with as well as a cd-rom, using the highly successful, Boson testing engine with an additional set of practice questions. Used as a final preparation tool or as a supplement to The CISSP Prep Guide, either way  you have a great study tool.	2002-11-14

As an instructor of desktop applications such as Microsoft Office, I need to be able to answer question from students outside the realm of the classroom manual. Trying to keep up on the changes can sometime be very difficult to manage, that's why this book is so important to my everyday job.<br /><br />The book is covering Word 2002 Core &amp; expert, Excel 2002 Core &amp; expert, PowerPoint 2002, Outlook 2002 and Access 2002 core only and throughout the 900 plus pages there is more information on each topic, showing me things that I never knew or easier ways to do things I already know.<br /><br />Packed with over 350 exercises, I found out ways cut time, increase productivity and most importantly enhance both my work environment as well as the classroom. While I am not planning to take any exams in the near future, I wouldn't rule it out for next year.<br /><br />The book is laid out objective by objective based on the exam, and the authors have certainly made very effort to make the learning process easy to follow while providing good detail in the infromation presented.<br />Overall some of the more advanced user may find very little addtional information, however for those with beginner to intermendiate skills this is certinaly a very good manual to have around.	2002-10-27

I have been teaching HTML and web design classes for over 4 years and I am always looking for new ideas and techniques and this book certainly has that. There is an abundance of information contained within the 700 plus pages.<br /><br />The book has you working with HTML, CSS, Java Scripting, DHTML and XHTML. You get to try out and design frames pages, tables, forms, multimedia pages and cascading style sheets. Overall everything you need to become a very good designer is in this book including an excellent layout of the HTML 4.01 tags.<br /><br />The cd included has a number of utilities, most of which can be found just about anywhere on the web. Also included is trial version of Flash 5, DreamWeaver 4 and HomeSite 4.5 all of which have newer version out, so the next edition should have this included.<br /><br />Aside from those minor things, the files you are supposed to be able to use for some of the exercises weren't on my cd and I was unable to find them anywhere on the website so I think this needs to be fixed. Other than those fixes the book is very accurate and detailed with plenty of information for everyone	2002-10-27

Working with JavaScript is certainly becoming more and more a part of the web pages I am involved with, from wanting a clock to form validation to buttons. There is so many things and uses for JavaScript that the list seems endless.<br /><br />What I found most helpful about this book was not only was the cd filled with over 300 pre-written scripts, but that the book also has coding examples for you to follow and learn from. For me learning JavaScript is a challenge and using the examples in this book has certainly it easier to produce quality JavaScripts.<br /><br />Overall an excellent add-on the already highly successful JavaScript Bible, as you'll see when you look at the chapter headings. For example Chapter 1 in this book refers to chapter 15 in the JavaScript Bible.	2002-10-27

The author(s) have made certain they give you enough work to do with an abundance of hands-on step-by-step exercises. They have also included exam review questions and \\"Apply Your Knowledge\\" sections at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />Part I is the exam prep, which like I said covers each objective in a clear yet detail manner. I like the fact that the authors have kept the technical language to level that allows everyone to comprehend the material. Part II is the final review, which allows the reader to prepare for the actual exam.<br /><br />Included with the book is a cd with practice questions, engineered by Prep Logic. I found this software to both refreshing; in that QUE has sought to bring a new player to the certification table, and also to be very challenging. Also you can purchase more exams from the Prep Logic website which has several other MCSE exams.<br /><br />Overall the book is good, the software if excellent and I think you'll find that QUE Publishing is certainly making headway in the production of high quality certification manuals - well done.	2002-10-27

CompTIA Exam 220-221 is the A+ Core exam and having taught the certification several times I found that several book cover both exams but this is the first one I have found that tackles only the single exam and because of that you have better details for the objectives.<br /><br />Over 800 pages, which starts with a overview of the pc from the beginning, then onto motherboards, cpus, storage, scsi, memory, printers, networking and video and sound. Every exam objective has been given coverage, one thing I was impressed with is the easy to follow explanation of the Laser Printer process. The author(s) have the ability to make the complex easy, and they do it throughout the book.<br /><br />There are tips, diagrams, figures and summaries as well as review questions in each chapter, there is even a practice exam included in the book. About the only error I found in the book was on page 674 where it has you refer to Appendix C for Subnetting, there is no Appendix C in the book<br /><br />The cd included with the book uses the BeachFront Engine and has over 450 practice questions included. Overall this book is written by someone I have a great deal of respect for and the material included should give you a very good chance of passing the exam on the first try.	2002-10-27

You are looking for study material for those exams in one place and the material must have hands-on labs. Where do you go to get this, well Prentice Hall may have your answer in the book and lab manual set.<br /><br />While the book is not specifically written for any either the 70-210 or 70-215 exams, it does give you information and material on both. It also has material for the 70-26 and 70-215 exams as well.<br /><br />The book starts off with the overview of Windows, from 3.X to 2000 Advanced Server. From there you are installing, customizing, managing and administrating both the Professional and server. File Sharing, Group policy, data storage, disaster recovery, troubleshooting and security round out the text.<br /><br />Written with great detail, I found the manual to be easy to follow and understand. I also found the step by step exercises in the book to be very helpful as well. One thing I really liked was that both review and test questions are included in each chapter.<br /><br />The lab manual has over 35 labs, as with other books in this series, I again think this should be incorporated into the manual. The labs are both excellent tools for learning as well as helpful for every day network involvement. There is also a cd included with practice questions for both the 210 and 215 exams and overall this is a good study tool in the self study arena or in the classroom environment.	2002-10-27

So if you thinking of working with network security or are currently employed in a position like that, you would be making a great choice with this book.<br /><br />Priced to fit any budget, this book is a great reference manual to have around.

Aside from being a Technical Instructor and freelance reviewer, I am also a Network Manager. I am currently involved in a migration from NT Server to 2000 Server with active directory. I found things in the book and lab manual set that are right on target with this project and at the same time I can use the experience to help study for the exam.<br /><br />I found that the troubleshooting techniques and tips to most useful. Several people I know who are already Server Certified also found things in the book that provided them new ideas. As with other books in this series the exam challenges and review questions, as well as the material covered were right on with the exam objectives.<br /><br />The book is setup not to teach you how to take the exam but rather to enhance you ability to work with Windows 2000 server, the exam certification is a plus that you can attain by working with the material and practicing.<br /><br />Include with this book is a lab manual and cd, the lab manual has over 35 labs, again the lab manual is fine, but I would prefer it be incorporated with the book for a more fluid learning process.

One thing I find to be very helpful when either teaching a class, study for an exam or trying to enhance my skill set is to be able to perform the tasks as I learn, that's why this book and lab manual were a perfect fit to a class I recently taught.<br /><br />The book goes in the install to the configuration and monitoring to administration and security and every exam objective in between, and the book has an abundance of notes, tips and tricks throughout it. There are even step by step exercises in the book.<br /><br />The author(s) put together a book that is both technical and detailed, while being easy to read and follow along. I think the test review questions and exam challenges throughout each chapter were especially helpful to myself and the students.<br /><br />The manual has over 30 labs included and I think that this should be combined with the book rather than a separate item, but the next revision can address this, but it doesn't detract from the text in any way.<br /><br />The cd included is the same as the one with the Exam Preparation book, which would make a handy companion to this manual. Again I think that if the cd has over 500 questions they should be included and again this can be addressed in the next edition.<br />Overall I found to be helpful in both the classroom and my everyday job.	2002-10-27

It is imperative that you know the right way, the best way and if your equipment is Cisco, the Cisco way. This book may very well the bible for Cisco Security policy.<br /><br />The authors have put together some of the best work on ACL and firewall using PIX. The detail is nothing short of amazing and their ability to make the subject matter is also a plus for this book.<br /><br />One area that I am not all that familiar with is the CISCO AAA, but after reading the 70 pages, I was amazed at amount of information included and also how important AAA is to creating a high secure network.<br /><br />There also detailed coverage of VPN technologies, the only thing I found strange was that networking basics is at the end of book rather than the beginning. There are review questions at the end of each chapter and about a half dozen labs to work with.<br /><br />Not written o any specific exam, this book can and should help with all Cisco security exams as well as several industry exam like Security+.

Teaching HTML for the past 5 years I have certainly found that there very few really in depth reference manuals, this book does have some really nice features, however at the same time there things that confused me about the book.<br /><br />One thing I found odd was the 4 pages covering XML/XSL, after reading this I think the author could have left this out of the book and expanded and very good section on severs and server options.<br /><br />Part III, development of pages with HTML is very good with fairly good coverage of each section. In the next edition they should bring some of the web editors more up to date. One section I found to very well written is Part IV or CSS, the authors seem to have everything covered here.<br /><br />Part VII - cross browsers, deal with DHTML and JavaScript, I found this section to be okay but certainly more, much more information should have been included. One of the most impressive sections of the book is Appendices A through G, which is by far the best breakdown of attributes, CSS syntax, color  and hex conversion I have ever seen.<br /><br />The cd included is mostly made up of trial version of software and most of the software has newer version available, so this will also need fixing for the next release. Overall, since I don't need the eval software, I found that the book certainly serves a purpose and for those new to the HTML arena this book should be helpful.	2002-10-27

When I first started reading this book I thought I was only concerned with how e-business runs, but after delving further into the book and looking at the examples and diagrams I found out that this book is more than just how  e-commerce works it also what makes e-commerce work.<br /><br />While only about 225 pages in length, don't be fooled by that, this book packs a great deal of information within its pages. From the design and what hardware to choose to making sure you have no downtime to consideration outside the network world, this book seems to cover every angle and approach.<br /><br />The authors make sure you understand the need for security, how QoS affects the website and  why network management is so very important. Put it all together and you have the foundation you need to not only run an e-business but manage it as well.<br /><br />Overall, I am not sure if this book was written for any one exam certification but it should help with several. Also there is several review questions at the end of each chapter.<br />This is certianly an ivestment well worth the price.	2002-10-27

The author has left no stone unturned, every design question I thought of  I was able to find either the answer or an example to work with.<br /><br />The cd include with the book makes a fine addition with over 300 scripts include, plus additional shareware applications.

What separates good study material from not so good material? One thing is for sure the author must have a detailed understanding as well as the ability to convey a concept in the subject they are writing about. What we have here is a good example of how this works.<br /><br />Having read other books by this author I am pleased to find that his tradition of excellence is still going strong. This book is a scaled down InsideScoop going right to the heart of the matter and giving you the meat of the explanation without any fluff.<br /><br />There are review questions, diagrams, figures and tips and tricks all through the book. The author has made sure each and every exam objective is covered. I found very few technical errors, and overall this book coupled with the InsideScoop and ExamWise books should have you certified first time around.	2002-10-27

Windows 2000 Professional is fast becoming the OS of choice and with that Microsoft exam 70-210 seems to be the exam you'll need to master. I have found that books that only deal in the exam objective are helpful but you'll need other material to help fill in the gaps, this book is certainly a help but not as a stand alone choice.<br /><br />While the author has made sure every exam objective is covered, and filled the book with tips and tricks you still need to have some hands-on labs to aide in the learning process. Each chapter has review question at the end and scattered throughout the chapter is Exam Challenges, which I found to be helpful but again you need some equipment to try them out.<br /><br />Overall I found the book to be useful; also there is a cd with 2 exams of 75 questions each, 1 for the 70-210 and 1 for the 70-215 exams. I think that since this is a 70-210 book both exams should be for that and I am sure in the next update this can be fixed.<br /><br />The cd also contain over 500 other questions that can be unlocked for and additional $50.00, again I think this should be included with the book, however this is a minor fix. The unlock code can be purchased online and overall the book does its job.	2002-10-27

Every time the name Cisco comes up in technical certification talk most people automatically think routers and switches but the company has a whole lot more including telecommunications.<br /><br />In this book you'll find the most detailed explanation of the telecommunications I have seen thus far. The authors are extremely knowledgeable in this subject matter and the end result is this 600 plus page reference manual, that would be a must have for anyone who is working with data communication or high end networks.<br /><br />Their breakdown of analog to digital conversion is well organized and technically accurate. I also was impressed by the amount of information included on the T, E and R carriers. Also included is discussion about ISDN, both BRI and PRI, frame relay, ATM, DSL, CABLE, SONET and for the first time I have ever seen SMDS.<br /><br />Throughout the entire text you'll find helpful hints and tips, screen shots of actual routers or other equipment as well as a number of diagrams and figures, which give a visual aide to learning. The material is written to a higher level of understanding and you need to understand certain concepts before proceeding, but overall just about anyone in the industry will be able to benefit from this book.<br /><br />Finally I found this book to be a useful add-on to study for several exams, some outside of the Cisco arena, including Network+, CCNA, CCDA, Server+ and Security+. Cisco Press is a proven leader in the high end networking.	2002-10-27

You have to take the 640-607 exam and you need the right study materials. Where are you going to find a training center? Where are you going to find a way to access router and switches? Most importantly where are you going to find a way to practice the exam before going live? Where can do all this and not go broke at the same time - well Sybex has put together my choice with this training kit.<br /><br />This is by far the most complete software certification training kit on the market today bar none. With a virtual trainer that has you take a pre-assessment test to find out what you need to study. The Virtual trainer comes with over 900 questions and this trainer will adapt to your needs rather than just a run by the objective trainer.<br /><br />From there you will work with the one of best Virtual labs, with over 20 labs and you can create your own if you want more. You practice with 3 routers 1 switch and 1 host; although I think more equipment could be added. I found that by having to configure 3 routers you practice the commands and configurations, and you can do the labs over and over again until you feel comfortable.<br /><br />Finally there is a Virtual Test center with another 400 plus questions. The best thing about this was the different type of testing setups you have, from the fixed to random testing. When you complete the report gives you an analysis of your score to help you better gauge what to study. With all 3 applications you cover each and every objective, couple with Sybex CCNA Study Guide and this is the unbeatable package.<br /><br />Overall you would be hard pressed to find anything close to this on the market. Sybex should package this with the CCNA study guide and maybe in future releases we will see this. As for the installation of the software, I was able to run on Windows 98, ME, 2000 and XP professional. Well Done to Sybex for the complete and total package.	2002-10-19

While the 70-218 exam seems to cover a great deal of material it's good to know that there is manuals out there that can help you study.<br /><br />With over 95 exercises, over 15 labs and over 500 practice questions and half of the book dealing with troubleshooting, this is an excellent good user guide for both self study and in the classroom. What the authors have done is completely covered each objective and the overall result is one of the best guides on the market today.<br /><br />From installing DNS to configuration of DHCP to working with group policies and server administration there is more than enough information and exercises to keep you very busy. I like the fact that this book is setup in a manner that allows you to work at your pace and also repeat lessons as you need to.<br /><br />The cdrom included is also an added bonus; unlike most cds I have seen this one include videos so you can learn by watching. You also have the ability to take several practice exams before going live and they include and e-book; which has an added chapter for hotfixes and services packs.<br /><br />Something new added to the Cd is the Master Exam, like no other software I have seen before. This software has very detailed explanations and they stay away from the Microsoft \\"most correct\\" answer type questions.<br /><br />With the Master exam you can also download a 70-218 a simulation from LearnKey, again adding greater value to the overall package. With everything included you have the total package, about the only it doesn't do is take the exam for you.	2002-10-16

Over the past 25 years I have seen Chicago in Concert over 50 times. I simply love their music and I am truly amazed at the fact that they have been around for over 35 years.<br />I bought this book because I thought it was going to be a history lesson on the band and it is but it is also so much more.<br />Covering the band from the beginning with members Terry Kath and Robert Lamm to the days of Peter Cetera to the lastet members Tris Imboden adn Keith Howland.<br />The book covers every album including Chicago 26 &quot;live in Concert&quot;. I am most impressed and hope as the band continues another edition will come out.<br />If you love Chicago Like I do, then you have to get this book it is as sweet as the music of the band.	2002-09-27

I have been working with Exchange Servers for about 2 years, and now I in the process of going to Exchange 2000. I thought this would be a fairly transparent transition. After reading through this book I was amazed at how much work goes into the migration and upgrade.<br /><br />From the planning of Exchange 2000 in an NT environment, to deploying and using Active directory services to over a 100 pages for upgrading and testing, which I found to most important reading.<br /><br />Also there is discussion of the clients, working with applications that integrate with Outlook and exchange as well as Terminal Server and Outlook Web Access. I have already used or will be using several ideas that I learned from this book.<br /><br />Finally there is a cd with tools and utilities included that help diagram the topology and another for modifying the Global Address list. Working with a couple of other people and using this book, the transition should be less complicated that I first thought	2002-09-25

Having taken the CIW Foundations exam 2 years ago I was stunned by the lack of study material out there at the time, I certainly wished I had this around to use before taking the exam.<br /><br />This book is not flooded with material, rather is written in question format, and there are over 400 questions to work with covering every exam objective. In fact the objective covered is listed with the questions. Based on the questions in the book they seem very complimentary to the actual exam itself.<br /><br />A great final review tool coupled with the offer to get free online quizzes from Beach Front make this a study tool that works for those in the self study mode. There are some update need, for example question 91 in the internet fundamentals section is listed twice, but this certainly does not take a way from the usefulness the material presented.	2002-09-25

With the MCSE and MCSA Certification out there, there is an abundance of books to cover the exams. What helps make the decision to use certain book must be the material contained in the book as well as the information being accurate and up to date.<br /><br />For the most part this book does a good job tackling the objectives of the Windows 2000 Professional exam by covering topics like installation, configuration, Hardware, protocols, security, administration and troubleshooting.<br /><br />Like most books out there keeping with small changes in the exam is difficult and these updates can surely be fixed in the next edition. The book gives you over 30 labs to work with, if you are self studying you'll need to find equipment and software to use.<br /><br />There is also a pre-test questions, pop quizzes through out the book, notes, tips, review questions and exercises with each chapter and a 129 question practice exam in the book. Included with the book is a cd with over 300 more questions. Overall a very good study tool to use.	2002-09-25

The newest version of the Network+ exam from CompTIA has been updated to more current technology, Microsoft Press has put together one of the better books on the subject and it can works as self study or in a formalized classroom environment.<br /><br />The book does cover every exam objective in order, and although is does give a \\"Microsoft\\" slant to the picture, this book still works well. There are 50 lessons with over 40 exercises, and in the next edition there could be more added.<br /><br />There was also an lab manual included with 19 more labs consisting of over 55 exercises, most of which seemed right on the objective target. I also like the cd included with 120 day evaluation of Windows 2000 Server.<br /><br />The other cd has the e-book, several flash demos about the only thing missing is some sort of practice exams software, which can also be added to the next edition. Overall this book makes working towards the MCSA quite a bit easier.	2002-09-25

Sometime when I pick a book to review I have no idea what information is contained within the pages. So much to my surprise I was extremely pleased to find this 240 page book so chock full of useful information.<br /><br />What I found after reading this book is that the author must be very experienced in the High Availability networking and the information was detailed, but also written at the level for the beginner or intermediate technician.<br /><br />Taking the reader from the topologies and hardware, to environment and design, the author gives you 10 scenarios from real world situations. Finally there was a cd included with a System High Availability Calculator (SHARC) to calculate reliability and availability.<br /><br />Overall I have most certainly learned something new from a well organized and well documented book - great job!	2002-09-25

Working on the transition to Exchange 2000 is a project that I am involved with. I am using the Resource Kit for a lot of planning and deployment ideas. I think that with book as a compliment to this book I will be able to pass the exam.<br /><br />I found that there are over 80 labs in the book and coupled with the 120 day evaluation of the software this make it easier to process the concepts. What I found was that unlike some of the other Microsoft Press books, this one does not seems to flow as well from topic to topic.<br /><br />Also being new to the Exchange 2000 Arena, I also thought this book may have been written to those with a little more experience. Although I did like the deployment, public folders and especially the Outlook Web Access section, since they apply more to what I am working on.<br /><br />Overall I think this book can be a handy and useful tool if it was scaled down to every technical level.	2002-09-25

While working with several clients who have technicians needing to pass the CCNA exam I discovered a book that will certainly enhance the learning process. This book does need some updating to fix some grammar errors, but for the most part it makes affine study tool.<br /><br />The 680 page book comes with 12 labs  and 2 remote labs, to be a more effective tool there should be more labs as well as some sort of simulator for those without access to equipment. Also the there needs to be more labs working with switching equipment as well.<br /><br />What I found most useful was the pre test questions, pop quizzes galore and post assessment test questions in each chapter. Also once the reader is ready there is a 120 question practice exam. Unfortunately the practice exam is not interactive so you do not get the full exam effect.<br /><br />There is also a cdrom with over 550 questions and they do emulate the actual exam so this does give you a look at the test before going live. There were no install problems encountered and you can get an updated test engine from Beach Front.<br /><br />Overall a few fixes here and there,  which should make the next edition even better and this book earns the top rating.	2002-09-25

You then move to LANs and WANs with coverage of ATM, Frame Relay and SONET.<br /><br />The hardware section covers protocols for both LAN and WAN, NOSes as well as Desktop operating systems. Finally you finish up with the security section, covering VPN, thin clients, NAT and troubleshooting.<br /><br />There are also review questions at the end of each chapter to review what you have learned. The book was well organized, well documented and very well edited as I found only a few minor grammar errors.  Excellent job!	2002-09-25

Having reviewed over 800 technical books over the past 5 years, and having with in the computer industry for over 14 years with 8 of those years dealing with networking, I thought I had a very good understanding of networking and networking concepts, After reading this book and taking the test in the back I found there is always something new to learn.<br /><br />This book is not for one specific exam but rather it can be used for the A+, Network+, Server+ and several ETA exams. The author has made certain that the information is not only accurate but up to date with the current technology.<br /><br />Covering topics like topologies, protocols, NOSes, wireless WANs, RAID, SCSI, Hardware, backups, virus management, upgrading and most importantly troubleshooting, this book is a must have for every network technician of all skill levels.<br /><br />The book has over 250 troubleshooting symptoms and the resolutions, and the book has cross references and well as web resources to use for further research. In the back of the book is a DLS Network Technician Certificate Exam, this is well worth taking and paying the fee.<br /><br />I found the exam challenging and there was only one tiny error on question 71, which should read Table 9-2 instead of 9-5. Overall this is one great reference book to have around.	2002-09-13

The newest technology for networking is wireless and the protocol that covers this is 802.11. In just over 280 pages I found a wealth of information that not only simplifies the concepts but also helped me understand how this new technology will enhance networking as we know it.<br /><br />What the authors do in this book, which I haven't seen in any others is breakdown the protocol first, explaining how the different levels of 802.11, BlueTooth and 3G work. This includes 802.11, 11A, 11B and 11G, each having a specific purpose and function.<br /><br />I found that not only is there different types of protocols but also hardware and carriers for wireless LANs as well, the book does a good job of distinguishing each from the other. The authors also cover the process of implementation and planning which makes this a fairly well rounded manual.<br /><br />One thing I like most about the book was the coverage of the applications you can use and what groups are already using the technology. While this book isn't written to any certification per say, this book will be a handy reference for the CWNA exam and beyond	2002-09-13

Having dealt with Microsoft over the past 14 years and taken some of their exams, I have found that nothing beats study material that not only covers the objectives but also gives you the ability to learn at your pace and has good hands-on exercises. That is what I found here in this book.<br /><br />This self paced, 1100 page book has been updated since its initial release so there is improvements within the text itself.  In part 1 you have over 60 lessons to work at your pace, work them over and over till you understand the material and then move on.<br /><br />Part 2, which was my favorite part the book, is the test prep section. This is broken down objective by objective with review questions included. The cd included now has practice exams and a 120-day evaluation copy of Windows 2000 Server.<br /><br />Overall new updates, better lesson breakdown and an very good exam review section make this a very useful tool to work with.	2002-09-13

CompTia's A+ exam is the stepping stone to a big future in computers, networking and administration. What you need to pass the exam is a experience and good study materials. This et of books is good but there are a few problems with the materials you get.<br /><br />The big book has over 50 exercises, which could be increased, given the depth of material you need to cover and learn. Also there are only 14 labs, here again you should have a lab manual included. The book does however cover each objective fairly well, although there needs more coverage of networking.<br /><br />Finally the big book has over 300 review questions, the cd included has an additional 20 labs, over 15 videos and 2 complete exams and the publishers have gone with a new software vendor which is a nice addition.<br /><br />The other book included is the Test Yourself, which has over 200 more questions, and again there should be more. What was to be included was a free ExamSim download, which was not in either book and I was unable to locate it on the website.<br /><br />Overall the big book buy itself is a good tool, this package needs updating in order to become a tool that can be used for self study or in a classroom.	2002-09-13

Overall the author has given you a handy reference manual. Keep in mind that this book is a supplement to studying and you will need other books.<br /><br />The book is setup in a manner that covers each objective from beginning to end. Each chapter has a study time frame to set a guide for you, although you can take as much time as need in the areas you are having trouble with.<br /><br />Throughout the book there is exam tips and notes as well as review questions at the end of each chapter, which should give you a good handle on the exam. Also included is a cdrom with more question to practice with. What the author has done is taken the reader straight to the exam point, without sacrificing content.	2002-09-13

In the process of reviewing books one thing I have found is that when you try to combine several exams in one book you usually have problems trying to cover all the exams. For the most part this book does not come under that rule, however the book could be updated with more information for each exam.<br /><br />In over 950 pages the 70-210, 70-215 and 70-218 exams are broken down with over 175 exercises. This book is a great self study tool but I found it to be a little difficult to adapt to a classroom environment with some of the exercises.<br /><br />From installation to upgrading, configurations of both hardware and software, through management of the network and servers and great coverage of TCP/IP, these are but a few of the topics discussed in the pages.<br /><br />The review questions are right in line with the exams and the book is not broken down by exam but rather it incorporates the exams together making a much better flow of material. The cdrom has the entire e-book, as well as lab simulations and 300 plus practice questions.	2002-09-13

CompTia's newest edition of the Network+ exam is out and also I had to teach a class on Networking.

Part 1 of the book is the exam preparation covering hardware, the OSI model, protocols, 80 pages on TCP/IP, wan technologies and 120 pages for troubleshooting.<br /><br />Part 2 is the final review section with and good overview of the major points and also tips and notes. The cd included has the e-book as well as over 150 question in various testing formats. Overall the book needs more practice questions and a simulation tool for those not able to access the equipment every day.<br /><br />The book does work well in a classroom and also makes a very nice study tool. Fix a few things and add in more coverage of wireless and security and this book earns the 5 star rating.	2002-09-13

Over the past 14 years there are several people who I have come to trust to produce exam material that will more than cover the exam. Mike Meyers is the premier name in the A+ certification arena and this book has new updates and coverage of both A+ exams and more.<br /><br />Nothing short of amazing is the amount of detailed and technically accurate information presented in this book in the over 1100 pages. One thing I was impressed with was the Pre-Test that starts this book, this gives the candidate a more accurate account of the skill set required to pass the exam.<br /><br />Breaking down the book is the first 8 chapters covering hardware, while chapters 9 through 12 deals with DOS, Windows 9.X and 2000, I think NT workstation should be included, but this does not detract from the book whatsoever. Chapters 13 through 19 are more hardware and finally chapter 20 for networking.<br /><br />As I have come to expect there are review questions with each chapter, which far and away tougher than the actual exam. The book is well organized and documented making this the perfect study tool for both self study and classroom teaching.<br /><br />The cd included has a number of tools and utilities, plus over 1 hour of training videos, 500+ questions in adaptive format to work with as well as 6 full practice exams. With everything include about the only thing it doesn't do is take the exam for you.	2002-09-13

Microsoft's MCSA certification is fastly becoming the certification to obtain for those in the Network Administration positions. While the 70-218 exam seems to cover a great deal of material it's good to know that there is manuals out there that can help you study.<br /> <br />The books has over 95 exercises, over 15 labs and over 500 practice questions and over half of the book deals with troubleshooting, which makes this a very good user guide for both self study and in the classroom. What the authors do is make sure each objective is covered completely and the overall result is a fairly good guide.<br /> <br />There is also a cdrom included with the complete e-book version, 2 complete practice exams and over 30 additional labs. The cd has an additional chapter included to deal; with hotfixes, upgrade and service pack installation. <br /> <br />What is missing is some sort of simulation program for those without access to equipment on a regular basis. Overall with this update and a few more labs this book would make one great manual.	2002-09-13

Working with Cisco Routers is part of what I do everyday and there are time when I need an information about the router or a configuration entry, or I might want to change certain parameters to enhance the performance of the network. Using this book I can have a great manual to go to for almost every purpose.<br /><br />Broken down into 4 parts, with Part 1 covering Networking basics, such as an excellent explanation of the OSI model from top to bottom. Also 90 pages of TCP/IP breakdown as well as IPX/SPX and WAN technologies finish out this section.<br /><br />Part 2 is the CISCO technology overview, from the router layout, which included several models, to the switch layout for both LAN and WAN switches and what I found to be most helpful was the 125 pages covering the IOS and commands.<br /><br />Part 3 is the LAN switching and configuration section, covering Layer 1, 2, 3 and 4 switching. This is followed by Part 4 or the Routing section, and here you have coverage of all the protocols from RIP I and II, IGRP, EIRGP, OSPF in single and multiple environments and Access lists. What is missing is coverage of BGP, which could be included in the next edition.<br /><br />Overall this book is very complete and while no specific exam is covered this book can and should help with all Cisco Exams.	2002-09-13

Todd Lammle has made a reputation for delivering CCNA Study Guide that will help you pass the exam the first time around, this book is certainly no exception. Cisco changed the exam from 640-507 to 640-607 and Lammle has kept pace with those changes in this must have reference manual.<br /><br />Placing the exam objectives right in the front of the book, you then move to a assessment test that is both challenging and as a true measurement of the new exam as I have seen so far. Updated to the new exam this 825 page book should be the first place you go to study for the exam.<br /><br />Layout of study guide is extremely important to the flow of material and that's why this book is so very good. Lammle starts off with internetworking overview and then to Layer 2 switching, from there you move to the IOS, routing, RIP, IGRP, VLANs, access lists, IPX, and WAN technologies, making this a very well rounded manual.<br /><br />With 36 written and hands-on labs plus and added 7 labs in Appendix B for switching, coupled with over 200 review questions and tips and tricks, Lammle has once again given the reader everything and more they need to have an excellent shot at the exam.<br /><br />Most books stop there but Lammle once again exceeds everyone by giving you 2 cdroms, the first is study tools like 200 practice questions, which include simulation type questions. 400 flash cards and 10 bonus exams along with the entire book in PDF format.<br /><br />The second cd has a virtual lab to work with, including instructions for setup and use. While this book may cost a little more than others, the value and information clearly outweigh the cost difference as you have the number 1 book on the market.	2002-08-13

This software is a good study tool for the CCNP exams. While the software covers the 640-5X series and should be updated to the 600 series I think you still have a excellent tool to work with.<br /><br />There is over 1600 questions covering the four exams and judging from the content of the material you have questions that go beyond the exam objectives.

Recently I was assigned to head a project to re-design the voice and data infrastructure of our office, with book and several hours of reading I now know how work goes into project planning and management.<br /><br />While this book is use for PMP exam, it would server very nicely for the IT Project+ exam from CompTia as well. In this 500 plus page book you have an assessment test right off the bat, after taking this test I found that there were several areas in which I was unfamiliar with.<br /><br />From the beginning with  initiating a project by setting goals and requirements to setting up the project, creating a scope, planning and control over the project all the way to building the team and working through changes in the project, the book is more than a study guide, it is a Project managers reference manual.<br /><br />About the only flaw in the book were the review questions for chapters 1 and 2. While the question are numbered correctly from 1 to 20 the answers start at 80 and go to 100 and this may cause confusion on the readers part.<br /><br />Included in the book is a cdrom with 200 practice questions, flash cards and 2 exams plus the e-book version the study guide.

CompTia release of the new Network+ exam with all new updates has spawned an abundance of books, tests, study guides and training material. What separates the good from the bad is the way the material is presented, the detail and the technical accuracy of the material. This book ranks as one of the best I have seen.<br /><br />I read the book from cover to cover twice; I was highly impressed by the authors' attention to detail and the amount of information contained within the 750 pages. I found the book to be well edited and found very few technical or grammar errors. The information does indeed exceed the exam objectives making this a very useful tool.<br /><br />The book has one of the best breakdowns for the OSI model and TCP/IP I have come across. The book has test questions, tips, tricks, diagrams and figures in each chapter. One of things I was most impressed with was the way the information is laid out in a language that just about everyone can understand and comprehend.<br /><br />Also include in the package I got was subliminal audio cd, this cd I played while working and sleeping and found I was able to retain more information. It may not be for everyone but it does provide another source of study material. Keep in mind it will not replace the book you still need  to study and practice.<br /><br />Finally there is a cd included in the book with the BeachFront Quizzer program and a set of over 200 questions to practice from. About the only 2 drawbacks is that I could find is there should be more questions on the practice cd and the price is a little steep. Aside from that you have an excellent package to work and learn from.<br /><br />While the book may be a little on the pricey side this should not deter anyone seeking the certification from buying it, I believe the investment is worth it. Overall this is book rivals any other out there today.	2002-07-09

The subnetting questions are difficult but if you use the manual to learn the techniques you should have no problem.<br /><br />This book is natural progression for the classroom instruction but can be used in a self study mode as well. The cd-rom included has over 300 questions in the new exam format so you have a chance to see the exam before going live. The cd I tested is an updated to the original that comes with the book. The questions seemed to be better tested and the results should be more accurate.<br /><br />Installing the cd, I found that I needed to disable the virus program. Other than that it worked with Windows 98, NT Workstation, 2000 Professional and XP Professional. I found the questions to be tougher than the actual exam, coupled with the book you should a very good chance the first time around.	2002-06-19

Things like A+ certification to DMZ to IEEE to MDAC to RPC and ZAK.<br /><br />The book has an abundance of pictures, diagrams, tables, figures, screen shots and code included with overviews of each word and cross referenced was well.

As an instructor this is an essentials topic for networking and this book is a handy reference manual to have around.<br />Covering over 500 pages, you'll start off with the origins of the TCP/IP suite and work with the TCP/IP model which has an excellent breakdown of the layers. Also the section covers the protocols like ICMP, TCP, UDP, POP, IMAP, HTTP, SNMP and DHCP.<br />Another area that I found very useful is the section devoted to discussing classless and classfull routing. There are more section like IP Routing, multicasting, IPSec, IP Over ATM, which is new to me and I fond this very informative as well as interesting.<br />Other topics also included are VoIP, and a 10 page overview of IPv6.

Cisco recently dropped the 640-507 exam and released the 640-607 CCNA exam, so what has changed? With the content basically staying the same as it true with the objectives, then this set of books is mostly updates for the new exam.<br /><br />Book 1, The Internetworking Technologies Handbook, is still an excellent source of information and I didn't see any changes at all. The book is a good reference however I think it should be dropped from this library and replaced with other Cisco Press books such as CCNA Practical Studies, CCNA Flash Card Practice Kit as well as CCNA Router and switch e-Sim.<br /><br />Book 2, ICND course book by Steve McQuerry, which has been updated is an excellent resource for the exam as well as teaching for the classroom environment. About the only missing from the book is a cd with practice questions and a simulator to coincide with the book.<br /><br />Book 3, CCNA Examination Guide by Wendell Odom, is by far one of the most detailed and documented books covering the new exam, and it I was impressed with the cd included and found the exam questions to be far tougher than the actual exam. Overall still a very good value.	2002-05-28

Having been involved in web design and teaching the web fundamentals I was certainly surprised to see Cisco Press release a  book dealing with web design. I was not surprise by how well detailed the book is since I have come to expect excellence from Cisco Press.<br /><br />The authors put together a 660 page guide to help out even the most advanced web professional. From the start with the creation of the website using different protocols, connection types, browsers and services to web page elements and the decision of what goes into the web page itself this book seems fairly complete.<br /><br />The authors also include other web design techniques using XHTML and CSS as well as setting up links, navigation, interactive pages, web hosting and marketing. After reading this book I found to very helpful in projects I am currently working on.<br /><br />On the flip side the book does need more step by step instructions an how to perform some of the more key concepts and more hands on exercises. Also a cd should be included with practice files and exercises, however it does have several useful web tools and plenty of reference material	2002-04-24

While there is only 30 pages given to TCP/IP, which will certainly be enough o pass the exam, I think this section needs to be expanded.<br /><br />I was very happy to see the security section updated with the latest information  as this section was well documented. Each chapter has review questions as well as a full practice exam in the book. One other section to expand should be the HTML coding and possibly the JavaScript section.<br /><br />Finally the cd has practice exams in a customizable format and well as flash cards for the pc and palm and finally an e-book.

Prosoft CIW Foundation exam 1D0-410 is the foundation on which all other exams are built, you must pass this exam in order to take any others. Finally there is a book that covers all the objectives in an understandable and logical manner.<br /><br />As you open the 700 page book you have an objective map right in front of you and this book will also help in the study for the INET+ exam. There are three parts to this book Internet Business, HTML and Networking fundamentals, each section makes sure the objective are taken care of.<br /><br />There is very good coverage of TCP/IP and the OSI model as well as security and the e-commerce section is good  but I think more information should have been included. I was impressed with the 128 pages of HTML, providing excellent examples and outstanding exercises.<br /><br />Overall there are over 50 exercises and several real world scenarios and the review questions at the end of each chapter give a  real challenge. As with most other Sybex books the cd has practice exams which can be taken by chapter or a full exam, also there is flash cards for the pc and palm and an e-book.<br /><br />Overall a very likely candidate for use with the CIW Foundations exam - well done.	2002-04-24

Server+ hasn't been around that long but already the exam is being updated, Sybex has made a reputation on releasing reference manuals with the most accurate information possible. This book is no exception, they change authors, updated the material and you have been given a first class study guide.<br /><br />Right as you open the book you are given an objective map to follow. The book is broken down in the 5 parts, install which include planning to installing and administration. Hardware from storage to networking to RIAD, which by the way is one of the best breakdowns I have seen so far.<br /><br />The NOSes with TCP/IP, which should have a little more information, although it does a fairly good job of covering. Upgrading, maintenance, backups and disaster recovery are next followed by 70+ pages of troubleshooting.<br /><br />The authors are well organized and the book can be studied from any point in the book. There are more than enough practice questions in the book and the cd has Edge Test practice exams as well as palm flash cards and an e-book. Overall the changes are needed and the book will certainly help.	2002-04-24

Having taught the CCNA course with Cisco Press providing the books I found that the Wendell Odom certainly goes far beyond the exam. With the new 640-607 exam out it is important to make sure that the material you study from is up to date and this book takes care of that.<br /> <br />What you have is over 1,000 pages that cover the exam objectives and then some. Odom has taken a great deal of time to ensure that the material does exceed the exam. This book is more than a study guide it is  a great reference manual to have.<br /> <br />The  book includes over 25 scenarios, 35 tasks, 8 labs and an appendix with 25 subnetting questions. The subnetting questions are difficult but if you use the manual to learn the techniques you should have no problem. Also each chapter has review questions and answers included.<br /> <br />This book is natural progression for the classroom instruction but can be used in a self study mode as well. The cd-rom included has over 300 questions in the new exam format so you have a chance to see the exam before going live. Overall Odom has once again proven that he knows what you need to pass.	2002-04-24

Network+ has a new exam and as such new material needs to be studied in order to pass the objectives and the exam. This 2 set reference manuals could be a great tool for that purpose.<br /><br />Book 1 is a Test Yourself book with 250 plus questions going objective by objective and also at the end of the book is a practice exam. What this book needs is a cd with more practice questions to be a truly effective tool.<br /><br />In Book 2, the Study Guide, you have a manual that covers every objective and gives you over 50 exercises. Along with that are tips, tricks and diagrams plus questions at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />The cd included has audio study so you can learn while driving, an e-book making this whole thing portable, CertTrainer for the e-training and ExamSim for the practice test mode.

I have always wished that there was some sort of lab manual for the Cisco Press books that would allow the student to be able to work with real world examples. Now with the release of  Practical Studies you have a handy study companion to work with.<br /><br />The 500 page book is more than just an ad-on reference manual it is a useful study tool for the new 640-607 exam. The authors went to a great deal of time and effort to make sure all exam objectives were covered and the material up to date and technically accurate.<br /><br />One thing I was impressed with is that this book fits right into any ICND training course because not only does it cover the exam it provide information for other CCNP exams as well. The breakdown examples use actual router code and show you what is happening throughout the examples.<br /><br />While this manual is for the intermediate to advanced user the material is tailored made for those ready to take the exam but need just a little more help. One drawback is that you will need a great deal of equipment in order to follow the examples and that's why a router simulator should have been included.<br /><br />Also the book does not have nay practice question software and this is something that should also be included in the learning process. The only other thing I saw was the inclusion of EIGRP routing protocol which the exam does not cover. Overall a few minor adjustments and this book are ready to use.	2002-04-24

MCSA is a new set of exams that Microsoft has added to the technical arena. I have begun to study for the exams and this set of books is a certainly going to help. While this set of books covers the 70-210,215,216 and 218 exams and is self paced there is a few minor updates needed.<br /><br />In book 1 the 210 exam, you learn to install, configure and administrate 2000 professional. You will work with hardware, desktops configurations, MMC, the control panel and troubleshoot. You have plenty of exercises to enhance the learning process.<br /><br />Book 2 the 215 exam, again you install, configure, administrate only this time it is for the server. Along with that you create shared resources, optimize, implement policies and troubleshoot, and again with exercises to show you what to do.<br /><br />Book 3 is the 216 exam, here you will learn about TCP/IP and the utilities like WINS, DNS, DHCP and others. Also you take a look at central and remote control management as well as security and communications.<br /><br />Finally comes book 4 the 218 exam, and in my opinion this book seemed to be the toughest to learn, which is why I am re-reading it. You manage resources, setup storage, rights and permissions as well as configure and troubleshoot.<br /><br />There is a cd included which has practice exams for each exam, but for the money there should be more included. Also a 120 day evaluation copy of the 2000 server is there, I also think 2000 Professional eval should have been included as well. Overall a few improvements and you have a great learning tool.	2002-04-24

One of the techniques I used to learn the CCNA material which helped me pass the exam was I created flash cards to cover the objectives. When I was asked to become a technical reviewer for this book I was more than willing and what you have is a very good product and study tool.<br /><br />There are over 400 flash cards in the book and they tackle each and every objective. The cd included has over 500 more questions to give over 900 questions for the new exam. The book also has over 50 pages of quick reference material covering the major points.<br /><br />Add this to  the Cisco Press collection of Practical Studies and the new Exam Guide and you most certainly have an unbeatable set of study material. Also on the cd you can customize the ecards for the exam or for an objective and the cards can be stored on a Palm device.<br /><br />Overall the author has a technically accurate and up to date set of questions to work with and you have a quick and handy reference manual.	2002-04-24

Having reviewed over 600 books in the past several years I am sometimes have to stop and recognize a truly exceptional book and this is one of those times. Having worked with TCP/IP for over 5 years, after reading this book I was amazed at how much I didn't know.<br /><br />While it is true this book is written for the UNIX/Linux environments, the principles involved will apply to almost any network environment. The 700 plus page book is very well written and extremely well documented, the author has certainly done his homework for this book.<br /><br />The breakdown of TCP/IP is excellent and there is great material for routing, security and troubleshooting as well. You have been given numerous examples to learn from and work with. Overall this book is certainly one to have around and a great addition to my technical library.	2002-04-24

In over 14 years of working in the IT industry I have been assigned to many projects, I have even been in charge of several of them. Until I read this book I was not aware of everything that goes into good project management. It is no surprise that Sybex has release the first and only book on the subject.<br /><br />The author seems to know his stuff in this 650 page book which is more than just a study guide for the exam, it is a manual that can and should be read by anyone planning or working as a project manager.<br /><br />Covering the 4 major exam domains and a map of those domains is right in the front of the book, you will start off with project management fundamentals which after reading has given me a better understanding of much time and effort it takes to make a project successful.<br /><br />You then move on to the project scope and how important this is to learn presentation skills, analysis and assessment techniques. From there you will learn how to setup, manage, control and run projects no matter the size or scope.<br /><br />Finally there is a section on the closing of the project and all this comes with review questions in every chapter as well as case studies. The cd, as with other Sybex manuals and practice tests, which are adaptable, flash cards and an e-book. Being first in this case is a very good thing.	2002-04-24

Having passed the CCNA Exam I naturally want to further my certification with the CCNP, I am currently studying the Routing exam and have several books. I found this book to be a nice addition to the material I already have.<br /><br />The book is 550 pages and the routing exam objectives are covered fully. The book has over 40 scenarios covering VLSM, routing basics, OSPF, IS-IS, EIGRP and BGP. The scenarios are not just walk through example you really need to think things out before beginning, a refreshing change.<br /><br />I also very much like the 1 14 hour study lab, as well as the review question at the end of each chapter.  Each scenario has code examples to follow and learn by and again with the lab you really have to think about what you are doing be fore proceeding forward.<br /><br />One tiny drawback is that there was no simulator, so you have to have access to equipment. If you are in a formal training setting this should be no problem. Overall a very good book	2002-04-24

Being that Microsoft has partnered with CompTia and allowed the Network+ exam to be used in the MSCA track, it is no surprise that they have updated the Network+ Training Guide to meet the new exam.<br /><br />However in this 700 page manual there is a definitive slant in the material to Microsoft. While every objective is covered and this is also a useful tool for the MCSA exams, be aware that the material is geared to the Microsoft environment.<br /><br />Overall you have over 45 exercises and a perfect tool for the classroom. What are missing are practice exams and for those not able to have equipment to work on, a simulator of some type would be a nice addition as well.<br /><br />It is well documented and the cd does have an e-book of the Encyclopedia of Networking and few improvements are needed in order to make this book a winner.	2002-04-24

Coriolis has become a trusted name in the certification arena and over the years I have either used their books to study from or teach class with. Over the years I have trusted them to provide accurate and detailed information in the exam preps series and cover the major points in the exam cram series.<br /><br />The set comes with 2 books, practice tests and the A+ exam cram, as well as a cdrom making this a very complete set of study material to work with. The Practice test book has 2 Core and 2 operating systems test and also a cd which can be customized for testing purposes.<br /><br />The exam cram book is over 600 pages filled with information that draws attention to the most important concepts and ideas of both exams. I found that there were very few typos and grammar errors, it was well documented and comes with hundreds of review questions, tips, tricks, notes and alerts for the exams.<br /><br />The cd has an e-book of the IT Certification success 4th edition. Overall this package needs some updating and should be coupled with the Exam Prep book, which would give you an unbeatable combination for success the very first time out.	2002-04-08

Recently I was asked to help a company convert several users from Windows 95 and 98 to Windows XP. The technicians who were going to provide support had little or no experience with XP. The company had used this series of books for 95, 98, NT Workstation and 2000 Professional so naturally they chose it for XP.<br /><br />Over the two weeks of using this book I found that as an instructor this book is a great manual for the classroom, providing the students with over 80 exercises as well as self tests and lab questions. In short this book made teaching the class easier for me and better for the students.<br /><br />Covering every test objective with topics ranging from installation, configuration and setup to hardware, networking and troubleshooting to desktop configuration, printing and faxing you have a very complete reference manual to work with.<br /><br />I liked the fact that the examples were more than just data they seemed to be examples from real world situations. The cd include has MasterSim include with another 40 plus hands on simulations for the students and PracticeSim with exam that not only test the student but also assess the progress.

Over the past 14 years I have always been told that with a wan you must have routers, but all that is changing with this book. What the author does is take a very complex subject and break it down into three sections over 1275 pages.<br /><br />With the information included you are able to either teach or learn about three type of Wan switching, MSSC, BSSC and MACC. With the information included you'll be able to work with and configure as well as administrate the networks.<br /><br />In Section 1 the author works with IGX concepts such as message formats, commands, voice and data, frame relay, ATM and troubleshooting. While some of the concepts and ideas are still a little unclear I have begun to learn a whole new way of switching.<br /><br />Section 2 is BPX networking and hardware with the use of SONET networks, routing with BPX environment as well as troubleshooting. Section 3 captures the MGX series with commands, SONET, ways to make connection and configure them and finally Voice and IP together.<br /><br />Each chapter does have review questions and from what I have seen nothing comes even close to matching the information included in this book. The author does a great job of documenting the information and overall the typos seem minimal.	2002-04-08

A+ has become the foundation by which almost all computer technicians are judged. Passing that exam, which is now adaptive, shows that you have the ability to work in most first level technical positions. Having taught the class several time over the past 10 years I am always looking for material to enhance the class.<br /><br />This book, while only 360 pages, makes a great addition to my technical library and an excellent reference manual to work with before taking the actual exams. The book covers both sets of objectives and gives you the ability to learn as you test.<br /><br />Section one of the book covers the 220-221 exam or the Core objectives, while section 2 covers the 220-222 exam or the operating system technologies.

I took the CIW Foundations exam over a year ago, I had almost nothing to study from and passing the exam was quite the challenge. Had I had this book I am confident that the exam would have been less trouble and made my life easier.<br /><br />The 860 page book tackles the 1D0-410 Foundations exam and after reading through it I found that it was tailored made for the exam, objective by objective. Detailed information is given and if you use this book I also found that you have enough information to pass the iNet+ exam from CompTia.<br /><br />In part 1 the author takes on the internet fundamentals with topics like browsers, search engines, plug-ins, security and e-commerce. Part 2 is dedicated to HTML both in the basic and some advanced techniques.<br /><br />The HTML covers versions 4 and 5 and the breakdown is in a step-by-step format with actual coding examples to work with. Also basic coverage of CSS, DHTML and XML  has been broken down into a understandable but technical manner.<br /><br />Part 3 is the networking fundamentals sections, with topics ranging from TCP/IP, OSI model, servers, security and disaster recovery to LANS, WANS and hardware and troubleshooting.<br /><br />Each chapter has exercises, questions, and labs to re-enforce the concepts and you can read and reread as often as necessary. There are also hundreds of resources included with every section.<br /><br />Finally there is a cdrom include with several network tools like Visual Route, but what I found most important was the practice tests include was from Boson, a highly respected name in testing software.  Overall this is by far the best book I have seen on the subject matter to date.	2002-04-08

A+ is the largest certification by number in the IT industry today, with over 600,000 certified technicians. Training for the exam is a mostly self study and practice exam, that's why it is so important to find the best material on the market.<br /><br />The training kit has 2 cd's that have over 6 hours of training videos available to view and review at your pace. The speaker(s) are easily understood and the clarity is very good as well. This kit makes a perfect companion to Peter's A+ book, and it is included in e-format on the cd.<br /><br />There is also over 200 practice questions included on the cds and I think this should have been a separate cd. The material covered does in fact go over each and every exam objective, plus more, as in the case of the operating systems covering 9X, ME, NTWS and 2000 Professional.<br /><br />Also included is a workbook for taking notes on any of the topics, which include troubleshooting, printers, which is an excellent breakdown, laptops, hardware and operating systems. I like the fact you can repeat lessons, also the fact you can skip around and customize the learning to your needs.<br /><br />As for the install, I was able to run the software on Windows 95, 98, ME, NT Workstation, 2000 Professional and XP Professional so there is no excuse for not learning. About the only drawbacks is the timing, this should have released closer to the newest exams, and the material should have been on DVD as well.	2002-03-25

In the world of networking it is very important to make sure and ensure that you have up to date information right at your fingertips. I have reviewed previous versions of this book and thought some of the information fell short of the mark, which is not the case this time as the author seems to have gone to great lengths to make certain what you read is as accurate as possible.<br />The book, which has over 1100 pages, has been written not any certification exam but will help with several exams like Network+, Server+ and Security+. Also I was impressed by the fact that the front and back covers are setup as quick reference cards, using every part of the book to provide technical information.<br />With 58 chapters broken down into 10 parts the author's attention to detail and technical accuracy make this book standout above other in the genre. You have section dealing with planning and designing. Over 100 pages on hardware, over 160 pages on network solutions like Ethernet and token ring.<br />The most impressive section was the 170 pages dealing with TCP/IP, a breakdown that would rival just about any book out there and the information is written for every technical skill level. There is also section on Network Operating systems, security, troubleshooting and upgrading and migration.<br />In the Appendixes there is an outstanding breakdown of the OSI model, TCP &amp; UDP ports and well as a very listing of resources. The cd included has networking utilities both free and demo versions. This is a great manual for all technicians and administrators alike, overall excellent	2002-03-25

The class was to go over the basic of each OS and the kicker was the class was to be 3 days long. With that many OSes it would have taken 3 days for installs alone, until I found VmWare.<br />With a basic understanding of the application I managed to teach the class, if I had this book then I would have been able to do so much more. Ward has simply put together the best book on the subject matter that I ever come across.<br />Starting right of the books delves into the virtual machine and the requirements for install and configuration. The author explains in detail what each version requires in order to have it working properly. Then there is over 100 pages just on the different guest system setups and configurations, again the author attention to detail makes this some of the most interesting reading of the book.<br />Then the book work with networking and stand alone operations making sure you have a good understanding of the differences. Finally the author gives several pages to the troubleshooting of the application. You have tips and tricks for each OS and  hints to avoiding problems before they happen.<br />Overall this book has already given me several tips and tricks to enhancing the classes I am teaching and I am sure that I will find many others before I am through.

Web design with Java was a very complicated concept for me to understand. I just couldn't grasp the logic behind the code. After reading this book, there are still some areas I have trouble understanding but for the most part I am now beginning to see just how powerful J2EE really is.<br /><br />Barish's 400 page manual is well documented and the author tries to keep the level of understanding to middle level technical person. While there are some sections that require a higher technical level, section like client/server communications require a lower level understanding.<br /><br />The book explains how request processing works, how to work with JDBC and SQL together, how to use Java beans and an  abundance of other topics. The author make sure that as much information as possible is included.<br /><br />The cd-rom included has code that pertains to section from the book and with the examples in the book, any developer should be able to have an excellent starting point. With a subject like this the manual could have been 3 or 4 times the amount of pages, the author has put together the most important points and what you have is the best I have seen.<br /><br />Overall I found this book to not only benefit myself and enhance my personal knowledge, but several of my friends have also read parts of the book and found it to be something they could use in the their jobs as well.	2002-03-21

I was hired by a client to teach a Network+ class, and the client had no idea what book to use, we decided on the book based on the reputation of the author and a previous version of the book.. After watching the entire class pass the exam first time I can now see why David Groth is an industry expert on the subject matter.<br />With over 550 pages, Groth has made very short work of the exam and the exam objectives. Beginning with the fundamentals of topologies, hardware and basic network elements. Groth then spends the next 50+ pages on the OSI model, the key element in networking.<br />Again as with the 2nd edition there are over 100 pages just for TCP/IP. Groth covers each objective of the newest exam, N10-002, and his detail and documentation are excellent, something that had become a standard with his work.<br />There are over 200 questions in the book to work with plus essential exam information has also been included.

Network+ is fast becoming necessary certification to gain employment as a basic network technician.

I didn't see any coverage of wireless technologies.<br /><br />Also included is over 125 pages devoted to TCP/IP and there are 12 exercises which so far of the books I have seen, is the most coverage for the network+ exam. I like the author's breakdown of security and his troubleshooting techniques are also very good.<br /><br />The book comes with a cdrom which has CertTrainer, a cbt review of the exam topics and objectives. Also ExamSim, a practice exam simulator with over 200 questions, plus over 200 in the book.

Need to find equipment but can't afford the costs? Want to have several different routers to work with? Think you'll need a new lab? Well Cisco Press may have taken the trouble to help you out more than you know.<br />With the software there was absolutely no trouble installing and I installed it on Windows 98, NT, 2000 and XP, each worked flawlessly. After the install you need the cd to run which should be changed in future releases.<br />Once installed you are ready to begin, although you do need to give the host of the console an IP address first and this too needs to be corrected. Seems to work far better that other routers eSIM since is isn't database driven but Flash driven. Giving you every possible help, the commands that are useful are bolded, aiding in the learning process.<br />There are 3 scenarios, scenario 1 is 5 router and 10 hosts. Although switches are included you can not configure them which I think would be very useful. In scenario 2 you work with switches and VLANS and 2 is intra-Vlan routing. You have several labs for each scenario and you can always make up your own.<br />The second cd included has over 100 activities and not all relate to CCNA but you'll find them useful for other things related to networking. There is also over 200 flash cards to study from and about the only problem I found is that you have to enter the full command rather than the shorter version.<br />There is some cleanup needed but you should be able to pass the exam with this one. Now tailor the ICND and CCNA courseware to this eSim and you have a sure fire winner.	2002-01-09

The next 65 pages are for ATM, ATM WAN, MPOA, cell and cell relay coverage. Other topics covered are VoIP, VPN, SMNP and network management and that gets you to chapter 24.<br />From there the author takes 110 pages to cover the routing protocols associated with Cisco routers, protocols like RIP, RIPv2, IGRP, EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS and BGP. The book is rounded out by IPv6 and Multiprotocol Label switching. I do think more coverage of switches and switching could have been included as well.<br />Several appendices were also included for things like Network Assessments, subnet masks and protocol lists. The book has several case studies included to help you understand the concepts presented as well as screen shots of the actual router code. Overall this is one great book to have and a great addition to my technical library.	2002-01-09

What I have found over the past several months is that a firewall is more important than I first thought. I have found that keeping unwanted traffic and visitors out is certainly more important than most people know or understand.<br />Working with Cisco routers there is really only one choice for firewalls and that is PIX, this 350 page book gives a first hand use, configuration and maintenance look at the PIX Firewall. Beginning with network security and moving to PIX software and hardware. You'll then work with the upgrading the PIX Software.<br />Next comes the configuration of PIX and ASA security levels commands. I found the firewall translation in both static and dynamic configurations, which include NAT and PAT, to be very useful in what I am doing currently.<br />Finally topics like firewall access, authentication, advanced protocol handling, like FTP and RTSP, attack guards, IPSec and proxy configuration round out one of the best books I have ever read. There is also labs and case studies to work with and if they developed and eSim to go with this there no telling how big it would be. Overall excellent.	2002-01-09

Starting<br />off the book is and overview of Linux and the Linux+ Certification followed up with networking.<br /><br />From there you'll move to hardware configuration of ESD, SCSI, IEEE1394 and troubleshooting. Moving on to the installation,<br />configuration and administration of Linux along with system administration and troubleshooting. I found this book to remain neutral in<br />the coverage and give you more than enough information.<br /><br />There are over 25 exercises, lab questions &amp; answers with the 2 minute drills in each chapter.

Having passed the CCNA exam last year and having taught the ICND class over the past several months I am always looking for new material to better the class. Finding this book has given me new ideas and labs to create for the class.<br />In over 400 pages, this book has a narrow focus on only the exam objectives. While the book does a good job of covering the exam for those with limited knowledge or exposure you'll need alternative resources for studying.<br />Covering the OSI model, media, cabling, the IOS and boot process, CDP, config register, bridging, switching, spanning tree, the 1900 switch, VLANs, TCP/IP and subnetting gets you about two thirds through the book.<br />From there static and dynamic routing, RIP and IGRP, access lists, WANS, including HDLC, PPP, ISDN, DDR and Frame Relay finish out the coverage. Each chapter has questions and answers.  There is also a cd with practice questions included and I think to make this the perfect study tool a router simulator should be included. Overall very good.	2002-01-09

When I passed the A+ Exam I used a lot of material to study from. I had no idea of Prentice Hall and this book and that's too bad. Whether striving for the certification of trying to become a better technician this book has something for everyone and all technical levels can benefits from what's contained in the book.<br /><br />While this edition is smaller that the previous one, don't let that sway you into thinking information may have been left out. Almost the opposite is true as I see every exam objective given more than enough coverage.<br /><br />Divided into two parts as are most A+ books, this one begin wi9th the hardware exam and tackles the topics like the boot process, upgrading and troubleshooting, safety, CPUs, motherboards, ram, printers, portables and finally networking.<br /><br />While the coverage for portables and printers is enough to pass the exam a little more information could have been included. From the part two is the operating systems exam. What I really like is the fact that DOS and Windows 3.X was included giving you a starting and reference point to today's operating systems.<br /><br />Also coverage of the Windows 95, 98 and ME, again this is something you find anywhere else, and Windows 2000 Professional, what I think may need to included is Windows NT Workstation. Memory and file management as well as networking and troubleshooting the operating systems rounds out the topics.<br /><br />There is review questions at the end of each chapter, but hands-on labs or exercises should have been included as well as a cd with practice test to allow you try before going live. Overall a decent study tool and this book should give you a good chance of passing the exam.	2001-12-16

While this book is written to any exam specifications you may it very useful for most if not all Cisco certification exams.<br /><br />Finally the book has over 300 pages devoted to the commands and there breakdown to give you the where to use, description and examples of the code. About the only thing left out was the entire book in e-book format or formatted for the palm. Overall this is one book I will have with for a very long time - well done!!!	2001-12-16

When I passed the CCNA exam a year ago I used the CCNA Study Guide by Todd Lammle and passed the exam with a 924. Had I had this book I am positive I would have done even better. Lammle is the first name in Cisco Certification exam material and judging from the content of the book there is no doubt why.<br /><br />Lammle approach to the exam is by far the best I know of and studying the book in the order presented gives you the best chance of passing the exam on the first try. With Internetworking basics like the OSI model and topologies like Ethernet are the very beginning to the CCNA certification.<br /><br />From there Lammle has you working with switching, which I like because switching should come before routing. Then you move to the internet protocols, IOS, IP routing VLANs and router management. Lammle again makes sure that far more information than the exam requires is included.<br /><br />After that you then start working with IPX, Access lists and then WAN protocols like HDLC, PPP, Frame Relay and ISDN. Each section has review questions, the new thing I am very happy to see is both written and hands-on labs.<br /><br />The cd included has over 400 practice questions, over 300 flash cards for both the PC and the palm devices and entire e-book. Lammle again takes the opening and adds not 2 but 4 additional bonus exams.<br /><br />Finally as part of the study process is the use of an actual router and since this can be an expensive investment, Lammle has given you a Router Fundamental Simulator and practice labs. All this in one book and at a price that should make everyone happy. Whether certified or not, whether looking to refresh you skills this book is a must have for every router technician.	2001-12-09

Cisco Press has produced a  software application that will enhance the study process and with their exam guides you have the perfect combination.<br /> <br />While the software is easy to install and I found no complications I did have to disable my anti-virus software first. The cd includes reading assignments and the complete CCNP is on the e-book included.<br /> <br />The software has a couple of modes starting with the study mode which allows you to take practice tests on a specific section before moving on. The thing I most like was the open book testing method this mode uses. It allows the candidate to learn and find the answers rather than just memorizing the questions and answers.<br /> <br />There is also a practice exam mode with one exam for the each of the four CCNP exams. Although the exams are very good and seem to cover the topics and objective very well for the money you have been given more practice exams.	2001-12-09

Broken down into four parts with part 1 covering the Windows 2000 Professional exam 70-210 with topics like install, configuration, administration, managing device, task manager, faxing, networking and tcp/ip.<br /><br />In part 2 you work towards the Windows 2000 Server, 70-215 exam, covering topics like administration, hardware configuration, working with system resources, networking and storage devices. Overall this section needs to be expanded and I could see more information for configuration and troubleshooting needed.<br /><br />Part 3 is the Networking or 70-216 exam tackling topics like DNS, DHCP, Remote Access, and IPSec, WINS, routing and networking fundamentals. Finally Part 4 covers Active Directory or the 70-217 exam.<br /><br />There is also a cd included with a practice exam for each exam, for the money there should be more exams to work with.

The A+ Exam has changed since I took it about three years ago. Since there is a need for each technician to make sure they are current with exam new books are required. Also if you are in pursuit of the certification it is a good idea to have a book that can help you out to give you that final prep you'll need. Either way this may the book to get a hold of.<br /><br />Mike Meyers is the most respected name in the A+ Certification arena and this is another example of how he has taken the opportunity to help you out. The 500 plus page manual starts of with the Hardware exam covering topics like COM/LPT ports, keyboards, mouse, video, audio, NICs, modems, USB and SCSI.<br /><br />From there you'll covers exam objective like ESD, and Safety, EMI and hazard material, motherboards, power supplies, memory, buses, processors from the Pentium to the Pentium 4, although I think coverage of the older CPU might also be helpful.<br /><br />Different types of RAM such as DRAM, SRAM, EDO and FP, IDE and SCSI hard drives, I/O Addressing, IRQs and finally DMAs. Installation, configuration and troubleshooting, portable, printer and networking round out this section.<br /><br />In the Operating Technologies section DOS, Windows 9.X, NT Workstation and 2000 Professional are given their coverage. Again adding Windows 3.X could only help but does not subtract anything by being left out. Networking and troubleshooting finish out this section as well.<br /><br />There is also a cd included with 2 practice exams and overall this book does cover each objective very well. Used with Mike Meyers All in One Certification guide you may just have the unbeatable combination.	2001-12-09

Since it is a two part exam and since Cisco wants to ensure only the most qualified pass you are going to need study material and this All-In-One guide is a great place to begin.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the size, only 400 pages may seem to be a very short accounting of the exam, but the fact of the matter is this book is a great example of the idea that small packages can produce enormous results.<br /><br />Rather than the usual objective breakdown this book is four exams that you can use for qualification before the actual exam. The first exam is network fundamentals with question covering the OSI model, PPP, HDLC, switching, ATM ISDN and IP.<br /><br />Exam 2 is routing, routed and routing protocols like RIP, IGRP, EIGRP, OSP and IS-IS.

I have been involved in a network redesign and I was looking for a book that had enough information to help me understand firewalls, Nat and other network security techniques. I found this book to be very helpful in enlightening me to the world of network security.<br /><br />Starting this book is firewalls, denial of service, VPNs, floodgates and NAT. Information that has made the redesign easier for me and the understanding was in terms I was able to comprehend. The book then goes on to talk about the install and configuration of Firewall-1.<br /><br />Moving at a pace that I set I was then reading about network objects and the management of the objects like TCP, UDP, RPC, ICMP, SMTP and FTP. After that the designing of the rule base was the next section to cover. This section covers the three rules most people work with, Stealth, Cleanup and implicit.<br /><br />I think that the most important thing I learned about was the remote administration and NAT. Finishing up the book is the authentication and encryption section followed up with monitoring and performance tuning. Although tailored to a specific exam the book has given me better insight into the world of firewalls and overall a very good book.	2001-12-09

I think there should have bee more coverage the XP Home version to make this the complete go to reference.<br /><br />Broken down into seven parts Part I is for deployment and the strategy involved with deployment. Part II is Desktop support including backups, printing, faxing, mobile user support, disk and file management and maintenance.<br /><br />Part III gives you a detailed look at the security, encryption and authentication policies and procedures for XP.

Nothing has become more important to computer networking than security, keeping out those things that are not need for the operations intended. O'Reilly Publishing has put together an excellent choice for administrators to help them ensuring that what needs to stay out stays out.<br /><br />Do not be fooled by the small size of the book or the fact that the book has only 250 pages, the manual is packed with information that is the key to creating and using access lists.

I passed the CCNA exam over a year ago and since that time I have been working with routers both as a network administrator and an instructor. Recently I worked with someone looking to connect all his WAN location with switches and I finally found a book, the only book to cover this are. Naturally Cisco Press was the publisher.<br /><br />Covering Exam 640-410, CCNA WanSw, the book does a fairly good job of breaking down the exam and the objectives. In Part I, the Quick Start, you cover topics like Serial communications, narrow and broadband including J1, T1, Y1, DS3, E3 and SONET circuits, digital voice. Also Frame Relay with DLCI, IARP and NNI is covered.<br /><br />Finally the section breaks down ATM and cell technology, IP addressing in both the classless and classful environments. With Part II, the installation of the switches, the 8400, 8600, 8550 and 8220 are the primary focus.<br /><br />Wan switching topologies and technologies like flat, tiered and structured topologies are tackled first. Then you move onto IGX and BGX switches, troubleshooting and the alarms sections. Overall the book does cover the exam but there is very little coverage  of the commands needed or no practice exam questions on a cd-rom.<br /><br />Since this the only choice out there you do need this and I think it will help greatly but updates are needed.	2001-11-04

The information has screen shots to show you what things should look like.<br /><br />After that you move in the always challenging world of TCP/IP with routing protocols and access lists. This section has a great deal of information but you may want to check other sources for more detailed information.<br /><br />You also go into areas like AppleTalk with LAN and WAN configuration, IPX, SAP and basic management of the router including time control. While most of the book is geared towards the beginner all skill levels should be able to find some useful information within the book.<br /><br />I found that the information seems to be up to date including topics like Network Time Protocol and Simple Network Time Protocol. Overall a very good value for the money.	2001-10-04

With Cisco Certification becoming more in demand every day, you need an edge in obtaining the certification. Coriolis, a known leader in certification study material has put together a testing package that allows you to try before going live.<br /><br />Covering exams 640-503, 504, 505 and 506 the package includes over 400 questions divided up between the 4 exams. While this may seem like a great deal of question in reality it's about 100 per exam and for the money I think you should be given more.<br /><br />Although the questions do cover the exam objectives, it doesn't a long time to go through them. I like the idea that you can do online downloads to obtain more question, but as stated before for the price the data bank should be full.<br /><br />The software was a snap to install and with Windows 98, NT, ME and 2000 there was no problems. I would recommend disabling any virus software to ensure a smooth install.<br /><br />The testing software can be taken in review mode to learn as you go or in either the real mode with no time limits or the simulator mode to give you the feeling of the actual exam. Overall add a few more questions and this is a great learning tool.	2001-10-04

Recently I had trouble with a ping flood at work and I had to create an access list on the router in order to stop the intruder. I was unable to find any information as to how to stop just the ICMP protocol for pings, which was until I found this book.<br /><br />While this book may be small in pages, only 260, it is indeed rich in information, with over 100 examples of access lists. Making it easier to understand what to do and what things will look like when complete screen shots of the router code are also included.<br /><br />With a small section on the overview of the router you quickly begin coverage of both IP standard and extended access lists. You also create the dynamic, reflexive, and time based access lists.<br /><br />There is information on context and base access control and well as NAT and IPSec and in my case, coverage of the IMCP access lists. There could have coverage of IPX lists but this will not detract from the usefulness of the book in any way.	2001-10-04

In working with computer and teaching web design for over the past three years there is always new ways to learn something you never knew before. This book has provided me with new ideas and techniques but overall there's not anything that makes it standout from the rest of the pack.<br /><br />In the 270 pages topics like design, e-commerce, layout, web tools, text and page building, graphics, color and structure, table, frames and layers as well as multimedia, hyperlinks and lists are usually what come with any design book.<br /><br />Also this book in not in color and the areas like CSS, DHTML and image maps were not included.

What Limbaugh has the inside story to the Clinton administration? What Limbaugh has an insight into what Janet Reno knew? What Limbaugh has taken an objective view of the past 8 years? I know you're thinking Rush, but you may be surprised to find out it's his brother David and this book may also be a surprise.<br /><br />When I first started reading this book I thought another book that tells about the scandals and the spin machine from the beltway, and the book does that, but it also brings to light some very interesting information that may have and has been kept from the public until now.<br /><br />Limbaugh shows how the Administration put itself above the law of the land, what the justice department knew and kept secret, what Janet Reno knew or didn't know as the White House turned information over to her.<br /><br />You'll read about how Elian Gonzales was a political pawn in a masterful chess game run by Bill Clinton, how the Clinton administration ignored Senate confirmations and tried to shut up and down big tobacco.<br /><br />You'll read and understand how people's lives were ruined if they disagreed with the Clinton Administration, the cover-ups and other scandals like Monica, Vince Foster and White Water.<br /><br />Overall this is not a Clinton bashing book but rather a book about what bashing the Clinton's did during the 8 years in power. This Limbaugh may have finally hit the nail on the head.	2001-06-10

There are certain people who have written books about the Clintons and the Clinton administration and the unfair bias of the book made it impossible to finish. Christopher Ruddy is not one of those people. His exceptional talent for the truth with an objective point of view is what allowed me to finish this book in just under 2 hours.<br /><br />Ruddy is relentless in his pursuit of the truth about the Clinton Administration and his ability to reveal the stories that the liberal press left out is simply some of the best reporting I have read in a very long time, after reading the book you'll be asking yourself why you never heard this information before.<br /><br />Ruddy busts through the blind press to give you stories about the Teamster scandal, Chinagate, Janet Reno and what she did to help cover-up scandals. Ruddy also shows that the Monica scandal was more than a \\"personal\\" affair and it's only the tip on the iceberg in the sex scandals throughout the political life of Bill Clinton.<br /><br />Ruddy is more than a reporter, he's a pit bull when it comes to uncovering what the media has hidden. His capacity to stop the ever running spin machine and give you the true story is what Chris Ruddy is all about.<br /><br />From insights into the real Bill and Hillary to the strange deaths of Ron Brown and Vince Foster, to the media bias, to the selling of secrets to China and the illegal campaign contributions this book is filled with interesting and sometime amazing stories. Very well done Christopher Ruddy!!!!!	2001-06-10

Robert Larson's CCNA book is well written and detailed far beyond the exam objectives of the CCNA exam. His knowledge of the subject matter is exceedingly evident with each page and each chapter. The drawback to the book is the timing, this book should have been released several months back.<br /><br />The 1,100 page reference manual starts off with the standards and the importance of why we have these standards. Then comes the OSI model breakdown, hitting the exam objectives right on the head. Next you get and look into topologies and access methods.<br /><br />I was impressed with the breakdown of IP addressing, subnetting and NAT. The author really knows what he is talking about. Excellent coverage is provided for in the Router commands, setup and configuration sections.<br /><br />Other areas covered are NOS, ACLs, switching, WANS, PPP, ISDN and Frame Relay. Included at the end of each chapter is review questions and there is a cd with hundreds of practice questions. If the timing was better the book would be a best seller.	2001-06-10

Study for the MCSE 2000 and think you ready for the actual exam? Want to make sure you have done the final prep? The readiness review may be the answer to those questions and more.<br />The complete set covers the four core exams as well as the accelerated exam. The books are made for the final prep and not for those looking for the one stop answer; you'll need other material along with this set of books.<br />Breaking down each exam objective the topics discussed is in an exam cram like design followed up with a few review questions. There are screen shots to bring a more visual effect to the learning environment and overall the information is good.<br />There are too many topics to list but a few are installation and configuration of Windows 2000 Professional and Server, DNS, DHCP and active directory. The cd-rom included has practice tests on all 4 exams.<br /><br />Overall Microsoft bundle a nice package and the prices is good. The software installed without a hitch and worked with Windows 95, 98, NT and 2000.	2001-05-13

I look back at my childhood and there were times when I thought I had it so rough it couldn't get any worse. Then after reading Orphan I realized I had it pretty good and I was lucky to have a family.<br />Kiser's book makes me appreciate what I had and what I have as he takes you on a journey from his trouble childhood to his adult life. This book was some of the best reading I have come across in a long time.<br />Follow along with the trials of being shifted from foster homes and the tribulations encountered along the way and you too will see that this book makes you see things about family life in a whole new light.<br />The book took me just over 3 hours to read and the reading was interesting and capturing. The book is good for all ages and after reading this you'll be gin to root for the underdog.	2001-05-13

In networking you have to understand certain concepts and those concepts are crucial to becoming a valued network technician. I have seen or read many books on networking but until now I hadn't read one so detailed.<br />This book literally takes a chapter for each layer of the OSI model and breaks it down. Starting with the physical layer and then to the Data Link layer which has chapters for the 2 sublayers as well.<br />You'll see where protocols fit into what layer, how security is affected at what layers, where routing algorithms figure out paths and which protocols to use. The author simply amazed me with the amount of information this book covered.<br />The book covered it all including IPv6, Java, ATM, FDDI, Routers, SLIP, HDLC and so much more. This is certainly a great addition to my personal technical library.	2001-05-13

I have been trying to learn JavaScript for over 6 months now and the while I understand the basics the more advanced features are still a mystery to me. That was until I found the Book Of JavaScript.<br />Broken down to the beginner level and starting with a very basic introduction to JavaScript I found that I was able to understand the concepts as well as retain them. After the intro you move to functions such as the alert prompt. The author does a good job of making sure you understand before moving on.<br />You'll also cover topics like rollovers, manipulating windows and then begin to write your own functions. Also covered in the book is forms, arrays and loops as well as setting up timing events, frames, I mage maps, cookies and DHTML.<br />One thing I really liked about this book was the author's breakdown of how to fix broken code. After spending time working with the book I can now see why it sold over 20,000 in the first two months.<br /><br />The cd-rom include has a demo of Dreamweaver 3.0, Adobe Go Live 4.0 and an assortment of other software. Overall this book is by far one of the best I have worked.	2001-05-13

Scott Mueller is a well respected name in the computer industry and I was hoping that this book would make an excellent reference manual for the A+ classes I teach. While this book is updated to the newest exam it falls short of being the go to book I was looking for.<br />The information presented in the book is good and the attention to detail makes the accuracy of the book very good. However you need the have Scott's 12th Edition of Upgrading and Repairing PCs as a backup to this text.<br />The book does covers topics like motherboards, CPUs, RAM, CMOS and BIOS, storage device, portables, safety, Operating Systems, troubleshooting and networking but the information only scratches the surface.<br />There are also hands-on exercises and review questions, which needs to be expanded. The cd-rom included also has a test engine and lab exercise but overall you will need other material in order to pass the exam.	2001-05-13

Over the past 20 years I have been reading over 35 books on the JFK assassination and the information presented has basically been the same in each book. That was until now, James Fetzer has written a book that brings to light new evidence and new ideas and this book is certainly one to have.<br />Over 465 page updated with the most current information available the author takes you back to that fateful day in Dallas and brings to life one of the most tragic and horrific murders in American history.<br />The book makes you see things differently and is very eye opening in the approach to the evidence. The author's breakdown of the day of the shooting is nothing short of amazing and his attention to the details makes the reading go very fast, I finished the book in just over 3 hours.<br />There is complete examination of the medical evidence and the roll of the Secrete Service and well as a comprehensive assessment of the Zapruder film, frame by frame. Also the author's inspection of photographs, medical reports and other evidence makes this one of the most complete works around.<br /><br />After sifting through the entire manuscript and objectively examining what you read you may be able to put to rest the mystery once and for all. Overall one the best book on the subject I have ever read.	2001-05-13

I know what classroom training cost and I understand that shelling out money for a class that may or may not help is certainly something no one wants to do. I also understand that if Windows 2000 Professional is a certification goal than this training kit may be the place to start you journey.<br />The book has over 90 lessons, from installing to the control panel, registry, protocols, DNS, active directory, configuration, administration, troubleshooting and remote access to help you in becoming the MCP you've always wanted.<br />The lessons are in a step by step method and you learn at your own pace, thus allowing you to repeat lessons if you need to. There is also a readiness review book included to put the final touches on the learning process.<br />The 3 cd-roms included are 1 for 120 day evaluation of Windows 2000 Professional, 2 is for the supplemental course materials and 3 is for the Sample Tech Net.

A+ certification has been revised and everybody now taking the exam must find new training material. Microsoft Press has put together a book that will help you pass the exam once you understand that this book has a tilt towards the Microsoft way of thinking.<br />Completely updated for the newest exam the self=paced course is very useful in shoeing the user what they need to accomplish in order to pass the exam. The drawback to the self study is you need to provide the equipment and this can get expensive,<br />Overall you learn at your pace and although there is no review questions this text still provides excellent reference material. You'll cover topics such as number conversions, CPUs, power supply, motherboards and bios, hardware, laptops, networking, operating systems and troubleshooting.<br />The cd-rom included with the book has videos to enhance the learning process, the entire text in electronic format. What are not included are practice tests to allow the user to have the chance of seeing the exam before taking it.<br /><br />If Microsoft makes a few changes and updates the cd-rom this book would be one to have. Overall the items missing may make it hard for the technician to compensate for.	2001-05-13

I teach computers and computer repair and determining what text book to use is a tough decision since there are a number of great books to choose from. Scott Mueller 12th edition is certainly on of the best going and this makes the choice even tougher.<br />Starting off the book with key vendor contacts is only the beginning of what has to be one of the most comprehensive books out there today. Mueller puts a great deal of information in 1625 pages.<br />Covering motherboards, buses, bios, memory, drives, video, i/o devices, internet, networking, sound cards, printers, scanners, configuration, upgrading, maintaining, troubleshooting and repairing there is information for every technician no matter what the level.<br />Mueller's breakdown of each topic excellent and the information is more than enough to help out anyone.

Having had a hand in the review of the book this text is vastly improved over the previous 2 editions. Major changes and updates were made to the manuscript and the results were outstanding.<br />Part 1 of the book is the Core hardware section and the breakdown of the motherboards, memory, hard drives, cd-roms and other computer hardware is excellent. Brooks has put together a book that rivals all others.<br />Part 2 is the Operating Systems section with coverage of DOS, Windows, 95, 98, NT workstation and 2000 Professional. The breakdown is by exam objective there is more material here than is required for the exam.<br />Finally part 3 the Final Review loaded with study and exam tips to ensure you have more than enough information to pass the exam on the first try.

December 7, 1941 is one of the most famous days in American History. For me most of what I know about has either come from books or movies. I did visit the Arizona Memorial when I was in the Navy and nothing compares to the feeling you get when you are there.<br />This book is more that a history with pictures, it tells small stories about the men and women who were there and what they went through. It shows photographs of the battles, the ships, the men the Americans and the Japanese, simply put it was a great reading.<br />There are over 200 pictures and some of them have never been seen before this book. Also there are paintings and the stories are told in the first person to give you the feeling of actually being there.<br />While the event is 60 years old the memories last a lifetime and this book will make a great addition to my personal library. Now when my kids ask about that faithful day I can open up this book and show them.	2001-05-13

Each entry includes the correct URL and a brief description of the Web Site .<br />What you don't get is an electronic version of the book with an ability to update on a regular basis. Like any yellow pages this book is only as accurate as those putting it together and having to buy this book year may not be the value you think it is.<br />At the end of the book is an index that cross references the entire book, overall there are a couple of improvements needed and this book should have parent approved section.	2001-05-13

After passing the CCNA exam I decided to pursue the CCDA certification and since the exam was developed by Cisco, why not use their material in order to pass the exam. What I found in this prep library is 3 of the best books out on the market.<br />While there  is no one saying which book to start with, I recommend the Internetworking Technologies Handbook as the place to start. Starting with the basics, then LAN protocols, then WAN technologies, bridging and Switching,  network protocols and finally routing protocols gives you the foundation to build on.<br />I then moved to the Designing Cisco Networks book, which can be used in a classroom without a hitch. This book covered topics like business solutions, designing topologies, building and testing prototypes and even has a sample exam and case studies.<br />Rounding out the set is the CCDA Exam Certification Guide which helps prepare you for the actual exam with topics like Applications, customer support, topologies and LAN design, Wan Design, documentation and case studies.

I went looking for material for CCDA and stumbled across this book. What I found was 400 plus pages of information making the passing of the CCDA exam easier and the learning were enjoyable.<br />Covering the 640-441 exam the book is broken down into 6 parts covering 11 chapters. Starting off with the OSI model and then on to design concepts and models. You then move right into identifying the customers needs and quickly follow up with hardware for LANS and WANS.<br />There is excellent coverage of addressing along with protocols, management and testing and a very good coverage of the IOS. The author includes 5 case studies to further help you understand the concepts of the book.<br />The book comes with a cd-rom with over 200 questions and the install was a snap. The book and cd are setup for a classroom situation and the software can be taken as a straight forward exam or in the adaptive mode.<br /><br />You can track your results as well as a history of your success.

As a technical instructor I find more and more people want to learn on there own, yet the software that allows this falls far short of providing accurate up to date information. This interactive video course is good but it needs updating to the newest exams.<br />Installing and running was simple and there were no hitches with 95 and 98. It uses quicktime video so you have to have that in order to run. If you have the Moulton's A+ book this makes and excellent companion.<br />Topics like components, buses, hard drives, logicboards, cpus, memory, printers, networking, communications, DOS, Windows, 95 and 98, troubleshooting are a few of the areas you'll find information for. Again this course covers the old exams and although it does have great information, you'll need other material.<br />Each section of the course does have questions you have to answer before moving on. Once this updated I am sure this course will be a topseller.	2001-05-13

If you have a working environment that uses DOS, 95, 98, NT, 2000, OS/2, BeOS, Linux and Unix and you were in charge of taking care of them you would need several computers to support this task and that could be very expensive. Roderick Smith has other plans and the cost is very small.<br />Learning from someone with over 10 years of experience in multi-boot environments this book gives you the breakdown of how to make them all work together and the dos and don'ts to look for.<br />Smith shows you how to use boot loaders and ways to partitions your hard drive for success. You'll also learn how to install the multiple operating systems and have them working in harmony.<br />Smith covers the cross platform issue you might face and what happens to the applications. There is coverage of TCP/IP and file and printer sharing. Finally Smith shows ways to optimize and configure your hard drives for the best situation.<br /><br />Included is a cd with VMware, Partition Magic and Boot Magic.

When I took my A+ tests I used the second edition of Mike Meyers book. This choice was based on a recommendation from several people and I was certainly glad I did. Now that I am a technical instructor there is no doubt as to what I will use on the classroom to help the students pass the newest exam - the third edition.<br />Mike Meyers is the master of the A+ exam and this book is loaded with more than enough information to pass the exam. After reading through the book I can now understand what made this book one of the most anticipated books, the author simply covers everything in great detail and makes sure you are fully prepared for the exam. About the only thing this book doesn't do is take the exams for you.<br />Updated to the newest exam, this 1260 page book starts with the breakdown of the pc, moves on to microprocessors, ram, bios and motherboards, buses, power supply, modems, printers, portable computers, storage systems, cd-roms, sound and video.<br />Thinking you might be done, not even close. Meyers then breaks down operating systems starting off with DOS, and then to Windows 3.X and 9.X. Excellent coverage for NT and 2000 are also a major part of this book. Finally you have coverage of the networking side of things and the information goes far beyond the A+ arena.<br /><br />Normally this would be enough material and information for anyone, but what separates Mike Meyers from the rest of the pack is the other things his books include. There is review Questions, information beyond the A+ objectives, pictures, figures, tables, screen shots and even a pull out poster of the motherboard.<br /><br />Every section is detailed yet easy to follow and understand and comprehend. The book includes a cd-rom that has 6 practice tests, if this is not enough you can go to the Total Seminars website and order more. There are video clips, tools and utilities for technicians completing and rounding out what I would say is probably the best and must buy for every technician on any level.nician on any level.	2001-03-18

I have been working with web page and web page design for about two years and I also teach the design of pages through HTML and FrontPage. For most people they need more than 1 or 2 days in a classroom in order to understand the concepts and this is where this book comes in handy.<br />Using the color photos of screen shots in order to make the understanding better, this book is broken down into 3 parts. Part 1 is the basics, helping you crawl in web design before you run. You'll be treated to topics like the elements of the web page, adding graphics, which include types of art, colors, pixels, photos, drawings, backgrounds and bullets.<br />Part 2 is the creation of the web page, which deals with subjects like posting, HTML layout, using Microsoft Word and FrontPage as web editors. The ideas and techniques for both Word and FrontPage are well explained and the screen shots included make it easier to visualize what the final outcome will look like.<br />Part 3 is the going live phase of the design, with the uploading of pages with the FTP protocol and web page updating after you have gone live. The hands-on really starts in part 2, which may be a drawback to the book, but overall information wise this book will transform the novice designer into a serious web master in no time flat.	2001-03-18

When it comes to upgrading a computer there are a number of ways to add hardware, but what if you want to make it faster using only the hardware the computer comes with? This book is tailored made for you and you can have that fastest pc on the block.<br />The authors' start off with the BIOS and the setup of the computer, they also delve into the BIOS Update and what to do and not to do. The next thing you read about is the optimization and compressing of the hard drive. While I don't agree with drive compression, the authors present a fairly good argument in favor of the technique.<br />Then you get to the meat of the book with the ability to over clock the CPU, from Intel 286 to the P3, and they also include Cyrix and AMD. Further they discuss the over clocking of the video and motherboards. There are examples of the techniques discussed and tips and hints are also included.<br />While the book details things can make the user dangerous if there is no experience, they also explain the do's and don'ts of the ideas. I personally don't find the over clocking to be a viable solution to speed after seeing what can happen if it done wrong, but as a repair technician I like the money it brings in.<br /><br />Over all the authors are very complete and detailed in the information presented, they include tables, diagrams, figures and examples to make sure you have the right information at your fingertips.	2001-03-18

The book also includes photos of each of the players. This is for every baseball fan young and old - excellent work and well done!!	2001-01-14

In my reviewing I have been fortunate to read a number books on various subjects. I have also been lucky enough to be asked to review several books on subjects I have very little knowledge and without exception I have been pleasantly surprised to learn new things along the way.<br />Dr. Lee is an author that takes the reader to a new level of understanding of spiritual healing and his book gives evidence as to why the healing process is more than doctors and nurses but a very real human characteristic.<br />My concept of healing leads me to believe that man is the reason we get better and Dr. Lee shows that this is not always the case and that my preconceived notion of what spiritual healing was could not be farther from the truth.<br />Lee is well documented and his arguments are backed up with ideas that require the reader to be open minded in order to grasp the concepts put forth in this exceptional work. Lee proves that spiritual healing is not just some crackpot science.<br /><br />Lee's book shows the differences between eastern and western medical and philosophy ideas and Lee certainly has proven to me that he knows what he is talking about.	2001-01-14

The toughest certification to obtain is the CCIE and that's because of the exam 350-001 and the practical involves over 6 hours. In my reading of technical books routing and switching concepts for the CCNP were complex and the CCIE will take this knowledge one or two levels higher.<br />This is a 490-page exam cram with the Cram Sheet to start you off. There are tips throughout the book and the practice questions even have trick question with explanation to help you out.<br />The topics covered begin with network theory, which is the OSI model, bridging and LAN Switching. Then you move to network technologies like Ethernet, all types, token ring, FDDI and CDDI.<br />Right after that you learn about TCP/IP Networking concepts like CIDR, ARP, RARP, addressing and subnetting, NAT and HSRP services. The routing and switching algorithms for routing protocols is covered.<br />The book next moves to network and design protocols like IPX, AppleTalk, IP, DecNet, and NETBIOS. Security, Wan Technologies of HDLC, DDR, Frame Relay and ATM and Cisco device operations finish up this book.<br />There is so much information covered in this book and remember this the exam cram, I am looking forward to the exam prep, which will have even more information.	2000-12-29

Just finishing learning HTML only to find that XML is now more widely accepted and you need a book to help you learn what this language has to offer. Stop looking and get a hold of the book Inside XML and you'll find a world of information enclosed in the 1000 plus pages.<br /><br />The author takes chapter 1 to break down XML resources and validators, then has chapter 2 delve into well formed documents with great detail, making sure that no stone is left unturned and that you have every bit of information at your disposal.<br /><br />Move on to topics like DTD, basics of java scripting, CSS, XSL and DOM. The author goes beyond the scope of the book to give you coverage of XHTML 1.0 and 1.1. Then is that's not enough the author adds information on VML, WML, ASP, JSP and perl languages making this one complete manual.<br /><br />Using great examples to learn from as well as an abundance of diagrams and figures you have everything you need. The book is made for the designer with intermediate to advanced HTML and java Scripting understanding.<br /><br />About the only thing the author has missed with is there's no cd-rom with working examples to allow you to practice with. Although there is ample examples in the book, this should not detract from the books overall value and worth.	2000-12-20

Inet+ is an exam that has been around for about 6 months and there are several books to help you study from. Jean Andrews has put together a great study and reference manual, however the timing is what may keep this from becoming more widely accepted.<br /><br />In 675 pages the entire set of INET+ objectives are covered completely, but again this book is just a little short in the timing area. With the material covered this book should and can help anyone who has yet to take the exam.<br /><br />One thing I noticed was the book does not cover the exam in any certain order and some of the chapters appear to be out to objective order. There are hands-on labs that will help you understand the concepts more clearly.<br /><br />This book is made for a classroom environment as it assumes you have certain equipment available. Also include are tips and review questions and it is fairly easy to follow the chapters and material.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Jean Andrews has a tremendous grasp of the subject matter. Overall a good value for the money.	2000-12-03

Routing is one area of networking where I can never get enough information. Teaching classes it is imperative to make sure that the students get every bit of information available, this mentor is a sure fire way to get this info to the students.<br />The cd-rom auto started under Windows 98, NT and 2000 and there is no install per say, once the cd starts you are ready to go. The application is web driven and under IE the application ran without error, under Netscape the program crashed twice during the running. After updating to Netscape 4.76 the application ran with fail.  The program comes with a Cisco Connection for on-line study. There are five labs included and the labs are tailored for the advanced IP routing of the CCNP and CCIE exams.<br />Lab 1 deals with the configuration of Frame Relay and frame relay backbones. Labs 2 &amp; 3 deal with OSPF, lab 4 is EIGRP and EIGRP filtering. Finally lab 5 gives you chance to setup BGP, EBGP and IGP.<br />Probably the best lab setup I have used, with instruction, objectives and directions before you begin each lab, coupled with on-line help. Best part is that you can re-do all labs over and over again and you work at your pace.	2000-11-30

In the past year I have reviewed a number of books that cover routing, Cisco, CCNA and TCP/IP. Cisco IP Routing Handbook is the first to bring the topics together and make it easy to understand while at the same time delivering quality information.<br />In this 500 plus page reference manual you start off with a great breakdown of IP routing and the different types of routing. The author make easy work of how routing functions and what you need in order to make routing occur.  Then the book breaks down the RIP protocol very well, however the book should have included RIP2 and what the similarities and differences are and how to use them separately and together.<br />The section on IGRP and EIRGP is also excellent, taking you from the basic understanding right through troubleshooting. This is the first book I have seen that was able to do this and do it well, although both protocols could have been given separate chapters for more detail.<br />OSPF is another protocol this book delves deeply into and this is by far the best breakdown of the topic. The configuration section is highly informative and for the most part easy enough to follow without getting lost.<br />The BGP Protocol section is broken down to explain, in great detail, what is required to make this protocol work both an IBGP and EBGP. The advanced configuration section leaves nothing out and the troubleshooting section give clear, concise explanations of how to make the protocol work and work correctly.<br />Other section of their book covers topics like static and default routing, redistribution routing and DDR. Each section sheds enormous light on the best methods and ways to make sure your routers are setup and running properly.<br />Finally the appendicles included cover access list configuration, routing with VLANs, which could have been given a section in the book if the information was expanded.  About the only drawback, and a very small one, is there was no real coverage of TCP/IP and subnetting, which if included would add more value to the book.<br />Overall this book can be used as a handy reference manual and a study guide for Cisco tests. The price is small in comparison to what you get., which if included would add more value to the book.<br />Overall this book can be used as a handy reference manual and a study guide for Cisco tests.

Router and routing protocols are fast becoming the certification path many  people are taking. Learning TCP/IP and subnetting is most confusing if you  don't understand the basis and the basics. IP Routing Protocols is a first  rate work that will make sense of the whole thing.<br />The book is written to  the more network savvy users and it's important that you have this  understanding before beginning. Once you get into the book you'll find a  world of information all packed into 280 plus pages. While the book does  start off with the basic of internetworking, again the better understanding  you have the easier it will be to grasp the more complex concepts.<br />You'll  get router discovery principles, bridges and internetworking basics and  then you will start with the routing protocols. RIP. OSPF, BGP, IGRP and  EIRGP as well as PNNI are covered in the next seven chapters. The author  includes a number pictures, figures and diagrams to help you see visually  what he it talking about.<br />There are appendices that cover the OSI layered  protocols, address resolution, subnetting subnet masking, translation and  configuration.

What makes Cisco Certifications one of most sought after certifications in the computer  industry? Where can you find a reference manual for Cisco that covers more  than just one certification topic? Try Cisco Router Handbook.<br />What amazed  me about this book was amount of information included. Also the author's  ability for detailed information is another huge plus to buying this book.  Sackett makes sure that every topic is covered completely and the  information is not accurate but up to date.<br />Starting off with the IOS  software and then moving into router hardware. The router hardware section  covers most if not all of the Cisco line. Next you have network design and  IP routing design, both sections are very well laid out and the information  is easy to follow.<br />  With other sections on Frame Relay, ATM, switch networks, SRB,  APPN, ISDN and DDR design rounding out the field. You have the author  giving you chapters devoted to the IP, RIP, IGRP, EIRGP, OSPF and BGP  Routing Protocols, more than any other book I have seen so far.<br /><br />Finally there are section on Novell and IPX, route distribution and  legacy systems which when you boil it all down covers CCNA to CCIE exams  all in 900 pages. While the cost is around $70.00 your money is well spent  for possible the one reference book that every Cisco technician should have  with them.	2000-08-20

In most cases you have a huge advantage over everyone else in terms of how people can reach  you. Build your own home network has some help for you, but you are better  off looking for complex answers some where else.<br />While this book can and  does introduce the neophyte to networking, it may give the user the  impression that they are ready to tackle even more complex networks than  they are capable of. The book skims over most topics giving just  information to make any end user dangerous.<br />The book cover three basic  topics, networking concepts, gathering parts and installing the network.  There is no section on troubleshooting, so if problem arise you are on your  own. While the pictures and diagrams are useful home networking is more  than connecting a cable to a card, this book doesn't show that.<br />What may  be needed in the next edition is more detailed information about  networking. For $24.99 the price does not outweigh the expenses of making  mistakes. If you want an overview this is the right book, if you want  details call the professionals.	2000-08-20

Now  while I can't see myself purchasing this book and understanding that this  book is tailored to specific audience it was entertaining.<br />Overall you  have crosswords puzzles, word finds, fill in the blanks, picture puzzles  and more to play. The puzzles didn't seem real challenging and I lost  interest within an hour. The book didn't serve any value in educating the  public of the topic of pot.<br />Again for a specific crowd this book is fine,  for everyone else I think they'll pass it up.

Moving on to the IOS and  commands, IP Routing, VLANs, Network Management, Novell and access lists,  WAN Protocols and an appendix that covers the Catalyst 1900 switch.<br />There  are diagrams, router screen shots, labs, hands-on exercises, practice  questions, figures, tables and so much more.

One thing that impresses me about Sybex is the way they put together books. They take a subject, in this case Windows 2000 Professional, and cram more information into 850 pages than any one I know and they make sure  that the information covers the exam objectives completely.<br />In the 15  chapter book you have complete and detailed coverage of the 70-210 exam and  all of the objectives. From the installation and all the ways to make the  install work to upgrading and what to look for and what to stay away from,  and you have only covered two chapters at this point.<br />Moving to the  configuration of the 2000 environment, to managing the desktop and users,  to the administration and management of the groups, user and hardware  profiles and disks, now you have covered up to chapter 9. Impressed by the  amount of information at this point in the book is what made me keep  reading.<br />Chapter 10 gives detailed information about file access and  permissions. Continuing with the network section and printing and dial-up  and remote connectivity. Finally you have optimizing and fine-tuning of the  Windows 2000 workstation making this one of the most complete reference  manuals I have ever come across.<br /><br />As with all Sybex book, there is a  cd-rom included with hundreds of practice questions that will compliment  the questions included in the book. Even more impressive is the fact the  cd-rom has a complete electronic version of the book and the Best selling  \\"Dictionary of Networking\\" included.<br /><br />Sybex is tops in the computer/IT  certification arena, this book is the perfect example. Costing a mere  $49.99, and online you'll find for less, your saving is your opportunity to  excel. Don't pass up this book; your money is well invested.	2000-08-01

I was disappointed with the overall writing of a book. This book is a compilation of pictures and quotes of a rising superstar in the world of Major League  baseball.<br />While the book is filled with dozens of photos and some of the  chapters are interesting, for the most part the book lacks any real story  line. The book does not talk about the career of Derek Jeter nor the  authors examine Jeter in comparison with other great shortstops of the  past.<br />The book would make a great gift to a true New York Yankee fan but  true baseball purists will find this book sorely lacking any real value.  The price is $24.95 and for the money you get very little.<br />Overall you  could and can spend your dollars more wisely on other baseball or sports  books. Sports Publishing has a great website and if you spend a few minutes  there you will find a whole host of sports treasures.	2000-08-01

In order for me to read a fiction book the book has to capture my attention within the first 15 to 30 pages. Death Benefit had me going from the very start and I found myself turning pages and finishing the book  within three hours.<br />Philip Harper is a true talent in the fiction arena  and this work is not short of spectacular. Harper blends a remarkable tale  of murder and corruption with suspense and drama and gives the reader an  opportunity to see how deadly insurance can really be.<br />The main character  of the book is developed as the average man next door, but as the story  unfolds you'll see how devious he really is. Follow along as a string of  what would seem to be natural deaths turn into a complex and intriguing  tale of how greed and power can leads a reporter to uncover the  mystery.<br />Harper's work is some of the best fiction I have read and you  can almost get a sense of reality within the writing. I see this becoming a  blockbuster movie in the near future. Don't pass this one up it is well  worth the time and money.	2000-08-01

Our national pastime is the one constant reminder that everyone kid can grow up to play in the major leagues. I have been a long time Philadelphia Phillies fan and as such seldom read books about other ball clubs. After  finishing this book I will have to rethink that policy as the Detroit  Tigers are one of the most storied franchises in baseball  history.<br />Starting off with the greatest ballplayer to ever put on spikes,  Ty Cobb, the book begins to tell more than a story about the Tigers but  also about the fans in Detroit. Men like Charlie Gehringer, Sparky  Anderson, Hank Greenberg, and Al Kaline, Alan Trammel ands many others are  all in the true baseball fans collector book.<br />The book had Kirk Gibson in  the outfield over the great Harry Heilmann and while I wouldn't have made  that choice the writers do make a fairly convincing argument for the  selection. I enjoyed the inside look into Al Kaline and his often  tumultuous relationship with the people of Detroit.<br />Finally the book is  more that the best Tigers it also includes the near misses, the ones that  should be there as well and even the weird and funny characters of the  teams. Overall a great book for those interested in the game as well as the  \\"true\\" Tiger fan.	2000-06-11

Al Gore wrote a book called \\"Earth in the Balance\\", where he talked about so many environmental issues. In Hard Green you'll find that what Al Gore left out of his book is what you need to know. Taking on the  Environmentalists hard hitting arguments Huber dispels many of the commonly  held \\"truths\\" and shows you that what you have heard and read isn't exactly  the way it works.<br />Huber is a very articulate and highly educated man with  ideas that will take you into the 21st environmental millennium. Huber  empowers the people with ideas that make common sense a reality and take  all the mumble jumbo out of the liberal left and the power brokers in the  environmental movement.<br />Huber is convincing with his ideas about how our  resources such as fuel, food, minerals and water are not running out but  how they will last for a very long time. Huber presents a detailed look at  how people are resourceful in finding alternatives for replacement of what  they need.<br />One of the most misunderstood ideas that the liberals' are  constantly using is that the world is running out of natural resources,  Huber on the other hand delves deep into this issue and shows that earth,  like man, evolves and replenishes what it needs to sustain life and  growth.<br /><br />Tackling other issues like global warming, pollution, saving  national forests Huber completely blows holes in the liberal arguments.  Also Huber tackles the issue of recycling and conserving and again makes  the convincing argument, that what the left tells you isn't the complete  story. Huber's book is the definitive conservative answer and for those  truly concerned about the environment, this is the one book you really need  to read.	2000-05-22

Cashdan's ability to create a convincing argument lends creditability to the book. Cashdan may just have hit upon the secret and unlocked it for everyone.<br />Using the seven deadly sins to illustrate his points, Cashdan takes you on a magical journey down the fairy tale path to show that even the simplest good story has a message for each of us. Cashdan holds nothing back and gives the reader a complete look and in most cases also an understanding that what you read isn't always what you read.<br />With chapter on deceit, using the Pinocchio and Greed, lust and envy with several different fairy tales the once used bedtime stories take on a whole new meaning.  Also Cashdan's trip down the yellow brick road will have looking at OZ in a completely different light.<br /><br />Cashdan doesn't leave you hanging trying to figure out what to do after you have read the book, in fact he includes and appendix on using the fairy tales and choosing the fairy tales to read and explain to children.

I have read and reviewed over ten books on the CCNA exam 640-407. New Riders Next Training Guide for the CCNA exam is the latest in the series.

The books does cover each objective and also includes  step-by-step exercises to help you learn as you study. There are an  abundance of hands-on exercises, but you have to have the equipment in  order to perform most of them.<br />The book gives you case studies along with  review and exam questions. The questions are excellent and they too cover  each exam objective. What the book may need in the next edition is more  detailed information on some sections.<br />Covering exam areas like the OSI  model, TCP/IP Model, IOS fundamentals and commands. Protocols, routing and  an excellent breakdown in detail of the TCP/IP protocol and subnetting.  There was a great number of pictures, diagrams, tables and figures also  included.<br /><br />New Riders also enhances this book with the Top Score  Software simulation on cd-rom. The software has several modes of learning  and can assess you progress along the way. The 640-407 is retiring in July  and this book needs to updated to the next exam. I think that a free  upgrade should be included, but overall a decent value for the money.	2000-05-22

Over the past 40 years civil rights has come a long way and progress has been made in areas that makes life easier. But imagine if you had to struggle with poor education, terrible living conditions, and even  segregation. Now imagine trying to get ahead in a world and society that  was making all this an impossible task.<br />June Jordan takes you on a twelve  year journey through the eyes of one person who life was given these  circumstances and somehow managed to succeed and become one of the most  successful people, her own. June Jordan tells a story through words and  poems that has you stopping and thinking throughout the entire 260  pages.<br />The book is one of the first I have read that makes a clear  representation of how a child caught up in turmoil can block out what they  see and find something good in the life they have been given. Jordan's  ability to capture the reader makes this book one of the most impressive I  have read so far this year.<br />After reading this book and seeing how the  tough and often overbearing father along with the serine and religious  mother were at odds, I gained a deeper understating of how difficult it  must have been for any African American to try to make and succeed in the  white man's world.<br /><br />Jordan has written several other books and has won  a number of prestigious awards over the years. I found this book enjoyable  and easy to read. Take time out and follow through the 12 years with a  child who I found dealt with the same things I did as a child, only Jordan  had them magnified. An excellent book!	2000-05-22

Lizzie Borden took an axe and gave her mother 40 whacks, when she found what she done, she gave her father 41 - or did she? What if Lizzie Borden wasn't the killer, then who did it? William Masterton thinks is was someone  else and his books may just have the answers.<br />Fall River Massachusetts is  the location of one of America's most brutal murders. In 1892 Lizzie Borden  was acquitted of the crime, but over 100 years later people still consider  her the killer. Masterton pieces together, through forensics, a highly  convincing argument to the contrary of public opinion.<br />The books looks at  the evidence gathered, breaks it down and details why Lizzie Borden could  not and was not the killer. I was a skeptic of the book until I started to  openly evaluate what the author was relaying throughout the entire  book.<br />Masterton had to have worked overtime to answer the most difficult  questions. His work is impeccable and his research is by far the best if  have ever seen on this subject. This book Masterton has changed my thinking  on the case - you might want to read this one too.	2000-05-22

Inthe mean time I started reading about the CCDA exam and decide tocheck out this book to find out if it was possible to pass the exam. As I suspected, Cisco Press has put together a book, written by Cisco Engineers that will no doubt be used in my quest for the CCDA certification.<br />The 650-page plethora of incredible information is written by a CCIE and the information is better than any other book I have seen so far. The detail, not only in the text but also in the examples makes this book the perfect study guide for the exam.<br />Exam objectives such as Goals, Topologies, Network Designs, and Wan Designs are but a few of the chapters in the book. The case studies are thought provoking and some of them pushed me to the limits. I found the end of chapter questions to be both useful and hard again challenging my technical abilities.<br />The book is loaded with pictures, diagrams, tables, figures and actual screen shots of examples. The CCDA exam has been taken apart objective by objective. You will need to have some router equipment available in order to understand some of the more complex design issues.<br /><br />As with most Cisco books there is a cd-rom packed with practice questions and tests to help gauge your progress before you go live.

In 1927 Charles Lindbergh flew the first solo trans-Atlantic flight from New York to Paris, this is recorded in the history books. In 1932 his 20-month-old son was abducted and killed, also recorded in the history  books.<br />The subsequent investigations lead to the arrest, conviction and  death of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, again recorded in history. But what if  history was wrong and what if Hauptmann was setup? That is what the authors  try to prove in this book.<br />The book gives new evidence and sheds new  light on a crime many consider to be the worst in history. The authors show  that Lindbergh cremated the body before any autopsy was ever done. They  show, with convincing arguments that Lindbergh's story doesn't add  up.<br />The authors take apart, piece by piece, every shred of evidence and  show that the wrong man was convicted and that the investigators were  detailed as they lead the public to believe. This first rate work gives the  reader a clear picture and after reading you can decide if they have done  their homework.	2000-04-07

In baseball there are some memorable moments, Carlton Fisk hitting the game winning home run in the 1975 World Series for example. In baseball there are also some darker moments, The Black Sox Scandal is probably the  most notable of these.<br />In the book Growing Up with Shoeless Joe, author  Joe Thompson takes you inside baseball's past and gives you a first rate  look at the Greatest Natural Hitter baseball has ever seen. Thompson's book  is the first I have ever read that is more than the typical slander on Joe  Jackson.<br />Thompson takes a look into the man, more than the ball player,  and allows you to see a side of Jackson never before revealed. What  Thompson gives the reader is by far the best accounting of a true hero in  the game of baseball.<br />This book is so much more than a story about a  World Series in 1919; it's so much more than a story about baseball. This  book is about the man Joe Jackson and the side of him most of us have never  seen. I am extremely proud to be allowed to review this book	2000-03-30

If you don't like reading books  there's a cd with the electronic book included.<br />While no book can account  for every situation, failure or error, Microsoft Help Desk certainly makes  a valiant attempt to give you as much information as possible.

When you think about American History the one era that seems to have the most romantic and most appeal is the \\"roaring 20's\\". When we think about the 20's we think of things like Prohibition and bootleg liquor. Rise of  the American Gangster was a big part of the culture.<br />What if that was  only a small part, what if people like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington  were the essence of the American cultural transition in what has become  known as the age of jazz. According to Crunden these men and others made a  more significant impact on society than they are given credit  for.<br />Throughout the book Crunden shows that modern jazz got it start from  the black musicians of the day. Even more impressive is the compelling  argument that Crunden puts forth. Crunden also gives you a glimpse into the  different angle on the race relations of the day.<br />From beginning to end  the book covers what has to be considered one of the most important  historical periods of our time. Crunden shows the how the rise of the  musician throughout the decade, the cultural changes, the social class  differences and the artists themselves make the 20's an exciting time to be  alive.	2000-03-26

The  tapes cover every objective of the exam and the 4th tape in a review and  questions tape.<br />I think that Coriolis has really got something here and  if they expand this series to the exam prep books they would have another  sure-fire winner.

There is also a chapter on router commands and extra features, another  useful tool in passing the exam.<br />Appendix A is the answers to the  practice questions, Appendix B is practice exercises and C is command  structure and a cd with helpful utilities is also included. The only  drawback to the whole book is there is no page numbers making it difficult  to find things. Overall this book will give you everything you need to pass  and for the money a good purchase.	2000-03-25

You ever disagree on a topic and then later find out that maybe you might not have all the facts? In my case, this is the assassination of JFK. I have read over thirty books on the assassination and most point to a  conspiracy. Along comes John Canal and maybe, just maybe I need to rethink  my position.<br />While I am still leaning to the conspiracy angle, Canal give  a well documented and well-written book that may, may have you think again.  Over the last four decades the answers have been shrouded in a world of  mystery and cover-ups, now some of those clouds are disappearing.<br />Canal  uses extensive evidence from ballistics expert testimonies, newly acquired  evidence and his own simulations to formulate the assassination, his  arguments are clear, well documented and extremely convincing. This reader  was most impressed by the layout of his findings.<br />The other thing I liked  about this book was the way the author used phone records of Oswald and  Ruby to track  the movements of both men. This is the first time I had ever  read any book that detailed this are of the assassination. While I still  believe in multiple shooters, this book does give you another side to  consider - well done!	2000-03-25

What can destroy millions on homes without thinking? What is the one resource we have an abundance of? Water and specifically the ocean, so do we need to  worry? Well according to Colin Woodward there is and should a major  concern.<br />In Ocean's End, Woodward describes how the world is destroying  the ocean and the way this affect everyone's life. While the author  attempts to be convincing he fall short in his delivery. Using the \\"global\\"  mentality, Woodward talks about how we need to come together to solve the  crisis.<br />Woodward elaborates on pollution, over fishing and global warming  as reasons we are headed for disaster. While I agree with the pollution  part, over fishing is a problem I cannot agree with the global warming  scam, there is no evidence to prove this theory in the book.<br />Woodward  also wants you to let government \\"regulate\\" the oceans in a global  ecosystem. Again while I think we need to look into the problem, government  intervention and regulation would only infringe on our rights of freedom.  Woodward is well presented, his arguments are the shortcoming.	2000-03-25

Books	5	3	4	N	N	Excellent reading about a very important ammendment.	The 1st amendment deals with freedom of speech, press, assembly. The 2nd is for the right to bear arms. We all know what the 5th amendment is used for and the 13th ended slavery. Some know that the 15th amendment gave blacks the right to vote. But do you know what the 19th Amendment  did?<br />Most people will tell you that this amendment to the Constitution  was one of the most important, it gave women the right to vote, and  understand this is has only been 80 years since that amendment was passed.  In this day of equal right, this is simply amazing that women have only  been voting since 1920.<br />The book covers the founders of women's rights  movement, like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, to Susan B.  Anthony tireless efforts to get the Congress of the United States to pass  legislation to give women the right to vote.<br />You'll read about the  suffragetts to marches on Washington to how the 19th amendment effects our  lives even to the present day.

Sam's a leaping again and this time he's a knight in shining armor! Wait a minute Sam can only leap during his lifetime, right? True and this leap has Sam right in the middle of a medieval festival and there's a catch - the  evil leaper returns.<br />Sam has to somehow reconcile with the person he  believes has stolen his novel and at the same time fall in love with the  woman who is going to publish the book. And of that's not bad enough Alia,  the evil leaper is back to cause chaos and try to kill Sam in the  process.<br />The book is a little slow at the beginning, but after a few  pages the action picks right up and I was captured till the end, which was  just over three hours later. I have enjoyed another exciting leap book,  Mirror's Edge being the first, as much as I enjoyed the series on TV.<br />The  storyline keeps moving from beginning to end, both at Sam's level and at  Al's. While this book probably wouldn't make a good movie, it does make  great reading. The true Quantum Leap fan will certainly enjoy it and at a  price that sure to make them smile.	2000-03-19

Band on the Run was made famous by Paul McCartney and Wings, one of the members of the band was Paul's wife Linda. This book is a deep look into her life and what she gave not only to Paul, but the Beatles, Wings and  Paul himself.<br />Fields writes a book that almost brings Linda alive and  gave this reader a real sense of the person that the media had only a  glimpse of. Fields delves into Linda's relationship with the Beatles and  you get to decide of she had anything to do with the break up.<br />The book  has some pictures, I think there should have been a few more, spanning  Linda's career and they are all black and white. Again the pictures could  have been in color, but this small drawback will not in anyway detract from  the excellent read of the book.<br />The book follows Linda from singer in  Wings to animal rights activist and everything in between. Throughout the  entire book you are treated to many first time stories from friends and  family. One other thing I really liked was the way the author shows Paul's  emotions without going to far overboard. Overall and excellent read.	2000-03-19

Also the cd has a demo  copy of Visio Professional 5.0 for drawing out network. I also think a  Cisco Configuration should have been included as well.<br />About the only  utility on the cd I Couldn't get working the Etherpeek, a small  inconvienence in the grand scheme of things.

Also if you couple this book with the Prentice Hall's A+  Certification Interactive Workbook you would have a great combination and a  better chance to pass the exam.	2000-03-11

I look out in the vast heavens and often wonder what is the size of the universe. I have pondered the questions of, where did it all begin? Where does it end? Can anything change the course of the universe? Lawrence  Krauss may have the key to unlock these mysteries with this book.<br />Krauss,  who is the Chairman of Physics at Case Western Reserve University, explains  in great detail that the old idea the missing mass of space is nothing more  than the space itself. Krauss has written a highly convincing  book.<br />Krauss shows that is given enough black space, a gravitational pull  will occur and therefore cause the universe to alter its position. While I  am a little more than a novice in this area I found the reading fascinating  and hard to put down.<br />What captured my attention was Krauss's quantum  fluctuations of empty space and how it can create a, as he calls it, a  nonzero energy. Grab a copy of this book and you can read his explanation  of this phenomenon. Overall this book was very good, although tailored to  specific reader genre.	2000-02-13

While Mueller makes a great attempt to cover  all of the A+ bases, the book barely scratches the surface.<br />The 260-page  book makes the claim to be \\"Certification Study System\\", and in this you'll  be disappointed. If the author has coupled this his other book then you  might have the right combination and then have greater success passing the  test.<br />To the positive side of the book, you do get review questions, but  again the book falls short by not including a cd with more questions. The  book also needs more depth in covering various subjects. This is a good  source if you are looking for a quick reference for the A+.	2000-02-13

His 580 plus page books breaks down the peer  networking and simplifies some of the more complex issues associated with  that type of environment.<br />Ford is good with his ability to show, in  numerous pictures, what should happen when you make changes or  configuration updates. Where he falls short is in the areas of review  questions and an add-on cd with utilities.<br />Covering areas like printers,  security, utilities, troubleshooting and others over peer networks like  Windows for Workgroups, Windows 9X, Windows NT is a great start, but Ford  needs to also include Windows 2000 in his next edition.	2000-02-13

Since the inception of the game changes have occurred at almost every level and Peter Bjarkman has put  together once of the most complete books on those changes.<br />In the over  575 pages covering one of America's most loved games, you'll be treated to  more than 500 portraits of those that played this game and transformed it  from the peach basket to the break away basket. Bjarkman's remarkable look  should have this book in the hall of fame in Springfield, MA.<br />While the  book is broken down to cover the major periods of the game, the reading is  often not fluid. I found that book can be read from any chapter without  having to read the previous ones. The book covers just about everyone who  ever played and this was a certain treat.<br />From the Big O, Wilt, Dr. J.,  Bird, Magic, Isaiah Thomas, and of course the best of all Jordan, you'll  have a never ending treat of players right at your finger tips and best of  all the book cost less than the price of tickets to see these men play.

For the price, I expected far  more than a basic overview of each subject.

Masters Press Baseball Crosswords Volume 3 fell short of my expectations. I thought the book would have puzzles about baseball and the players of the past and present with stories mixed in. The book is made for the younger  crowds ages 8 to 15.<br />While the puzzles are of good quality, they lack any  real challenge and often they are there could be more clues. Each puzzle  does talk about a major league team; provide you with basic information  about the team and a listing of leaders over the past ten years.<br />I do  like the idea that each team is given an exclusive puzzle. I also like the  stories, but I fell that the author could have given each team it's own  book. Also there is nothing about past players and for a baseball purest  this is a major disappointment.<br />Price in the right range, this book would  and will make an excellent gift for the young, aspiring ball player in your  family. Overall the book is good, but definite improvements can be made.	2000-02-13

After spending two hours reading the poems I was simply amazed at what the author has accomplished in the few short  pages.<br />Water and Life is filled with forty English poems and 30 poems in  Italian and it makes a wonderful read. The author has drawn deep within his  soul in poems like \\"Love Poem\\" and \\"Evening of Spring\\". With the poem  \\"November 22,1963\\" you have short to the point look at history.<br />Caso has  a unique and delicate style, and approach that almost has sensitivity that  makes reading the poems a real pleasure.  \\"Suicide through murder\\"  satirical look at life and the deeper meaning encapsulated within the  writing is yet another of the author's great works.<br />Caso is the author of  other books and Branden.com is an easy to navigate website.

This book is an  examination into that subject.<br />Supposedly using some magic number scheme,  the Bible is a series of codes and when these codes are revealed you will  be able to find out the mysteries of the great unknown. While the author  attempts to make a convincing argument, the argument is weak and often fact  less.<br />The author makes every attempt to convince you that following this  number code you can see how certain things happened, certain things were  foretold and certain things will happen.

For the first time you can read what  those who were there actually thought and felt - a remarkable job.<br />Over  45 eyewitnesses, from average citizens to police offices and sheriffs to  several Government officials, get to tell their story, this time without  interference or pressure.<br />The book reads quickly and is gripping from the  first page to the last. This text is surely a must read for those  interested in the assassination of those who are heavily involved in  research. This makes a great addition to my library!	2000-01-01

I was amazed to see what was  never told.<br />Proving the old adage \\"It's the media that control the  people's thinking.\\" This book certainly should wake you up to the fact that  what you see isn't really what you get, because you get very little from  the press.<br />I took just over two hours to complete the reading and I am  very excited to read Censored 1999, to find out what I missed for the year.  Overall this book will make a great gift for just about everyone - well  done!	1999-11-18

Harry Shearer has written, not just another book about people who hat Bill Clinton, but a book about why. I was impressed by how the author was able to convey a message of disgust with clear and precise facts.<br />While some  people will find this book offensive and some will hate it outright, this  reader thinks that most people will find this book a real pleasure to read.  Shearer has a great knowledge of politics and how the political world turns  and he displays this in every page of the book.<br />Shearer brings the reader  little known facts about key Washington figures. Shearer allows the reader  to choose whom he likes and whom he doesn't. The book is good. Easy reading  from beginning to end. This book will keep you asking for more.<br />While  Shearer gives the reader a quick insight about racism, the culture war and  the generation gap, he does so with a unique blend of satire and humor. I  think for the price you will make a great choice.	1999-10-06

Andersen portrayal of the Clinton's and their marriage leaves a lot to be desired. While Andersen does cover the scandals and portray Bill as a weak, womanizing man, he  fails to reveal anything new. The Book is certainly for those who want more  of the tabloid trash. This book lives in baseless innuendos and hopeful  partial truths. The writer' style is good, but his ability to capture the  reader will leave you regretting your purchase. The book has some  interesting areas, Hillary's affair with Vince Foster, Clinton undisclosed  medical records, but these are far and few between any real reporting.  Andersen tries desperately to get the reader to look at the Clinton's as a  normal family and he fails miserably. I think you would do better to save  your money and wait for the movie. While Andersen may want the reader to  think this cover new and undisclosed material, you find it shows you  nothing new at all. The emperor's clothes are really off with book.	1999-10-06

Bill Bonanno details the answer to that question and much more in the book Bound By Honor. Bonanno's accounts of what goes on t in the mafia are a first  hand look into a world that has been kept secret for a very long  time.<br />Bonanno is able to give the reader a true taste of life in the  Underworld, but it lacks any real substance. Bonanno has an insight into  this life style and ruler of a powerful crime family, but he only touches  the surface. Bonanno was very distance in his approached to relating the  facts.<br />I was surprised at several of the stories Bonanno relates in this  book, however I was left a little unsure of the message. While Bonanno may  want the reader to think that he has blown the lid off of the mafia, the  reader will find that some of the \\"facts\\" cannot be corroborated.<br />An  interesting read for almost any taste, and you should be able to walk away  with the feeling that your money was well spent. I believe that if the  author spent more time detailing some of the facts, the book would have  been a true bestseller.	1999-10-06

Gary Cornwell has done just that with his excellent work Real Answers.<br />As a former  prosecutor for the Department of Justice, Cornwell knows how to obtain and  present facts. This book is the perfect example of, what I would consider,  his best work. Cornwell has an exceptional ability to make the reader want  to know more.<br />Unable to put this book down, I was completely drawn into  1963 and the streets of Dallas. Cornwell presented information in a clear,  concise and well-researched manner. Cornwell is able to sift through the  assumption and present the Real Answers.<br />For anyone interested in the JFK  assassination, or for those researching the case, here is a definite  addition to your collection. I have read over twenty books on the subject  and for the first time, Real Answers makes real sense. A job well done.	1999-10-06

This book lists the 200 men and women, in alphabetical order, who have made a difference during the  last 100 years.<br />Cady blends detail with a personal touch in each  biographical synopsis. The photos, in black and white, give the reader a  face to put to the story. Photographer Jean-Jacques Naudet is a master of  capturing the essence of the person on film.<br />While the price of the book  is a bit hefty, your money is well spent in this collectable piece of work.  For the past hundred years you have read stories about JFK, Ali, Mother  Theresa, Michael Jordan now you can own a part of history.<br />I was most  impressed by the author's ability to remain unbiased in the reporting.  While I may not have include some of the people, I was no doubt impressed  by the list. I am certain that this book will be real family or school  crowd pleaser well into the next century.	1999-10-06
