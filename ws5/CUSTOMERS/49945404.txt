Three separate stories involving the same characters sets the stage for this new novel by the author of 'The Hours.' <br /> <br />\\"In the Machine\\" tells the tale of a young boy coming to terms with the death of his brother by taking a job working on the same machine that killed him, one that is haunted with the brother's spirit. <br /> <br />\\"The Children's Crusade\\" is a noirish thriller that has a group of terrorists setting off bombs at random, or so it seems. <br /> <br />\\"Like Beauty\\" is the last part of the novel and the hardest to describe as it's a futuristic tale of New York.  Set 150 years in the future this story contains the characters from the previous two stories only this time they are not just humans...they are lizards. <br /> <br />'Specimen Days' is a very hard novel to categorize; while I didn't dislike it, I wasn't crazy about it either.  The first two stories are the strongest with \\"In the Machine\\" being the best.  Michael Cunningham is a great writer and he has proven this with 'Flesh and Blood' and 'The Hours', and even though his writing is still first rate, fans of his previous novels will disappointed with his choice of storytelling for this new novel. <br /> <br />Expect to see everyone reading this, but then quickly telling their friends to pass on it. <br /> <br />Nick Gonnella  <br /> <br />	2005-06-14

Two Moons and Katz begin uncovering everything they can about the victim, only to find an endless trail of suspects.  Katz realizes to catch the killer  he will have to draw upon his past experience in the NYPD for this killer has perfected his crimes. <br /> <br />Double Homicide is an enjoyable novel if a little uneven.  The Boston section, which is written by Faye Kellerman, is superior half of the book.  Boston starts off fast and stays that way throughout.  Faye Kellerman  keeps the mystery strong while also developing her main character until the story reaches its surprising conclusion.  Sante Fe, the section written by Jonathan Kellerman, is good, but a little too wordy and the mystery angle is somewhat weak.  The pacing is brisk, but gets slowed down by some developments in the story.  Jonathan Kellerman has written better and fans will notice this, however, fans of Faye Kellerman will applaud her return to top form. <br /> <br />Nick Gonnella <br /> <br />    <br />	2004-10-12

I did not put this down until I finished it. This is pure non-stop entertainment and should be judged as just that.  Yes, the plot gets a little silly, but it's highly enjoyable.  Yes, the two women manage to stay ahead of the killers at every turn, but they are so likable you can overlook how unrealistic it is.  Yes, the two women thwart the attacks on their life throughout the whole story, but it keeps the pages turning.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it's filled with action, murder and several surprises.  I can describe this novel only one way...international intrigue filled Gucci and Prada.     <br /> <br />Sidney Sheldon has been one of my favorite authors for years and his long awaited new novel is the proof as to why; the man writes books that simply can't-be-put-down.  `Are You Afraid Of The Dark' is a thrilling read filled with twists and surprises. <br /> <br />A must read blockbuster! <br /> <br />Nick Gonnella    <br />	2004-09-16

Most of this novel doesn't make sense and the introduction of various plots involving Kay, Lucy and long-time friend Benton only adds to the confusion. I didn't like this novel at all.

Jack, a veteran of the Air Force, promises undying love and a lifetime of happiness to Valerie, the woman who stole his heart. <br /> <br />Against her father's wishes, Valerie marries Jack and starts a family, but within a few years all that was good turns bad... <br /> <br />Jack begins drinking and in drunken rages he takes out his frustrations on his wife.  Before long, Jack begins using his entire family as a punching bag until a devastating act tears his family apart. <br /> <br />With most of the Marsh family forced to move out because of their hatred for their father, Valerie is left alone with Jack, but only after threatening to leave him.  Jack, afraid of being alone, swears to change, and seemingly does until he begins several extramarital affairs.  Valerie, still denying there is anything wrong with her marriage, is faced with another challenge...raising her grandson.    <br /> <br />After many years of abuse, both physical and emotional, Valerie finds herself a broken woman fighting for her life when a night of violence leaves someone dead. <br /> <br /> <br />`Behind Closed Doors' is a powerful tale of a marriage plagued by violence.  However, the story did trace too much of the Marsh family's life and much of the novel was not needed.

Everything has been going great for Sayre, until she receives the news that her younger brother Danny has committed suicide. <br /> <br />Sayre returns to Destiny for the funeral and meets her family's newest partner in crime, Beck Merchant, a shady lawyer who's hiding something.  Sayre takes an immediate disliking to Beck, but she is forced to have close contact with him when the new sheriff determines Danny's death a murder. <br /> <br />As Sayre races to find her brother's killer she finds herself at war with striking laborers and her manipulative father, as well as fighting feelings for Beck, a man with an agenda of his own. <br /> <br />'White Hot' is a good read, but not one of Sandra Brown's best.  The murder story line is interesting, but it takes awhile to get going and once it does get moving it slows down towards the end.  There is way too much going on in this novel and the overall story suffers because of it; Sayre investigates her brother's murder, Sayre digs into her family's past to find they have been hiding dirty secrets, her father's company is in trouble, long-held hostilities are reaching the boiling point and pretty much everyone in the town of Destiny is hiding something.  `White Hot' does have an action packed ending and it does tie everything together nicely, but by that time it's too late. <br /> <br />Sandra Brown is a very good writer and while her newest remains very readable it's not her best.  `White Hot' will provide entertainment for some readers, but fans of Brown's earlier novels will be disappointed. <br /> <br />Nick Gonnella <br />	2004-08-24

Today began like any other day, until the shooting started.   <br /> <br />Medical examiner Sara Linton, tagging along  with her lover, police chief Jefferey Tolliver, is at the police station when two young men with masks and guns barge in and start shooting...leaving one officer dead and Jefferey wounded. <br /> <br />As the tense hostage situation builds, Sara begins to unravel the mystery of the two men who hold them captive only to discover their plan is one of revenge based on the sins of the past. <br /> <br />`Indelible' was a good read.  I enjoyed the present day plot of the hostage situation, but the alternating chapters of the earlier years plot got in the way of pacing.  The two separate plot lines did come together to tie everything up, but I am not a fan of books that alternate plot lines and time periods between chapters and this novel did it throughout.  On the plus side there are some genuinely surprising twists and several tense action scenes.  Karin Slaughter is a good writer and her dark, gruesome thrillers are some of the more enjoyable to come out over the years, but her newest in not on par with her previous books. <br /> <br />Nick Gonnella  <br />	2004-08-04

Lily Mansfield is a hired assassin working on special assignments for the CIA and after nineteen years of service she is the best at what she does.  But, after an assignment goes wrong and her friends are killed, Lily is a broken woman.  Now, after carefully planning her revenge, Lily embarks on a dangerous mission to bring down those responsible for killing her friends. <br /> <br />After Lily accomplishes the first part of her mission she uncovers a plot to unleash a deadly virus and with this discovery comes a violent chain reaction that will have her running for her life.  Enter Lucas Swain, a CIA agent himself, his job is simple; bring in Lily or bring her down, but it's easier said than done because he's falling in love with her. <br /> <br />Lily and Lucas have to work quickly if they are to stay ahead of the CIA and bring down the murderous family responsible the virus. <br /> <br />'Kiss Me While I Sleep' is an entertaining page-turner.  The plot is twist filled and interesting.  Lily and Lucas make a great pair, however the romance that comes into play near the end of the novel gets in the way of the action.  Several chapters are dedicated to the blossoming of the romance, as well as some explicit love scenes.  Putting this small flaw aside, this novel is a great way to spend a few hours.  Linda Howard has crafted another great thriller that will surely land on the bestseller lists. <br /> <br />Nick Gonnella <br />	2004-07-30

As the killings progress Dexter realizes the killer isn?t just copying his style of killing, he?s taunting him to &quot;come out and play.&quot; <br />  <br /> ?Darkly Dreaming Dexter? is the most original and gripping thriller to come out in years. While Dexter himself is a monster, the reader can?t help but to cheer him on and hope he comes out on top. The plot moves along at a brisk pace, but it?s Dexter?s narrative that keeps the pages turning. This off beat novel had me in it?s spell from first page to last and I didn?t put it down until I finished it in one sitting. Readers looking for a fresh, witty and shocking novel should look no further. <br />  <br /> A definite MUST read! <br />  <br /> Nick Gonnella <br />  <br />	2004-07-23

Joey Perrone has hit a patch of bad luck...her husband Chaz, a marine scientist involved in an illegal dumping scheme with an agribusiness tycoon, decides to kill her.<br />While on a cruise, Chaz throws his wife overboard leaving her as shark food.  But, as fate would have it Joey is rescued by an ex-cop and nursed back to health.  Joey comes up with a plan...she's going to play games with Chaz until he destroys himself. <br />As Joey continues to taunt her husband, his cohorts in pollution get uneasy with his erratic behavior and plan to put a stop to it, and Mick Stranahan, the ex-cop who found Joey, realizes after six failed marriages he is falling in love all over again.<br />I loved this book! `Skinny Dip' is vintage Carl Hiaasen; smart, fast-paced, suspenseful and funny as hell.  From page one I was taken on an entertaining ride of politics, murder and the exploration of the human heart.  Filled with the usual cast of quirky characters, razor-sharp dialog and zany situations I couldn't put `Skinny Dip' down.<br />A must read!<br />Nick Gonnella	2004-07-16

Bike messenger Jace Damon has one last pick-up for the night, unfortunately it may be the last pick-up of his life.<br />Jace has to deliver a package for Lenny Lowell, a sleazy defense attorney in the middle of a high-profile murder case involving a Hollywood star.  But, en route to delivering the package, he is almost run down by a car, chased through alleyways and shot at.  Jace realizes there is something worth killing for in this package so he decides to return to Lenny's office only to find the office ransacked and Lenny dead.<br />Now on the run, Jace must fight for his life as the police believe he's a suspect and a killer wants him dead.<br />`Kill the Messenger' is an exciting read, while different from previous novels by Tami Hoag; the novel is suspenseful and the ending packs a nice surprise, but the usual dark tone is missing.  This novel is a lighter thriller that entertains from first page to last, but might disappoint long-time fans.  However, `Kill the Messenger' is a much better novel than Ms. Hoag's last novel and based on the strength of her name alone the book should fly up the bestseller lists. <br />An entertaining summer read.<br />Nick Gonnella	2004-07-16

As with any James Patterson novel the writing is first-rate and the pace is super-fast.  The intertwining of two separate love stories will keep readers turning the pages until they reach the surprising and sad ending.  This powerful novel, that is similar to the novels of Nicholas Sparks, should be a huge beach book.<br />Major thriller writer James Patterson has written a love story...not once, but twice (Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas) and he does it with style to spare.

Imagine a novel written by Jackie Collins and Robert Ludlum and that's what you get with this funny thriller.

Someone does not want Mary to find out the truth and they will do whatever it takes to stop her...even murder.<br />`Killer Smile' is an enjoyable read but not one that is not on par with Lisa Scottoline's other novels.  I found the plot somewhat dull and the secondary characters un-interesting.

Jane's story is both suspenseful and captivating combining the thrills of a murder mystery with the touching story of two estranged sisters putting the differences aside and coming together in a time of need.   There are separate story lines that work nicely throughout the novel, however, when they do come together at the end it's with a surprise twist that is shocking, but may be too convenient for some readers.  <br />Erica Spindler writes enjoyable thrillers in the tradition of Linda Howard and Tami Hoag and `See Jane Die' is one of her best.  `See Jane Die' should increase Spindler's legion of fans and be a big beach book.<br />Nick Gonnella	2004-06-02

Over the years the Prey series has lost it's spunk and that's due mainly in part to the changing of plot style.  The early novels in the series were page-turning thrillers about twisted killers, but the new ones are slow paced mysteries that have replaced the page-turning thrills and twisted killers with boring Russian conspiracies and female assassins among others. <br />Die-hard fans of the series may find this new book acceptable, but fans of exciting thrillers, or exciting Prey novels such as `Mind Prey', `Rules of Prey', `Eyes of Prey' or `Winter Prey' to name a few of the better titles in the series, will be disappointed. <br />Nick Gonnella	2004-05-23

The plot of this history and suspense mash-up is original, and there are some truly exciting moments, however, I did find certain parts hard to follow and boring. The writing style is smooth and easy to read, but the history included becomes tiresome and requires some work to follow.  Character development is handled expertly and the coming-of-age aspect is a nice touch, but as a whole the novel loses track of what it wants to be.  Many novels are following in the footsteps of `The Davinci Code' by combining history, mystery and suspense in a literary thriller that will keep readers engrossed, and while `The Rule of Four' does succeed on some levels it fails on others.<br />Ian Caldwell and Dustin Thomason have crafted a novel that, while not for everyone, will appeal to those interested in the latest history/thriller trend and will most likely land on the bestseller lists making them stars.<br />Not a bad novel, but not a great one either.<br />Nick Gonnella	2004-05-23

Upon arriving Jean gets a bad feeling about the reunion, especially since a fellow classmate died days before under suspicious circumstances, but she goes through with the party only to have her bad feeling become a reality.<br />As the party gets under way Jean receives a mysterious fax exposing a secret that she has kept all her adult life.  Who could have found out the secret and what do they want? These are the question that plague Jean, but in the middle of this turmoil comes another shock...Laura Wilcox, a fellow classmate and good friend to Jean disappears.  <br />Jean is introduced to Sam Deegan, a detective obsessed with the unsolved murder of a young woman,  who may also hold the key to Laura's disappearance, and with his help she can find her friend and put a stop to the threatening letters she is receiving.  Before long, another body turns up and Jean and Sam find out this is the work of a twisted individual known as the Owl.  <br />The Owl is on a mission of vengeance against the Stonecraft women who mocked and humiliated him and he won't stop until his last victim has been claimed, that last victim being Jean.<br />`Nighttime Is My Time' missed the mark on being an exciting read.  This novel should have been better than it was, but the introduction of too many characters and over-abundance of scenes that had nothing to do with the story made it boring.  Nothing in this book worked for me, the plot twists were unexciting and even the reveal of the killer's identity came with no real surprise, by the time I finished the book I didn't care what happened.<br />Mary Higgins Clark has written many excellent suspense novels, unfortunately this is not one of them.  Suspense has always been a key element in a Clark novel, but this time it was left out for uninteresting character development.  In all her years writing best-selling suspense novels, Clark, has only written a few books I didn't like, this being one of them, alongside `Moonlight Becomes Her' which I feel was her worst.<br />Better luck next time.<br />Nick Gonnella	2004-04-09

His love life is nothing to talk about, until he meets a new coworker.  Julia is spontaneous and fun, and after a few dates Tom is hooked.  Unfortunately, the harder Tom falls for Julia, the faster she runs in the opposite direction until a tragedy strikes and everyone must look at themselves and how they are living their lives.<br />`Love Monkey' should have been a cool male novel about love and life in Manhattan, unfortunately it's a slow novels filled with too many pop culture references and too much sarcasm in the form of the main characters thoughts.  The book is written in the first person and quickly becomes tiresome as every thought going through Tom's mind is explained and examined thoroughly with witty comments thrown in for comic relief.<br />I had a hard time getting through this book; the writing style is choppy, the characters uninteresting and the plot never really goes anywhere, but I did stick with it in hopes of it getting better and it did, somewhat.  The novel did pull  together toward the end, but by then it was a little too late.  <br />Kyle Smith does show promise of being an exciting author, especially since he is among the few writing this type of fiction for men.

The large cast of characters is fleshed-out, and the various story-lines do tie together, but things get a little hard to follow and somewhat boring half-way through the book.  At the hands of Richard North Patterson the reader is treated to expert storytelling in an easy to read style and over the years he has written some excellent legal novels, unfortunately this is not one of them.  While this novel isn't terrible, it isn't as good as some earlier titles either; such as `Silent Witness', `Final Judgment', `Eyes Of A Child' etc.  The pacing is a little slow, the length is a little long, and the political intrigue isn't very exciting...resulting in a mediocre novel.<br />Richard North Patterson is a very good writer, but one that writes better in the legal genre rather than the political.<br />Nick Gonnella	2003-10-23

Maura Isles receives a welcome introduction in this novel, and returning character Jane Rizzoli gets to have a personal story-line developed, giving readers a chance to get to know her better.  Tess Gerritsen is one of my must-read authors, and as usual she doesn't disappoint.

LAPD officer Cindy Decker is on routine patrol when she finds an abandoned baby in a dumpster.<br />Cindy must track down the baby's mother, but the trail leads her down the dark streets of Hollywood, a place filled violent gang members, and predators lurking the night for new victims.<br />Joining forces with her father, Detective Peter Decker, Cindy makes a twisted journey for truth, one that will put her life in danger.<br />`Street Dreams' is the weakest entry in the Decker series.  The mystery elements of the novel are barely present, and the Jewish themes are so strong they overpower the rest of the novel.  Faye Kellerman is slowly bringing this series to a halt, and that's a shame because it was one of the more interesting several years ago.  I was not a fan of the first few Decker novels, but as time went on they developed into interesting plot boilers that not only thrilled with suspense, but also with new developments of it's lead character and his family.  Unfortunately, the last few years have seen the plots becoming weaker, and the Jewish story-lines becoming stronger, resulting in a novel a lot less satisfying. <br />If Faye Kellerman can take out the overload of religion, and put the suspense back in her novels the series will get back on track giving readers the Decker mysteries they are used to, but if each new novel remains the same the series will soon drop off.<br />Nick Gonnella	2003-08-25

Ethan is an assigned bodyguard to a huge actor.  The actor is receiving disturbing packages from a fan.  Each package becomes more intense, until the final package hints to an attack from the madman sending them.<br />Throw into the mix a LARGE cast of characters, all with their own plot lines, and you have a heavy epic of good and evil...one that makes absolutely no sense.<br />I could not finish `The Face', I was 200 pages into the book when the mess that was unfolding became so tedious to read I gave up.  I found myself flipping back to previous chapters to try to follow what was going on, and just as I thought the novel was staying on track with a main plot line it veered off into different directions making things crazy.<br />I have been a Dean Koontz fan for years, but have to say that over the last few years his novels have become weaker and weaker.  The Koontz of years ago was a powerhouse author whose novels were suspenseful page-turners, but lately he is painting too broad a canvas with his stories, and the result is a novel less suspenseful, confusing and boring.

A memoir that reads like fiction (much like a John Irving novel), `Running With Scissors' tells the twisted coming of age story of Augusten Burroughs., a teenage boy struggling to survive in the strange surrounding he calls home.<br />Forcing his abusive father out, Augusten is left to live with his mother, a beatnik poet on the verge of a breakdown.  Seeking psychiatric help, Augusten's mother begins seeing Dr. Finch, an unorthodox psychiatrist who bears a resemblance to Santa Claus.  Dr. Finch has problems of his own...he has an extremely bizarre family, as well as a pedophile who resides in his backyard shed.<br />Thinking things could not get any worse, Augusten gets the shock of his life when he finds out his mother is signing over his guardianship to Dr. Finch.<br />Augusten Burroughs lived a wild, and strange life, one that could be the script of a John Waters film.  He has experienced tragedy, horror, repulsion, and ultimately redemption in his, often hilarious, journey of  self discovery and adulthood.<br />`Running With Scissors' is unlike any other memoir you have ever read, or will read, and while it's NOT for everyone,  those that are brave enough to read it will surely never forget it.<br />Nick Gonnella	2003-05-28

Prescott proves himself capable of following these rules until a surprise attack on Cavanaugh and his men leaves many dead, and Prescott missing.<br />As the only survivor of the attack, Cavanaugh wants revenge for the murder of his team, but when he finds evidence linking Prescott to a twisted plan of his own, he sets out on a personal mission to stop him only to find that things are not as they seem, and in the shadows is a powerful player with a hidden agenda.<br />Teaming with his wife Jamie, Cavanaugh begins a carefully orchestrated plan, one that uses the latest technology, as well as intense covert tactics, to stay one step ahead of the mastermind behind this, and  bring him down before anyone else dies.<br />`The Protector' is an adrenaline rush of an action novel.  Starting off fast, and barreling ahead at warp speed the novel can't be put down as each turn of the page introduces a new twist in the plot with shocking results.  Combining believable characters with razor sharp suspense `The Protector' succeeds at being an extremely enjoyable novel, one that raises the standards in the genre.<br />David Morrell is the master of the action/suspense genre, and he is at the top of his game with `The Protector.'  My words can't describe how good an author Morrell is, you have to read him to understand what I'm talking about, and you should because he has been setting standards in the field for years.<br />`The Protector' hooks you from the first page and keeps you spellbound for 400 more, it is one of the best novels out right now.<br />Nick Gonnella	2003-05-22

Reacher knows the guy should be dead because he worked on the case himself, but the guy is alive, and Reacher has some questions for the guy.<br />The FBI also want the guy for questioning, and Reacher is the guy who going to do it for them.<br />As Reacher begins his mission, one official for the FBI, and one personal, he finds answers that will lead to new questions, and before long his mission of revenge will be a battle for his survival.<br />`Persuader' suffers from the `too much going on syndrome'.   What could have been an action packed page-turner is a confusing, slow moving thriller that doesn't get any pep until about half-way through.  I am very surprised this novel is a let down because the Reacher novels have all been excellent page-turners.<br />Lee Child is one of the best writers of expertly plotted, action packed thrillers, but this time out I think the  intricate, and confusing plot threw it off balance, the result is a less satisfying, slower-paced read.<br />Fans of the series will be disappointed with this entry.<br />Nick Gonnella	2003-05-20

While Davenport's character remains strong and  interesting, and the creepy back-woods setting sustains an eerie presence, the plot becomes confusing veering off into many different directions, and the large cast of characters becomes too tedious to keep track of.  <br />John Sandford continues his Prey series with original plots, and smooth writing style, but there hasn't been a tension-filled plot since `Mind Prey'.<br />Fans of this series will surely rush out to read this, and there's no doubt it will be a bestseller, but it's one of the weaker entries.<br />Nick Gonnella	2003-05-20

Attorney Victor Carl has defended guilty people before, but none of them a friend.<br />Vic gets the phone call from Guy Forrest, a former law school classmate and friend.  A frantic Guy tells that his girlfriend Hailey Prouix has been murdered.  Upon arrival, Vic finds Guy naked saying over and over that he's \\"sorry\\", and that he didn't do it.  There was no forced entry, and the only two in the house were Guy and Hailey, so if Guy didn't do it, who did?<br />Vic knows this case stinks, and he knows his friend is covering something up, but Hailey had a dark past.  A past with many secrets, and many men, including Vic himself.<br />As Vic searches for the truth he finds a long list of suspects...a list of people that would have stopped at nothing to see both Guy and Hailey suffer.<br />`Fatal Flaw' starts off fast, but then starts to lose steam.  The story dives back and forth from present day to the past, explaining the story of Hailey and her involvement with different men, and to what relation it has to the killer on the loose.  In addition to the main murder plot there are various sub-plots thrown in to keep the story interesting, but instead it becomes a bit boring and confusing.  There is a nice twist at the end, but by the time you reach it it's too late.<br />William Lashner is a good writer, but he has written better novels (Hostile Witness.)  `Fatal Flaw' does contain the elements of an exciting read; sex, lies, murder, and twists galore, but it just doesn't work, it seems many of the surprises were thrown in at the last minute, and the plot twists are somewhat predictable.  As a whole the novel is readable, but the thrills are not so thrilling.<br />Nick Gonnella	2003-05-12

Hugh De Luc is an adventurous man so it does not come as a surprise to his wife when he goes off to fight in the First Crusade.<br />Hugh, discouraged from his experience in the Crusade, returns home to find villages torched, dozens of towns people slaughtered, his home ransacked and his wife missing all by knights in search of a precious relic.<br />Refusing to believe his wife is dead, Hugh sets out to find her and the only way to do that is to infiltrate the castle where he believes her to be by pretending to be a jester.<br />How do I describe `The Jester'...well, let's start by saying it's unlike anything James Patterson has written before; it's a historical action/adventure.  I will list the good parts first; the pacing of `The Jester' is fast, the action scenes are exciting and filled with brutal violence, and as always in a Patterson novel the chapters are short and punchy.  Now, the bad things; the short and punchy chapters get in the way of the story developing in certain parts, the fast pace makes the story feel rushed at times, there is romance that gets in the way and parts of the book are laughable when meant to be serious.  All this mixed together makes for an unsatisfyting read, one that is very disappointing considering James Patterson's previous novels.  Readers of this type of fiction might enjoy 'The Jester' for Mr. Patterson's easy to read style of writing, but fans of his previous novels should think long and hard before picking up this one.<br />Nick Gonnella	2003-03-04

At twenty years-old with no family to speak of and a criminal and drug history, Tequila lives his life day to day, looking for a score and willing to do anything to get it, so it comes as no surprise when he is accused of killing another street kid by the name of Pumpkin.<br />Clay gets the case and as far as he can see it's open and shut, until he starts investigating and finds shocking evidence that is linked to a huge pharmaceutical company.  Clay knows this case could make him an overnight sensation, a king of torts, if he is to win, but everything is not as it seems and Clay may be the pawn in a game larger than he ever imagined.<br />`The King Of Torts' starts off solid, but then starts falling apart as the plot veers off into different directions.  The first hundred pages are very entertaining as the story of Tequila is being developed, but then the plot takes a turn and goes from a legal drama to a financial drama with some thrills thrown in for good measure.  As always the writing is first rate, but the changing of plot lines is a big distraction and the financial aspects of the book are not very interesting.  `The King Of Torts' does have a good ending but by that time it's too late <br />John Grisham has been one of my favorite authors, but over the years he has been branching out with his novels and they are just not as good as his earlier work.  Mr. Grisham should go back to the formula he is famous for, the formula that was found his best novels...'The Firm', `A Time To Kill', `Runaway Jury', `The Street Lawyer' and `The Client'.<br />A guaranteed best-seller, `The King Of Torts' will fly up the best-seller lists, but be warned \\"it's not one of the better Grisham novels\\". <br />Nick Gonnella	2003-02-13

The creepy plot unfolds on page one, and only gets creepier and more suspenseful with every turn of the page.  The killer is twisted and clever, and one of the more original villans in recent novels.  The only problem is that the killer's identity is known early on, and while it doesn't ruin the rest of the novel, it would have made a nice additional shock if revealed at the explosive climax.<br />Jonathan Nasaw is making a name for himself in the thriller genre writing scary, twisted, fast-paced thrillers, and with this follow-up to his best-selling novel `The Girls He Adored' he proves he is going to be around  a long time.<br />A great read for thriller fans!<br />Nick Gonnella	2003-01-27

What started off interesting quickly becomes dull as the lead character tells his over long tale.   <br />Anne Rice continues her vampire/witch tales with much of the same from her previous novels, only this time it lacks the bite readers have come to expect.  Where the other novels were packed with secrets, sex, gothic descriptions, and carefully executed vampire scenes, this one replaces all that with too much historical detail, and an overwhelming amount of character development on un-important characters.  <br />Fans of the Vampire Chronicles will be somewhat disappointed with this slow paced novel.<br />Nick Gonnella	2002-11-13

From page one the reader is held captive in a race against the clock thriller that stuns with every turn of the page.  It's fast-pace, gripping plot and creepy underworld setting will keep even the most jaded thriller readers on the edge of their seat.<br />Michael Connelly is the leading writer of crime fiction, as far as I'm concerned, and his on-going `Harry Bosch' series is about as good as they get.  But, when an author strays from writing their successful series, we as reviewers (and fans) become leery if the novel will be any good, well that is not the case with Mr. Connelly...three of his best novels are NOT part of the Bosch series, `The Poet', `Blood Work', and now his newest novel `Chasing The Dime'.

Well written, carefully plotted, shocking plot twists and razor sharp suspense sets this novel apart from others in the genre.

But her peaceful existence is about to get shaken up when twelve year-old Molly Seabright comes to her for help.<br />Molly's step-sister was working as a horse groomer among Palm Beach's wealthiest when suddenly she disappears, a victim of kidnapping.<br />Elena does not want to get involved but a few questions for her curiosity plunges her deep into a nightmare where a killer will stop at nothing to get what they want.<br />Now, forced to face the painful memories of her past, Elena must follow the trail of the killer if she is to bring a young woman back alive.<br />`Dark Horse' is a departure for best-selling author Tami Hoag, while it remains a thriller, it is not like her usual gritty thriller, but more a thriller in the Archy McNally vein.  I was disappointed with this book, most of the novel was boring, and even the shocking, surprise ending couldn't pull it back from a time waster of 400 pages.<br />Tami Hoag writes excellent suspense novels, `Dark Horse' not being one of them.  Where Ms. Hoag usually writes dark police procedurals, she has opted to try something lighter, and the result is a slower, glitzy type thriller...one that does not succeed in thrilling as her previous novels have.<br />Nick Gonnella	2002-09-02

We last saw Warren Hoyt behind bars for a series of sadistic killings...  killings that almost pushed Jane over the edge, but now a new series of killings has sent the city of Boston into a state of panic.  <br />Wealthy business men are made to see their wives tortured and killed before they themselves are killed.  Jane knows this is the work of Warren \\"The Surgeon\\" Hoyt, but how could it be? He's locked away!<br />The further Jane dives into the current crimes she realizes these are new crimes committed by a copy-cat killer.  A killer dubbed \\"The Dominator\\".  It becomes clear this new killer has had contact with Hoyt, and before anyone knows what's going on Hoyt escapes...leaving the city paralyzed with fear as two madmen are running loose.<br />`The Apprentice' is a good thriller.  Fast-paced, sharp detail, and expertly plotted, the only fault is the technical detailing sprawling throughout the novel.  Page one lays the ground work for a lightning fast read but as the plot opens up Tess Gerritsen substitutes shocking thrills for very detailed medical descriptions.  Halfway through the novel it seems that Ms. Gerritsen didn't know where to go with the novel, and even though the shocking ending does surprise, it does not answer many questions raised throughout the rest of the book.<br />Tess Gerritsen has been one of my MUST READ authors since the publication of `Harvest', and she has been consistent with good novels ever since, with the exception of  `Gravity'.  Gerritsen's last novel `The Surgeon' was an electrifying thriller, and while `The Apprentice' is a good read it doesn't hold up to be a solid sequel.<br />I am sure readers will rush out to buy this novel, and it will spend some time on the bestseller's, but devoted fans will be disappointed as this is not Tess Gerritsen's best work.<br />Nick Gonnella	2002-08-26

Tough Miami lawyer Jack Swyteck is used to trouble, but nothing could prepare him for what he is about to face.<br />Jack's ex-girlfriend Jessie has come to him for help, she is being sued for $1.5 million.  Jessie was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease and given up to five years to live.  Jessie came up with the idea of cashing in her life insurance policy.  An investment company will front the money and when Jessie finally passes the company will collect on the whole policy, but there is one problem...Jessie was mis-diagnosed and now the company wants their money back.  Jack takes on Jessie's case, ultimately winning in court, only to find out he was part of a scam.<br />After winning the case Jack meets with Jessie to find out the dirty details of her scam.  Several days later Jessie turns up dead in Jack's bathtub-a victim of suicide-or was it?

Now Jack must fight to save his name, his marriage, and find who is behind the powerful company pretending to be a legitimate investment group.<br />`Beyond Suspicion' starts off fast, begins running out of gas half-way through, and then picks up speed again in the last hundred pages.  The once interesting story becomes a bit complicated with the introduction the Russian mob, as well as the nightmares of Jack's wife reliving a horrific incident inflicted upon her many years prior.  What started as a fun novel gets weighed down with intricate plot twists and shadowy characters, but the book does pull itself together with an exciting and surprising climax, but for some readers it may be too late.<br />James Grippando is one of my favorite authors of fast-paced, exciting thrillers, and while his new novel does maintaina level of excitement, the introduction of various sub-plots slows it down a bit, resulting in a thriller not on par with his previous novels. <br />Nick Gonnella	2002-08-20

The police have their suspect, Dick's wife Angel.  Angel was found past out in the front seat of his car parked on the bridge where his body was found, and next to her is a bag of cocaine, to make matters worse her fingerprints are found on the murder weapon.<br />Mike and Rosie could not make it as husband and wife, but they make a great team of defense lawyers, and when the call comes in about Big Dick's murder they know they will have their work cut out for them, especially since Angel is Rosie's niece.  Rosie, battling her own personal issues, must find the strength to help her niece, and at the same time look out for her brother Tony who is in the middle of a graft proposal.<br />As the murder case heats up, and Tony gets deeper involved with wrong doings, Mike's relationship with a woman judge is put to the test, a fellow lawyer's son is arrested on drug charges, and Rosie hides a secret that will shock them all.<br />`Criminal Intent' is an ABSOLUTE MUST READ PAGE-TURNER.  This novel starts off with a bang and plummets ahead at warp speed.  The murder plot unfolds with the unveiling of secrets, and the discovery of each character with something to hide.  The various sub-plots are introduced and then woven into the main plot with such precision that the reader can do nothing but hold on tight and enjoy the ride.  <br />Sheldon Siegel has written two previous EXCELLENT novels, and he is continuing the streak with his best novel yet.

Sheldon Siegel is the author to read if you want an entertaining legal thriller.<br />While this new novel contains fewer courtroom scenes than the previous two Mike Daley novels it still remains a MUST read novel that should rocket up the bestseller lists, and keep readers anxious for the next book in the series.<br />Nick Gonnella	2002-08-12

A brutal homicide three thousand miles away rocks the Decker household, and has Peter and Rina on a plane headed for New York City.  Peter receives the phone call from his half brother whose brother in-law has been found naked in a motel room in Manhattan, and even worse is the fact the man was with his fifteen year-old niece who has since disappeared.<br />Decker knows this case will get worse before it's over, but still he gets on a plane and heads for New York to help the frantic family of the missing girl.  As Decker begins looking into the crime he finds layer upon layer of lies and as he peels away each layer he finds he will have to question all that he believes in, and the closer he gets to uncovering the evil responsible he finds he is at risk of losing the things he holds dear...including Rina.<br />`Stone Kiss' is a bad mystery.  Actually, it's not much of a mystery at all but more a study of Judaism.  The ground-work for the mystery is set by the murder, but the deeper the plot goes the less the suspense and mystery are there.  There is way too much Jewish back-ground in this novel, too many Jewish references, and Judaism plays too heavy a part in the plot.  Fans of the Decker/Lazarus mysteries will be hard pressed to finish this novel because it gets confusing, boring, and just plain messy.<br />Faye Kellerman has had a string of great mysteries, but lately she has been putting the Jewish faith at the forefront of her novels, and it is taking away from the mystery.  Ms.  Kellerman should re-think her plots, and with so many other best-selling mystery writers out there, she should do so quickly before she loses her fans.<br />	2002-07-31

As this case goes from bad to worse, Tempe is asked by the Guatemalan police for help in another case.<br />In this separate case four well-to-do young women have disappeared from Guatemala City.  One of the young women happens to be the daughter of the Canadian Ambassador.  Teamed with Special Crimies Investigator Bartolome Galiano, and Montreal detective Andrew Ryan, Tempe will start her investigation into the disappearances only to find herself in a twisted web of lies and deceit that reach far beyond Guatemala City, and in the shadows powerful figures will track every move, stopping at nothing to silence Tempe and her crew. <br />As the stakes rise in both cases, Tempe must make life altering choices.<br />`Grave Secrets' is a fast-paced thriller, but a somewhat confusing one.  The two cases are interesting, but  the introduction of too many characters and complex twists in both plot lines makes the book confusing.  When the climax is finally reached the reader is not as surprised as they are let down by the outcome.<br />Kathy Reichs burst onto the forensic thriller scene with her blockbuster debut novel `Deja Dead', she followed it up with three equally excellent novels; `Death Du Jour', `Deadly Decisions', and `Fatal Voyage'.

White Mike does not smoke, drink, or do drugs, but he makes a living selling drugs. <br />Partying in million dollar houses with sex and drugs, White Mike caters to the wealthy; children of rich parents.  Children raised by hired help while their parents are too busy at work, or vacationing around the world.<br />In a lifestyle that mimics `live fast, die young', White Mike and his friends will come face to face with an end that will destroy them.<br />`Twelve' is a hard book to describe, it's basically just a story of Manhattan teenagers partying, doing drugs, and having sex.  The shocking fact is the kids all come from wealthy parents who give them everything except the one thing they really need...love.  The hype surrounding this book is due to the fact the author, Nick McDonell, is only seventeen.  <br />While McDonell does a nice job for a seventeen year-old, his story has been done many times before, and his writing style is very choppy; jumping from characters and scenes, to the thoughts of his main character White Mike.<br />This is a readable novel based on the author's age, but the story's been told before, most notably by Bret Easton Ellis with his novel `Less Than Zero'.  While there are parts that are interesting, and several characters that you actually feel sorry for, there are other parts that are silly, characters that you really don't care what happens to them, and even with the shocking ending the reader can't help but feel they saw it coming all along. <br />Nick McDonell does show promise of being a new, hip Bret Easton Ellis, but he just needs the right storyline to prove it.<br />Nick Gonnella	2002-07-11

Jack realizes the only way to bring a killer to justice is to beat the rich at their own game, even if it kills him.<br />`The Beach House' is an easy read, although not the best work from James Patterson.  The novel lacks the gritty, dark tone of his previous novels, and while the legal thriller plot keeps the page turning, it does not sustain the suspense of his Alex Cross, or his Murderer's Club books.<br />Fans looking for the usual James Patterson thrills will be disappointed with `The Beach House.'<br />Nick Gonnella	2002-06-14

A John Saul novel is usually very entertaining, and although `Midnight Voices' picks up the pace about half-way through, it drags along with various sub-plots, and the introduction of back-round on too characters.<br />John Saul has written much better this, he still is one of the better writers in the horror field, but next time he should concentrate on the thrills, and suspense, as found in some of his earlier work; `The Homing', `Black Lightning', `Right Hand Of Evil', and `Night Shade'.<br />Nick Gonnella	2002-05-31

The Center's health facilities have catered to a wide range of city people; from feeding the homeless, providing day-care services for working parents, to providing complete gynecological services including abortions, that's why it comes as a great shock when, on a chilly afternoon, a bomb goes off killing hundreds of men, women, and children.  The city is stunned, and the mayor wants answers.  After a few weeks of investigating, the police come up with their first (and only) suspect, young Navy officer Corey Latham.<br />Attorney Dana McAuliffe is a partner in a very prestigious law firm, and was a patient of the Center for many  years so imagine her surprise when her senior partners approach her and ask if she will take on the defense of Corey Latham.  Outraged, Dana wants to turn down the case, but after meeting Corey she has her doubts about his guilt.  It seems the police have rushed to judgment with Corey for one reason only...his wife had an abortion without his knowledge, and after she told him about it he became very angry.  Dana does not believe this information proves her client's guilt so she takes on the case and begins her own investigation.<br />After looking into several (shady) corners of this case, Dana realizes everything is not what it seems, and the further she probes, the further the media exposes every aspect of the case, as well as bringing to light things from Dana's personal life.  With her life spinning out of control, Dana begins a battle with an unknown assailant hell-bent on using her as a pawn in a vast conspiracy that reaches far past the courtroom.<br />`Act Of God' is not only an excellent page-turner, but a novel of a very controversial topic.  The plot takes off on page one, and does not let up for 500 pages more.  Every character in this novel is well-drawn, and the plot twists come fast and furious.  You will not only stay up late to find out the answers to this perfectly plottedmystery, but also to find out what will become of the main characters.  Everything in this novel works, from it's hot topic, to it's heart racing suspense.  <br />Susan Sloan is the author of two previous best-sellers; `Guilt By Association', and `An Isolated Incident' both of which happen to be two of my favorite all-time novels.  This time around Ms. Sloan raises the stakes with a legal thriller that not only thrills, but makes you think.<br />I can't recommend this novel  highly enough, at a whopping 530 pages I finished it in one sitting, and was sad to see it end.  Buy this book, you will not be disappointed.<br />A MUST read!!!<br />Nick Gonnella	2002-04-02

Eve Duncan is an enjoyable character, and most of the novels that feature her have been excellent, but in `Body Of Lies' the plot races along only to stall when the plot changes to reveal some strange twists.<br />Iris Johansen is a good thriller writer, but in her new novel she has tried to come up with a clever, tricky plot that ends up seeming silly, and boring.  Although not a bad book, `Body Of Lies' does not rank with the previous novels by this best-selling author.<br />Nick Gonnella	2002-04-01

Twist after twist you will be held spellbound trying to figure out where the book is going, and just when you think you have it figured out another twist comes in and throws you off track.<br />Patricia MacDonald has crafted a masterpiece of suspense, very similar to the early works of Joy Fielding, she grabs her reader early on and hurtles them through one of the most enjoyable thrillers I have read in years.<br />I can't recommend this book highly enough, anyone looking for a suspenseful thriller should run out and buy this for it is that good, it deserves to be bestseller!<br />An absolute MUST read!<br />...	2002-03-26

Also adding to the slow pacing is the unusually large cast of characters.  This is one of my favorite series, and although is has some elements of previous Rhyme novels, the whole Chinese setting makes it un-interesting.<br />Jeffery Deaver is one of my favorite authors, but unfortunately this novel lacks the page-turning thrills of some of his previous work.<br />Nick Gonnella	2002-03-16

And from within the walls of Atherton University the three friends will be drawn to `The Snow Garden' a place of mystery, a place from which there is no return.<br />`The Snow Garden' is the second novel from Christopher Rice, and while it's not awful it's also not very good.  It's somewhat boring, and it's definitely not as much a thriller as it is the tale of three twenty somethings coming to terms with life.  As the story unfolds it becomes a little suspenseful, but by that time the reader is bored, especially if they were expecting a thriller as I was.<br />Christopher Rice has the potential to be a good story teller, let's face it his mom IS Anne Rice, but he is not sure of what he wants his novels to be, it seems he wants to tell tales of relationships, promiscuous heterosexual relationships and kept-in-the-closet homosexual relationships, but throws in some murder to make the books sell.  The mixture of themes in the novel will disappoint readers eager for a thriller.<br />Nick Gonnella	2002-02-08

Wanting to settle the matter of his estate, Judge Atlee awaits the arrival of his sons, but unfortunately he dies before he sees them, leaving behind a deadly legacy.<br />Ray, being the first to arrive, is shocked by the news of his father's death, but even more shocking is the discovery of a bag containing an obscene amount of money hidden in the house.  Keeping the money a secret from Forrest is the first of Ray's obstacles, for as he begins tracing the origin of the money he finds he is not the only person aware of it...<br />Desperate, and on the run, Ray must find his answers, or he will die trying.<br />`The Summons' is not a good book at all; not only is it boring, but it's confusing, and where the plot could have been suspenseful it's dry.  The story opens quickly, but takes major turns with the introduction of various characters and sub plots.  If the story stayed focused on the main plot it would have been interesting, instead it takes detours and becomes tiresome.<br />John Grisham is a good storyteller, but where he was the king of the legal thriller he is now opting to spread his wings and lead his stories into straight fiction, and it's not working.  After a series of major bestsellers, Grisham is losing steam, and the punch of his earlier novels is lacking in his newer titles. <br />Fans of the novels `The Firm', `The Client', and `The Partner' will highly disappointed with `The Summons'.<br />Nick Gonnella	2002-02-08

Nancy Taylor Rosenberg has been one of my favorite authors in the legal thriller genre, but in her new novel she has lost her edge.  Instead of keeping speed with her main plot, Ms. Rosenberg juggles various sub-plots that are confusing, and tiresome.<br />Fans of Nancy Taylor Rosenberg's previous novels will be disappointed, as will any fan of legal thrillers.<br />Nick Gonnella	2002-01-26

The further Leilani goes into her story she reveals that she had an older brother, also disabled, who went off into the woods with her step-father, hunting alien spaceships, and never returned.<br />As the bond between Micky and Leilani grows stronger, and the tenth birthday approaches, Micky goes to child protective services to take action and get Leilani out of that house, but in the midst the family disappears in the night, leaving Micky with no choice but to travel across country and search for the young girl she has become so close to.<br />`One Door Away From Heaven' is a well-written story, but one that disappoint Dean Koontz's legion of fans.  While the story remains creepy with the sub-plot of the step-father's serial killing, the rest of the novel gets jumbled up with aliens, hallucinations, mother/daughter relationships, child custody, and a cross country road trip.<br />With his new novel, Dean Koontz tries to take suspense in a new direction...but where?<br />I found myself struggling to stay focused on this book, and after about 250 pages (this novel clocks in ata whopping 608 pages) I put it down, I just couldn't finish it.<br />Dean Koontz has not written a truly great suspense novel since `Intensity', and since he, and another heavy hitter in the horror writing genre, find it necessary to churn out these cross genre disasters, I am going to stick to my favorite author of horror, John Saul.<br />A BIG disappointment!<br />Nick Gonnella	2001-12-30

Where the ghost theme could have been a nice touch, it's actually a gimmick in a sappy romantic plot twist.  Fans of Nora Roberts's thrillers will be disappointed, as it appears she is heading back to writing romance novels, and while she remains a good storyteller, she hasn't written a straight ahead THRILLER since `River's End'.  <br />Even though it's not a bad novel, `Midnight Bayou' is not one I would recommend to many people, unless they were looking for a paranormal romance.<br />Nick Gonnella	2001-10-20

Fans of the vampire chronicles will enjoy the richly detailed novel, that is peopled with many characters, lush settings, and written with Ms. Rice's lyrical prose.<br />Anne Rice has written another winner, even though the beginning of the story is a little slow, she more than makes up for it once the stage has been set for Marius's tale.

Much against company policy, Maris receives the prologue to a manuscript entitled ENVY, with no address or name on it, and immediately she is captivated by it. The prologue tells the story of two young men, and a woman out for a night of fun on a boat, only to have it end in tragedy as only one of them returns. Intrigued by this opener, Maris wants to get in touch with the author, but the submission is signed only by the initials P.M.E. Desperately trying to find any info at all about P.M.E, Maris begins a little investigating and eventually she does find the author, Parker Evans, a wheelchair bound recluse intent on keeping his identity, as well as his past, a secret. Venturing off to Georgia, Maris plans to meet with Parker, and work with him, chapter by chapter to complete his potential blockbuster, but this proves to be a difficult task as Parker is a bitter man harboring a dark secret, and his reason for writing the novel ENVY may not be what it appears on the surface. As Parker's story of ENVY unfolds, Maris starts to question the identity of the book's characters, and if in fact it is fiction. Wanting answers, Maris begins probing into a crime committed decades ago, and at the same time, an evil man is following her every move, and when the time is right, he will unleash his plan to destroy everything Maris has worked so hard for, even if it means killing those close to her. As the past and the present collide, what is fact, and what is fiction will blur, and the lives of Maris, and all those she loves will change, as they are faced with the ultimate deception. ENVY is a gripping suspense novel that grabs hold from the start and doesn't let go. The intricate plot unfolds at a fast pace, and Sandra Brown expertly weaves two stories together with twists and turns, and shocks at every bend. Wellwritten, and perfectly executed, this tale of lies and deception will keep readers guessing all the way up to the shocking climax. As any reader of Ms. Brown's novels should know, when buying one of her books they are going to get an un-put-down-able, entertaining read, and ENVY is no exception, even though parts of the book get a bit silly, it will keep you turning the pages long into the night. No author has, as successfully, jumped from romance writing to the thriller arena, as Sandra Brown has, and I don't think anyone will. As with her previous novels, Sandra Brown has penned another blockbuster destined for the number one spot on all the charts! A MUST read! Nick Gonnella	2001-08-28

As Voort meets his friend in a Manhattan bar, he notices his friend is acting strange&#8230;a little nervous, a little scared, and a lot paranoid. As Voort probes his friend with questions, Meechum skirts around giving any answers, only telling his friend he has made a list of names and he would like Voort to investigate the names on the list. Puzzled, but willing to do his friend the favor, Voort agrees. Twenty-four hours later, Meechum is missing! As Voort begins looking into the list of names he is shocked to find that all of the people, except for two, have died in so called \\"accidents\\".

What began with an act of vandalism turned into something far more deadly.<br />Caretaker to her synagogue, Rina Lazarus, is shocked to receive a phone call from the police stating that her place of worship has been desecrated with anti-Semitic graffiti, and horrible Nazi death camp photographs.  Who could do such a thing? As Rinas husband, Peter Decker begins his investigation into this crime he comes up with a suspect, seventeen-year old Ernesto Golding.<br />Ernesto comes from a family of wealth and privilege, but deep in his family tree are secrets of his grandfather, and the ancestry of his family.  Soon, Ernesto is charged with the crime, a deal is cut, and the case is closed.  Decker, still uneasy about the young boy, keeps probing, untilErnesto turns up dead.<br />When Decker gets word that the boy, and his therapist have been brutally murdered, he quickly opens the case back up, believing, now more than ever, that others were involved in the original crime.<br />As Decker starts to unravel the pieces of the murder, he comes across his suspectthe therapists wife, Dee.   Dee has gone missing, and after interviewing several people, all their fingers point to her as the killer.<br />The deeper Decker gets into his investigation, he pulls his wife Rina with him, and what they find out will shock them to the core, for behind this murder lies the secrets of ruthless parents, and the devastating truths of a generation gone by.<br />The Forgotten is not the best entry in the Decker/Lazarus series: the plot is somewhat boring, and gets muddled down with the theme of Jewish ancestry, and religion.  Much of this novel drags on slowly, and when it starts getting good (about half-way through), Ms Kellerman slows it down again by throwing in more family history and religion.<br />I have been a fan of the Decker/Lazarus series for many years and its sad to say that with each new entry (since the novel Justice, which is about the best in the series) Ms. Kellerman is losing some steam, I hope, as many fans will, that Faye Kellerman gives us a better novel the next time around.<br />Nick Gonnella	2001-08-14

The plot, while complex, is well written, and easy to follow, with plot twists at every turn, and enough shocks to keep you turning the pages.<br />T.

Quickly Jeff is drawn into a harrowing battle of trying to get the hostages out alive, but little does everyone know that Dennis, Mars and Kevin picked the wrong house to hide in, because this family has many secrets, secrets some people will kill to keep from being revealed.  <br />As Talley struggles with the haunting memories of his past, and the tension of the hostage situation mounts, he is thrust in the middle of a battle with lethal crime lord Sonny Benza, and Benza will make sure Talley's whole family suffers if he gets too close to finding anything out.<br />With the clock ticking, Talley must find out the connection between Benza and this family, get the hostages out, and make sure his own family is in safety, but unfortunately the only person that can stop this situation is the LEAST stable person of all.<br />I will not go any further into the plot, because Robert Crais has carefully constructed a spellbinding page-turner that harbors many twists, and plenty of shocks.<br />`Hostage' is an explosive thriller that CAN'T-BE-PUT-DOWN.

Freedman does a nice job of throwing in some interesting plot twists, but by the time everything comes together the reader has figured out most of it.<br />Not a bad read, but not on par with The Disappearance, Key Witness, or House Of Smoke.<br />Nick Gonnella	2001-07-30

The story unfolds at a fast-pace, giving the reader the opportunity to finish it in a couple of hours.  The story of Suzanne is heart wrenching, and tragic, and at the same time uplifting, as it incorporates itself into the lives of Matt and Kate.<br />James Patterson is a very good writer, and while many of his thriller fans will be somewhat shocked at this sudden departure, he does manage to do the impossible, switch genres successfully.  Mr. Patterson has written a novel very similar to the works of Nicholas Sparks, and fans of this type of fiction, as well as fans of Patterson will be rushing out to buy this.<br />Nick Gonnella	2001-07-28

A plot that could change the world as we know it, for one man knows that altered strains of DNA cannot only change plant life, but also create the deadliest weapon of mass destruction.<br />`Mutant' had all the makings of a great medical thriller, but then fell flat.  Combining to much technical jargon, and too many plot twists, it becomes tiresome and hard to follow.  It seems many authors are having a hard time coming up with original plots in this genre, and as many of them try (such as this author), it doesn't always work.  Although much of the novel could be plausible, it didn't make for fun reading.<br />This book does come with a money back guarantee from the publisher, so readers could give this title a try, since they don't have anything to lose, but most medical thriller fans will just wait for new novels from Robin Cook and Michael Palmer.<br />Nick Gonnella	2001-07-04

Until one day a letter arrives.  A vulgar letter, one that is startling, but quickly dismissed.  Then another letter arrives, and another, prompting Zoe to go to the authorities.  With not much to go on, the police do what they can to protect Zoe from the madman making the vicious threats, but ultimitely she must rely on herself to escape the madman.<br />Several weeks later another woman begins receiving letters.  This time the woman is Jenny, a former model, now housewife and mother.  Jenny also ignores the first letter as a prank, but as the letters increase, becoming more graphic, and the madman begins entering her house, she realizes it's time for police protection.  Once again the police don't have much to go on, so their investigation never really gets off the ground, leaving Jenny alone to defend herself and her family against the stalker.<br />And several weeks after that, another woman is chosen.  Target number three is Nadia, an entertainer at children's parties.  Nadia is a free spirit, and one who does not take lightly to the letters she receives.

The first two hundred pages sort of drag as they introduce the first two characters and their backrounds, their friends, their families, and their lifestyles, throwing in some surprises along the way.  The last part of the book moves faster, but it still lacks the punch that is needed.<br />While reading the book one understands the build up of the first two hundred pages, but when everything climaxes in the end, it is somewhat disappointing, leaving the feeling of uncertainty towards several plot twists, and the surprise ending seems to come out of nowhere and is a little silly.<br />Nicci French is a very talented writer, she can come up with highly entertaining, interesting and readable thrillers that deserve to be read in one sitting, and even though 'Beneath The Skin' is very readable, it is not as enjoyable as her previous novel.  <br />Not a bad novel for some readers, but seasoned thriller readers will be disappointed, especially those familliar with French's previous - superb - novel ' Killing me Softly'.<br />Nick gonnella	2001-05-30

The book takes MUCH too long to take off.  The first 200 pages of &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; ramble on, leaving the reader to wonder &quot;what is going on&quot;, and while this confusing/surprise tactic may work in some horror novels, it doesn't here...by the time the pieces of the plot fall into place it's too late.  Much of the novel dips back and forth between characters, resulting in much confusion of what is going on-flipping back in the book to find out certain things is necessary.  And although some of the parts containing the aliens are very interesting, it isn't enough to carry 600 pages. <br />Die-hard fans of Stephen King might like this, but any fan of horror will be greatly disappointed.  Mr. King has been taking chances with the plots of his novels, and I will give him credit for that, but what could have been a great horror novel, is just a mediocre alien thriller.<br />&quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is not as bad as some of his novels, but it is NOT nearly as good as his master works, such as &quot;Misery&quot;, &quot;Pet Semetary&quot;, and my personal favorite &quot;Desperation&quot;.<br />Nick Gonnella	2001-03-22

I thought so too, but the book took too long before anything really happened.  The first couple of chapters are interesting; setting up the plot, character development, and several murders, but after those chapters, the novel becomes tiresome, with page after page of technical jargin, and the introduction of too many characters.  This novel clocks in at (around) 500 pages, if it was shortened to about 350, it would have been excellent.<br />Genetic altering is always interesting in a thriller, but it takes the careful hand of an author to construct it to be easy-to-understand, fast-paced, and fun to read, &quot;Dark Inheritance&quot; fails on all counts.  What could have been an entertaining read, becomes tedious, and much too long.  Newcomers to this genre may find it interesting, but fans of this type of fiction will be disappointed.........	2001-03-16

The latest thriller from bestselling MEDICAL THRILLER author, Robin Cook.<br />&quot;Abduction&quot; is a straight to paperback original novel, and easily one of the silliest book's of the year.<br />I am still shocked that this book is written by Robin Cook!

It seems MANY authors are trying to broaden the scope of their writing, unfortunately, they are NOT succeeding.

While living on the verge of poverty with her family, her father an unsuccessful writer, and her mother in poor health, Lou is unaware of the hardships that her family is facing.<br />After a tragedy strikes, Lou, her brother Oz, and her mother are forced to go live with her great grandmother Louisa in Virginia.<br />Once in Virginia, Lou, will face many more struggles on her journey towards adulthood, and along the way she will find out about life, love, and her family past in the land that holds many mysteries, adventures, and was the inspiration of her father's writing (Lou also has a passion for writing).<br />What was David Baldacci thinking when he wrote this novel?<br />I have been a huge fan of David Baldacci since his first book &quot;Absolute Power&quot;, and I am very disappointed (as will MANY readers) in his new novel.  As always though, his writing is top notch, but why write such a dull novel about a twelve year-old girl?<br />The power of Baldacci's name will sell this, but as word gets out, it will drop off the bestseller list's quickly.<br />Please go back to writing thrillers!<br />Nick Gonnella	2000-10-28

During a savage storm, Denise and Kyle are involved in a terrible car accident, leaving Denise unconscious and bleeding.

Once the rescue mission is accomplished the book drags on about Taylor and Denise's struggle with love, and life itself.

His style of writing is very readable, and the length of the novel is short, so many readers will have no problem finishing it in a couple hours, but many readers will come away from it unsatisfied.<br />Nick Gonnella	2000-09-23

Long time readers  of the series will notice each new novel is taking the series in a new  direction; with less time being spent on the thrill a minute plot twists,  and more time being spent on various sub-plots, and character  development.<br />Patricia Cornwell is the leading practicioner of the  forensic crime thriller, but over the years she has lost her knack of  creating &quot;up all night&quot; reads, she is trying to balance too much  in each novel, and at times it takes away from the main theme of the book.   The story line is interesting in this new book, and the characters are all  likable, but we want more page-turning plot twists.<br />If you are a fan of  the series, you will enjoy this book, new readers should start off with one  of her earlier novels, such as &quot;All That Remains&quot;, &quot;Cruel  And Unusual&quot;, &quot;The Body Farm&quot;, etc.<br />Nick Gonnella	2000-08-03

The story line of teenagers killing their infants is a timely  subject and interesting enough, but things get out of hand with a sub-plot  involving Karp's daughter Lucy, as well as the detailing of the Karp's  family life being affected by the cases.  The novel opens up as a good  episode of &quot;Law And Order&quot;, and then goes down hill, too much  time is spent detailing the backround of prosecuting the cases, and it's  affects on Butch and Marlene.<br />Robert Tanenbaum is a good writer, but his  novels are hit or miss.  Readers of fiction involving lawyers will like his  novels, but readers of legal thrillers will find his books too slowly  paced.<br />Nick Gonnella	2000-07-30

The plot featuring the  stalker is the most interesting and an important part to the shocking  climax.<br />Catherine Coulter keeps the reader in suspense by switching the  plot themes, and by revealing many secrets along the way. If the entire  book was focused on the stalker it would have earned 5 stars.<br />A good read  for fans of fast-paced entertainment.<br />Nick Gonnella	2000-07-25

It takes a while to get started, and when it finally gets steam it does not  seem to go anywhere.<br />&quot;The Ice Limit&quot; is readable, but for great  escapist reading pick up the previous novel &quot;Thunderhead&quot;.<br />Nick  Gonnella	2000-07-22

Collins keeps the pace fast, having the novel climax in Las  Vegas.<br />&quot;Lethal Seduction&quot; is another entertaining blockbuster  from Jackie Collins.  She is one of the few authors to juggle a wide range  of characters and have the reader interested in every one of them.  As  always she ties all the plots together, leaving the reader very satisfied.   Anyone looking for a book to sink into for a few hours should pick up  &quot;Lethal Seduction&quot;.<br />A great read.<br />Nick Gonnella	2000-07-22

Father Thomas struggles with what he just heard,  for this man is the &quot;heartbreaker&quot;, a psychopath who has killed,  and is planning to kill again, his next target...father Thomas'  sister.<br />The plot in Julie Garwood's first thriller is interesting enough,  but becomes silly as it goes along.  The priest's best friend happens to be  an FBI agent, and of course there is an instant attraction between the  agent and the sister.<br />Garwood is known for her historical romances, and  with this new novel she ventures into thriller territory.  I can't say the  author is totally successful in the genre, it has too many traces of  romance writing.  The plot is suspenseful, but too much time is wasted on  the attraction of Nick and Laurent, and not enough time is spent on  &quot;heartbreaker&quot; and his crimes.  Despite slow pacing in spots,  Garwood does accomplish a good climax, giving the killer an identity and  reason for his madness.<br />If Garwood removes the romantic themes of her  next suspenser, she will be on her way to joining Tami Hoag and Catherine  Coulter, two authors who have crossed over into thriller territory very  successfully.<br />Nick Gonnella	2000-07-14

As the two uncover the pieces of the puzzle they will come face to  face with Hook Hobie, a disfigured, madman, who will stop at nothing to get  rid of Reacher.<br />Lee Child is an expert at fast pacing and keeping the  reader in suspense.  &quot;Tripwire&quot; is a fast read, but a confusing  read at the same time.  I was a disappointed with this novel, the plot did  not hold my interest, and the theme of Vietnam thrown into the mix was  distracting.

Although this novel is readable, and does contain some good action  sequences it does not thrill like his previous novels.  &quot;Hot  Springs&quot; is MUCH better than his previous novel &quot;Time To  Hunt&quot;, and does bring connection to characters found in previous  books, it just seems like a genre switch for Mr. Hunter, it is not the  thriller his fans have come to expect.<br />Nick Gonnella	2000-07-06

It has too many characters and the plot jumps around TOO  MUCH.  I will give the author credit for trying to create something  original, but in the process created something hard to follow.<br />The  opening of the novel was enough to hold my attention, but after 100 pages I  could not care what happened, and could not keep concentrated on the many  characters, and various sub plots.<br />Despite high critical acclaim, there  are better serial killer novels out there.<br />Nick Gonnella	2000-07-06

As  things go out of control, resulting in more robberies and  &quot;warnings&quot; to Boldt, he refuses to give up, putting his life on  line to solve this case. <br />I will start off by saying...THIS IS AN  EXCELLENT NOVEL.  I am not going further into detail on the plot, all the  fun is finding out the secrets as you go.  &quot;Middle Of Nowhere&quot; is  a fast-paced, well written novel that entertains as it shocks with new plot  twists.  Boldt is one of the most interesting and likable hero's in any  current fiction series.<br />Ridley Pearson has written the novel that lives  up to his reputation of being the &quot;best thriller writer alive&quot;.   After the disappointing &quot;The First Victim&quot;, fans of the Boldt  series get what they expect, a great book.  If you are new to the series,  start with this book and then go back and read the other Boldt novels,  excluding &quot;The First Victim&quot; (not the best entry in the  series).<br />&quot;Middle Of Nowhere&quot; is a great summer read...it's  great read in any season.<br />A MUST read! <br />Nick Gonnella	2000-06-20

Damon soon realizes everyone in &quot;The  Big Easy&quot; has something to hide.<br />Racing to stop anymore killings,  and prove Remy's innocence, Damon will learn the truth of those he thought  he knew, as well as himself.<br />&quot;Mortal Sins&quot; becomes too hard to  follow, and has too many characters to keep track of.  As the story unfolds  it becomes more a gothic drama, with some plot shocks thrown in to call it  a suspense novel.<br />Romance writer Penelope Williamson has written a  suspence novel under the name Penn Williamson, unfortunately changing her  name is not going to make it happen.  The writing and plot are good but the  book suffers from some bad dialogue (usually found in romance novels), and  too much time spent on the backround of every character.<br />New Orleans and  murder are a good combination but it just didn't work here.<br />Nick Gonnella	2000-06-19

Allison is the BAD girl with a heart  of gold.<br />Valerie Holland is a pediatrician who is also in love with  Terry-Terry is also in love with Valerie.<br />At some point in the novel,  honor they wife comes into play, but I did not get far enough into the  novel to find out.<br />The book just seemed to drag on.<br />I don't know what  kind of novel this is supposed to be...The synopsis reads as a Jackie  Collins novel, but it is far from it.<br />It had the ingredients to be a good  book, but just took too long to put them to use.	2000-05-01

The mother being in prison for murder and the daughter being bounced from one foster home to another.<br />Astrid's journey through life is interesting, but some parts could have been eliminated from the novel. <br />I  am not a fan of this STYLE of writng, within each chapter are paragraphs  that span time (weeks,months,etc.), and just when certain parts get  interesting the novel shifts, and it does this throughout most of the book.   It seems as if the author tried to fit too much into the novel.   Sometimes, LESS is MORE.<br />&quot;White Oleander&quot; has been hailed by  critics and readers, as well as being an OPRAH pick.<br />I don't usually read  this type of novel, but with all the praise it has received, I gave it a  chance.  I wanted to like this book more than I did.<br />The book is just an  okay story that will hold your interest, but it is NOT a novel that will  make a huge impact on you.	2000-04-25
