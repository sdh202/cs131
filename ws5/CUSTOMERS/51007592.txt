I liked the book. The idea of someone wanting to marry for love is quaint but I can't fault her either. Just because someone is handsome don't mean you have to sleep with them, there are some really good looking guys that are so wrapped up in themselves they don't have time for anyone else. <br />A lot of people married for convenience not for love. And given the option to marry and get rich or not marry and remain poor, I'd choose married in a minute.  The coming together of the two is what makes the book and a little suspense makes the book interesting.  <br />I don't understand all the complaints about the book, I've read plenty of bad, gosh awful books before and this is not one.	2002-06-08

It's likely that readers who have watched many of Alfred Hitchcock's films can't help but have noticed how frequently he depicts fetishism, sadism, and voyeurism. Because Hitchcock was a reclusive man and a guarded interview subject, almost everyone who writes about him turns to his work for insight into his life. These writers generally conclude that the director himself was possessed by the very pathologies that resound in his movies.<BR>But John Russell Taylor didn't have to go that route. He wrote this biography with the participation and blessings of the man himself. In Hitch, Taylor admits that his subject often projects his fantasies onto the screen. He also provides a good deal of insight into Hitchcock's domineering, obsessively courteous demeanor. But the focus here is on the details of Hitchcock's life, the preparation and production of his movies, and his relationships with the countless cinematic luminaries who worked with him, including Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant, Grace Kelly, and James Stewart. --Raphael Shargel	2001-12-07

London went on to &quot;earn his manhood spurs&quot; through hard drinking at the steamy waterfront bars on the San Francisco Bay. Claiming never to have acquired a taste for the stuff, London stresses the important role of the saloon in cultivating alcoholism in young men. He brings to vivid life the romantic allure of a place full of sailors with names like Whiskey Bob, whose stories of 'round-the-world journeys, barroom brawls, and dangerous sea adventures mingled with the &quot;comaraderie of drink.&quot; At once a highly personal work of intense emotional power and an unsparing social commentary on the evils of drink, this masterpiece of autobiographical literature first stunned a world audience in 1913, and today continues to strike a resounding contemporary note.	2001-11-25

Crow Point was the loveliest of the five points gracing Jacataqua Island off Maine's picturesque coast. But that did not explain why the summer people-who usually packed up and went home-decided to winter over one season. Their reasons were as varied as their personalities. <br />Natives and newcomers exchange pleasantries at the post office, debate at the town meeting, and sparred at cocktail parties. Alliances shift and forge, hostilities grown and recede as autumn slips into a brutal winter. When a fierce southeaster ravages the coast, the community survives it relatively unscathed, and the townspeople momentarily band together in their triumph over disaster. But a cataclysmic second storm shatters their complacence, irreversibly altering each of their lives. <br />Recalling the events surrounding the Great Blizzard of 1978 that battered the Eastern seaboard, Toward The End sets the daily dramas of the townspeople's comfortable, sequestered lives against the headlong invasion of a seemingly benign, suddenly obliterating sea.  Drawing the characters with all her skill as an experienced, sympathetic observer of human nature, Elizabeth Savage has written a powerful novel about love, loss, and survival.	2001-09-01

Celiese, the lovely slave girl, gasped when her betrothed emerged from the shadows. She had been secretly sent in her mistress's place to wed the much-feared Mylan. But instead of the cruel savage she had expected, he was a magnificently handsome warrior. His cool topaz gaze unnerved her. The fire in his touch sent shivers of unfamiliar desire down her spine.

Indeed, London was the last place a lonely widow wanted to be, but she'd been summoned to oversee her sister's debut and vowed to hold her head high and do her duty, coolly avoiding the knowing looks on the all-too-familar faces among the town. The bold behavior of the dangerously handsome Lord Lucan, however, was too much to bear. Diana knew that the only proposal a woman in her position could hope for was an improper one, and she was not about to let a rake such as Lucan turn her head-or change her mind about love.<br />The Earl of Lucan was no romantic, especially when it came to choosing his wife, but even he knew that second chances were rare gifts of fate-and so when he saw the golden-haired Diana again, he swore to win her over this time around.  Six years had passed since she'd caught his eye during her first London season, and she'd blossomed most beautifully from fresh faced girl to desirable woman.  Sadly, she had lost her endearing innocence along the way and now looked at all men-including himself-with a jaundiced eye, Lucan knew he was no saint, but somehow he would convince Diana that she was capable of passion-even if he had to compel her with his kisses!	2001-07-21
