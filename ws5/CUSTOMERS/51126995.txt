This teen novel is a realistic portrayal of the social repercussions, financial and emotional hardships, and weight of responsibility that teen parents must face. If the novel has a flaw, it's the way the couple's parents bail them out so often....far too many teen families don't have this kind of support (or their own parents are unable to provide it). Still, Carey and Hank take responsibility for themselves and their child and the novel drives home the point that teen pregnancy limits the possibilities unless the couple behaves responsibly and especially continues their education. Good reading for preteens and teens.	2005-10-07

From the London stage to the court of King Charles, Amber gets herself revered, loved, admired and loathed all at the same time. Winsor's knowledge of the period is evident and she weaves real characters - especially Charles, his mistresses and Queen Catherine - in with her fictional characters so convincingly that we almost believe Amber is real.

Sarah isn't that different from teens today; can't see very far outside her own social sphere and she's extremely spoiled. Frankly, I disliked her and had to struggle through this book. It was more of a reminder of why I hated rich, popular girls in high school than educational.<br /><br />I hoped to use this for research in my writing and reenacting, but would never base my impression on Sarah.  Mary Chesnut's \\"Diary from Dixie\\" is of far more historical value and makes for MUCH more interesting reading.

He finds some \\"excitement\\" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending.

As a heroine, she's spoiled and brainless and I frankly didn't like her. She has no character traits with which to sympathize and neither does the hero.<br /><br />My main complaint is that there's little passion and still little romance although Rogers describes scenes of rape and sexual torture in loving detail. Although I'm not anti-lesbian, I prefer to see the heroine having sex with the hero rather than her female friends.

NO! NO! NO! Rape is a violent act committed by men who despise women. No man who does that can EVER be a hero, and Holt's attempt to have him reason out his actions and redeem himself are an utter failure. Equally disappointing is having his helpless, violated victim decide he's worthy of her affection, and worse, fit to be a father to the child he conceived through force.<br /><br />This is a sad attempt at entertainment from a wonderful writer, a slap in the face to real victims of rape, a perpetuation of the myth that it's possible for some rape victims to secretly enjoy their brutalization, and that men who rape really aren't so bad.<br /><br />Read \\"The Pride of the Peacock\\" or \\"Mistress of Mellyn\\" instead.	2005-08-21

This book is disturbing on a number of levels, and not for entertainment at all.

Vogt ignores the fact that that Quantrill raid, while cruel, was in retaliation for atrocities committed by Union troops, who had incarcerated innocent women because of their relationship to members of Quantrill's band in a ramshackle warehouse that later collapsed and killed several of them (who were only teenage girls!). This and the stereotypical portrayal of Union soldiers as pure-hearted saviors and all Confederates as evil slaveholders (less than 10 percent of them were)prevents me from giving a better rating to this novel.

Perhaps the best thing about these novels is that there's none of the whining that pervades so much of the later saga, and Han's wisecracking one-liners are priceless.

From the haunting opening with Lily's psychic attraction to a helpless prisoner in cryosleep, Hodge/Holby takes the reader on a riotous ride through the fantastic realms of space.<br /><br />The plot moves at lightspeed, easily introducing new characters and revealing new twists without a stall. Han Solo has nothing on charming, hotshot pilot Reuben, and the evil Circe invoke nightmares.<br /><br />Although marketed as a fantasy romance by Dorchester Publishing, this novel really crosses genres. Fans of \\"Dune\\" and \\"Star Wars\\" will feel right at home in Hodge/Holby's galaxy, and her handling of the parapsychic realms draws favorable comparisons to Marian Zimmer Bradley's world of Darkover.<br /><br />This adventure is not to be missed.

It's difficult to mix deep Christian faith with sensuality but Ms. Gifford pulls it off, and convincingly too. I won't give a synopsis of the plot here, since our talented diva Harriett already did it better than I could.

Her biography is both a tribute to her and to her loving family, especially her mother. I didn't find the story lacking because it didn't discuss her daily life and limitations in depth; I think perhaps she wanted to maintain SOME privacy in a life that of necessity has sacrificed so much of it, and the whole point of her story is that Brooke is not defined by her disability. I think the true tragedy of her accident was not that she was so severely changed, but that we were all so nearly robbed of a remarkable and gifted human being. I wish Brooke and her family well, and hope to see her on the speaking tour. Five stars for an inspiring story.	2005-03-10

Although good things came from the women's movement - domestic violence and anti-stalker laws, better sexual assault laws (the victim used to have to prove herself innocent first), battered women's shelters, rape crisis centers, and opening doors to careers - we've also take a big step back, baby. Although I disagree with some of the writer's allegations such as eating disorders,(anorexia, for instance, was first identified in the 17th century) which often result from emotional or sexual abuse - it is indeed time for a return to some more traditional values. These days, the wages of sin is indeed death, and sex respect needs to be rekindled in younger generations of females. Modesty is indeed a virtue and it's time to rediscover it.	2005-03-02

The Biblical passages offered for suggested reading are of much more practical value, and less of a trial to read through. Read the Bible together and study the many feminine examples of character and faith - Esther, Mary, Elizabeth, Rebekah, Rachel - and skip the lavender phrasing in this.	2005-02-24

Woodson Institute Series)	Books	1	3	40	N	N	Extremely disappointing Civil War work	This long-awaited work proves disappointing to Civil War historians and buffs alike. Robinson contends that the Confederacy lost the war as much through demoralization at home due to the pending demise of slavery rather than the defeat on the battlefield, a supposition which easily collapses under the weight of historical fact. Less than ten percent of the men who fought for the South ever owned a slave, and neither did the vast majority of white southerners. Slavery was not the sole cause of the war and hardly a reason for people who did not own them, and thus were unaffected by either its existence or its demise, to fight in its defense. Taken against the fact that the Confederate government in its last year was willing to free slaves in return for fighting - which would have dismantled slavery, this allegation simply has no basis in reality.<br /><br />Virginia was the first state to ban the African slave trade and in 1859 the Virginia Legislature very narrowly defeated an amendment that would have ended the \\"peculiar institution\\" in that state. When added to the fact that thousands of non-whites (including my grandfather and his Cherokee nation), including free and slave blacks also fought for the Confederacy, Robinson's allegations are unfounded in real history. This book adds nothing to the student's understanding of the war and is based on supposition rather than historical fact.	2005-02-05

His all-too-true allegations about young people being prepared to be students rather than real-life workers is all too true. College and college prep programs prepare one for four years in a classroom, but not necessarily for a true career.

Igraine, Arthur's mother, is married to Gorlois of Cornwall in an arranged marriage and has resigned herself to her typical fate of women of her day when she finds true love with Uther Pendragon. Igraine's sister Viviane, High Priestess of Avalon, is desperate to preserve the Old Faith in a world quickly being overtaken by Christianity. Morgaine, Igraine's daughter by Gorlois, is an innocent pawn rather than a villain in this piece, manipulated by Viviane to conceive Arthur's heir in a desperate attempt to put a king faithful to paganism on Britain's throne and bring Avalon out of the shadow world. Gwynhyfar, sold to Arthur in marriage, is equally determined to make Britian a Christian country.<br /><br />A towering tale of grief, tragedy, triumph, love and hatred, \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is perhaps Ms. Bradley's finest work, even over her celebrated Darkover series. This novel grips the reader's soul and will remain for the ages as a testimonial of the power of legend, and one writer's extraordinary talent. If ever a book deserved more than five stars, it's this one	2005-02-02

Extremely disappointing to someone looking for romance, and that's how this novel was marketed. Gets two stars only for its interesting portrayal of the 19th century fashion industry. The story itself is only worth one	2005-02-02

Ms. Rogers seems to equate placing rape in exotic locations with romance and adventure - not even. Romance readers want spinetingling adventure, not torture.  We want tender,  passionate, sensuous lovemaking, not sexual assault. Read only if you're into bondage and abuse. Quite frankly - Very, very, very, very, bad!	2005-02-01

This novel loses credibility by posing in the romance genre and is a disappointment in the long-running career of this fine author. Romance fans want accuracy in their historicals but we also want happy endings....and having the heroine end up as the Other Woman doesn't count. Sorry, only one star, and if you read it, get used.	2005-01-28

Sheltered Creole belle Aimee finds the life her upbringing prepared her for swept away by the Civil War. Left alone and destitute in Union-occupied New Orleans when her grandfather dies, she's forced to house Union Major Brian Garrard. If this book has a flaw, it's the cover art...in the first editions, Brian, a Union officer is depicted in a Confederate uniform!

As a heroine, she's spoiled and brainless and I frankly didn't like her. She has no character traits with which to sympathize and neither does the hero.<br /><br />My main complaint is that there's little passion and still little romance although Rogers describes scenes of rape and sexual torture in loving detail. Although I'm not anti-lesbian, I prefer to see the heroine having sex with the hero rather than her female friends. This book left me feeling like I needed a bath and the violence is the stuff of nightmares. Avoid, or buy used!	2005-01-28

There is an emphasis on negative Southern acts, such as Longstreet's foraging mission in North Carolina, while northern atrocities are glossed over. An impressive piece of historical bias and revisionist history, and only the maps are of interest. Most of those are available for free from the National Archives, just to name one source, or other better-written works, so don't waste your money.	2005-01-24

A welcome reminder of what Christian faith can and should do in the public arena rather than the lip service most politicians give us, and the extremism of both right and left in the secular arena.

From the atrocities inflicted by Columbus to the journalistically-engineered wars for territory and the shameful interning of the Nisei during World War II, \\"A People's History\\" is still a must-read for any serious history student.

Spend less and save more, he says, and most of us heard this from the cradle. If you know nothing about budgeting, investing, credit control, and responsible spending, this book is for you, but there's really nothing in it that most of us haven't heard before. Might be useful for young people just getting started, but not really for people late in life. We've already heard it and if folks who don't get it by now probably won't just from reading this.

Her lover, however, was Scott Peterson, a suspected murderer.<br /><br />Ms. Frey tells her story openly and frankly and holds nothing back. Shocked to learn that her lover wasn't who he said he was, and horrified to learn that he was suspected in the disappearance of his wife, she immediately contacted the police, cooperated with their investigation, and testified about their relationship. Like any woman in such circumstances, she might have considered hiding until the police came to her, but instead bravely came forward. Laci and Connor might have had to wait even longer to be found and justice in court might not have been served so quickly.<br /><br />Ms. Frey's honesty adds to her compelling story.

Anita is becoming a helpess nympho! Still she does return to her detective work and sinks her teeth in yet another mystery involving preternatural murders and meets a new pard of wereleopards, including Nimir-Raj Micah who is at least more interesting than Richard.

Windrider's Oath lacks the breathless excitement and political intrigue of \\"The War God's Own\\" and \\"Oath of Swords\\" while attempting to introduce new characters that really aren't that interesting. This series doesn't advance the overall adventure or tie up any loose ends. What about Churnazh? What about Jashan? Tell us more about the gods and their war, Mr. Weber. I loved the first two books but can't really recommend this one unless you're just in desperate need of a Bahzall fix (Brandark, the second-most interesting character, gets short shrift in this book).

There's only one \\"mistake\\" which is probably a typo - Comanche puha (power) is repeatedly called puta in the book, unfortunate since puta is obviously the Spanish word for prostitute.

Johnston tries to convince us he's a loving father, but the man is frankly a child abuser and no motivation justifies his treatment of his daughters. She also made some errors with Comanche culture, especially the Numu language. This series is entertaining if you simply want to read a romance, but fans who select historical fiction tend to be quite knowledgeable about their favorite time periods, and WILL catch glitches. I think this talented author could have been a bit more careful with her research and the novel would have been MUCH more entertaining. For that reason, only two stars.	2004-11-26

The writer gives an interesting portrayal of Sioux life and culture, but I found the \\"romance\\" angle to be a bit unconvincing. The harsh - usually cruel - treatment of an captive slave, while realistic, at the same time makes the love affair hard to accept. Black Bear and his people torture Jen's brother, enslave her, and essentially force her to be the concubine of the \\"hero.\\" I couldn't accept that the heroine could so easily fall in love when there doesn't seem to be anything between them except sex, and the first time he forces her. Sorry, \\"rape seduction\\" may have washed in the 1970s, but astute readers can see the holes in the 21st century. Black Bear may secretly suffer from having to treat the woman he loves so cruelly, but since SHE doesn't know that - why does she love him? He doesn't tell her until the end which is far too late. This type of historical romance IS hard to write but since it's fiction some stretch could have been used to make it more believable. I didn't think Black Bear was heroic at all, just a brute. The ending is a bit unsatisfying since Jen's brother and grandmother basically just disappear. Entertaining, but I think this obviously talented writer could have done a little better.	2004-11-25

Anita solves thrilling mysteries while carrying on a sexy love life. Although I hate Richard, the other characters were interesting. The last book left me waiting breathlessly for the epic confrontation with Belle Mere and the Mother of All Vampires.....and instead we get sex, sex, sex and more sex that isn't even interesting sex, just largely lurid and gross. Anita has regressed into a hand-wringing nympho. The murder mystery had great potential that was never explored and seems to be merely something for Anita to do when she's not getting laid! Ms. Hamilton, what were you thinking about???? The book is badly written, badly edited, and a waste of good wood pulp and your money. Let's hope the next one gets it right.	2004-11-17

Shannon, illiterate immigrant daughter of an abusive father, devotes her considerable energies to nursing wounded soldiers and struggles to resist forbidden love with this handsome soldier.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back in Wyoming, Jenny cares for her war-torn, damaged family, including Cole and Grace whose new marriage is disrupted by the appearance of Cole's estranged wife.<br /><br />The Duncan-Lynch clan faces tragedy and triumph set against the backdrop of the American Civil War and the result is sure to please fans of this series and attract new ones.

This book picks up right where \\"Crystal Shard\\" left off, with Drizzt Do'Urden and pals fulfilling their promise to help dwarf Bruenor Battlehammer find his lost homeland, Mithral Hall. But! Regis the Halfling, always in trouble, is in the worst of his life, and an evil assassin is on his trail. Salvatore treats us to a new hateful-but-seductive villain in Artemis Entreri. My only complaint about this book is Salvatore's persistent use of the Irish brogue for his characters, which gets a bit annoying to read, and his seeming attempt to make a PC statement by focusing so heavily on racism. Written at the beginning of the PC 1990s, Salvatore repeatedly refers to the drow as \\"black elves\\" in this book rather than Drow, which he doesn't do in any of the other books in this series. Seemed a bit pandering to me, although Drizzt is definitely a victim of prejudice in the drow-hating Realms. Highly recommend as this is a fabulous adventure series!	2004-11-13

My only complaint about Salvatore's series is that I had to wait a year between books! Salvatore makes up for the lag between \\"Streams of Silver\\" and this book by giving us everything we want. He takes the Companions of the Hall on a breathless chase to free Regis the Halfling from the clutches of evil Artemis Entreri. We visit the eastern-themed world of Calimport, the desert city, and meet the master thieves guild. Drizzt gets his climactic battle with his almost alter ego Entreri, and it's a doozy! Personalities from the Forgotten Realms gaming world are dropped in here and there, such as Alustriel of Silverymoon. If there's a complaint, it's the finger-choppings, which are a bit shamelessly Frodo-ish, but who cares? A wonderful conclusion to this trilogy, with a hint of new and promising adventures to come.	2004-11-13

This book is a major disappointment. The hero and heroine don't get together until the last third of the book. The war is little more than a backdrop \\"Oh, this is going to be a terrible thing\\" over and over. Instead of real romance, we get child molestation, slave concubinage, the obligatory PC horrors of slavery....gag. I wanted history and romance and this book fails to deliver. The author also made a few mistakes with her research and does a poor job of depicting historical figures such as General Lee, Stonewall Jackson and others. She tries to describe the heroine looking sexy in pantalets (which were out of style by the time of the war) and a camisole (which is an undergarment that didn't exist yet - women of the period wore chemises). If you want to read real Civil War romance written by somebody who really knows the period, buy Heather Graham instead.	2004-11-11

Miss Agnes Lee, as the daughter of the famous general, was in a unique position to record the inner workings of one of America's oldest families. She records a touchingly ordinary life of a typical 19th-century young woman; home life, going to school, her hopes and dreams. Truly interesting to historians should be her position as \\"teacher\\" for her grandfather's slaves, who were being prepared for their freedom. General Lee wanted them to be taught to read and write so they could make a living, and Miss Agnes and her beloved sister Annie (who died tragically of typhoid during the war) taught the classes. Agnes, like her sisters, never married although she had a hearbreaking love over with Orton Williams, whom the war turned into a hard-drinking man. She tearfully refused his proposal and never healed from her grief when he was hanged by Union troops. This is an invaluable resource for a young girl's life of the period.

Not true! If one reads diaries and letters of the period, the daily running of the home was left to the women - managing the slaves (if the family owned any). Women handled a good deal more of the marketing and financial running of farms, especially, than is generally believed. Perhaps women weren't involved in politics, but the backbone of southern life was the home and that was the woman's province. Women proved their capability before and during the war by managing the homefront. As for refugees - the tales told by thousands of women who were forced to flee their homes are far in excess of the numbers suggested by the author. The worst atrocity of the war - the hundreds of women captured by the Union in Roswell, Georgia - is ignored. The author also suggests that support for the war by southern women waned as it went on, another questionable fact in light of the many diaries of the period and the tremendous outpouring of grief at the surrender. Most women couldn't bear to record the end of the Confederacy in their diaries and surviving letters are filled with bitterness. Still, this book is an excellent researcher. Also recommend Juanita Leisch's books on \\"Civil War Civilians\\" and \\"Who Wore What\\" although her fashion research should be taken with a grain of salt as it is theory only based on a sampling of period photos.	2004-11-05

Bayleigh and Long Quiet had the potential for a great romance, but they did too many improbable things and their passion was unconvincing. Some of the characters are impossible to like, especially Bay's father Rip. The author attempts to convince the reader that underneath the crust, he's really a loving father, but it doesn't wash. This man sets impossible standards and is, quite frankly, a CHILD ABUSER. I kept hoping somebody would off him in a justifiably gruesome manner. Long Quiet spends YEARS secretly loving Bayleigh and seizes the chance to claim her, even insisting that she share his bed, then inexplicably dumps her. After all these years and miles searching for her, he doesn't even bother to see her safely home - he just abandons her on the road! They finally get together, but in a stereotypical manner - shotgun wedding and he thinks she only wants his money. The last straw for me was naming his son Whipp - a dumb name at the least and horridly insensitive at the worst since his wife is forever scarred from beatings and abuse as an Indian captive! If ever a child's name conjured up negative images....<br /><br />There are also NUMEROUS mistakes with Numunuu (Comanche) culture, ESPECIALLY the language. About the only word Johnston got right was Pia (mother) Others are misspelled or just COMPLETELY wrong - for example, Long Quiet proposes to Bay and asks her to become his Paraiboo, which is the Numu (Comanche) word for chief, not wife! Wife is kwuhu, not even close! Bay's easy abandonment of her foster daughter, which a Comanche mother would never do, is appalling. Comanche medicine men also did not have as much authority as was depicted here. If one is going to write about Native Americans, one should make an effort for accuracy. Anything else is just plain exploitive to the culture and heritage.<br /><br />I wanted to like this series, but found it anything but truly romantic. Sorry, only two stars.<br /><br />I highly recommend Lucia St. Clair Robson's \\"Ride the Wind\\" instead of this book, as it accurately depicts Numu (Comanche) culture and language, and is based on the true story of Cynthia Ann Parker.of this book, as it accurately depicts Numu (Comanche) culture and language, and is based on the true story of Cynthia Ann Parker.	2004-10-26

Both sides of issues should be represented with each side getting an equal voice. We supposedly have a free media in America, but news has a definite slant in one direction or the other. Presenting both sides of an issue is an impossibility even when the networks DO attempt to interview everyone; the network still leaves you in no doubt as to its own opinion.

I liked this alternate history, but Turtledove is obviously not aware that Lee never owned slaves (less than 10 percent of Confederate soldiers did) and didn't believe in slavery. It was one of the causes of the war, but not THE cause, and didn't become an issue till 1863.

Perhaps the Supreme Court (with its majority of candidates from the Reagan/Bush Sr years) should have recused itself and sent the issue to Congress to decide. West Coast polls, which were still open hours after the east has closed, never really gets to count. People hear the election is \\"over\\" and do not even go to vote.

There are definite signs of child abuse, and not all of them are physical. Sadly, the people most likely to see them usually ignore them: so-and-so has been my friend for years, I know she'd never do something like this OR yes, the father/boyfriend might be capable of abuse but I know (the mom) would never tolerate it, OR that could never happen - these people aren't \\"that kind of family.\\" It can happen to anyone, and sadly, it does.	2004-09-10

Adult survivors of abuse have only the twisted guidance of screwed-up parents to guide them through life. Only the worst cases of abuse make the news. Some people don't even realize they were abused until they look back on their childhoods with an adult's wisdom and insight - a child often thinks the dysfunctional situation is normal and doesn't realize that this doesn't happen in all families - nor should it. Knowing what's normal is impossible for us - because we never knew what normal was! Essential for the adult survivor	2004-09-10

The focus on child abuse is on children, and the adults who survived because it was often never detected have been overlooked for far too long. So many adults, like me, didn't realize until we were grown just how screwed up our childhoods were. As a child, you don't realize that this isn't normal, that all parents don't treat their children this way, and that it wasn't right because you think your parents always know what's best. Our pain is minimized or dismissed because \\"it's over now, you're grown up\\" or we're told \\"just don't dwell on it.\\" A must read for adult survivors	2004-09-10

I read this book back in the 1980s, re-read it recently, and felt as if I were rediscovering and old friend. Dr. Forward begins with the discovery of the neutron star on earth, then moves to life on the star itself. We watch the cheela evolve as a species, from ignorant superstition to scientific genius, and wait breathlessly as they and the earthlings encounter each other. Dr. Forward, being a real scientist, lost me a few times with his technical terms, but instead of making me bored or frustrated and left feeling outside, I was just sorry I couldn't speak his language and really appreciate the true depth of the story, which I feel will hold the reader's interest regardless of their level of education. It's a fascinating story of life on another world, how it might evolve, and what might happen when humans find it. A must-read for serious sci-fi fans and amateur astronomers.	2004-09-10

They preach \\"just move on\\" and \\"how relevant is that really, when it happened years ago?\\" \\"don't live in the past\\" \\"determine to put it out of your mind and don't let it control your life\\" and probably the worst of all - \\"Just don't dwell on it.\\"  If it were that easy to heal, people wouldn't need therapists and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder wouldn't exist at all.  Abuse leaves scars that never really heal, damages and sometimes even destroys a person's ability to trust or establish true relationships. PTSD and trauma make it difficult to hold jobs or just get a good night's sleep. Her \\"spokes\\" are entirely accurate. The majority of homeless people, alcoholics, drug abusers, etc are abuse survivors. Christina also explodes the sacred cow of adoption: that all adoptive parents are warm, wonderful people people who take in unwanted children unselfishly and solely out of the goodness of their hearts, and would never dream of abusing them.

So much abuse is undetected until the child grows up and realizes that no, this isn't normal (I didn't realize all families weren't like this) and it WAS wrong. Too many well-meaning people minimize the adult survivor's pain or dismiss it as meaningless: \\"that was years ago and it's over\\" \\"get over it and move on\\" or the worst, \\"Just don't dwell on it anymore.\\" If you haven't been abused, you don't get it and never will. thank you, Mr. Farmer, for not only understanding, but for showing us a way out.

Ms. Graham proves once again that she's a master of Civil War fiction with \\"Dark Stranger.\\" Set against a usually-ignored theater of the war - Missouri - this novel seethes with sexual tension as well as the dark horror of the war. Missouri suffered the ravages of Quantrill's raiders and Lane's butchers, and Graham's heroine is caught in the crossfire. Graham easily achieves the usually-impossible task of creating a sympathetic hero from the nearly-savage and ruthless Cole by painting a vivid picture of the personal suffering so many men and women experienced in this war, and embodies the desperation of the women left to survive alone in heroine Kristin.<br /><br />Ms. Graham's knowledge of the period is flawless and she blends history seamlessly into her story. Refreshing to see Civil War fiction that wasn't either sloppily researched, overpowering in detail, or overly burdened with attempts to be politically correct.<br /><br />Bravo, Ms. Graham.

If this is a taste of things to come, I may give up on this series. If she wants to kill off characters, please get rid of the at first-beloved but increasingly annoying Hagrid.	2004-08-16

Regan van der Rhys is an insensitive jerk and philanderer and so is his son Caleb, who has developed into a major disappointment as a major character in this book.

Jeff Shaara, like his father, has a tremendous gift for both presenting history as it was while giving us a look into what real historical personages might have thought and felt at pivotal moments in American history. His portrait of Benjamin Franklin is particularly engaging. The reader will feel a part of the action 200 years into the past with this fabulous novel of the American Revolution.	2004-08-06

Women are reduced to unintelligent, subservient roles with men who are probably seeking to cure their own ineptitude as husbands - and who may already be abusive. Bright even exhorts the man to \\"be gentle but firm with her\\" when you make the announcement that you are taking a traditional role of husband henceforth, as if your wife is an unruly child.

It's evident that Lossing was a rabid Union sympathizer and not a soldier, and that he only interviewed high-ranking Unionists after the war for his &quot;research.&quot; Among the phony jewels: Lincoln's assassination was a massive plot led by Jefferson Davis; Union prisoners of war were deliberately mistreated while Confederates were well-fed and housed by their captors; Jefferson Davis was gently treated after his arrested and housed in (quote) comfortable quarters during his captivity instead of the rancid, wet cell that Northern and Southern people alike criticized; no atrocities were ever committed by Union generals such as Sherman. Don't even think of using this for your book report!	2004-08-01

The author's care to a truthful portrayal of both sides of the Comanche-White conflict in Texas is evident. The romance between Cynthia Ann/Naduah and Wanderer is of course highly entertaining, but this novel is carefully researched and also gives a fascinating look into Comanche culture and Texas pioneer life.

Cat must keep Ty's family together while he's away with his troops - and with THESE in-laws, that's no easy task! Civil War buffs will delight in Ms. Holby's accurate research - Ty's troops will remind many of Mosby's Rangers. And meanwhile, back in Wyoming, Jenny carries on the Duncan family legacy....

Readers of Ms. Jeffries' previous books will remember the hero of this one, Lord Ravenswood, from &quot;Dance of Seduction.&quot; Like me, they probably viewed him as a stuffy bore....but believe me, he's been holding out on us.

One can enjoy new characters while still meeting beloved old ones from previous books. The only flaw I found was with the love scenes. I think the author was trying to be new and original and instead made a sensuous scene somewhat laughable with her downright weird names for male body parts.....While they're historically accurate, she's still writing for a modern audience, and I burst out laughing several times because it was so absurd. Still, the story more than made up for it. Read the whole series - you will be glad you did.	2003-09-03
