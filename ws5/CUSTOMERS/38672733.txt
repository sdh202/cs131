He has had to fake his own death and leave his family, friends, and previous life behind.  Now he travels with Mr. Crepsley and slowly learns the ways of the vampires.<br /><br />Vampires are not the creatures of legend and seem to have a great respect for life.  They do not kill wantonly.  They do not kill to feed.  But Darren is still disappointed by the path his life has chosen.  Hardest for him is the lack of friends.  When it begins to be a bit too much, the pair travel off to rejoin the Cirque where Darren becomes friends with Evra the snake-boy.  Soon he makes a more human friend.  But life is hard and soon tragedy strikes from an unexpected direction and Darren is again faced with harsh reality.<br /><br />A good continuation of the series.  The writing is pretty much the same in style and tone with the same tricks used for keeping the reader going.  Another fine book.	2005-09-29

Young Darren gets a chance to go to a mysterious show known as Cirque Du Freak.  He sneaks out to see it with a friend expecting a freak show.  What he finds is even more.  The freaks are more than simple deformities but it is a trained spider that captures his deepest attention and desire.  His friend believes that the man who controls the spider is a vampire he read about in an old book.<br /><br />Darren decides that the trained spider must be his and steals it just before the Cirque is scheduled to leave town.  He learns how to control the deadly arachnid and eventually shows it to a friend.  But when the unexpected happens and leads to disaster, Darren must make some very weighty decisions and make sacrifices that will affect the rest of his life.<br /><br />A pretty good story.  I felt the kids were a little too uneducated and naive for their situation.  It almost seemed like it could be taking place in the fifties but there are references that place it in a much more recent year.  The writing style is good and laid out as a memoir.  There are scenes of foreshadowing that keep the reader moving along wanting to find out what is next.  All in all quite enjoyable.	2005-09-29

Her writing style of rhyming verse should be popular with fans of Dr. Seuss.<br /><br />In this book, Hairy McCleary is joined by a slew of other dogs (some have their own books) as they explore down the street.  But a terrible cat gets in the way of their doggy behavior.<br /><br />The book is nicely illustrated with full-page illustrations.  The verse follows patterned rhymes and the list of dogs is repeated each time a new one joins up.  The repetition and simple plot make it good for younger readers and it sets the stage for many other adventures.  All in all it is like of combination of BISCUIT (Alyssa Satin Capucilli) with its repetitiveness and ANGUS AND THE DUCKS (Marjorie Flack) with its resolution of curiosity.	2005-09-21

Thessaly finds herself fighting a Naga.  This is not the first monster she has fought recently.  Then Fetch returns and claims that the monsters were sent by him and that they are a monster-slaying team (even if she didn't know it).  Now there is one last case but the monster doesn't really exist.  Except that it does and it cannot be stopped. <br /> <br />Thessaly knows the coming monster will be her destruction so she sets accounts right and goes on a quest to discover a way to stop the monster.  But everything says the monster can't be stopped.  Can Fetch and Thessaly pull a rabbit out of a hat and stop the unstoppable?  You will have to read it to find out. <br /> <br />A very interesting tale told in an unusual way.  Dome of the action occurs completely off stage with very little description (a technique that worked well in The Books of Magic).  The art is clean and the monster has a Kirby-ish look.  I did not feel the story was either dragged out or condensed.  It seemed to be told at just the right pace.  Quite entertaining.	2005-09-16

The other residents seem to be very strange.  One day Coraline finds a door in the flat that leads nowhere.  At least it usually leads nowhere. <br /> <br />On the other side of the door there is usually a brick wall.  But sometimes it opens into another house where Coraline finds her other mother and other father.  They have buttons for eyes and want her to stay with them.  But when Coraline refuses the real trouble begins and Coraline must rely on her wits and some subtle help to overcome the dangers lurking on the other side of the door. <br /> <br />Some of this book reminded me of the Courtney Crumrin books what with their parents that don't seem to pay attention.  But the similarity is slight in the end.  Most of the book is original is simply plotted.  No detail is mentioned for no reason so readers who pay attention will probably not be surprised by much.  Still it is a fun book intended for younger readers.	2005-09-14

Then the day arrives and we see children and parents as they prepare, go to, and arrive at school.  There is much said about a lack of napping places that does not match my children's experiences.  But then we see how the parents are saddened by leaving their kids behind.  The resourceful teacher manages to find a quick solution and all ends happily. <br /> <br />The first day of school can be hard for children and adults alike.  This is the first book I have come across that deals with the excitement and hesitancies on this special day.  A very fun book for parent and child.	2005-09-14

What makes it so great is its set of rules that everyone follows.  These rules meant to make things look nice, has resulted in higher property values.  But there is a committee that keeps an eye on things to make sure that all is in order. <br /> <br />The Morrises try to follow the rules but soon find that they do not approve of all of them.  They try to get the rules changed.  Then they discover that strange things have happened to others that have tried before.  Then tragedy strikes the community and changes are made to make things safer and more watched.  But the trouble doesn't end and fanatics rally for conformity.  In the end it is a fine story. <br /> <br />One of the characters reminded me of one from THE BABY SQUAD (if you read them both you will know who I mean) but the rest of the book was fairly original.  While I had expected some similarities with the X-Files episode, there really weren't any.  This one takes a completely different tack on things.  A fine suspenseful novel that should be enjoyed by Neiderman fans.	2005-09-14

Not Paul Revere and the Sons of Liberty are rising up to overthrow these new rulers.  This is the start of this first half of a twelve-issue story.  The Authority must try and fight a popular cause that is making them out to be tyrants and oppressors.  Meanwhile the Carrier gets directly involved and enlists the Midnighter to help put things right. <br /> <br />The way the story progresses, the reader has to wonder what is going to happen in the second half.  This is a true Authority tale complete with tragedy, death and destruction.  Add the typical blurred line between good and bad and an old villain and you get a very entertaining and fast-moving story with an uncertain future.  The reader can't be sure if things will work out for the better, the worse, or even slightly better than the worst.  This uncertainty really helps drive the story and keep the reader reading as fast as they can. <br /> <br />The best of the mini-series so far with the Kev stories being at the other end of the spectrum.  If you like the Authority then you will have to read this one because it is packed with all the things that make the series work.  Check it out.	2005-09-14

But babies need a lot of attention and that means the baby is not always available to be met.  But eventually Biscuit gets his chance. <br /> <br />Told in the same style as most of the other Biscuit books, this one has more of the repetition of the original than many of the others.  The art is completely adorable as always and fans of these books will not be disappointed.	2005-09-14

The five extinction events in Earth's history also occurred on two other planets at the very same time.  The aliens already feel that any scientifically minded person must believe in god the creator because science proves the creator must exist.  This comes as a surprise to main character and paleontologist Tom Jericho.  He has always felt that science does not prove god exists and nothing short of a smoking gun will change his mind. <br /> <br />But Tom gets to work with one of the visiting aliens and is exposed to countless scientific proofs that god must exist.  But even though Tom has an incurable disease he still cannot bring himself to believe in a creator.  Toms's work with the alien shows the reader some of the incredibly improbable coincidences necessary for life to exist.  The presence of the aliens also has an effect on political and religious groups and bodies.  Some of these are followed in greater details while others are almost anecdotal. <br /> <br />Sawyer is no stranger to dealing with rally big concepts and he really holds his own in this one.  I have always felt that science leaves plenty of room for god and certainly does not disprove the concept so I was especially pleased by the premise.  I did feel that the book was a little preachy about health care.  I cannot believe that every Canadian's first thought in any health care situation is to compare options with American health care.  But other than that I found the book to be an excellent read.  Check it out.	2005-09-13

Plots are hatched and agents are enlisted.  Soon the Authority is on the defensive without even realizing it.  But what happens when the powers eliminating the Authority decide that they need the Authority? <br /> <br />The book claims that the Authority is being attacked at their human level and not through superpowers.  That may be the intention, but it doesn't rally come across that way.  But even though that premise is not completely clear, the team's perils are.  It definitely looks like the Authority can be completely undermined with little resistance on their part. <br /> <br />Not a bad book, but a little weak in its ability to tell the story in a more meaningful fashion.  Certainly better than the Kev stories but far from the best.	2005-09-13

This book seems to indicate you shouldn't trust the title either. <br /> <br />What we have in this book is a collection of short stories that ran in the Chinese edition of Playboy.  That alone should give you an indication of what you might find.  But unlike the satire and parody found in Little Annie Fannie, Kung-Fu Sex Fighters relies on a much simpler format.  Kung-Fu knights are celibate.  There is evidence aliens have visited the Earth (there is?).  Therefore the knight should have occasionally run into the aliens. <br /> <br />Each story has some form of knight and some form of sex.  Some stories have aliens.  They also have a very dry bit of wit that probably would work better with more cultural references and familiarities.  As a result the reader is left only mildly entertained by stories with little action, sex or humor. <br /> <br />While I understand the author's fight to get his work seen in a more repressive society, theses strips need more work than just the controversial issues.  The action, what little there is, is so badly drawn as to be nonexistent.  Many of the panels have such a hodge-podge of a color scheme that it is often hard to make out what is going on (especially in panels with aliens).  While it is possible that readers with more familiarity with Chinese culture and history might get more out of this book, I am not sure that it would be worth it even then.	2005-09-13

Or at least the identity she wants him to think.  Now John is convinced even more that he has to protect the future of the Nightside.  To do so he decides to go back in time to the original creation of the Nightside so that he might learn something that can be used against his mother. <br /> <br />Traveling back in time is very dangerous and only a few could make it happen.  But as John prepares for his new quest, he has a case thrust upon him  involving a man being hunted by alternate versions of himself.  But even this case ties in to the growing problem of the Nightside's future and John's role in it.  Finally John begins his journey and the reader is taken to some very interesting places where new and old characters are met. <br /> <br />This book does a very good job with time travel and its paradoxes and pitfalls.  John reveals more determination and skills as he tries to protect the ones he cares for and the Nightside in general.  This book should not be read without reading HEX AND THE CITY.  It is good to have read the others but HEX is a definite requirement.  At the time this volume was released, Simon Green had already turned in the eighth and ninth volume in the series so there is plenty more to come.	2005-09-13

This is not a near-future society like in THE BABY SQUAD.  Nor is it a science-fiction medical thriller like DEFICIENCY and DEAD TIME.  No science fiction or fantastic elements in this one.  Just a suspense tale of a killer in a small town. <br /> <br />The small town of Centerville makes a living off of the hunting trade.  But just as the season starts, a hunter is killed.  Soon there are more killings and the town becomes gripped in fear and vengeance.  A reporter comes to town and teams up with the local mechanic to write about hunters and the potential changes in a hunter's mind set.  But the story grows and tension builds until the final chapter as everyone has to deal with the idea that someone may be hunting hunters. <br /> <br />Even though this one is different from the author's recent books, I still found it enjoyable.  I was almost put off on the very first page where it said, \\"There were a few inches of frost on the ground\\" but I later realized that the whole book was in serious need of proofreading.  It read much like an early draft in terms of mistakes.  I was able to immediately figure out all but one (still haven't figured out that one).  But even though I am a stickler for these things, the mistakes did not get in the way of my enjoyment of the book.  Check it out.	2005-08-24

While it has many of the standard elements they are weighted differently in this one. <br /> <br />Five young women met as freshmen in college.  Although all quite different, circumstances of their initial meeting bonded them together.  One thing they all had in common was they did not like injustice and wrong-doing (particularly when aimed at one of themselves).  During college they have a number of wild adventures where they dole out their own brand of justice.  These stories are portrayed as flashbacks throughout the book. <br /> <br />Just after graduation they decide to get together once a year for new adventures.  Each year a different one chooses where they will go and what they will do.  This time Helen, a fan of horror movies, has chosen an abandoned hunting lodge where a slaughter took place many year earlier.  But things quickly turn serious when they realize that the place is not completely abandoned.  But it is when they decide to cut their visit short and leave the first day that things begin to go wrong. Now the ladies must pull together and use their skills in their most serious adventure. <br /> <br />Unlike many other Laymon books, we do not see characters become uncontrolled when the bonds of civilization are broken.  This book really focuses on characters standing up for themselves and taking the law into their own hands.  Also unlike many others, this one offers better explanations as to why the characters make the decisions they do and why the police are not an option.  Definitely chilling in parts with great atmosphere.  Things really do proceed right to the final page.  A must for Laymon fans. <br /> <br />PS.  Look for the author's cameo.	2005-08-19

If the tumor is removed through surgery, he will lose much of his senses.  But with the tumor, another change enters his life in the form of a beautiful doctor.  The two fall in love quickly and she hears of a possible new procedure that may help him. <br /> <br />Having committed himself to trying the experimental procedure of a secretive doctor, he comes out of the operation a changed man.  Unknown to him, the surgeon has been trying to develop enhanced soldiers by splicing animal DNA into volunteer soldiers.  The neurosurgeon is his first non-military test.  Thinking he might lose some of his senses, the neurosurgeon is amazed to find that his senses are better than ever but strange things begin to happen to him. <br /> <br />As the story develops, the main characters have to find out what has been done and how to stop it from happening again.  Although there are some horror elements, this is really a thriller what with its military secrets, Senate investigations, cover ups, spies, and more.  The horror elements are almost toned down and certainly not dwelled upon.  All in all it makes for a very interesting book and a new take on an old idea.	2005-08-15

Recently it took the place of a California youth and entered the world of humans.  It then continued to change its appearance and experienced more of the world including World War Two and many others.  Now it is being drawn to Samoa where research is being done on an ancient object found on the bottom of the ocean.  The object may be related to itself. <br /> <br />Unknown to this changeling and shape shifter, another creature has stalked the planet for eons.  This one is a chameleon and rather enjoys killing and mayhem.  It too has been drawn by the strange object.  Each creature has wondered if there are others like it on the planet.  Soon they will meet and learn the truth.  But the Chameleon has long since decided that others like itself should be eliminated. <br /> <br />The story is told alternating between the book's present which follows the study of the object and the past of the changeling as it works its way through recent history (starting in the Great Depression) until the timelines converge.  We get a little bit from the Chameleon's viewpoint and a synopsis of its involvement in human history.  All together it makes for a very interesting tale and offers insights into human nature through the eyes of something not human.  This is not a monster vs. monster story as the conflict that is foreseen is handled quickly.  A nice tale that manages to be full of wonder while remaining down home.  Check it out.	2005-08-15

With her is her husband Bobby, his friends and his family.  They are going to introduce Thradon to movies and golf.  Just before they arrive, the recovering government has sent out a team to thradonform another planet. <br /> <br />While Ket, Bobby and the other humans are welcomed with open arms, the science team on the other planet has been attacked and occupied by another alien race.  Bobby and Ket turn Thradon upside down by introducing Shakespeare to the theater market while getting the movie industry started.  Everything seems rosy and the changes are good.  Then the fate of the thradonforming expedition is learned and its off to the rescue. <br /> <br />A very nice and fun follow-up to BOBBY'S GIRL.  The action is good without being too heavy.  The drama remains serious without compromising the feel-good nature of the book.  All in all a pretty fun read and a must for those who enjoyed BOBBY'S GIRL.	2005-08-15

He has no idea who his parents are as they abandoned him when he was very young.  But one day two different men come to the school looking for him; a dignified rich man and a bum.  One really is his father.  Jason is the last of a line of dragonslayers and his parents have tried to keep him hidden, but the modern dragons, capable of passing for men, now know of his existence. <br /> <br />Jason's father, Aldric St. George, has come to enlist the aid of his son to wipe out the last of the dragons.  Along the way they meet a woman touched by magic who joins their quest.  But Aldric soon learns there are more dragons than he thought and one of them has plans of destruction on a global scale.  Father and son must rise to the occasion to stop the dragons' plans. <br /> <br />Written with the idea of a screenplay in mind, much of the action has a Hollywood feel to it what with plenty of explosions and fire.  The plot reads like a series of short adventures and nothing seems very hard (including escaping from somewhere no one has ever escaped from).  Like Rowling's books, there are plenty of inconsistencies with details only making sense for a specific scene and then being thrown out the window. <br /> <br />This is the first of a series (a slight excerpt from the next volume appears at the end).  The poor writing/plotting will probably not put off many readers but I like my books to be consistent.  Proper world-building is important in SF&F but seems to be very weak in many new books.  Still, this is a fast read with fun, if not actually tense, action and it should appeal to many readers.	2005-08-15

Literally.  She does not know at first but soon learns he is the prince of a magic kingdom.  Unfortunately she learns this when his fiance finds them together.  But he is sincere.  His kingdom is in trouble and it could be saved by marrying Paige. <br /> <br />Meanwhile Leo learns that there is a possible change in the balance that could put Evil in the lead.  Seems it is related to the fate of the magic kingdom.  The kingdom was originally occupied by \\"pure magical beings\\" but mundanes (mortals) have found their way in.  A past Queen wanted to restore things and created a curse that would kill off all of the mortals if the Prince did not marry a magic being.  Enter Paige. <br /> <br />Palace and city intrigue come together as the Charmed ones learn that the old Queen was not the only one  who wanted to eliminate the mortals.  A large following of Loyalists are in the shadows trying to ensure the curse goes as planned. <br /> <br />This was an interesting story but it had a feel of having been written for other characters and adapted to the Charmed universe.  It could have made a good paranormal romance novel.  The powers of the Charmed ones are not used (except to prove they have them).  Even Leo doesn't use his except after he succeeds by not using them (for instance only orbing after already escaping in other ways).  But still it worked nicely.  My only problem was the ending seemed a little too pat.  What happened to the Loyalists?  Surely they and their hatred are still around.   But despite that it was one of the better Charmed books.	2005-08-15

The Authority determines that the US Government was responsible for the accident.  Because of the government's cavalier actions the Authority moves in and takes over the United States.<br /><br />While the thrust of the story is simple, the plots and sub plots make it a rich and complex story.  Comics fans will notice the Kirby tribute as the Authority must deal with the vengeful aliens while trying to take over a country.  But through it all the characters are all true to their respective books as the whole Wildstorm universe is affected.<br /><br />I had not read Sleeper so I did not get all of the references when I first read this book but I don't think it hurt my first reading.  One should obviously be familiar with The Authority as it really is their story even if a lot of titles are involved.  As this book takes place in the middle of Authority: Fractured Worlds, it is a necessary part of any Authority library.	2005-08-10

I am just unclear as to why these were ever written.  Kev seems to exist mostly to annoy the Authority. <br /> <br />Kev is a BAMF working for the British government.  He is in an unenviable position because a previous case went very badly (a minister was eaten by a tiger).  In the first story Kev is hired to take out the Authority.  Kev manages this almost without trying and then his troubles really begin. <br /> <br />In the second story we find out the history of \\"the thing with the tiger\\" and some of the current repercussions of it.  With most of the Authority Kev must work with Apollo and the Midnighter on a retrieval mission in order to ward of an alien invasion.  Of course with Kev involved things get pretty dicey for a while. <br /> <br />I am a big fan of The Authority and many of its related titles but this one just did not do it for me.  There always seems to be a point to Authority stories but none can be found here.  The distasteful Kev (first seen sitting on the loo) and the bizarre aliens seem to be an attempt and bad twisted humor.  Add some less than stellar artwork and a major plot thread that doesn't make sense and you get a book that many will prefer to forget.	2005-08-10

Like most of the previous volumes there are two long stories (four issues each).  This also contains a nice short story at the end.  When I first read it I was rather perturbed to find out that between the two stories was a mini series that should be read before reading the second story. <br /> <br />The first story has the Authority going up against the leader of a new religion that is spreading around the globe like wildfire. <br /> <br />After a short notice telling us to look for the Coup D'Etat mini series that should come next, we have the post Coup story where apparently Jenny Quantum's mother is suing for rights to Jenny.  Right at the same time massive ruptures into the Bleed occur all over the world. <br /> <br />Finally we have an almost touching tale where Jack Hawksmoor takes on a small murder case that has some personal meaning for him. <br /> <br />For fans of The Authority, these are good stories.  No one should be surprised that violence and anarchy are the dish of the day.  After all, the group was founded by government-hating Jenny Sparks.  If you like the series you should have no complaints with these stories but if you don't, you will.	2005-07-28

Like in the Comic Kingdom Come, the metanormals are not popular due to a reckless accident that cost a lot of lives.  An Executive Order was issued giving the metanormals a chance to leave the county (with an extra $50,000) and then forbid them to stay under penalty of death.  To handle these cases, police departments have special officers called MTacs.  This is the story of one of these officers. <br /> <br />Soledad O'Roark is new to the squad and soon finds herself confronted with a human fire menace.  The only thing that saves her and other members of the squad is a gun she designed and has been trying to get approved.  Suddenly everything hits the fan and she is being investigated for using the non-standard gun.  As Soledad's goals seem to be going down the drain, she also manages to start the glimmering of a relationship, an unusual occurrence for an MTACS. <br /> <br />By the end of the book we have learned the histories and motive of many characters.  Learned the alternate history of the world.  Learned of human/metanormal relations.  It was a very interesting read with plenty of action and plenty of though provocation.  A very intelligent novel and an interesting main character.  I can't wait to read the next Soledad book.	2005-07-27

The Girl-With-The-Purple-Sneakers starts out the day telling Biscuit it is America's birthday. <br /> <br />The rest of the book shows all of the events and activities of the whole day, starting early with setting up decorations all the way to the final fireworks display.  Biscuit gets to see lots of fun including picnic and parades. <br /> <br />In the end we are left with a simple lesson in the meaning of the Fourth of July and traditional ways it is celebrated.  The story is illustrated with the usual high-standard pictures that are always so adorable.  A fun and informative read.	2005-07-27

In the end you can feel that the reader has some idea of what Father's Day is about and what it honors. <br /> <br />The artwork is up to the usual cute standards of the series.  The flaps are standard for the holiday books and reveal some of the surprises of what Biscuit is up to.  A pretty good book.	2005-07-26

The gifts vary greatly as do the recipients (everyone from grandparents to birds).  A simple tale of how fun it is to be nice, helpful, and giving. <br /> <br />The artwork is standard for the Biscuit series and quite a few familiar faces will show up (human and animal).

But this one seemed to have an interesting premise and I gave it a shot.  I am sorry I did.  Our main character (Michael Carmichael) almost dies in a skiing accident when he falls into a waterfall.  At the same time a bus hits a bear and crashes nearby.  As Michael recovers he begins to notice strange things. <br /> <br />Food rots very quickly in his house (and once where he works), animals don't seem to like him and someone has been paying his bills.  The story then muddles around for way too many pages until the plot finally develops (last fifty pages).  It is then that we finally find out where the author is going and where we find out most of the rest of the book is pointless and unrelated.  This could have made a good and solid short story (50-75 pages) but as a novel it comes off as mostly filler. <br /> <br />As you read the book you may notice similarities with the movie Heart and Souls.  Other readers will see many other similarities to other works.  Sullivan may have been nominated for a Pulitzer for another story, but in my opinion he should stay away from horror because he just doesn't seem to understand how to express it or build it up.  I really would not recommend this one.	2005-07-25

Just how Toomey has managed to make a shark, a turtle and a hermit crab so in synch with the trials and tribulations of hairless beach ape life (us) is really pure comic genius.

These are in keeping with the television show, but not the original stories by Reverend Awdry.  For instance you will notice references to Sir Topham Hatt as he is known on television (in the books he is The Fat Controller). <br /> <br />In Cranky Bugs, Thomas and Percy have to deal with a new crane at the docks.  Cranky, the crane, does not like small engines but learns his lesson. <br /> <br />Put-Upon Percy has Percy working very hard and getting very dirty.  But after some excitement at the mines, Percy is rewarded with having a new coat of paint put upon him. <br /> <br />Finally, Sir Topham Hatt has trouble getting to Lady Hatt's birthday celebration.  Utilizing many vehicles, and getting dirtier with each one, he manages to get to the celebration just in time. <br /> <br />Each of the three stories is illustrated with stills from the television show.  Some are small and some are large.  While it may seem absurd to an adult that a piece up burlap can hold back an avalanche (in Put-Upon Percy), kids really enjoy these stories.	2005-07-20

But before they can get started, Pilchard the cat climbs a shaky tree and gets stuck upside-down right over the pond.  The trucks rally with Bird to find Bob and Wendy.  But in the end all is well. <br /> <br />The book uses stills from the television show to illustrate the story.  Each page has one picture that fills the whole page except the bottom where the text is.  The text is a little clumsy.  It reads like a transcript of the script with 'said Bob', 'said Muck', etc. stuck at the end of each line.  But while a little clumsy to read the first time or two, the kids seem to really like it.	2005-07-20

The art is just as endearing as in previous volumes but the story really misses the mark. <br /> <br />In previous special event flap books, we see Biscuit and the Girl-in-purple-sneakers experience holidays and events from a child's perspective.  But each manages to say something about how a child experiences the event/holiday.  But in this one, there is no information about what is going on other than it is a graduation.  After reading it to my kids I had to explain what went on and what graduations are.  Still, they liked the pictures and Biscuit was a cute as ever but personally I felt the author could have filled in a few of the gaps.	2005-07-20

Mr. Conductor has been left in charge of the yard but he has lost his sparkle and needs more gold dust.  Are you with me?  Well, Toby and Thomas get involved, there is a chase and we meet Lady, who Thomas has brought back from the Magic Railroad.  Lady is the source of the gold dust Mr. Conductor needs. <br /> <br />Our kids like this book but we (parents) don't like it as much as the more \\"real\\" Thomas adventures.  This book uses drawings instead of stills from the show so it has a different look from the other softcover books.  If your child likes Thomas and the Magic Railroad, they will probably really like this one.	2005-07-20

The Huntress shows up for only a few scenes.  Most of the book is more stage setting for the conflict to come.  Carlos, one close to the Huntress, is a target for a lot of powerful factions.  They all want his help and can offer him different rewards. <br /> <br />Most of the flaws of the first book are still here.  Characters continue to change their speech patterns left and right.  We learn a lot more about the Huntress and her role in history but most of the effects of her Awakening aren't seen in this volume (although they should be). <br /> <br />The big conflict that the first volume was building for cam off as a disappointment although I am sure there will be more repercussions in the next volume.  After all, the whole story only lasted a couple of days.  Although the predicted conflict of the first book is over, this volume predicts more troubles ahead so you will want to have the third volume waiting when you finish this one.	2005-07-19

A very interesting tale. <br /> <br />Finally we return to Fabletown as a new Mayor begins to take charge, or tries to, and Snow goes into labor.  Soon the babies are born and Snow takes them off to The Farm.  Unfortunately Bigby is not allowed on the farm.  He sulks and broods and takes off while a new mystery with deadly consequences reveals itself.  Some of Bigby's family also shows up to help with the kids.

Georgia is concerned about having snogged Dave the Laugh earlier and is following the Sex God's music career which seems to be really taking off.  It looks like he will be on tour in Hamburger-a-go-go-land (the United States).  She would really like to go along on the trip but there is almost nothing of her plans on how to do so. <br /> <br />The real unifying theme is Angus and the cat across the road and her pregnancy.  But otherwise it is just Georgia reacting to school, family, friends and the universe.  But despite the lack of any real theme, this is a very funny book.  Smiles and laughter accompanied my reading of this book more than during the third volume.  Definitely a very fun read. <br /> <br />My only actual problem with the book is that Georgia herself seems a little meaner or callous in this book.  That doesn't detract from the humor, but I think it hurts reader's ability to really like her.  But you will have to read it and decide for yourself.	2005-07-15

Characters are introduced and stages are set, but very little actually happens.  This the a special edition with a new beginning, added scenes, and steamier sex (or so the book claims).  These changes were made based on reader input after the first edition was released.  Funny that readers did not request an actual plot. <br /> <br />Plot aside, the book teaches us about the Vampire Hunters and the Guardians that they are part of.  We meet the current Hunter who is a woman.  We meet some of the other Guardians that she works with.  We also get descriptions of vampires, their history and the personal history of  the main bad guy.  All of this is actually quite interesting and probably necessary to reading the following books, but there is no real story here. <br /> <br />The characters are a little unusual.  Each character seems to have thought and speech patterns that don't go together.  In speaking, characters bounce back and forth between slang-ridden talk and cultured college English.  Oddly enough when characters are stressed, they don't lapse into more comfortable speech patterns, but start speaking with less slang and better grammar and that is the reverse of what usually happens. <br /> <br />The Guardians themselves have grown from traditions from all cultures, races and religions but there is very little evidence of this in this first book.  Sure, there is an occasional catch-phrase thrown in but for the most part it is very narrow in scope (at least in this volume). <br /> <br />But despite the flaws this book ends with the reader really wanting to know what is going to happen next.  It is a good start to a series but very poor as a stand-alone book.  Make sure you have THE AWAKENING on hand before you start this one as you will want to go right into it.	2005-07-14

We slowly learn what is going on and why and reach a conclusion that some may find a little short or weak but which really works with the rest of the book. <br /> <br />Spider Robinson has crafted a wonder place populated by countless references to popular and obscure works of fiction.  The park is believable and that really helps the story along.  Mike and Annie are wonderful characters and I would love to see a sequel in the future.  This book is simply fun and delightful.  Check it out.	2005-07-12

After Death	Books	2	9	12	N	N	Non-Chilling Ghost Story	This is a strange book that promises to be about ghosts.  There are ghosts in the way there is food in My Dinner With Andre.  They may be there, but they are not the story.  Instead we meet a film maker and photographer who is at a very low point in his life.  He has no real work (other than odd jobs for a rich eccentric), no wife, one of his children was murdered and he is a recovering alcoholic.  Things really could not get much worse. <br /> <br />But things do change when a chance encounter at the rich eccentric's house puts him in touch with a start-up telecom company.  They have a new product that is to cell phones what cell phones are to two cans and a piece of string.  Unfortunately the bandwidth the devices use pass through the realm of the dead.  Sounds spooky, right?  Wrong.  For a ghost story, we don't get any noticeable ghost activity until the second half of the book (around page 175).  Most of the story reads like a seedier version of Bradbury's WHO KILLED CONSTANCE.  Strange characters and countless references to the film and photography industry make this more of a tribute to or a eulogy for the industry than a ghost story. <br /> <br />The ghosts in the book (mostly off-stage) do cause the main character to start asking questions.  He questions himself, his family, his career and mostly what really happened to his dead daughter.  But while there are ghosts in the book it is not a ghost story.  While there is a serial killer in the book it is not a thriller.  It is more just a simple look at a man's life and how it cam to reach this low point.  Oh, there are a few minor revelations, but really nothing special.  If you liked Bradbury's WHO KILLED CONSTANCE you might like this one but if you are looking for Straub's GHOST STORY or a book version of Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense, then you will be disappointed. <br /> <br />Unfortunately I was put off right at the start of the book as I read s number of descriptive flaws in the first three pages.  I foundit inexcusable for an established author such as Bear to get minor details so wrong.	2005-07-06

But what is THE CULT OF FLESH really?  Well, I'm not sure and I just finished reading it.  The story centers around a poet living in Paris.  He has decided to give up on his unremarkable career and spend his days pursuing a hedonistic lifestyle by immersing himself in the pleasures of the flesh.  But as the story opens, he makes the acquaintance of a beautiful woman and is introduced to Count Vico. <br /> <br />Count Vico is central to the story but we know little about him.  He seems to be of evil intent.  One character calls him the Anti-Christ.  James Joyce wrote of a Count by the same name.  But whatever he is, he seems in control of the lives of many people.  Soon our protagonist is deeply involved with the Counts machinations and flees to Spain in the company of a beautiful woman.  Eventually he winds up back in Paris and we learn more of the Count and his control of others. <br /> <br />Oddly, this book is written by a poet and is about a poet.  In one scene, the main character meets someone with the author's name.  Is this a poet's attempt at describing a philosophy of freedom, or is it the justification of free love?  Whatever you feel it may represent, it is done by mixing non-erotic sex scenes with the spouting of philosophy.  While the book is packaged to resemble erotica and it is packed with sexual encounters, it is not an erotic work.  It is often very explicit but never titillating.  It is not erotica or horror.  It is instead a philosophical exercise that probably sold better marketed as erotica than it would have as philosophy.	2005-07-06

Darkseid captures a spacecraft that passes too close to Apokalips.  While Superman enjoys not having to rescue anyone, Darkseid discovers the aliens and hatches a plan against New Genesis. <br /> <br />Soon New Genesis is under attack from Parademons.  As Superman and the New Gods fight them off, they are astounded when the attackers suddenly stop and aliens burst out of their chests.  Superman goes into a rage while the New Gods try to stop the flood of aliens.  Then Superman and Orion take the fight to Darkseid and the Alien queen. <br /> <br />I have never been a fan of the Darkseid or New Gods stories (they should have been wiped out in the Crisis) and this one is not much better.  Since this is not an Elseworlds tale, there is not a lot of room for maneuvering in the plot.  Needless to say it is a minor skirmish in the great war between the two worlds (as they all are).  I was surprised at Superman's vacation attitude.  It is not explained why he is there but he seems completely unconcerned about anything that mike be happening in his absence.  There was also the gratuitous \\"Big Barda strolling in her Bikini\\" scene that was followed by Orion posing in his briefs.  <br /> <br />I felt the Aliens were not handled well either.  There is no menace, only one scene of stalking, and the resolution was unresolved.  Barda got away from the aliens on New Genesis but were they stopped?  No one bothered to check.  Darkseid seemed very careless about breeding face-huggers and chest-bursters.  There are scenes on Apokalips that shown many aliens have burst forth but the story does not account for any of them.  All in all this was a disappointment.	2005-06-30

Just as the book stopped, we did not know what he found at his son's house.  This book takes up just before the end of the first with a little repetition and we finally find out the status of Jim's son. <br /> <br />Right from the start Jim, Martin, Frankie and the rest of the party are on the run from organized zombies.  We have zombies torching houses and mounting high-speed chases.  This all gets Jim and company into a New York skyscraper reputed to be impenetrable.  The part joins several hundred survivors in the building.  Meanwhile Ob and the zombies are mobilizing on a grand scale.  Their talk is to wipe out all humans so that the next wave can begin (plants and insects). <br /> <br />Death and gore are major parts of this book (as in the first).  We learn a little more about the zombies and their purpose.  The action builds and builds as the book enters the final phases.  With only a dozen pages to go fates are still unknown and the reader has to go right to the final page.  Unlike the first book, this does wind up the saga although many readers will probably not like the way the ending is handled.  Personally I felt there could have been a few more pages or paragraphs at the end to fully close the book. <br /> <br />Still, the book was fun to read and it was a pleasure to find out how things went after the end of THE RISING.  You are going to have to read it to find out what happens but I will warn you that at the very end you may not be completely satisfied.	2005-06-29

It is called Voyeur.  A bunch of contestants are living in \\"the house\\" together with hundreds of cameras and microphones.  Two people have already been eliminated by audience voting.  As the book opens, things have been kicked up a notch as one of the female contestants has taken to not wearing panties.  She is bent over cleaning the oven while the other contestants criticize her actions. <br /> <br />But the panty stunt has opened a can of worms.  The contestants become more daring with a bout of sex by the pool.  Soon all bets are off.  But someone seems to be keeping a clear head and keeping their eye on the million-dollar prize.  Contestants are disqualified and voted out until there is a final winner. <br /> <br />An interesting story of sex, scheming, and subterfuge.  The cover says \\"Vol. 1\\" but the story seems to have a very final ending.  If there are future volumes they may be thematic instead of direct sequels or they may go for the further adventures of the winner.  We will have to wait and see.  The are is in clean black and white with the characters just bordering on the cartoonish.  The action is what you would expect without pushing any of the taboos.

Navee is off to see Ribwund who was sent to prison in an earlier adventure.  She hopes to get information regarding the planet traffickers who have infiltrated Wake at all major levels. <br /> <br />In the first story, Navee's craft is sabotaged and she crashes on an unknown planet.  There she is befriended by a local species that seems to be in perpetual war with machines.  The war has split the society into the men who are soldiers and the women who are protected and do all of the rest of the work including providing sexual favors to successful soldiers.  Strong-willed Navee, placed with the women, finally rebels at the end of the day instead of providing rewards.  She then proceeds to use her unique talents to effect major changes on the world, its society, and the war. <br /> <br />With her ship repaired, Navee continues her mission in the second story.  She infiltrates Ribwund's prison just as major riots break out.  They may be a cover to assassinate the ex-general.  Navee manages to get caught right in the middle of things.  We have long-standing crime rivals, rioting, cover-ups and a surprise character that has encountered humans prior to meeting Navee.  But no matter how tough the odds, Navee is not a quitter. <br /> <br />Both stories are really part of a whole.  The series overall seems to be moving in a more coherent direction that in the first three books (although this volume has serious ties to volume two).  A lot happens in this book and a lot of it will have repercussions on later stories.  It really makes me wish that the next volume would come out right away.  This volume does not stand alone very well and volumes two and four really should be read in order to understand what is really going on.  Check it out.	2005-06-29

He usually does this by putting a character in a situation where the normal restraints of civilization are at least temporarily absent.  But a few of his books deal with the survivor and just how far a true survivor is willing to go to survive.  This is one such book.  The human monster in this book starts out as one although some readers will see a resemblance to the one in QUAKE. <br /> <br />A young substitute teacher named Sherry meets a human monster and gets sucked right into a world of terror.  It starts when her boyfriend pops out to a convenience store to buy some condoms late one night while the Santa Ana winds blow.  Shortly after Sherry's world gets turned over and then torn apart as the monster gets a hold of her.  The monster also threatens her family.  Sherry is subjected to a whole slew of horrors and degradations until the monster is done with her and moves on to her younger sister Brenda.  Brenda gets a similar treatment along with some of her school mates.  Does anyone survive?  That is the beauty of a Laymon book.  You can never be sure who will survive although you can usually guess a bunch that won't. <br /> <br />What makes this Laymon book different from say AFTER MIDNIGHT, is that we follow two different survivors, Sherry and then her sister.  We also meet a few others along the way.  But the read, with all of it's twist, turns and surprises, is all pure Laymon and no Laymon fan will be disappointed by this one.  Definitely check it out.	2005-06-28

But all good things must come to an end and the vacation is over and its time for a new book. <br /> <br />This was one of the better entries in this series.  I have always liked Lucy.  This book manages to deal with some strong issues in a good way and still maintain a lightness one associates with these books.  Well done.	2005-06-24

But oddities aside, Tiffany begins her training unaware that the Hiver is after her.  Eventually all th plot threads come together with both humor and seriousness until the whole thing winds up in a very satisfactory manner. <br /> <br />Terry Pratchett has produced another wonderful young-folks book written in his usual style of wit.  Pratchett manages to do a perfect job of getting across the brogue used by the Pictsies without making it harder to read.

The volume is a smaller format than the individual books, but still large enough for proper reading. <br /> <br />Each of the tales tries to give a well-rounded picture of what to expect from the experience.  For instance, in the doctor visit the family has three kids who each need a different type of treatment.  Each story starts out by introducing the family and each family is different in composition although none are single parent families.  Each page tells an aspect of the experience with a more detailed description at the bottom.  Each story also contains a small yellow rubber duck hiding somewhere (my favorite is where he is hiding during the metal detector section of going on a plane). <br /> <br />Obviously the families presented will not always mimic your own and many experiences will be different in some details, but they still offering an excellent way to get into the subject with your children and start a discussion.  Each tale has a different expert consultant but they are all delightfully illustrated by Stephen Cartwright.  Check it out.	2005-06-24

His home dimension is being taken over by Bane Mite and he needs a hero.  Bob becomes that hero. <br /> <br />Action moves to Bat Mite's world and we see how Bane Mite is taking over.  But while Bob manages to overcome Bane Mite and save an entire dimension, in our home dimension he dies without anyone knowing he had reformed and become a hero. <br /> <br />To really appreciate this story you have to be able to tolerate Bat Mite and have a knowledge of the Knightfall sequence in Batman.  The parallels are well done and the story manages to not be too cute.  It is actually quite dark.  Bob's position as the unknown hero is a classic in literature and is handled very well in this tale.	2005-06-22

This is the story of a young boy who is fascinated with bugs.  This passion has earned him a bad reputation with other children, his teachers and his family.  Then one day he finds a very strange bug which stings him. <br /> <br />Having been stung, the boy's body begins to undergo a transformation until he looks like a giant version of the bug that stung him.  He is then driven from his home and takes refuge in the sewers.  A second transformation occurs but this time it is of his mind and not body.  Slowly he forgets that he was once a boy.  He also loses his sense of right and wrong and delights in killing people.  But a chance encounter with his old family brings out his old memories and he understands what he has done and become.  Penance is sought. <br /> <br />This is more a tragic story than one of horror.  Although one may not understand the boy's mental metamorphosis, it is easy to understand his horror when his mind clears.  Although it has taken much from the Kafka story, it also share a lot with the Jeff Goldblum version of The Fly.  Check it out.	2005-06-22

It is huge and surrounded by a dark forest.  He has never been able to leave the house, always running bach scared to a new section he did not know.  One hallway is blocked by a large mirror.  It is said by the boy's grandfather that the mirror prevents the demons on the other side from getting through.  But even stranger than the house is the boy's family.  Among them is a grandmother who thinks she is a chicken and lives in a big nest.  The boy seems to be the only normal one in the house. <br /> <br />One day the boy sees a crack in the mirror.  He is terrified that the demons can now come through.  The first evidence is a large red snake loose in the house.  From there things escalate at a frightening pace as the boy becomes witness to terrible horrors involving his family.  In the end we return to a narrative similar to the opening. <br /> <br />This is a strange one.  We never get any real idea of who these people are or what the house is.  It sort of reminds me of The Sentinel but there is nothing to indicate that the family is watching or guarding anything.  But despite all of that this still remains a very creepy story full of dark imagery and atmosphere.  A pretty good choice to lead of this new series of Hino's work.	2005-06-21

As the story opens it is revealed that a mummy found at the site is actually a Spanish priest.  The news of this discovery sets many powerful wheels in motion; the first of which causes a collapse of the dig and the entrapment of many of the crew. <br /> <br />As the crew tries to escape from the dig and the digs head mounts a rescue, we begin a journey that takes us through history, Incan legends, secret societies, and plenty of action and suspense. <br /> <br />Although the title might make one expect a similar setting to his first book, there is very little time spent inside caves or tombs.  This time the suspense comes from those who wish to gain something from this Incan site and a legend of \\"Satan's Blood\\"; a near magical substance that holds a key to an age-old secret plan.  Like the first book, there was some imbalance in eco systems where there seemed to be more predators than the food supply could allow but this time it is less important to the plot and therefore easier to overlook. <br /> <br />Both EXCAVATION and SUBTERRANEAN are better than AMAZONIA (his fourth book) with the stories being more complete.  Although I suspected some of the book's revelations, I didn't get them quite right.  Needless to say, giving too many details would lessen the effect of the book and it is one worth reading.	2005-06-21

Oliver Cromwell did not die when he did in our world, instead he rose from his sickbed and persisted for another decade.  Because of this, the mother church is in full control of Britain and the New World colonies (and much of the world that they have conquered).  Here a young Bruce Wayne has finally found peace after the death of his parents.  He is about to take his vows with the church when Inquisitor Gordon reveals that Wayne's parents were rebels and were executed my the Church in a way made to look like a random crime.  Now Bruce does not know what to do. <br /> <br />His confidence in the church has been shaken and Bruce sets out to revenge himself on those that decided to kill his parents.  But his quest leads him higher and deeper as he discovers that there are people with amazing abilities that have been either enslaved by the church or imprisoned.  Bruce sees that his problem is not with the Church itself but with the way some men are wielding its power.  With his faith strong Wayne continues to don an old demon costume of his father's and goes out to fight the injustice of the system. <br /> <br />This was one of the best of the Elseworlds tales.  The alternate history worked well and the parallel heroes that Bruce discovers were very well done.  While Gotham By Gaslight had a couple of sequels, this one has remained alone although it is rich enough to spawn many new tales.  Check it out.	2005-06-21

Ashley is a an anthropologist chosen to lead a scientific team into the caverns and tunnels.  She is accompanied by people of other disciplines including spelunkers, geologists, and biologists.  Two guards also accompany the party. <br /> <br />But just as the expedition begins, they learn they were not the first team.  The first team has been missing for weeks.  But this time a communications net has been set up to prevent anyone else from getting lost.  But as the party moves along it is quickly realized that the dangers go hand in hand with the wonders and soon it becomes a simple matter of survival.  Twists and turns in the caves and the plot carry the adventures through dangers both natural and manmade until the final conclusion of the book. <br /> <br />I have to say I enjoyed this one better than AMAZONIA (the author's fourth book) as it held together well.  Only one passage bothered me when the characters decided to stay in the well-lit areas just after deciding the well-lit areas were the most dangerous but otherwise I really enjoyed this exploration into the underground world.  The author created some nice ties between what is found and some legends.  I liked the characters (although I would have liked to know more about why Linda seemed drawn to Khalid) and the action was good.  I would also have liked more explanation about the wormholes, their origins, how big they are and how certain predators actually fit through them.  But still, for a first novel it really is quite good and does not pull any of the cheap stunts like in AMAZONIA.	2005-06-14

There is plenty of obsession and no small amount of madness making this a tale of tragedy but, other than the cover, there is little to describe it as horror.  By the end of the book I was glad it was short.  Some readers will be disappointed in the ending while others will drop out before then.  Beware.	2005-06-13
212779:US	38672733	R2MOS2EB6LEZT6	1932815139	231936988	Dark Planet	Books	1	8	8	N	N	Bad Bad Bad	I won't go into how this novel came about as other reviewers have covered that pretty well.  But I will say that it is always possible that it may have been the author's agent that made sure this book made it to the stands and not the author. <br /> <br />This book is really bad.  Set in another author's universe, a military team is sent to a hostile planet to check if the alien Blobs have established a base there.  The main character is not human although the rest of the cast is.  During the course of the book the focus seems to change.  Is it military SF, SF horror, adventure, or what? <br /> <br />The planet is inhabited by giant bugs and reptiles.  Really giant like from some old pulp.  They all are very dangerous and would love to each the team.  That is except when the plot calls for the nasties to all stay away or placid for long periods (more and more as the book progresses).  Eventually the story moves to an object quest as one tries to keep the object out of the wrong hands. <br /> <br />The book starts by quickly establishing the dangerous nature of the planet and then slowly abandons the idea.  Interspecies romance, although frowned upon by all species, seems to crop up an awful lot.  Like Burroughs's Barsoom, the planet seems to be inhabited entirely by carnivores.  The action is choppy at best.  Being set in another author's universe leaves it feeling like there is a lot of information left out.  All in all, it is just not a good book.	2005-06-07

The author chose to use a thriller format to get his ideas and warnings across.  Unfortunately I feel he failed in his mission by relying too much on imagery even when it doesn't match the facts. <br /> <br />The richest man in the world is assassinated just before he is to make a world-shaking announcement.  A reporter is determined to find out why he was killed.  The story quickly leads her to a scientist funded by the trillionaire.  He has just crack the secret of nanotechnology.  Others are also on his trail and a game of cat and mouse ensues wherein we get to see both the benefits and the horrors of nanotechnology. <br /> <br />While the thriller was pretty good, I couldn't help being put off by the misinformation and lack of crucial details.  For instance, the nano assemblers can build things atom by atom like a kid building with blocks.  We first see this with a tree.  But the tree is not assembled, it is grown at super speed.  The ground sinks as the tree grows.  Unfortunately plants get most of their mass from the air, not the ground.  Also, trees are mostly dead objects covered by a veneer of living cells.  A rapid-growing tree would probably not \\"die\\" fast enough.  Later we are given an example of how disassemblers work.  The scientist pulls apart a molecular model and throws the pieces away.  No mention of how the strong forces are overcome, or that atoms are not solid balls the same way the solar system isn't.  No mention of what a nanite can be made of if it is small enough to get between atoms to pry them apart. <br /> <br />These are two simple examples but the book is full of even worse.  For example, if nanites are so small, the distance between a person's hands and feet would be nearly astronomical.  So how do nanites know when they first reach someone's feet, if that person is holding someone else's hand?  What about energy?  How long will it really take a nanite to crawl any macro distance?  How much information can really be programmed into an individual nanite?  If nanites disassemble pollution, the atoms are still there.  Lead is still lead and mercury is still mercury.  How do they get rid of it? <br /> <br />But still, if you don't care about the science or if it makes sense, then the pace of the book is sure to keep you going and wondering what is going to happen next.  But otherwise you might want to stay away from this one.  You choose.	2005-06-06

Lenore and Spiaggi are still on the trail of the truth. <br /> <br />Here Lenore first meets the Raptors and what they represent.  We also meet Aznar Akeba and learn some of his fate in all of this.  We learn of the origin of the current troubles.  We also learn of Lenore's family and how it has shaped her. <br /> <br />While this is less of a complete adventure it does serve very well to move the plot along and develop the main threads.  Although the story remains fresh, there is something almost deja vous about Lenore's predicament near the end of the volume. <br /> <br />Once again the story develops and moves at a good pace while being backed by excellent artwork.  The story continues and the reader wants to follow it to its conclusion.	2005-06-06

Each of the victims have been killed with a simple pin stuck into a cyst they each had behind their left ears.  The investigation takes them to corruption and secrets that have been kept for centuries. <br /> <br />The world is not as they had thought.  There is a grand conspiracy that began ages ago and has taken control of almost the entire world.  One of the things it does not control are a brother and sister, the Raptors, who have decided that the kingdom of the conspiracy must come to an end.  The more they learn about the truth, the more danger they are in. <br /> <br />At first Lenore reminded me of Ellen Yindell from The Dark Knight Returns but she quickly took on her own unique personality.  The story was quite good.  It had a definite ending while still setting up the other books in the series.  I thought it made for a great start.  Ir pulled no punches and it did not dicker around.  The action and revelations came fast and furiously.  A very entertaining read backed with excellent artwork. <br />	2005-06-06

This book is no exception.  Although the title seems simple and pure, the book delves into depths of darkness and evil as opposite of that as possible. <br /> <br />In the beginning we meet David as he first meets the girl who has just moved next door to him.  Meg and her younger sister Susan are staying with friends of David's.  The girls are staying there because they have lost their parents and their second cousins are their closest relatives.  David is quite taken by the slightly older Meg.  But Meg is having are hard time dealing with her new \\"family\\".  Like Cinderella was put upon by her step mother and sisters, Meg can not seem to please them. <br /> <br />As the story unfolds, we see Meg subjected to greater and greater punishments and degradations.  David is both appalled and fascinated by what is going on.  The story takes the reader on a wild ride wondering just how wild and far the story will go.  But things are not over once the story ends.  Readers must read the author's note on how he came to write this dark and disturbing tale.  The reader is has the opportunity to step bach and realize just what a creation Jack Ketchum has created in this book. <br /> <br />Not for the squeamish or the easily troubled.  Some aspects of the book reminded me of Lord of the Flies.  But unlike that book where civilization is thrown off on a remote island, this tale takes place in the heart of civilization.  Brrr.	2005-06-06

Rob the advertiser, his neurotic cat, and his sweet but often simple dog have a strange but effective way of showing humor in some of the oddest places.

Gone are all of the side trips to Dilbert's home, Ratbert's antics, strange dates, and other non-office stories.  While many such have been quite funny, this series goes back to what Dilbert is all about; the office. <br /> <br />Dilbert, Wally, Alice, Asok, Tina and the rest of the staff have to deal with and survive the madness that is management, marketing, payroll and the executives.  They do so with their usual style.  Among the story arcs in this collection are: <br />The Secret Society of Executive Secretaries <br />The cursed and deadly binders <br />The Non-Credible Guy <br />The Prima Donna <br />The New Hire <br />Dilbert and stopped time <br />Bribery <br />The Ultra-Donut <br /> <br />And many, many more in a collection of wit, humor, and an almost scary dose of reality that has you thinking Scott Adams works in your office.	2005-06-06

She gets grounded to the Solar system and Nita and Kit take her place.  Dairine then gets to show three visiting wizards around. <br /> <br />Nita and Kit and Ponch, Kit's dog, travel to a giant planet that seems to be a paradise of peace and happiness.  Back home Dairine entertains the three visitors, one of whom seems to be a royal pain.  It seems simple enough but The Powers are always at work and they don't do anything for no purpose.  The characters must all discover what is really going on around them and deal with it as only responsible wizards can. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book but I felt it was trying to be a little too Harry Potterish.  Unusual when you realize the series is decades older than Harry.  There also seemed to be the Potterish inattention to magic details.  One example has a magic item fold itself closed to conserve energy but then remains hovering (not conserving as much as it could, apparently).  Mostly the magic seemed too free and cute.  But underneath we still had a good story with real choices and consequences like in the earlier books. <br /> <br />We learn a little more about how Nita and family are dealing with the loss of Nita's mother.  We also get a better look at Kit's family and how they are coping with the presence of magic in their household.  We even get a little more about Ponch but real developments on that front will have to be revealed in the future.  Finally, this book does a better job of preparing for the next volume with some foreshadowing and minor unsolved threads.  Check it out.	2005-06-01

Paying a lot for a single short story just doesn't seem right. But, when I can find one used for a decent price, I might check it out.  <br /> <br />This is a strange tale of the repossession business.  One young man is out on his first job.  He is accompanied by a hardened partner who is full of boasts and tales and shares them with delight while trying to impress/scare the new kid.  How true any of his statements are is left for the reader to decide. <br /> <br />The one thing we know for sure is that the older partner is fully aware of the nature of their first target and is taking delight in springing it on the new kid.  As the title would suggest, they are attempt to take possession of a hearse.  In the middle off the night. <br /> <br />A nice little tale. It is a very quick read, only a few pages in regular size, but crafted so that the story moves and reaches an acceptable resolution.  <br /> <br />I wouldn't recommend paying a lot for this one but it is worth reading.	2005-05-31

It lacks the quality of his second and the originality of his first.  It also shows he doesn't know what year this is. <br /> <br />The story concerns an aging rocker who has recently hit the big time.  He has a daughter but his wife was killed in a car accident.  After a long tour, he returns home and starts having episodes where he is disconnected and hears voices.  He is afraid he may be cracking up and sees a doctor. <br /> <br />But eventually we learn that demons and possession are real and our protagonist is going to have to confront the title bad guy.  The Demonologist took control of the demons known as Legion that Jesus cast out into some pigs.  This occurs long after Jesus cast them out and the author states that it was over two thousand years ago (say what?). <br /> <br />In the end the reader is subjected to scenes of perversion that Edward Lee would probably never have used.  We also feel a lack of a certain element from the story which is unusual considering its nature.  All in all it seemed pointless, careless and rushed.  It could have been much better with a little more work.	2005-05-31

The something was picked up by the sub's equipment but was not seen from the surface.  Thus a private research tem is brought in to help with the sensing and a second sub has an accident.  The private researchers think there may be a giant megalodon shark at work but have to keep quiet about their unsupported ideas. <br /> <br />As the Navy continues to hold a presence in international waters, they attract the attention of the Russians (it is still the Cold War).  Now we have the Navy, the Russians, the researchers, a dolphin and whale team, and a family of giant sharks all coming together in a not-quite thriller where the story really happens in the final ten pages. <br /> <br />Although this may be the first megalodon novel, it is not the first story as one by Alan Dean Foster inspired Peter Benchley to write JAWS.  It may lack some of the shark action of EXTINCT or MEG but it does a better job of trying to insert the sharks into reality.  So while the action is less, the world realism is greater and you will have to decide for yourself which is more important.	2005-05-31

When we first met Artemis Fowl he was an evil genius looking to restore the family fortune.  His First scheme involved the world of fairies.  His second adventure had him searching for his father.  Now with his father bach and his mother healthy, Artemis plans one last job before going straight.<br /><br />Using fairy technology, Artemis hopes to get money out of a shady technologies dealer.  But before he knows it, Artemis has a new quest.  Now he must work to save his bodyguard, Butler.  But he must also stop his previous mark from utilizing the fairy technology.  Artemis's genius shines brightly in this one as his evil ways are tempered.<br /><br />The quest takes Artemis to Chicago and brings in many characters from the previous books as well as introducing some interesting new ones.  Unfortunately the descriptions of Chicago bore no similarity to reality (I can only guess that the author assumed Chicago was like New York).  But even those mistakes didn't really detract from the pace or enjoyment.  The ending was interesting, unexpected, and acceptable and we now know that there will be more books about Artemis Fowl.	2005-05-31

Something about the storm does not feel right.  The rain seems luminous and there is an odd odor to it.  Soon she and husband Neil realize that something is not right.  They hear reports of rain everywhere and other odd happenings.  Then on a news report and a call from a relative they see there is real danger and that safety may be in numbers.  They set out for town. <br /> <br />Both the journey to town and what they find there lead them to make some tough decisions.  While the townsfolk take sides on the best way to handle the situation, Molly and Neil set out to explore the homes and protect the children who may be in trouble.  But even before they start out they encounter some facts about what might be going on.  Not wanting to decide if their efforts are futile or not, they continue on their quest. <br /> <br />In the end I was not surprised by the ending, its implications or how it was carried about.  I will say there is a slight flaw with one of the final revelations but I will have to leave it to the reader to discover it as revealing it now could ruin the reading experience.  The book is fun despite the darkness of the story because Koontz pulls out all the stops on references to other fiction.  Movie and book references abound and the reader will have fun placing them all.  In that way this is different from most of Koontz's books I have read over the years. <br /> <br />A fast story complete with suspense, creepiness, mystery, and a dose of humor.  Certainly worth reading.	2005-05-17

In Miami there are more than 100,000 of them.  Many vampires trace back to bites from vampire bats.  Vampires can also be made with a bite from a vampire or being born to one.  In this world the Del Torro rules the Miami crime world.  They are very rich and very influential.  A new deal with a pharmaceutical company may enable them to go completely legit. <br /> <br />In this story we follow the members of the Del Toros after the head of the family is murdered at the start.  We mostly follow Leto and Risa, brother and sister.  One is a catholic priest (a first for vampires) while Risa runs a record company.  But both are true to the family name.  As the story progresses we meet a very wide range a characters and their foibles, desires, and place in the scheme of things. <br /> <br />The story is pretty good although much of it reads like an introduction of characters with the plot taking back seat.  But still, it was a pretty good read although not really memorable.  This is collected from the Vertigo mini series and contains quite a bit of nudity, sex, and violence so it is not suitable for many readers.  The format is also rather small and some readers will take issue with that.	2005-05-17

We meet Sergeant Vincent D'Agosta again as well.  The murder scene has clues that make it look like the Devil did the deed.  But soon a second murder takes Pendergast and Vincent to New York City were the investigation really gets under way. <br /> <br />As clues are collected and the investigation proceeds, we learn more of Pendergast's history and what makes him tick.  Unlike most mysterious characters in fiction, Pendergast actually stands up to explanation and remains mysterious.  We also learn a little more of what has been happening to Vincent and where he is going.  But all through that Pendergast's unique style carries the story forward. <br /> <br />This is not a story filled with red herrings or forgotten clues.  It is a well-constructed mystery populated by a wonderful cast of characters, good and bad.  If you enjoyed THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES then you will probably like this one as it is closer in style than STILL LIFE WITH CROWS.  When the final page is turned the reader is left wanting to know more about what will happen to the characters.  A great read.	2005-05-17

The Ghostbusters have been working hard since the events of the last movie and the current Mayor has been capitalizing upon their successes.  This leads an independent political party to choose Dr. Peter Venkman to run for Mayor. <br /> <br />But as the campaign begins, it becomes clear that there is something big in the paranormal works.  Ghosts are showing up in the form of urban legends; ghosts that shouldn't exist.  There is also a mention of something called Xanthador (no, this is not the Piers Anthony demon nor is it the same name).  Through it all we have Peter and Dana still defining their relationship, Ray and Egon are still deeply engrossed in the bizarre, and the humor flows like a river of slime. <br /> <br />The author does an excellent job of keeping the characters true to the movies.  Almost from the first page when Louis is talking about a missing pen the reader can hear the voices and inflections.  I have never been a fan of Slimer being a mascot but that is not the fault of this author.  But the scenes with the villain seem more in keeping with the cartoon show than with the movies.  One of the reasons the movies worked so well was that at the heart of the trouble there was a very real threat that was not fueled by comedy, something lacking in the cartoons.  This book falls somewhere in-between the two in its handling of dark forces. <br /> <br />Still, if you liked the movies and the characters, you should enjoy this book as the characters are true to form.  Check it out.	2005-05-17

First he parodies the elements of the tales themselves and then finishes them off by adding a dash of reality to them. <br /> <br />In this book we meet Caroline who has just gone through a lot of trouble and kissed a lot of frogs to rescue Prince Hal.  But Hal is not as promised.  He is neither handsome nor likely to ever sit on the throne and rule.  Caroline feels gypped and wants reparations from the estate of the witch that turned Hal into a frog. <br /> <br />This early set up send Caroline and cast to the big city where they find out some of the truths of how the world really works.  There are two truly handsome princes, either of whom might rule, glitz, glamor, magic, Rapunzel, Rumplestiltskin, and the expulsion of a minority.  It all wraps up in satisfactory fashion although maybe not as the reader thinks it will. <br /> <br />This is a very funny book that delivers laughs as well as a quick read.  If you have read SLAY AND RESCUE and enjoyed it, you will want to read this one.  If you have enjoyed this one, you will want to check out SLAY AND RESCUE.	2005-05-05

There we find ourselves on a generation ship known as Home.  The ship is an attempt to spread humanity far enough that a single calamity can not wipe it out.  Through the eyes of some of the inhabitants (crew and residents) we see some of the problems associated with and inherent in travel by way of generation ship. <br /> <br />The ship is a closed system and at this point in time everyone is aware that they are just a transition phase.  They have been born on the ship and they will never see its fruition.  It takes special planning and propaganda to keep the residents as productive as they need to be to keep the ship functioning for the unknown future generations.  We see a number of problems crop up both big and small and how the  characters handle the situations. <br /> <br />The book is quite different from the first as there is very little of the politicking and power plays that made up so much of the first volume.  But although quite different in tone, it is still a good story.  The author tends to close chapter sections with foreshadowing comments (i.e. He didn't realize how wrong he was) that keep the reader wanting to know more.  A nice technique that keeps the book moving right to the very end.	2005-04-18

(Ace Science Fiction)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	To The Stars	In the third book we are back to the Galaxy Exploration Team, now on Mars, and their efforts to create faster than light (FTL) travel.  It had long thought to be impossible, but contact with the aliens showed it could be done.  The project is important to humanity but may cause trouble for individual humans.  Some may even want to see the project fail.  But even without outside interference, there are still problems that need to be overcome, both technical and human. <br /> <br />Unmanned ships are tested and eventually a crew containing the GET is sent on a mission to Alpha Centauri.  The Generation ships are still very close to the Solar system and will be passed by if the tests are successful.  There is plenty of scheming and politicking, but from fewer parties than the first book (no Senate races or reporters this time). <br /> <br />Like with the second book, many of the chapter sections end with foreshadowing statements that drive the reader to want to continue reading.  Unfortunately the book did not get proofed well and typos abound.  Usually it is easy to tell what was meant at the time so it is not a real problem.  My one beef was that one of the villains had one motive at the beginning of the book but a different one later with no explanation.  Since we got into his head the first time we tend to believe it but there was nothing to refute the second. <br /> <br />The series is called The Exploration Chronicles and there is plenty of room for more books to be written in the series.  After enjoying the first three I hope that we will, indeed, see more.	2005-04-18

I had low expectations based on the confused-pun title but was surprised to discover that the author knew the difference between a changeling and a shape-shifter.  But the writing started off bad and seemed to pay little attention to the Charmed universe. <br /> <br />The book opens with a bounty hunter appearing in an elfin village.  She is there to take the babies.  She says she does not ask questions about her assignments and does not know why she has been asked to take them.  Within a single page she reveals the reason (huh?).  From there we move to more familiar territory as Piper is aching to get back to work now that her baby has been born.  With Paige's help, daycare is attempted but things don't work out.  Eventually the sisters notice patterns and coincidences and set out to solve the problem <br /> <br />This is one of the shortest books I have read in a long time (150 pages).  With very little room for plot complications I was quite surprised to find the Charmed ones out and out refusing to help misled innocents.  They not only refuse but do so angrily.  They only go back to help after Leo gets back with orders from the Elders.  This is like an alternate-universe Charmed where the characters look the same but have different personalities.  There are some good Charmed books out there but this is not one of them.	2005-04-07

It deals with a simple premise; a signal of most-likely intelligent origin has been detected from space.  How will the world react?    In Signals, Kevin D. Randle takes a look at the scientific, military, academic, political, and journalistic communities and how they react to the discovery of a signal that is probably intelligent in origin.  Members of each of these communities is highlighted as they try to better their careers with the news or get roped in by it.  Randle does an excellent job of predicting how some people would react.  From the first hours that the signal is detected all the way to a massive grandstand the story moves through believable paces.    At first this seems like a hard-science SF novel, but it really deals very little with the science and pays most of its attention to human nature and reaction.  I hope that the other books in this series are as good because it certainly started out on the right foot.	2005-04-07

Books	4	9	9	N	N	When Hype is Truth -- Challengers Reimaged	In the spirit of Dark Knight Returns, the Challengers of the Unknown get their turn at being rewritten.  As the story opens we get a reporter criticized for using the cheap cliche phrase \\"The Challengers Must Die!\\"  This leads him to go visit Challengerville and Challenger mountain.  However, no sooner does he arrive then the mountain blows up and almost completely destroys the town. <br /> <br />In the wake of the catastrophe, the surviving Challengers risk life and limb to help the innocent.  They are repaid by being arrested and eventually disbanded.  The Challengers pursue their own paths as action film hero, mystic, and mercenary.  But as their paths seem to be leading them apart, they are brought back together and reform to again challenge the unknown, this time in the form of a powerful villain who bellows that \\"The Challengers Must Die!\\" <br /> <br />I ordinally read this in individual issues and was happy to see it collected finally.  One does not really need to be familiar with the Challengers to enjoy this story.  While the Challengers have no special powers they truly are heros and this mini-series does them great credit.  Also included is a Challenger story that has previously remained unpublished.  It tries to explain inconsistencies between the mini-series and some other DC titles.  A fun read with powerful art, fun plot, and some cameos by Superman and Batman.  Check it out.	2005-04-07

Her friends are not.  Then a huge multi-school project is assigned to record the history of London.  T.J. finds herself in a group with Nesta's boyfriend. <br /> <br />Nesta's boyfriend seems to have the same interests as T.J.  Nesta asks T.J. to be friendlier to him.  He talks about breaking with Nesta to everyone but Nesta. <br /> <br />Now T.J. finds herself in the uncomfortable position of liking a guy and not wanting to hurt her friend.  But as said boyfriend seems to be playing an even wider field than originally thought, T.J. must make some very tough decisions if she is going to maintain her friendships with the other girls. <br /> <br />Pretty good but with a little less character development than the previous volumes.  Certainly T.J. must make decisions and changes but they are not the same type found earlier.  It is still a good story and provides a good lesson about dealing with your mates.	2005-04-06

While the dynamics of the events may not exactly match your own, it still works well as you can discuss what differences there are/might be.  For instance, in the book the grandparents watch the kids while the parents are off to the hospital while we had our daughter sleep over at a friends house the night of the event. <br /> <br />Each page or two has a title that points out some aspect like Preparing The Baby's Room.  There is then a brief description of how the Buns handle it.  As a nice addition to the book, there is a game included where the reader can try to find the little rubber duck that is hiding on each page spread. <br /> <br />This is a good book for preparing a child for a new sibling, but like all of the others, it should not be your only resource.  Get several or more on the topic.	2005-03-31

But unlike what most mother-daughter teams would be doing, Fran is tagging along with her mother who is a witch in a traveling psychic faire.  Fran does not feel that this is good or normal.  To make it worse, Fran can read people if she touches them.  Something her mother thinks she should use at the faire but which Fran is uncomfortable with.  Then a sexy motorcycle rider shows up.  He is the younger brother of one of Fran's few friends.  He is also a very old vampire.  While longevity goes with either sex, only the males can be true vampire.  And if that wasn't enough, the vampire tells fran that she is his beloved and only she can lift his curse. <br /> <br />Now Fran has a vampire follower who almost worships her, a talent she hates, a mystery of who is robbing the faire, and everything is just confused.  So Fran tries to hold off the vampire, agrees to use her talent to try and find the thief, and befriends a very special horse.  Sounds simple enough until she finds herself fighting for her life against demons. <br /> <br />The relationship between Fran and Benedikt (the vampire) develops but it is obvious there will be more stories involving these two.  The mystery was good and the action was acceptable.  Katie Maxwell has created a very interesting world where demons, vampires, psychics and magic all exist.  Her take on the vampire is new and fresh.  This is not just a vampire teen romance.  Check it out.	2005-03-29

But other than size, temperature, and scenery, she also discovers something else very different about the town.  Every day at midnight the rest of the world freezes but she, and several other kids, get an extra hour.  Unfortunately other, older and scarier, things also inhabit this time. <br /> <br />Jessica meets the other kids; Midnighters as they call themselves.  Each has a special talent related to the secret hour.  Jessica must have a talent but hers is not obvious.  Nor is Jessica sensitive to light in the same way as the others.  To make matters worse, the dark things seem to want her dead.  She must be a threat to them so it becomes important to figure out just what her special talent is and it could be dangerous. <br /> <br />This is a very nice start to a series.  I don't know how long they plan to go with this but it is off to a fast start.  Only one part bothered me.  Midnight is the true midnight, not one artificially created by time-zones, daylight savings, or other man-made definitions.  That is fine.  But apparently the arbitrary man-made definitions of latitude and longitude do have an effect.  I found that to be inconsistent.  Otherwise, the book was quite good and really kept me guessing.  There is still plenty to learn about the secret hour and I look forward to the next volume.	2005-03-29

It has had a long history of sexual depravity.  Recently an orgy turned into a slaughter as guests were killed and dismembered in ritualistic fashion.  Afterwards the owner was missing and presumed dead.  Now his widow is sending a team of psychics and a writer into the house to determine just what happened. <br /> <br />Very strong imagery is used to tie psychic and sexual ideas together.  The characters delve into the darkness of the house while fighting rising lusts that seem to be fed by the house itself.  A strange girl, a locked safe, disappearing bodies, abandoned cars, and more drive the plot forward to its horrible conclusion. <br /> <br />Like many Edward Lee books, this one is not for the squeamish or faint of heart.  The images of sex and violence are strong and far from vanilla mainstream.  The plot was interesting as were the characters but it is definitely only for fans of Lee's style of brutal writing.	2005-03-28

Jessica gets involved as she runs into the police on her way home from a second dinner at the home of her intended boyfriend.  She is the first to identify the victim.  Then her best friend tells her of another missing kid.  Suddenly it looks like hate crimes are springing up in the Southern Indiana town.    Jess can not believe what is going on but does manage to figure out who might be behind things.  She doesn't even have to use her powers to figure this out.  But now Jess feels she has to put a stop to things as she is convinced other authorities will blow it and another kid will die.    This is the most tense of book of the series.  A real white-knuckle read that runs full speed until the conclusion.  Don't miss it.	2005-03-22

Then lightning strikes and Jessica gets a jolt.  The next morning she knows where two people are.  She doesn't know who they are or why she knows until she sees them on the milk carton.  Yes, Jessica now has the ability to know where people are. <br /> <br />Jessica quickly learns the whereabouts of a number of kids on milk cartons and calls the number so that they can be located.  But this is the real world and authorities immediately notice the pattern and want to know who Jess is and how she knows where all of these missing kids are.  The FBI and the military both get involved.  When public scrutiny causes trouble in her household she agrees to have some tests. <br /> <br />But that is only the beginning and Jessica has to deal with her new talent and those who want to use her.  She also has to deal with issues about whether the kids are better off not being found.  It all becomes a mess. <br /> <br />This was a very well-written thriller.  Unlike so many teens-with-powers stories, this one really does a good job of trying to show how the real world would react.  As much fun as Cabot's Mediator books but more real and dark.

To make things worse, her celebrity status is not completely unknown amongst the campers and staff. <br /> <br />In reality, Jess has not lost her powers but has gone underground with them.  She secretly helps find kids who really need finding thanks to a contact at the kid search organization.  But events unfolding at the camp may cause her to reveal the truth.  She tries to publicly deny her ability but the FBI is still watching her.  Then a camper goes missing.  Jess, her love interest, and the FBI all get entangled as Jess tries to keep her life on a normal keel. <br /> <br />This is not just a rehash of the previous book.

There is no way she can allow a fellow student, no matter who they are, to be killed if she can do anything to prevent it.  But she still wants to hide her abilities.

Suze will have her hands full with this one. <br /> <br />Another good chapter in the life of mediator Suze Simon.

Most of the ghosts in the story are minor.  Instead the story focuses on the start of the new school year and a new student named Paul (from book 4). <br /> <br />Suze must try and avoid Paul and what he represents while trying to keep knowledge of him from Jesse.  But that is not as easy as it sounds.  Before she knows it, Suze is in an election for student government and Paul is her opponent.  Paul also seems to know more about mediators than anyone else and Suze wants to know more.  But it all comes to a head a various plot threads all meet at a wild party. <br /> <br />It was a pleasure to see things back to normal once again.  After the strangeness of book 4 it was nice to see Suze worrying about being home in time for dinner and seeing the elaborate meals her step-father prepares.  Much more in tune with the first three books but heavily uses elements introduced in book 4 (particularly Paul and his knowledge).  How far will this series go?	2005-03-10

It is the ghost of Jesse's fiance.  She want's Suze to stop the construction of a hot tub that requires a lot of digging in Suze's back yard. <br /> <br />But Maria's ghost is not all Suze has to worry about.  Diego's ghost is also here.  And what will happen to Jesse if it turns out his remains are buried, and found in the back yard?  Will he pass on for good and leave Suze?  And what about Suze's summer job where she may have located another mediator?  May she have also located a deadly enemy? <br /> <br />This is the odd book in the series.  It really reads as if someone else wrote it.  Many details are simply wrong.  Suze's home life is quite different.  Her father no longer seems to be a cook and there is no importance to having family meals.  Suze misses many meals without repercussions and the one we do see is a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Also, back at the school it is twice mentioned what Suze was told about a statue that might weep blood.  Unfortunately the references do not match what she was actually told in the first book.  Then we have Maria and Diego.  It seems they passed on but came back when the digging began.  I didn't think ghosts could come back after they crossed.  One final point.  I don't know if this is a revelation for later, but there is a little detail about what ghosts are buried in and references to spurs.  I don't know if this was a mistake or if it foreshadows something later (at least not through book 5 where the idea of a mistake is somewhat supported). <br /> <br />I really did not like this one as much as the earlier books.  Too much was changed and it really felt like it was written by someone who did not remember the earlier books.  Unfortunately there are many details that follow through to later books so you can't just skip it (just don't let it stop you from reading the series as it returns to normal in book 5).	2005-03-10

In the second book there was a teaser about the purpose of the Nightside.  Now in the fourth book we return to these themes in a big way.  Lady Luck has hired John to find out the origins of the Nightside.  As payment she will tell him about his mother. <br /> <br />As John starts his quest, he teams up with some very interesting characters (not Susie this time).  As he looks for answers we get to see more of the Nightside and how it can affect others on all levels.  All the while John wonders about the possible future he saw and how he can prevent it.  In the end we have plenty of revelations and John is even more determined to make sure the bleak future he saw will not come to pass. <br /> <br />I felt the third book in the series was a little weak but this one does not suffer from that problem.  This is probably the strongest book in the series and my favorite after the first.  Suffice it to say, you do not want John on your bad side.	2005-03-04

Possible electromagnetic emanations affect the local wildlife.  It may also be affecting the granddaughter of their innkeeper.  Clearly something is going on and getting close to a climax.  The charmed ones look into the local history and that of the granddaughter to try and uncover the mysteries. <br /> <br />Who is the innocent they are to protect?  Is it the granddaughter, the innkeeper, the entire town?  That is left for the Charmed ones to puzzle out before it becomes too late.  One of the better Charmed books so far.	2005-03-04

Suze Simon, mediator to the dead, is confronted by a screaming ghost in her room one night.  Suze needs to get a message to \\"Red\\" in order to satisfy the screaming specter. <br /> <br />But delivering messages for the dead is not usually an easy task.  Recipients may not believe you or they may think you are crazy.  But this time Suze runs into someone who may be crazy and very dangerous.  This time she might be in over her head. <br /> <br />Once again we get a fast-paced story as Suze tries to balance her unwanted role of mediator with her life as a teenager.  Add a possible new boyfriend, her new family, and a case of poison oak and Suze really has her hands full even without being a mediator.  But Suze manages to weather it all in her own way, and sometimes with a little help.  Another fun book.	2005-03-04

This would be hard enough if it wasn't for the fact that Suze sees dead people. <br /> <br />Suze is a mediator.  That means she is able to see and interact with ghosts.  These are people with some unfinished business.  As a mediator she is to help them cross over.  She came upon this talent at the age of two and has had a hard time dealing with it.  Her personal record has been far from spotless as she tries to be a mediator and not look insane to the rest of the world. <br /> <br />Now in her new home with her new family, Suze has new challenges.  One is a 150-year-old ghost named Jessie that lives in her bedroom.  The other is a new ghost at her new school.  This one is very angry and bent on destruction and mayhem.  Suze must protect the lives of others, the lives of herself and her family, and try not to look completely crazy in her first days at school.  But Suze manages to get some help from two unexpected sources. <br /> <br />A pretty good story.  I would like to know more of Suze's pre-Californian adventures but there are only vague hints.  What we do get is a fast and wild story that is sort of a cross between Fearless and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  A good read.	2005-03-04

He has seen the dark that inhabits our world.  His best friend is a ghoul.  But still, most of the world refuses to believe in the creatures that walk among them.  Now Cal has been called by an old cop buddy to look into some very strange happenings.  Bodies are starting to turn up.  Bodies where the brain is completely missing with no signs as to how they were removed. <br /> <br />The case reminds Cal of an old case that should be closed.  Could something similar be happening again all these years later?  The search for the answers will take Cal to the scene of the previous case and ultimately to the sewers and other tunnels under the city.  There he will have his final confrontation with this new horror. <br /> <br />Cal McDonald is an interesting character.  He is rare in that he believes the evidence of his own senses.  At the start of the book the tone is similar to a classic hard-boiled detective tale but it quickly develops its own flavor and style.  I had fun reading this one and look forward to the next one.	2005-03-04

In this novelization, we find a shady scientist in a shady corporation working with prehistoric crocodile DNA in hopes of creating human regeneration.  What he gets is a big hungry beastie that escapes into the swamps of Florida. <br /> <br />With a big hungry croc-monster on the loose what can one expect but the enlistment of an Australian crocodile hunter to help bring the beast down.  Never mind that it's not really a croc and that it is a big as anything that ever stalked the dinosaurs. <br /> <br />Although a novelization, the action comes off well in printed form and really makes me want to see the movie.  The characters are pretty standard but there are some clever twists as well as some old ones.  The real problem with the story lies in the way the whole thing is kept local.  Despite wide news coverage of events it still is all handled by local law-enforcement.  No Nation Guard, no state troopers, no nothing.  But still, if you want giant man-eating monsters, this one will fit the bill.	2005-03-03

Some are disturbing, some are unsettling, and some are just plain spooky.  There is also a little science fiction included (although just as dark as the others). <br /> <br />If you like a good collection of tales to cause shivers, you can certainly do far worse than this collection of zombies, psychopaths, invaders, and things that go slash in the night.	2005-03-03

We have the head of that family giving tin soldiers to boys who later die.  We have hidden mysteries whose time for revelation has come. <br /> <br />But mostly we have a young boy whose best friend died in an alleged accident.  Now he has been given a tin soldier.

Withing a week of being a Newbie and the scorn of the school, she gets wrapped up in a rash of missing students.  This gets tied into the rivalry between the Schoolies and the Townies.  Very quickly she is catapulted into a growing horror complete with sacrifices, the occult and horrible monsters. <br /> <br />Mr. Moore usually is a pretty good writer but I am not sure what happened here.  Ignoring all of the references to a previous book, there is still plenty of bad writing.  Most is in the form of inconsistencies in descriptions.  For example, there is a wooden platform in the story.  It is first described as, \\"It was a sturdy structure but not much to look at.\\"  A few minutes later in the plot it is described as, \\"and the platform was rickety to begin with.\\"  I'm not really sure what the author was thinking or if it is an editorial mistake. <br /> <br />Despite its obvious flaws this is still an entertaining book (if annoying) even if you haven't read Possessions.  The action is fast and the plot moves quickly.  Fun it is but literature it ain't.	2005-02-16

As a special collection cataloger for the New York Public Library she has written the book portion of this set (software, book, and binder).    Book cataloging software is an iffy proposition.  My current collection (20,000+ volumes not counting 1,000+ of graphic novels) is on a computerized database.  I tried many off-the shelf products and they all fail in one major aspect or another.  Do you want to know what stories are in a particular collection?  Do you want to know that the book crosses several genres? (a big thing in romances these days)  Do you want ISBNs? searches capable of looking for primary, secondary, tertiary, etc. authors?  M. Ahrens suggests software that adds data based on ISBN.  But what about all of those books published before the ISBN became a standard in 1970? Value?  Edition?  Typeface?  Binding?  A collector is better off thinking about what they want to track in their collection and using a simple database program (Paradox, Access, etc.) or a configurable home inventory program.    The binder is designed for printing out a copy of your book inventory (mine changes several times a week thus making a paper record short-lived and wasteful).  It is a nice addition for a complete collection (say a complete collection of first editions of a favorite author) but inadequate for any active collection.    The book is interesting but seems to apply to a perfect world.  If you add to your collection, the idea of shelf numbering may not be something you want to have to keep updating in the database as books move from one shelf to another.  Calculating shelf space needed is usually pretty straight forward (but always add at least 30% if you don't want to spend more time moving books than reading them.    Of course there are nuggets that cataloging novices may not have thought of and the price is not prohibitive but if you are looking for that final solution to your personal library, this is really just a signpost that can point you into better directions.	2005-02-14

Seen as an omen, they are not marooned.  Instead, the streak turns out to be the craft of infant Kal-El who is then raised by the giant apes. <br /> <br />Time goes by and Argo-Zan (Kal-El) learns he is from Krypton but always assumes all humans are Kryptonian.  John Clayton mopes around England feeling as if he is out of place and missing something. <br /> <br />Clayton funds an expedition looking for signs of Romans in East Africa.  Along on the expedition are American reporter Lois Lane and her assistant Jane Porter. <br /> <br />Well, the two groups do come together rather quickly as well as some other Burroughs favorites.  Clayton proves himself to be the man of action his father always wanted and Lois finds a man who likes his steaks rare. <br /> <br />Not a bad blending of the two heroes (similar to Superman Batman Speeding Bullets) but Burroughs fans will be disappointed.  Yes, there are Burroughs elements but not style.  There are no cliffhangers or setbacks or unrequited love that made the original serials so popular.  Instead, all the characters come together and suddenly everything is solved. <br /> <br />The art style is rather cartoonish.  Think of the cook from Disney's Atlantis and you will get an idea of what to expect.  I have seen worse art and this does not really detract from the story. <br /> <br />All in all a brief bit of fun but it needed to be filled out better to make the crossover more believable.	2005-02-08

G. Wells classic.  It just doesn't work well. <br /> <br />In this tale, Moreau has his creatures.  They have been created from various animals and roughly parallel the JLA with Diana the white ape being the only one with a similar name.  Superman has been replaced with a silent Komodo Dragon, for example (there is no Batman equivalent). <br /> <br />Eventually after retelling much of the Well tale, the group return to London.  After being scoffed at Moreau sets his Justifiers of Law to find Jack the Ripper, a slight diversion before the Wells tale resurfaces for the ending. <br /> <br />JLA fans may like individual characters but most seem to read for the team effort and interaction of the characters.  This is almost completely lacking in the Elseworlds tale.  Here we have neither the heroes nor the interactions that make JLA stories popular.  Basically this one is a swing and a miss.	2005-02-08

The goal is a Nazi submarine packed to the gills with stolen gold.  The search has the crew in the middle of the Sargasso Sea in the Bermuda Triangle. <br /> <br />Things begin to go from bad to worse.  A ninety-foot barge goes missing in eighty-feet of water.  Two divers and necessary equipment went missing with it.  Then things start breaking and people start dying.  Is it the Triangle at work?  Or is it giant megalodon sharks and giant manta rays?  There seems evidence for both. <br /> <br />But Elliot manages to wade through all of the troubles and setbacks and put the puzzle pieces together.  Action, intrigue, and danger flow quickly as things spiral toward disaster.  Can Wages save the day and save the apparently doomed expedition?  You will have to read to find out. <br /> <br />This was an entertaining book with a nice mix of human and natural danger.  I really liked the character of Elliot Wages and wish that we might see more of him in other books although plot-wise that is not very likely.  Still, it was a very enjoyable bit of escapist reading.	2005-02-07

Julie Hutchinson's world takes a nosedive when she is informed that her husband has been murdered.  As she tries to deal with the horrific event, she slowly comes to realize that there are many parts of her husband's past that have been kept secret from her. <br /> <br />Julie tries to uncover the truth of her husband's past.  While doing so she begins having erotic dreams about him.  Her daughter thinks she can talk to him.  Her mother puts her in contact with a TV psychic.  She contacts her husband's ex who is in an asylum.  Eventually she begins to doubt reality.  The whole story culminates in a dramatic conclusion that can give readers shivers. <br /> <br />This is a very interesting although a little slow to build at first.  The histories of psychic studies, open and covert, tie into Julie's dilemmas.  It was refreshing to find an ending that was not obvious right from the start.  A fine book from a talented author (although a little shorter than previous works).	2005-01-31

When I noticed that this one would be a timely read what with the recent landing on Titan, I decided to read it right away. <br /> <br />Earth is in trouble.  Populations went into a sudden decline as new diseases began popping up.  Science was good at identifying the diseases but where behind in the actual cures.  An expendable team of not-really experts is sent to Titan to study the pre-biotic environment in hopes of filling in some of the gaps in scientific knowledge regarding the formation and evolution of life. <br /> <br />The book starts with two principles for scientific study and a cast of the characters.  The first principle is violated almost every time anyone talks.  As for the characters, there is little to distinguish them.  They remind me of some Victorian literature where characters are merely referred to by their title as that would be the only way to distinguish them.  Unfortunately there is no such trick here to make distinctions. <br /> <br />As the book progresses, the reader is mired in dull plots, little action, and non-characters.  There is little reason to want anyone to succeed and as the end of the book approaches, one wonders how it could end in such a short space. <br /> <br />That is another problem.  After an entire book of almost nothing, real science is thrown out the window so that a rabbit can be pulled out of a hat for an ending. <br /> <br />As mentioned, I am a big fan of Hal Clement and I really like hard-science novels but this is one that should stay on the shelves and maybe everyone will forget to attribute it to a master like Clement.	2005-01-25

A team of scientists were working on the idea thirty years ago.  All was going well until they were finally ready to test the process on a human subject.  The subject died and the project, named Hermes, was shutdown and abandoned.  The scientists disbanded and refused to ever mention the project again. <br /> <br />But a young lab technician saw possibilities and stole the research notes.  After spending his life, health and fortune of the project, now named Thoth, he has invited to original team to his island estate where he plans to reveal the truth of the project and how it really works. <br /> <br />One of the scientists has died and her daughter arrives in her place.  Soon the scientist realize who their host is and what he has done.  They are very afraid.  That is when the true horror begins.  Butcher teleports himself but an accident leaves him in between.  A place and state that alows him to exact vengeance on the others. <br /> <br />Now it is a race against time to understand what is going on and to stay alive and maybe, just maybe, put and end to the horror. <br /> <br />A fast moving tale deeply rooted in Egyptian mythology (hence the name Thoth).  Mythology and quantum physics colide in a believable manner that helps keep the creepiness of the horror at a peak.  The ending was believable and not a disappointment.  It should prove an entertaining read for anyone who enjoys a mix of science and sorcery.	2005-01-21

These stories read more like the books Rick wrote between the two I mentioned.  In other words they deal mostly with atmosphere, feelings, and creepiness and not horrible monsters. <br /> <br />I knew his monster books were not the norm for him but I decided to try the collection anyway.  I was not disappointed.  I would have liked to know when each story was written (there were no separate copyrights) so I could place them in his career but that did not really detract. <br /> <br />Some of the stories have appeared in theme collections and you will probably recognize those themes.  There are also a number of stories offered as tributes to other authors.  One of my favorites was Crying Wolf that was written in the style of horror great Richard Laymon (Hautula really nailed that one). <br /> <br />Readers have to remember that this is a collection spanning the years of a writers career.  That means that writing styles will differ, themes will vary greatly, and quality will have hopefully improved over the years.  Taking that into account, one is not surprised by anything in this collection.  Ghosts, werewolves, monsters, desolation, devils, psychopaths and dementia are the fare within.  If you want ravening monsters, stick with Little Brothers and The Mountain King, otherwise you should enjoy this offering.	2005-01-19

Now that she is human again, she is once again behind the wheel of a fast car with her Djinn partner David. <br /> <br />At the end of the last book a nasty teen wound up in control of the most powerful Djinn of all.  They are now in Vegas and Joanna has been unable to get there even though she and David have been trying for two weeks. <br /> <br />With success no closer and danger piling up, the Wardens pull Joanna back and decide to make a move.  Anyone who has read the previous books know that Joanna does not like being pushed around. <br /> <br />As the tension and danger mount, we meet new characters as well as old.  Like with the previous books we learn that there is more to the world than we know, or Joanna knows.  While the book does not end on as big a cliffhanger as the last one, there are enough unresolved issues hanging around that a fourth book is desperately desired. <br /> <br />If you like fast cars, tough women, and a bit a magic, this is a book for you.	2005-01-12

Although recommended for grades 1-3, my preschooler absolutely loves this book. <br /> <br />My daughter will shyly ask me to read to her and then she will pull this book out from behind her back.  It is her current favorite. <br /> <br />My daughter seems to really enjoy books about real people (Laura Engels, Balto, etc.).  She particularly likes Sacajawea's son Pomp (he always gets to ride). <br /> <br />She has no trouble with words or names (there are pronunciation guides for Native American names) and she has a very good grasp of the story. <br /> <br />As this is intended for young readers, the story is rather short and simple but gives a good broad look at the whole story.  As an adult who has had to read this book dozens of times I also find it enjoyable.	2005-01-12

Mr. Brown's writing style has also hit its stride as he has reinvented the pulp.<br /><br />Robert Langdon is back (see Angels & Demons).  But this time he is not hired to solve anything.  But he is asked to look at a crime scene in the hopes that he will incriminate himself.  From that point he is a fugitive for most of the book, thus adding the sense of urgency usually present in Dan Brown's books.<br /><br />The main story concerns a secret society known as the Priory of Scion which is rumored to have a collection of evidence that proves the Roman Catholic Church has been lying since the beginning.  Langdon manages to escape at the beginning with the help of a cryptographer who happens to be related to the murder victim.<br /><br />The rest of the book moves at a furious pace using classic pulp techniques of cliff hangers and withholding revelations to the reader.  The questions are not all answered until literally the final page (although you may guess many of them).<br /><br />Readers need to remember that this is a work of fiction and that many of the \\"facts\\" are untrue.  Some are but there is much that is not.  Many books have since been published that point these out in detail.  Two examples I will cite, Langdon claims the Church has wiped out all references linking the goddess Venus with physical love, a lone exception being the term venereal disease.  What about that anatomy every junior high student learns about called the venus mons or mound of venus?  At another point Langdon talks about how there is so much rumor about the Knights Templar that finding the truth is impossible.  In the same breath he gives a very detailed history of their formation, actions, fall, and escape.<br /><br />Many readers will not care about such details.  Those that do should just remember that this is a work of fiction.  Ultimately both should be able to enjoy this fast-paced adventure.  Truly entertaining.this fast-paced adventure.

Because teleporters don't seem to work with adults, teenagers are the ones yanked to the future. <br /> <br />This first volume has two teens from 1999 yanked to the future to join two others from even further in the past.  Their mission, if they accept it, is to teleport to a lost colony and find a secret hidden there by a dying ship's captain.  Another alien race also seems to know about the secret and are sending their own people. <br /> <br />The secret concerns one of the steps humanity must take before the Givers will convey even more powerful secrets and abilities.  It would not be good for the more belligerent aliens to gain the secret first. <br /> <br />A pretty good start to this series with some nice explanations for the story's framework.  Interesting aliens and an important deadline add to the mix and make the book move fairly quickly.  A very pleasing read that helps recapture some of the wonder of early science fiction.	2005-01-04

Little-known and/or questionable legislation has been passed and black budgets have been funded. <br /> <br />When a cable science show receives a photo showing the Cydonia region of Mars (the Face and the Pyramid).  Coding makes the picture look like it originated from a lost NASA Mars probe.  What does it mean?  Meanwhile the new President is being pressured to give the go ahead for the Orion Project that will initiate a space-based laser defense system that actually works.  Why is he being pressured? <br /> <br />Both of the events lead characters to delve into just what is going on.  From the 1958 Brookings report co written by Margaret Mead that recommends hiding all evidence of alien intelligence, to the NASA director's ability to quarantine anyone supposedly exposed to dangerous substances, to modern black budget projects and the new leaser defense system.  Ultimately the two quests come together and the truth is discovered. <br /> <br />Like others, I was curious about some of the goings on in the book that seemed unrelated to the main story.  Were they included just to show that not everything is Orion related?  Or were they included as teaser threads to lead into sequels?  Could this be like Robert Doherty's Area 51 series that began with a novel of suspense and coverups that was followed aby books dealing with what was uncovered in the first?  We'll wait and see. <br /> <br />My main problem with the book was one of identity.  There is so much factual and verifiable information in this book that the fantastic seems more plausible.  Many historic and public figures are mentioned.  But the crew of the final Apollo mission is completely changed.  I think the story could have been accomplished without changing these identities by only making a few changes to the plot.  Having met members of the mission Ifelt particularly strongly about this.  Others probably won't. <br /> <br />This was quite a well researched and plotted book and hope the author will follow it up with others.  Fans of books like Area 51 or The DaVinci Code will probably enjoy the way history is uncovered and revealed.	2005-01-04

Because teleporters don't seem to work with adults, teenagers are the ones yanked to the future. <br /> <br />This second volume has two teens yanked from 1999 although only one was targeted.  The other got caught up in the ride.  They are joined by a young hand from Sir Francis Drake's ship and a future teen.  A research station in the Oort Cloud, the place where comets come from, is slowly being overrun by aliens.  They are small, round, furry, enticing and, when in groups, can disrupt electrical systems.  The teens must find a way to eliminate the aliens before their interfering disrupts a critical system like life support. <br /> <br />The resemblance of the aliens to the popular Star Trek Tribbles (and Heinlein's originals) is unmistakable.  The teens try to stop the aliens as well as learn about them.  Stopping them is not so easy when the locals can't seem to bring themselves to harm them.  Many schemes are tried until a resolution is reached at the end. <br /> <br />This was a good second volume but some of the framework contradicted the framework of the first book which leads me to believe that the outline for the series was not as rigid or as well-defined as I though.

The first meeting will be very important and lead to a second closer to Earth.  A third race will be acting as hosts and mediators.  Each side will have eight delegates.  The humans have decided to add three teens with grit to their party.  Their main goal will be to find out if the aliens have any knowledge of a lost colony that may have survived from the ship Roanoke. <br /> <br />This story takes a long time to really get going.  The mission begins about midway through the book.  The framework moves even further away from the first book which leads me to believe that series setting was only very loosely worked out.

But one day as he and his sister are attacked by thugs, they are rescued by a mysterious super-warrior from Isurugi temple.  He claims to be their bodyguard. <br /> <br />Then Mao discovers that his father has returned.  He is an emaciated shell of his former self.  He apparently went looking for a powerful artifact called the Arm of Senju Kannon, which he found and became possessed by.  Now he wants to share it with his son.  Mao makes some disturbing discoveries and is soon abducted by a secret research facility. <br /> <br />At the facility, they have been working on turning men into monsters using the unused DNA hidden away in everyone, especially the reptile DNA.  They are very interested in Mao, the Arm and how it may have effected them. <br /> <br />This first volume is the only one so far without a parental warning and, oddly, has the most explicit scenes in the series so far.  Although the series is called \\"The Arm of Kannon\\", the artifact is always referred to as the Arm of Senju Kannon.  I have read the first several volumes and unlike other reviewers seen no similarity to \\"Overfiend\\" although the story of a weapon (sword, gauntlet, knife, etc.) that possesses its user is not new, this book pulls out most of the stops.

But what really led to the war between New Genesis and Apokolips?  Why was a boom tube being opened to Earth in the first place?  Well, this sequel offers us a chance to see what else was going on. <br /> <br />With a little more involvement from Darkseid and company, we learn about some of Darkseid's long-term goals and how Earth is involved in them.  But as with the Generations books, Another Nail takes the opportunity to bring in as much of the DC universe as possible.  Just about everyone gets involved in this one.  We even see Jonah Hex and OMAC.  Unlike with many sequels, this one manages to be almost as good as the original. <br /> <br />True to the Elseworlds idea, characters may get used up or sent in radically different directions.  Like with the OMAC mini-series, I am not sure that Jack Kirby would completely approve of what happens to some of his characters but if he understood Elseworlds I think he would approve of the grandness of this story's scale. <br /> <br />While there is a decent rehash of the original The Nail at the start, I would not recommend reading this one without reading The Nail first.	2004-12-21

All of the questions and others get answered although some of those answers raise more questions as well as pave the way for the sequel. <br /> <br />Quick short chapters move the story along very quickly and the reader is kept guessing what is really going on.  As the book ended I was sorry I had not waited to get the sequel first (my usual habit).  Now I have to wait for the next one.  Storywise this one seems to fall somewhere between Stine's usual YA books and his more adult stories.  This is not a typical vampire tale.	2004-12-21

This three-part story looks at the Justice League of America in a world where the Kents did not go out one day due to a nail in a tire and stayed home to fool around.  That means they would not find the infant Kal-El after he crashes to Earth. <br /> <br />Back in the present, we see a world where heroes are not as popular as in the regular comics.  Many are not trusted and there is even a lot of bickering between them.  Much of the DC universe is present and we see many familiar faces in new or unusual places.  At this time it seems a new menace is facing the Earth.  Some suspect some of what is going on but no one really knows what is up.  Green Lantern makes a startling discovery but the rest of the Corps is busy with the New Gods. <br /> <br />Eventually we see how everything is pulled together and just who is behind all of the trouble.  We eventually learn what happened to Kal-El and where he has been all of this time (pretty believable). <br /> <br />As this is an Elseworlds tale, the writer does not need to pull punches.  Characters can die or get taken out of the picture in one of these tales so do not be surprised by some of the developments. <br /> <br />While I really enjoyed the story I was not convinced that this was a \\"What If\\" type story.  If this really was the straight DC universe with a small variation, many of the characters would be dead because Superman did not save them (ala It's A Wonderful Life).  I am also not convinced that people would have followed the career paths they did.  But if you look at it like a true Elseworlds tale where anything can change, this one can knock your socks off.	2004-12-21

It seems like the investigation has just started when the unusual FBI agent steps off a bus and begins poking around. <br /> <br />Pendergast uses his unique style of investigation to get involved in the investigation as well as tick off quite a few locals.  But then he tells the local paper that he believes the murderer is local and the town is up in arms. <br /> <br />But soon a second body turns up and it looks like Pendergast just might be right no matter what the town wants to think.  Eventually Pendergast and the local Sheriff are each on their own path hunting the killer. <br /> <br />A wonderful read that really kept me going.  All of the little details were very well worked out and I especially liked all of the little follow-ups to the previous book (Cabinet of Curiosities).  I was strung along trying to solve everything before it was revealed but when the final blow fell right at the end I was unprepared (you'll have to read it to see what I mean).	2004-12-21

Now she is a private investigator.  She has just been offered a case that could help her financially and get her practice firmly in the black.  The job is for the FSA and involves looking for a missing person. <br /> <br />Shelby follows the leads and does some undercover work which eventually leads her to a medical facility that might be holding the object of her search.  But why is she really on the case?  What is really going on in the facility?  Is she being played by the government?  All of these and other questions are answered. <br /> <br />The plot is pretty good but nowhere near as dark as the back of the book makes it out to be.  The end involves an unsupported revelation (usually taboo in mystery and suspense novels) but does offer a continuing thread for Wolfe's next book, Natural Selection.  Shelby left the FSA at some point but the narrative gives differing time frames as to when it happened (I felt that was clumsy).  I found no real suspense and the plot really was pretty mild.  Shelby does not rally come off as the competent agent she is supposed to have been, more like someone playing at being an agent based on what they have seen on TV. <br /> <br />All in all I would not really recommend this book.  It seems to have been at least one draft shy of being ready and the plot seems to have been set up to make as many characters female as possible (not really a bad thing but it seems forced here).  Maybe her next book will be more finished but I don't think I will check it out.	2004-12-20

Blake was in a bus accident when he was very young and was the only survivor.  Although he has no memory of how he managed to survive the event has drastically shaped his personality. <br /> <br />At a carnival Blake is approached by a beautiful woman and given a pass to a special carnival. But Quinn steals the pass and winds up in serious trouble as the other carnival is no mere collection of amusements.  There you must survive the rides or become part of the carnival. <br /> <br />With Quinn stuck in the carnival, Blake and a couple of friends set out to rescue the young daredevil.  The journey leads to a lot of soul searching on Blake's part and he finds himself confronting the devils of the carnival as well as those inside him. <br /> <br />A very interesting read that really takes you into he mind of the main character.  How events, past and present, are woven together shows Shusterman's true skills as a writer.  A very entertaining and thoughtful read.	2004-12-20

One-thousand unique agents doesn't seem like it could be terribly effective but it seems that the right agent is always close at hand.  There is very little repetition of character (mostly just Miranda Zero and Aleph) but you may spot a cameo or two.  Each story is also drawn by a different artist thus weakening the feeling of continuity. <br /> <br />The threats in this volume include a man who is a walking nuclear bomb, a rogue bionic man, a memetic invasion, a cult hostage situation, a town that may have seen an angel, and bioterrorists using ebola.  Very interesting stories but I am not sure why the Frequency was needed for the hostage story. <br />	2004-12-15

The dialogue is similar to the originals but not really true to form.  Unlike the original Dick and Jane tales the definitions are not readily obvious.  There is a glossary at the back but once you get back and forth, the joke may not be so funny. <br /> <br />Loaded with more adult terms and situations this is not a book for children (as we found out when my five-year-old received a copy). <br /> <br />If you already have a handle on some common Yiddish, you might get a chuckle out of this one.	2004-12-13

As such, the reader needs to be aware of what to attribute to the scriptwriter and what to the novelization author.  Sometimes the novelization author can improve of what is in the screenplay.  Unfortunately, this time both are bad. <br /> <br />An ancient organization known as The Library has been safeguarding powerful relics that humanity is not ready for.  A rival ancient order wants the items for their own bid for power.  Flynn Carson is a professional student who finds himself needing a job.  He is offered the position of The Librarian, the guardian of The Library. <br /> <br />Flynn starts his new job only to be thrust into a quest to find the hidden pieces of the Spear of Destiny.  The trip takes him around the world and wins him the love and sexual favors of a beautiful Library employee. <br /> <br />Now lets look at what might be wrong with the original story. <br /> <br />Our characters are on a commercial international flight.  The pilots have been entertaining someone in the cockpit.  Both pilots escort their guest back to their seat.  All of this occurs on a flight in a reality that includes an Air Marshall on board. <br /> <br />On an international flight, the door is opened and several characters jump out.  Apparently everyone was wearing their seatbelts as no one else fell out.  The jumpers did not use any method to breathe in the rarified atmosphere. <br /> <br />The super-genius thinks his cell phone will work in the Amazon.  We then have a cell phone receive a call in the Amazon (maybe phone rates are so high because they have been spending money to put transmitting towers al through the Amazon). <br /> <br />An ancient riddle written in a language that predates the Tower of Babel has an answer in English. <br /> <br />A holy Christian relic can only be repaired though a Pagan ritual that calls on the Old Gods (let's ask Jesus about that one). <br /> <br />Although the show seems to be pushed as a family show, it is important to the plot that the hero has sex with someone he only met a couple of days earlier (let's hear it for family values). <br /> <br />The list goes on and on.  But what about the book author?  Well, right at the beginning we are given a taste of what to expect during the course of the book.  Flynn is escorted through an \\"empty hallway\\" and then we get a description of all of the things in the hallway.  Is it empty or not? <br /> <br />The adventure angle and the popular cast will, I am sure, get good ratings at first, but as for the novelization, it should remain in the slush pile.	2004-12-13

The story reads like Damnation Alley with a twist. <br /> <br />Trennt is a courier.  He carries sensitive material through the increasingly hostile country.  On his last mission we never know if he succeeds with the delivery, only that he escapes with his life. <br /> <br />Now he has been hired, along with an on-again off-again partner, to shut down a secret research facility and bring back the research and staff.  Nothing goes right with the mission, partly due to forces bent on destroying all evidence of the facility and its work.  Soon Trennt is in the hostile wastelands where just about everything can kill you.  He is still trying to complete some small part of his mission. <br /> <br />In the end I was quite unsatisfied (why didn't he at least check out the empty plane?).  At first the wilderness is super-deadly but at the end it just takes a little mud to survive.  Characters' motivations are spotting and often don't make sense.  The non-romantic romance was seemingly just thrown in but might have been the main point.  I will probably not even look at any new books from this author unless the style changes greatly.	2004-12-07

Courtney Crumrin is back in this third story.  This time Courtney really needs to watch her back as someone is out to get her and put an end to her ways.  At the end of the last story, Courtney doled out some justice to the summoner of Rawhead Rex.  Now she has a lot of new challenges. <br /> <br />Chapter 1: Courtney visits her old neighborhood while her parents try vainly to sell their old condo.  Courtney's old associations are strained but her new talents come in handy to help an old friend. <br /> <br />Chapters 2-4: Courtney is enrolled in Saturday school where she learns more about the community in which she lives.  But one of the other kids is a show off and turns his brother into a night thing despite Courtney's warnings.  When the spell cannot be reversed, Courtney is enlisted to help.  She discovers that there is a way to lift the curse but it involves a dangerous visit to the Twilight King.  To make matters worse, the deputy seems to have uncovered COURTNEY's involvement of the last story and is trying to stop her. <br /> <br />A wonderful story.  We see some hints of how the community has come to be and the Crumrin involvement.  Uncle Aloysius is seen a little less but he is there where needed.  The teaser at the end leaves plenty of possibilities for the next story.	2004-12-07

Ellis takes it a little further and has the whole manned program shut down completely.    The time is the near future and the manned space program has been completely shut down since a shuttle just disappeared ten years earlier.  But suddenly the shuttle returns to Kennedy.    The return of the shuttle sets off a cavalcade of action as teams are quickly assembled to discover just what happened and what it means.  One team is checking out the shuttle and how it is operating.  One is checking out where it has been.  The third team is looking into the one crew member to return; the pilot.  This will not be easy as the shuttle seems to be covered in skin, the pilot is near catatonic, and there is evidence that it landed on Mars.    This is a story of a world where the doors to space travel ravel and exploration have been closed.  Now a new enthusiasm is sparked and the reader is taken on a wonderful ride of discovery as the teams delve into the possibilities.  Ellis handles the techno-jargon (it's not babble) very well.  The excitement the engineer feels as research progresses is almost tangible.  He races through ideas an possibilities in a very believable manner.  The other team's actions follow similarly-believable lines.  In the end the reader is left with one simple thought: I want more!	2004-12-07

What it actually is is a self-serving justification for the Youngblood universe and all of its little spinoffs.    Knightsabre comes home drunk on his 30th birthday.  He passes out and wakes up accused of murdering Riptide.  The story moves between the main plot and short stories of spinoffs throughout the ages.  As the story moves to an unlikely trial (held in private) we find that the whole event is a result of the entire universe.  Every character since the dawn of time has had some hand in this story.    This story was supposed to show how a superhero faces trial using non-super courts and legal systems.  But they pick their own judge and hold the trial in secret.  Secret from the non-super world, that is.  In the end it just shows how cleverly Alan Moore can tie seemingly unrelated elements into a story.  The story ends with the third part of the four-part story.  Part four is reserved for a series of short Youngblood prequel stories (why not just make it a three-parter?).    If you want to see Moore being clever, you might like this one.  If you are looking for the advertised drama, stay away because it isn't here.	2004-12-06

First Buffy ran away to Las Vegas but then returned to be committed.  Now she has to face the divorce of her parents. <br /> <br />Angelus and Whisper enter the scene and Angelus wants to end Buffy's pain by casting a complex spell.  Unfortunately it results in the release of the Malignancy Demons that feed off of Buffy's negative emotions. <br /> <br />First Buffy must deal with Deceit but Guilt, Abandonment and Trepidation follow.  Angelus tries to help with another spell and the demons get drawn to Sunnydale.  Also in Sunnydale is newly arrived Rupert Giles who braces himself for sunshine and a slayer named Buffy. <br /> <br />Overall I felt this was the weakest of the three stories but it does tell the tale of the move from LA to Sunnydale.  The story is very angst-ridden and metaphysical with animal scenes acting out the demons but then becoming a place Buffy can journey to (you'll have to read it to know what that means). <br /> <br />I recommend this one only because it completes the transition from LA to Sunnydale.  It also sets up a few characters and situations t be seen on Buffy and Angel.	2004-12-06

The subject matter is all over the place with novel excerpts, stories, essays, logs, e-mails, and notes. <br /> <br />Unfortunately for Niven fans, this collection came out late enough that they will probably have all of the novels excerpted here.  But there are also tales of Gil Hamilton, Beowulf Shaefer, and Draco's Tavern.  We are also treated to communications between Mr. Niven and collaborators and editors that helps to show how ideas come to fruition. <br /> <br />Mr. Niven also talks about how his mind works.  Sort of a slower da Vinci, Niven spawns ideas and pushes them to their conclusions in almost frightening ways.  He calls himself scatterbrained but really he can just see the path of an idea and where it leads (i.e. heat exchangers on Pluto). <br /> <br />The other drawback to the collection is it seems too short.  It isn't, but it seems that way.  If you have already read the novels excerpted, the rest seems to fly by just a little too quickly.  Of course most of the reason is that it reads well and thus faster.  Still, I can't help but feel it will be too long before I get another crack at a fresh collection from one of my favorite authors.	2004-12-01

Ages ago a creature known as STONe rose up and devoured six continents.  Now the world is covered by a sand sea (like quicksand but thinner and more fluid).  In this setting we meet the pink-haired witch Zizi. <br /> <br />Zizi has an ability to see through the sea.  She also does not know where she came from.  She currently lives with a whaling community that inhabits an island (a sunken/mired ship).  She meets some pirates and her adventures really begin.  She pits herself against the pirates, devourers, leviathans, and anyone who stands in her way.  Including a mysterious Empire that shows up near the end of the volume. <br /> <br />Zizi is pre-pubescent and just on the edge of becoming a woman.  Her insides feel wrong and she is about to undergo the rite of the Red Tide (menstruation).  But it is at this time that she becomes banished from the island due to her actions and takes up with the pirates. <br /> <br />The art in this story is very crude and inconsistent.  It could easily have been drawn by more than one artist.  Many pages and frames look more like concept sketches than a finished product.  At one point Zizi is riding a whale but in the next panel it is a devourer (what gives?).  There is no real story, the characters are very non-dimensional, the art is crude.  I do not recommend this one, but since it has been collected there must be some readers who enjoy it.	2004-11-30

One day she goes to visit a relative on the other side.  She will climb up with her dog and then ski down the other side.  But on the way up she runs into the trolls.  Each troll she meets is interested in her dog.  Treva manages to trick each of them into taking some of her clothing instead (mittens, hat, sweater, boots).  But just at the top the trolls decide they still want the dog.  Treva has one more trick up her sleeve and winds up same with her dog and all of her clothing.  The ultimate fate of the trolls is quite interesting. <br /> <br />This is a very nice story with an intelligent and quick-thinking protagonist.  Troll legend has been change a little.  There is no mention of the trolls wanting to eat the dog (a la Billy Goats Gruff) but instead to help warm them and act as a pack animal.  Their fate is also one I am unfamiliar with.  Many stories have trolls turn to stone in the sunlight but this transformation is quite interesting. <br /> <br />The illustrations are just what you expect from Jan Brett; beautiful and packed with detail.  Earrings and hair ribbons should be paid attention to as well as the happy hedgehog who invades the trolls' home.  A truly delightful story from an author who has written more stories about clothes than you can imagine (The Hat, The Mitten, Armadillo Rodeo, Etc).	2004-11-24
448722:US	38672733	R2UMJI8CALAY06	0743497627	386215182	The Playgroup: A Novel of Terrifying Suspense	Books	1	2	4	N	N	Bad Bazooly	After twenty-two years since its first publication, this book has not gotten any better.  It is marketed as horror but comes off as just strange and confused.  The main cast is made up of four toddlers and four mothers.  A few menfolk get added to spice things up.  Blatantly bad mathematics helps drive one of the premises. <br /> <br />Kids might be more special than when they are adults.  They might have more abilities.  Truly special kids may seek out other special kids.  Maybe everyone in New York actually does use the word bazooly.  But what we get are four kids who might be closer than conventionally possible and their slightly off-kilter mothers who arrange the playgroup, a two-hour time slot each day that the kids can get together and not all mothers have to be present. <br /> <br />Might make a nice short story, but the novel is pumped with garbage.  One of the key characters makes a comment about a secret government study of gifted kids but it just gets left out in the end.  In reading this book it is really hard to wonder where the author really wanted to take this book but I get the impression it missed its destination (who is Lokomo?). <br /> <br />The writing can be crude in places.  The mothers seem to have very strange thought processes and keep adding sex to their thought streams.  Bazooly gets used a lot.  One chapter actually starts with the line, \\"Holy speculum, it is you!\\"  Not only is this a strange phrase, but the speaker never says anything even remotely similar at any other time in the book. <br /> <br />This one should be left on the shelves.	2004-11-22

The \\"swimsuit issue\\" is a go and Paris and the gang head for the beach where Glum will handle the shooting.  The shooting and the Swimsuit Issue are handled with Moore's typical humor as is quite well done. <br /> <br />But there is more to this collection than sexing otherworldly beings in next-to-nothing.  A certain seductress shows up and tries to sink her claws into Paris.  Paris and Abbey play a little cat and mouse as they start to be honest about their feelings.  The past of some of the characters comes up as well as more information on the Devil's current plans regarding said cast. <br /> <br />The series is continuing nicely and even the swimsuit issue did not detract from advancing the various plot lines.  Clean art and storytelling make this an enjoyable addition to the series.	2004-11-18

The series changed during that time and I did not always like the changes but I did like the series.  Now we are on the final volume. <br /> <br />It is showdown time.  Gaia has been following Skyler and has learned of many of the Rodke's plans.  Now she is ready to take the offensive.  But while Gaia plans for her survival, many of the other characters are planning for the high school prom.  Both events create endings and closures. <br /> <br />During the course of the book we reunite with some characters we have not seem for several volumes as well as seeing the latest in the \\"curse of th M Names\\" (i.e. Moore, Moss, Moon, etc.).  The volume ends with a collected appendix that brings together some of the facts and events of the series.

They just follow her home or show up on her doorstep.  Meanwhile Paige starts to fall for a flutist and the symphony.  To round things out Phoebe is present at several deaths.    One of the tricks to good fantasy is to make sure that the mundane elements are correct (don't give horses five legs or have bees pollinate corn).  This book really gets it all wrong.  One almost gets the idea that the author has never left her house.    Dozens of kids start disappearing and yet the police are not concerned.  In fact Darryl has to stop finding the children so things won't become too suspicious.    In this story, the symphony has no conductor, a flutist gets to ad-lib in the performance, the perform the same program over and over for weeks, the lights get turned down (and not up) at the start of the performance as I guess these musicians can read in the dark.    Phoebe is present for two murders and there is no investigation.  Not even a cover-up by Darryl.    Finally, typical of many of these books, even though there are very strange things going on, the Charmed Ones don't think of checking into what is going on until almost page 120 (in a 170-page book).    This is really quite possible the worst of the Charmed novels and should probably be skipped.  Don't say I didn't warn you.	2004-11-09

It was discovered by Tom Strong.  In Tom Strong Vol. 2, Tom was enlisted by Tom Strange to help Terra Obscura from an extraterrestrial threat that was destroying his world.  This volume takes place several years later. <br /> <br />Now that the alien threat is gone, the members of SMASH (Society of Major American Science Heroes) are having to deal with a world that is much different from the one before they were frozen for thirty years.  Tom Strange has disappeared and SMASH is pretty much defunct.  One member has been killed and his old partner is out to solve his murder. <br /> <br />But during the investigation, strange things begin to happen in the Grand Canyon and a zone where nothing scientific works is slowly growing.  Soon it starts to spread faster and the existing members of SMASH must reunite and fight this new menace as more and more of the country falls under the zone. <br /> <br />An interesting world, mystery, and storyline.  Definitely an enjoyable read although it would be a good idea to read the pre-story in Tom Strong Vol. 2.  I look forward to more from these characters and their world.	2004-11-03

He always thought he would never return but for some reason he feels he must. <br /> <br />Life is not normal for Corrie.  He only experiences the normal world through dreams.  When he is awake, reality can twist and turn.  This has almost driven him mad but he has held on to his sanity.  Even before he arrives in the town, he spots a pumpkin-headed scarecrow that gestures to him. <br /> <br />Samhain, the Lord of the Dead, is making incursions into Orangefield.  But Samhain is actually working for a more terrifying power.  One that would like to see all life destroyed.  Corrie and his abilities will be needed in some sort of battle to save the world come Halloween. <br /> <br />Nicely plotted with interesting imagery and intelligent twists on Halloween and its symbols.  A good read even if it isn't Halloween.	2004-11-02

Unfortunately, most of the fairy tale lands have been taken over by a villain known as the Adversary.  As a result, the characters have fled to our world where they lead a hidden existence in New York.  Most have been here for centuries.  The main settlement is a colony on Bullfinch street.  King Cole is in charge but Snow White really runs things.  The sheriff is the Big Bad Wolf (a.k.a. Bigby). <br /> <br />At the start of the story, there is a crisis.  Snow White's sister Rose Red has been murdered.  Bigby must try and solve the murder while the community is planning for their annual festival where they raise the money needed to operate for another year. <br /> <br />Jack the Giant Killer, Prince Charming, the Three Pigs, Bluebeard. Little Boy Blue, Beauty and the Beast, and many others come together in this wonderful treatment of fairy tales.  It doesn't hurt that the mystery is well plotted and developed.  A very entertaining read. <br />	2004-11-02

Most of the characters, known as fables, live in one of two areas.  These are the community in New York City and the Farm in upstate New York.  The farm is where most of the non-human-looking fables stay.  Snow White is going for a regular visit to the farm.  She is taking her sister Rose Red in hopes that they can patch up some of their differences. <br /> <br />Once on the farm Snow discovers that there is dissent on the farm.  Many of the animals have decided that the farm is a prison.  They want to take over.  They are modifying modern weapons for use by non-humans and hope to eventually retake their homelands.  Unfortunately this will not be a bloodless revolution. <br /> <br />The three pigs, br'er Rabbit, Sheer Khan, the Three Bears, Cock Robin, Chicken Little, and many others come together in this tale of revolution.  This is not a modern day fairy tale.  This is closer to the original Brothers Grimm.  There is hurt and death involved although you will have to read this one to find out. <br />	2004-11-02

Among the cast were Robin Hood and his men, King Pellinore, The Red Cross Knight, Red Riding Hood and many others. <br /> <br />In main story arc, contact has been made from the fable lands as someone has come through the Canadian gate.  While King Cole and Fabletown want to celebrate the new arrival, Bigby is very suspicious of the new arrival. <br /> <br />But there is more.  Prince Charming begins moving ahead in his bid to run for mayor.  King Cole is overjoyed at the sudden surplus of money from Bluebeard's holdings. <br /> <br />But there is still more.  Agents of the Adversary have also made it to our world and they are preparing to march on Fabletown.  They are numerous and nearly unstoppable.  Technology and magic will be used to defend the free Fables from this new menace. <br /> <br />Another fine story with plenty of twists and revelations thus showing that this series is very far from going stale anytime soon. <br />	2004-11-02

Instead we get four tales of different lengths that help fill in the Fables world. <br /> <br />In \\"Bag o' Bones\\" Jack the Giant Killer has allied with the South in the Civil War.  Once fortunes turn against the South, Jack winds up having adventures involving the Devil, Death, and a beautiful cursed Southern Belle. <br /> <br />In \\"a Two-Part Caper\\" a reporter contacts Bigby to let him know that he knows his secret.  He has discovered the colony of immortals and is convinced that they are vampires.  Bigby, with the help of Sleeping Beauty, Bluebeard, the Frog Prince, Prince Charming and Boy Blue, makes a late night raid to ensure their secret is kept. <br /> <br />In \\"Storybook Love\\", the longest story in the collection, Bigby and Snow become targets and are removed from Fabletown, Prince Charming squares off against Bluebeard, a villain returns, unforseen repercussions arise, and Charming decides to look into running for mayor. <br /> <br />Bigby tells The Frog Prince the story of \\"Barleycorn Bride\\" wherein John Barleycorn must help the rest of the refugee Lilliputians find brides their own size. <br /> <br />The tales in this volume are well-done.  The first and last help fill in some of the history while the middle two move the modern story along very nicely.  Another very entertaining read.	2004-11-02

The Charmed ones might be needed to help an abductee but two of them can't take the problem seriously.  Abductees seem to come back unharmed and with a new attitude towards exercising (they just can't stop). <br /> <br />Maybe something is up after all.  But before the trio can marshal their powers, Piper becomes an exercise nut as well.  Will the power of three be broken?  What is really behind the health craze?  What horrors might be released into our world?  All these questions and more will be answered before the book is done. <br /> <br />This one was not too bad but the author has a little trouble with scale and setting.  Why rent out the Presidio for a \\"secret\\" seminar when the city is full of meeting rooms more than big enough?  Can you really be a national sensation with only about a thousand followers?  Other details also seem to defy reality and logic.  But it is still a fairly entertaining story and one of the better Charmed book plots. <br />	2004-11-01

This is the tale of a small town in New York and the horror that comes to visit one day. <br /> <br />Things start when a young boy disappears while sneaking to a local pool.  His disappearance is not the last as someone else disappears every day.  The manhunt grows but we get glimpses that there is far more than just missing people at stake. <br /> <br />Something is going on in the town and it could affect the world as we know it.  Some readers may be a little confused at first but fans of the Cthulhu Mythos and H.P. Lovecraft will recognize some of the imagery. <br /> <br />Finally, the forces of good and sanity pull together for a final confrontation before all hell breaks loose.  How it ends will have to be left for the reader to discover.  Well-done. <br />	2004-10-25

This is on of the better horror collections I have read in some time with most of the stories being strong. <br /> <br />The stories run across a broad spectrum of topics from characters who lovingly kill their loved ones to hauntings to bizarre monsters that just might fit legends better than we would like.  A fourteenth story is included as a tie to help blend the collection together. <br /> <br />This is horror intended for adults and while not actually being erotic horror, Clegg does not hold back on the language or sex if it helps the story.  If you have enjoyed Clegg's novels, you will not be disappointed by these tales. <br />	2004-10-25

Radio DJ Dan Cooley begins a program to help the hellraised redeem themselves.  Meanwhile the Devil has assigned a new head to the Earthside operations.  As the hellraised get closer to arranging to run a theme park Hell's hidden agenda works its way into the North Carolina residents. <br /> <br />Another fine entry in the series with some very unforseen plot-twists at the end where we find out what has really been going on. <br />	2004-10-05

The request is so pure that it must be answered.  Since everyone in Hell already has a chance for redemption, Heaven sends residents from hell to North Carolina.  These hellraised equal one percent of the population of the state.  The woman is made a target for temptation while the rest of the state has to get used to its new residents. <br /> <br />Overall a pretty good story and an interesting handling of Heven and Hell and they way they interact with the mortal world. <br />	2004-10-05

The books are concerned with the presence of the hellraised on Earth and the interplay between Heaven and Hell. <br /> <br />In the third book, HELL ON HIGH, the devil discovers that one of the Fallen has completely disappeared.  A hellraised private eye is enlisted to track down the missing Fallen and discover how it was accomplished.  Meanwhile the mere existence of the hellraised has bolstered physicists into new areas of research.  Established Laws of Physics are regularly broken by the hellraised so humans should be able to do it as well.  The main project is a stardrive that will enable man to reach the stars. <br /> <br />These books were very enjoyable.  I particularly enjoyed the scenes in Heaven.  This is the Christian Heaven, but all the other afterlife's exist as well and God spends time in all of them.  But while this made for very enjoyable reading the author(s) seemed to have no concept of omnipresence.  I do recommend these books to anyone who likes a bit of light fantasy that is tied together with well-thought out premises and ideas. <br />	2004-10-05

This results in his breaking up with his girlfriend and making other changes in his life.  Becka and Scott must try and help their friend as well as battle the psychic. <br /> <br />There was not quite the dumping of characters the way there was at the end of the last book but there are still a lot of unresolved issues.  I was also very surprised by the forced advertisement for another book (by Z, no less).  I was also surprised when Z made a phone appearance and called Scott.  There were more actual bible references but less prayer.  Then there was the cliffhanger ending although after more than a year there is still no talk of another book in the series.  I might have given this one three stars but the advertising plug was just so jarring that I can't go that high.	2004-10-01

We are treated to character development from many viewpoints and a plot the moves quickly and decisively.  Although war is at the heart of the story, this is not like Busiek's other war story, Arrowsmith.  If you like Busiek's other work, particularly Astro City, you will take delight in this tale.	2004-09-30

Bob DeMoss has now taken the series and moved it closer to Myers's original.  The plot centers around a classmate of Becka's who has delved into Wicca because she has seen it glorified on television on a popular show.  She is interested in seeking to hurt a woman she thinks is having an affair with her father. <br /> <br />Becka is mostly alone in this one although she get plenty of encouragement by phone from other characters (brother, mom, boyfriend). <br /> <br />Unlike Riordan who seemed to lose touch with reality by not getting simple facts correctly, DeMoss does not seem to have that trouble.  Most of the series references are to the original Myers books and not any of the wild Riordan adventures.  DeMoss also make far more use of biblical arguments than Riordan did. <br /> <br />Unfortunately even though the book makes a nice return to the original style, too many plot threads were left hanging (although like the original books they may carry through several volumes, we will have to wait and see).  What has happened with the infidelity, how is Laura handling it, what about Serina the TV star, what about the sudden publicity and public scrutiny?  We'll just have to read more to see if any of this is answered.	2004-09-30

This could be their toughest assignment ever and one of them may fall. <br /> <br />James Riordan does a much better job with this one (yes, he is the author and not Bill Myers).  Very little in the way of facts to get wrong like in his earlier contributions to the series.  There is the standard question of what is going on with the kids and their school that they never seem to attend anymore. <br /> <br />My real disappointment this time comes from the author's insistence on using the term Indian and not Native American.  If we are to truly love our neighbor, should we refer to them by a derogatory word?  I think not. <br /> <br />While this is Riordan's best effort in the series, it is also his last.  Bob DeMoss will be taking over the series with the next book (The Wiccan).	2004-09-29

Gaia decides to pretend nothing has changed while she investigates what is really going on in her life.  She is not happy with what she finds. <br /> <br />Gaia - Ready to fight back.  Trying to fix things up with Jake and Ed. <br />Jake - Looking out for Gaia, still looks up to Oliver. <br />Ed - Still hooked on Gaia but giving it another chance. <br />FOHs - Their evil and petty nature becomes even more apparent. <br />The Rodkes - We learn much about everyone in the family; three siblings and father. <br />Oliver - Looking out for Gaia, but is he becoming Loki again? <br /> <br />This was a good one and has me waiting eagerly for the final book in the series.  My only problem with the book was some of Gaia's soul searching where she tells us that she has always wanted to be a girly-girl (yes, this is after she gets her wits back).  Looking pretty and the prom are actually very important to her (since when?).  Oh, well, still a great book in the series (and look for Fearless FBI starting soon).	2004-09-29

This is one of their tougher battles.  It even includes an unexpected twist when one of the band members makes a play for the under-aged Becka. <br /> <br />Unfortunately while this series is supposed to promote prayer and closeness to G-d, James Riordan keeps mucking it up with incorrect facts and bad writing. <br /> <br />Once again there is no mention of the kids being away from school yet again.  Somehow Scott gets hired as a roadie for the band even though he is only 14!  The musicians actually run the special effects here and not technicians (no wonder there is trouble).	2004-09-29

This time Becka and Scott fly off to Transylvania to save a young actress from a vampire that is stalking her. <br /> <br />These books are supposed to promote prayer and a closeness to G-d but this one is so off the mark that there isn't even any prayer in it!  Obviously the author (James Riordan) has little idea of how movies are made.  It is unlikely that the kids would be allowed to poke around the sets.  Such a low-budget production would not go to the expense of filming in Transylvania unless they actually filmed on location and not in a studio.  Teens in films are usually played by older actors/actresses.  Z mentions that vampire legends go back several centuries (they actually go back several millennia with the oldest vampire tale being found in an ancient book called The Testament of King Solomon from the 1st century (yes, the first vampire story is Jewish)).  There is no mention of the Christian belief that vampires are the result of a suicide at a crossroads.  Still no mention of the kids being out of school.  And more and more and more... <br /> <br />I think that if Mr. Riordan (the same last name as Becka's friend Ryan) is going to take over writing this series he should check his facts as a believable world makes a better foundation for the goals of this series.  This one may be the worst of the lot.	2004-09-29

Armed with prayer and the love of G-d they must go up against some scary forces. <br /> <br />When writing a novel, it is important to get your everyday facts correct.  James Riordan fails in this.  Right from the start with the actions of the airport and pilot we see that the author has not done any non-religious research.  We also get a baseball game being played in the heavy rain, a wheat thresher harvesting sugar cane, and absolutely no mention of the kids being away from school back in California.  If you want the book to work, you have to get the everyday details right.	2004-09-29

The eclipse is just a few days away and the town is getting used to seeing the Apostles around.  They are also getting used to all of the UFO activity in the region.  But none of that helps. <br /> <br />Earthquakes, serial killers, abductions, disappearances, livestock mutilations, and increased activity from the Apostles all combine in a fast-paced tale that takes us through the minds of over a dozen characters as they react to the events and discover some of their destinies. <br /> <br />Some things in this book go unexplained (and have a better impact for it) but most everything all ties together in the end as we see what happens when the four horsemen ride and the end of the world is here (or so they say). <br /> <br />At almost ten-years old this novel does show how Tamara Thorne has developed when compared to her newer books but some of her common themes were already present.  So saddle up and head for the sunset and join the cast as we wait for the coming apocalypse. <br />	2004-09-23

Her brother joined the army and she has not seen him since then.  She feels responsible for his joining and now feels it is up to her to rescue him. <br /> <br />By dressing as a boy Polly soon finds herself under the command of a formidable NCO.  But while maintaining her secret identity Polly learns some of the truths about war and discovers that someone knows her secret.  In her group are also a troll, a vampire and an Igor (as well as a number of humans). <br /> <br />Meanwhile Vimes is about representing Ankh-Morpork which is trying to put an end to this small war.  Somehow Polly and company are at the center of getting everything resolved.  Unfortunately they are more resourceful than expected. <br /> <br />The book follows Polly and company as they head for the front and a final resolution (and revelations).  The book is full of the wit and humor typical of most of the Diskworld books and had me laugh out loud a couple of times (a rare occurrence).  A fine addition to the series. <br />	2004-09-23

The time is the future and chimpanzees have been genetically modified to be closer to humans to be used as a low-cost labor force.  This has all been accomplished by SimTech which breeds the sims and maintains ownership. <br /> <br />But what happens when a lawyer, who once earned money as a golf caddy, insists on tipping a sim golf caddy?  Well, that simple action starts the book off said lawyer is contacted by a group of sims who want to hire him. <br /> <br />Soon his case has him the talk of the country as everyone, including himself, tries to figure out what he is doing with the case and why.  SimTech is especially concerned as it could affect their earnings and even their existence.  Add to that a secret group that is dedicated to exposing SimTech and bringing it down. <br /> <br />Although a legal battle is at the heart of the story, this is not a courtroom drama.  Most of the legalese happens off stage and proceeds as predicted by various characters.  But even after the case is ended, the snowball is still rolling until a final crescendic crash at the end of the book. <br /> <br />This book reminded me why I like F. Paul Wilson so much.  Even when you know what is about to happen, you have to keep reading to see how it is done.  But even with everything you can figure out beforehand, there are still plenty of surprises before the final conclusion.  Definitely a good read that keeps the pages turning. <br />	2004-09-21

The best place to stay is an old hotel that has a dark reputation.  Twice in its history there have been terrible ax murders committed.  First by an old lady and they by a young girl supposedly possessed by the lady.  To make things worse, the daughter looks like the girl from the previous murder.    But nothing can be simple when small towns and hauntings combine, especially when penned by Daniel \\"Ed Gorman\\" Ransom.  More murders suddenly happen and the characters all get swept up in a cyclone of events that threatens lives as well as threatening to expose long-buried secrets.  Secrets that have been hidden for years and whose revelations will cause further tragedy.    Despite the cover, title, and blurb on the back of the book, the phone is just a minor detail in a much richer story that will make you think twice about stopping in that sleepy old small town.	2004-09-21

Each food has a colorful illustration but readers may need help attaching each word to the appropriate picture.  Some of the illustrations are a little questionable (I never saw a cauliflower like the one pictured). <br /> <br />Both of my kids enjoy this book and have had me read it a number of times on just the first day.

It starts with the start of Rosh Hashanah and ends on right at the close of Yom Kippur. <br /> <br />While many may feel that the Day of Atonement may not make for a good story, this book does a very nice job of it.  It touches on the home and the synagogue.  The children experience the joys of the holidays while also reflecting on the more serious aspects (the are sorry for the bad things they have done in the previous year and promise to do better in the coming year).  All of this is wrapped around the Uncle who has been practicing blowing the Shofar as he will have the honor for the holidays. <br /> <br />A very nice and simple story that does a pretty good job of showing and explaining the High Holy Days.	2004-09-13

It does this by pointing out the differences between dragonflies and humans (humans never have to worry about being eaten by a duck).  It starts by asking the title question. <br /> <br />Insects have often been thought of as fascinating for boys and scary for girls and I wonder if that had anything to do with the creation of this book.  I wonder because all of the children pictured are girls. <br /> <br />My daughter was intrigued by the book and had me read it several times.  I do not know if the interest will stick and have more readings requested or not.  One can only think that the series as a whole is best suited for libraries with only the favorite creature or two being purchased for the home. <br /> <br />Whether you decide to borrow or buy is up to you but I am sure you will find the book well laid out and informative. <br /> <br />	2004-09-13

It does not matter if it is a treehouse, a tent, a house costume or even just a picture, Hillel is determined to build a house that he can use during the Jewish holidays.    The story starts with Chanukah but Hillel is not allowed to light his menorah in a cardboard house because of the risk of fire.  And so it goes.  Each holiday there is some reason he can not use his house.  But at the end of the book, the holiday of Sukhot, a holiday just perfect for building houses.    The book touches on most of the Jewish holidays but some are skipped over during the story.  But still, it is a nice look at many holidays and not just a book for Sukhot (although it is especially appropriate).    My only problem was with the artwork.  I did not like the drawings of the father (neither did my wife).  Otherwise check this one out.	2004-09-13

As any loving father would do, he becomes frantic and short tempered with the slowness of results. <br /> <br />As his daughter remains missing, he teams up with the local newspaper editor and begins to dig into the town's history and find that all was not rosy. <br /> <br />As the plot progresses we see that little can stand in the way of desperate father searching for his daughter.

Then there seems to be something wrong with her dad.  He hates her new boyfriend but will not say why. <br /> <br />Boy trouble, dad trouble, and self-esteem issues all need to be dealt with before the end of the book. <br /> <br />This one seems a little lighter than the rest of the series with the troubles being more superficial.  Also, the author seems to be a little unclear on braces other than how they look.  The title actually only makes sense in the final chapter when Nesta gets it all together.

Abe Sapien, Elizabeth, Roger and Johann must continue to fight the forces of darkness, and their own inner demons, without Hellboy by their side. <br /> <br />In The Soul of Venice, the team journeys to the title city where the waters have gone bad and worse.  An interesting look into some of the characters. <br /> <br />In Dark Waters the team is called when a New England town finds the bodies of witches at the bottom of a pond they have drained.  The team must fight the supernatural, mud worms and fanaticism. <br /> <br />Night Train spans decades and includes Lobster Johnson and a train destined for the Manhattan Project.  Roger must do some real soul searching. <br /> <br />There's Something Under My Bed has the team investigating a pattern of child abductions.  You may not look at your toys the same way again. <br /> <br />Finally, in Another Day At The Office (a short story), Abe and Johann look into a town beset by zombies.  Just another day in the offices of the BPRD. <br /> <br />A nice collection of stories, but not one appropriate for someone unfamiliar with the characters.  Past demons are stirred up and a knowledge of earlier Hellboy stories is a necessity.  The artwork is typical of the Hellboy/BPRD stories of the past and is, in my opinion, nothing to write home about. <br /> <br />Still, it is a nice collection of eeriness for fans of the genre.

Afraid that reporting the crime will allow her husband to find her, she keeps quiet.  But then she sees a figure dump another body and gets her new friends involved. <br /> <br />There appears to be a serial killer targeting women in the area and the stretched-too-thin police force is having a hard time with the case.  Add a female cop in charge of \\"women's\\" issues, a dissatisfied priest, a injured sports hero, a philandering deputy and a mysterious killer and you would have a good story. <br /> <br />But that is not all.  It seems that Meriam believes a ancient evil is driving the killer and that Sunny has been chosen to champion the fight.  If only she could remember the legend she was told as a girl. <br /> <br />If the elements of the fantastic were removed, this would still be a very good story.  It is possible it was conceived as such and only changed later.  Whatever the case, this is a seriously good book and worth the read.	2004-09-01

Mary Shelly's tale, Frankenstein: A Modern Prometheus, has lived on as has The Vampyre by John Polidori.  The Vampyre was the first major English vampire story.  Fleshcreepers attempts to bring this classic tale to a younger audience. <br /> <br />The story opens as a young man of means encounters a dead woman one night.  The scene haunts him as he seems to get drawn into other dark scenes.  He becomes fascinated by a the Lord Ruthven, an aristocrat of mysterious nature.  He even goes so far as to go on a tour of Europe with him.  But soon the young man begins to suspect that not is all as it seems with the Lord.  His suspicions and their resolution make up the rest of the story. <br /> <br />This is an entertaining tale, and while intended for younger readers, is far from genteel.  The adaptation does a good job of building the terror and horror and inevitable conclusion.  A pretty spooky little book. <br />	2004-08-27

But just when things seem to be at their worst, he is commissioned for a special role.  He is to stand in for Prince Viktor who is currently under the weather.  Viktor is the middle of three brothers in a small kingdom where the king has recently died.  Palace politics would not allow him to seem weak at this time.  Jordan agrees to the role. <br /> <br />Jordan is enchanted to look and sound like the prince and is schooled in the ways of the castle and family.  But the castle is not an ordinary castle.  It is Castle Midnight and it sits on a site where the real and unreal are very close.  Without a proper king on the throne, the unreal becomes stronger and tries to break though completely.  Add to that the plots and counterplots of the other princes, Regent, and supporting cast and Jordan realizes that this is not an easy role. <br /> <br />Another fine book related to Blue Moon Rising and the Hawk and Fisher books.  The action is non-stop and the mysteries keep the reader guessing right up until the end.  A fun and serious fantasy. <br />	2004-08-27

Unfortunately this one, while a fascinating subject, makes many blunders that destroy the overall work. <br /> <br />In this book we get glimpses of a traditional Hell, as opposed to those in the Infernal books.  A small town is hit by a wave of violence as various postal employees go on individual rampages.  The postmaster is worried and central to the story as is her new romantic interest, the chief of police. <br /> <br />What we have is that various people fall under the control of the Devil's messenger (the evil counterpart to Gabriel).  Each victim commits atrocities at the physical and psychical direction of the Messenger. <br /> <br />Sex and violence play a big part in this story and the reader is gripped with a need to know what happens next right up to the last page.  A very clever story from a true master of horror. <br /> <br />But what of the blunders?  Well here are a few.  A couple has sex after the woman's kids retire for the night.  They go at it again a few nights later in the living room and spend the night there naked.  No mention of kids this time.  The setting is a small town that is described as very quiet and almost totally crime free (the worst being an occasion T-Ping of a tree) but later we learn that the town has an abundance of strip clubs and local prostitutes (huh?).  Anyway, these problems and others will get to some readers but be ignored by others.  The atmosphere of the book is so thick as to help obscure many of the flaws (like no Federal involvement). <br /> <br />If you are a fan of Mr. Lee, you will definitely want to check this one out as it pulls no punches. <br />	2004-08-26

Just as they seem to be at their destination, a plague sweeps the globe.  Victims become crazed with a desire to infect others.  There is also a side effect that reanimates the dead. <br /> <br />It is a much changed world that Lulu must navigate looking for some shred of sanity.  Lulu suffers from a rare genetic disorder and it seems to have made her immune.  Lulu teams up with her supposed father and joins a refugee effort on an old submarine. <br /> <br />Lulu's trek leads her to truths both shocking and unpleasant.  We learn more of the plague and how it works.  Conspiracies, greed, lust for power, and Lulu herself are all brought together in a very original story that is not just a zombie story.  This is more of a cautionary tale that takes the reader into new and original directions.

It is held off by the uniting of four elementals at a certain time and place.  As the story opens, a Firestarter is being pursued by demons as he is to lead the elementals.  As he is overcome, he knows his duties will pass to another. <br /> <br />Twelve-year-old Tyler, a Firestarter, has gone missing.  In the mundane world, Darryl is assigned to the case, and soon finds himself tangled up with the charmed ones once again.  The Charmed Ones quickly get drawn into events and strive to locate and unite the elementals while battling the minions of the demon Tempest. <br /> <br />The sisters split up to find the elementals while Darryl is protecting Tyler.  The story moves forward nicely with little actual magic going on in most of it.  In the end the Charmed Ones and the elementals must face Tempest himself while Darryl learns his true role in things.  Although the title and the demon's name make one think of weather, it is really Earth forces at work as we also experience earthquakes. <br /> <br />This is one of the best Charmed books I have read.  The character development was strong and pronounced, Darryl became far more three-dimensional and the whole thing read like it could have stood on its own and not just as a licenced title.  If you like Charmed at all, you will really like this one.	2004-08-04

Jo now must leave all things human behind and learn how to be a djinn. <br /> <br />But it is not that simple.  She is still linked to David and draining his power.  She must learn to harness power on her own.  Meanwhile something strange is going on in the ethereal plane and it has David scared. <br /> <br />Jo is then assigned to study with Patrick, the only successful human-to-djinn transformation.  And then the action really begins. <br /> <br />Unlike the first book which starts with Jo on the run, this one starts more slowly and it is quite a few pages before the action begins.  But once it begins it does not stop.  As the story races along we learn about the origins of the djinn, ifrit, what is going on in the ethereal plane, the meaning of servitude, more of how djinn work, and some of the limitations of the wardens.  In the end we are left with a satisfying conclusion but also a cliffhanger for the next volume (it can't be released soon enough). <br /> <br />More action like in the first book but with greater depth to the world of the wardens and djinn.  A great follow-up to the first and definitely not the last.	2004-08-04

Star and her life are based, to some extent, on Pamela.  By taking this approach, Pamela can take parts of her life and experiences and spice them up with some fiction and a plot.  Does it work?  Well, that really needs to be left up to the reader. <br /> <br />The revealing cover with its strategically placed stars will appeal to a certain segment of the population.  The fact that the cover is two-sided and can be reversed to reveal a star-free version tells you where this book is aimed.  Although sometimes compared to chick-lit, real chick-lit would not pull such a stunt. <br /> <br />If you are a Pamela Anderson fan you will surely enjoy the book and you will probably substitute Pamela's name for Star's as you read it.  While not for everyone, this is bound to be a big seller.	2004-08-03

This one follows the 2004 Origami calendar with more of the same. <br /> <br />Each spiral bound page opens to a calendar week on the right with a beautiful photograph of an origami exhibit from the Mingei International Museum in San Diego.  Each of these origami art pieces is designed and folded by some of the greatest and most innovative names in the origami world. <br /> <br />The calendar is equipped with spiral bound pages for easy access bound into a very firm hardcover binding.  The inside front cover has a closeable pouch that contains some origami paper and a short booklet of diagrams for making your own origami models. <br /> <br />Like with the 2004 calendar, these are not diagrams for the models so beautifully photographed in the calendar.  These are simple and easy models.  This year fewer of them are traditional models.  The traditional models are: Seated Fox, Triangle Sailboat, 16-Point Star, Scrunch Tree, and Peace Dove.  The additional models are: Penguin by Wendy Zeichner, Pocket Heart by Mark Kennedy, Duck Party Cup by Laura Kruskal, The $2 Pantsuit by Rachel Katz, Fish by Marc Kirschenbaum, Teardrop by Rae Cooker. <br /> <br />All in all a very beautiful calendar that will look good on any desk (or bookshelf). <br />	2004-07-30

It is not.  The covers seem to have very little to do with the contents. <br /> <br />Harold Collins, the one-man UN office of Unit Omega, has been charged with exploring the strange and unusual.  His quantum physics training come is handy.  Harold and science editor Tally Randall may have discovered a white dwarf fragment in the first book.  They are still reeling with the possibilities.  But the UN moves slowly and Harold is impatient so when news comes of some unusual events in Sedona, Arizona, Harold rushes to investigate. <br /> <br />The mystery seems to center on Snake Mountain where status have been found and people have gone missing.  Sedona is thought to be a location of energy vortices and Harold thinks they may be related to the wormhole phenomenon he discovered. <br /> <br />But Harold may have bitten off more than he can chew with this one.  More statues and more missing people, giant snakes, living legends, and a shocking revelation all test Harold's convictions and bravery as he must push forward. <br /> <br />In the first book Harold was sucked, literally, into an adventure and had little time to think.  Now we get to see him in action as he investigates step by step.  Tally continues to help via long distance and provides a good setting for information exchange and idea extrapolation. <br /> <br />The concepts dealt with in these books are of a hard-science nature although they are written more as science adventure.  The science and ideas are good for readers who like to have their thinking stimulated.  I am definitely looking forward to the next book (there may be a teaser at the end of this one for it).	2004-07-29

Three of those books are about Georgia Nicholson.  This is the third instalment in her diaries. <br /> <br />Georgia is just an ordinary teen (or so she says) who just happens to exist in a totally crazy world.  Some of the things she has to put up with are, a four-year-old sister, the king of all cats, amorous parents, idiot friends, a sex-god boyfriend, a red-herring boyfriend, ear snogging, and breasts that are too large. <br /> <br />At the start of the story Georgia is whisked off to Och Aye Land (Scotland) for a bit of holiday.  Or it would be a holiday if it was anywhere else and had her sex-god boyfriend nearby.  But returning is far from the end of her troubles as she has to rally to prevent Angus (her cat) from getting fixed and then has to deal with accidental snogging! <br /> <br />Some of the humor of these stories comes from the timing of the diary entries (keep an eye out for them).  The rest comes from joked that have perfect delivery.  Imitators have yet to come close to matching Rennison's style.  If you want a good laugh, check out the whole series.	2004-07-26

That is the subject of this book. <br /> <br />Meg finds herself as a spirit that is between worlds.  She is not good enough for Heaven or bad enough for Hell.  But the Devil wants her because of her intelligence and ingenuity.  A lesser spirit gives Meg a chance to go back and help someone she has wronged and thus qualify for heaven. <br /> <br />But meg is dogged, almost literally, by her ex partner in crime who is being used as a tool of the Devil.  Meg must avoid him while helping an old man change his own life by correcting the mistakes in his life.  This involves helping him get around to doing four things he has always regretted having been too chicken to do. <br /> <br />The plight of Meg, her elderly charge, and the otherworldly politics all combine to make this an interesting fantasy.  The idea of redemption is a strong one throughout the book but the story stays away from actually being religious (not an easy task).  If you like tales of a put-upon underdog managing to rise above their perceived lot, you will like this book.	2004-07-26

Earthblood, popular name for a plant cancer, has left the world devastated.  Slowly it looks like the virus may have burned itself out and green is just starting to return. <br /> <br />In this devastated world the reigns of power have been seized by to forces.  General Zelig and his Aurora base represent the forces of good.  The Hunters of the Sun represent a more repressive future.  In the middle are Jim Hilton and survivors of the Aquila, a deep space vessel. <br /> <br />In this final book the survivors have united and are pushing to find Aurora.  Zelig and the Hunters are looking for Hilton.  All is leading to a final showdown that will decide the fate of the country. <br /> <br />Nice action, plenty of cliffhangers and twists and a few answers tie up the series nicely.  The series could have easily continued but it ended with the final confrontation.  Some may think the ending is a little vague but I think that was because of the possibility of later books.  But the story is not hurt by it.  Fans of Deathlands will be sure to like this one. <br />	2004-07-20

The survivors again split up in hopes of meeting later; this time in Muir Woods north of San Francisco.  All they know is that Zellig has some sort of base and it is somewhere to the North.  During their travels we begin to learn more about the bad guys: The Hunters of the Sun.<br />Action abounds and cliffhangers pop out at almost every turn.  Ammunition still seems to never run out and there is still no mention of bows.  But still, the book is about action and hope and survival and that is just what it delivers.  Reads like the middle book in a trilogy with plenty of development and travel but little resolution (that should be in the final book).<br />If you like the early Deathlands books you will probably like this trilogy as well.	2004-07-19

But when Jim stomps off in stubbornness, he falls into the pool. Once in the water, he remembers how much fun it is and begins swimming and playing with the other children. <br />The Jim books all center around stubbornness and rhymes. All of the other kids mentioned in this book provide plenty of fun material for the rhymes (now everything doesn?t rhyme with Jim). <br />My daughter loves this book and recognizes Jim from This Is Jane Jim (Jim gets a new baby sister). The artwork is simple, colorful and consistent. If you like Dr. Seuss's rhyming patterns, you will probably enjoy the Jim books.	2004-07-19

Then they notice that the green areas of Earth are now red.  Mission Control or not, they have to land.<br />After most of the crew survive the landing, they discover that the world is a much different place.  A plant cancer has been used as a bio weapon and all of the Earth's crops have been affected.  With no food growing, global population plummeted.<br />The crew finds a message from their old general mentioning a contingency plan and a meeting date in a California ghost town.  With some time to spare, the crew splits up to try and find pieces of their old lives before returning to the meeting place at the end of the book.<br />Written by Laurence James (author of the first thirty-odd Deathlands books), this is an interesting tale of survival and discovery in a devastated, but possibly healing, world.  Much of the action is performed off-stage but there is still plenty in the book.  Many of the usual pitfalls of such fiction abound such as everyone seems to be good at wasting ammunition and no one seems to have figured out the long-term advantages of bows.<br />Still, a pretty good tale with an interesting plot full of surprises and cliff hangers.  There are only three books in this series (Deep Trek and Aurora Quest being the others).	2004-07-15

Like all of Clarke's later books, 3001 was very entertaining and also thought-provoking.  This volume completes Clarke's speculative series.  Each book stands alone in its time line but are related by common themes.  They are really four versions of one story each told from a different point in the story.  For instance, in 2010, Jupiter becomes a sun that burns for thousands of years.  In 2061, the Jupiter-Sun burns out.  In 3001 the Jupiter-Sun is still burning brightly.<br />Frank Poole's body has been found drifting in space and then revived.  The last thing Poole remembers is being on a mission to Jupiter.  Now he finds himself in a world a thousand years later.  The ban keeping humanity away from Europa is still in effect.  Because of Poole's relationship with Bowman, it is suggested that he might be able to land on Europa.  Poole tries and is successful.  He is contacted by what was Bowman.  Later, in another contact Bowman brings distressing news.  The nearest center of the intelligence that created the Monoliths is about 450 light-years away.  That means that the events of 2001 have made it there, a decision has been reached and the answer is almost here.  Bowman also knows of a link between the Monolith makers and a nova that has been puzzling scientists.  It appears that a planet exploded and that triggered the nova.  A similar fate might be in store for humanity.  The forces of Earth, aided buy Halman (Bowman and HAL), put together a plan to survive.  The most destructive computer viruses ever devised will be fed into the Monolith by Halman.  The plan proves to be successful.<br />3001 is billed at the final Odyssey but it really opens up more questions than it answers.  Now that Earth and Humanity have the attention of the Monolith builders how can we expect them to ignore us?  I don't think they would but Clarke is done writing in this series.  Maybe Gentry Lee will pick up the torch and continue the run.  Another amusing aspect is the continual references to Star Trek.  Clarke has also taken the opportunity to update some of the technology and history that Frank Poole should be familiar with.  All in all it was another fine effort from possibly the greatest science fiction writer still writing.  The book also contains an extensive afterword detailing scientific research, history and plot similarities with other projects.  If you have read any of the other Odyssey books I recommend reading this one as well.	2004-07-14

These are some of the questions addressed in VIRUS CLANS by Michael Kanaly.  This novel takes on the very scary concept of intent within viruses.<br />In this contemporary novel we meet a research scientist working at the ground floor on a project to create a protein-reading computer.  The project has great potential for fame once successes are made.  But during an early experiment a startling discovery is made; viruses pass small proteins back and forth.  What is the purpose of these proteins?  Is it some primitive form of communication?  Some lateral thinking on the part of the researcher prompts more tests while early news of the protein passing gets squashed by the government.  It seems that the CDC feels this is a National Security Issue.  But great minds are not known for giving up.<br />With a small, basement setup, the researcher continues his work.  After weeks and major erosion on the marriage front, a small portion of a passed protein is read.  What does it mean?  He needs the resources of the full lab to find out.  When the check is made it is discovered to be the same as a sequence found in the human frontal lobe.  More questions are asked and more conclusions reached.  Viruses are changing people.  What is being changed?  Unknown, at this point.  But then another cover-up is leaked.  Segments of the medical community have noticed growing numbers of a strange madness that seems to have no physical cause.<br />How may proteins exchanged by viruses and a new form of madness related?  The answer is revealed in a manner that is both hopeful and horrifying at the same time.  In VIRUS CLANS, Michael Kenaly utilizes the uncertainties in the science of evolution to spin a yarn that is gripping horrifyingly cohesive.  The concepts put forth in this novel, and their consequences, are both scary and comforting.  Some readers will probably disagree on the comfort angle but in my own personal feelings I do find some of the book comforting.  If you like fairly hard science fiction cast more in shadow than in light, then you will probably enjoy this book.	2004-07-14

Applegate and am rather pleased with it.  My wife has also gotten into the series.  Applegate is best known as the creator of the Animorphs series.  In this series four not-quite friends find themselves pulled into a strange world called Everworld.<br />In the first volume the four are drawn together just in time to see a fifth, a girl named Senna, get dragged away by an elephant-sized wolf.  They get drawn after the wolf and find themselves chained and hanging on a castle wall.  The castle belongs to Loki, the Norse god of evil.  It was Loki who sent Fenris the wolf to capture Senna.  Senna turns out to be some sort of witch.  But somewhere along the way Senna was dropped and Loki wants her found.  Loki managed to escape from his prison when Everworld was created.  This gave him the chance to imprison Odin in revenge.  But Loki is also working with some sort of powerful alien.<br />The four manage to escape Loki's castle and run into a gathering of Vikings.  They are getting ready to sail off to a great battle.  The four are mistaken for minstrels and are taken on the voyage.  The Vikings are out to raid the Aztecs.  Using Mjolnir they hope to get the head of Huitzilopoctil as a tribute to Loki so that he will release Odin the All Father.  Volume one ends as the great battle begins.<br />Everworld is an interesting place.  It is of recent creation compared to the creation of our solar system.  It is populated by many ancient peoples including Vikings and Aztecs.  Powerful beings who claim to be gods also reside here.  But where is here?  Is it some sort of dimension created by the mysterious aliens?  It in not a completely physical place.  The characters return home when the fall asleep or lose consciousness in Everworld.  But they are not missing in our world.  They seem to be existing in two places at once with memories of being in both places.<br />I am looking forward to uncovering more of the mysteries as the series progresses.  Volume one is SEARCH FOR SENNA.  The narrative switches between characters from book to book.  If you are interested in some good adventure that makes you think, but not too hard, then you might want to look for this series.	2004-07-14

This on is titled THE SMARTEST MAN IN IRELAND and like last many others this book touches heavily on Irish myth and legend.<br />Patrick Kentigern Keenan claims he is the smartest man in Ireland.  He might very well be but he wants to prove it.  In order to prove that he is as he claims, Patrick attempts to outsmart the fair folk.  He begins by trying to trick a leprechaun but does not succeed as well as he would like.  Several schemes later he is no closer to proving his case.<br />But then his young son is enchanted by the Fairy Queen and is being held captive.  Utilizing his knowledge of legend, Patrick prepares himself for a confrontation on the Fairy's home ground.<br />In the end Patrick not only outsmarts the fair folk, but he neutralizes their power in the land.  When the local townsmen set out to disprove his claims they find that he was telling the truth and they are forced to admit that he really is the smartest man in Ireland.<br />A very entertaining and quick read with plenty of good honest Irish lore.  It is a pleasure to read a story based on so simple and Irish concept without getting bogged down the way so many modern Celtic fantasies do.  THE SMARTEST MAN IN IRELAND was first released in 1962 but has recently been reissued by Magic Carpet Books.  So if you like tale of the mischievous wee folk, you should take a look at this book.  It's worth it!	2004-07-14

A recent conversation with a stranger in the lands beyond Avalon regarding the holiday and its origins have made me decide to review another old book that some may have overlooked.  The book is called THE HALLOWEEN TREE and was written by Ray Bradbury.<br />This book tells the story of a group of small boys and a dangerous adventure they all share one Halloween with a spooky character named Clarence Clavicle Moundshroud.  Much of the tale is taken up by the search for a missing friend.  But while the plot is simple and originally aimed at younger readers the book has a second level.<br />The second level concerns Halloween and its history.  But it also touches on similar celebrations in other cultures, such as the Mexican Day of the Dead, and the common origins for these festivals.  While the story is entertaining it manages to keep you from realizing just how much you are learning when reading the book.<br />THE HALLOWEEN TREE was adapted for television at one point but I feel that production just doesn't hold a candle (or jack-o-lantern) to the book.	2004-07-13
591776:US	38672733	R1YR7VP7A2CN9V	034531977X	507854420	Tarzan of the Apes (Tarzan (Ballantine))	Books	5	24	28	N	N	The Tarzan Legend Begins	I felt it would be a good idea to review the original TARZAN OF THE APES by Edgar Rice Burroughs as many are only familiar with how the character has been mishandled for the past seventy or so years.  In his original form Tarzan was far from the monosyllabic simpleton as he was so often later portrayed.  Instead, Tarzan was a man of aristocratic bearing who wielded great strength of both body and will, spoke several languages fluently, and easily mixed with British society.<br />Although Tarzan first appeared in TARZAN OF THE APES, the plot and some of Tarzan's characteristics were showcased in an earlier Burroughs work called THE MONSTER MEN.  But it was the infant heir to a British title that rocketed Burroughs's fame.  Tarzan begins as an infant shipwrecked on the coast of Africa.  The rest of his family quickly dies but a local anthropoid ape (not a gorilla) who just lost a baby, claims pale, hairless baby and raises it as her own.  Tarzan grows but is always weaker than the apes.  But when Tarzan finds the hut left by his family he begins learning about his human side.  With knowledge Tarzan is able to stand up to the more bullysome apes and life is good.<br />Years later thing change drastically when pirates maroon other humans near Tarzan's home.  It is then that Tarzan learns to love Jane and she him although she first knows him as two different people.  To her there is the forest god who rescues her and there is Tarzan who leaves her notes.  But while Tarzan can read and write English and speak the language of the apes, French is the first human tongue he learns.  A tongue that Jane does not understand.  But eventually Jane becomes the force that drives Tarzan towards civilization and his birthright among British nobility.<br />In this first Tarzan novel, Edgar Rice Burroughs explores the idea of class as inherent.  A British lord will always be a British lord and will always rise to the top no matter how far he has been pushed down.  Tarzan, being raised by an unknown species of intelligent apes, has further to rise than any lord in history.  But the rise he does because class will always prove itself.  This is a popular theme and one that, in detective fiction, shows the difference between the British view and the American view.  The British view used to hold that an aristocrat acting as an amateur, with easily best the professional laborer as in the Sherlock Holmes stories.  The American view in detective fiction is that the closer to the grit you are the better you are at solving mysteries as in the Colombo or Sam Spade mysteries.  But in TARZAN OF THE APES Burroughs takes the British view to its extreme.<br />TARZAN OF THE APES and the other early Tarzan novels are classics of adventure fiction.  Lost cities, ancient civilizations, true love, heroism and other qualities of great adventures are all present in these novels.  My wife really enjoys the original Zorro stories packed with romance and heroism.  But when I lent her some of my Tarzan books she quickly became a fan of his stories as well.  If you have never treated yourself to the original and only know what television and Hollywood have done to him, I recommend that you give Tarzan a try.  I think you will be surprised.	2004-07-13

It is a successful family with members all over the world in almost every niche.<br />A young boy and his father are attacked at a little league game by some bats.  The bats are insectivores but seem to be acting in a territorial fashion.  Once the boy and his father move away the bats leave them alone.  But then there are other sightings.  The bat population of New York City seems to be climbing but there is also something else going on.<br />The carcass of a deer found in a tree top and some dead homeless in the city's subway system indicate something far more powerful than any bat.  It could be that whatever is responsible is causing the normal bats to act with abnormal behavior.  When a bat expert and a policeman team up they find a trail leading across the surrounding countryside and leading into the city.  The evidence points towards a mutant bat brought in from Russia that has managed to propagate.<br />Now the problem is known but there is the matter of getting the right people top believe it.  There is an abnormally large bat loose that somehow controls the smaller bats.  But soon the bat is spotted by the authorities and plans are made for its capture.  But there are two and one is pregnant so there is little time.  The final confrontation is a real page turner.<br />VESPERS is a very interesting book.  On the front of it we have a monster story.  But that story is handled more like a vampire tale than anything else.  Mix in some classic Night Stalker-esque interactions between the investigators and the City officials and you get a far more complex book than one would first think.  In a way it reminds me of NIGHTWINGS, by Martha Cruz Smith, which also has bats on the surface but a much richer, and deeper, story line lurking just below.  VESPERS is an excellent book and Jeff Rovin really knows how to pace it to keep the reading following.	2004-07-13

Among these is Pendragon's widow Morgause.  She wants one of her boys to be on the throne, possibly her eldest Gawaine.  Although Arthur is a fair and just king it will take more to win over some.  Merlinnus (Merlin) comes up with an idea to cement Arthur in his position.  An idea involving a stone and a sword.<br />In Cadbury (Camelot) much is going on.  Gawain and his brothers are arriving, Gawen has arrived and become Merlinnus's helper, word has it that Morgause is sending an assassin, and a shepherd finds a mysterious stone with a sword sticking out of it.<br />You may have thought you knew the story but this version is fresh and full of surprises.  A wonderful fantasy full of magic and intrigue.	2004-07-13

I had really enjoyed the books Clarke wrote just before CRADLE.  I also enjoyed the books written later.  But somehow I didn't get around to reading CRADLE until now.  I must say that I was disappointed.  I had been expecting Clarke's style as I had read in such books as THE HAMMER OF GOD and GHOST FROM THE GRAND BANKS.  But the Clarke-Gentry mix just didn't do it for me.<br />The book could be easily described as RAMA doing the work of the Overlords from CHILDHOOD'S END.  An unmanned probe comes to Earth to elevate the human species and restore a number of others.  This plan is stumbled across by a reporter looking into the alleged disappearance of a secret Navy missile.  The probe is making a journey to a dozen planet.  At each planet it will assemble life forms based on specimens collected on an earlier visit.  In CRADLE, a couple of humans get a chance to tell the aliens that we don't want humans to be elevated.  That's pretty much it.<br />I had a hard time getting through this book.  I normally fly through Clarke's books but this one was just bogged down in unnecessary details.  This book also contained a large number of sexual scenes that I have to assume were the work of Lee as I have not encountered their like in Clarke's work.  I really cannot recommend this book to anyone, so if you haven't read it and were considering it I have to give you fair warning.	2004-07-13

This is an original story based on the characters created in the movie Men In Black.  Earth is the stopping point for a dangerous alien life form.  This alien resembles a flowering plum tree and is capable of quickly killing and eating just about any animal life form in the galaxy.<br />Jay and Elle (the coroner from the movie) head up the operation to eliminate these killer trees before they begin to breed.  To make matters worse it seems that a number of other races have learned that the trees are on Earth.  They all have their own reasons for wanting to carry out a vendetta against the trees regardless of how it effects Earth.  As the Earth is watched by countless war ships, Jay and Elle work their way through eliminating all of the trees.<br />This is a fun adventure and is true to the mythos of the movie except in two spots.  I can accept Jay continuing to refer to the neuralizer as a flashy thing but I don't accept it from the narration.  Smith (Dean Wesley and not Will) also makes a mistake regarding the Centaurian twins that help run the MIB operation.  In the book he claims they are referred to as The Twins because no-one can pronounce their names.  This worries me because I can't accept an organization where nobody can pronounce \\"Bob\\".  Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) introduces them to Will Smith in one of the funnier scenes because their names are Sklweebleohp and Bob.  Otherwise this book is an enjoyable addition to the movie.	2004-07-13

Jory Rask is a shockball player and a very good one.  One reason is that she is half alien; a fact that comes out after her mother's death and results in deportation.<br />Jory knows some of her Jorenian heritage and has promised her mother that she will seek out others like herself and let them know the truth.  The truth is that her mother and a number of other Jorenian women were captured, enslaved, and bore children of their slavers.<br />Truth can be a painful thing and Jory and the others wind up entering training to become warriors and assassins.  But like in many schools, cliques form and rivalries form.  But at a school of combat rivalry can be deadly.<br />The plot moves well and at one point you may wonder what the author is up to.  Many surprises lurk beneath the surface but the planned shocking revelation is obvious for a hundred pages prior.  Still, a good tale set in a rich universe (although medicine seems to be way behind the times).	2004-07-12

There is actually a scene overlap between the two stories to help cement the time frame of the second.<br />Sign of the Demons has Navee and other Wake agents looking into the disappearance of a previous team on a world ripe for contact.  This world, much like Wake, has numerous races with the First Five being in charge of the others.  Navee's quest teaches her about a downtrodden race, liberty and treachery.  Then end is slightly unresolved concerning the fate of one of the characters but the resolution on the planet is quite satisfactory.<br />The second tale, (unreadable title), plays like a tribute to Mother Teresa.  Navee's celebrity makes her a target of reactionaries trying to help the plight of their impoverished people.  Their race is the majority on Wake but most live in shanty towns set up in garbage scows.  One nun is working with them to try and improve the lot of at least a few.  Navee tries to become a reactionary celebrity to help them.  In the end she learns the lesson the nun had to learn long ago.  A pretty good tale but I was a little unsure where the reactionaries were able to get their expensive supplies.<br />A good double-dose of space opera and humanity.  A fine addition to the series and possible the strongest.	2004-07-09

Navee, the lone human amongst the countless aliens of Wake, has been offered a new assignment.  She is to investigate a civilization that has sprung up much too quickly on an alien world.  There is also evidence of some form of massive underground installation that may hold the answers.  The natives are the closest thing to human found so far.<br />Navee disguises herself as a local and quickly joins with a local revolutionary.  The current government is seen as oppressive and overly-controlling.  Now a revolution is just starting to enter into action.<br />Navee's involvement is full of action as the pair make their way through security checks and into the wilderness where the installation is hidden.  Along the way Navee discovers many truths about the planet and her companion.  There is even a human present at the installation.<br />Once again, the ending is surprising and well plotted.  One can really feel Navee's predicaments among the aliens.  Another fine read full of quality artwork.	2004-07-08

After the world she knew as home was hottard-formed, she found herself among the denizens of Wake.  Now her initial benefits are running out and the rulers of Wake have offered her a position as a special agent.  Her immunity to having her mind read makes her especially useful.<br />Navee's forceful personality and unique nature have made her a favorite among some including a pair of scientists and a general.  But now she has also caught the eye of a powerful scoundrel who wants to add her to his collection of women.  But targeting Navee may be a mistake.<br />Clear art, interesting angles and a good story are combined in this volume into a fine read.  Although not quite a space-operaish as one might expect, there is wonderful character development and the ending may point the way to a future adventure.	2004-07-08

Oil prospectors in the Sahara find a buried artifact that turns out to be a flying saucer about 140,000 years old.  Despite this, this novel is not a science fiction novel.  Instead it is a military action thriller.<br />News of the saucer leaks.  Satellites spot it from orbit.  Soon many powerful forces are trying to gain control of the craft.  But Rip Cantrell first found the saucer, and with the aid of a test pilot, manage to keep hold of it for a while.  The saucer continues to be a focal point for military actions and the action seldom stops.<br />Throughout the book Rip tries to retain ownership of the saucer but it is his feelings for the beautiful test pilot that really puts him at ground zero.<br />A nice and fast-paced tale with a resolution that actually seems to work (although I wonder about the repercussions for the Japanese SDF).  Rip is a likeable character but seems to bounce back and forth between country bumpkin (which he is not) and the genius that he really is.  The other characters are also well defined and interesting (good guys and bad).<br />All in all I have to recommend this one for fans of military thrillers.  Science Fiction fans may also like it but the Saucer is really just a catalyst for the tale.	2004-07-07

Young Navee is the only survivor of a crash on a forest world.  There she has lived in harmony with HooYoo (a tiger-like being).  But her world suddenly changes with the arrival of the star-spanning convoy called Wake.<br />A surveyor is accidently brought down by Navee's slingshot.  The alien Majestee has arrived to raise surface temperatures to help his race.  Navee's presence could end it all.<br />Action and intrigue combine as Navee tries to save herself and her world.  She is also introduced to the cloned Migers, powerful work drones who live to serve.<br />A fast-paced tale of a lone human looking for keys to her past.  Navee's strong moral code makes for an excellent driving force in the tale.  Space opera at its best.	2004-07-07

But now things may have changed for the better as a successful man becomes interested in her to the point of marriage.  His first wife left him four years previously.  The only downside is his 8-year-old son Josh who thinks his mother will return.<br />But things begin to go a little strange as Linda and the rest start to have dreams of burning in fire.  Then, a woman shows up claiming to be the beautiful first wife.  Josh thinks she is not his mother but she eventually bribes herself into his affections.  With the return, Linda becomes unsure of her future although her fiance seems to still be in love with her.<br />But the first wife has a way about her and Linda's new world seems to be crumbling.  Desperate for what she had, Linda reaches out to friends and counselors and delves into the secrets of the first wife.<br />Ghosts, psychic phenomenon, time travel, magical beasts, ancient gods and a few other tricks get thrown into the mix in a plot that just doesn't quite work.  Acceptance of strange phenomena is just too easy for many characters to accept.  There are also some points that the characters miss which seemed odd in light of all of the contemporary cultural references made (and they never heard of Harry Potter?).<br />All in all I found myself trying to figure out what was going on but not really liking how it was going there.  It seemed a lot like a first draft.  I can't really recommend this book.	2004-06-30

Like the previous volumes this was a very well-done book.  I don't know if the series has a better bible than others but so far all of the characters act just as they would be expected to on the show.<br />At the end of Summer a carnival comes to Sunnydale.  Shortly after that, coyotes are seen closer to town than usual.  Buffy  starts to get the wiggins about the carnival and finds some minor evidence that they are involved in something not normal.  Eventually a plot involving werecoyotes and skinwalkers is revealed.  Unfortunately for the townsfolk the plot involves the carnies seducing and slaughtering a number of Sunnydale's young folk.  In the end Buffy triumphs and curses are lifted.<br />While this volume is quite good it is not canonical.  The events take place at a time that we now know Buffy was not in Sunnydale.  This puts it in a class with many of the Star Trek books. So if you consider this an old episode you missed then it works out quite well.  Unfortunately these books are a little hard to find because they are being marketed towards young adults (hah, my 78 year-old father is one of the show's biggest fans).	2004-06-28

This is based on Germany's best-selling game Realms of Arkania.<br />A strange story of a magic-assisted plot but where no one suspects magic of being used to ill purposes.  There is a tendency to skip scenes sort of like in Monty Pythons' The Cycling Tour where the pair escape a charge of bayonets somehow during a missing scene.  It also seemed odd that the characters never once thought of not drawing attention to themselves why they we being hunted down by every guardsman in the land.	2004-06-28

Koontz if you remember his older work).  Needless to say the movie previews have little in common with this 1983 novel.<br />A small western town of about five-hundred residents, becomes suddenly deserted.  The town's doctor was away during the event.  She now returns with her younger sister after their mother's death.  A few bodies are found but most of the residents are missing.  They apparently left suddenly; sometimes in the middle of eating.  The county sheriff is summoned and the investigation begins.<br />Fearing a possible disease or other biological hazard, the town is quarantined.  A bio-weapons unit arrives but the evidence points to something other than poison or disease.  Slowly the truth begins to emerge.  A terrifying truth.  A truth that explains all of the mysterious mass disappearances of history.<br />Koontz does a fine job of creating a situation that both hooks the reader immediately and still continues to build for four-hundred pages.  A very good, captivating read.  There is some evidence of being influenced by Kate Wilhelm's 1962 novel THE CLONE, Harry Adam Knight's novel SLIMER and by the early Blob movies.  But unlike these earlier efforts, Koontz adds a level of depth to the characters and action while firmly sitting the whole thing on a bed of history.  Check it out.	2004-06-28

Some readers stopped reading after the bar was destroyed in a nuclear explosion.  But the latest book, CALLAHAN'S LEGACY, is a good reason to give the later series a better look.<br />This latest volume takes place in Mary's Place, Jake's new bar.  Most of the usual characters are present as well as a few new ones who happened through the front door.  Jake's wife is nine and a half months pregnant when the story opens.  The story progresses through some of the usual tales and word games we have come to expect.  Then Mary and Mickey Finn suddenly appear unconscious on the floor.  Once revived it becomes clear that a terrible threat is heading towards Earth.  Finn's counterpart is coming.  Jake and the gang must find a way to save the Earth.  During that course we learn how some of the older members first found Callahan's Place and we gain some new insights into the author.<br />I will not give away the ending but I will say that I found it to be one of the better books in the extended series (that includes the Sally books).  While an entertaining and light-seeming read, there is plenty to stimulate the brain.  Word games (and puns) are found throughout the book along with some other mental exercise equipment.  If it has been a while since you last visited with the Callahan's gang you should pick up this book and drop in again, I am sure they would like to see you.	2004-06-28

The main characters are Lucky George Faustus, who has escaped from Hell, and Kurt Lundqvist, the greatest bounty hunter of all time.  The problem is that even after finishing the book the reader is still left with no direction as to which side they should root for.  Is this a twist like in Bedazzled where the Devil is the good guy or are the characters just not defined enough?  I don't know but the book was definitely missing something.	2004-06-28

Axler is best known for the adventures of Ryan Cawdor in his Death Lands series.  His new series, Outlanders, is both similar and different and is better.<br />Centuries after the nuclear war that laid waste to much of the world, civilization is slowly regaining control.  The Barons rule fortified cities that bring law and order to their surrounding territories.  This law is enforced by the Magistrates, an elite marines-like force.  Kane is one of these Magistrates but he thinks for himself a little too much.<br />A mission that should be routine raises countless questions in Kane's mind.  Wanting to know the truth he pilfers some evidence at the scene.  With the help of an archivist, Kane learns that all is not as it seems.  There seems to be a ruling body above the Barons but they are shrouded in mystery.  But Kane's questions don't go unnoticed.  The powers that be see him as a threat and move to eliminate him, his partner and the archivist.<br />But Kane manages to escape along with the others and they flee into the wilds to the side of their last mission and the mysterious Gateway they found there.  They manage to activate the gate just before being captured and wind up at the secret headquarters of the resistance.  Here they learn the truth.<br />While man was still living in caves aliens arrived on Earth and they have been here ever since.  Using their advanced technologies they became puppet masters behind many rulers.  Their plans for a final, and complete, takeover were interrupted by the nuclear war (or did they cause it?).  But now, with humanity reduced to a manageable size, the aliens are exerting their control through the hybrids that are know as the Barons.  Having learned this truth, Kane and company agree to help thwart Earth's would-be masters.<br />Outlanders is set in the same world as Death Lands (a series still being written) but is much more science fiction oriented.  Although Outlanders is still sold with those books that used to be called Men's Adventure before political correctness changed it, the series does not really read like that genre.  In fact, it bears more relation to the military SF sub-genre but with less detail in weapon descriptions.  Outlanders is a real surprise and one can only think that with the right marketing that it could become very popular.	2004-06-28

Set in the Scottish Highlands, this is a tale of magic and legend and how it meets the modern world.<br />Young Donald Campbell is exited when he learns that a hydroelectric dam will be built in his glen.  The dam was foreseen by the Bodach, an old man who lives nearby.  But even as Donald and the whole town become excited by the idea of the dam the Bodach declares that the glen will not be flooded until he gives his leave.<br />Over many seasons the dam is constructed but the Bodach refuses to move to his new home.  Instead, he stays in the glen.  When Royalty shows up to start the dam working, the workers shut it back down shortly after for they will not be party to the drowning of an old man.  The crew then set out in pursuit of the old man, but they can never catch him.  Just when they think they are close, he is suddenly on the other side of the glen.<br />As Donald tries to understand the Bodach's reasons, he learns of the legends surrounding the stone circle that occupies a part of the glen.  The stones are said to walk to the river once every hundred years and the time is fast approaching.  But then Donald learns something even more astounding, the Bodach has been training him to be his successor and will be given the second sight in a strange ritual.<br />THE WALKING STONES is a very entertaining book and fun for anyone who enjoys a good Celtic legend.  Stone circles have figured in many tales but few have dealt with the encroachment of the modern world on a land of legend quite as well as Mollie Hunter has.  And if that alone is not good enough, the finale, when Donald confronts his future and fulfills a promise to the Bodach, is alone worth the price of the book.	2004-06-28

Now, many rabbit generations later, Adams has released TALES FROM WATERSHIP DOWN.  Having thoroughly enjoying the first one I had to read this one.<br />The book begins with stories of El-ahrairah, the great rabbit hero of legend.  From there we get a pair of modern tales and then it returns to El-ahrairah again and finally ends up with some more stories of Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig and the other rabbits of Watership Down.<br />The individual stories are entertaining.  I always enjoyed the El-ahrairah stories.  But when the book moves to the present it loses it.  Sure, I was curious as to what happened to the Watership rabbits, but I had hoped for more.  This reads more like details of what might happen happily ever after.  After the drama of the first book, this reads like a happy couple arguing about decorating.  There is no drama, no strife, no plot!  I hate to say it but Adams might as well have replaced the Hazel stories with the phrase: The population on the Down grew so some of the rabbits spread to a new warren.  Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to give the whole thing away.<br />I was quite disappointed in this book.  Maybe it was that I loved the first book.  Maybe I felt Adams was a better writer.  Maybe many things.  But in my opinion there is more substance and worth in the average Lin Carter novel than in this 300 plus pages book where possibly the most entertaining part is the glossary of Lapine Terms.  I would not recommend this book.  But if you are looking for the literary equivalent of Nutrisweet cotton candy, go ahead and pick it up.	2004-06-28

One young man is found dead in a locked room where he was logged in.  His throat was cut and there are no sharp objects in the room.  A detective notices that a number of other similar deaths have occurred recently.  Thus two quests are taken up as two women log in disguised as the young man and try to find out what he was doing and who he may have met.  It is a strange world where things are more real than real.  Sensations are heightened and rumors exist of a way out the other side.  It is this world that the two women must navigate to find out what happened.<br />The switching viewpoints are a little more confusing that is usual but the future world is quite interesting.  I like the melding of cyberpunk, virtual reality and Japanese philosophy.  It blends well and offers a good backdrop for that rare commodity, the science-fiction mystery.  I picked up the book to look at it and found myself hooked right away.  A very entertaining read if you don't mind having your mind bent and limbered up a bit.  Check it out.	2004-06-28

This is a collection of stories intended to be released as WITCH'S BREW, but suffered from a title change.<br />The stories in this collection generally concern witches and spells.  I found the tales to be very entertaining.  Some of the stories like Skin Deep, start out along familiar paths but end in an original manner.  Original endings are par for the course with these stories.<br />One story, Witch-Hunt, is so close to reality as to be frightening.  To Converse With Dumb Beasts was also very real to anyone who has lived with a cat or a dog.  But all of the stories are fresh and entertaining as well as original.  The whole thing is wrapped up with an afterword about each story's origin and finally the book boasts a wonderful cover (no credit given).	2004-06-28

I was first introduced to Ketchum through his novels OFF SEASON and OFFSPRING which concerned a small town haunted by a cannibalistic family descended from shipwreck survivors.  But ROAD KILL hits much closer to home and is thus not suitable for everyone.<br />A woman decides that the only way she can be free of her abusive ex-husband (one who has scarred her and been unrestrained by restraining orders) is to kill him.  She and her new boyfriend come up with a plan and carry it out one dark night.  By they were not alone.  Their actions were witnessed by a man who became fascinated with what they had done.  He has often wondered what it would be like to kill someone, but has never had the courage to follow his desires.<br />Obsessed with this couple who have done what he cannot, the man tracks them down.  He wants to talk to them to see what it was like.  He wants all of the details.  But his obsession grows and soon he has killed his first victim.  He is ecstatic and drags the couple around on a killing spree.  But the police manage to track him down rather quickly and put and end to the short-lived horror.<br />ROAD KILL is an excellent example of psychological horror.  The reader is drawn into the mind of a slightly twisted individual where they can then see the complete breakdown piece by piece.  The terror lies in just how easily the deterioration progresses.  The victims are random and could be anybody.  It manages to convey the ides that we live in a very dangerous world where anything can happen.  But at the end of this novel we find out that justice is not completely blind and that the sword of justice can be blunted with compassion.  And that can give the reader hope.	2004-06-28

The book was good (as usual) and sort of followed a path similar to that in ARTIFACT in that you have some characters trying to learn about a mysterious object.<br />An ambitious, young physicist is running an experiment on RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) using streams of elliptic uranium.  At first everything is fine but then the readings seem to slow down.  Suddenly there is a massive explosion.  Amidst some of the wreckage is a reflective sphere about the size of a bowling ball.  The physicist knows this has something to do with the explosion and takes the sphere for observation.  Unfortunately she is a little too secretive and charges of theft and impropriety are raised.<br />The sphere is an enigma.  It feels solid but doesn't seem to be made of anything.  It has no spectrum.  Light can penetrate is slightly.  It emits photons as if it were at four-thousand degrees.  It seems to have a tidal effect near the surface.  What is this object?  The physicist teams up with a theorist to try and solve the mystery.  But as the mystery becomes clear bit by bit, the political and scientific climates intensify.  Finally, a theory is arrived at that seems to take into account all of the facts.  The object is a pocket universe with an internal time that is accelerating.<br />Soon the sphere becomes transparent and the birth of galaxies can be witnessed.  As time speeds up in the sphere, now called a Cosm, it becomes more and more important to continue observations.  But as the experiment demands closer inspection and more time, the charges against the physicist also demand more time.  Although the physicist warns against it, the Brookhaven Lab repeats the experiment and creates a much larger Cosm.  Unfortunately this one is too big to move and is obstructing repairs to the RHIC.  The story's threads all build and collide in an ending that brings about a number of interesting questions about the nature of our own universe.<br />COSM is a very good novel that Gregory Benford first had the idea for in the late 1980s.  A number of theories, studies, and publications are mentioned in this novel and they are all real.  Even if you are not a promising particle physicist the story is very easy to follow.  The characters all seem to act consistently and I found no obvious flaws that detracted from the novel.  If you like hard science that is located right on the edge of current research then I would strongly recommend COSM.	2004-06-28

But this is not just a giant monster book.  As Robert Price of Crypt of Cthulhu notes, Cerasini has taken these monsters and rid them of their taint of cartoonism.<br />This book continues the story of Godzilla who has appeared twice before (as seen in the movies Godzilla, King of the Monsters and Godzilla 1985).  Some asteroids that pass through our system every 65 million years are coming around again.  This time it looks like they will strike the Earth.  But the asteroids are not the only threat.  A Japanese research team has located Godzilla and he is awakening.  Resources are now split between dealing with the asteroids and speeding up production of defenses against Godzilla.<br />Soon the first of the asteroids arrive and new monsters are seen to walk the Earth.  A giant reptile crawls out of the Gulf of Mexico and terrorizes the Yucatan.  An asteroid fragment causes insects in Kansas to mutate horribly.  A researcher among the Alaskan Natives learns of a prophecy involving the Firebird.  The Earth Spirit tries to contact various humans to warn that Godzilla is an ally and the Destroyer of Life is coming.<br />This almost reads like an DC Comics' Otherworlds tale.  Imagine Rodan as the legendary Firebird or Mothra as the embodiment of the Earth Spirit.  While old monsters are seen in a new light, Cerasini delivers a fast-paced tale full of action.  If you enjoyed the old Japanese monster films you just might want to pick up this book and see the old monsters fresh as the day they were created.	2004-06-28

It is not.<br />Yes, Dallas is in danger of falling into a sinkhole, but that ir more of a subplot to the book.  The real story concerns US-Mexico relations.<br />In this book Mexico has turned Communist and is about to be backed by the Soviet Union (yes, this book was written in 1988).  Relations between the countries have been strained by the four-year drought that has seriously effected both countries and made the Rio Grande a point of contention.<br />After an image of the Madonna is found in a sinkhole, religion begins to play an important part.  Add some hot-headed military, nuclear weapons, nuclear deadlines, and a countdown to global Armageddon, what is going on in Dallas is barely touched upon.<br />The story takes place in the late 1990's when, according to a quick blurt near the end, we have put men on Mars and Venus and conquered almost all forms of cancer.  Oil dependancy is down as much of the country has converted to hydrogen use.  Not likely by 1988 standards.  the underground VTOL is a hoot as it flies through caverns where they are looking for footprints in the dust (which doesn't seem to ever blow away from the jets).<br />The pace of the book is pretty slow (especially the first 100 pages) but does pick up some near the end.  But it remains a threat of nuclear war story and not a natural disaster story.  I don't really know who this should appeal to most, but it wasn't me (and I usually like disaster books).	2004-06-25

But this is not just another Roswell or Area 51 story.  Harrison adds a new spin to the idea.<br />An intelligence officer at NORAD tracks four bogies one evening.  He and his partner record the tracks and alert their superiors.  Then the partner is transferred to Greenland where he dies in an airplane crash and the colonel will also be transferred if he doesn't use his leave time to retire a few weeks earlier than planned.  But colonel Hannon is now very suspicious and begins his own covert investigation.<br />He is eventually led to a testing site at Papoose Lake and the conclusion that the Secretary of Defense is unaware of what is going on in the secret facility.  He alerts the Secretary, a presidential hopeful in the coming election, but it is unknown just who can be trusted.  Hannon is on his own.  Almost.  He manages to put together a team, with the help of a letter from the Secretary, and carries out a raid on the facility.<br />The facility is breached and the government takes true control from the parallel cabinet that had been running it.  But Hannon never learns the true secret behind the facility, but the Secretary does and continues to keep it a secret.  This then climaxes in an ending I will not give away.<br />In this time of The X-Files and other mass-media exposures to UFO lore, Payne Harrison manages to remain a fresh voice while keeping to a believable premise (that is if you accept the existence of the aliens).  I heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in aliens, government cover-ups and the search for truth.  Check it out.	2004-06-24

Written mostly by Tella with only a small involvement by Anthony this is a tale straight out of Hindu mythology.  Two spirits, one female and pulchritudinous and the other male, crude and violent, form a wager as to the effectiveness of their methods.  They will each have seven chances to cause a chosen mortal's seduction or destruction.  The target is a young Brahmin who has decided to take a journey of discovery.<br />During the Brahmin's travels he becomes involved with nobles, the Rajah, powerful religious figures and many other interesting and colorful people.  Needless to say he is still alive at the end when he returns to his home village.<br />I do not pretend to be an expert on Hindu mythology and beliefs but the story seemed consistent and well researched.  The only flaw I found involved a pair of conjoined twins who were not identical (while possibly lifted from some Hindu tale it is scientifically impossible).  With the usual assortment of Arthurian and Medieval European fantasies stocking the shelves THE WILLING SPIRIT bings the same fresh approach that BRIDGE OF BIRDS did last decade.  While I hope I don't have to wait another decade for something similar, this one is well worth seeking out.	2004-06-24
616835:US	38672733	R1O3C6QFQEH8OG	0553578081	196979197	Wyrm	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Cyber Thriller Par Excellence	Last Sunday I read a surprisingly entertaining book by Mark Fabi titled WYRM.  Possible the best way to describe it would be as a cyber-thriller, but it has far more elements than that.  With the expected artificial intelligence, Internet and technology references, there is also a strong smattering of fantasy role-playing, Lewis Carroll, Monty Python and a plethora of modern cultural references.<br />WRYM is the story of Michael Arcangelo, a computer-virus hunter.  While checking into a possible virus at a chess tournament, Michael is first exposed to a virus of unheard of proportions.  An Internet-wide virus is out there and it may have developed intelligence.  It may also have bought into the idea that the Millennium will bring about the end of the world.<br />Michael assembles a crack team of programmers, cyber-theorists and technicians to try and stop the virus Wrym from causing a global disaster.  Through role-playing and some other techniques they draw nearer to the heart of the problem until a final all-out war involving the global hacker community ensues while Michael tries to make the final move toward victory.<br />I only had two minor problems with this book.  One, Fabi does not know where the term bug came from.  Secondly, I wonder at the wisdom of including a character referred to as Al in a story that uses the term AI as heavily as this one does.  Other than that, this is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  The book lures the reader in quite subtly.  I didn't really realize it until two-hundred pages had gone by.  The next thing I knew, I was four-hundred pages further along and the book was ending.<br />This book makes so many references and in-jokes that it could almost be considered a SILVERLOCK for the computer generation.  But even if you do not recognize every Python reference, recognize every famous programer or catch all of the other cultural and scientific references, you will still be able to enjoy this book.	2004-06-24

I found it to be otherwise.<br />The government is worried about the security of its transmissions.  As a result, all transmissions go through a coding box.  To test the new code a sample is run in certain genius magazines.  Enter one Simon, an autistic young man who likes puzzles.  He can decode the transmissions with ease.  That makes him a target for the agency that has spent millions and assured everyone that the code is unbreakable.  When a hit goes wrong a young FBI agent takes up the case and slowly unravels what is going on and tries to protect Simon.<br />The novel is set mostly in Chicago and is full of that sort of facts an author will use to prove they know the city.  Unfortunately they are almost all wrong.  Blatant errors ruin the pace of a suspense novel for me.  I also find them very irritating.  Then, of course, I had trouble reading the book without visualizing the movie trailer.  Bruce Willis plays a black man (at least in the book he is black and I see no reason to change it).  Simon is sixteen and not nine like in the movie.  The Willis character is also not really a hero.  He manages to protect the kid for about two days.  I am sure Willis had better luck.<br />Aside from the pacing that kept hitting speed bump errors, the book also suffers from overuse of inappropriate adjectives and adverbs.  It almost looks like the story was written and then pumped up with last minute descriptions.  Another sign of the book's quality is that it was originally released only a year ago under the title SIMPLE SIMON and it did not sell all that well (which makes for a lower-priced movie contract).  So go see the movie if you want to but stay away from the book.	2004-06-24

A young girl and her grandfather travel to the most spectacular sun in the galaxy to try and find a cure.  They travel using butterflies and sillyscience (I mean superscience).

I definitely got my money's worth with this one.  There is a little trouble with the time scale (a common problem in books and movies), but otherwise it was pretty good and enjoyable.<br />The title character throws a black-magic curse on a travel agent when her daughter commits suicide (it was supposed to be a hoax but wasn't).  The curse is in the form of a blob that goes around eating everything and assuming their shape.  It then pursues the travel agent across Asia and Africa.  The ending is obvious, but still, I enjoyed it.  A really good book if you like travel agents.	2004-06-23

When reading it, I was surprised at how absolutely nothing has changed since I last read the comic over a decade ago.  The Thing is still sullen.  Mr. Fantastic shows absolutely NO personality.  World geopolitical situations are amazingly unresearched.  Prince Namor (the backwards Roman) is his usual pompous self as he fends of an assassination attempt and coup staged by his cousin Byrrah (Harry B) and warlord Kreeg (the twisted Greek).  But behind the plot is Doctor Doom.<br />All the elements merge into an entertaining story that illustrates how the Marvel universe has a real tough time resolving situations.  Byrrah in his bid for the throne tries to have Namor killed.  Namor knows this.  Atlantean law says Byrrah must die.  But he doesn't.  Namor spares him so that he can be a menace later.  He is put under lifetime house arrest (we'll see how long THAT lasts).  Once again the world knows the evil of Von Doom and refuses to take action.  Like, he's dangerous, man.<br />Even the oddities of Atlantean history a brought forth.  Atlanteans who are not yet middle aged at seventy  still seem to change rulers as often as the shorter lived air-breathers (us).  Also, the Atlantean tendency to think and move in two dimensions, although they are free to move in three, somehow advances the plot.  At the end there is a great banquet where the FF cannot partake as they would have to remove their helmets.  Overall a silly but fun book.	2004-06-23

Seismic activity in the Antarctic causes a series of tsunamis to pound the West coast of North America (no mention of any effects anywhere else).<br />The United States is already in economic trouble and oil dependency is becoming a real problem.  Most of the story follows two separate groups of survivors and how they try and cope with the changed world.<br />I had two main problems with the book.  The first was that there was not adequate information given for the failure of the rest of the country.  The West Coast gets absolutely no help from the rest of the country and world.  The book is short enough that it could have stood some extra wordage.<br />The second problem was late in the book when there is cause for many buildings to collapse.  At this point in the story there is no electricity and no fuel (the abundance of wood mentioned at the start of the disaster seems to have dried up).  For some reason, when buildings collapse the almost immediately catch fire without electricity or gas to cause it.<br />The pacing of the book is a little slow although the action starts right at the beginning.  Big waves, ice ages, and greenhouse effects will remind many of the newer Day After Tomorrow, but the science in this one is much more firmly grounded in reality.  If you loved all of those Irwin Allen disaster pics you will probably get a kick out of this one.	2004-06-22

She also happens to be a vampire.  Her current consulting job with the Washington DC police has her on the track of a serial killer dubbed The Winter Man because he strikes during snowfalls.<br />Nicki's vampirism and that of her fellows (known as hematoman) makes for very interesting reading.  Few vampire tales have ever given plausible explanations for vampire physiognomy but this one does.<br />While reading the book it becomes obvious that the author was hoping to do more stories with these characters and her vampire society but this is the only one so far.  Vitola made a hit with her Ty Merrick werewolf stories instead (Quantum Moon, Opalite Moon, The Radon File, etc.).<br />The mystery is fairly well done although the final solution was rather cheap (but I won't give it away).  I was also a little disappointed to not find out why the Winter Man used snowstorms (a quick comment at the end lets us know that there must have been many more killings than were suspected).<br />All in all a pretty good book and I am sorry there are no more in the series.  But fans of the Ty Merrick tales should like this one.  Truly original.	2004-06-16

It is not.  There is not a single military person in the book and no helicopters (as pictured on the cover).<br />The story revolves around a quantum physicist who has just started a new department in the UN.  The department is Unit Omega, it has an annual travel budget of $1,000 and one salary.  Not much hope of getting anywhere until a mostly reputable scientist calls and claims to have seen the Loch Ness Monster.<br />Blowing the entire budget on a single trip, our hero enlists the aid of a science magazine writer and it is off to Scotland.  What is discovered next is totally unexpected.<br />In the depths of the Loch there is a quantum anomaly that, when properly prodded, can open a gateway to somewhere else.  Just where that somewhere else is may be speculated upon but it is not resolved.<br />The story moves quickly with many chapters ending in cliff hangers and teasers.  The writing is mostly solid (Jim Grand being a pseudonym) with only two blatant flaws.  The firs is that our hero sometimes stops talking like a trained physicist and starts talking like a military grunt.  The other flaw is less obvious unless you happen to have read about Loch Ness.  In this book the loch has a very low fish population (unless there was a sudden drop-off, Loch Ness supports more salmon than Lake Michigan).  But other than that I found the book to be quite entertaining.	2004-06-11

The small Indiana town of Town quickly becomes a place of horror when a boy dies mysteriously at the local dump.  Soon another body turns up dead in the same way but located indoors.<br />More bodies and finally a witness.  The deaths are caused by some sort of glowing green cloud.  But some of the deaths show signs of struggle.  Who struggles against a cloud?<br />As doctors and scientists race to find a cause and a cure, we eventually find out the whole truth of the horror.<br />I rather enjoyed this books as well as others by the collaborative team known as Pauline Dunn.  The one thing that bothered me was th authors' lack of naming the town.  An offhand remark at the beginning mentions that people simply refer to it as town so it really has no name.  But it has a Sheriff and industry so there must be an official name somewhere.  But it keeps being referred to as &quot;Town&quot; and it just reads oddly in some of the sentences.<br />But despite the lack of a town name the story is pretty well crafted.  It uses an interesting creation theory as part of the horror and combines with fast action and descriptive styles that actually change with the characters.<br />All in all a very entertaining little horror novel.	2004-06-10

I have always liked the original movie and have finally picked up the book.  This edition (mass market) has chanded the Introduction into an Afterward.<br />The book is thin and the plot is simple.  Joanna and her family have just moved to the town of Stepford.  The town is ruled by the Men's Club, a men-only organization that seems to be into everything.  The women are all happy homemakers.<br />Joanna, and her husband Walter, are all for women's liberation but they seem to have moved to a town as far removed from women's liberation as you can get.  Walter is planning to join the Men's Club and try and change it from the inside.  Joanna is going to try and get the other women in town interested in more than being housewives.<br />But Joanna only finds two other women willing to listen to her.  The rest are all too busy with housework and waiting on their husbands.  But then one of the two changes ans is suddenly super-housewife and has given up anything that does not help her husband.  Joanna and her last friend decide that something must be wrong with the town (i.e. toxic waste) that affects the women.  In the end Joanna discovers the truth about the town and tries to get away.<br />Joanna may have discovered the truth, but it is only hinted at in the book.  The reader will have to draw their own conclusion as to what really goes on in the town.<br />The story is fast and wraps around an interesting concept.  Unfortunately the writing and \\"facts\\" included in the story leave much to be desired.  The prose can be strangely and inaccurately descriptive (i.e. purpling breasts during a shower) and the details of Joanna's photography career bear little resemblance to reality.  Still, despite glaring errors and bad writing, the story does move well and is entertaining (although I think the errors might have been unbearable in a longer book).  If you have enjoyed the original film you will probably want to check this one out.	2004-06-01

Each of the stories is prefaced by a note explaining how the story came about and/or why it was included in the collection.  Because the stories are all by one author and were selected by him, the overall quality of the book is very consistent.<br />Other reviewers have listed the individual tales so I will not.  Most of the stories have a very dark element but not necessarily an element of the fantastic.  Most are very good at assaulting the right emotions but I was a little disappointed by the contents.  Having read other books by the author (i.e. Logan's Run and its two sequels as well as some short work), I was surprised at the almost cliched hack endings of some of the stories (the sort where the final paragraph reveals that the potman of the past twenty years is really a sentient radish from Vega).  I felt these particular endings to be a little cheap.<br />Although I was disappointed in some of the endings I was not disappointed by the writing style.  Mr. Nolan sets out to affect certain emotions and he succeeds ever time.  So if you want to be creeped out, have your hackles rise, or any of the other typical effects of Mr. Nolan's writing then this book is for you.	2004-06-01

This is the first book of Tiffany and the Mac Nac Feegle and I hope there will be plenty more.  The Scottish allusions and brogues are done to a T.

This knowledge puts him on a quest to reclaim his heritage.  There is talk of a family castle.  Considering the situation in Romania after the collapse of Russian Communism, the teacher thinks about turning the castle into an orphanage.  While pleading his case he enlists the aid of a young woman who tells him his claim will be processed more quickly if he claims he wants to start a hotel.  But the castle is very remote and the two are cut off for the winter.  Slowly the teacher learns the true heritage of his family.  A dark heritage involving the strigoi -- the undead (but not vampires).<br />The book is laid out as a collection of letters, journal entries and transcripts from taped logs.  This format actually adds additional depth to the story.  It sort of reminds me of the original The Books of Magic when the battle for the world happens off stage.  This book is a lot like that.  But remember, this is subtle horror.  If you are looking for blood, gore and body parts then this is not for you.  But if you like a classic style in a modern setting, then you should definitely take a look at this book.	2004-05-28

In the early part of the next century the Vice-President of the United States travels to the Moon to officially open Moonbase to coincide with a total eclipse of the sun.  During the phenomenon a comet is discovered heading our way from behind the sun.  The comet is of unprecedented size and is traveling orders of magnitude faster than any comet previously known.  Its trajectory will cause it to strike the moon and possibly shatter it.<br />As the catastrophe looms, occurs and continues in the aftermath, we are led through the decisions of a handful of people all over the country and in space.  Their tales of bravery are what make the book so enthralling.  The book does not move as quickly as say Armageddon but although there are times I would have liked for things to speed up a little the overall quality of the book would have suffered.  In the Big Things From Space sub-genre, MOONFALL is the best that I have read to date.  It is also the best Jack McDevitt book I have read to date.  This is a book I heartily recommend for anyone who likes straight science fiction (no fantasy elements whatsoever).	2004-05-28

This week I would like to review a book that hold a special place in my history.  I have read this book more times than any other.  When recommending it I tend to start reading it again.<br />This slim volume manages to grasp all of the finer points of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic series and turns them on their heads.  The book follows the adventures of Dildo Bugger as he journeys to destroy the ring he carries.  From the opening lines of the first chapter, It's My Party and I'll Snub Who I Want To, to Goodgulf's battle with the Ballhog all the way to the final destruction of the ring this book is one of the funniest I have ever read (and that includes The Tick).<br />BORED OF THE RINGS is currently available in a trade paperback edition.  If you enjoyed Tolkien's original and have a sense of humor I highly recommend that you locate a copy of this book and read it right away.  Your endorphin levels will thank you.	2004-05-28

In this book Jane Yolen weaves a tale of several worlds that all seem to border one another at an old mansion.  Different aspects of this mansion are inhabited by different aspects of the same young lad.  Soon magic begins to rise and the Wild Hunt is riding through the hills.<br />Led by a cat who is an aspect of the Summer Queen, the lad must rescue himself from Herne.  In doing so he learns the secret behind the Wild Hunt and the folly it represents.<br />This was an interesting and fresh telling of a classic legend.	2004-05-28
651462:US	38672733	R36RW82OY7LHHI	044100511X	565387739	News from the edge: insanity, illinois (X-Files)	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Weakest of the Three But Still Fun	This is the second book in the News From the Edge series starring reporter Savvy (Savannah McKinnon) Skye.  Savvy works for one of the supermarket tabloids to pay the rent while she tries to become a serious reporter.<br />Having been very successful on her first field assignment (field assignments are rare at her paper), Savvy is assigned to check out a small town in Illinois.  The paper's hotline received a number of calls from the town about a large variety of strange happenings.  During follow up calls no one in the town answered their phone.<br />Upon arrival to the town located on an island in the Mississippi, Savvy finds a town of lunatics.  Everyone that she runs into seems to be suffering from delusions of one sort or another.  Savvy suddenly finds her story of prank calls elevated to something far more important.  Soon she finds herself tracing down diseases, murders and nefarious plots as she tries to uncover the truth behind the madness.<br />As with many current mysteries, the main character's personal life and developments are as interesting as the rest of the story.  Savvy is trying to break into serious journalism.  She has found a mentor in the field and romance is beginning to bloom between the two.  Like its predecessor, THE MONSTER FROM MINNESOTA, this story is fresh and original.  The stories move quickly and are well plotted.  They are part urban fantasy, part mystery and part humor.  I definitely recommend this series as it should appeal to a wide audience and I hope Mark Sumner writes some more News From the Edge.	2004-05-28

Tolkien, H.P. Lovecraft and Piers Anthony I found it to be closer to Ray Bradbury and some Stephen King.<br />Good and Evil have fought many times.  Sometimes Good has won and sometimes Evil has.  The time is fast approaching for the one-thousandth battle.  A young boy will be the champion for Good.  He remembers all that has occurred in these battles of the past.  To prepare for his own battle he will have to find a teacher.  Then he will have to steel himself to face the champion of Evil which will take the form of that which he fears the most.<br />As this secret war develops in a small American town we are given small glimpses of how the town, and the world in general, are being affected by the struggle.  Eventually the final conflict occurs.  I will not say how the battle goes or what the representative of Evil is, you'll just have to read it.<br />PRINCE OMBRA, while being a tale of Good vs. Evil, is also an interesting look into history.  The book makes some very interesting points, including the true nature of Arthur and Excalibur.  I have recommended this book to quite a number of people over the years and all who took my advice enjoyed it.  It truly is one of the superior fantasy novels.	2004-05-28

The second of these is THE TRANSFIGURED HART.  Hunting season is about to begin and a white deer is spotted separately by to schoolmates.  One believes him to be a unicorn while the other believes him to be a white deer.  Soon the two discover that their secret is known by the other.  But the boy manages to convince the girl that the creature really is a unicorn and they must save it from the coming hunt.  <br />This is an interesting tale that has a white deer transformed by the power of belief into a creature of magic and legend.  A very entertaining, but short, tale of conviction and desperation.	2004-05-28
651871:US	38672733	R126XBW84VTFHV	0441004598	608850388	News from the edge: the monster of minnesota	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Introducing Savvy Skye	In keeping with the tradition of trying to alert readers to books they would probably overlook, this week I am recommending THE MONSTER OF MINNESOTA by Mark Sumner.<br />Billed as a cross between the Cat Who... books and the X-Files, this is the story of Savannah McKinnon, a writer for a notorious supermarket tabloid.  Although she works for a tabloid, Savvy wants to get into serious journalism.  When she gets a tip off the line about a lake monster that involves several deaths, Savvy goes out and does the almost unthinkable; she lands a field assignment.  But things don't go quite the way she had hoped.  First, her source turns out to be a kid.  Then other bits of the case go sour.  But there are still the bodies, the monster rumors, and a new chemical plant that seems to be killing of the fishing trade; a trade that keeps the town alive.  Slowly Savvy begins to put together the pieces and her chances or a serious story.<br />THE MONSTER OF MINNESOTA is the first in a series called News From the Edge.  The ending leaves plenty of room for Savvy to continue on her journalistic path.  This book is really a mystery with an element of the fantastic and written by an author who seems to understand the genres.  Savvy is a talented and interesting character.  As with a modern trend in mysteries Savvy has her sights set on an equally interesting man.  He runs a small weekly paper that she often submits articles to (which displeases her boss at the tabloid).  The two have an interesting relationship that promises further development if the series continues.	2004-05-28

Koontz if you are a traditionalist) is a book that only those who buy Koontz reflexively or those who have read/heard reviews would buy.  The book itself offers no clue as to what might be found inside.  But hidden between the covers is a rather entertaining tale.<br />On the anniversary of his family's death in a plane crash a man discovers that he is being watched by some sort of police or government agents.  At the family's grave site he meets a strange woman taking pictures of the site and is then interrupted by the watchers.  He discovers that they are from a pharmaceutical company and that they have planted a tracer on his car.<br />Slowly he becomes convinced that there was a survivor of the plane crash.  He finds evidence that she has visited with the families of other crash victims.  But for some strange reason these families wind up committing suicide shortly after her visits.  Her visits make them happy and convince them that their loved ones are o-kay.<br />He digs more deeply and finds that a lot of shady things have happened in connection with the crash and its investigation.  He is eventually led to the woman who did survive the crash.  But unlike the title suggests, there were two survivors.  The other was a young girl.  He then learns the truth behind their identities.  She had worked at a secret genetics lab and the girl was one of the results.  The project was trying to code for psychic abilities.  They had some success.  One was a boy who could take over a person's body.  He was the cause of the strange suicides.  The other was the girl.<br />This girl was unique.  She had an ability to tap into the other side.  She was proof of life after death and she could deliver that message in an instant.  But there are forces that are out to stop her from spreading the message.  The story climaxes with the man protecting the girl and hiding her so that she can grow to full power.<br />This is a good conspiracy story.  The evidence builds at a good rate.  Unfortunately, as with most stories of this type, there is no real resolution at the end.  Instead we know of things that are in motion and what could happen.  But since this is supposed to be the real world very little can be done to really alter things.  But it is still a good book and one that is hard to find out about.	2004-05-28

His mother has been restored to health (in the first book) and now he learns that his father might still be alive and a hostage of the Russian Mafiya.<br />Artemis puts his brains to work to rescue his father but is interrupted when he himself is kidnaped by Holly Short for interfering with Fairy business.<br />Well, Artemis is quickly cleared of the charges and a deal is struck.  Artemis will help Holly track down who is really trafficking with the goblins in return for help rescuing his father.  Sounds easy enough.  But there are plenty of plot complications thrown into the mix before each side manages to square the deal.<br />This is quite a different book from the first one.  When we were first introduced to Artemis, he was a criminal mastermind.  But now we see a different side to him as he quests for his father, helps out the underground fairy population and experiences much of life that privilege has shielded from him.  He is a much more likeable character now but possibly not as interesting.  Still, the plot is tight and the action fast.  Four-hundred pages flew by quite quickly.  Not quite the same as the first, but I still recommend it.	2004-05-19

I refer to Megan Lindholm's WIZARD OF THE PIGEON.  At a convention panel on magic, it was suggested that there were no mixes of magic and socialism in fantasy literature.  I brought up this book as possibly the only socialistic treatment of a magic system (at least outside of a socialist country).<br />The book centers around the title character who is a street person.  Apparently everyone with magic ability is a street person.  Everyone's magic is different and none is better of worse than another.  There is no one in charge.  You just go to the person who can do what you need.  The story sets up the characters and the world setting very nicely and quickly.  Then our protagonist becomes hunted by a horrible monster.<br />I will leave it to the reader to determine if the story has a happy or sad ending.  I personally found the ending to be rather sad.  Whatever you decide, it is a very enjoyable and though provoking urban fantasy in a slender volume and I recommend it to anyone who can handle the concept of magic in a modern setting.	2004-05-18

The strength of Resnick's work makes that quite a compliment.  Fans of Resnick's science fiction will really enjoy this book.<br />Xavier William Lennox is a writer specializing in exposes of alien cultures.  On Medina, he went too far to observe a sacred ritual and is brutally tortured to the edge of death.  While recuperating, the Office of Alien Affairs tells him he has a chance to go back.  They can surgically transform him into a Medinan.  He goes.  Now he can study Medina more closely than any culture he has seen before.<br />Being a Medinan does not give full understanding however.  Lennox leaves but is fascinated with his alien body.  Now continuing to work for the Office of Alien Affairs, lennox is given new bodies.  Each one has its strong and weak points.  And each one takes Lennox further from his humanity.  Each change is less satisfying, but returning to human would be unbearable.  Lennox continues to sink lower until he finally finds a place for himself.  This book is aptly subtitled A Tragedy of Trancendance.  And a tragedy it is, but a fascinating tragedy.  I strongly recommend this book.	2004-05-18
663185:US	38672733	RRL1EB0IU1B6R	0671720759	593817987	A Bad Spell In Yurt	Books	4	4	4	N	N	The Wizardry is Afoot	The Royal Wizard of Yurt series by C. Dale Brittain is an entertaining one.  The first book is called A BAD SPELL IN YURT and stars the young wizard Daimbert.<br />Daimbert has just barely graduated from the wizard's school but he manages to find a post as royal wizard in the tiny kingdom of Yurt.  In this world, only recently have wizards been taught in a school.  Previously the apprentice program was the way to wizardly learning.  Also strong in this world is the Christian church (although this is otherwise not really Earth).<br />In Yurt the young Daimbert (who is dyeing his beard grey) is commissioned to set up telephones and magic lights.  But the real reason he was hired was not for minor luxuries, but because a spell is killing the king.  Daimbert must analyze the spell, seek help from his predecessor, befriend the local chaplain and convince an evil demon to leave his world.<br />The story is paced like a mystery with the reader finding things out as Daimbert does and trying to solve the puzzles of the plot.  Although many scenes are light-hearted, this is not a comedy series.  t is, however, a very good read and I recommend it for fans of fantasies with a bit of mystery and magic.	2004-05-18

I found this to be a fascinating tale of future and alternate history.<br />Josh is a longtimer.  That means that every sixteen years he gets sick for six months and drops ten years of aging.  He also drops most of his recent memories.  Josh has just woken up on Mars and is trying to piece together his past involvement with the KGB and the Committee.  Josh lived through and participated in some very violent and wildly changing times.  Earth gets abandoned to AIs that make backup copies in humans, limited time travel has been discovered and man is exploring space.  Through Josh's 140 years of life we see a fascinating history unfold beginning in the 1960's to the not very distant future.<br />This is a fun book if you like history.  Bush gets a second term and dies of mutAIDS (an airborne variety), Yeltsin conducts a failed coup on international television and plenty of other historical quirks.  The only problem is that there is not much in the way of plot.  The title only becomes significant at the very end.  So what you have is a forty or fifty page story interspersed among an interesting history.<br />This is one in a series of books dealing with the Memes (the Ais).  Others include Candle, Orbital Resonance, and The Sky So Big and Black.	2004-05-18

This one is called Speeding Bullets and is told by Superman's closest associates.  The main idea is that they are convinced that he is the man he is because of where his ship landed, his parents, the influence of Lois Lane and other factors.  Only this combination could result in superman.  Right?<br />Kal-El's craft crashed and spotted by a childless couple who returned to their house and treated the boy as their own son.  These people are Dr. and Martha Wayne.  Kal-El manages to burn the mugger who kills his parents, but not before he discovers he is bullet proof.  He represses the memories and eventually becomes a heartless vigilante known as Batman.<br />Bruce Wayne comes out of hiding and enters the newspaper business by hiring the best; out of work Perry White, Lois Lane and others.  The first big story is Lex Luthor's move to Gotham.<br />Lex Luthor gets to play the part of three separate villains all rolled into one but I won't tell you who or how the heartless Batman becomes Superman, but it was a very entertaining story.	2004-05-18

Sprague de Camp, one of the masters of the time travel story once wrote a story called A Gun For Dinosaur staring Reginald Rivers and his time safari.  Almost thirty-five years later he began writing more stories about Mr. Rivers and dinosaur hunting.  These stories were collected into a volume called RIVERS OF TIME.<br />These stories begin in much the same way with Reginald Rivers explaining company policy to a new client.  Rivers then proceeds to narrate a tale of a previous safari to explain his point.  The other common thread is that while being surrounded by dinosaurs of all shape and sizes, the real trouble and danger comes from the people.<br />The first story, A Gun For Dinosaur, was slightly rewritten to bring it more up to date with accepted dinosaur knowledge and theory.  One story even has a client wanting to witness the meteor strike that wiped out the dinosaurs while another has a religious team trying to disprove evolution.<br />So, if you like time travel, dinosaurs and good human interaction, try and pick up this collection.	2004-05-18

In this book, Baxter flawlessly combines many great SF themes.  Victorian exploration, super science, alternate history, and the personal accounts of a minor functionary made this a delight for me to read.<br />The industrial revolution has come a little early and in an unexpected form.  An Antarctic expedition finds a substance called anti-ice.  So dubbed because if it starts to warm up, it releases incredible amounts of energy.  Thus evolves a British empire like you have never seen.  Imagine all the great creations of Verne being controlled by the British and available to the common man.  Anti-ice becomes the new fuel of the empire.  Its discoverer continually finds new ways to use its power.  One such method was to power a flying rocket that he travels the world in.  But after some sabotage, he finds himself in space and headed for the moon.<br />Besides fueling the empire, anti-ice can also be a terrible weapon.  And wouldn't you know it, Bismarck is on the march and the French are out to stop him.  Look out!  If you like alternate history of the great voyages of Verne, this is a book for you.	2004-05-18

BY THE SWORD by Timothy Boggs was the better of the two.  THE EMPTY THRONE by Ru Emerson was not quite as enjoyable.<br />Having seen Xena rescue the arc of the Covenant, Defend Troy, save Helen and meet Homer, Xena goes to Ithaca and gets involved in the Odyssey (Homer is still a young boy and has never met any of the heroes).  Unfortunately it lacked the fun and silliness that runs throughout the series.  Although I do like the way Homer was in diapers at the start of the Trojan war.  Really.<br />I had hoped that books based on the series would get better with time (like they did with Star Trek) but there were only a few and now the series has ended.  Oh, well.  If you really liked the show, you should probably skip this one.  Ru Emerson is a talented writer but the nuances of are just not her style.	2004-05-18

This is hard science fiction at it's best.  The novel comprises a number of cautionary tales and thumbs its nose at Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov.<br />The book opens with relativistic bombs wiping out almost all life in the solar system.  Relativistic bombs are missiles (just chunks of rock, really) that have been accelerated to a significant portion of the speed of light.  Carl Sagan has stated that any advanced civilization that does not destroy itself becomes peaceful.  THE KILLING STAR claims otherwise.  I do not recommend this book to anyone that has paranoid tendencies.  It is well written and frightening.  So clearly frightening that it reminded me of THE HOT ZONE which is nonfiction.<br />Most of the book follows the few survivors scattered across the solar system and their efforts to survive after the cataclysm.  Many interesting scientific studies and theories are brought up muck like in a goor Arthur C. Clarke novel.<br />So why do aliens try and wipe us out?  Michael Jackson wrote a song about unity.  Hordes of artists sang it.  In 1985 every radio station on the planet broadcast it simultaneously.  The song was We Are The World and the broadcast was the single &quot;loudest&quot; shout sent by us into space.  Think about the song's message and the way it was broadcast.  Read this book.	2004-05-18

This book was released several years ago but is still available here on Amazon.<br />Krutons are shape changing slime molds.  They are also all lawyers.  Now they have a plot to sue the Human race and only one ship of the line stands in their way; the USS Repulse.  The Repulse has a new captain, Captain David Wanker (Vahn-ker) and a crew made up of the worst in the service.  Wanker and crew must escort Rufus T. Strangefinger to the Kruton Interface to test a new interstellar drive.<br />This book shamelessly pokes fun at Star Trek, Star Trek: Next Generation, the Marx Brothers and just about everything else (including itself).  If you are looking for a really silly book filled with good satire then try and find a copy of this book.	2004-05-18

What is unusual is his involvement with a certain man in a bat costume.  Yes, another Elseworlds Batman story in the world of Gotham By Gaslight.<br />This story is narrated by Houdini.  An interesting twist has been added to Batman lore.  If Houdini is a contemporary, then Wayne could not study his posthumous writings.  Thus Batman is not very good at picking locks or making escapes.  I do not want to give away the plot other than it involves missing children and a very interesting twist on the Joker (who shows up in style but not name).  It also adds an interesting twist to the life of Houdini, a man who spent a great deal of time debunking the supernatural.	2004-05-18

This book is different form his other works.  It is not the star-flung adventure of the Starrigger books, light fantasy of the Castle series or even the suburban fantasy of MAGICNET.  No, INNERVERSE is more 1984 disguised as WALDEN TWO, or something like that.<br />Enter Special Operative Frank.  He has been assigned to enter the Federation, the old Eastern portion of the United States.  Twenty years previously all communication was cut off and all attempts to discover what is going on have failed.   Satellites show active cities but no air transportation.  The secret is Innerverse, a nanotechnology for regulating behavior.  Microscopic machines in your blood stream and other areas that condition you against negative emotions, thoughts and impulses.  Frank discovers a society without any apparent leaders or government.  People just follow their orders and go about their lackluster days with no thought of the future.  Frank needs to report back on his findings but he has been given Innerverse and it prevents thoughts of leaving.<br />What follows is a series of tense actions mixed with social commentary and several interesting characters.  If you are looking for something resembling a previous DeChancie novel then don't look at this one.  For those looking for an interesting suspense story or a nanotech story then you should take a look at this one.	2004-05-18

BY THE SWORD by Timothy Boggs was the better of the two.  <br />The humor level was very close to the show and the dialog could have been lifted straight from a script.  But hey, that's what we expect from Boggs.  I do enjoy all of the little things that are wrong in the series (especially the snachronisms both intentional and unintentional).  In this one Hephaestos is about to blow his stack and cause a volcano.  That's what Hercules calls it.  Pity the volcano was named after Vulcan (the later Roman god) and not Hephaestos (the Greek god).<br />If you have enjoyed the show and its particular brand of humor and action, you will find this volume to be full of it.	2004-05-18

Now I have just completed the sequel called THE GOBLIN'S REVENGE by Dean Wesley Smith.<br />This book takes up just after the conclusion of the first book.  Spider-Man has just turned over a deadly serum to Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four.  Reed is attacked by a pumpkin-bomb wielding figure who takes the serum.  Then someone helps Carnage break out of prison and there are sightings of The Green Goblin (who has been dead for years).  The Green Goblin, Carnage and a team from the company that created the serum are now all after Spider-Man.  To make matters worse, Spidey is not in top form as nightmares have kept him from sleeping.  Now he must figure out the riddle of the Green Goblin's return, recapture Carnage and avoid the team with the fancy ray guns.<br />I really enjoyed the first book as it really felt like it was directly from the pages of the comic book, but this one just did not flow as well.  It might be that Dean Wesly Smith was only a co-author of the first one while he is the only author of this one.  So, while I recommended the first to people on the basis that it read just like a single issue of the comic, I do not really recommend this one.  If you want to read it anyway go right ahead, it is kind of fun in its way.	2004-05-18

The novel is AGGRESSOR SIX.  This is a novel of alien contact and war.  What makes it different from others of a similar theme is that physics actually plays a part.  The aliens have a huge empire (still just a spot on the map) that has existed for eons.  Long enough for the forces of the spiral arm to have stretched and split the collection of worlds.  Lo and behold, almost next door they run into humanity which is also attempting to expand into the stars.  The aliens attack and humanity loses.  Word gets out to Earth that the aliens are on their way.  <br />It will be many years before they arrive.  Many plans are hatched to try and deal with the aliens who have reached humanity's furthest settlement and wiped it out.  One of these plans is to train soldiers to live and think like the aliens and thus hopefully come up with a way to turn the invaders aside.  This is called an aggressor six; a six-member group that is at once a colony and a family.  They train and train.  Later they find out that they are only one of three sixes.  The other two are a six of dolphins and a six of machine AIs.  The dolphins kill some researchers and it is decided that the plan does not work.  But the humans are close.  The machines are VERY dangerous if you say the wrong thing to them, but the machines understand the aliens.  The aliens are getting closer (still a year or so away from Earth).<br />This is a novel that does an excellent job of creating alien aliens.  Not just strange, but plausible in their own right.  A wonderful book for fans of hard SF.	2004-05-18

Leo has been summoned for a big Whitelighter gathering.  That leaves Piper alone to deal with complete chaos as both her home and her nightclub are in danger from workmen.<br />But when an armload if spices falls onto some charms, Piper is accidently wished into two.  Although unintentional, Piper one and Two see the advantages of being in two places at once.  But danger rears its ugly head as the Darklighters band together for the first time in many years.<br />Having Piper split in to is a classic move but it was not handled well.  I was not convinced that half of Pipers traits went to each version.  In fact both seem rather selfish for much of the time.<br />This could have been a pretty good story but there just wasn't enough work done either on the details of the character histories (the first season or two seem completely ignored).  Far from the best of the Charmed books but also not the worst. I would put this one firmly in the middle somewhere.	2004-05-17
665248:US	38672733	R73SKN4ALFJD8	0451411382	166211060	Dust of Eden	Books	2	1	3	N	N	EC Comics Live Again	The old classic horror comics were filled with stories of art that comes to life.  That theme is used in this novel.  In the Mid-East there is a small guarded crater.  It is filled with a red dust.  Legend has it that people from the stars came and created man and that the dust is a residue left behind.  Some of this dust is stolen for the sole reason that it is guarded.  A sample winds up in a funeral urn and is forgotten for many years.<br />The urn is in the hands of an old widow looking to commit suicide.  For some reason she decides to paint one last painting and mixes some of what she thinks are her husbands ashes into the paint.  The picture is a portrait of her paralyzed daughter long before her accident.  Too tired to follow through on the suicide, she goes to sleep and is awakened by her now-young daughter.<br />The old woman puts suicide on a back burner and decides, instead, to paint other portraits of people missing from her life.  Years later they are living with her on her old farm which is disguised as an assisted living facility.<br />Enter our protagonist, a professor trying to deal with a father losing his memories.  For some reason he thinks the farm is a good place for his father and forces him in.<br />The farm is a strange place.  The father is the only one who does not belong, not having been painted to life by the old woman.<br />What follows is really not all that interesting.  The young girl steals some paint and accidentally creates some soulless monsters.  Another of the resurrected is convinced by a voice from the other side to paint the serpent in a painting of Eden.  The old woman becomes somewhat power-hungry when she realizes that the risen will not act the way she would like the to.<br />In the end very little is resolved.  One has to wonder where all of the monsters are now (I suppose a sequel is possible).  But ultimately I found myself wondering what the point was.  We learned very little about most of the characters and those that we did learn about were not interesting.  The father-son story could have worked better if the son had some rationale for sticking his father in the farm (he never checked medical facilities or anything else that a supposedly caring son would want to know).  The one thing the son does seem to know is that the farm is not all above board (so why does he put his father there?).  The reverse Dorian Gray idea was a little interesting but never developed in a satisfying way.<br />I do not recommend this book to horror or suspense fans.  I found it an actual chore to read (the made-up words didn't help).	2004-05-17

The book is AS ONE DEAD by Don Bassingthwaite and Nancy Kilpatrick.  Nancy should not be a stranger to most.  The book is set in the world of White Wolf's Vampire: The Masquerade and the title comes from Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET.  As the title might suggest, there is a love story and plenty of tragedy.  This isn't bad news sort of tragedy, this is bad things happening to characters that I found I actually cared about.  Not many books have managed to pull off tragedy for me (ROMEO AND JULIET did not), but this one surprisingly did.<br />What's it about?  Well...  Toronto is under the control of the Sabbat clan.  They defeated the Camarilla and took over.  The remaining Camarilla have been confined to an eight-block area called The Box.  They are not allowed out and the Sabbat are not allowed in.  Enter Biana who enters the box claiming that the outside Camarilla want to rejoin those in The Box.  Can she convince them?  What are her motives?<br />The plot was more complex and better laid out than in many books I have read recently.  Take a look at it, you just might be as surprised as I was.	2004-05-06

Philip used to have a good job at Micromeg.  Unfortunately Philip lost his job after preventing the Old Ones from jumping into our space and time.  Philip's ex-girlfriend (who's life he claims to have saved) thinks he is crazy.  His coworkers think he is crazy.  The institutions he has been in think he is crazy.  Even his therapist believes this.  But Philip knows he is sane and that all of the monsters of H.P. Lovecraft are real.  The reader is made to side against Philip.  Ah, but what if Philip is NOT crazy?  There is the little matter of...  But that would be telling.  Suffice it to say, Mythos fans SHOULD read this book.  You know who you are.<br />This is a well-written book (as well as any mythos book).  My only problem with the book is that I kept thinking Philip was younger.  Mid-twenties perhaps.  Otherwise, it is a very enjoyable, and fast, 500 page read.  I do recommend this one.	2004-05-06
679587:US	38672733	R3V8JRNM5DD6FQ	0613068122	583192728	Exegesis	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Enter EDGAR	EXEGESIS by Astro Teller is a new entry into the classic tales of super computers and smart programs that seem to get a little out of control.  The entire novel, except for the introduction and epilogue, is in the form of e-mail messages.  Using letters to tell a tale is not a new idea.  Two excellent examples are Helene Hanff's 84 CHARING CROSS ROAD, subject of an excellent film, and DADDY LONG LEGS which inspired the Fred Astaire movie of the same name.<br />In this novel we follow the work of Alice Lu, a student working on her doctoral thesis.  From the first message, the two simple words, Hello, Alice!, we slowly learn about Alice's project EDGAR, a program meant to read news groups, analyze the information and send messages to Alice.  Until that simple two-word message all Alice had received from EDGAR was garbage.  Alice first suspects a joke but slowly learns that somehow her modifications to the project have caused it to become self-aware.<br />Once the truth dawns on Alice she scrambles to keep EDGAR a secret until she can recreate the experiment.  Because EDGAR has been posting to news groups Alice disconnects the system from the outside world.  EDGAR quickly runs out of things to read and asks for more.  Alice feeds EDGAR a few disks while trying to recreate the experiment on a host of other machines.  No luck.  Even worse, the Ethernet cable gets reattached and EDGAR flees the system.  Now Alice has no proof other than her communications.<br />As EDGAR continues to read all that it can, it manages to catch the attention of the FBI and the NSA.  Alice, whose personal life is one of the worst, becomes very afraid and begins thinking of dropping out of school.  EDGAR is the only thing keeping her going, even after EDGAR becomes trapped in an NSA machine.  In the end Alice is a broken woman and EDGAR has disappeared from the NSA machine.  Did it escape or did Alice's talk of suicide cause it to end itself?  We don't know.<br />While I enjoyed this book I hadtwo problems with it.  At first I wondered what a true AI was doing using the ultra slow method of communication called e-mail.  This was shortly explained in a way that made sense to me so it was not a problem.  The first main problem I had was the overall format.  The novel is passed off as truth-written-as-fiction.  In other words the events happened but with no proof it had to be released as fiction.  Not a real problem except that the author set the story just a few years in the future.  Had it been made contemporary it would have had a bigger impact.  The second problem was that the book was not leaked by Alice, as she hinted earlier in the book, but by the NSA who says they will keep the story quiet.  Other than that it was a great book so keep an eye out for it.	2004-05-05

Holmes, Plain and Simple	This is the latest in Rick Geary's series A Treasury of Victorian Murder.  Many people have become fascinated with H. H. Holmes thanks to the book The Devil And The White City.  But unlike that book, this is not a dramatization.  Instead it is a simple chronological account of the man based on what little evidence actually exists.<br />Not a whole lot is know about Dr. Holmes, much is supposition and here say.  Geary does an excellent job of recounting the facts as well as highlighting many inconsistencies in the legend (i.e. at one point Holmes admitted to the murder of 27 people but some of them were still alive).<br />Although Geary's series is written in a comic book format, this is not really a comic book.  The reader is drawn in quickly and then the story is presented in a very clear and straightforward manner.<br />Whether this is your first account of Holmes or your tenth, I am sure you will find the story fascinating.	2004-05-04

The girls are on break and getting ready to return to school at a new level (10th).  The new level brings thoughts of growing up and maturity.<br />As Izzie wants more responsibility, she shows it in a very odd way.  She becomes a rebel and rather untrustworthy as she becomes unable to easily handle a more-adult world.<br />Drinking, drugs and body piercing become Izzie's new pastimes as well as a new boy named Josh.  Tempers flare between her and her mother as she gets more out of control.  But in the end all is well and Izzie is able to turn her back on her evil ways.<br />This is the oddest story in the series so far.  While Izzie faces some very real issues in this story, her sudden reversal at the end is rather unbelievable.  It is also typical that the girls are close mates except when boys are concerned.  Once a boy enters the picture one will never believe the others about him.	2004-05-03

Many people feel that Steve Perry is turning out a few too many books lately and therefore his quality is down.  If that is so then this is the exception.<br />The Story concerns a mysterious silver box.  The box will answer almost any question asked of it.  It will even predict the future.  The box appeared in a temple and a courier was hired to take it to the main temple.  Needles to say, things get a bit sticky.  A number of people want the box.  Then it splits itself into three parts and each main player has one.  Each piece will tell where the others are.  What follows is well paced and well written.<br />If you pick up the book because of the blurb on the back, you might be a little disappointed that the properties of the box are not mentioned for the first half.  But the story works.  There is also a steamy sex scene that actually advances the plot.  How many times have you seen that happen?  Go ahead, take a look at it.	2004-05-03

True, it does star a twelve year old but that is the only real reason to think of it as a juvenile.  After all ROMEO AND JULIET could be thought of as a juvenile for similar reasons.  The book is a narrative by said twelve year old.  It starts off a bit crude, just like a boy would write and quickly improves as he better learns his word processor and gets tips from his English teacher.<br />The plot centers around his family and two aliens who come to live with them.  While the overall tone remains light this was not intended as a kids book.  Kinds can certainly enjoy it, but the subtlety might be lost on them.  The story ties in humorous and insightful dealings with the supermarket press, UFO watchers, UFO researchers, science fiction writers, galactic empires, family values and talk shows.  It is almost a book about modern society, but remains a tale of suburban science fiction that takes a pointed look at the world we live in.	2004-05-03

Lindsay.  The cover labels the book as a Novel of the UFO Cover-up.  As such it involves Area 51 and the events at Roswell some forty years ago.<br />Some forty years ago a spacecraft crashed on a small farm in Roswell.  The government moved in and confiscated everything.  The wreck and the surviving crew were held by the Government.  Aliens and humans worked together with the aliens providing new technology and the humans helping to repair the ship.  Much of the non-linear developments of the last forty years are a result of this cooperation.  But now things are coming to an end.  The ship is almost complete and the military does not want to lose this source of technology.  Hidden agendas abound among the main players in a chess-match like series of moves and countermoves, all leading to the book's conclusion.<br />A well-written tale that manages to bring in just about all of the serious UFO research.  We learn very little about how the aliens think (a plus as they remain more alien) except for dream sequences where a character observes through an alien's eyes.  If you like UFO stories that don't get all hokey but stay in the realm of known science, then you will probably enjoy this book.	2004-05-03

This is a subtly disturbing story about a private in the armed forces who is accidentally stuck in the nut bin after striking an officer.  Another officer asks the head psychiatrist to expedite matters and get the man out of there.<br />The story is told in a series of documents.  First a couple of letters and then a journal detailing the private's life to date.  Slowly a true picture of George, as he is referred to in the third person in the journal.  Who is this man?  How does he think?  How does he react?  These are questions that are slowly answered as George is interviewed and tested.<br />The story is very cleverly written in that all you need to know is at the beginning of the book but you don't recognize it for what it is.  Wording is chosen with extreme care to convey just the right meaning.  I am glad that this book was originally released in 1961 and was written by someone like Sturgeon.  Written today by someone else and the subtlety would be gone and we would have an explicit shocker.  I highly recommend this story to any who enjoy delving into the mind.	2004-05-03

One such book is called ARMED MEMORY by Jim Young.  This book is a near-future techno-thriller that I found quite engrossing.<br />The time is the end of the twenty-first century and genetic research has progressed to the point of allowing cosmetic changes at the genetic level.  A virus is created that over time will alter your DNA so that you look like Marilyn Monroe, Elvis or a wolfman.  Scientist/artists create new designs for the public.  At some time in the past a design was created for hammerheads.  Part man and part shark.  This was a design very popular in the underworld.  Now large gangs of hammerheads are a threat to security world wide.<br />The story is told in a series of testimonies given after the hammerhead disaster.  Hammerheads are violent, go on killing frenzies, can hide in the ocean and have the ability to communicate over long distances.  Now they want to wipe out all life on land and return to the sea.  Their communications ability allows them to access and program computers from a distance.  Nuclear holocaust is narrowly averted.<br />The world as seen in the book is one that could be possible.  This is one of the things that makes the book so effective.  If you can find a copy (released last month) I recommend reading it if science-fiction techno-thrillers are your style.	2004-05-03

I was very pleased with Rovin's treatment of Lovecraft's Re-Animator, so I gave this on a try.<br />This is not a novelization of the movie, but the story before the game.  This novel introduces all of the characters who star in the game.  Their histories.  The origin of and special powers they may possess.  Other than having to work in the horrible title of Mortal Kombat (misspellings included) I found it to be a well-worked and plotted story.<br />Deeply rooted in Chinese legend and mythology, this is a story of gods and their mortal servants and supporters.  Added to this culturally rich setting is just a tasteful pinch of insider humor from many sources.  For example, one of the heroes hails from a small town called Jackiechan.  While this reference is rather blatant, the others are more subtle and blend into the story better.  There is little actual fighting in this story.  Apparently Rovin felt there was enough in the game.  The one thing that really separates it from the game is that the good guys go out of their way not to kill.  If they did kill they would be no better than the bad guys (who are plotting and other dimensional invasion).<br />Like I said, this book is fun, fast-paced, entertaining and well written.  It is definitely worth a look-see.	2004-05-03

Much of this book concerns their custody fate now that they have been freed and revealed to the world.<br />Frannie and Kit want to adopt the children but there is a strong case for their biological parents to have custody (I didn't recall them knowing who they were).  As the battle continues, a test period is set up to see what solution is really best.<br />But soon the calm is shattered.  Max apparently knows something about people worse than those at The School.  If she tells anyone she will be killed.  But two-thirds of the book concerns what she knows about something called The Hospital, Resurrection, and attempts to capture and/or silence her and the other children.<br />The story is fast paced and the Lake House only enters the picture in the epilogue.  I still find the children themselves completely unbelievable despite the author's assurances that it is possible.  Max has a wingspan of 10 feet.  A swan has 8 feet and weight 30 pounds.  An albatross has 11 feet and weighs 18 ponds.  Considering the children have no tails and are larger than these two birds, their wings would have to be much larger.  There is also no explanation as to their strength, genius, or why the doctor wants them.  I suppose there is always a chance of another book.<br />But if you like the first book (When the Wind Blows) then you will probably enjoy this one as well.	2004-05-03

Like its predecessor, this volume treats magic as religious and therefore tries not to explain or rationalize certain events.<br />Bast's beliefs are based on Gardnerism which gained its start earlier this century.  Although Gardner claimed to have based the rituals on older sources, no historical evidence has been found to support this claim.  But in this book someone has uncovered a Book of Shadows that purportedly belonged to Mary, Queen of Scotts.  Certain forces would like to have this book and Books of Shadows are being stolen, Mary's among them.  The plot escalates as murders are committed and Bast is drawn into the conflict.<br />This book holds up well as a mystery, is light on the fantasy and does some interesting explorations into history.  Although this volume was billed as a mystery, all of the references and in jokes point to an intended science fiction audience.  I still find it worth reading.	2004-04-28

Although his money troubles have been lessened by his payment in the previous adventure, his troubles are far from over.  Walker has asked him to look in on some sabotage at a local power company.  But things do not go as planned and the case's resolution has repercussions throughout the rest of the book.<br />While hiding from Walker, John gets hired to look into a rising singing star.  Her father wants to make sure she is alright.  What should be a simple case is not.  The singer's songs seem to be able to drive people to suicide.  Her managers are a very mysterious pair wielding a lot of power.  The power company case is still sending ripples through everything.<br />There is a lot for John to resolve and even more to just plain survive.  John battles some of his worst foes and we see a return of the Harrowing.  But in the end John manages to put things as right as they can be.  After all, he IS John Taylor.<br />A fast and well-paced story with a little more depth to the subplots (which aren't so sub).  A few surprises can be seen from far away but others pop up out of the blue.  This is the second best book in the series so far.  Unfortunately the volume is padded with nearly 30 pages of a preview of Dead to the World by Charlaine Harris.	2004-04-28

SPEAK DAGGERS TO HER by Rosemary Edghill was one of the earlier efforts.  This is the first of a series of mysteries staring Bast the witch.<br />If you happen to have any knowledge of Wicca, Neo-Paganism, Gardnerian and all of the rest you should get a kick out of this book.<br />Bast is called by a friend and fellow coven member when a mutual friend dies.  While handling all of the details Bast comes across some inconsistencies.  Miriam, who we never see alive, recently joined a Russian based sect that boasts that their power struck her down when she tried to abandon the group.  Bast investigates further and gets drawn into the sect.<br />There are two reasons that this book can be considered cross-genre.  The first is that only a science fiction fan will get all of the science fiction jokes, plugs, analogies and whatnot the pepper the book liberally.  The other is the element of magic.  Because it is talked about in religious terms it is left to the reader to decide whether magic or coincidence plays a role in the events.<br />Rosemary Edghill is both a mystery and a fantasy author.  However, I have one small problem with the book.  While Bast continually uses science fiction references there is absolutely no mention of her reading or watching the stuff.  Other than that I found it to be a very enjoyable book.  You will probably find it in the mystery section although the spine is unlabeled.	2004-04-28

Here we have a good biography of Neil Armstrong, first man to set foot on the moon.  The book appears to be well-researched and credited.<br />Unfortunately, the publisher did not do as much work as the author.  This is immediately obvious by the photo of Buzz Aldrin on the cover.  There is a tiny image of Neil Armstrong reflected in the faceplate, but the main image is Aldrin.  Aldrin's name tag is clearly visible through the &quot;A&quot; in the word GIANT.<br />But if you can ignore having the wrong man on the cover, the insides are worth reading.  Neil's adventure is one of the great achievements of the last fifty years and has had far too little actually written about the men themselves.<br />This is a wonderful addition to the library of any fan of the space race.	2004-04-27

Second, the murders of three scientists and their mysterious connections to each other.  But, foremost is a strange weed in her yard that puts her husband in the hospital and seems to be the precursor to incredible instant forests that grow up almost overnight, taking over suburbs and returning them to the wild.<br />Alternating with this is an Arabian Nights-like adventure of an orphaned storytelling teenager turned slave to a Sultan.  She is Opal-Ears and, disguised as a boy, is sent with the Sultan's son on a mysterious journey in search of a key that will stop The End of Everything.  Along the way, several others join the travelers (in typical quest fashion) as we learn more about the cultures along Opal-Ears's route.<br />Tepper throws in a number of surprises throughout the second half that will amuse the reader (including a few seeming jabs at a popular family film from a couple of years back) while environmentalist and feminist issues are unobtrusively discussed.<br />If good characterization, strong female leads and a plot that keeps you guessing are what you like, this will more than satisfy you.	2004-04-27

It was an entertaining novel but nowhere near as polished as Tepper's latest.<br />Keelie is a young woman who is born as an adult; built from the bodies of three others.  While some early references are made to The Bride of Frankenstein, that image is quickly dispensed with.  Keelie begins to remember things from her donor's lives.  To find out more she visits their families and begins a journey that covers thousands of years of the history of women.<br />Ancient Sumerian myths play an important role as Keelie searches through past lives for answers.  Clever observations of the world mesh themselves into the story as Keelie comes closer and closer to discovering her true heritage.  The goddess Eriskegal is the force enabling Keelie to live out parts of her past lives.  In each scenario the same characters are played out over and over.<br />While entertaining I was a bit put off by the similarity in they way everyone talked.  Basically they all cursed and used profanity every chance they had.  This did not seem to fit with the characters and I must assume that it is a trait of the author.  Anyway, if you are interested in a book just brimming with feminist and women's issues as well as a new telling of the history of the world and can handle the roughness of a first novel, take a look at this book.	2004-04-27

Barron book THE MERLIN EFFECT.<br />Like Barron's last book that I reviewed this one has the feel of a very good juvenile.  Although while the hero is a ten-year-old girl, it is very easy to forget what her age is.  All that really matters is that she is with her father on a research trip.<br />This book tells the story of a new chapter in the myth of Merlin.  A sunken Spanish ship off of the California Peninsula coast may contain a treasure often called the Horn of Merlin.  Unfortunately the wreck is near a huge whirlpool, thus making direct investigation a chancy affair.  Time is at a premium as the local government is uninterested in extending the research visa.  Soon it is noted that there is something unusual about the area.  The local villagers claim to be hundreds of years old.  A pod of whales circling the whirlpool seem to be deliberately singing to jam the sonar equipment used to find the ship.  Unusual fish though to be extinct show no signs of aging.<br />A mishap at sea leads Kate, her father and the rest of the research team to the bottom of the sea where they encounter merfolk, monsters of the deep, the Glass House, Nimue, Merlin himself and an ancient treasure ship.<br />The story moves quickly and the plot twists frequently.  I found THE MERLIN EFFECT to be a very enjoyable read that, while on the light side, does not lack for substance.	2004-04-26

I had no problem with the overall plot but the writing was horrendous.<br />INVASION is the story of a microscopic invasion of Earth.  An ancient civilization seeded Earth life with a dormant DNA sequence.  Then every hundred million years or so a probe was sent to see how life had advanced.  The current probe has just landed and found life at a good stage for colonization.  Individuals are infected with a prion-like activator and flu-like symptoms ensue.  After the flu runs its course (about five hours) the person is changed and tries to infect others.  The infected people quickly gain control of large amounts of capitol and set up a foundation to preserve the planet's environment.  As key individuals are taken over money is made available, pollution spewing factories are shut down and the uninfected are targeted for infection.<br />That's the story and it could have been good if not for the writing.  I get the feeling that with a guaranteed bestseller that the effort for good writing just wasn't put in.  Robin Cook, master of the medical thriller, manages to make some medical blunders.  Blunders that as a doctor he should not make.  But it doesn't stop there.  He goes on to show a complete lack of understanding of the news services and how they are treated.  A story that the President and the other world leaders have all come down with a mysterious ailment all at the same time is reported by CNN in a 30s pulp style and no one pays attention to it.  Simple planetary motion also proves too much for the author.  Then in a real glaring bit of bad writing the head alien/infectee, who has access to all of the human's memories, is unfamiliar with the term dinosaur.  Even architecture is not safe from the author.  The mansion being used by the infectees has a ballroom based on a famous ballroom in France but is located both at ground leveland downstairs.  Infectees from around the world are collecting at the mansion which sits on five acres.  The descriptions of the hordes of arrivals should have people pressed shoulder to shoulder but the house and the grounds remain sparsely populated.  And it just goes on and on like this.<br />Readers will recognize the influence of other recent science fiction movies and books.  If you have seen the NBC mini-series and were hoping for a better version, you will be disappointed.	2004-04-26

Howe and Mark Stammers.<br />This book gives the histories of all of the Doctor's companions from the first episode through the novels written after the shows termination.  It does not include the new movie but it does mention some of the other post Doctor productions.  At the end is a listing of all of the actors and actresses and what they have done in addition to Doctor Who.<br />Each character and actor and actress is detailed.  See how extra players became companions (like Ian Marter and Nicholas Courtney), bit players became the Doctor (Colin Baker, but at least he was always a Gallifreyan) and how one companion died, co-created Upstairs-Downstairs and then returned as a villain (Jean Marsh).  You will also learn some of the oddities like how Jo Grant (Katy Manning) tried to escape her Doctor Who heritage by posing nude with a Dalek (or how she appeared in another production with Colin Baker).  I was just reminded of Jo Grant by a fiddler on Lord of the Dance who bears an amazing likeness.<br />Whatever your interest and whoever is your favorite, this book will tell you all you want to know, whether it is what the annoying Adric has been doing since wiping out the dinosaurs or just where did Mel come into the picture?	2004-04-26

Without thinking things through, she leaves her mobile home and boyfriend and takes to hitchhiking.  She soon realizes that she has no idea what she is doing and starts to hitch back.  That is when she gets picked up by the wrong driver.<br />Sharpe is a policeman who is looking for a serial killer.  This killer drains his victims of their blood and dumps them by the highway.  For some reason the bodies seem to get savaged by wolves.<br />Now Amanda finds herself captive of a short, fat, balding truck driver who claims to be a vampire.  He uses medical equipment to drink blood from her arm.<br />Amanda must think quickly to try and outwit the vampire.  Sharpe must get lucky to stop the body count from going up.<br />This is a wonderful story that starts fast and keeps going.  You find yourself rooting for Amanda and Sharpe and even for Amanda's downbeat boyfriend who was slapped by reality when Amanda disappeared.  I will not give away the ending but it did follow the ideas in the book and was quite satisfying.<br />If you like horror and/or vampires that don't fit previous stereotypes, this is one for you.	2004-04-26

Radio observatories around the world pick up the length-repeating signal and manage to piece the whole thing together.  As the code is broken the signal is revealed to be visual.  When put on a screen for the first time the scientists are treated to the image of Adolph Hitler.  The images are from the German Olympics which were the subject of the first strong television signal broadcast.<br />Underneath the picture data is more hidden data.  This is eventually deciphered to be the blueprints of a device.  As the world reacts to almost indisputable proof that we are not alone the device is built and a team is assembled to test it.<br />Upon activation the scientists find themselves traveling at unimaginable speeds to a distant location.  Each traveler is individually greeted in a form to make them comfortable.  One is greeted by a deceased father.  After glimpsing the almost miraculous peace of this civilization, the travelers return at the exact moment they departed and all of the records of the trip are blank.  Everyone refuses to believe that there actually was a trip except the travelers themselves.<br />While CONTACT starts out on a firm scientific basis that is gripping and well written, I found the novel as a whole to be disappointing.  What starts as good hard-core science fiction quickly transforms into the account of what can only be called a religious experience.  At least one bookstore actually shelved the book in the religion section.  While I personally have no problem accepting both science and religion I felt that this book did a poor job of joining or reconciling the two.  Despite my objections to the plotting I will recommend the book as it is quite well written.	2004-04-23

But when he gets there he finds a city in ruins with only a handful of survivors.  He sends some back in his ship before he finds out that the place is overrun by a malevolent alien life form.  Realizing that the survivors he sent to Earth were hosts for the Aliens Superman must find a way to survive and return to Earth before his diminishing powers are completely drained.<br />A very well written tale for either fans of Superman or Aliens.  The art is another matter.  Fro his first appearance, the long-haired Clark Kent resembles Penn Jillette of Penn and Teller more than he does any previous depiction of his character.  And if that wasn't enough, Lois Lane appears to be a sixteen-year-old with an attitude and a Veronica Lake haircut (for you younger readers that means her hair is pulled forward to cover half her face).  Then the evil scientist from Lexcorp looks just like a cousin of mine (and I don't think she would be flattered by the comparison).<br />So if you like Superman or Aliens then this is an entertaining story.  You just have to try and not pay too much attention to some of the character depictions.  If you can manage that I am sure you will enjoy the story.	2004-04-23

This is the tale of Niviene, daughter of the Lady of the Lake.<br />We see Niviene grow up from a young Fey still learning about her surroundings and follow her through becoming a mother and a companion to Merlin at the Court of King Arthur.  Arthur starts as just a tale Niviene hears from Merlin during his visits to Avalon.  Then there is their chance encounter and finally Niviene encounters him at Camelot.<br />But While this is an Arthurian tale there is very little about Arthur actually in it.  Instead we learn about the Fey, how they feel about this human king and the plots and reasons of Merlin.  We find out the truth behind Sir Lancelot and where he came from.  We learn about Mordred's shadowed history.  We even learn the truth behind the Holy Grail and why someone as wise as Merlin sent the knights of the Round Table looking for it.<br />All in all a very entertaining book that is both well-written and freshly plotted.  I recommend this one to anyone interested in Arthurian legend.	2004-04-23

An excavation unearths some strange clusters that turn out to be eggs that can still hatch if water is added.  An unscrupulous businessman sells the eggs through mail order ads in comic books.  <br />The eggs hatch into horrible ants that will eat just about anything (including you and me).  The ants are ancient in origin.  Although they are a natural species, they used to have natural predators that kept then under control.  The voracious ants whose natural predators are now extinct quickly spread to become a world-wide problem.<br />A wonderfully fun horror story.  I have enjoyed the entire Bug Files series.	2004-04-23

This bull is not quite like normal bulls.  It walks upright and speaks like a man.  It also comes from amongst the stars.  The story sort of becomes a twist on Twain's CONNECTICUT YANKEE.  Daedalus is commissioned to fashion a labyrinth, a welcome relief from the requests for terra cotta plumbing, and while helping the bull is given the knowledge he needs to fulfill his dream of flight (yes, wax has something to do with it).  The bull sets up a university in an inspired parody of university administration that just has to be read.<br />All of the classic elements of the tale of the Minotaur are present but with a twist of science fiction.  Like the original, this story involves tragedy as Daedalus just tries to be free.  Based on a short story that I haven't read, I found this to be one of Saberhagen's better novels.  If you can find a copy you should give it a look.	2004-04-23

What would happen if it turned out that the fantastic creatures of legend really existed but have been hiding until recently?  That is part of the premise of Brett Davis's book THE FAERY CONVENTION.<br />In America the magical beings came out of the closet and revealed their existence.  Now there is a movement to preserve their heritage by giving them a tract of land out West where they can be themselves instead of being out of place in human cities.  Humans and Faerie alike are on both sides of the issue.  Many Fairies look forward to being back to nature while others prefer the comfort of civilization.  Some humans fear them, some hate them and others love them as people or oddities.<br />But not all creatures have revealed themselves.  Bigfoot and the Sasquatch are still unknowns as are the great lake monsters.  One unrevealed group is out to destroy the peace.  A half-elf working for a senator finds himself in the middle of the plots and has to find a way to resolves the issues without leaving everything in complete disarray.<br />One of the things that made this book work for me was that the politics seemed real.  Too often politics in SF is reduced to two dimensions or a simple pastiche.  Not the case in THE FAERY CONVENTION.  All of the elements that make true politics so complex are present.<br />This is a well crafted and plotted book that I recommend to any reader that likes a sense of realism in their reading worlds.	2004-04-23

Koontz felt this book was too short to justify asking readers to pay hardcover prices so it was released directly as a paperback (since then a hardcover edition has been made available).<br />TICK TOCK is the story of a single night in the life of Tommy Phan, a Vietnamese American who has embraced American culture with a grip of steel.  Tommy finds a small rag doll on his stoop and brings it into his home.  Now what do we know about inviting evil into your home?  The doll quickly starts to change into some sort of reptilian creature that uses Tommy's computer to let him know he will be dead by dawn.<br />The rest of the book details Tommy's flight from his pursuer, his meeting a very strange young woman, his dealings with his family who thinks he is a disgrace and other strange occurrences.<br />Dean Koontz claims that he was attempting to recreate the feelings in some of the great screwball comedies.  Well, except for the very obvious dark elements, he came very close.  Except for his lack of the proper ethnic heritage I could very well see Cary Grant in the part of Tommy, Katherine Hepburn as his mother and Claudette Colbert as the love interest.  Of course suck a movie can not be made but it is fun to think about.  Tommy is the epitome of the screwball comedy male.  Trying to make sense of the craziness around him while everyone else thinks he is the strange one.<br />But even at almost four-hundred pages this is a very quick read.  The plot continues to advance while the tension builds and understanding begins to gel.  As tension rises so does the humor level.  Tommy's mother is hilarious while being believable.  The only real flaw I found was I did not quite fully accept the way the book was resolved at the end.  The ending fit but I just didn't feel it was done quite right.  But despite that I found it an enjoyable book that I heartily recommend.	2004-04-23

The novel is set on the Agamemnon, a generation spaceship made from a large asteroid.<br />A generation ship is a closed ecology and has little room for change.  But on the Agamemnon strange things are happening.  A botanist studying damaged herb plants encounters tiny humanoids with wings.  A young woman coming out of a broken relationship is seduced by an elf.  A security skimmer has a mid-air collision with a dragon.  Three teenagers experience a different virtual reality simulation than the rest of their class.  More people are going in for counseling and the suicide rate is on the rise.<br />All of these elements tie in with an intelligent program set up by a crazy genius during the first generation.  She had a plan in mind and it is up to some teenagers, the head of security, a biologist and a professor to determine just what the threat is and how to deal with it.<br />Hawke does a very good job of addressing possible problems on a generation starship and creates a very interesting solution to the growing problems.  This is a very entertaining read.  By page fifty I was hooked	2004-04-23

Set in some of the blank spaces of Tarzan's history, Tarzan runs into some very interesting characters.<br />In the first story, Tarzan is taken to the Paris opera where he runs afoul of a character known as the Phantom of the Opera.  With Tarzan's intervention this classic tale ends on a much more hopeful note.<br />In the second adventure, Tarzan is joined by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Nikola Tessla and Thomas Edison.  The characters are involved in an adventure involving a mad monk and an old book.  The book is the diary of Baron Frankenstein and the monk is his creation.  In the end Tarzan prevents any further dabbling in creating life and tells the creature of Pellucidar where he will be able to fit in.<br />The final story in the collection has Tarzan and a zoo gorilla track down the fiend that calls itself Mr. Hyde.  This is probably the best written of the three tales as it gives some very interesting insights into the characters of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.	2004-04-22

This may not even truly qualify as Elseworlds.  It is set in the not-too-distant future after the current heroes of the DC universe have had a chance to have children.<br />The premise involves what happens if the cornerstone of heroism is removed.  In this case that means Superman.  Superman upholds the law and all it represents.  After a particularly nasty episode with the Joker running loose, Superman apprehends him and brings him to trial.  A new hero, Magog, kills the Joker for all of his crimes.  The public speaks out and are in favor of this form of justice.  Superman then flies off and goes into seclusion.<br />Things go from bad to worse as supercriminals are put to death and the new heroes run rampant.  The heroes are now almost as big a danger as the criminals had been.  Something needs to be done.<br />Superman comes out of retirement and tries to beat the new heroes into shape.  Another faction led by Lex Luthor tries to stop him.  In the background the Spectre is trying to decide the fate of the world.  Will humanity or super-people be allowed to inherit the earth.  And what about the wildcard Captain Marvel?<br />Well plotted with a good ending this is an Elseworlds tale worth reading.	2004-04-22

For those who don't recognize the name, George Simpson was known as the greatest paleontologist of the twentieth century.<br />The story of Sam MacGruder begins in the future but after a time slip encompasses the end of the age of dinosaurs.  Sam finds himself in a primitive era with no hope of rescue.  Soon he learns how to survive in this early age and then sets about carving some stone tablet memoirs which he later sinks in a swamp.<br />This tale of time travel is framed by a series of weekly gatherings among some intellectuals.  As in H.G. Wells's classic, these characters are referred to by title and not by name.  This adds a delightful air to this short novel.  One of these men sets the stage of Sam's disappearance and of the discovery of the stone memoirs.  After the host tells these tales the others are invited to read transcripts of the tablets.<br />This volume also has an entertaining introduction by Arthur C. Clarke, a commentary by Stephen J. Gould and notes from Simpson's daughter who found the manuscript and saw to its publication.  All in all a very entertaining little book for anyone interested in time travel and/or prehistory.  The one thing many will hold against this book is the &quot;old school&quot; idea that dinosaurs were cold-blooded.	2004-04-22

This story is a chronicle of the last hurrah of the Golden Age mystery men.  Heroes who disappeared after World War Two.<br />The story centers around the lives of a number of mystery men and one who was sent to Germany.  All other heroes had been kept in the States by a Presidential Decree.  The President felt that if even one hero fell overseas then the morale of the county would plummet.<br />But one hero was sent undercover, the Americommando.  A minor figure in the golden age, he rockets to stardom upon his return.  His mission had been to kill all of the German super-beings and Adolph Hitler.  The Americommando, now in his mundane role as Tex Thompson, begins a project to create a new hero.  A hero not of mystery but of openness.  He succeeds and his political career really takes off.<br />But some off the old heroes manage to piece together the truth of Tex and his new hero.  A frightening truth.  In the story's climax, heroes come out of retirement to defeat the new menace.  We also catch a glimpse of the new heroes starting to come into their powers.<br />If you liked the old heroes of the Golden Age then this is definitely a story worth reading.  It is also a great tale for fans of hero stories or government conspiracies.  Take a look at it if you can find it.	2004-04-22

This time the book in question is THE RETURN OF COUNT ELECTRIC.  This volume is a collection of short stories.  During their original publication these stories prompted Roger Zelazny to declare Spencer the premier short story writer of the decade.<br />While Zelazny may have been right that Spencer's stories are very well crafted and written, his earlier books left me unprepared for this collection.  What really threw me about this collection was that I made it from cover to cover without encountering any elements of science fiction or fantasy.  I did, however, encounter madness.  As evidenced in his novels, Spencer has a knack for getting into the minds of the deranged and obsessed.  In one amusing story we are treated to the rantings of a man convinced that his wife is having an affair with Stephen King and feeding him plots.<br />So, while this book cannot technically be called science fiction or fantasy and resembles horror only in the most tenuous ways I was still a very appealing book.  Despite the lack of SF trappings, Spencer's writing still remains as captivating as in RESUME WITH MONSTERS or ZOD WALLOP.

Although the collection is titled after the final story, it is more about being alive than being dead.  Most of the stories deal with hard issues as well as the ghost.  The stories are as follows.<br />Drop By Drop - A 16-year-old has to put up with her family's move from city to country.  To make it worse, the ghost of a young girl is trying to tell her something.<BR>Dancing With Marjorie's Ghost - Beware of what you promise the dead.<BR>Shadow Brother - A young girl has to deal with her brother reluctantly going to war in Viet Nam.<BR>The Ghost - Students move into a house that was the scene of a murder.  The ghost has different ideas.<BR>For Love Of Him - A boy becomes fascinated with a tombstone for two lovers who died two days apart.  He seems to get sucked into their history.<BR>October Chill - A girl dying of cancer discovers she can see a ghost at the museum where she works.<BR>Being Dead - At the start of the Great Depression, a young paperboy gets killed when a jumper lands on him.  He can move on but decides to straighten out a few things first.<br />I was pleased by all of these stories.  The author shows a real sensitivity to the plights of the characters.  The collection is split in the middle by the almost humorous \\"The Ghost\\" which is far less serious than the three stories before or after it.  Check it out.	2004-04-21

Paying a lot for a single short story just doesn't seem right. But, when I can find one used for a decent price, I might check it out. <br />Young mystery writer Joyce Waltham has her second story published (the first was in Cardiac Arrest).  Joyce is a promising author and a local hero for her involvement in the previous tale.  This time she is shopping for copies of the magazine running her latest story when a policeman stops her to report a possible break-in at her car.  Joyce follows the policeman to the parking lot and the story really begins.  Joyce's detective mind is always at work.<br />This one is not quite as good as Cardiac Arrest as it lacks a similar level of surprise and twist.  This one is far more straightforward.  Still, it is an enjoyable little mystery.  But do check out Cardiac Arrest first.<br />I wouldn't recommend paying a lot for this one but it is worth reading.	2004-04-21

So what do you do when the public wants more of your character than you can safely create?  You invite other artists to put their own spin on things.  This volume is a collection of such stories.<br />Midnight Cowboy - A young Hellboy gets into trouble at Area 51.<BR>Haunted - Hellboy investigates a supposedly haunted house but finds no trace of ghosts but they find him.<BR>Family Story - Hellboy is doing research and discovers some strange goings on in the family that owns the library.<BR>Hot - Hellboy investigates something that is scaring people out of some Chinese hot springs.

Now he must face his ultimate challenges as he goes up against the office copier and the soda machine<BR>Abe Sapien Star of the BPRD - Hellboy is just a musclebound bulk while Abe Sapien is the one who really brings home the sushi (I mean bacon).<BR>Hey, Hey, Suckers! - Hellboy returns from a gala and can't help boasting and rubbing it in.<BR>Curse of the Haunted Doily - Kate faces her mom's ghost<BR>The Dread Within - Liz vs Possession<BR>Still Born - Hellboy attends a dangerous birth in reality and in his dreams.<BR>Party Pooper - Hellboy's birthday party<br />This is a fun collection.  The stories vary between the silly to the dark and eerie.  Art styles also cover most of the spectrum from the beautiful pencils of Hot to the cartoonish Hellboy and Co in Downtime.  A must read for any Hellboy fan.	2004-04-19

He carries with him a bottle with the hastily removed reproductive organs of his love Primavera.  He is also on Mars.<br />The nanotechnology plagues seem to be still around but the world is much different.  Ignatz is now a Dead Boy.  He has been schooled in the art of killing and eating girls.<br />Much of the plot, what little there is, can be confusing.  The book is split into seven chapters (the seventh very short).  While the chapters each start well, they degenerate into a stream-of-consciousness babble composed of pages-spanning sentences.  No real improvement over the first book.  I will read the third to complete the series but I have no great expectations.	2004-04-19

We begin just before his birth where his mother is dreaming of flying while in labor.  In her dream she plummets, awakes and Icaro is born.  But Icaro is not like other babies.  Icaro defies gravity.  Icaro also seems to be the result of some genetic tampering.  Icaro is then placed into study.<br />Twenty years later, Icaro is kept in a converted mining facility.  There he has grown up and never seen the sky.  Although twenty years have passed, the controlling characters seem not to have aged a single day.<br />But Icaro is not the only odd character.  The city is being attacked by rebels that can explode at will.  There is some hinting to their origins.<br />But the real story is that of Icaro as a young man.  Although he knows no other life, there is a growing need in him.  He seeks freedom, the sky, love and possibly lust.  His flying abilities allow him a great freedom of movement should he escape his cage (a large domes atrium).<br />This first volume ends with Icaro attempting freedom.  I look forward to the next volume of this intriguing story.	2004-04-19

For the past two years she has been a mercenary hunter.  Her prey has been vampires.  She and a rival have just been hired to infiltrate a vampire slavery den known as Midnight.<br />Turquoise was once a slave to a vampire.  It has scarred her physically and mentally.  Now she must put herself under a vampire's control in order to carry out her contract.<br />Once inside Midnight, Turquoise learns that not all vampires as a evil as those she has dealt with in the past.  They are still predators, but the come in varying degrees.<br />The ordeal Turquoise goes through reads like a rape or abuse survivor.  Unlike many in real life, Turquoise gets a chance to take revenge on her abuser.<br />This is a very strong tale that deals with some harsh issues (don't let the vampire trappings fool you).  This is a story of dealing with abuse and humiliation.  This was quite well done.	2004-04-12

Now the BPRD have their own stories.  This volume collects Hollow Earth and several shorter adventures.<br />Hollow Earth - Abe Sapien travels to the Himalayas and below to find and rescue Liz.  The journey takes them do a world of darkness that threatens the surface.  I really enjoyed the Journey to the Center of the Earth ending.  Also touching were there Hellboy flashbacks and how he endeared himself to various characters (I loved the lollipop).<br />Hollow Earth Teaser - A three-page teaser that sets up one of the new characters at the Bureau.<br />The Killer in my Skull - This story stars Lobster Johnson, a hero who uses the lobster claw of justice.  In this story he is confronted with some locked-door murders that lead to an unexpected killer.<br />Abe Sapien vs. Science - Having been the subject of scientific investigation in the past, Abe Sapien is against the use of &quot;scalpels and microscopes&quot; for advancing knowledge of living things.  This time the subject is Roger.<br />Drums of the Dead - Another Abe Sapien adventure as shipping routes are being terrorized by sharks and drums.	2004-04-09

What makes this one stand head and shoulders above the rest is that the artist set out to create one where all of the pieces were made from the same size piece of paper.  It is much easier to get a bunch of paper the same size than to cut and trim for multiple sizes.<br />The directions are clear and easy to understand as they take you through first folding the individual pieces and then assembling the final skeleton.<br />The entire project takes a bit of time but does not need to be done all at once and no step can be said to be really hard (there's just a lot of them).<br />All in all this is a very nice model and a well-designed book.  It should bring plenty of enjoyment to anyone who attempts it.	2004-04-09

Now that I have all three I am reading them.  I have to say I was a little disappointed by this first book.<br />The time is the future.  Europe had become the center of luxury goods before the economy collapsed.  One of the luxury items were the dolls.  Gynoids.  Artificial women.  But somewhere along the way something happened and a plague struck that could be transmitted between doll and human.  The plague created more dolls.  Now London is sealed off to try and contain the plague.<br />Primavera is mostly a doll.  Ignatz is in love with her and addicted to her.  They have escaped from London (no easy task) and are looking to put their lives together and cure her.<br />The story follows their quest, jumping between past and present in a manner where you are not always sure where you are.  These sudden scene changes added to the new vocabulary and the workings of the future world will make this confusing for many readers.<br />In the story we find out how they got together, how they escaped, what and who is behind the doll plague, and to what depths some might sink when all is falling apart.<br />It wasn't a bad book, but it wasn't polished either.  It reads like something that slipped into the wrong pile in the editor's office.  It really could use a little reformatting (not rewriting) to make the story better.<br />I hope the other two are better set up.	2004-04-09

The author has created some very intricate card buildings (see the Capital on the cover) but it all builds on some simple basics.<br />The author shows, with very clear instructions, how to start at the very beginning and then how to expand out, up, or both.  There is even a section detailing the fun of knocking them down.<br />The instructions are complemented by entertaining, and sometimes witty, text that holds the interest without becoming too scholarly.	2004-04-07

Paying a lot for a single short story just doesn't seem right. But, when I can find one used for a decent price, I might check it out. <br />Cora has just moved into a new apartment and had her new phone installed.  But on the very first day she receives a call.  The voice says he wants to be her friend.  Cora is understandably upset and calls her boyfriend for reassurance.  Everything will be fine, her boyfriend says, as long as the caller doesn't know her name or address.<br />The next call calls Cora by name.  He says he can see her.  Cora becomes frightened.  But in the end her fears are not what they should be as the story takes some very interesting twists.<br />Despite the shortness of this story, Laymon does an excellent job of building the suspense and then delivering the goods.  Few authors could have pulled this one off in so few words.<br />I wouldn't recommend paying a lot for this one but it is worth reading.	2004-04-05

Bob Mayer, a.k.a. Greg Donegan).  This on tells of Donnchadh and Gwalcmai and haw they started their revolt against the Airlia on their own home planet before carrying their fight to Earth.<br />Like its predecessor (Area 51: Nosferatu), this book jumps through the centuries and millennia showing just how these two characters have helped to shape human destiny for more than 14,000 years.  The book give science fiction answers to myths and legends all the way up to the resolution of the legend of King Arthur.<br />My one problem was with part of the recounting of Exodus.  The author makes many changes to the story but backs them up nicely in the framework of the story.  All except one.  The author claims that Egypt conquered the lands of the Hebrews and dragged them off in chains to make slaves of them.  Legend and the Bible say the Hebrews entered Egypt by choice.  Why does the author not give a reason to this change?  I don't know.  There is always a chance that it might get covered by another book, but I suspect it is just a mistake.<br />Other than the one unsupported change, the rect of the book was really quite fun to read.  If you enjoyed Area 51: Nosferatu then I am sure you will enjoy this one.	2004-04-05

They continued to evolve and become more intelligent (as well as smaller).  About 1 in 20 people is actually a dinosaur in disguise.  Vincent Rubio, a private investigator almost at the end of his rope is a velociraptor.<br />Just as everything is at its worst for Vincent, a large PI firm offers him a simple insurance case; check if a nightclub fire was natural or planned.  But Vincent doesn't like taking the easy way out.  So when some clues point towards similar ground to the case that caused him all of his trouble, Vincent has to plunge forward.<br />The case is an interesting one involving the death of a very rich dinosaur, the death of Vincent's partner, and more infidelities than you can wag a tale at.  This is all told in a classic hard-boiled detective tale.  Fans of Marlowe or Spillane will love the mystery.<br />Garcia does a very good job of creating a plausible world but does not hit the reader over the head with the details.  The details leak out in small amounts as they are necessary.  But these details are not held as a sudden revelation to solve the mystery.<br />I really enjoyed this one and look forward to the further, and previous, adventures of velociraptor PI Vincent Rubio.	2004-03-30

She is very gung-ho about writing more stories.  But then she gets a chance to see the dirty side of crime first hand.  She records the details in her mind for use in future stories but first she will have to survive the encounter.<br />I am most familiar with Laymon's horror writing where he excels at showing the dark side of people's personalities.  He uses the same ability in this little mystery as young Joyce must adapt to survive.<br />I wouldn't recommend paying a lot for this one but it is worth reading.	2004-03-26

The local doctor died recently leaving a practice and a town without a doctor.  This is a chance too good to pass up.<br />But things start going bad right from the start (literally).  Aside from the sickness and accident, there seems to be something disturbing the neighbors.  Then his daughter asks about ghosts and fireflies seem to be out early.<br />Eventually the doctor learns about a local legend of a primitive but sophisticated race called the Isolates.  They are isolated and seem to be the ones really in charge of the town and its inhabitants.<br />The doctor does not believe at first.  But slowly he learns what his part is to be in this town.  He does not like it and wants to get himself and his family out of town safely.<br />Nice and creepy.  It could have been a little better if the framing piece had been worked on a little better.  We are to believe that the book is on tape as the doctor recounts the events in the order they happened.  First of all, in the introduction there are some spoilers that would have been better had they been left out.  Secondly the closing part of the frame is more like Poe or Lovecraft; you know, the ones where people seem to keep writing even when they are filled with terror or dying?  But other than that, this was a very good horror novel and much better than his first (Atmosphere).  If you liked this one, you should check out Edward Lee's novel Creekers.	2004-03-26

Right from the start we know something is wrong.  The driver is strange.  He tries to keep the narrator off the bus.<br />As the story progresses you think you know where it is going but you would only be partially right.

Paying a lot for a single short story just doesn't seem right. But, when I can find one used for a decent price, I might check it out. This one is double the usual size from this publisher (60 pages instead of 26).<br />Linda goes to a Halloween party mainly to get back at the jerk she dumped.  The party host is known for being rather outrageous; last party had a real cadaver present.  This party has the partygoers splitting into teams on a scavenger hunt.  On Linda's team is the jerk and an unidentified ghost.<br />The plot takes us through a graveyard, a funeral home, and a spooky house.  All the way various twists are thrown out and we have to figure which one will develop into the horror.<br />Nice story with plenty of red herrings to keep you guessing although I doubt anyone will actually guess the ending (this is Laymon after all).<br />I wouldn't recommend paying a lot for this one but it is worth reading.	2004-03-26

Paying a lot for a single short story just doesn't seem right.

Janice accepts a dare to spend the night in a house where the previous owner met an untimely end.  She is determined to collect the $500 her friend Lyle has offered.  What happens during the night and what Lyle's involvement may or may not be takes the story headlong into a creepy ending.<br />It would have been nice having an extra paragraph or two to explain a little more about Lyle's past games but for the length of the story it works quite well.<br />I wouldn't recommend paying a lot for this one but it is worth reading.	2004-03-26

But recent hype has made me curious and I was pleased.<br />This first volume takes us to a Nazi plot to help win the war.  During a mystical rite, a small red creature appears and is dubbed Hellboy by the team trying to stop the Nazis.<br />Flash forward to present day where Hellboy has been working for the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense.  The man he has thought of as a father has been killed.  Hellboy assembles a team and goes after those responsible.<br />The story follows a wonderfully Lovecraftian story of ancient temples and races, strange creatures and magics, and information about what the Nazis were really trying to do.  We get some nice hints into Hellboy's true nature and more information regarding a certain Russian priest.<br />The story was enough to get me around the heavy-black art with its shade-free color swaths.  The only part of the story that bothered me was Hellboy's constant use of the phrase \\"the small part of my brain that was still working...\\".  It got to be a bit much in so short a tale.<br />The book also includes some short pieces of Hellboy's earliest appearances.  These make a nice addition to the book.	2004-03-26

Not For The Squeamish	The conclusion of the story begun in Gyo 1 plus two additional stories.  When last we read, main character Tadashi fell into a bin of fish (some dead and some walking).  This book starts with Tadashi seeing faces in the fog/mist/stench.  He then wakes up in a hospital a month later.  During that month things have progressed.<br />All of the fish now seem to be on land but they are not easy to find.  Tadashi finds his uncle and begins to learn some of the truth behind what is going on.<br />During the story we learn more about the walking legs, the fish, the gas, and the disease.  The revelations are not pretty but the story is very original.<br />Also included are two short stories.<br />In THE SAD TALE OF THE PRINCIPAL POST, we have a too-short story about a man who gets stuck under a house support.  This one just seemed pointless.<br />In THE ENIGMA OF THE AMIGARA FAULT we encounter a new fault in the Japanese countryside that has just opened.  It reveals tunnels shaped like silhouettes.  As the new begins, people flock to see the strange tunnels.  Some believe that there are tunnels shaped like themselves.  Those who encounter these seem to be drawn into a hypnotic trance and enter the tunnels.  Some dream segments give us a glimpse of the final horror of these strange tunnels.<br />A good volume that will probably give many people shivers if not actual nightmares.  I am not surprised that the fast moving plot concluded the story in only two volumes but I was disappointed to know there wouldn't be more.	2004-03-22

These risen are better than new and go back to their old lives.  The phenomenon is also quite local, occurring in the small town of Anderson.<br />One night an abused wife kills her husband and the deputy is accidentally shot.  The woman's husband returns to life and forgives her.  The town is aghast.  The deputy returns to life but only his accidental killers knew he was dead.  Why is he keeping it secret?<br />We follow a reporter, the woman he is most interested in, and her young son as they all become involved in the strange events going on in the town.  They come to suspect that there may be more risen in town than those they know.<br />The risen return to life, many in secret, and all become devoted to Seth.  Seth is the one who led them back to life.  Seth has a plan.  Seth is in charge and is not questioned as Seth's motives are his own.<br />This is a very interesting tale.  I enjoyed it quite a lot but would have like just a little more information.  Maybe a little more about who or what Seth is.  Maybe an explanation on why some of the deaths are handled they way they are or why some are left for later.  These details could have made a good book into a great book.<br />If you like creepy horror books where the action keeps escalating and keeps you guessing, then you will probably really enjoy this one.  But if you want one that is gorier, you should try The Rising by Brian Keene.	2004-03-22

Paying a lot for a single short story just doesn't seem right.  But, when I can find one used for a decent price, I might check it out.<br />The Lonely One is the story of Doreen.  She is at the Santa Monica pier and she is lonely.  On the carousel she meets a young man and tries to convince him to go away.  She says that if he goes away he will live longer.<br />Well, such a statement merely increases curiosity and the young man refuses to be put off by the lonely beauty.  The rest of the story involves a little cat and mouse as she tries to avoid him and he refuses to be left.  Finally we learn the truth of her loneliness and her warning.<br />A nice little tale.  It is a very quick read, only a few pages in regular size, but crafted so that the story moves and reaches an acceptable resolution.<br />I wouldn't recommend paying a lot for this one but it is worth reading.	2004-03-17

Some legends believe that the Earth passed this way once before and life sprang up on the planet.  But this time there is already life on the planet.  The result is a supercharge of life to the point that the dead start to walk.<br />The walking dead take the form of skeletons surrounded by a hazy body.  They are not mindless zombies.  They retain the full knowledge of their past life.  But put a skeleton near a normal living person and they go into a killing rage.  Regular humans are becoming scarce.  Even the skeletons who want to preserve normal humans have a hard time restraining themselves.<br />Abraham Lincoln is back in the White House.  He is leading the country in a new time of trouble with a new type of civil war.  But the President also listens to his advisors.  He knows that reanimation may be temporary and that regular humans need to survive to carry on once the skeletons stop.<br />This is a wonderful new take on the walking dead theme.  This is not a gore-fest.  It is an intelligent working of a creation myth.  Yes, there is a lot of death, but death is not the thrust or point of the story.  Very well done and the ending is also rather unique.  Check this one out.	2004-03-17

But they are not just reanimated corpses.  No, they are inhabited by ancient being that were consigned to the Void eons ago.<br />We follow three main characters as they try to survive in this new world.  The first is Jim, a divorced father who is convinced his son is alive and needs to be rescued.  Next we have Dr. Baker who worked at a government facility that may be responsible for the influx of creatures from the Void.  Finally we have Frankie, a street-smart, heroin-addicted prostitute.  She is tough and the new world order has forced her to kick her habit.<br />These three characters fight for survival in a dangerous world.  Not only dead humans are walking.  Rats, birds, dogs, and other animals are also revived and their controlling spirits are intelligent and can work together.<br />Eventually the three meet as their paths cross and Jim continues his quest to find his son.<br />A very fast-paced tale.  The new type of zombies are quite interesting.  The perils are very deadly.  But I felt the ending was very weak.  It was almost like there should have been another thirty pages or so.  It was unfortunate.  I really expected more from the ending.  Well, maybe there will be a sequel.	2004-03-17

But that won't stop Satan and the forces of Hell from trying to get her in their control.<br />Two things may save Cassie.  One is an angel working on her side.  The other is the creation of an Etherean, the male version of what Cassie is.<br />Satan has some very large plans and he needs Cassie or the Etherean to pull them off.  Cassie and her angel have other ideas.<br />This is the second book involving Cassie and the Mephistopolis (the city of Hell).  This time around Cassie gets to see more of the hellish city (as do we).  A very nice follow-up to City Infernal.  I liked this book a little better than the first.<br />Be warned, much of the book takes place in Hell so things are not nice.  Yes, many bad things happen to the characters and walk-ons in the book.  This is Hell after all.  For me, however, this version of Hell just doesn't work.  Considering how quickly must lose their bodies, or parts thereof, it is astounding how many people have been walking around in perfect shape for centuries and millennia.  Destruction falls indiscriminately on the residents.<br />Still, this is a good story where the author is not afraid to pull out all the stops when trying to show how hellish Hell can be.	2004-03-15

Our two main characters, a woman trying to leave her checkered past behind, and an eighteen-year-old natural transsexual just released from juvie hall, are just starting to enjoy their new freedom and beginnings when one of them is attacked at a gas station.  Improper assumptions are made, accidents happen and the two are being blamed for a lot of bad trouble.<br />But in their escape they manage to run afoul of some organized crime.  Now they have the police as well as the mob after them.<br />Plenty of action of all types; guns, explosions, fast cars, and plenty of sex.  This is the first volume and really only just gets the story going but the reader really wants to see how they get out of this mess.	2004-03-12

Future revelations are pointed at early in the book with numerous comments.  But even though there are plenty of signs pointing the way, it is still a fun journey.<br />The Charmed Ones are contacted early one morning by a witch fearing for her daughter.  The woman does not trust other witches, or Whitelighters, but is worried that her daughter's witch powers have not manifested when the should have.<br />The sisters try to solve the mystery of the missing powers while also trying to balance the delicate 48-hour grace period when a witch aligns with good or evil.<br />Add the friends daughter, a trouble maker, and a demon with a grudge against generations of the family and you fast action with plenty of confusion so that, while you know where things are going, you're going to enjoy getting there.<br />In the end the mysteries are solved and loose ends are tied up as is typical in a Charmed novel.  This one is better than many of the more recent Charmed books.	2004-03-10

Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos.  Many authors have done a wonderful job adding to this mythos.  This story is not one of them.  In fact, the most entertaining thing about the book was the introduction.<br />Alan Moore does a fine job showing us that he is familiar with many details of the Mythos.  He does this the same way he showed his familiarity with Victorian literature in The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen.<br />But unlike in League we do not have a story to hang the references on.  We are introduced to an investigator who specializes in seeing the patterns in chaos.  He is very good at his job.  He is currently undercover looking into a series of unconnected murders.<br />My real problem is that the story has only one character.  He starts off as a genius seeing connections no one else can.  But then, when the obvious is in front of him, he sees no onnections whatsoever.<br />The story is very nicely illustrated in a clean black and whit by Jacen Burrows but clean art cannot save a story that is not there.  Very disappointing.	2004-03-09

He is playing the game with friends.  The game is safe.  It is not the real thing.  But before he knows it, Barney is sucked into a real game once again.<br />This time he has a parasite living in his brain that can control his actions to a degree.  The parasite and at least one of the aliens wants Barney to travel to a planet of man-eating crabs.  To make matters worse, Barney also has to watch out for another player; a girl he really likes.<br />Barney must combat his parasite, escape from giant crabs, avoid being killed by other players, and somehow make his way home.  But will the Piggy let him?<br />A very nice sequel that times up some loose ends from the first book.  However, I would have liked some explanation as to how the Americans and Chinese got to the planet of giant crabs.  That detail just stuck in my mind the rest of the book.  But still, it was a quick-paces and enjoyable book.  Certainly anyone who enjoyed the first one would enjoy this one as well.	2004-03-09

He and his family are vacationing in a cottage for the summer.  But there are two strange things about the house.  First, it is supposed to be haunted by the son of a previous owner.  A son who was insane and locked up for twenty years.  In Barney's room, no less.  The other is that the neighbors in the cottage next door seem inordinately interested in it.<br />Although the neighbors seem to be young and very successful, they seem to take a shine to the young Barney.  They are also obsessed with playing a science fiction game called Interstellar Pig.  They get Barney involved in the game as well.<br />The game set is very sophisticated.  The play is simple as the players try to find an object, the Piggy, and be the one holding it when the game's timer runs out.  At that point the characters not holding the Piggy, and their home planets, are wiped out.<br />But Barney notices the neighbors strange behavior.  Evasive answers and strange speech patterns drive Barney's curiosity.  What is it about the game and the neighbors?  Who are they really?  Why are they so interested in the ghost story?  Finding the answers will make this Barney's most interesting summer.<br />I might have given the book four stars, but there were some serious flaws in some of the scenes and information in the book.  For that reason I only gave it three stars.  Most readers are not as particular to these types of flaws and will not be bothered by them.  Otherwise, this is a very fun book.  Look for the sequel; PARASITE PIG.	2004-03-05

That was not on of Mr. Bradbury's better collections.  But The Toynbee Convector is full of all the tales and ideas we know Mr. Bradbury is capable of.<br />We begin with the title story involving time travel.  Next we get a dark tale of mysterious trapdoor.  From there we meet ghosts, banshees and things that are not there.  We return to Green Town, see romances, experience jealousies. and meet writers.<br />The stories cover a very broad spectrum of Mr. Bradbury's work.  Because of that, some who read the collection straight through (as I did) might feel bounced around a little by the changing themes.  Others, like myself, will savor each story for what it is, from literary popcorn to written gem.<br />If you like the author's older collections, then this is one for you.  If you thought One More For The Road was his best, there will still be something in her for you.	2004-03-02

There is very little action here.  We do get a health dose of plot and character development however.<br />In the previous book, Gaia underwent gene therapy to cure her fearlessness and thus, hopefully, add some normalcy to her life.  Here is what everyone is up to.<br />Gaia - Feeling fear and being confused by it.<br />Jake - Confused by the new Gaia, but they did have \\"the conversation.\\"<br />Oliver - Concerned for Gaia.  Maybe.<br />Ed - Still recovering in the hospital.<br />Liz Rodke - Still championing Gaia.  This time with a society event.<br />FOH - Reluctantly decide Gaia must have something going for her as she keeps landing the great guys.<br />Shadowy operatives - Still in the background keeping an eye on Gaia.<br />This one ends with a bigger cliffhanger than most which wants us to read the next one.  It promises to have more bang than this one.	2004-03-02

Charles &quot;Chigger&quot; and his family are trying to decide where to go from the Moon.  They will take the HARLIE unit with them.  Everyone still wants the unit to help survive the polycrisis Earth is having.<br />But the moment the family makes up their mind, the roller coaster of events takes off again.  HARLIE and its abilities represent survival and power for many groups and colonies.  Their bids for possession and control drive the Dingillians on.<br />Once on their way things are still not perfect.  Charles may have found true love but religion has reared up and started questioning HARLIE's nature.<br />Religion, good, evil, and being human are some of the big issues dealt with in this volume.  Again Gerrold does a masterful job of blending large doses of philosophy into the action in ways that don't slow down the plot.<br />The book's end leaves room for further adventures of HARLIE and the Dingillian family.  Let's hope we see some of them.	2004-02-25

There they go though a series of grueling survival missions just to stay ahead of everyone who wants to stop them.<br />The big complication is that now they know they are carrying the latest generation of a HARLIE unit (an artificial intelligence introduced in Gerrold's When HARLIE Was One).  As things get worse on Earth, control of the HARLIE unit represents power and possibly life over death for many groups, governments and factions.<br />Before it is all over, everyone winds up in court to see who should really have custody of the HARLIE unit.  There are some surprising arguments and results.<br />Another fine book that has me aching for the final book in the series.  Lots of action and introspection.  Once again everything is from Charles's (Chigger's) viewpoint.  How can they stay alive?  Who can they trust?  Where should they all go?<br />If you have read the first book (Jumping Off The Planet) you will really want to read this one.  If you haven't read the first one, you really should before reading this one as much will be totally confusing otherwise.	2004-02-23

In other words, a butterfly flapping its wings in China could cause a hurricane on the other side of the world.  But this book really deals with the Bradbury Effect as in his A Sound of Thunder where the death of a butterfly in the distant path has unknowable effects on the present.<br />In this book we have a character with a very messed-up life.  Not only is his family dysfunctional (dad is in the nut house), but he has blackouts and does very disturbing things.<br />The book takes a long time to get started by filling in tons of background history.  Eventually we get to the point where our character learns he can effect things in the past.  Usually to disastrous effects.  He keeps trying to correct things but they keep getting worse.<br />So, will he be able to make things better?  Unfortunately two things stand in his way.  One is that &quot;time travel&quot; is bad for his brain.  The other is that people think he is crazy and want to lock him up.<br />So we wind up with a series of bad lives that we stop caring about after a while.  We also learn a bit about his talent (although not enough).  Finally we get a cute, romantic-comedy-style ending.<br />But my big question is if he had total blackouts, how was he able to write about the events in his journals?  We don't know how much of the events he managed to transcribe, but at least with the video camera incident we do see that he wrote about things he didn't remember and then didn't remember he wrote about them.  Too weak for me.<br />This is a long book for a novelization of a movie aimed at this audience and it just doesn't work or interest.  I am sure it could work for readers who don't care about the details (sort of like viewers who made Armageddon successful).  As a movie novelization, the author obviously did some work to fill out the story.  I can only suspect that the movie has to rush through many of the events in the book.<br />I give it three stars for the author's efforts to fill out the story (it's not his fault the story didn't work in the first place).	2004-02-19

He suggests a trip to the Moon and, against all previous behavior patterns, actually seems to follow through on the idea.<br />Getting to the Moon involves using a space elevator located in Ecuador at Sheffield Clarke.  This is one of two currently in operation.<br />But nothing is quite so simple.  Mom thinks Dad is trying to kidnap the children.  Where did Dad get the money?  What about all of the strange characters who are interested in the family?  Needless to say, it gets quite complex.<br />The whole story is seen through the eyes of the middle son (Charles or Chigger).  Because of this, events and characters often seem more incidental than they really are.<br />The story is also fleshed out with loads of discussions on planetary economics, physics, biology, etc.  There are also complications from the overcrowded Earth.  Plagues are starting to spread over vast sections of the planet and there have been reports of giant pink caterpillars that can eat horses (Chtorr?).<br />Kids may star in this book, but it is really aimed at the thinking reader.  This is not a fluff piece or an action yarn.  But it is very entertaining and a good first piece to the series.	2004-02-19

The stories are as follows:<br />The Mantis Woman - Title character collects heads and turns them into dolls for her own secret purpose.<br />Zenda's Family Hell - A strange family moves into the neighborhood and begins exacting their own form of justice on the locals.<br />Koala is watching - A twist on the evil teddy bear story has a haunted stuffed koala terrorizing young girls.<br />The water beckons - Fear of not knowing how to swim can unleash other horrors at a haunted pool.<br />Hell's gumball machine - The title device grants wishes, but not in expected ways.<br />Snake boy - A wealthy family owes its fortune to the title character, but fear paying the cost.<br />Very good stories.

It's a crazy world.<br />This book shows many funny and intriguing warning labels as well as some of the stories behind them (why can't we remove the mattress tag?).<br />Wry wit and cynicism attach these labels we take for granted (and seldom read).  But I could not help think that some of the observations missed the mark a little.  For instance a hair dryer has a label saying not to use it in the shower or while sleeping but fails to mention the bathtub (does that mean it is ok to use it in the tub?).<br />But still, this is a fun book to read alone or with friends.  The book even comes with a section of fake warning labels that you can apply anywhere.	2004-02-13

She shows what we can learn from the animal kingdom, both do's and don't's.  She then usually makes a very entertaining quip on how to use this knowledge.<br />Many readers will be surprised by the supposedly natural behavior of these animals that includes adultery, philandering, prostitution (I kid you not), rape, orgies, masturbation, sex toys, stamina, death and just about anything else you can think of.<br />For those who may find these behaviors hard to swallow, there is an appendix that references sources for all of the facts portrayed.<br />Very fun and laugh inducing.  Read it unless you are too shy (just remember bookstores keep it in the humor section).	2004-02-05

This time around astronomers detect an anomaly that turns out to be much smaller and closer than originally thought.  The object appears to be an intelligent black hole.<br />The first half of the book details the discovery and revelations of the new object and what it could mean.  This is told through the small group of scientists heading the investigation.  Two are married to each other, one is the Royal Astronomer from England and the other has more bureaucratic tendencies.  But they balance our into an effective team.<br />The second half of the book deals more with how to deal with this entity and how to survive its curiosity.  The second half deals more heavily with politics than the first half but does not lose the science pace.<br />Throughout the book we find ourselves following the life of the lead scientist who is dying of breast cancer.  As she is coming to grips with her upcoming demise she is also at the heart of one the greatest moments in scientific history.  We really get into her character.<br />The Eater in an ancient entity and it has certainly been around the block, but that does not make it wise.  Its system is subject to destruction through many means and mankind manages to utilize one to deter it, not destroy it.  There is a definite feeling at the end that it, or another like it, could return at any time.<br />This book sprang from Mr. Benford's attempts to play with some new ideas about magnetic fields, their nature, and their capabilities.  I think he did a great job and the book is quite worth reading.	2004-02-04

This is probably the best Superman title and one of the best overall.<br />A few hours difference in the arrival of superman's space capsule could mean landing half a world away from Kansas and that is the premise.  Superman has landed in the Soviet Union and has been raised by loyal Socialists.  Superman's presence in the Soviet Union drastically alters the future.<br />Superman rises to power despite the conflict of political ideals and the Warsaw Pact signs on new members.  We see the world change and see the lives of many familiar figures form the DC universe; Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, etc.<br />This is more than just a remake of the Nazi Superman (Ubermensch) as seen on Saturday Night Live.  The story is fairly believable and Superman is as true to his upbringing as in the regular DC universe.  The story progresses nicely until we see the final surprise plot twist.<br />A wonderful story for Superman and Elseworlds fans.	2004-02-04

The Charmed Ones go up against some luck demons and fid themselves transported back in time to LA.  This is supposed to be bad luck but is actually good.<br />The sisters and a powerless Cole are stuck in the past.  To help find a way back, they become involved in film making and organized crime.  Paige manages to double for an actress who looks just like her and is apparently an ancestor of her adopted parents (this is never developed).<br />Eventually the Charmed Ones must take on some more luck demons and try and save the future as they know it.<br />The resolution is a little odd and make no sense (how Cole defeats the demons' abilities, that is).  But, as this is not the TV show, we know they must all survive and return to the present.<br />When I finished reading this one, I just had to think, what's the point?  I had thought the discovery of an ancestor that looked like one of the Charmed Ones and how it could be would play a major part but it was just left unexplained.  Oh, well, I am sure many fans will like it.	2004-01-30

But shortly after she finds herself as the only one in the group without a boyfriend.<br />A wish is made and Lucy may have found the absolute perfect boy.  Or is he?<br />In the end the four friends prove their friendship and support of one another.<br />Pretty good pacing and better than Lucy's first narration.  Lots of references to Bridget Jones.

The first is how to tell Molly about his magic as he has no other secrets from her.  The second is to deal with the fact that all of his old beliefs are coming true.<br />Add one character from the previous book who thinks Tim has done him wrong and the plot is set.  No real tension, even when an important character has his soul stolen.<br />If you like the previous books, you will like this one, but if you prefer the comics than this one is closer than the rest.	2004-01-26

This is another 24-hour story (like Deception Point and Angels &amp; Demons) and follows a similar formula.  It is fun to read and a real page turner, but there are so many flaws that a reader may have their enjoyment derailed.<br />Lets look at a few of the flaws.<br />First, apparently in the minds of intelligent people, the NSA is just or rumor or they have never heard of it at all.  Not very realistic.<br />If you have a super computer and you continually deny its very existence, you should probably not put it under a big glass dome in a major city (the one in the book is under such a dome; clear enough to see the stars at night).<br />If a program is available for download on the Internet and you change it, it does not change the copies that people have already downloaded.<br />There is a secure database separate from the Internet at the beginning of the book, but later it is described as fully connected and under siege from hackers just waiting to get into a system none of them knows exists.<br />Put a bunch of very intelligent people together who can handle just about every problem, but at the end of the book start calling up wild goose theories and stats instead of the standard and obvious (which should have been their first choice).<br />Have a bunch of people whose job is breaking codes and have them disbelieve that there is a code in front of them.<br />There are also plenty of &quot;historical&quot; facts that need to be taken with a grain of salt as they reflect popular opinion of history and not what actually happened.<br />Most of these problems will become evident and contextual if you read, or have read, the book.<br />Still, as I said earlier, it is a fun and fast book.  However, if you have read other Dan Brown books you will probably be able to figure out a lot as it followsthe same formula.	2004-01-23

She thinks she is running from death when she runs into the protagonist (an unnamed author).  She then disappears into the night.<br />The author becomes worried and, with the help of a strange cast of characters, tries to track down Constance and the names that might still be alive.  The quest leads into the history of Constance and Hollywood and literally delves into Hollywood's grim underbelly.<br />This is a strange tale but full of interesting scenes and tales.  It is also fun to figure out who the protagonist is.  There are plenty of oblique clues.<br />A little different from most of Bradbury's writing, but still with his unmistakable style.  A good read for any Bradbury fan.	2004-01-20

The first is a fun little story about Buffy's sister Dawn.  Buffy is the target of a magician but Dawn is accidentally given the &quot;evil&quot; device.  A fun addition to the &quot;evil Teddy bear&quot; genre.<br />The main story picks up right after the events of Viva Las Buffy.  Buffy has returned home to discover that her sister has read her diary.  The results are that Buffy winds up in an institution for the disturbed.  There she is treated until even she begins to doubt that she is the Slayer.<br />There are a couple of interesting tie-ins to the television series (obviously the one where it turns out she never left the institution) including the mythos portrayed in the Initiative episodes.<br />A must read for fans of the show and books.  Well done and nicely fills a gap in the history.	2004-01-20

Books	4	17	17	N	N	Sets Pattern For Ghostworld and Hellworld	This is a sequel to Blue Moon Rising, but like Ghostworld and Hellworld, the character base has been trimmed from the epic to the contained.<br />The time is ten years after the Demon War (see Blue Moon Rising).  A border fort was constructed to secure a border with Hillsdown.  But now the fort has gone silent.  A team of Rangers is sent to investigate.<br />Upon arrival at the fort it is obvious that there is something very wrong.  Soon the Rangers must join with some bandits in order to survive a horror that threatens the whole world.<br />Dream sequences give a great personality profile for each character in a similar fashion to the flashbacks in Blue Moon Rising.  While a direct sequel to the events of Blue Moon Rising, this is a tough and gritty tale that does not have the Rupert/Dragon/Julia/Unicorn brand of humor.  But it is no less a good yarn.<br />If you like the Forest Kingdom books (or the Twilight of the Empire books), you should take quite well to this one.	2004-01-15

In this volume (#31), Gaia has to deal with her father being away again.  That means she will stay in a boarding house specially set up for agents' children.<br />It is during this confusion that Gaia, through a series of new characters, may have found a way to become normal.  Add the usual relationship dramas, a nasty new street drug and more complications that most books of this size could hold and you get a fast-paced rush of a story.<br />Here is what everyone is up to:<br />Gaia - Trying to become normal.<br />Ed - Still trying to get over his Gaiabetes and define his new girlfriend.<br />Tom - Away on assignment.<br />Oliver - Concerned about Gaia and becoming more forceful.<br />Jake - Still hooked on Gaia and loving it.<br />The Queen of Toothpaste, et al - The new rich kids and family.  They attend Gaia's school but seem to have sought her out.<br />Shadowy Agents - More spies and agents running around making observations, leaving the reader to guess desperately as to who they are working for.<br />Note:  This volume mentions Gaia's brother (from Gaia Abducted) thus tying in some of the events of Super Edition #2 (although much of it still contradicts the main series).	2004-01-12

Not just any Prince Charming, but every Prince Charming you have ever read about rolled into one.  He leads a busy life rescuing princesses and slaying dragons.  He is heir to the throne and a favorite of all in the kingdom.<br />But why is he not happy?  Could it be that when rescuing a naked princess he only gets a handshake as gratitude?  Could he really want more than just the knowledge of a job well done?<br />Well, everything changes when one of his missions uncovers the secret of his father's past infidelity.  Seems Prince Charming has an older sibling.  That means he is no longer first in line for the throne and that changes everything.<br />Most every fairy tale you grew up with is parodied or lampooned in this book.  This book manages to fuel laughter without crossing the line into plain silliness.  It is a wonder that with such a marvelous book out that we have not heard a lot more from John Moore.	2004-01-09

It has spawned a number of sequels (Down Among The Dead Men, Beyond the Blue Moon, etc.) as well as the Hawk and Fisher novels.<br />Prince Rupert is the second son of the King of the Forest Kingdom.  As such he could be trouble for the succession and be used as a pawn in a civil war.  Thus he has been sent by his father the King to go out and slay a dragon.  That should be the end of the second Prince.<br />But Rupert is more dedicated to his duty than any would believe.  He survives the Darkwood, finds a dragon, rescues it from a Princess, survives the Darkwood again and returns home.  All in the first few pages.<br />But all is not well when he returns.  Not only did he not conveniently die, but the Darkwood is now growing, a Blue Moon will rise soon and the Demon Prince may have returned.  It is up to Rupert to find the High Warlock and convince him to return from exile and help the kingdom.<br />All the while he has to put up with assassinations, plots, an overbearing brother, an arranged marriage, the Champion, demons beyond counting, a wise-cracking unicorn and the possible end of the world.  Well Rupert is not going to take it all lying down.  He will do his duty even if it means not dying.<br />Fun and light but with a serious backbone of a plot.  Rupert's early encounters with the unicorn, dragon and Princess help set the tone while the setting of the Darkwood and its demons set the pace of the plot.  A wonderful book.  Fans of this one might also want to check out Slay And Rescue by John Moore.	2004-01-09

In general, I am often disappointed in the Arcadia Press books.  They are often little more than a bad picture book.  But this is possibly one of the best in the Chicago series.<br />Hyde Park is a community that has just celebrated 150 years (in 2003).  For more than 100 of those years it has been part of Chicago.<br />Hyde Park is the home of the University of Chicago, the Museum of Science and Industry and the site of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition (recent building in the area uncovered the footings for the original Ferris Wheel).  As such, the community has had a long and rich history.<br />I do not know who Leslie Hudson is (no biography in the book), but she obviously did her homework and research.  The post card images have been captioned with detailed information.  The book itself is divided into thematic sections with the cards sorted into a historical order.<br />I was a little disappointed in the sparseness of the Sans Souci material (on of Chicago's first amusement parks) as there are many wonderful post cards from there.  There were also some other nuggets I was sorry to see missing (i.e. a hotel that suffered after it was recommended by the ...), but overall I was very pleased by the content and the thoroughness of much of the research.<br />A fine book for fans of Chicago history as well as fans of Hyde Park.	2004-01-07

One day, for some unknown reason, he decides he would like a New York bagel.  He send a pigeon with a message to New York to order one bagel to go.  When the bagel does not show up right away, Yum Yung decides that he must search for it.<br />Yum Yung encounters a farmer, a fisherman, a beekeeper, and a baker while searching, but to no avail until suddenly everything comes together and the whole cast gets the chance to enjoy a fresh-baked bagel.<br />A truly fun story told in just the right way for young readers (repetitive language, etc.).  After reading the book, go back to the start and you will notice that while Yum Tung is dreaming of his bagel, all the settings of the story are visible from his hilltop.<br />The only downside in the book is in the opening illustration that seems to place Korea in the vicinity of France or Spain (East and a little south of New York).  Considering the obvious care in the rest of the illustrations I found this rather unusual.  But this should not detract from this story of a young boy who has a dream and sets out to make it a reality.	2003-12-29

The play is, of course, based on earlier stories and legends and possible history.  The theater is actually an old church reputed to be haunted.<br />Things begin to heat up quickly.  A professor discovers an old book that may prove Hamlet was plagiarized word for word.  Then during a rehearsal, the troupe is sucked through the stage and into the real-life story of Amlodd (Hamlet).  They find themselves in the roles they have been studying except for the professor who seems to have swapped bodies with Amlodd.<br />Not wanting to die like their play-characters, the actors try to disrupt the story but discover that the story has a lot of momentum.  To make matters worse, one of their number seems to be channeling some form of deity.<br />I have to say that I now know more about the history of Hamlet than when I started to read, but it was not a history lesson.  In fact, some of the later revelations would have been right at home in one of the finer novels of Richard Laymon.  Some may find these revelations a little disturbing.<br />I would have to say that this is sort of a fantasy tale and sort of a horror story but that it leans more towards the fantasy.  A very original book.	2003-12-29

During the course of the book we learn the truth behind the weather, earthquakes and forest fires.  We learn much of this during a series of flashbacks from our main character who starts the book by going on the lam.<br />Humanity, it turns out, would be dead if it were not for the efforts of the Wardens who lessen the severity of storms, quakes and fires.  They are often augmented by pairing up with a Djinn.  But Djinn are not the only magical beings around and there lies much of the heart of the story.<br />Throughout the course of the book we get a very full picture of the life of Joanne Baldwin, Weather Warden.  From her earliest days of being aware of the weather through her present crisis.  It is all very nicely blended between high-speed chase and fascinating history.<br />I highly recommend this to anyone who loves a good yarn, secret histories, against-all-odds thrillers, urban fantasies or similar tales.	2003-12-29

I have truly enjoyed his novels.  This is his first collection of short fiction.  I had to read it right away, but I wound up being disappointed.<br />Short horror fiction is often far mor intense than horror novels, but that is not the case with this collection.  At best the stories are odd.  Usually they are just dull.  I found myself reading the stories in hopes of finding the gem in the collection.  There was none.  This was very odd as I could relate to many of the characters.<br />All in all I have to say that fans of his novels may want to pass this collection by as the stories within bear little resemblance to his longer works.	2003-12-29

While spooky and unpredictable, I felt there was something missing from the characters.  The story centers around a group of students who play with a Ouija board at a party.  They were way too easily convinced that the Ouija board truly worked.<br />The entity communicating through the board convinces the group that there is &quot;loot&quot; hidden in a mine on a secluded mountain.  The group decides to go for it and steals the board from their professor (the one hosting the party).  Once the professor realizes what has happened, she sets out in pursuit as she has had bad dealings with the board.<br />What follows is a fun and fast-moving tale and one of a series that has me convinced that Richard Laymon does not like the woods.  Many surprises and tense moments wrap the character development until the story resolves in unexpected ways.<br />Definitely a good book for Laymon fans although it is not his strongest.  But, as with many Laymon books, we do see just how thin a line there is between civilized and horrible.	2003-12-29

Gone is the European feel of so many of her books.  It is replaced by a healthy jargon-filled dose of American Western.  Gone are the hedgehogs; welcome the armadillos.<br />Bo is one of four armadillo brothers.  He tends to be curious and wander so his mother tries to keep a close watch on him.  Like all armadillos, Bo's eyesight is not very good.  So one day while he is following a lizard, he sees a red cowboy boot and thinks it is a red armadillo.<br />The boot in question is being worn by a young girl who is trying to scuff them up so she won't look like a tenderfoot at the rodeo.  But Bo does not see the girl, or the other boot for that matter.  Instead, he thinks he has found a playful new friend.<br />Chasing after the boot, Bo has many experiences while his mother and brothers search for him (as seen in the side panels).  Bo's adventure takes him across the rodeo arena, to a bar-b-que, into an encounter with a jalapeno, to a barn dance, a hayloft, and ultimately to the truth about his new friend.<br />In the end we learn that while Bo has learned the truth of his day's adventures, he knows just what to do when he feels a little mischievous.<br />I usually give Jan Brett's books five stars but gave this one only four.  I did that only because of the heavy use of Western jargon that needs to be explained to young ears in order for the story to make sense.  But it is still a very fun book with beautiful illustrations.	2003-12-17

The three little mice have heard the story of Chanukkah and about the shining lights.  They decide to search the house for the lights.<br />As they set out each night they find many of the things associated with the holiday (i.e. menorah, dreidel, latkes, donuts, chocolate coins, presents, etc.).  But they do not find the lights until the eighth night when their mother shows them where it is.<br />The story is told in a rhyming sing-song much like many Dr. Seuss books.  There are also flap that reveal what the mice discover each night.  My daughter started out by reading this to her dolls and then had me read it to her several times in a row.<br />While this book does not delve into the history of the holiday, it does a very nice job of dealing with many of the holiday symbols that children will run into.	2003-12-16

Earth is under the control of a group mind known as One True and Mars is slowly being terraformed by geoprospectors who are searching for and releasing water, CO2, methane, etc.<br />Our story centers around a young girl just as she becomes an adult.  She and her father are geoprospectors and are very good at it.  The story is told as memories she relates to a police shrink.  This gives the reader plenty of foreshadowing for some of the later events but really leaves the ending as a surprise (although the hints are there, you don't realize it until after the fact).<br />The story moves quickly and you can really care about the characters.  While most of the science is believable (no faster-than-light travel for example), much of the setting relies heavily upon synthesis and replication that may never be possible at those power levels (but it doesn't really detract from the book).<br />A fine book of hard science fiction with excellent character development.  If you like that sort of thing, this one won't disappoint.	2003-12-16

There are a few more influences from the Fearless TV show as we see Gaia beginning to work with a team (al la Buffy and the Scooby Gang).  This time it is Gaia, her father Tom, uncle Oliver, and Jake who must band together and save the day from the man Natasha was working for.  A little information given here is contradictory to that given in Gaia Abducted (thus placing the Super Edition outside the true storyline).<br />Gaia - Coming to terms with having a family and possibly a new boyfriend.<br />Jake - Still interested in Gaia and spy work although at times he is not sure he is ready for real spy work.<br />Tom - Must confront trouble from his past as well as reconcile with his brother.<br />Oliver - Trying desperately to atone for his past as Loki.<br />Natasha - Still in custody and maybe willing to talk.<br />Sam - Still in love with Gaia and thinks they still have a future.<br />Ed - Wondering at the incurability of Gaiabetes.<br />Loki - Probably gone but we don't know for sure.<br />Dimitri - We finally learn some of his secrets.<br />All this in only a little over 200 pages.  A fast-paced and packed book that develops the series nicely.

In Annie, as in The Mitten and others, Jan Brett tells a fun children's tale while gently showing how a children's actions affect the world around them.  Just as the boy in The Mitten winds up scaring all of the animals that then crawl into the mitten, Annie's actions also have wide repercussions.<br />Annie has a cat.  One day she notices the cat does not want to play, but tries to hide in odd places.  Annie keeps finding the cat so the cat tries the outdoors.  This makes Annie lonely as she wants to have a pet around the house.  <br />She bakes corn muffins to leave outside in the snow to attract a new pet.  But Annie gets more than she bargained for as first a giant moose and then a bobcat shows up.  Annie makes more muffins and more animals show up.<br />But eventually the corn meal runs out at the same time as the warm Spring winds begin to blow.  Without any muffins, the animals leave and the cat is free to come back.  By following the illustrations in the borders, we know what the cat has been up to and what prevented its return.<br />The only downside of this book (at least in my daughter's eyes) is that there is no mention whatsoever of a parent.  Are we to believe that Annie is living at the edge of the woods all by herself?  But still, it is a beautiful book and a fun story.  A must read for fans of Jan Brett's other books.	2003-12-14

Small areas and small casts combined with high tension and sometimes the possibility of greater impact.  Such is the case with this one.<br />An out of work programmer begins to suspect that his wife is having an affair.  But at the same time other strange things begin to happen at home.  As the questions about his wife's behavior begin to become to much, he is offered a job straightening out a programming problem at his wife's firm.<br />The problem concerns nonotecnology and using microscopic robots for imaging.  Some of the nanobots are loose and not responding to controls.  Their fail-safes seem to be inoperative.  The devices are evolving and they are dangerous.<br />The story encompasses about a week with most of the action happening in a single day.  Like Jurassic Park, the story is told from an after-the-fact perspective so some of the tension can't quite build.  There are a few unanswered questions that seem like the answers were edited from the final draft (i.e. the black cloaks) but it still reads well.<br />All in all, if you enjoyed Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Strain, Twister, or other similar Crichton stories, you will be hooked on this book.	2003-12-08

Involvement with the SWAT team gets them involved in protecting the Kings.  The Kings of Haven and Outremer are prepared to sign a peace treaty but there are many who would profit greatly from war.  This makes the Kings excellent targets.<br />But one of the plots against the Kings may be too much for even Hawk and Fisher to handle.  The story runs right to the final page keeping the reader in suspense.<br />Another good story with plenty of action as well as thinking.

The two guard captains have not been in Haven long, but they have made a reputation for being tough and honest.  They have faced many terrible things (the worst being in their first adventure, BLUE MOON RISING), but now they face possible dishonor.<br />A terrible new drug is about to hit the street and Hawk and Fisher are there when a sample is taken.  The results are so horrible that Hawk leads a raid on the drug runner to stop him before the new drug gets to the population and destroys the city.  But all of the evidence disappears and the perp is released.  Hawk and Fisher are now targets from above.<br />But instead of being taken off duty, they are split up.  Hawk has to find out what happened to the evidence while Fisher is volunteered for a suicide mission guarding some peace talks.<br />But things go wrong and soon both Hawk and Fisher are disgraced and on the run.  Somehow they need to clear their own names and find out what happened to their partner.  Not an easy task when everyone in the city wants the reward for turning in their corpses.<br />Another fine mystery/suspense tale.  This one ends with an uncharacteristic happy scene.  We see a little more of what has make Hawk and Fisher wh they are as well as some more hints to their pre-Haven history (see Blue Moon Rising).	2003-12-03

This one begins to show more of Hawk and Fisher's pre-Haven history.<br />The story opens with Hawk and Fisher trailing a spy.  But the spy gets away and holes up in a tower belonging to the Quality (the Aristocracy).  The two guard captains must go undercover and pose as distant relatives in order to locate the spy.

Buffy is long gone and so is the vampire menace.  But as the years have gone by, the demons are slowly managing to get back into our world.<br />Fray is thief, plain and simple.  But she does have a good heart and tries to take care of others.  But years ago her antics resulted in the death of her twin brother.  Little does she know she is about to be tapped for something greater.<br />First a man tells her she is the chosen one (then he sets himself on fire).  Next, a huge demon tells her the same thing.  But Fray has not been experiencing the signs the demon tells her about; there are no dreams.  The demon must convince her of her heritage and train her before another power can open a gateway that will let all of demonkind ravage the Earth once more.<br />This is a very-well crafted tale and shows the Joss Whedon's genius.  One can only hope that there will be more tales of Fray in some form or another.  If you like Buffy, you will love Fray.	2003-12-02

The squad is not used to murder investigations but they are also not used to working with the Guard.<br />While the rest of the squad work to keep hell from breaking loose (literally), Hawk and Fisher follow the meager clues to its startling, but inevitable, conclusion.<br />Another good tale with plenty of action as well much to make one think.  The mystery is well done as is the additions to Haven's history and make-up.  Not just simply Swords &amp; Sorcery (although there is plenty of that).	2003-12-02

One desperate reporter is dragged into the story and reports what he is told.<br />The killer has struck far more than the dozen times currently believed.  Far more.  But these recent killings are a warning and that is why he signed them with the name Morningstar.<br />Something is going to happen soon and the killer does not know what.  All he knows is that he has been hunting vampires (the real ones and not those of legend) for many years and something wants to stop him.<br />The reporter is enlisted to report on the events after they happen so that the world will know that vampires are real and need to be dealt with.<br />But is the killer right?  Are there really vampires?  If so, were his victims really vampires?  Does any of it really matter?<br />A very nicely told tale.  Certainly not what I was expecting from the blurb on the back.  I was expecting cheap escapism and found an intelligently written story that examined reality and our perceptions.  Far better than the packaging would lead one to believe.	2003-12-02

But the animated treat is too fast and slick.  Always eluding capture and befuddling its pursuers.  But as the whole town gradually joins in the chase, young Matti, who did the baking and opened the oven too soon, stays quietly at home and consults the cook book for a solution.  So, as the townspeople think they have chased the gingerbread baby to its doom, young Matti knows differently.<br />Another beautiful book from a talented children's author.

Hawk and Fisher are married, members of the Guard, honest, and very good fighters.  Unfortunately their honesty tends to get them assigned to undesirable positions.<br />As an election looms, Hawk and Fisher are assigned as bodyguards to a Reform candidate in a district that could cause a change in power on the council.  Together they have face vampires, werewolves, and many other evils, but are they ready for the political arena?<br />Their charge has made a lot of enemies and although sorcery is forbidden in elections, the opposition won't let that stop them.  As the election nears, Hawk and Fisher must face deceit, treachery, sorcery, mercenaries, kidnaping, love and dirty tricks galore.  To make matters worse, something is stirring on the Street of the Gods.<br />A nicely woven story that shows how politics can be costly even for good causes.  We learn a little more about Hawk and Fisher's past as they are relatively new to the city of Haven.  While not quite a mystery like the first book in the series, this is still a wonderful tale and it follows the first quite well.	2003-11-25

Thus there are many wonderful folds that have never been diagramed.  That is why it is so wonderful when a great designer manages to take the time to produce a book.<br />But this book is no ordinary collection of designs.  Instead, Lang tries to guide the reader through the creative process and various techniques for designing new origami figures.  From simple concepts to pattern grafting, circle packing and other techniques, the folder learns about powerful design tools in a clear and efficient manner.<br />Some origami books have brief explanations about design but only a few have gone into any real depth (J.C. Nolan's Creating Origami comes to mind), but this is the clearest and most detailed account written to date.<br />Of course the book is also packed with instructions for reproducing some of Lang's amazing creations (including the famous Black Forest Cuckoo Clock).<br />I hope that this book remains in print for many years as it is an amazing resource for folders and designers.	2003-11-24

They must make the most of the new world and give the all-clear for colonists to survive.  The sooner they do so, the sooner they will received much-needed supplies.<br />But this world is a puzzle.  All signs say it should be full of life but it appears barren.  Then a small deserted city is detected and the squad heads for it.  It is then that the nightmare begins.<br />The events of Ghostworld are in the past and the Empire once again encounters life that could be detrimental to its survival.  But in order for the Empire to know, the squad is going to have to survive long enough to get the word out.

The unique metal trees are needed by the Empire but a native revolt forced the Captain into scorching the planet.<br />But now the mining base has lost contact with the Empire and thrown up a shield.  Joined by an esper, an Investigator, and two marines, Captain Silence must solve the mystery.<br />But the mystery proves far more dangerous that any thought possible as the cast encounters a frightening threat to the entire Empire.<br />A fine addition to Green's Empire novels.  The action is fast and furious and the resolution is satisfying.  Much different in tone from Mistworld, the first book in the series.	2003-11-20

Mistworld is a rebel world and has been fending off the Empire for several hundred years.  But now things are starting to get out of control.<br />Mistworld is a harsh world and the Empire's blockade has reduced most of the society to almost medieval levels.  But there is high-tech and psionics.  We meet thieves, con men, agents, investigators, council members and businessmen; a huge cast of characters for a 218-page book.<br />A lot of people die in this book but the death is not graphic.  It is not a happy tale but it is well written and you will remember it.  It is also quite different from the others in the series in tone and style.<br />This is a must-read for anyone familiar with Green's Empire novels but it also stands alone very well.	2003-11-19

The city is Haven and it exists in a world of magic.  But this is not some simple sword and sorcery story.  No, Hawk and Fisher are intelligent characters as well as excellent fighters.<br />The team has ticked of some higher-ups when they investigate a report of child prostitution.  As a reward for this action, they have been assigned to hunt down a vampire that has been eluding capture.<br />No sooner have they completed that assignment, then they are assigned as bodyguards to a city councilor who has made many enemies with his progressive reforms.<br />They begin the task at a dinner party held at the home of the sorcerer Gaunt.  But soon a murder occurs.  A locked-door mystery ensues and Hawk and Fisher must find the murderer.  But soon another body turns up and the investigation must proceed more quickly.<br />Although set in a fantasy world complete with magic and monsters, this book is a wonderful mystery.  The pace does not let up and the reader is kept guessing as to what will happen next.  A very enjoyable read.	2003-11-18

This book is no exception.<br />The book follows the a young man who fell in love with a witch depicted in a painting at a local art museum when he was a young boy.  Having a decent job in computers and no romantic interests to spend his money on, he frivolously buys a lock of hair reported to be from the witch in the painting.  Then the strangeness begins.<br />First he is approached by another art collector in a local pub.  Then, in need of a bathroom, he exits his train at an unfamiliar stop and sees Honest John's House of Clones.  But surely cloning isn't possible, or even legal.<br />Well, armed with his genetic sample, the young man sets in motion events of cosmic proportions.  Lies and coverups follow fast and furiously.  He, and the reader, are stuck trying to figure out just what the real story is.  Was he genetically designed just to clone the witch?  Is he the son of God?  Who are all of these people who look alike?  What is with the bags of sugar?  And are the frogs really in charge?  These and many more questions are eventually answered amidst a fast-paced story liberally seasoned with intelligent witticisms.<br />If you are a Tom Holt fan, you will want to read this one.  If you are new to Tom Holt, this is an excellent book.	2003-11-18

But then Cole manages to finally arrive and the fireworks begin.<br />But as Cole realizes his mistakes, Phoebe is tricked into the Underworld.  Now Cole, only human, must journey into the Underworld to rescue his love.<br />An interesting story and one of the better Charmed books.  I might have given it a slightly higher rating, but I felt the ending was weak.  After all, the method to get Cole and Phoebe out of the Underworld would have worked just as well on just Phoebe, thus keeping Cole safe.  This would quickly restore the Power of Three and enable them to handle any repercussions to her rescue.	2003-11-18

The Nightside is home and/or workplace to some very odd, powerful and scary beings.  In this book, we jump right into the weirdness of The Nightside as John is concluding a case with a very disturbing and dangerous entity.<br />John hears that the Grail may be nearby and is soon hired to find it.  But this is the Unholy Grail, the cup used by Judas at the Last Supper.<br />The Unholy Grail is sought by many powerful and dangerous beings.  Among them are the Angels (from on High and the Fallen) and they are nasty.  Unfortunately for John, using his talent for finding things can alert others as to his whereabouts.  Thus John must use all of his natural skills, experience, and reputation to stay alive, find the Grail, and keep it out of the wrong hands (which are just about everyone's).<br />En excellent sequel that reveals a little more about John Taylor and the history of The Nightside.  It is obvious that if this one sells well enough the author will have more tales for us.	2003-11-06

The only one who sees them leave is the hero of the story, a child in a fireman's hat.  The babies crawl and the child chases.  Eventually the babies are rounded up and returned to the parents and the hero gets a much deserved rest.<br />While the tale is simple, the illustrations add a wonderful dimension to the story.  The pictures are done in a silhouette style but with no lack of detail.  We see the babies crawl, hide in trees, and other antics.  My favorite is the baby with a bow who starts hanging upside down like the bats.  In the final scene we see this baby and a parent both hanging from the rafters.<br />A delightful book with detailed illustrations and fun rhymes.  Kids learn that even little kids can be heroes.  Check out all of Peggy Rathman's books.	2003-11-03

In the Get Fuzzy world, cats and dogs can talk and humans have no problem with it.  Bucky and Satchel are Rob's two pets and the three of them make a hilarious household.  The almost continuous story arc makes this read more like a novel than a collection of individual strips.<br />In this volume you will see such things as:<BR>The International Conference of Dogs<BR>The Cat Conference to take over the world<br />Bucky take on the ferret next door<BR>Bucky loose his fang<BR>Bucky sue the ferret on Judge Judy<br />If you liked the other Get Fuzzy collections, you will love this one.

Each of the stories is quite different.<br />First we have a spy thriller staring Pumpkinhead Jack.  Is her really a hero or is he just pulling our leg?  The answers might be surprising.  The most entertaining story of the lot.<br />Next we have a tale of a young boy in the Library Corps.  He must take his red wagon and retrieve book that were taken out the previous night.  The weakest of the stories and far too cartoonish for my taste.<br />Next we have a three part story of a powerful witch who is the target of a group of death gods.  She is joined by a Fetch (a type of ghost).  Nice plotting and shows promise of further tales.<br />Finally we get a short collection of loosely-joined scenes meant to answer dream questions we were afraid to ask.  This has its ups and down but is generally OK.<br />A reasonable collection that will hopefully be followed by more in a similar vein.  We shall see.	2003-10-29

Much time has gone by and Morgan has a 15-year-old daughter named Moira.<br />The book opens with a prologue not too long after Full Circle.  Morgan has returned to Ireland and is helping to rebuild Belwicket.  Hunter is traveling all over setting up the New Charter, the successor of the Council.  But tragedy strikes and the book shoots forward 15+ years.<br />The story is told in alternating fashion between Morgan's and Moira's viewpoints.  Moira is looking forward to her initiation and a boy seems to be interested in her.  Her mother is immediately suspicious.  Between that and spellcraft homework, Moira comes to learn far more of her mother's past.  As she tries to deal with the knowledge and how it might affect herself, Moira gets caught up in events as danger returns from the past.<br />An excellent story that starts grim but is compelling right to the wonderful ending.

But one man has felt they were silent colonial invaders.  He wrote a book about it and has been labeled crazy.  His nephew, Hoichi, thinks he could still be right, but has had to bear the brunt of bullies (and is now an excellent fighter).<br />But on the tenth anniversary of the alien arrival, the aliens make their move.  They almost immediately destroy the UN forces and take control of the globe.  Hoichi has been selected by his uncle to be a hero.  He is to be the pilot for a super, giant robot.<br />An excellent story that unfolds nicely.  Hoichi is a good hero character and at first really gets into his role.  But the power he wields can cause collateral damage and he begins to have doubts.<br />One of the more intelligent Mecca stories out there.  Good characters and character development joined the intricate plot and background makes for a very enjoyable story.	2003-10-29

Being an aviation buff, and contributor to aviation books, I was quite surprised at this book.<br />Typical of Arcadia Press, the book is a collection of illustrations with captions but no actual text.<br />Many of the illustrations appear to be third or fourth generation copies as they are of poor quality.  This book will either lose a lot of money for the authors because of the fortune that would need to be spent for publishing rights to these photos, or the rights were not secured.  No photo credits are given (or postcards or advertisements).<br />I recognize many of the images.  They are owned by the Chicago Historical Society, United Airlines, The Wright Brother's Estate, The Smithsonian, etc.<br />If you are just looking for pictures, you might like this book (despite the poor quality of many of the pictures).  But if you want an actual history, you will be very disappointed.  A better book would be Chicago Aviation: An Illustrated History by David Young or Chicago's Midway Airport: The First Seventy-Five Years by Christopher Lynch.	2003-10-28

When things at home get too tense with her stepmother-to-be, Alisa runs away to visit her newly discovered family.<br />Things become weird almost from the start.  Her uncle is friendly, her grandmother seems surly, and Alisa seems to be falling for her cousin's boyfriend.  To top it of, a family ghost seems to be becoming far more active and dangerous.<br />Alisa must show courage and strength in order to deal with her new family, her old family, her new powers, and the secrets behind the ghost.<br />A wonderful story which stands apart from the Morgan/Hunter main storyline, but one that ultimately leaves the reader wanting an extra chapter.  As the story reaches its conclusion, we don't find out how things really turn out.  We suspect how they do, but the book and the series conclude without any more information.  Maybe there will be another Super Edition that will finish things up (or maybe a spin-off series?)<br />Anyway, a fine book about courage, strength and self-discovery.	2003-10-27

This one alternates between Morgan's and Hunter's viewpoints.<br />Morgan is having nightmares and everyone thinks she might be the target of a spirit; possibly Cal's.  Hunter is called to discreetly investigate a coven leader who might be being tempted by dark magic.<br />Hunter has resigned from the Council but is still interested in many of its ideals.  Now he must juggle those, a sense of right and wrong, and still help Morgan with whatever is plaguing her.<br />While Morgan is trying to solve her immediate problem, she is awarded a scholarship to a school of magic healing.  But in order to go, she will have to have the support of her Catholic family.<br />In the end, the book is nicely resolved and the series is tied up although there is plenty of room for more stories (i.e. what happens in Scotland?, what about Killian?, what about Alisa?, etc.).  Very nicely done.	2003-10-27

For those who don't remember, Alisa is the girl who is scared by Morgan because strange telekinetic things happen when they are together and she feels Morgan is unable to control her power.<br />One day, at practical magic, Morgan picks up a Book Of Shadows from the seventies.  This is actually on we have seen excerpts from in a previous book.  But when Alisa is visiting Mary K. (Morgans younger sister), she steals the book.<br />The book winds up revealing things about Alisa's family and just who Alisa is.  As Alisa begins to deal with her situation, she gets caught up with Morgan, Hunter and Hunter's father as a new and serious danger threatens them and much of Widow's Vale.<br />The story switches back and forth from Morgan's point of view to Alisa's.  There are no excerpts starting each chapter, but there are some interesting quotes.  A good book that seems to really move the series towards a conclusion.<br />On a side note, does anyone else thing the town should change its  name to Widowers Vale?  Morgan, Alisa and Hunter are all missing mothers.  Plenty of widowers and no widows.	2003-10-23

There are a brief prologue and epilogue that has Morgan and Hunter, but the rest of the book is told from the viewpoint of Rose MacEwan, an ancestor of Morgan's who lived during the Burning Times (the Spanish Inquisition).<br />Hunter is back and he has brought back a book chronicling the life of Rose MacEwan, a woman who first created the Black Wave.  Hunter and Morgan read it.<br />Rose is a young woman (Morgan's age) who falls in love with a member of another witch tribe.  Her mother is the High Priestess of their coven but does not seem to trust Rose.  Love, witchcraft, passion, trust and betrayal all lead to shaping Rose's life.<br />As Rose has to deal with her personal trials, the anti-Wodebayne sentiments are on the rise.<br />Rose's story culminates with her creating the Black Wave spell (although it seemed pretty simple for a spell so powerful).  As the story closes, Morgan wonders at the parallels between her life and Rose's and what it might mean for her future.<br />A nice piece of history, but a little out of synch with the rest of the series and its linear progression.  I also missed the journal entries that previously started each chapter (they are absent in this volume).  I would have liked to have seen something from Rose's mother's viewpoint or even Diarmuid's.	2003-10-22

In this book, he travels North to find them.<br />This is the first book of Sweep that is not from Morgan's viewpoint.  Instead, we get small snatches of her in the chapter openings.<br />All is not well for Hunter.  He tracks his parents to a poor backwater.  It is here that he learns the truth of his parents' flight their abandonment of him and his siblings, the fate of his hometown, and what his father is really up to now.<br />But as Hunter tries to confront all the new revelations, the Council sends him to investigate a young witch who is collecting the true names of things and people, and writing them down.  He even discovers a possible link in Morgan's past.  How can Hunter handle it all?  You will have to read it to find out.<br />But if family and job were not enough, Hunter also discovers a secret about his life and position that he never suspected.  I guess that will be the subject of a future book.<br />Although this book differs from the rest by being from a different viewpoint, it works very well in the series and should not be a disappointment to fans of the Morgan-oriented stories.	2003-10-21

She also begins to have strange dreams as someone or something seems to be trying to contact her.<br />Kit is sent to check on a new young wizard who seems to be stuck in his Ordeal.  The boy turns out to be autistic and a major target for the Lone Power.  Kit is again joined by Ponch who is turning into quite a marvel.<br />Kit and Nita's paths come together and their friendship reflourishes as they help Daryl and challenge the Lone Power once again.<br />Some very good character development and realistic situations.  I actually enjoyed this one more than the previous book.  I am now looking forward to the next one.	2003-10-17

They check the paper and find a notice about a lost dog that sounds like the one they found.  Sadly, the girls go with their mother to return the dog.<br />The dog belongs to a gruff orchard owner and the girls are heartbroken to leave it.  But the next morning, the dog is back.  The girls must go through the pain of returning the dog yet again.<br />But this time when they return the dog, the farmer doesn't want it back.  He has gotten himself a new and bigger dog.  If the little dog wants to keep running to them, then they can keep it.<br />Even though it was hard to do, the three girls did the right thing and wound up being rewarded for their good deeds.<br />Each pair of pages has the story on one side and an illustration painted by the author on the other.  Be sure to read the other Flicka Ricka Dicka books (and check out Snipp Snapp and Snurr while you are at it).	2003-10-15

Like all of his other books, the directions are in clear black and white (with some grey shading) and are easy to follow.<br />The models in this book range from simple to complex.  One unusual aspect of this book is that many of the models were designed by other folders such as Sy Chen, Gay Merrill Gross, Stephen Hecht, Robert J. Lang, Won Park, Mike Thomas, Peter Farina and others.<br />Models include Boat, Three Diamonds, George Washington Slept Here, George Washington Framed, Star of David, Windmill, House With Chimney, Sword, \\"One Way\\" Arrow, Tetrahedron, Cube, Diamond, Tulip, Evergreen, Tree, Flower, African Mask, Shirt With Tie, Swan, Crane, Vulture, Goose, Flamingo, Peacock, Pelican, Eagle, Asian Dragon, Alligator, Tyrannosaurus, Rabbit, Armadillo, Squirrel, Aardvark, Llama, Bison, Butterfly, and Dragonfly.<br />The book even includes methods for creating paper in the dimensions of a dollar bill in case you want to do different sizes or just reduce the cost of your \\"paper\\".<br />A fine addition to any origami library with a little something for everyone.	2003-10-15

In this case we have a young man and woman as well as a scientist/inventor.<br />The story begins as the young man and woman are on a trip and she notices a terrible smell.  The smell seems to move and finally the source is found; a fish on legs.  The crab-like legs seem to keep moving even after the fish is dead.<br />Soon the real horror begins as more wish on legs appear.  Each brings a horrible stink with them.  Fish big and small pour onto land and wreak havoc.<br />But even that is not all.  We discover what the source of the fish legs might be and what might be lurking within the stink.<br />The book progresses very rapidly leaving me to believe that this must be a short work, say a trilogy like the author's Uzumaki trilogy, and not a longer piece like Parsyte.  It seems like a very good opening to the story, but I will have to see where the author takes it to see if the series itself works well.	2003-10-14

There is even a second creature modeled after the first, but without the faulty brain.<br />Alten takes these stories and glues them together using liberal amounts of technical jargon, model numbers and tech specs.  The resulting sum is less than the parts.<br />Before the story can even get started (or hook the reader) we are assaulted by long passages of technical details meant to give realism but seem, instead, to just show the author did some research.  If I was not familiar with the author's other books, I would have put it down right at the start.<br />The story takes place in the near future.  Although the book is recent enough to mention the World Trade Center attacks and destruction, Alten misread the political climate.  There is no mentions of the War on Terrorism and in 2009 Sadam Hussein is still firmly in power.  There was also some seeming trouble with time and travel.  For example, even as fast as the Goliath is, it still takes a while to get from the Straights of Gibralter to the Indian Ocean when going around Africa.<br />All in all I was not very pleased with the book and found myself racing to the finish just so that I could review it.  I did like the little tribute to The Outer Limits/Watchmen at the end but it was too little too late and missed the mark on how the Military would probably have really reacted.	2003-10-10

One photo for each calendar week.<br />While there are origami patterns included with the calendar, they are not for the models pictured.  They are for simple traditional models and are appropriate for the beginner.  As a way of learning origami, this is not a good choice.  But as an attractive desk calendar this is a beautiful and well designed item.	2003-10-08

While there is some additional information given about the Superman and Batman timelines from the first volume, most of the book actually concerns the lives of other DC heroes.<br />Once again we see classic heroes in a universe where they age and breed at normal rates.  This could have been very good, but there was just not enough space.  Too many heroes are introduced with little or no explanation.  Some are better fleshed out than others and some secrets of the universe are revealed.<br />Generations was a wonderful book, but Generations II makes the reader feel that Byrne will have to fill in all of the years to make it work for the DC pantheon.  But then that would eliminate the Generations idea.  The adventures are entertaining, but we want to know more.  Perhaps it would have been better to do a Flash Generations, Green Lantern Generations, Wonder Woman Generations, etc.	2003-10-08

One set in a different sort of comic universe.  One where the characters age at a normal rate.  Central to the story are two classic heroes, Superman and the Batman.<br />Skipping ahead through time in ten-year increments (with a final chapter taking place earlier than the rest), we follow the careers of Superman and Batman as well as their personal lives; spouses and children.  There are some classic villains thrown into the mix but this is really the story of lives and not individual adventures.<br />Byrne does a very good job of capturing the look and feel of the comics' eras the stories are set in.  He even includes the original inconsistencies in the universe (i.e. Superman originally could not fly (leaping in single bounds) but Superboy could).  Unfortunately, information like this that was included in the original introductions were cut from this collected edition thus causing some confusion.<br />Some of the book is very dark as with aging comes dying.  There are arguments, strife, separations and mysteries.  Who did Bruce Wayne marry?  We don't know as her face is never shown.  But the effect of these generational glimpses is one of a complete story that is entertaining all the way.	2003-10-08

The lure of the water is strong but after two mishaps, one very minor but the other potentially serious, the boys are taught to swim so that they will be safe around the water.  They even enter a swimming race after their father returns.<br />One thing I really liked about this story is that it did not try to have the boys learn to swim in a single lessor or day.  Instead it talks about all the various lessons (treading water, back float, dog paddle, etc.).  This is good for children who might otherwise get discouraged if they don't seem to learn as quickly as storybook characters.<br />Each pair of pages has the story on one side and a painted illustration by the author on the other.  Check out the other Snipp, Snapp, Snurr books (and the Flicka, Ricka, Dicka books).	2003-10-08

The clueless parents have no idea what is really going on and they make are pretty much left out of this volume.<br />Instead, we get more interaction between Courtney and her uncle, a powerful sorcerer.  This volume has more of a continuous plot than the first and gives us a better idea of the magic community.<br />Courtney may be tough and headstrong, but even she knows to be careful when something very nasty has been summoned in the woods.  Will her uncle be able to stand against it?<br />Then Courtney is privileged to visit the night world of the cats and meets a new friend.  A friend that others believe has harmed a popular sorceress.  Courtney and her uncle work to save him.<br />As Courtney works to save her friend, she learns more of the Council and the politics that seem to drive it.  Courtney is not pleased.<br />These four tales are a little darker than those of the first volume, but Courtney shows good character development (see what happens when she reads a poem in school) and the additional information about the world of magic is very well done.<br />An excellent continuation of the series.  I look forward to more.	2003-10-08

But there was always something missing from the time line.  What happened to Buffy after setting fire to the school gym and before arriving in Sunnydale?<br />This book tries to answer the question.  Here again is Pike, Buffy's companion in slaying.  Together they discover a lot of vampires coming to LA from Vegas.  Buffy decides she must see what is going on.  In the shadows, Angel watches and gains more respect for this slayer's abilities.<br />A fun story with decent illustrations that fills in a critical hole in the Buffy time line.  Even if you don't normally read the Buffy comics, this is a good chapter to read.	2003-10-07

In the first book, he fought off Beelzebub who wanted to destroy the graveyard.<br />Now Michael has a new battle to fight.  Now he owes a huge sum in taxes on the property and the IRS is after him.  Abbey, Nessie and the others try to help out in their own ways to raise the necessary funds.<br />Some schemes involve a celebrity boxing match between two of the biggest boneyard inhabitants and a swimsuit issue (issue of what?).<br />Moore ties his elements together with clear plotting and a clean drawing style.  Only two real downsides in this volume.  The first is that it is a smaller format than the first.  The second is that the plot does not conclude at the end, but sets up a nice cliffhanger.<br />Make sure to read the first Boneyard book before reading this one.  You also might want to check out Moore's Far West.	2003-10-02

What would you do if the land was in a town that is always beneath a dark cloud?  What would you do if the land was a graveyard?  What if the graveyard was inhabited by a collection of supernatural beings?  And what if the local sheriff has rallied the town into wanting to destroy the property?<br />Well, it probably won't happen to you but it does to Michael Paris, star of this wonderful dark comedy.<br />Clean black and white illustrations and unique characters really help move this story along.  Right from the start we are rooting for Michael and the boneyard inhabitants.  The story ends in a good fashion (no silly rabbit out of hat ending here) and leaves the reader wanting more Moore.<br />If you like this one, you will also like Moore's Far West.	2003-10-02

His wife will be in labor any moment and there is a vicious killer loose in the city.  It is also the anniversary of a pivotal point in his career and the city.<br />Vimes corners the killer on the roof of the library of unseen university and a lightning bolt sends both of them back 30 years (monks do not do this like stated on the back of the book).<br />Moments after their arrival in the past, history has been changed.  Carcer (the killer) has killed a man that helped Vimes learn how to be a copper.  But the Monks of Time, at least a certain monk with a broom from THE THIEF OF TIME, wants to set things right in an unusual way.<br />Pratchett is in top form as he pokes fun at just about everything while keeping the dark things dark (after all, there is nothing really funny about a serial killer).  All of this is done in a Les Miserables setting of impending revolution.<br />I do not know how Pratchett feels about Vimes.  He has said that Granny Weatherwax was his favorite character but it is obvious that he really cares a lot about Vimes.  If you are new to the series, you should read the other night watch books first in order to get a firm understanding of the watch and the city.	2003-10-01

One part shows the extremely romantic Rose and Jimbo.  Few couples can match their love and romance.  The other part concerns their son Pasquale and being a little boy in a loving family.  These two elements combine into one of the best strips around.<br />In this volume, the romance and kissing have been turned up.  Jimbo can not escape Rose's gravitational pull.  Rose's alter ego (the biker chick) is also back in a lot of strips.<br />One of the best collections yet.<br />Rose is Rose can appeal to both the young and old alike.  It's characters and humor are almost universal.	2003-09-30

I was not as happy after reading it.  Sure, it has the usual cast of characters and the same witty style as the others.  Certainly the jokes and stories are as good in the other volumes.<br />In fact, some of the stories and jokes ARE in the other volumes.  A large section of this book reprints the Lord of The Rings stories from an earlier volume.  One stip is even duplicated from this volume!  That's right, one of the strips is included twice!  It is almost as if the author is succumbing to his own jokes about variant covers.<br />The new material was quite good but there just wasn't enough of it.  I especially like the opening section that tries to explain what gaming is all about.	2003-09-26

He developed it while a prisoner in the war.  It enabled him to survive and become a war hero.  But the game can be addictive.  It should also never ever be played after dark as it becomes too real and can control you instead of you it.<br />The real story begins when the siblings' father is brutally murdered on his farm in an old smokehouse.  There is no sign of the killer.  Absolutely no evidence whatsoever.<br />In this time of crisis the two brothers return to the farm where their sister still lives.  As they try to deal with the situation and their old lives, we learn more and more of the secrets that have been hidden.  The remember a time when they all lost a week of their memory as if they had jumped over the time.  But other secrets are revealed.  Dark ones.<br />It all comes together very nicely in the end in a way that far to many horror books just can't manage.  Clegg shows that he knows how to weave a story and how to finish it off properly.	2003-09-26

Her family (two airhead parents who want to climb the social ladder but don't know what rungs are) has moved in to their great uncle's home to aid in his ailing health.  It is a spooky old mansion and Courtney notices some of the Night Things lurking about.<br />Courtney does not make friends easily but also does not take things lying down.  In this first collection we see Courtney face her first four challenges:<BR>Extortion and goblins<BR>A botched attempt at witchcraft<BR>A Changeling<BR>A doppelganger<br />But Courtney rises to all occasions although she sometimes gets a little help from the Great Uncle who has plenty of his own secrets.<br />The stories are drawn, well, dark.  They have atmosphere and character when so many comics don't.  But while they are drawn in a dark manner and the subject matter can be unusual, these are not dark tales.  Courtney is too strong-headed for that to happen.<br />My one complaint is the lack of noses.  This is not too bad except in profile (when Courtney looks like a turtle).  Otherwise it is a very well written set of tales and I am anxious to read more.	2003-09-26

The characters from the first seven books are no longer part of the story (although there are some references to a couple of them).  Although this is a new cycle, it is best to read the other seven books first (Area 51, The Reply, The Mission, The Sphinx, The Grail, Excalibur, The Truth).<br />The aliens have been defeated in the first cycle.  Alien controls are gone.  That leaves an opening for others who have waited long; the Undead.  The Undead have been half-human half-aliens that were created to be fed on.  But some of these Undead escaped.  Most notable were Nosferatu and Vampyr.<br />As the Undead begin their plans to find true immortality, not that the Grail has been destroyed, we are then treated to their history for the past 10,000 years and how they have affected world history.<br />Eventually the story reaches the present where the Undead move their plans into action.  A tense and fast-paced race begins until the very final sentences.<br />One of the better paced stories of the series.  One that does not rely heavily on sudden revelation, but instead builds nicely on the history created in the first seven books.  If you read the first seven for the story, you will love this one, but if you read them for the characters you may be a little disappointed in their absence.	2003-09-23

An unusual cast and setting, but it works (I am convinced that it helped to inspire Disney's Finding Nemo).<br />In this new volume we encounter such story arcs as:<br />Sherman becomes a cartoonist<BR>The Lagoon Tribune<BR>An underwater Renaissance fair<BR>Hawthorne's Coffee Shop<BR>Fillmore Reads every book in existence<BR>A NYC sewer alligator visits the lagoon<BR>Megan's cable cooking show<br />Lots of laughs from this wonderful cast of characters.

Bramwell and the other stuffed animals decide to get him back.<br />What follows is a series of failed attempts to reach the attic until finally one succeeds and the toys are united.<br />I like this story because it does show the process of thinking through a problem as well as perseverance (even when Duck thinks there is no hope).  As with many children's books there are a few logic problems, but overall it reads very well.<br />Look for the other Little Bear stories as well.	2003-09-22

For two weeks the boys work hard to earn the yellow sled and finally their mother takes them to the store to buy it.<br />While waiting for their mother, the boys meet another boy who is sad as he wants a yellow sled but his family has no money.

There is still plenty to be revealed in future books.  Interaction between Gaia and Jake shows that the Super Edition is definitely not part of the main series.  A good series that has not lost it's edge.	2003-09-16

Their mother tells them it is a good idea and will pay them for each basket they fill.<br />The girls go out the next morning but the quest for strawberries takes them far from home.

It started off as a school project.  The idea is to list laws that seem very strange, dumb or just plain off-the-wall.  It could have been a good book but it needs a little more research.<br />Each page has a catchy phrase about some law.  The title of the book is one such phrase.  There is then some of the text of the law it refers to.  Unfortunately, sometimes the blurb is actually the direct opposite of the law given.  I found this to be really unforgivable in such a book.  Very often I got the idea that the authors just didn't understand the language used in the laws and sometime I felt they never read them in the first place.<br />Still, there are some dumb laws that they did get right.  But really, there should have been a lot more attention paid before this ever saw print.	2003-09-15

It seems to be during an economic dry-spell as the government needs to subsidize everyone.  Subsidies are withdrawn for an entire community if there are pregnancies.<br />In this story we meet a young girl who has been found to be in possession of prenatal vitamins.  A vigilante group known as the Baby Squad moves in to discover if the girl is pregnant and where the vitamins came from.  The girl tries to convince her source to turn themselves in.  An that is the beginning of the roller-coaster ride that is this book.<br />At the heart of all this is State Investigator Ryan Lee, a man who was born naturally and without the genetic benefits of laboratory birth.  He is a very interesting character and one of the better ones I have encountered in recent reading.  He efficiently manages to uncover the web of deceit, cover-ups, and all sorts of pregnancy-related crime.<br />I would probably have give this book five stars, but part of me really wanted to know how things had created such a world and just how children were really created.  Diapers and bassinets are illegal so I really don't understand how people who apply and are approved for children actually get them.  The one clue we get is that it seems there is some sort of accelerated growth as a couple who were recently approved now have a teenager.<br />But even with a lack of background to the world, this is a very entertaining book.  You will find yourself rooting for Ryan Lee and Natalie Ross while trying to figure out how it can be pulled off.	2003-09-15

The two animals scamper around the house with the mouse naming common household items.  But eventually the mouse remembers that there is something else in a people house.  People!  The two animals return to the outdoors.<br />Plenty of vocabulary words that children should be familiar with (although some may not be familiar with a telephone with a dial).  This is great for helping children learn to read.  The words are large and clear (not small and on a dark background like in some books), thus making it even easier to learn.	2003-09-11

At her side is Phil, a bear of unknown breed.  Meg is very good at her job and is between jobs.<br />But events after a poker game draw her into the hunt for elf bad guy Voss.  She is not the only one after him, but she's the most likely to succeed.  Although there's a mighty big dragon that might have a thing or two to say about it.<br />A fun story that is beautifully drawn in black and white.  I love Phil as he plays a great straight-man.

Of an original 50,000 children, only 800 survived the journey to be sold into slavery.  Some of those survivors managed to flee to a magic land where all their dreams and desires were answered.<br />Now one of those children has come to our world in order to convince Timothy to come and help them.  Other powerful children from other worlds have already been brought there.  Upon arrival, Timothy discovers that all is not well in paradise.  There are squabbles and some things don't work they way they used to.<br />Eventually the real plot is revealed and Timothy triumphs without actually doing anything (he literally just stood there).  As a result, Timothy has found that through bumbling he has managed to now save two worlds; this one and Faerie.<br />This book is a fast read (short with large type) but it just doesn't seem to work as well as it should.  After three mediocre books I just don't think this series is going to take off (and I love the comics).	2003-09-10

Instead, he wants to play, snack, drink, get hugged, have a blanket, etc.<br />Many parents will recognize what Biscuit is doing, avoiding sleep and getting more \\"mommy time.\\"  But in the end, what Biscuit winds up with is to be asleep but not in his own bed, but near the little girl.<br />Adorable illustrations really make this a fun book for children (sometimes I have my daughter read Biscuit's part, \\"Woof, woof!\\").

Baba is right.<br />Nikki goes out to play and almost immediately drops one of the mittens.  This is where the two stories come in.  The main story is told in the large illustrations on each page as a series of animals squeeze themselves into the mitten.  In the borders of each page, we see Nikki as he plays and ultimately disturbs each of the animals so that they leave their homes and eventually find the mitten.<br />The stories cross as a sneeze blasts the animals out of the mitten and we see Nikki retrieve it in the main illustrations while the borders show the animals returning to their homes.  Baba sees Nikki reach up and catch the mitten as it drops from the sky, but she is puzzled when she sees that one mitten is now much larger than the other.<br />Absolutely beautiful illustrations.  A simple story but full of fun as we see how each of the animals enters the story.	2003-09-09

Snipp, Snapp, and Snurr, the three Swedish boys, are hungry one day and ask their mother for some buttered bread.  But there is no butter.  The boy must have their bread plain.<br />In order for the boys to get butter, they will need milk.  but the cow isn't giving any because the grass is brown because the sun has not been shining.<br />Snipp, Snapp, and Snurr appeal to the sun and tell it that it needs to shine and make the grass green.  Their appeal is heard and eventually there is butter for their bread again.<br />Each pair of pages has story on the left and an illustration painted by the author on the right.

But then the first was based on a tragedy while this was based on a comedy.<br />Love is in the air at Globe University (and so are glowing orange fireballs).  But not all the love is reciprocal.  Then there is the spooky carnival that just moved in.  To make matters worse, the wacky professor of a sexuality course has paired up the students into difficult couples and assigned then to a parenting exercise at the carnival.<br />At the carnival, it may not be Hell that breaks loose, but there are definitely some very strange goings on.  And what are all these strange creatures?<br />To learn more and how it all relates to the original classic, you will have to read more.  Warning, although this is not a tragedy, there is a body count and some gruesome scenes (but you probably expected that from the stereotypical teen-horror cover).	2003-09-09

This is a tale of a small bunny who says he is going to run away from home.  His mother tells him she will pursue him.<br />For instance, the bunny says he will become a fish and swim away.  The mother says she will become a fisherman and catch him.  Each of these pairs is done illustrated with a black and white drawing (very nicely done) and a color spread (too garish and lacking the detail of the black and whites).<br />In the end, the bunny's spirit is defeated and he resolves himself to staying home with his mother (Well then, I might as well just stay home).  The underlying message is that you can not get away from your mother so you may as well not even try.<br />This is my opinion, my wife's, and the four grandparents'.  Friends with children have agreed with us about the depressing nature of this so-called classic.  There are plenty of better books out there for our children.	2003-09-05

I actually only picked it up after the second Bard's Blood book came out.<br />Cameron Dean is a football star at Globe University.  His father is dead and his mother is shacking up with his father's sister (Aunt Claudia).  Messed up as that is, he suddenly finds himself heir to four-billion dollars and a castle in Denmark.  But he cant collect until his 21st birthday (just a few weeks away).<br />Cameron decides to invite the team (and their sweeties) to the castle for his birthday.  Nearly a hundred people head out for the party including comic relief Rosenberg and Gyllenhal.<br />But the castle has a secret as Ophelia's ghost rises from her peat-bog grave intending to destroy all love in the castle and reclaim Hamlet (his soul is tied to Cameron's).<br />Ophelia is an interesting character as she finds herself able to possess the bodies of women.  The side effect is that she is changed by them and begins to think in more modern terms (a clever trick by the author so he would not have to match her personality to Shakespeare's original).<br />Like the play it purports to be a sequel to, this book is a tragedy.  But all of the cute little Shakespearian references were quite entertaining and while there is some gore involved, most of the imagery is more classic ghost tale.<br />I am looking forward to more in the series.	2003-09-05

Boats, cars, trains, etc. merely improve people's ability to walk, run and swim.  But flight has always been something completely new.<br />Dave Young shows how flight had many roots in the Chicago area (the Wright brothers studied the work of Octave Chanute) and them fully blossomed.  Since the early days of airports, Chicago has always, except for a short period, had the world's busiest airport (first Chicago Municipal/Midway, O'Hare and then O'Hare again).  It is no wonder that aviation has such a rich history in Chicago.<br />The rich history is illustrated and illuminated by wonderful and rare photos that captivate the reader.  A wonderful book that was well worth the wait.  Get this one and Lynch's Chicago's Midway Airport: The First 75 Years and you will know it all.	2003-09-05

None of the adults in my family who have read this book like it.<br />The book it a rhythmic poem.  First we learn about what is in a little room and then we say good night to those things (Good-night, Mush?).  The artwork, like in the author's Runaway Bunny, is better in the black and white drawings than it is in the color panels.<br />The Rhythm can be relaxing if read properly and its completist use of phonic makes it good for children to read themselves, but otherwise I just don't get this book.	2003-09-05

Being familiar with the interactive classic Pat the Bunny, I was drawn right into this one.<br />Simply put, it uses Pat the Bunny-style illustrations and rhymes to show the differences between two generations.  One is monied and affluent while the new generation has much bleaker prospects (remember to give the money back after you pat it).<br />Everyone I have shown this too has laughed out loud.  You probably will too.  Check it out.	2003-09-05

Seeing as my daughter loves dogs I had to buy this when I saw it in this new edition.<br />An opera singer has moved into the house next to Harry's.  The singer practices all day long, singing loud and high.  Harry does not like this sound.  Harry tries a number of ways to get her to stop.  These do not please his family.  But finally, a good way is found and everyone is happy.<br />As a parent, one of the things I like about this book is that it is clear that Harry is not being good when he howls, leads cows or a marching band, or other tricks.  Although we want Harry to succeed, we also want it to be in the right and good way.  This book knows the difference.<br />I loved this book as a kid and I still do.  My daughter loves it (hopefully my son will too).	2003-09-04

In fact, the book ends in a way that it seems the characters don't want to find out or never will (future books may tell).  But that is one of the things I liked about this one.  The reader may know what is going on but we know there must still be surprises in store for the characters.<br />Like the previous books, a lot happens.  People leave, relationships form, break, develop.<br />The one real disappointment I had was with Morgan's defense training.  It is extremely important but just never gets around to happening.  Will we see more in the next book?  We'll have to read it and see.<br />Another good book in the series and this one leaves enough open at the end to send you right to the next one.	2003-09-03

As the dogs are added (a new one on each page), they begin to form a doggie pyramid.  Once complete, all ten dogs, a cat shows up to take their picture.  You can guess what happens to that pile of puppies!<br />I am not sure why it was done this way, but as each dog is added, you actually look at it's picture on the next page through a small round hole (it seems to me that all it really adds is production costs).<br />A fun book, particularly for children who like dogs.  The breeds are recognizable (there is a key on the back for those who don't know the breeds already) and the dogs move around from picture to picture with the Doberman being the most animated.  Heavy board pages add durability to the pictures.	2003-09-03

Meanwhile, T.J. has become interested in being the new editor for the school paper.  Add a boy or two to the mix (and a little snogging) and you get the idea.<br />Although better than the first two books, it is nowhere near as good as the Louise Rennison books.  But I am glad to see that as with the third, this series is no longer trying to imitate the Rennison books.<br />If you liked the earlier ones, you will surely like this one as it is one of the two best in the series (Designer Divas being the other).	2003-09-02

However, I was surprised that this third volume was better than the other two.<br />This time we are treated to Nesta's viewpoint and it actually does seem to be a different voice than Lucy and Izzie.  I even cracked a smile at one point (although no actual laughter).<br />Nesta has met a new snoggable boy on the train.  The hit it off quite well and they begin dating.  Unfortunately, he is much richer than Nesta and has a snotty sister and even snottier ex.  To make it worse, Nesta's home life is not as it should be as employment trouble forces a tightening of the belts.<br />Well, Nesta undergoes all of the usual self-doubt that this type of novel is all about, but with some help from her friends, and her family, she manages to get through it.<br />Although better than the first two books, it is nowhere near as good as the Louise Rennison books.  I did notice that with this volume, the series no longer feels like it is trying to imitate the Rennison books.<br />If you liked the first two, you will love this one.

But most are relatively contemporary.  The stories cover beasts of all types, wild, supposedly civilized, loving, hateful, lesser, greater, and just about anything you can think of.<br />I found myself flying through these stories.

Deep woods and house breaking are elements familiar to Laymon fans.  In this book Laymon manages to combine the two in an interesting way.<br />The book opens with two separate stories that eventually twist together into an unpredictable knot.  One story involves a comfortably wealthy young woman who likes to live in other peoples houses.  Without their knowledge.  The other story is about a couple going camping.  Sounds simple enough.<br />But he young woman has found the house of a dangerous character and begins to be less careful about discovery.  The couple contains a man who had a very bad experience in the woods when he was a boy.<br />Paranoia, new characters popping up, suspense, possible clues and plenty of Laymon twists keep the reader turning pages to find out what happens (or doesn't happen) next.<br />Many of Laymon's books deal with the theme of how easy someone can turn totally dark when something breaks society's control.  This one is a little different.  The evil characters are already evil when they walk onto the stage.  Instead, we are treated to a story of people who have witnessed said evil in the past and now look for it as they know it can still be out there.<br />But despite the change of view, this is definitely a book for Laymon fans.	2003-08-27

Eve, Merilynn and Samantha met at a summer cheerleading camp and then again eight years later at Greenbrier college (second only to Sunnydale for disappearing students).<br />Now we get Samantha's viewpoint as Mallory Thomas, head of the sorority and its secret society, the Fata Morganas, tries to further increase her powers through sacrifices to the Forest Knight.<br />We lean a lot about the histories of many characters, who they are and how they came to be.  We also see the end of some (I'll let you find out who).  But in the end it all comes nicely together and ties up into a tidy little package that leaves the reader satisfied.  We are not left with annoying loose ends like in many horror books.  While any chance of a sequel would have to be vastly different from the series (unless it is a prequel), there are references to other Tamara Thorne books (Bad Things, Moonfall, etc.).<br />A fun horror book in the Buffy vein and a nice conclusion to the trilogy.	2003-08-27

But when Jim stomps off in stubbornness, he falls into the pool.  Once in the water, he remembers how much fun it is and begins swimming and playing with the other children.<br />The Jim books all center around stubbornness and rhymes.  All of the other kids mentioned in this book provide plenty of fun material for the rhymes (now everything doesn't rhyme with Jim).<br />My daughter loves this book and recognizes Jim from This Is Jane Jim (Jim gets a new baby sister).  The artwork is simple, colorful and consistent.  If you like Dr. Seuss's rhyming patterns, you will probably enjoy the Jim books.	2003-08-27

The International Council of Witches believes that an evil witch is going to sacrifice his son to increase his powers.  This allows Morgan and Hunter to go (along with his sister Sky and her girlfriend Raven).  Bree and Robbie also go as Bree's father has a place they can stay in the city.<br />Morgan also tries to use the time to learn more about her mother (she had lived in New York City for a couple of years).<br />But everything changes when the evil witch rears his head and tires to kill Morgan and not his son Killian.<br />Well, there are plenty more books in the series so you probably know that Morgan survives but you will have to read it to find out about the others.  There are personal and relationship developments aplenty and some plot twists and revelations that help set up the next few books.<br />A pretty good addition to the series.	2003-08-27

Because of Morgan's history, the International Council of Witches asks her to risk everything to try and get closer to the source of the evil (the evil witch who tried to kill her in New York City).<br />To do so, Morgan witch calls Killian to come and see her.  He shows and his exuberant personality takes Morgan and her coven on a roller coaster ride of partying.  But eventually Morgan does run into the evil witch and more plot developments follow.<br />This is really the first time that Morgan is going up against a threat not targeting her specifically.  Somehow she must help the Council, avoid detection, keep her grades from slipping further, deal with Hunter and maybe, just maybe, get a chance to breathe.<br />Some reviewers feel that the series weakens after book 7 but I feel that this one shows a nice maturing of the story.  Having Morgan acting  and not just reacting is a pleasant change.  I do look forward to the next book.<br />This is the first	2003-08-27

As each gate is destroyed, the local building is melted.  This includes Piper's club P3.  If enough gates are destroyed, the magic wall between the worlds will fail and the world will end.<br />It all comes down to the book.  The real De Vermis Mysteriis is a creation of Robert Bloch (author of Psycho).  It is linked to the Cthulhu Mythos of H. P. Lovecraft.  In this book, however, all has been changed.  It was written by on of the De Vermis twins as a collection of good magic.  But then it got corrupted.  This would have worked better for me if the authors had not used a known book with a definite history.  All they would have had to do was make up a title.<br />I found very little suspense in the plot and the resolution was very contrived (even for Charmed).  I was almost rooting for the sisters to fail so that the world would end.  Probably the worst book in the series.	2003-08-13

She is flat-chested, has hippies for parents (or so she says), and is facing the whole boy scene.<br />As in Rennison's books, she falls for a guy who thinks she might be two young, takes kissing lessons from a guy, even admits to making hammocks our of sanitary pads.  Unlike Rennison, the story is told in a first-person narrative and not a diary.  Lucy's life is not really crazy enough (or at all) for real laughs and comes out as overall bland.<br />If you are looking for a book that will have you laughing out loud, this is not the one.

It is not convincing that it is a different voice (although the scenery has changed).<br />I have to say that this one was even blander than the first book.  At least Lucy's angst was more believable.  Izzie really has no issues in this book (other than when will her guy call), so although longer than the first, it has less to the story.<br />For laughter, stick with Rennison, as this one will not even crack a smile.	2003-08-11

Many favorite characters are back (even Sam, this big dog).<br />I fell the book may not teach exactly what love is (how many of us really know that?) but it does give practical advice that is accessible by children.<br />Fun book, great illustrations.  A must for biscuit fans.	2003-08-04

She is relieved to know she was not responsible for someone's death.<br />In her confusion she must learn to try and trust Hunter and even his cousin Skye.  What she learns makes her more confused.<br />Final confrontations reveal much about the characters and their plans.  It is a good and tense story.  Can't wait to see what happens next.	2003-08-01

But when night falls, Jim has a chance to tell the crying baby what is what.  But in the moonlight, little Jane smiles at Jim and the two become fast friends.<br />This is one of a number of \\"new baby\\" books our daughter read before she had a little brother.

But not all is as dark as it seems and there is even a very funny twist at the end.<br />I have shown this book to a lot of adults and they all have enjoyed it and found it funny.  A good book about not seeming to fit in.<br />Hint: Like with many Boynton books, read the dedication at the front, it's funny.	2003-07-29

During an argument with her parents who want her to stop her Wicca studies, she confronts them with the blood witch idea.  They deny it and she finally learns that she was adopted.<br />The rest of the book has Morgan trying to come to terms with her adoption, the fact she wasn't told about it, her relationship with Cal Blaire and possibly ex-friend Bree.  All this while also learning about her powers and that not everyone in the world of magic is friendly.<br />A very nice book that really surprised me in how well it was written, how the characters act, and some of the subjects brought up.

The animals are mustly bugs and arachnids but there are also a Komodo dragon and a gecko for example.<br />The designs are pleasing to the eye (the Komodo dragon is my favorite) but most are not for people who have anything against cutting the paper.  Some use more than one piece.  I don't have a real problem with this.<br />The only real problem I have is that some of the insects (i.e. praying mantis) have eight legs instead of six.  It is common in origami to simplify an animal by reducing the number of legs.  This is the first time I have encountered designs where there are too many legs.<br />Still, as long as no one is counting, they are very nice designs and easy for children to do.	2003-07-28

Just sing it to the tune of the ABC song (also the same tune as Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, and Baa Baa Black Sheep).<br />The rhymes, the singing, the pictures, all come together to make this a wonderful book, one that really helped my daughter learn the alphabet.<br />With this book and Sandra Boyntons ABC book (Aardvark admiring, Beavers ballooning, Cats cleaning, etc.), learning the alphabet will be fun fun fun.	2003-07-28

Officer Buckle knows more about safety than anyone else.  He gives talks about his tips to remain safe.  Unfortunately his talks fall on deaf ears.  Safety is just not interesting.<br />But then the force acquires a new police dog named Gloria.  Gloria accompanies Officer Buckle to a talk.  While Officer Buckle recites his list of safety tips, Gloria performs tricks to illustrate them.  But Officer Buckle does not know Gloria is doing anything.<br />Suddenly the safety talks are a hit and Officer Buckle and Gloria are appearing everywhere.  Then Officer Buckle sees himself on the news.  He also sees what Gloria has been doing.  He is not happy.<br />But by the end of the book, Officer Buckle and Gloria have learned their lessons and that teamwork is key to the success of the safety program.<br />Boy did my daughter love this book when I read it to her last night.  She loves dogs and Gloria's antics were pure entertainment.  She caught on to the teamwork message as well as some of the safety tips (most of which are visible as notes in the illustrations).  She also liked the pictures (no gorillas or hamsters making appearances) especially Gloria signing autographs while Officer Buckle buys some ice cream.<br />A fun book that teaches some good lessons in a way children will follow.

They pull a Hitchcockian maneuver where they each play pranks on one of the others' foes.  But then things get out of hand.<br />In this sequel, the school hosts a new student.  He is impossibly good at anything he tries.  He has bested all of the best.  Now the best are second best.  Then the pranks starts and everyone thinks it is the work of The Shadow Club.<br />Jared, the ex-leader of the ex-club comes under the heaviest suspicion.  He must work to try and clear his name but learns that no matter what you do, people will think what they want.<br />Is it an impossible task?  Maybe.  But you will have to read how Jared deals with it and how everything plays out.  It is a page turner right to the end.<br />I remember a similar story on Disney's Recess, but here Shusterman takes the hard and serious line instead of the happy-go-lucky tone of the cartoon.  Shusterman is so straight in this book that there in not even a single mention of Ralphy Sherman.<br />An excellent book that just might be better than the original.	2003-07-22

I read Under Sea, Under Stone first in hardcover (it claimed to be first) but my wife read The Dark is Rising first.  We both enjoyed the series.<br />You really should read both before this one as the characters from the two books come together.  This is a direct sequel to the events in Under Sea, Under Stone.<br />The kids, Simon, Jane, and Barney, return to Cornwall where they meet Will Stanton (The Dark is Rising).  The Greenwich is under the sea and she has something Will needs.  Simon, Jane and Barney know what happened to the object and they combine forces to get it back.<br />This is the thinnest of the series, but it is very pivotal.  It brings together two casts and sets the stage for the rest of the series.  I found it to be one of the most enjoyable as it was rather straight forward.<br />A fun book for readers of fantasy young and old, but make sure you read the first two books first.	2003-07-22

One of her duties is the slaying of vampires.  These are not your typical vampires.  Some of them go to school with Sarah.  Not all Vampires are bad.  Some of them feel that killing is wrong and some feel that drinking human blood is wrong.<br />It is a rich and interesting world that reminds me very much of the Night World books by L. J. Smith.  If you are familiar with them and like them, then I am sure you will enjoy this book as well.<br />Sarah has just started a new school.  Sarah ir rather head-strong and does not always follow her mother's orders (her mother is chief witch, head of the line and very powerful).  This really comes out regarding two of Sarah's classmates.  They are vampires and seem to be of the \\"good variety\\".  At least she can not detect that either has had human blood.<br />So, take the structure of Night World, add a dash of Angel (read it and you will see) and you get a very entertaining book with an interesting plot and an ending you do not see coming.	2003-07-22

He was right.<br />Ten Minutes to Bedtime is a wonderful book.  The main character is a young child with a pet hamster.  The hamster runs the Hamster 10-Minute Bedtime Tour.  Well, as the book opens we see the first of the tour arrive.<br />There are not many words in this story (unless you read the newspaper the father is reading), but the detail in the illustrations is superb.<br />I have to recommend that readers do several things.  First of all, you must read the article and ads in the father's newspaper.  Next, pay attention to the first family (the kids all have outfits with numbers).  Look at everything in the pictures!  I was very pleasantly surprised by some of the details I found going on in the pictures (my daughter was worried about the kid's slippers).<br />Buy it!  Read it!  Study it!

While I liked the way the classic story had been made more urban in order to be more associational for many readers, I was disappointed in two places.<br />The first is a little trivial, when the Hen needs cheese, it mentions all the cheese she has, including string cheese, but no mozzarella.  Unfortunately, string cheese is mozzarella.<br />But my real problem is that the original moral of the story, that the lazy animals do not benefit from the Hen's hard work.  Instead they all get some pizza and are guilt-tripped into helping clean up.<br />While I can accept the change in scenery (and pizza instead of bread), I have a hard time accepting that the moral has been changed.	2003-07-21

Phoebe has a dream about a hidden letter in the attic.  The letter is real.  It is from an ancestor and warns against a fake sister who will come into the home after the death of another sister.  This seems to point to Paige.<br />Because she had the dream, Phoebe wants to learn more.  Piper just writes it off.  The guys also take sides, although Leo does orb off to do some checking.<br />Meanwhile Paige does not know what is going on in the house but meets a new guy.  She really likes him although some of her instincts tell her she trusts him too much.<br />To make matters worse, there is a really nasty killer loose on the streets.  He might be connected to a newly discovered cache of bones left by another killer 100 years previously.  Yes, I know, there are shades of The Cabinet of Curiosities by Preston and Child, but they end there.<br />There are two things that bother me about the book.  One is the way the Law of No Coincidences is ignored so heavily.  This might be due to a spell placed on the household, and although it is mentioned as a possibility, it is never confirmed.  There is also talk of doing a counter spell, but that is also never finalized satisfactorily.<br />The other problem I had was with the ever-so-tired overused plot where one sister has a secret boyfriend who turns out to be the bad guy.  This has been so overdone in the series and in the books that it is just tiresome.<br />I will say that unlike the last book, there are no one-time major revelations (i.e. a new facet to Phoebe's power).  For that reason I enjoyed it even if some of the story was too old hat.	2003-07-17

No one knew it was special.  Not until a disturbed genius gets a hold of it via fraud.  The rock can superconduct at room temperature (currently we can only do this at about -250 F).  When his superior points out that the discovery will be credited to the boss, the scientist kills him.<br />Now we have a \\"worlds most famous cave explorer\\" leading a NASA mission to train on mining on the Moon.  The training ground will be Labyrinth cave, a mammoth cave discovered by the explorer in 2000.<br />But then the scientist escapes prison and heads for the same cave system.  Seems he used to play in it as a boy and he hid the moon rock there before he was caught.  NASA does not know their missing rock is in the cave.<br />Just as the NASA mission starts, the escaped convicts arrive and take over.  They need the explorer to guide them to the cave areas the scientist knows.  To ensure cooperation, they have his 14-year-old daughter as hostage (yeah, NASA let her come along).<br />The race is on.  There is the race for the rock, the race for the rescue and the race against a storm that is coming and could cause flooding in the cave.  To make matters worse, when lightning strikes, the rock amplifies it and causes an earthquake.  Apparently during the years the rock was hidden, no lightning ever struck the mountains.  Right!<br />The ending is typical of the genre, no matter how prepared at the start, all weapons are gone at the end and there is a fist fight.  Even the \\"surprise\\" ending was no surprise.<br />Examples of the bad writing:<BR>When faced with the criminals, Tom the explorer does this.  \\"Tom blanched.  He understood that he was facing not men but animals.  That understanding triggered the survivor instinct in him, an instinct honed over years spent navigating the bowels of the Earth.  He felt himself turn to iron inside.  He looked around at them all.  \\"You sick bastards.  I promise you, you'll pay--\\" at which point one of the bad guys backhands him to the ground.  Boy, that kind of survivor instinct could cause you to walk into traffic.<BR>At a later point as one of the bad guys is bathed in the brilliance of the stone, it is remarked that his skin turned opaque and that you could see the shadows of bones and webs of veins.  Not by any definition of opaque.  That means you CAN'T see through something.<br />Labyrinth cave is located near Mammoth cave, although separate.  The author seems unaware of Mammoth cave's true expanse (it was discovered that it was actually joined to other systems and thus much larger than originally thought).  Some of the Labyrinth cave galleries have the same names as those in Mammoth cave.  The rescue team seems to go through completely different terrain from their quarry even when following footprints.  Bad.<br />The reader is left with 400 pages of mediocre to bad writing, a pointless plot without proper repercussions, no real drama, just a bunch of scenes strung together with descriptions of rock formations.	2003-07-15

There are more references to the Greenjacks (see Bad Things by Tamara Thorne) and the Green Knight, a local spirit.<br />Like in the first volume, the action moves very quickly as the character handle the events of the first volume.  The freshmen are wondering what is going on while the Fata Morgan try to increase their powers.<br />As the book ends, we are set up very nicely for the concluding volume.

Suddenly, it is eight months later and everything is hunky dory.  What happened?  So much of the book is grounded in real science and theory that the \\"rabbit out of the hat\\" ending was just too cheap.  My advice is to read the book and avoid the epilog; just make up your own ending.<br />The book centers around a race for what could be one of the greatest medical discoveries of all time; a method to stimulate regeneration of limbs.<br />A team of scientists and Army Rangers is hot on the trail but they are followed by mercenaries in the pay of a French pharmaceutical company.  To make matters worse, the initial discovery, a soldier whose arm regenerated while he was missing in the jungle, has caused the spread of a terrible plague, one with a %100 kill rate.  Now the first team has to find their objectives and find a cure for the plague.  All this while having to survive mercenaries, local Indians, giant crocodiles, killer life forms and the jungle itself.<br />A real page turner until you turn the page and see \\"Eight months later\\".	2003-07-09

It is larger by far than any known meteorite and by rights should not exist.  Obtaining it will be an engineering feat of the grandest scale.  The rock weighs as much as five Eiffel towers and would be the heaviest object ever moved by humanity.<br />The rock lies on a small island in Cape Horn at the southernmost tip of South America.  Freezing weather, unforseen circumstances, engineering on the grandest scale, international politics, and an obsessive destroyer captain all come together to make this a true thriller.<br />Of course, it would not be Preston and Child if there were not some very curious details about the rock itself (you'll have too read it to find out as I won't spoil the surprise).  It then all culminates in a satisfying ending with an unpredictable twist.<br />Fans of science thrillers will definitely want to read this one.	2003-07-03

The highlight of the book is the incomparable Special Agent Pendergast (the modern Sherlock Holmes).<br />At a construction site, 36 bodies are found that have been buried for over 100 years.  Enter Agent Pendergast who enlists Nora Kelly, now of the Museum of Natural History, and the train ride begins.<br />The bodies were the victims of a notorious serial killer, a mad doctor.  But now similar killings are beginning to occur.  The original killings were part of a scheme to prolong life.  Apparently someone is duplicating that work.  Or did the original killer succeed and is still at work?  Only by reading the book will you discover the answers.<br />It has been a long time since a book flew by as quickly as this one did.  At slightly over 600 pages, it felt like less than half that.  The action and tight plotting make the pages turn very quickly.<br />This is one of the best novels Preston and Child have turned out together.  If you have enjoyed any of their earlier work, then you will surely enjoy this one.	2003-06-27

Short chapters and changing viewpoints keep the pages turning.  Unfortunately the actual writing is often crude and obtuse.<br />There are times it seems the narrator/character has already read the book she is in. Notably, when entering a facility she first enters a room containing only lockers with neatly hung scrubs. There are some empty offices and even an empty coffee mug.  For some reason she refers to the place as \\"a place of horror and madness.\\"  The description is true, but she has no evidence for it yet.<br />I was also disappointed that the plot didn't really start until about page 235.  That's a bit long for a thriller to take off.  I admit, I kept reading to that point wondering when it WOULD take off.<br />The characters are quite interesting although I feel some of the first 200 pages could have been tightened up or even eliminated.  Do we really need the scene where the FBI agent watches the Veterinarian strip through a window (he never tells her that he had been watching)?<br />Still, I bet many people will like this one.  At least the reader doesn't have to plod through anything as short chapters usually do speed things along.	2003-06-24

Eve wants to be a great cheerleader.  A cheerleading camp she has repeatedly attended is run by cheerleaders from Greenbrier College and all from the same sorority.<br />Years ago at the camp, Eve has a spooky experience on Applehead Island, a small protrusion in a lake that stands where a town once did.<br />Now Eve is at Greenbrier College and pledging the sorority.  But the sorority has secrets.  There is supposedly an inner group known as the Fata Morgana who are very powerful.  What Eve doesn't know is that the rumors are true but don't tell even half the story.<br />The Fata Morgan is a coven of very powerful witches and they have marked the virginal Eve for a ceremony that will increase their power.<br />A fast and spooky read with hints and revelations coming at a good pace.  There is even reference to Santo Verde from BAD THINGS (the college is located in another place that is greener than usual).<br />If you liked BAD THINGS, CANDLE BAY or some of her other books, you will probably really enjoy this one.  The only problem is that the trilogy will only be about as long as one of her other novels, so it is a very quick read.	2003-06-18

On a distant planet, after a short brutal war, a woman general finds herself the ranking leader in the country.  She has received orders to go into hiding and remain safe until it is the right time to strike back.  Hiding goes against her nature, but the rest of the staff comply and have her surgically altered to be human and then ship her off to Earth.<br />Ket Mulhar lands in California where she is promptly picked up by an aging golf-loving couple and her new life as Kathy begins.  The couple have a son who is in the movie business and Kathy is soon working for him and making him more successful.<br />Meanwhile, the resistance begins to form on her home planet and a war of rebellion begins.  The aggressors want to know where Ket is and why she has not shown herself.<br />The rest of the book is a true delight.  Action passes back and forth between planets.  Kathy develops a new life, first as a script girl and then as a producer.  But Kathy is very honest.  She has told the couple who befriended her who she is.  Bobby, their son, is also told.   Bobby, his parents, and his friends are all veterans (WWII and Desert Storm).<br />Needless to say, everyone takes a real shine to Kathy and we get a story of Family and friends sticking together and doing everything they need to in order to protect their own.<br />With General Ket in charge, you expect a big smash explosive battle ending, but this book is more intelligent than that.<br />I will leave revelations of endings to the readers as friend and foe all come together in the Californian desert.<br />A wonderful read that is pretty much unlike anything else out there.

She remembers looking for muggers in the park.  Someone was behind her, she turned, and recognized the person.  But that is all she known.<br />Gaia soon discovers that she is in a psychiatric institution in Florida.  First thought: she doesn't belong there and she needs to get out.<br />But getting out is not easy, even for someone as talented as Gaia.  Here therapist, Doctor Kraven, insists that here memories are fake and that her persona of the fearless hero is just a mental fabrication that was created so she could handle seeing her security-guard father accidently shoot her mother.<br />Yup, this is another of the \\"it's all a dream\\" stories that are so popular.  But unlike the most of the others, this one is really good.<br />Soon Gaia is accepting what the doctor says.  Her memories are coming back (with the help of electro shock therapy).  We know something must be up.<br />Other patients include her roommate, a happily adjusted space cadet, and a boy with no name who seems to refer to everything in colors.<br />The only other regular character to show up in this story is Jake although many are mentioned.<br />The plot is good and moves quickly.  There are plenty of surprises and a few revelations about Gaia's past.  I just hope these things stay in the main series.<br />One of the best Fearless books yet (although it works best with a good working knowledge of the series, it does not stand alone).  If you like Fearless, you must read this one.	2003-06-12

He knows that for Earth and humanity to survive, they need to start gaining hard alien currency.  But what could they possibly sell to the advanced aliens?<br />Shady business deals, reality checks, and interstellar trade shows combine in an intriguing plot that keeps the reader hooked all the way to the last line.<br />Fast-paced story that is low in the science and does not hit you over the head with economics and business practices even though they are a major part of the plot.<br />I would love to see a sequel.	2003-06-11

This portion of the book is handled very well (although I am not sure I agree with the way it was resolved).<br />Nita is faced with a terrible dilemma.  Her mother is terribly sick and wizardry does not seem like it can provide the answer.  But there may be a way if she gives up her ability to work magic.  That means she will also give up her oath to protect life.  She has already saved thousands, how many more would she save if she stayed with wizardry?  A dilemma indeed.<br />This story is primarily about Nita and not Kit.  To manage this, the two are estranged for a number of reasons.  First there is a minor argument.  This is resolved fairly early but the questions it raised were not dealt with.  There are references to the young wizards' work in the manual that are never resolved and seem to only hang around long enough to keep the two apart.  Even Nita's message to Kit, sent via manual, never reaches him even though it was set to keep trying to resend.<br />When Nita is deep in the worries about her mom, Kit still seems very distant even though he is supposedly committed to help her.<br />There are things going on in the book which could be of major importance to all of wizardry across the universes, but it is pursued only half-heartedly.<br />But still, Nita's dilemma is handled quite well and the reader gets a real sense of moral and personal dilemma that is seemingly insurmountable.  But too much of the other stuff detracted from the book for me to give it more than 3 stars.	2003-06-09

The book tries to center on Illinois (home of the world's busiest airport for 70 years), but it does go into broader regions (Octave Chanute in Indiana, Lindbergh, the Wrights, etc.)<br />This is a scholarly work and many will not find it an easy read.  However, the book is very well organized and has a number of photo sections that help illustrate this fascinating topic.<br />I recommend this book for serious history fans, and I recommend Chicago's Midway Airport, The First 75 Years by Christopher Lynch for the nostalgic reader.	2003-06-04

She gets her wish when a talented artist agrees to accept Hail as an apprentice.

Necromancy that will try again to resurrect the King.  Thus the King returns, not as the Empire's savior, but as a puppet tool of an outlaw baron and a necromancer.<br />Can the city and the Empire survive the return of the King?

He has a real talent for it.<br />John is being hired because other sources have said he is the one who could find the daughter.  She might be in a place called the Nightside, a strange area of London where it is always 3AM and those you run into may not be completely human.<br />John fled the Nightside five years earlier and only a very large check has made him agree to go back.<br />As the investigation moves to the Nightside, we learn that there is more to John than we may know.  A lot of tough things and people are really very scared of him.<br />The investigation progresses and we see a very interesting new world where the rules are different.  John cannot locate the daughter right away, something very powerful seems to be blocking his power.<br />On the other hand, we find out that John is the son of a man and a strange woman who was not entirely human.  She disappeared when he was young and the father committed suicide when he discovered what she was.  But John is in the dark as to who she was.  His talent for locating things is his only clue.<br />The investigation culminates in an unpredictable and satisfying way.

He has been summoned to a Swiss research facility to help investigate a murder that implicates the mysterious organization known as the Illuminati.  Langdon happens to be an expert.<br />Science and history are bent to the breaking point as we learn that a large quantity of anti-matter has been created and it has been stolen.  It turns up in the Vatican.  Supposedly the Illuminati are behind the plot and they are planning to wipe out their old foes the Catholic Church.<br />But there is a Conclave going on to appoint a new Pope and the favorites have been kidnaped from the Vatican itself.  Langdon must unravel the secrets of the Illuminati if they are to save the Cardinals and the Vatican.<br />Langdon has a mere four hours to accomplish what he has been unable to do in twenty years.  But he does anyway.  Typical Brown subplots and major twists guarantee to final answers until the final page or two.<br />I had a lot of trouble with the inaccurate science, the Captain of the Swiss Guard who will not take a threat seriously, and Langdon's ability to figure out what is going on.<br />A romance plot line is added so that Langdon can have someone else point out the not-so-obvious once in a while.<br />Still, it is a gripping book that keeps the reader hooked if only to see how things turn out (even if you can't believe it).  As for the bit about what was done \\"without sin\\", Brown seems to be unfamiliar with both the procedure and the Church's stand on one of the steps.<br />Deception Point is much better.	2003-05-28

Thus Artemis manages to capture a LEPrecon (fairy recon officer) and the battle begins.<br />Fairykind, technologically advanced way beyond humans, has no choice but to try and rescue their officer without exposing themselves to the human world.<br />The rest is a wonderful siege by the fairies of Artemis and his house until a very interesting conclusion.<br />The reader finds oneself on the side of Artemis.  Yes, he is a criminal, but he is not evil, he is merely exercising his genius.  But the reader also wants the People to not suffer.

It has been disconnected from our world for too long.  Tamlin brings Timothy back to Faerie to show him the desolation but Timothy does not understand.<br />But after another meeting with Tamlin, and a homeless man named Kenny, Timothy is faced with a new mystery.  Who is his father, really?  Is it the man he always thought was his father or is it the falconer?  Looking for answers, Timothy finds himself back in Faerie in an even more desolate spot.<br />Timothy quickly finds himself the plaything of a strange man/creature who wants to play with him and then eat him.  While trying to stay alive, Tamlin finally manages to convince Queen Titania that Faerie is in trouble and she should remove the walls she has put between Faerie and the human world.  She does, but it will not work.  Something is blocking it.<br />Meanwhile Timothy manages to get the best of his captor and finds himself visiting with Death.  No, he is not dead, but he is close.  Tamlin meanwhile finds Tim's body and takes it to Titania to be cured.<br />How all these elements tie together (who is Tim's father, how can Tamlin save Tim, will Tim leave Death's realm, will Faerie be saved, etc.) will be left for the reader.<br />Once again, this novelization lacks much of what made the comic story work.  Carla has left out many elements, ones that show Timothy's cleverness, ones that build the sinister nature of Timothy's captor, even the desolation facing Faerie.  While in the original Timothy definitely does not have the key to the worlds with him, in this version he uses it to help overcome his captor.<br />Too much was changed in this story and in the previous one.  I do not have high hopes for other volumes in the series.	2003-05-20

He is somewhat of a nebish and where spectacles.  But one day he is given the chance to learn magic, for it is his fate to possibly be the era's greatest wizard.  He quickly gains an owl for a familiar and embarks on a series of journeys to learn about magic and whether he would walk its path.<br />He begins by traveling to the past where he encounters a young Merlin.  Then he explores the present-day world and meets a number of evil wizards who would like him dead.  From there he travels the lands of Faerie where he meets Queen Titania and falls afoul of the Babba Yagga.  Then he must go into the future.  Here he sees some of white might come to pass, sees the end of everything, meets Death and survives another attempt on his life.<br />Returning to the present, Timothy must decide if he is to follow the ways of magic or remain in the mundane world.<br />This book does an adequate job of retelling the story, but despite the fact that novels can usually flesh out a comic book (more space available), this on is actually lacking much of the original story.<br />Some of the characters in the original story do not even make an appearance here.  Boston Brand (Deadman) supplied an wonderful bit of suspense and foreshadowing in the original, but here he is completely absent.  The John Constantine section lacks the wonder and thrill of the original, although an explanation is given as to how Zatana made such a big blunder.<br />Overall, not a bad book, but not as good as the original.	2003-05-19

Each story is less than a page and recounts a tale that has been told enough times that some people believe it to be true (i.e. alligators in the sewers).<br />While the topic is an interesting one, the writer's delivery is dry and sporadic.  There seem to be more details in stories set in England than elsewhere.  Overall there seems to be a strong English slant to the tales.<br />The stories are roughly grouped into categories such as Accidents, Medical, Criminal, Miscellaneous, and Sex.  Many of these seem to have been randomly place and would fit better in a different category.<br />Are they really legends?  No.  While some of the tales are classic urban legends (although in variations I have never heard before), some of the stories have other origins.  At least on tale is true and can be verified in the local papers (I won't tell you which one).  Others have been lifted straight from old movies and television shows (many decades old that is).  Maybe in England they don't know the origins of these particular tales, but American audiences will probably now where they were taken from.<br />If you are looking for a good collection of Urban Legends, this is certainly a cheap one, but it is not a particularly good one.	2003-05-16

Georgia Nicolson is back!  At the end of the first book, Georgia managed to hook up with Robbie the Sex God.  All is right with the world.  But now, we start with Georgia being told by her parents that they are probably going to move to New Zealand!  And before they move, they will spend the Summer there.  Georgia has one week before she leaves and the SG (Sex God) had to make a short trip and will return after she has left!<br />Luckily, a steam vent convinces Georgia's father that they should not move to New Zealand (it shot his boot off).  Georgia gets to stay!  But then the SG dumps her (he thinks she might be to young).  But Georgia is determined to get him back.<br />Plot follows scheme as Georgia tries to reel the SG back in while having to deal with the craziness of her life and the world around her.<br />Plenty more of the humor that made the first book so funny.  Once again I found myself laughing out loud while reading (a usually very rare occurrence).  Funny funny funny stuff.	2003-05-15

The first volume of the confessions of Georgia Nicolson.  This book is set up like a diary, but the timing and phrasing makes it read more like a transcript.  Pay attention to some of the timestamps.<br />Very few books have caused me to laugh out loud.  Only one kept me laughing all the way through.  Until now, that is.  Absolutely hilarious.<br />Georgia Nicolson is a young (almost fifteen) girl being faced with more than her share life's uncertainties and unfairness.  She has an annoying, but funny, three-year-old sister, a cat that is part Scottish wildcat that will eat just about anything, including his lead, a clueless mother, out-of-date parents, and a gang of friends that are sometimes worse than enemies.<br />Georgia must face maturing while trying to have fun, the bottomless mysteries of boys, snogging lessons, crazy teachers and a strict but crazy school.  But then one of her friends becomes enamored of Tom, a clerk in a grocer.  But Tom has a brother Robbie who, as Georgia puts it, is a Sex God.  Georgia is hooked but how can she hook him back?  What about the snogging instructor, or the whelk that put his hand...?<br />To find out the answers, you just have to read this book.  Hilarious to the end.	2003-05-15

The vision is apparently from the view of the youth.  There also seems to be a lot of fog.<br />Bt the fog in the vision is not caused by suspended water droplets.  Leo finds out that this is an example of Mist and Stone.  The mist signifies that the events in the vision are not set in stone.  Later visions have less mist, thus making the outcome more certain.<br />But to solve the mystery of the vision, the Charmed Ones must discover just what is going on with the youth and the correctional facility he has been placed in.<br />The pacing and writing are very similar to other books in the series.  But one must wonder about the Mist and Stone effect.  Usually Phoebe's visions are clear, no mist.  But they keep managing to change the outcome of these visions.  How do these differ from the M&S vision?  This is never really explained to satisfaction.  But that is o-kay as the effect could have been left out of the book entirely and it would not have hurt the plot (which did not depend on the M&S effect).<br />If you have liked the previous novels in the series, then I am sure you will like this one as it is very similar.  But if you have not liked the others then this will probably also disappoint.	2003-05-15

If you have made it this far in the series, I am sure you know what to expect.  However, this is one of the better books in recent volumes.<br />Outside of a Japanese comic book, no one can have a more messed up and topsy-turvy life than Gaia Moore.  That is very true in this book.  Let's look at some of the tangles.<br />Tom Moore - still missing but Demetrius may be able to shed some light on where he may be.<br />Demetrius - he seems to be helping Gaia without an ulterior motive, but then this is Fearless.<br />Ed Fargo - still on the outs with Gaia over the Sam Moon fiasco.<br />Sam Moon - may have tried to kill Gaia in the last book but he seems innocent.<br />Tatiana - roommate and possible future sister in law is fully ensconced in Heathers place at the head of the ex-FOH's.<br />FOH - originally devoted to Heather, these girls now follow Tatiana like love-sick puppies.<br />Heather - no further information in this book.  Will she get over her blindness?<br />Natasha - still seems unconcerned about Tom's disappearance from the hospital.<br />Loki - stuck as a vegetable with no control of his body.  But is he starting to come out of it?<br />After 27 books it might be hard to believe that the plot could advance significantly in a single volume, but it does.  Shock is one of the keystone books of the series.  If you were wondering if you should continue with the series, you should read this book.	2003-05-15

The cat and rats can think and talk (the rats have been eating the garbage behind the wizardry school). The title characters have just arrived in a strange new town. There seems to already be a plague of rats although Maurice and company cannot find any.<br />If there are no rats, who is stealing all of the food? Where did the rat tails come from that the Rat Catchers have been turning in? What is really behind everything? Can the boy be as stupid as he looks?<br />All of these questions, and more, are answered in typical Pratchett style in this new tale of the Discworld.<br />A quick and entertaining read (with uncharacteristic chapters) that catches the reader at the start like a terrier catching a rat, and doesn't let go until it's all over (like a terrier with a rat). A must read for Pratchett fans.	2003-05-08

Four murders and a kidnaping make up the basis for this mystery set in the world of the television show Smallville.<br />The mystery was good.  Clark and friends discover that a friend and his family have been murdered.  Lionel Luthor (Lex's father) has been kidnaped.  Two good plots that are handled quite well.<br />Unfortunately, it reads like a mystery the author could not sell elsewhere so he moved the setting to Smallville.  I don't know if this is really true, but there are no real aspects of the show used in the plot.  The only advantage to the Smallville setting is that readers already know how unpleasant Lex's father really is so the author does not have to give any detail.<br />The story ends in a typical fashion with Lex curious as to how Clark managed to be on the scene and say the day yet again.<br />A good mystery but no real development of the Smallville story line.	2003-05-05

In Smallville, there is strange energy generated by green glowing meteorites.  Enter high-energy physics and you are just asking for trouble.<br />Nancy Holder tells a tale of a scientist renting a haunted house.  Unfortunately the ghosts have gained extra strength from the presence of the Smallville meteorites.<br />Clark Kent and friends get involved with the scientist daughter and try to solve the ghostly mystery.  Along the way there are disappearances, seances, cover-ups and Clark begins to lose his powers.<br />The ghosts and their haunting would be at home in any conventional horror tale.  Good spooks and some clever plot twists make it quite good.  The book's weakness is involved in adapting the ghost story to Smallville.<br />Ms. Holder has a strange idea about man-made elements and I couldn't help thinking that the imagery was taken from the movie Madame Curie.  Also, there is no real explanation as to why Clark is losing his powers or how he gets them back again.  Now, in the Superman mythos, Superman is vulnerable to magic, but that was not the case here.  Instead, it was just an unexplained plot device.<br />A good ghost story (I really enjoyed the twists), but the Smallville framing just didn't work.	2003-05-02

Based on the horror premise that when horrible things happen somewhere, there is left a trace.  In this book, the site was a house where unspeakable acts were performed by the family living there.  They were discovered and the town rose up and demolished the house.<br />Back in present day, a boy who watched the house's destruction with his friends, now owns the land and has built a new house.  But he has failed to tell his wife the history of the place or that their house has some of the original basement.<br />Well, evil things begin to happen and the wife begins to get scared.  What is going on in her house?  Evidence begins to build and we get some interesting plot twists.<br />The plot is quite good, but it suffers from being to vague at the start.  It is herd to pinpoint when things begin to build, but the do get started and the book becomes pretty interesting.<br />A good book for horror fans who like stories where evil is a force unto itself and that it can infect people.	2003-04-28

This is and is not one of them.  It uses some of the ideas from the genre but in ways that are totally new.<br />As we delve into the lives of various characters (in a Stephen King or Ray Bradbury fashion) we see occasional attacks and menacings by bees and birds.  Eventually the plot lines tie together as we find out who is on what side in the battle of good and evil.<br />This is sort of a cross between a nature goes wild story and Stephen King's The Stand.  Not a story for everyone as it does get a little weird, but a good and unpredictable tale.	2003-04-28

But no sooner does he meet with his ex than he finally meets the cute and perky Gilly (the one we have wanted him to hook up with since the start).  Triangle city.  Poor Ken is stuck in the middle of gaming, relationships, gaming, humor, gaming, life and did I mention gaming.<br />A very fun series for anyone who has ever know a compulsive personality (gamer, beanie baby collector, etc.).	2003-04-28

No, this is the story of some ordinary people (at least they think they are ordinary) who share a common hobby/lifestyle.  They like games and they, like real gamers, tend to spend a lot of money and time on them.<br />The book is a collection of strips of various lengths that center around gaming and its effects.  Anyone who has met a beanie-baby collector with be familiar with the types of personalities portrayed.<br />This volume opens with some interesting jokes about how gamers are viewed by non gamers (no true fan of anything is ever fully understood by a non-fan), and continues with high humor (extreme lack of puns despite the title) and plenty of laughs.  No topics are sacred as everything is spoofed from friendships, relationships, movies, dating, stereotypes, and fanaticism to, uh, well, games.<br />Very funny for anyone who knows that the game world is populated by more than Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers.	2003-04-25

The newest collection of the Get Fuzzy comic strip by Darby Conley.  This is a strip that stays away from the cute and cuddly nature of animal comics and goes right to the truth.<br />Get Fuzzy centers around a household containing one bachelor, a cat and a dog.  But this cat and dog are not like any others found in comic strips.  If animals could really talk, one would expect them to utter lines like those found in this book.<br />Darby manages to capture the true essence of being a pet owner that hasn't been so well since the appearance of John Arbuncle (Garfield's owner).  Using a dry wit and a sharp eye for reality, Darby spins tales that hit home for any pet owner.<br />If you have read the other collections or the daily strip, you need this one.  If you have never read the strip before but are, or know, a pet owner, then you need this one too.	2003-04-25

Many scenes seem to be grittier and more explicit than one would expect from the film and there is plenty of delving into characters' thoughts, so this won't be identical to the film.<br />The story follows two paths.<br />The first path concerns a psychotic murderer who has less than a day before his execution.  A last minute plea has been filed and the convict must be transported to the late-night hearing.<br />The second path concerns a rundown roadside motel.  A torrential rainstorm makes the motel a haven for a cast of stranded characters.  But shortly after reaching the motel, one of the characters is brutally murdered.<br />Who is the murderer?  That is the beauty of the plot.  Like in many classics, everyone can be a suspect and even the reader is kept guessing.  Soon the body count begins to rise and tempers grow short and hot.<br />A local Native American legend may supply part of the answer.  The motel is almost directly on the site of a massacre where only one Native American survived who then cursed the land.<br />The plot keeps moving and taking unexpected twists so that the reader is hooked all the way to the final resolution of the very last page.<br />This is an excellent tale of mystery/horror with shades of Agatha Christie and Sir Alfred Hitchcock.	2003-04-25

The Mayan calender has an end point (fans of The X-Files will remember the date as the day the aliens will finally invade as revealed in the series finale).  The endpoint is approaching and one man may have the key to figuring things out.<br />Our hero is a sane man who has been in a mental institution for 11 years (can he still be sane after that?)  He believes that the Mayans were right about an apocalypse happening on Dec. 21, 2012, and that date is fast approaching.  He has evidence to support his claim.<br />The book appears to have been well researched in spots and completely lacking in others.  The hero is convinced that the great temple of Kukulcan (the famous stepped pyramid at Chichen Itza in Mexico) has something inside of it.  Well, anyone who has been there knows the pyramid is hollow and has a smaller temple inside (it is part of the regular tour).  How the author missed this while tying together other well-researched history, I will never know.<br />The action escalates as alien artifacts are found and it is discovered that there is a series of alien doomsday devices set to end everything right when the Mayans said.<br />But the action is not quite enough to drag the reader through the rest of the plot and characters.  Alten's giant shark books are more fun.	2003-04-24

Something is in the water and it is vicious. It kills like a shark but is not. It's a man-shark hybrid! Now here is the really silly part, the creature has been taught how to adapt to land (it has done this before), but it has not been taught how to go back in the water (so how did it get there?).<br />So, after creating havoc in the water, the creature becomes the Saturday Night Live \\"land shark\\" and starts stalking the land. Just when you decided to never go in the water again, the sharks take to land.<br />This was a huge disappointment after Beast and the movie was even worse.

But one man suspects that something else might be happening.<br />As the search for the shark goes on, evidence begins to build and be revealed that the prehistoric predecessor to the great white is still alive and biting.<br />Shark attacks and sightings help drive the action while the truth is slowly revealed until the climax and surprise ending.<br />There was just one thing that bothered me about this book.  It was the same thing that bothered me about a TV movie about giant Salamanders attacking an island (Gargantua), all of the animals killed are the females of the pairs.  There is never any mention of the fact that mated pairs are in trouble because the females are dead.

People pay to see the incredible shark (especially at feeding time).  The lower pressures of the surface and regular feedings have allowed the shark to grow to more than 80 feet in length.  It is now the greatest living killer in the water.<br />Well, guess what?  Yup, the shark manages to escape and the hunt is on once again as Jonas Taylor must face the giant one more time.<br />But this is not just a repeat of the previous book.  No, the meg wants to return to the trench it considered home.  But there is more in the trench than we knew.  A massive research station has traveled to the bottom for purposes to be revealed.  There are also other nasty denizens from prehistory that have retreated to the trench bottom.<br />While the first book was an excellent action adventure, this on adds to that and becomes a techno thriller as the goings on at the trench bottom are revealed to the reader.<br />More, fun, more action and more giant shark.  Another great read.	2003-04-24

Sabertooth cats that have been frozen for 11,000 years are now awake, hungry, and headed for L.A.<br />Although not quite as gripping as Vespers, Rovin does an excellent job of showing the modern world as it faces one of the greatest hunters of all time.  Sabertooth cats have never been seen in cave paintings and traces of their hides have never been found.  Rovin cashes in on this lack of knowledge to design some very fearsome predators.<br />Heavy rains have created sinkholes near LA.  A local expert on primitive peoples is exploring cave paintings in a newly opened cave.  A pair of highway workers disappear near a sinkhole.  The scientist, a local reporter, and a hard-as-nails sheriff become involved as more people go missing, leaving only blood behind.<br />The terror escalates as incidents become less isolated and evidence begins to point to the unbelievable; sabertooth cats once again stalk California.<br />As the cats travel through caves and drainage systems the body count climbs.  There seems little chance of capturing the beasts and only a slightly better chance of stopping them before the kill more people.<br />The book climaxes as the main characters, the police, and national guards clash with the fearsome predators in LA.<br />This book starts fast, sets the stage and characters, and then takes off running.  The sabertooth cats make great monsters and the action pulls the reader to the final page.  The only question is, where there be a sequel?	2003-04-24

Millions of yeas ago, the giant sharks retreated to these areas and survive there today.<br />A deep sea exploration mission accidently allows one of these massive sharks to pass through the colder regions and return to surface waters.<br />Our hero, who led the expedition is now bent on stopping the shark and capturing it.  But how does one capture a hungry killing machine that is more than 60 feet long?  The answer is this book.<br />Action and suspense combine to give the reader a fast-paced adventure with a truly awesome force of nature clashing against modern man.

Each unit is capable of connecting to the others.<br />There is an interesting feature that I would like to see in other unit books.  After a particularly well-detailed unit, there was a one-page summary of the folding thus making it easier on the folder who does not memorize the unit and just needs a guide while folding the requisite number of units.<br />This is a well laid out book that does an excellent job of covering the material and achieves is goal.

Bypassing the hollow-Earth idea, Long instead imagines an incredible network of tunnels that line the entire Earth's crust.  These tunnels are inhabited by a race later known as Hadals.<br />The book begins well enough with discovery and foreshadowing.  But then it stops.  More build-ups along the way have the same result, build-up and then nothing.<br />Long seems to have a strange idea about how the world's population reacts to the discovery of such a system of tunnels; they move in.  For years!<br />Eventually we learn of a historic basis for Satan; a very-long lived Hadal.  An expedition sets out to find him.<br />The book's so-called climax ends with an attempt to exterminate the Hadals using prions (those nasty beasties responsible for such things as mad cow disease).  There is no mention, hint or anything of prions nasty habit of crossing species.  Although Long makes no mention of it, the world is doomed in his book.<br />A lot of pages full of fits and starts with no real payoff.	2003-04-23

Not as Bond-ish as the first, but way better than the second, this tale centers around Jane, youngest member of the spy-packed Spyrus (Spy-R-Us) family.  But Jane is not a field Operative.  Instead she works in development, creating the deadly and useful gadgets for the field agents.<br />But when her best friend disappears, Jane finds herself in the field armed with missile-launching vibrators, shrinking condoms and numerous other innocent-looking items as she and Abel Andretti must take on Dirk Ensecksi and plans to control the world.<br />This is a fun story with a good plot, interesting characters, gadgets galore, and a pretty good romance.  However, unlike the first novel in the series, this one misses the mark on a lot of James Bond stuff.  After all, this is supposed to be a parody of the lethal, jet-setting spy.  No code numbers here.  No casinos, exotic locations, or romantic suspense.  But it is definitely a very fun book.	2003-04-21

Unfortunately I did not get it in Dr. Yes.  There was none of the goofy gadgets, fun Bond names, or any real humor.  It started as more of a straight spy story as the heroine is enlisted by B.L.I.S.S. to go after a supposedly evil doctor bent on subjugating women.<br />With only two men in the plot, one of them the bad guy, there is no romantic or sexual tension to drive the romance plot along, what little there is of it.<br />We are never really shown that the bad guy, Dr. Archer, is really as bad as he was made out to be by B.L.I.S.S.<br />As for the romance, there really isn't any, although two characters start to get up to a little sexual shenanigans somewhere after page 200.<br />The end plot resolution was weak and there was never any real peril from the bad guy.<br />This one started like a straight spy novel, not a romance or a spoof, and then proceeded to a very weak and unfulfilling finish.<br />B.L.I.S.S. is a good series, but I think this one was just unclear on the concept.	2003-04-17

This is not a typical romance novel with some spy window dressing. No, the author seems to really understand what makes a good spy tale, and then she spoofs it beautifully.<br />Agent 36DD is our hero. She has been asigned a very important task for her first field assignment, basically save civilization as we know it. The newbie agent is backed up by a trio of partners (3 agents drawn back into active duty), a special car, and a weapon of ultimate destruction.<br />Or hero must then travel to an island designed to be a giant Monopoly board so that she can save the owner's life (Owen Sitall).<br />As the plots are revealed in tantalizing ways, the reader is drawn to the two great questions:<BR> When will she finally hook up with him? and<BR> Who is the bad guy?<br />This book delivers. The action, plotting and spoofing are handled deftly and delivered in a tantalizing package. A very fun book that makes you wish the other B.L.I.S.S. books were also written by Nina Bangs.	2003-04-10

When I first saw it, I flipped through it and saw some figures that used some rather interesting techniques.  That is why I originally bought it.<br />Upon further examination, I found myself really appreciating the look of the models taught within.  Some are really cute.<br />The diagrams are quite clear and nicely colored.  The models are at the beginner's end of the complexity spectrum, but are still very nice.  The small price tag is another nice selling point.  Too many of the good books are way to expensive for their contents but that is not the case with this book.	2003-04-08

There is an old church with a bad reputation.  It is said to be haunted.  Several generations ago the preacher was hanged by his congregation.<br />But now the church is bach in business.  The Church of the Two Suns is now there.  The idea is that G-d had two sons.  The first, Jesus, failed in his mission.  Now a second son has been sent.  This one talks of sacrifice and trials like in the Old Testament.<br />The new preacher is the great-grandson of the infamous Hung Preacher.  But is he what he says and his flock believes?  Is there any truth to the idea of the Second Son?<br />This book builds its suspense nicely with small tidbits of horror added early to help set the stage and hook the reader.  I have read a lot of horror novels but I had a hard time guessing where this one was going.  It is definately not a stock plot and the characters are very interesting.<br />If you want a horror novel that can deliver the horror but isn't like the rest, take a visit to The Red Church.	2003-04-08

This is a tale of Native American legend as fact that I had not seen this well done since Cruz's Nightwing.<br />A legendary monster it loosed from its earthly bonds thanks to an earthquake and thus the horror begins.  This book starts in tenth gear and still manages to pick up speed and the horror gets kicked up a few notches.<br />It is very rare to see a horror novel so well executed especially one that involves a monster.  But even with a monster as a plot device, Owl Goingback does not skimp on the suspense and the settings.<br />One of the best horror novels of the year (maybe THE best, but there are a few I didn't read).  If you like them creepy and scary, you have to read this one.	2003-04-08

Origami Made Easy is one of his older books but it has been constantly in print and that is rare in origami books.<br />The book is nicely organized in sections by theme and the drawings are quite clear.  The diagrams follow the standard Yoshizawa\Randlett style using just diagrams and almost no text to show how to fold figures.<br />Some of my favorite models are in this book, including my favorite peacock.<br />I have always felt it was best to learn origami by example with a teacher or tutor and not straight from a book (as I was forced to do), but for folders just getting into the art I would always recommend this book.	2003-04-08

I do not wish to give away any of the plot, but our heroes must fight \\"demons\\" from the other side who are trying to enter our world.<br />The story appears to be very well researched (except the author seems to think that glass eyes are functional and not merely cosmetic (the only real flaw in the story)). Into The Out Of was followed by Foster's Maori, after which the author seemed to leave the dark continent for good (although he did revisit horror with Vanishing Point).<br />Truely a good book.	2003-04-07

It is a fine story, but just not up to the disturbing level Laymon has made us come to expect.<br />The story centers around a tourist cave.  People flock to see the interesting rock formations, etc.  But a power outage strands a tour group at the bottom of the cave.  While the elevators do not work, and it looks like no help will be coming from that direction, the group decides to find another way out.  Bad idea.<br />Laymon likes to show how seemingly ordinary people can sink to the lowest depths when driven by circumstance or the failure of society.  Unfortunately there is very little of that in this tale.  The familiar Laymon twists and turns are also absent.  While this is one of his shortest novels, it reads more like a long short story.<br />Dark unexplored caves seem ripe for Laymon style horror to surface, but it just doesn't come through in this one.  But it is still a dark and chilling tale and one wonders what one would do in similar circumstances.	2003-04-07

As such, his books follow may different styles.  This is one that is a little more different than most.<br />At the heart of this story is a murder involving a headless body.  Thus this book is part a murder mystery while also being a gruesome and chilling look at how inhuman some human-seeming people can be.<br />If you are looking for another BEAST HOUSE, this will not fit the need, but if you are looking for a Laymon-style glimpse of evil and depravity, this is a title for you.<br />It is sometimes hard to give details about a Laymon novel without giving away something best left to the reader's discovery and this book is no exception.	2003-04-07

This book is dedicated to that idea.<br />A mysterious black rain is the catalyst that sets off a small town.  Once exposed to the black rain, ones darkest natures are able to rise to the surface and take over.<br />One Rainy Night shows us what could happen when not just one or two people throw off the shackles of civilization and succumb to the darkness, but a significant portion of the population.<br />This one kept me on edge though the whole story and I just could not figure out where it was taking me (another great trait of a Richard Laymon story).	2003-04-07

This book involves three young teens in small-town America who come across an ad for the Traveling Vampire Show.<br />Our three protagonists want to go to the show, but due to blood and nudity, the show is for adults only.  But that is not enough to stop them, instead, it seems to egg them on.<br />Most of the book takes place during the day leading up to the show.  There are also some interesting flashbacks that help flesh out the characters.<br />During the story, the reader is drawn in trying to find out more about the Traveling Vampire Show.  Is it a fraud, a real vampire (this is a horror novel after all), or something else all together?  Well, as the action and tension heat up, some questions are answered about the vampire, the show and our protagonists.<br />The small-town nature of the story has generated a lot of comparisons to Ray Bradbury and Stephen King but I feel it is not really either.  It stands on its own.<br />An absolutely wonderful book that gras hold and drags you right to the final page.	2003-04-07

Some local teens have decided that the homeless have got to go.  These youths thrill at the chase and torture of the homeless.  But any operation like this, no matter how well-intentioned, will escalate.<br />Local police and a new kid in town get involved and it soon becomes apparent that not all is as it seems.  It seems that the homeless may be preying on their attackers and there is definitely something not right about the amusement park.<br />Another wonderful send up from one of the greatest of all horror writers.	2003-04-07

Another great and disturbing tale from one of the greatest horror writers of all time.  Laymon's imagination is truly twisted.<br />Lonesome is the story of a college student who goes out one night and obsesses about a girl he sees.  It sounds simple, but you have to remember that this is Laymon writing the story so there is nothing simple about it.<br />What hides in the dark of night?  What will people do when there is no sun shining?  What really goes on in the darkness?  Are you really alone when you hear noises at night?  These are just some of the questions addressed by this book.<br />Our hero manages to get completely drawn into some of the strangest predicaments imaginable.  The one plot twist I though I had figured out never happened (and I'm glad as it shows Laymon anticipated the suspicion).<br />After reading this book you will be very wary of going out at night into familiar areas and you will completely avoid the unfamiliar.  This one is just believable enough to be really scary.	2003-04-07

This time we see a family struggle after a devastating earthquake disrupts the entire city.<br />As with any disaster, looters and worse rear their ugly heads.  But central to the fear is lonely Stanley, a former peeper who now has an opening to actually pursue his desires.  After all, in the madness following the quake, who will notice some premeditated violence.  His goal is the family's daughter and his drive is relentless.  He knows that once the city has recovered, he will have lost his chance to pursue his perverse fantasies.<br />Laymon once again shows us the dark heart of people when civilizations restraints have been removed.  A fine read.	2003-04-07

Our narrator relates the tale of a summer when things were not so good for him and his friend Arnie.  Unfortunately, the narrator opens with the phrase \\"at least Arnie didn't die!\\"  He uses it more than once.  The trouble is that Arnie DID die!  I guess an author can forget what they wrote 450 pages earlier.<br />Christine is a ghost story.  This time the ghost centers around an old can and not a house or cemetery.  The suspense builds nicely, but as I read the novel in one sitting, the \\"Arnie didn't die\\" mistake really ruined the book for me.<br />For those who have seen the movie, do not expect that Hollywood was faithful, the movie and book are two very different stories (although I felt Hollywood did a better job of convincing me the car was bad).<br />Christine was King's next book after Different Seasons, so it had a much different feel and was closer to The Shining than to Different Seasons.  I am sure that many will really enjoy the book, but when an author forgets his basic theme, I can not say it is good.	2003-04-07

This is another attempt by Laymon to show how dark some people can become.<br />The story opens with a maniac looking for a new victim.  But the maniac is quickly toasted, but not before a disgusting worm leaves his body to infest another.  People infested with the work turn violent and shed all pretense of being civilized.<br />Typical Laymon suspense and horror spiced with the reality of just how does one go about stopping this worm.<br />Laymon again shows us that he can craft characters who act as people should.  In this book, it takes time for people to see the signs of the worm and deduce that something else might be behind the violence.<br />A terrifying read that will really make your flesh crawl.	2003-04-07

Fans of John Montroll's other books will know that he tends to follow a fixed set of ideas.  These are that the paper should be square and that only one sheet should be used.  Outside of a few basic shapes (cubes and pyramids mostly), the use of a single sheet in creating polyhedra is not very widespread.  Montroll uses this book to show up that it needs not be the case.<br />Montroll shows how a single sheet of paper can be folded into more complex polyhedra including skeletal forms.<br />These models all follow a basic pattern of precreasing the paper to isolate the polyhedron's sides, and then collapsing the paper into the 3D model.  Very interesting techniques, and Montroll seems to get the largest possible solid from the paper, but the single-sheet design does lose something in solidity.  Many multi-piece models are very strong, but that is not the case here.  However, if you like geometrics but could not bring yourself to fold 30 to 180 pieces of paper for a single model, you will love this book.	2003-04-04

Fans have been known to say that these models do not seem quite as realistic as many of his others.  But they have missed the point.<br />As the title suggests, this is inside-out origami.  In other words, both sides of the paper are visible in the final model.  This allows for a different level of detail (such as an actual chessboard).<br />Like Montroll's other books, all models are made from a single sheet of square paper.  However, these models really look best if the two sides of the paper are not the same color.<br />A fun and fascinating addition to any origami library.	2003-04-04

Sometimes another author will take up some of the ideas.  Sometimes that is a good author like Simon Clark.<br />One night the Earth is plunged into darkness and triffids can once again get the upper hand on humanity.<br />Our hero, son of the previous hero, immediately finds himself in the middle of things twenty-five years after the original tale.<br />After crashing a plane while trying to discover the extent of the darkness, he discovers floating mats of vegetation that can transport triffids to island communities, some people are immune to triffid poison, there are some major settlements in the Americas (including Manhattan), triffids are adapting to changing environments, and all is not as it seems.<br />He is rescued and taken to Manhattan where tens of thousands of people live in pre-blindness splendor.  The Manhattan power structure is very interested in some of the developments from our hero's colony.  He quickly becomes a pawn in some major power plays that could have serious repercussions for his home community.<br />A very wonderful extension of the triffid story.  My only problem was the appearance of the giant triffids.  While there size is not out of the scope of plants, I felt they should have suffered some in the mobility department.<br />Much longer than the original, this tale is full of action, discovery, human interest and hope for humanity.

When books are based on screenplays, you have to try and figure out what of the book is original to the author and what originates in the screenplay.  This book is no different.<br />Imagine the movie Armageddon, but with the heroes traveling in the opposite direction.  Like in Armageddon, a series of sudden events leads to the discovery that the world is about to be destroyed.  A team is assembled, trained, and launched into the interior of the planet carrying a massive nuclear payload (1000 megatons).<br />There are perils along the way and the action moves at a very quick pace.  Definitely fun.<br />Also like Armageddon, most of accepted physics is thrown out the window (and some really stupid designs in the ship).<br />All of this is very nicely captured and retold by Mr. Smith.  Action movies appeal to a different set of brain cells than novels, but Smith does a very good job of getting the feeling of the movie across in book form.<br />This is a very good adaptation of a silly action movie (it is also cheaper than an average theater ticket and will last most readers more than two hours).<br />Not to be confused with Deepcore, the boring film Terry Farrell left Deep Space Nine for.	2003-04-02

These are rather contived tales about a telepathic Shipscat.  They sort of remind me of bad SF mysteries; you know the type where some unexplained device is pulled out at the last minute to save the day.<br />Some of the other stories have also shown up in other collections.<br />Diana Tregarde fans will enjoy a cute story as DT attends a romance-writer's convention.<br />The final two stories are &quot;Grey&quot; stories.  The first was written for a birdkeeping magazine, but neither is really about birds.  The author describes them as sort of a Victorian-age Diana Tregarde series.<br />Overall not a bad collection, but a little less diverse than FIDDLERS FAIR.

All copies I have seen end at 300 and it really feels like there is something missing.<br />Brothers who have made a name for themselves making cheap, grade-B horror films have a new project: a reality-show where contestants have to spend the night in a haunted house.<br />Being a horror novel, the house is, of course, haunted by some real nasties. Jody, a farm girl looking to improve her luck, is the contestant we are rooting for.<br />Unfortunately, after a slow beginning (setting the stage), and a little foreshadowing, the plot and body count speed up and then the book just stops. End. Finis. Nothing more. Even if there is a publication mistake and there are fifty missing pages, it is hard to see how this one would be saved.<br />There are some interesting scenes and the manifestation has an interesting twist, but it just isn't really worth the time.	2003-04-01

A changeling is a person switched at birth (tradionally by elves), not a shapechanger.<br />A virulent genetic plague is the catalyst for a tale of a world first decimated by and later evolved by genetic tampering.<br />Like many action films, the story moves fast and furious with a very interesting cast of characters (yay, Mr. Yi!), but don't pay too much attention to the details as they are quite contradictory.<br />In a world where people are to frightened to leave their homes and industry grinds to a halt, you can still get pizza delivery (even in remote locations), there is no shortage of food, even auction houses stay open to sell their Chippendale chairs.<br />If you don't like inconsistency, avoid this one like the plague.  But if you are looking for a fast entertaining read and details don't derail your fun, give this one a try.	2003-02-27

Interesting backfround used to make the &quot;monster&quot; believable, but there was no real tension.  There was obviously a good deal of research done for this book.<BR>While not a page-turner, it was a very interesting book if you like WWII, history, monsters or combinations thereof.<BR>It was a good read, but nothing to write home about.	2003-02-24
1219414:US	38672733	R1GC4JANML14DC	1893121186	38561737	Chicago's Midway Airport: The First Seventy-Five Years (Illinois)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	The Unbelievable Birth of Aviation	An airport owned by a school system?  Planes that have to wait for trains to pass?  A Hindenburg-like crash that occured in the center of the city?  Hundreds of fascinating photos draw the reader in and the unbelievable history unfolds in the text using sidebars, oral histories, and painstakingly researched facts.  A one-of-a-kind read that was well worth the wait.	2003-02-21
1219505:US	38672733	R1J5AT79NWUL8K	0743434757	605873165	The Alien Factor	Books	1	1	2	N	N	"Logan's Losers" lose it	This is not a bad book, but is not the book it claims to be.  Lee combines two favorite ideas in a story of alien contact during WWII.  But the alien is really just a McGuffin, and the reader is treated to a tale of Allies, Nazis, Communists, spies and resistance all trying to outfox one another and protect their own ideas.  The alien could easily be replaced with a munitions dump, secret weapon, or other typical WWII target without changing the story very much.  Good war story but a lousy alien tale.	2003-02-21

Although not as fascinating as his PAPER CRYSTALS (a stellar work of modular origami), MATHEMATICAL ORIGAMI is a very solid work on the topic.  David Mitchell again gives clear instructions in text and diagrams for a very intriguing branch of paperfolding.  There are many books on geometric and modular origami, but Mitchell's are more than just \\"look at this neat design.\\"  Instead, they are well thought out and very intelligently written.  A must-have for fans of the art.	2003-02-21
