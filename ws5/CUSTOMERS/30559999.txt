James Blackwood is one of those people who served as a role model by the way he treated others, conducted himself professionally, and pioneered an artform and ministry. Dr. Allen Dennis is to be commended for collecting this tribute. The thing that stood out for me was the character factor, i.e., that several contributors mentioned how Blackwood was a polished professional who took his work seriously, yet he was approachable and truly interested in other people.<br /><br />Like several others said in their comments in the book, James Blackwood was one of my heroes when I was growing up. Professor Dennis edited this book in such a way that the comments pertaining to Blackwood relate to much more than just him. They demonstrate how others can leave a similar legacy in their own arenas. It's a matter of dedication and discipline. Repeatedly, Blackwood is described as a Christian gentleman and a genuine professional at his craft. I suggest the same could be said for Allen Dennis who left this work as part of his legacy.	2005-10-13

He talks about the present as always changing into the past and the future. In other words, the present isn't really present. To illustrate how change occurs he mentions a piece of meat as it is cooking. If left unattended, when will the meat cease to be meat?<br /><br />In places he gets bogged down in jargon and complexity. He starts by discussing education in general, noting that in addition to English, a student should study French and Latin, that certain things can only be known though the original tongue of the author. Overall this is an insightful collection of essays.	2005-10-10

Seven Hebrew words categorize the different types of praise: Yadah, Towdah, Halal, Shabach, Barak, Zamar, and Telillah. Trombly goes on to describe what each of them means.<br /><br />Take \\"towdah,\\" for example. It mixes faith with praise because it is used to thank God in advance for things that have not yet been manifested. Towdah is a \\"sacrifice of praise.\\" On the subject of faith, Trombley notes, \\"Everything is received by faith whether salvation, deliverance, prosperity, or the promise of the Holy Spirit. All are appropriated by faith.\\"<br /><br />Some encouragement is given to overcomers when he reminds us that challenges aren't meant to overwhelm us, but to present opporunities to win. He quotes Kenneth Hagin, Sr. as saying, \\"I play until I win\\" (in the game of life).	2005-10-03

That's because God is the Creator and He knows what is best. His ways are perfect regardless of what circumstances seem to imdicate. Coupling experience with research, the author discusses why some counseling works, while other efforts fall short. He addresses people who have sought help through counselors, only to find themselves disappointed.<br /><br />In this section of the book he points out that any valid counsel must be based on what God's Word, the Bible says about an issue. The Bible does not speak to every issue, but it provides principles that apply.<br /><br />He makes a solid case that not all counselors who say they are Christian truly are. What he says on this issue follows logically. Going on from these general issues, in the latter part of the book he gets into specific problems people seeking help would most likely face. His advice is solid and helpful. This is a good book for those seeking help and realizing hope is truly available, but it may take some time to achieve the desired results.	2005-09-26

In fact following every few paragraphs there is a section of reflective questions that summarizes the key points and help you to put them into a context for your own life.<br /><br />Blackaby and King describe personal experiences, but subordinate those to the Scripture. Some favorite examples from the Bible are used repeatedly in the various chapters. Model prayers are included at the end of each chapter to assist a person in praying targeted prayers.<br /><br />If a general theme could be drawn out from the book it would be: a relationship to God is more important than any work you do for Him. That's the essence of the book. The authors say as God reveals to you what He is doing, He invites you to join Him in His work. Consequently, listening in prayer is more important that speaking, according to this premise.	2005-09-11

DeVries tells us in the foreward that Sanders' motivation for writing this book was that as he neared the end of his life, he was researching his future destination. In so doing he brought passion to the work, supplemented by the skills of a scholar. There are various types of books on heaven, some very subjective in their approach, others from a more analytical view. This book presents a look at the evidence, but with zeal and enthusiasm.<br /><br />He has done a commendable job of reviewing the literature of what other scholars have said on the subject and adds his own research to what he has found. He even presents varying viewpoints on different issues before saying where he stands and why.<br /><br />The vast majority of this book is excellent. Toward the end I find a weakness. He interprets certain passages in the Bible as symbolic which I see as literal. I think he is just wrong. Other sections of the book, however are quite good.	2005-08-16

He uses humor to make a serious point throughout the book. For any Christian who has read motivational books from the perspective of the Bible, these \\"secrets\\" are already known, but a gifted communicator like Pastor Hagee keeps it interesting.	2005-08-09

Baxter gives God all the glory, accurately cites Scripture, has a humble attitude, and tells people the only way to heaven is through Jesus. I believe she's telling the truth. This testimony of what she experienced encourages you to \\"lay up treasures in heaven.\\" That isn't materialistic. That's what Jesus taught.<br /><br />Reviewers who say she contradicts Scriptures offer no evidence. I saw no such thing in this book. On the issue of babies (beginning at concepetion) going to heaven, I suggest Dr. John MacArthur's book. He answers those questions using the Bible as his source.<br /><br />Any book that does not contradict the Bible, that encourages you to do God's work, and points the way to Jesus is one worth considering. This book takes the focus off \\"this life\\" and puts it on things of eternal value.	2005-08-04

Truth is truth. Truth is found in what the Bible says about an issue. MacArthur poses the question, how do you know children, regardless of their stage of development, go to heaven? On what basis do you respond? Does the Bible address the issue of babies going to heaven?<br /><br />There is comfort in that the answers on these matters are in the affirmative. In a scholarly study of the subject, Dr. MacArthur provides answers from God's Word. The author comes across as more than a world class Bible scholar, which he is. Some of the contributions come from people he's pastored. He's lived through these heart-wrenching experiences with these precious people. This is a comforting book for anyone who has had a loved one recently depart this life, particularly parents of small children.	2005-07-26

He emphasizes the necessity of making changes happen rather than waste energy merely discussing it.<br /><br />Cook is openly Christian in the philosophy he uses. He quotes the Bible throughout this book and tells how his overriding objective is to someday hear God say \\"well done good and faithful servant.\\" Money is not the ultimate objective, it's a tool for enhancing the quality of life for himself, his family, and other people.<br /><br />While communication is not as important as action, there is a place for it. Cook doesn't neglect its importance, but puts it in proper context as he develops his theme. I highly recommend this book if you want to be stimulated to improving the quality of your achievements.	2005-07-25

It is holistic in helping you to see the necessity of balancing all the myriad aspects which overlap and compete for resources. One particularly helpful feature is the series of questions he has about one's past, present, and future.<br /><br />A substantial part of the book deals with perception. How one interprets circumstances is vital to achieving goals. Another topic addressed in depth is balancing money and relationships. On the issue of financial stewardship he includes both saving and giving. In a similar way, he discusses how maturity includes a holistic and comprehensive approach to handling long term financial considerations, including preparing for loved ones after one's death. My own parents are excellent role models for this, just as his, based on what he says in this book. Along those lines, I want to have the goals similar to what he implies for himself. I want to leave a complete legacy for my children, including financial, spiritual, and social.	2005-07-16

Baker, an American missionary to China. Prior to being in China, he served in Tibet from 1911 to 1919. Here he records the experiences of young children who were residents of the Adullam Rescue Mission in Yunnanfu, Yunnan Province, China.<br /><br />Before describing what the children saw while under the influence of the Holy Spirit, the author establishes the Scriptural basis for such visions. He cites numerous incidents from the Bible that the sort of things the children saw \\"in the Spirit\\" were experienced by people in the Bible and that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever.<br /><br />This book, as edited by Baker's associate, T. A. Lanes, is encouraging in pointing to the reality of what Christians can expect when God calls them home. The concluding chapter is solid in explaining that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life and He is the ONLY WAY to heaven.	2005-07-14

In the conclusion he evens admits he hasn't totally implemented all he writes about in his own life. He explains that if a reader can accomplish 25% of what he describes, significant financial progress will result. There is not any major revelations in this book. He reminds you of the basics.<br /><br />He puts finances into context, emphasizing from the outset that other aspects of life have to be taken into consideration. One of the recurring themes is to give to worthy causes. He also talks about tithing. His discussion on money always being in circulation is worthwhile.<br /><br />The reflective nature of this book takes the subject matter way beyond greed. Stewardship, not accumulation is the framework. These principles are worthy goals which should be achieved by anyone interested in being a responsible adult.	2005-07-06

There isn't any new revelation in this book. She shares her personal insights and largely cites the Scriptures that talk about what is awaiting the dead in Christ.<br /><br />One of the other reviewers was correct to point out that this small book contains extensive poetic type lists. The plan of salvation is given near the end so people who are unsure how to make heaven their destination can do so.<br /><br />Her description of heaven is one involving preperation that is personal. She writes...\\"God...knows the colors I love, the scenery I enjoy, the things that make me happy, all the personal details that will let me know when I walk into My Father's House, I am expected and welcome, because He has prepared it for me! And in the same way, He is preparing a glorious homecoming for you!\\"<br /><br />This book is a comforting read if you have lost a loved one or if you are seeking encouragement and reassurance.	2005-07-01

At a couple of places in the book he says that initially he thought the experience was too intimate to share, but over time he realized part of his reason for returning to earth was to share what happened to him. Because of the painful recovery process, he said he had to secure a professional writer (Cecil Murphey) to do the actual writing because it was just too emotionally troubling to try to write it himself.<br /><br />The strongest part of the book is the beginning because that's when he shares what he saw in heaven. There's also a strong ending, it's the in-between part that becomes pedantic as he describes his rehabilitation process. It's part of the story and is included for the purposes of completeness.<br /><br />In the final chapter he gets philosophical, asking the \\"why\\" questions, but being unable to come up with an adequate answer. Some of what happened to him is mysterious to him as well, but in other areas he sees how he's been able to help other people.	2005-06-29

Even the title implies that the unknown will be revealed. Disappointingly the mystery isn't answered. The conclusion can be summed up as \\"Trust God even when you don't understand.\\"<br /><br />Joni Eareckson Tada, one of this generation's master communicators gave such a powerful buildup in the foreward I was really anticipating an insightful epiphany. There are some good quotes and teachings, but no major revelations are found.<br /><br />This book uses the raising of Lazarus from the dead as its primary teaching point. If you've lost a loved one and seek answers in this book, it only leads to the obviously question of why wasn't my loved one raised?<br /><br />For other issues, there is some insight and comfort. The author, of course, means well and is tackling a very tender, difficult subject. The book is solidly scriptural. It contains some good teaching, but it doesn't particularly help anyone going through the grief of a recently departed loved one.	2005-06-28

The plot is not resolved until the final page. L'Amour writes authentically because he lived the lives of the characters he created. Yes he lived a few generations after the Western Frontier days, but as much as reasonably possible, he put himself into the locations and mindset of those living in the Ole West.<br /><br />L'Amour ties in a subtle romantic theme that sees positive resolution in the conclusion of \\"Chancy.\\" The protagonist is motivated by wanting to do something significant with his life. He isn't greedy or selfish. Chancy sees himself as an outsider and one of his sidekicks is an Indian who views himself in the same way. Kindred spirits are drawn together for a common purpose. My only real complaint is that all the conflict resolutions are made through violence. The strongest always win. That's just too unrealistic, simplistic, and sad. Otherwise, this is a good escape read.	2005-06-24

The theme of this book is the Golden Rule Jesus taught, \\"Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you.\\"<br /><br />Petersen saw the need for this approach to management because he was treated with such disrespect in one of the units where he was placed early in his career. His epiphany was that this work unit was operating in a way that caused misery at work, and mediocre output. He realized that relationships among people in an organization are vital for success. Edwards Deming was brought in as Petersen worked his way up the corporation. Deming's strategies included measurement techniques to gange corporate success. Employees across the board realized that their input mattered, and things changed for the better. Petersen is a good man speaking well. He makes a lot of valid points in this book.	2005-06-24

Professor Orlik has brought together a wealth of sources from myriad backgrounds covering everything from one-person advertising agencies to executives with mega-media giants.<br /><br />In the concluding chapter, ten experts in the field offer ten tips for breaking into the field. That's 100 in total and the convincing thing about it is that several of these experts offer the same advice. Have a passion for the work and never give up is the sum of what they advise.<br /><br />Electronic media is a field that is changing even more rapidly than a lot of other segments of society. Professor Orlik describes those changes in detail throughout this book. Another common thread that runs through every section is ethical responsibility. For broadcasters to be true professionals, ethics must be uppermost in the minds of decision-makers doing their daily tasks.<br /><br />Professor Orlik is a master communicator himself. Several of the contributors talk about the role of media personnel being that of the storyteller. In this career guidance book, Orlik tells a pretty inspiring story himself, one of passion for a worthwhile life contribution. This book will fuel your passion for the field and point you in the right direction to network, build a resume tape, and gain experience while enjoying the process.	2005-05-31

This is one of the best. Professor Fujishin exudes the passion he talks about in the final two chapters of this book. He is passionate about the topic, the audience (in this case his readers), and he has a healthy self-esteem. All three are necessary for connecting with an audience in a meaningful way, he explains.<br /><br />The author stresses ethics throughout the whole book. It is filled with inspiring quotes. His points are illustrated by anecdotes and personal insights from himself and people he's known.<br /><br />I get the impression that he is truly a nice guy.<br /><br />That comes across in his writing. It's like I know him after reading his book. He touched me to that extend.<br /><br />Now, having said all those positive things, I do have a couple of ideas for improvement. First his citations are weak. In the text he identifies such well known poeple as Abraham<br /><br />Maslow and Alan Monroe, but in most places he talks about \\"a study.\\" Curious readers want to know \\"which study.\\" How about a bibliography at the end of each chapter? Another odd thing I found was the fact that he seems to be a Christian who is afraid to mention the Name of Jesus. Why do I get that impression? He cites names of leaders of all kinds of other religions. He even quotes the Bible and talks several times about preachers and church, but there's never a mention of the Name. Just an interesting observation I picked up on.<br /><br />Overall this is a great book. It emphasizes the importance of relationships. Communication is about being \\"other centered\\" and the author is a master at following the advice he's advocating.	2005-05-18

I did those things myself when I was getting started.<br /><br />This book covers the news gathering process as well as writing. They add an ethics dimension in every part of the book.

There are positive and negative aspects of this era in American history which saw the nation moving toward a better standard of living for the masses. Henry Ford comes out appearing very human. By that I mean he had some extremely admirable qualities, but at the same time he made some major mistakes that had lifelong negative consequences for his family.<br /><br />Thankfully Sorensen kept a diary so the material he draws upon in this book was not skewed by trying to recall events after they had long passed. He saw Henry Ford as a man for whom a sense of responsibility was one of his strongest traits. He also said Ford never appeared to be afraid of anything. Sorensen said Ford's philosophy was, \\"We must go ahead without the facts; we will learn them as we go along.\\"<br /><br />Ford is described as a man who sought action, not theory. He wanted results and kept his executives free from unneccesary paperwork. Sorensen and Ford were so absorbed in their work that they worked in their \\"free time\\" to accomplish their goals. Work was play for them and the passion for the task showed.<br /><br />The war years presented new challenges for Sorensen. He provides details of how he and others did the impossible in producing air craft for the nation. He and others of his ilk seemed to thrive on challenge. They were doers throughout their whole lives.<br /><br />Henry Ford's biggest failure seemed to be his relationship to his son Edsel. Henry couldn't accept that fact that his son was not a duplication of himself. He never showed his son respect. Edsel appeared to be trapped in the shadow of his internationally famous dad. Ford company executives resented Edsel. He experienced physical sickness related to stress. But Sorensen says of Edsel Ford, that he \\"was a gentleman in the finest, fullest meaning of the word.\\" He describe how he always presented himself in a kind and professional manner.<br /><br />This book gives you a first hand account of an insider's view of an achiever.

There's a difference between superstituion and spiritual reality. To ignore that unexplainable \\"miracles\\" occur is to be so devoted to a lie that you refuse to see the truth. Lewis extends his exploration on this topic to speculations that other writers would not touch. For example, secularists insist that Christians are so \\"straight laced\\" that they percieve heaven as a place where we float on clouds and play harps. Yawn! They haven't read this book. C. S. Lewis speculates that if sex is about the ultimate enjoyment in this \\"natural\\" life, the joys of heaven will be so much more intense that sex will seem dull by comparison. I might add Billy Graham has made similar inferences in his writings.<br /><br />Periodically Christians will talk about God not being limited to time or space. Lewis elabortes on that by talking about God even being able to answer prayers \\"out of sequence\\" so to speak. He talks about the possibility of a prayer uttered at noon being answered at 10 am. God operates in an eternal \\"now\\" as Oral Roberts has been known to put it.<br /><br />In summary, this book sheds light on the awesome nature of God. We were created for His pleasure. He is not restrained by anything He made. Miracles go beyond the limits we normally experience. This is a faith building book that helps you to see beyond the familiar.	2005-05-13

Generally what you'll find is a broad overview of the topic of management/stewardship. Everyone is a manager in that we all have resources that have been given to us by God for which we're responsible. Scripturally the author approaches things from principles solidly backed up by the Bible.<br /><br />This book causes you to think more about the spiritual dimension involved in the process of being an effective steward over resources. In places there's a fresh, insightful perspective. In other places the discussion is less rigorous and somewhat simplistic. There's a niche for that sort of coverage so that's not to say it is a negative. It's simply a description of the way the subject is handled in this book.	2005-05-10

Watchman Nee makes a qualifying statement in the introduction on symbolism. He describes the use of figures of speech in all works, including the Bible. It is this feature which makes for different interpretations of a book like the Song. Other Bible teachers have interpreted this book in a totally different way, seeing the Shulamite turning down Solomon's advances and the \\"he\\" in the various passages being someone else. When pronouns such as \\"he\\" are not directly connected to an identifying source of origin, it's easy to see how there can be different interpretations.<br /><br />Another example of this can be found in the phrase about \\"the lily of the valley,\\" which most people use to refer to the Lord Jesus. Nee interprets that as the Shulamite, i.e., that she is just a common lily among many others.<br /><br />Having said all that, Nee's study is still benefical. You can tell he is thoroughly Bible literate as he constantly uses the Bible to interpret the Song. He traces various symbols back to other passages. The insights he brings in this study remain valid because the general theme is built on orthodoxy. He isn't advancing any \\"new gospel\\" but deepening an understanding of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.	2005-05-07

This is a thorough study of the mystery of God's providence. Dr. Carson left a work that earns the status of \\"Christian Classic\\" in that this book adds greatly to our understanding of the ways of God. He reminds us, \\"God rules as absolutely on earth as he does in heaven. Nothing takes place but what he has ordained for his own glory, and for the good of his own people. Believers are in the world in the midst of their enemies, who have all earthly power in their hands, yet the Lord perserves them uninjured in every instance in which it is not for his own glory and their good that they should suffer.\\"<br /><br />Abraham is used to illustrate how God is involved in both \\"time\\" and \\"place\\" in the life of a believer. \\"A day sooner, or a day later, would not have answered the purpose,\\" Dr. Carson writes. He adds, \\"...at this moment, at this very spot where it is needed.\\"<br /><br />Consider his reflection on how providence is planned as God guides individuals to the mate of His choice for them: \\"How many things, apparently accidental, are necessary to open a way to the acquaintance of those who are afterwards to be married to each other! Husbands and wives may be born for each other, as much as Eve was formed for Adam, while their marriage depends on the most trifling accident.\\" He describes how what appears to be natural to us in the physical arena, is designed by God mysteriously in the spiritual dimension.<br /><br />This book is particularly inspirational. He teaches directly from the Bible and shows how the principles of God's guidance unfold in our lives today. You'll come away from this realization with a renewed sense of humble thankfulness for God's care.	2005-05-06

This book is thorough in covering the material. The opening chapters include background on the history of broadcasting itself, while later sections focus more on the theme of the book, sports broadcasting. It concludes with profiles of successful sports journalists who created the paradigm in place today, and the very last chapter takes a look at the future through the eyes of the commissioners of the professional sports leagues.<br /><br />Schultz's writing style is easy to follow. In fact, he practices what he advocates, i.e., basic writing skills come from effective readers. You can tell from his work that he is well-read. He includes the international, national, and local career options in his discussion. Historically he lists what he considers to be milestones in the development of the profession in the United States. I highly recommend this book. It is well-researched and comprehensive.	2005-05-05

It's common to view the process of success as a means to a goal, but Steve Arterburn views it as success itself. The lifestyle of accomplishment defines the achiever. The author has the credentials as he's candid with his readers that he's failed and struggled over the years before having something to show for his efforts.<br /><br />Writers that discuss passion in an authentic way motivate me. Arterburn is such a writer. Arterburn is a Christian who notes that true passion comes from discovery God's plan for your life. This is how he discusses a God-given dream: \\"The word 'inspiration comes from a Latin word meaning 'to blow' or 'breathe upon.' I love this word picture because I can just see the Spirit of God 'blowing' an idea into my brain. I truly believe that many, if not most, of the best ideas in my life have been God-breathed.\\"<br /><br />You're encouraged to pursue God and His plan for your life. Fulfillment comes from living the life He created you to live. This is a book for dreamers in the most positive sense of that term.	2005-04-26

He had to work hard and overcome numerous obstacles before reaching the top of his profession. The principles that led to success in his arena apply in all areas of live as he points out so clearly in this excellent book (with Robert Wolgemuth).<br /><br />One theme is to focus on what you can control and don't expend energy on the rest. He emphasizes how important the preparation process is because it's all about focus. That is what one can control. If one continually prepares, success is inevitable. He talks about building a mind-set where everyday counted. Excellence mattered to him. He wasn't trying to please his coaches, he was seeking excellence for its own reward.<br /><br />As a Christian he talks about how he came to know the Lord Jesus. I bought the book because I knew he was a Bowling Green man. It turns out he's a class act all the way around. His advice is solid.	2005-04-26

Encouragement comes about from reading how other people have successfully faced their challenges and with God's help overcome them. In his collection, Dr. Peale provides such examples. His material is always relevant as the principles he teaches are timeless.<br /><br />Take the story of Dwight D. Eisenhower. He says his mother was the most influential person in his life and one of the things she taught him that stayed with him was to take the had you're dealt in life and work with it. By doing that things will turn out right. I see people who have come completely unglued because things didn't go their way. They used their energy up fussing over matters that would not change.

This author projects his value system into people living in Jacobean England. He assumes his motives were shared by them. He's clearly a materialist writing about a spiritual subject and that is a major limitation of this book.<br /><br />On the positive side, he is to be commended for addressing the subject and digging into the archives to provide 21st century readers with a background of the Translators of the KJV of the Bible and the process involved. Factually, he's done his work. However, the negative cannot be ignored. his interpretations of people's motives is way off base. He assumes a lot that simply cannot be verified. The editorializing is offensive.<br /><br />He concentrates his efforts on sytle rather than content. Many pages are devoted to comparing the word choice of the Translators to the work of Shakespeare. The main point was to make the Word of God available to English speaking people on a wide scale basis. Reading this book you would not realize that. He infers it was some kind of plot by King James to unify his kingdom. Again, Nicolson is \\"reading\\" something into history based on his own imagination. Read this book critically. Do not accept the opinions in it.	2005-04-14

How do perceptions influence social interactions? These are the kinds of reflective questions this book causes you to think about.<br /><br />Set in 16th century France, this case of mistaken identity, where one person assumes the identity of another, is intentionally ambiguous in drawing the reader in to make some personal judgments independent of the author. This masterful technique requires an active reader.<br /><br />Chapter 10 describes one of the judges in the case after it was appealed. He went on to write a book on the matter. Jean de Coras was a Christian scholar, a writer, lawyer, romantic, and communicator. Fortunately for us the author included this excerpt on him, as he was a character who made a mark that has survived over time.<br /><br />Overall this is a book that will make you consider yourself and how you treat other people. It's a healthy form of reflection that is designed to help you consider things you might otherwise overlook.	2005-04-06

In considering these key leaders, he goes on to describe how they influenced the general population to buy into their ideology.<br /><br />There were points of internal conflict within the organization. The Nazi Party was not a unified whole. Like any human social structure there were different ideas about what should be done and how matters should be approached.<br /><br />Generally, the public is shown to be apathetic. There wasn't much feeling one way or the other to the average citizen in Northeim. Chronologically, Allen goes on to describe what took place in the town after WWII.	2005-04-01

In the appendix and concluding section a broader context explains how things changed as quickly as twenty-five years after the body of the book was written.<br /><br />Hives describes how he narrowly escaped with his life on various expeditions. In recounting what he saw, it's obvious to see that human life did not hold much value in this setting. Children were routinely fed to crocodiles (as part of the Ju Ju superstituion). Men had numerous wives. Slavery was acceptable. Other atrocities could be added to the list.<br /><br />Hives points out that Christian churches filled the landscape in the subsequent 25 year period.

A major part of his ministry was one-on-one. A humble man who desired to have Jesus exalted, he shared the Gospel wherever he went. In the preface we're told about 20 people were reportedly raised from the dead as a result of his prayers.<br /><br />I'll just provide a few glimpses of his insight to give you a small taste:<br /><br />\\"We need to rest and always trust the plan of God.\\"<br /><br />\\"The more there was no hope, Abraham believed in hope.\\"<br /><br />\\"I tell you, God can arrange everything.

In fact, she's honest enough to point out certain areas that are still challenging to her. Knowing the principles is the beginning, applying them is where the peace activation kicks in.<br /><br />She begins this study with the issue of being able to recognize what you can change and what you cannot change and acting on that discernment. Some of the very practical matters she discusses is that you have to take care of yourself if you're going to get along with other people. That includes something as basic as rest.<br /><br />I found her discussion on knowledge not being all its cracked up to be to really hit the spot. She pointed out that in some situations it's just better not to know certain things, for example if someone is saying something negative about you, it's better just to not know.<br /><br />Her husband Dave comes across in this book as a true saint,both in the literal and cliche sense. She points out that in the early years of their marriage when she was struggling with these things, Dave gave the best sermons possible, those lived in the crucible of the real world.	2005-03-27

In essence that captures the theme of this well-written work. At the heart of leadership is the desire to serve other people. Practical matters such as focusing on results and living a disciplined life are included under this umbrella.<br /><br />Self image is vital to giving out to others, as he reminds us, \\"No one can live on a level inconsistent with the way he sees himself.\\" Therefore, it's necessary to take care of one's own needs before one can help other people.<br /><br />Cultivating relationships is essential to leaders. In fact, logically speaking a leader who delegates cannot accomplish anything apart from others. So while being results oriented, Maxwell does not neglect the relational aspect of success.<br /><br />Being a dreamer, I love what he expresses about turning the dream into reality in spite of the opinions of others. His advice is, \\"Never allow others to put obstacles in the pathway to your dreams.\\"<br /><br />This is such an inspiring book! I strongly recommend it. I've read several of this works. I've never been disappointed. He always has a valid, practical, Christian lesson to impart. The consequences of the ideas expressed in this book are the kind that make things better.	2005-03-25

His \\"predictions\\" for the future were not exactly on target. Remember this was written in 1989. What caused me to go with 4 stars was the sections that are relevant beyond the date of original publication for the most part, although I don't always agree with him on those issues either.<br /><br />One of the strongest arguments he makes is in his chapter, \\"the litigious society,\\" where he cites statistics that backup his case that the legal profession is hindering productivity in this nation as a whole. Lawyers have to generate business to continue to exist, resulting in myriad ridiculous lawsuits. \\"The proliferation of lawyers in the United States is often compared to the situation in Japan, where the total number of lawyers is smaller than the number we graduate from law school each year,\\" he writes. He doesn't just describe the problem, but offers a realistic solution.<br /><br />For the most part, his chapter on the ethics of war is solid. Here again, however, I don't agree with every position he holds, however. His argument on abortion is flawed. His analysis of foreign policy has proven to be inaccurate by things that have taken place since his book was written. In spite of all these \\"misses,\\" he still has some valid points to make in the book as a whole.<br /><br />Another policy issue that is strong in the book is in the financing of higher education. I don't see why this has never been followed up on in Congress. It sounds feasible. His discussion on tenure was an epiphany for me. In essence he says academe is not the only part of society where it's granted, i.e., that it is implicitely given in other fields. It just isn't recognized as such. Overall this book will make you think.	2005-03-04

Pastor Blackaby uses his own life and family in showing how he's experienced what he is teaching. A broad theme of this book is that as one cultivates a relationship with God by spending time in His presence, faith grows and results occur. God is molding that person in the process of intimacy with Him.<br /><br />We're reminded that God's work in an individual's life has more wide-reaching implications, that other lives are blessed as a result. He provides a useful definition of worship by writing, \\"Worship is a deliberate, steady,focused time with God.\\" He adds, \\"Worship is totally God-centered! God focused!\\" In worship, God reveals Himself, while in circumstances testing comes.<br /><br />Humility is an important part of this process of relating to God. When a person is blessed, it is essential that God be given the glory. Success is a test. \\"The moment I 'take credit' I touch the Glory that belongs to God alone\\" he writes.<br /><br />One slight note that came across in one of the other reviews (I think in a review of the workbook for this work), at times those of us who struggle may have difficulty relating because he did pick the \\"victories\\" to highlight in his life and that of his family. Like every human I'm sure it hasn't been that straightforward, but in the book at times it seems to come across that way.	2005-02-20

That's the way the book starts. I assume there must have been some difficulty finding enough information because while that's the way the book starts, there seems to be a lot of \\"filler\\" material elsewhere.<br /><br />The middle section of the book provides a teaching on angels in the Bible, which is appropriate. This is common on other books I've read on this subject. The weakest part is the final section, which takes about good deeds people have done, equating them with \\"angels\\" in a very loose translation of the word, i.e., that they are messengers of God.<br /><br />In terms of content, only the first section really gives instances of mysterious, possible angel sightings in modern times. On the positive side, it's better to be limited in content than to exaggerate.	2005-02-15

The sources overwhelmingly verify this common theme from myriad sources. Federer documents his work completely, with the end notes being available for further investigation to those so inclined.<br /><br />It is inspiring to realize each generation had its own set of challenges to confront. Praying people were action-oriented. They prayed, they listened to God, and they followed up accordingly. Things were changed for the positive as a result.<br /><br />Federer is to be further commended for showing the reflective process various thinkers have gone through. They did not blindly accept what was handed down to them necessarily, but examined the claims of Christanity for themselves, individually, tesing the spirits...and being convinced in their own individual cases that Jesus is indeed, the Way, the Truth, and the Life. These historical writings leave a legacy of well examined lives. The perponderance of the evidence shows that America was founded by Christians who were seeking to do God's will. They established a \\"Christian nation\\" which they identified as such in repeated cases.<br /><br />Federer even quotes people who have been obstructionists to the Gospel over the years. Even some of these people have acknowledged that the United States is a \\"Christian nation.\\" The editor has done an outstanding job of bringing these myriad sources stretching out over the centuries into one volume. The sections on Christopher Columbus and George Washington are lenghty, but well worth reading. It shows, from their own journal entries their true motivation as opposed to the distortions given by some revisionist speculators.	2005-02-14

It isn't news that the Supreme Court has created law where none existed before. But this book goes beyond description to explain the historical motivation behind this threat to our established \\"by the people, for the people\\" form of government.<br /><br />If the tide isn't turned and laws continue to be made by judges who change their opinions on whims, we will become a nation governed by tyrants, rather than written code. The contradictions he cites by Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy clearly demonstrate how these Justices change their own minds and in the process establish \\"laws\\" that are ambiguous, unpredictable, and chaotic.<br /><br />Robertson stresses the urgency of the matter. This isn't some philosohpical debate. It has direct consequences for Americans. He explains the difference in definitions over the term \\"constitution,\\" explaining that when federal judges use the word they mean laws created by the judiciary, whereas the general public perceives the term to refer to the document creating the republic in the first place.<br /><br />This is an action oriented book.

Consequently he brings a first hand account to his historical record of what it was like in West Africa at the time various countries were gaining their indepedence. Background material of this sort provides a context in which to view current policies and political personalities in the region.<br /><br />One such phenomenon is the answer to the question, why are the boundaries of the various nations not in line with traditional tribal loyalies? Even after gaining independence no such realignment took place. Post answers by explaining, \\"The political elite which led the nationalist movement set itself a geographically limited objective--to capture control of the govenment with which it was most familiar, and that government was the territorial government\\" (p. 63).<br /><br />He goes on to explain that these elites actually denounced tribalism and created myths for the new countries they were creating so that greater inclusion could be felt by the people they were seeking to influence. This book is pretty broad in explanation. A lot of material is covered quite effectively.	2005-01-25

This book fills in the blank spots for a more complete picture of why things are the way they are. He argues convincingly that no all white Americans have had the advantages of a system weighted for their success. The facts are quite the contrary. There has been a systemic bias against certain elements of \\"mainstream\\" white culture that is perpetuated today by stereotypes and misinformation.<br /><br />Webb documents the fact that \\"we didn't all come over on the same boat,\\" with the same starting point. The elite took advantage of the Scots-Irish just as much as they did other groups. It continues today because government programs designed to correct past errors are build on myth, not reality. As a result, the majority of poor whites are still victims of a system working against them.<br /><br />There are some points I disagree with the author on. However, the general premise of this book should become the primary agenda for anyone seeking to discuss public policy from a perspective of truth, not myth.	2005-01-17

Mary K. Baxter spends the first three quarters of this book talking about angels from the perspective of the Bible. She emphasizes that angels are only to point you to God. They are not to be the focal point. They are messengers and agents of God. Furthermore, before accepting her experiences as valid, I looked at the endorsements from the people in the cover of the book. They are all credible people.<br /><br />Having established that criteria as a foundation, I accepted what she presents as her experiences as valid. I could not find anything that goes against the Scripture in what she says she saw. These revelations encourage you to know that the spirit realm is alive, active, and directly influences the material world. That truth itself is scriptural. This book does not call attention to the author or angels per se. It focuses on God.	2005-01-12

This fiction book presents a plot of mystery that shows how various characters lives formed into a pattern that none of them could imagine. It shows how disappointment can eventually work out for a desired outcome.<br /><br />Lena Nelson Dooley is a masterful storyteller who uses her God given talent in such a way that readers are inspired and encouraged.

The book can be summarized by the \\"Twelve Protocols of the Palace\\" in the back. In essence, it can be summed up even more by the principle of \\"seeking the King more than the palace.\\" In this teaching, we're given an analogy between Esther's favor with Xerxes and our potential for favor with God.<br /><br />\\"Influence flows from intimacy,\\" he tells us. As we seek God, the positive ramifications are limitless. Favor from God touches every area of our existence. The ending of the book drives home the point that complete victory comes from those who have God's favor. He describes the \\"switch\\" that took place in the story of Esther as the one who sought to eliminate the Jews (Haman) set the wheels in motion for his own destruction.	2004-12-28

Prayer is active! It is for doers. He begins with a discussion on the role of the Holy Spirit by emphasizing that we are totally dependent on Him. \\"If we try to take one step in our own strength, we will fail,\\" he writes.<br /><br />Dr. Torrey puts the purpose of Bible study into perspective when he advises, \\"Do not study the Bible for the mere gratification of intellectual curiosity but to find out how to live and how to please God.\\" In studying the Bible, he says to do so in God's presence, asking Him to give understanding.<br /><br />This book is filled with reflective statements that help you to examine life. Consider this observation he makes, \\"Nothing more clearly reveals a man's heart than what he chooses and what he rejects.\\" And on living in the present, \\"Those who always do the thing that should be done today are successful for time and for eternity.\\"<br /><br />That's just a sampling.

The theme of this book could be how to become a vessel through which God's blessings can flow. It is divided into seven parts which are designed to help you apply principles from the Bible to you life so you can enjoy the abundant life of a Christian.<br /><br />The first principle has to do with conceiving something in \\"your mind's eye\\" before it is manifested in the physical. We're told, \\"What you keep before your eyes will affect you. You will produce what you're continually seeing in your mind\\" (p. 5). He encourages you to live in expectancy, to look for God's favor.<br /><br />This theme is reinforced throughout this book. The concluding chapter builds to a crescendo that fills your mind with so much enthusiasm that you're ready to go out and do what you've been reading about. This is a book for overcomers!	2004-12-01

Dr. Jeremiah is on an adventure and he's sharing the passion with fellow-travelers. The journey is filled with significance and this book sheds light on some of the mysteries of the ongoing adventure of a life well-lived, i.e., the abundant, eternal life granted by Jesus Christ. Some of the insights of a book of this nature could only be penned by an author who writes from experience. No pie-in-the-sky, theoretical perspective here, Dr. Jeremiah shares principles he's experienced first-hand from God's Word, the Bible.<br /><br />In reaching the crescendo, his excitement is contagious as he tells us, \\"I want to be a pioneer who pushes further and further into that last frontier--the transformaing presence and power of God.\\" He goes on to tie his passion with that of fellow travelers from previous generations, when he adds, \\"for above all, I want to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.\\"<br /><br />One of the sections that particularly spoke to me was on opened doors. There's a connection between seeing an open door from God and pursuing the opportunities within that door. \\"God's open doors are often disguised as problems\\" he tells us. Something happens to us in the process of seizing those God-given opportunities. It is God's way of changing us. This book is packed with encouraging insight for an immediate hands-on application. It will help you to discover your \\"God dream\\" and pursuit it with passion.	2004-11-26

In so doing he has filled a niche that had previously been void. He is to be commended for successfully meeting this challenge.<br /><br />The author's storytelling skills are so captivating that he takes the reader back to the U.B. theology that preceded the activities that later took place in the U.S. He's good at establishing context and developing chronology.

As a good scholar/teacher, Dr. Waitley expands upon this truth, helping us to see it from different angles.<br /><br />Different illustrations and research findings are used as he builds his case in a solid manner. My copy of this excellent book is well-marked. He doesn't just describe the principle, he includes the \\"how to do it\\" component. This book is all any motivational book could hope to be.

Several times I cheated on exams by passing my answer sheet around the back of the room (as I looked at others' answers sheets). These mostly mundane matters would hardly be worth mentioning were it not for the fact that they point to the difficulty, if not impossibility, of maintaining a clear cut and recognizable observational or participatory research role.\\"<br /><br />Having openly admitted to cheating in this instance, how could anything he writes be accepted as authentic? To me this is not a mundane matter, it goes to the heart of ethics. Van Maanen can write and tell a story, but how do we know his cheating isn't part of the plot.	2004-11-05

If the author's hope had been fulfilled, Communism would still be in full operation and freedom of expression would continue to be denied millions of people. The premise of the book seems to be, capitalists, communists, and citizens of developing countries just don't understand each other, we all basically want the same thing, it's just a communication problem. His tone is of someone arrogantly preaching from an ivory tower to the ignorant masses beheath him. It turns out he was the one who is on the wrong side of history. It wasn't a misunderstanding, real differences exist between the belief systems of the various countries.<br /><br />Here's a sampling of the tone used in the book: \\"The good guys are on 'our'side, whoever 'we' may be. The bad guys are on the 'other' side, whoever 'they' may be.\\" His arguments cannot be extended to a rational conclusion when he sees all press systems as being equal.<br /><br />There is some value in the book. In various places he describes a slice of history as it is unfolding in different emerging nations. \\"Political correctness\\" is evident as he makes a big issue of calling developing nations in Asia and Africa \\"advancing\\" nations. He is offended by the term \\"developing,\\" however the literature that exists among those groups seems to indicate they are not.	2004-11-02

Achievers from diverse backgrounds are quoted in this collection of inspirational thoughts for each day of the year, but if you're like me you go ahead and read the material from cover-to-cover and not stretch it out. Either way, there's fuel for creative thought in this book.<br /><br />There are so many good options one could pick to illustrate that virtually any place in the book provides a good sampling. \\"I will look at every victory as inspiration to keep moving forward,\\" is one such quote. On achieving where you are, we're told, \\"The trick is to take what we have been given and make it work for us.\\" And on the equal opportunity positive principles provide to everyone, consider this, \\"We can all prove that great things can happen to ordinary people, because hard work and perseverance are incredibly powerful and effective--should we decide to employ them.\\"<br /><br />Challenges are not meant to defeat one, but to increase one's effectiveness. \\"It's incredibly satisfying to face a challenge head-on and come through successfully,\\" they write. Passion is power! We're reminded, \\"When our hearts are in it, we bring all of ourselves into the game.\\" Such nuggets as these help you to keep going when challenges arise.

Brande tells how to make information known about the two hemispheres of the brain work for you. The advice she offers is very doable and is something that might be overlooked otherwise.<br /><br />A proper balance between acting and planning is stressed. She writes, \\"The man of genius...acts...he creates an event.\\" Creativity is the essence of writing. Ideas come from a fruitful mind and that is a prelude to production. Rest is a significant part of the process. As she puts it, \\"This freshness of response is vital to the author's talent.\\"<br /><br />The discussion of balancing work and rest relates to tapping the unconscious, which must have rest if it is to contribute.

He gets results you can tell by the way he writes. He reminds readers of the basics, i.e., that nothing happens until somebody sells something. Every business is always all about the customer. That is the only reason a business is created or continues to exist. But Fox goes beyond this reminder. He adds \\"how to\\" wisdom on how to maintain this customer-focus.<br /><br />His spin on the unique gifts that each of us has has never been explored in the way he presents it. He says that what is easy to you is difficult for other people. Market accordingly! But just because one has natural talents doesn't mean one can be lazy. Talent has to be cultivated.<br /><br />I like the advise he offers in saying, \\"Invest your time as you would invest money.\\" He explains the power of the 60-30-10 rule, which consists of 60% of your time on marketing/selling 30% learning and 10% fixing weak areas.<br /><br />My only reason for not giving the book a five is he lacks the spiritual component.

The author shares personal experiences of how prayer has changed circumstances in her life over the years. Those who are struggling with unresolved issues will be pleased to know this is not a cliche-driven book of pat answers. This book deals with reality. She describes how some prayers were not answered for extended periods of time, I mean really extended periods! Anyone who has been a Christian for a while knows there are seasons of testing. That's Scriptural! She deals with her questions in an honest, upfront manner, as I said before.<br />A second theme from the Scriptures that emerges from this instructive confessional is persistence in prayer. All the overcoming pray-ers seem to touch on this issue in their writings. That's a good indication that it's one of God's mysterious ways. Perhaps something in the person praying changes in such times. This book gives case studies of answered prayers. It isn't the instanteously before/after type always. It's the kind that take into account the complexities and mysteries that seem beyond our understanding in this life. Just as the heavens are higher than the earth so are God's ways higher than our ways. He is love. He answers prayer. He will not allow us to figure Him out, but He concerns Himself in the details of our existence. These are the type of issues explored in depth in this powerful book.	2004-07-18

The quote actually refers to the editing of a canned stump speech edited slighted for various locations so that local politicians and locations distinguish one place from another on the tour.<br />Noonan allows readers to capture the flavor of the internal fighting among the powers that be in a presidential administration. Nearly everyone can identify with the &quot;experts&quot; being totally wrong in their advice. She discusses several incidences where she was second-guessed by people trying to &quot;help her&quot; improve her speeches and shows how the ones that were unedited were the best received. Virtually anyone in communication can identify with that sort of experience at some level.<br />There's an element of mystery included. She talks about Reagan giving her a joke, mentioning that someday she could use it when she did other things. When he hung up the phone she says, &quot;he knows something I don't know. He knows I'm going to write about these days.&quot; She did and the result tells a lot about human nature, politics, and dysfunctional systems.

The whole book isn't that way, just large sections. Evidently that is the style designed to capture people brought up with short attention spans. If you expect a former presidential speech writer to have a gift of eloquence, you're not disappointed in Peggy Noonan. Her observations cause you to say &quot;yeah, that's right&quot; as she points out things you hadn't really considered.<br />Noonan has lived the examined life, but in writing of one of her former employers (Ronald Reagan) she observed that the unexamined life actually IS worth living, contrary to the ancient philosopher's assertion. In this book, Noonan asks herself, as her readers peer into her private thoughts: &quot;What do I want my life to mean? What do I want the obit to say, what do I want for the lead?&quot;<br />A similar observation is found in her comparision between individual giftings. On a social acquaintance she writes, &quot;He thinks intelligence is a virtue when of course, it's not, virtue is a virtue, intelligence is a gift.&quot;<br />She reminds us of the reality that Christianity is really for rebels. When society accepts it and tries to package it; it loses it's authenticity. Christians historically have been falsely accused, murdered, gone underground, and regardless of what pagans do to destory their faith, it grows stronger all the time. So she's not overly concerned that the social structure doesn't accept it. She says it helps it maintain its authenticity.

Ironically, I agree with some of his criticisms, it's the spirit in which they're made that seems to paint him as an extremist. I label this book as a mixed bag because he has some valid points to make about how mediated, popular culture compares with what earlier Americans experienced in their day. If I had to pinpoint my concern, it's that he seems to have had a premise going into the project and edited his data to confirm his prejudices.<br />To me he hits the target in discussing the clut of celebrity. He compares celebrities in the media age with authentic heroes of past generations. Celebrities are not known for their contributions, but simply for being well known. Since the time this book was written, the problem has grown much worse. I say problem because there are ramifications when such people are chosen as role models. Boorstin's thoughts on this issue are worth considering.	2004-07-09

One could infer it was to point out that Christians are wrong and materialists are valid in their criticisms. I couldn't decide whether to give this book a 2 or 3 star rating because the conclusion of his book is not really valid and he credits the critics more than he does the saints. I rated it slightly higher due to the historical data he presents. It's the analysis with which I disagree.<br />The strongest part of the book is the beginning. He paints the scene of how radically the Protestant Reformation changed European culture. &quot;Protestantism left no room for superstition or magic, but rather made reasonableness virtue,&quot; he writes. He goes on to point out that the Reformers viewed all work as a holy calling, i.e., the &quot;priesthood of the believer.&quot; It's toward the end where his argument breaks down. He fails to make a successful case.	2004-07-08

Lewis: A Biography,Revised Edition	Books	5	10	10	N	N	A Book Lover's Delight	Book lovers are introduced to the subject in an enticing way as Lewis' boyhood environment is described in the opening section:<br />&quot;The house was full of books--I had always the same certainty of finding a book that was new to me as a man who walks into a field has of finding a new blade of grass--through all of these were the works of novelists, historians, essayists and biographers.&quot;<br />On researching their subject, the authors confess in the preface: &quot;This colossal monument of paper contains many hundreds of letters from C. S. Lewis to his father, his brother, his close friend Arthur Greeves, and a few other family connections; it also includes dairies, sometimes kept with great minuteness, covering many years.&quot; So the challenge of condensing this data into book form was formidable. What adds to it is Lewis' quest for knowledge. He read widely and wrote prolifically. The result of this aim at telling the story of a masterful mind is successful, however. We know the essence of the man after having read this inspiring look at his life.	2004-07-08

I decided to go ahead and read it again. It's that good! You are what you feed your mind and this is good nourishment.<br />Dr. Peale talks about being an effective steward of the resources God has given. &quot;In short, you might say it is to make everything and everyone you touch a little bit better,&quot; he writes. This book left me a little better. He encourages you to keep a record of prayers over the years to remind yourself of God's involvement in your life. He talks about trusting God and leaving the results to Him. This is a faith-feeding book.	2004-07-07

This rebuilding of the wall of the city is similar to the process of God restoring His people today. Pastor Hayford discribes the mission of the Holy Spirit as that of helping you to maximize your potential. We're reminded of God's original intent in creating us, i.e., &quot;man, created perfectly 'in the image of God,' was designed for large purposes and deep fulfillment.&quot; He adds, &quot;relationship and rulership are fundamental to our created purpose.&quot;<br />An excellent point is made on time spent with God. It is essential above all else. Dr. Hayford tells us that we discover self-understanding when we're in God's presence. God's nature is revealed to us in His presence, i.e., to save, to heal, to rescue, to redeem, to provide, and to answer.<br />This is a deeply solid book. It is filled with insights that will transform your thinking. Reading it will bring you closer to God. Your confidence will increase as you are reminded that you are His project. He has committed Himself to you and He is working all things together for the good of those who love Him and are called according to His purposes. This book will build your faith and the just shall live by faith.	2004-07-07

He wastes no words in getting straight to the point of how to improve your life. The first attitude he addresses is to approach problems from the proper persepctive, i.e., not from the mindset of a victim, but of an overcomer! Problems are temporary. They help mold character.<br />We're reminded of ultimate reality as Dr. Peale writes, &quot;in the last analysis, only the God-directed life can attain true and basic success.&quot; The work ethic is stressed also. These truths are doable, time-tested, and not bound by any culture. They work if you work them.	2004-07-07

In the introduction we're told, &quot;by expanding your self-image, you expand the limits of your talents and capabilities.&quot; The liberating news for those seeking to change a negative self-image is that it is viewed as a habit which can be changed in six weeks. For those of us who are already familiar with the importance of maintaining a healthy self-image, this book reinforces our beliefs. Sommer explains she was first introduced to the concepts of psycho-cybernetics while in graduate school.<br />The first chapter explains how self-image creates an individual's reality regardless of how accurate it is. It is true to the one who believes it to be so. She goes on to briefly trace the work in the field which came before Maltz's book. She emphasizes that our actions grow out of our beliefs. &quot;People always feel, act and behave according to what they imagine to be true about themselves and their circumstances,&quot; she reminds us.<br />This book is easy to read, yet scholarly based. Her sources are identified and documentation can be traced back to orginal sources for those seeking to explore the topic further. The subject matter is practical. In all this is a good book that teaches you how to improve the quality of your life through the thoughts you think.	2004-07-02

Eberle contends that a new era of spiritual understanding is opening up taking people into deeper truths of the Bible as revealed by the Holy Spirit. He concludes with a call to let love be dominant in the midst of it all.<br />He describes how people with different anointings view things differently because they see things through the perspective of their anointing, i.e., the window God has given them on the world. Taken together, the various anointings supplement and compliment each other to bring about the entire mission of the church as a whole.<br />&quot;The Spirit always places people where He wants them,&quot; he writes. That is reassuring. God's work is manifested through the diversity of giftings. This book will give you something to think about. Some of its content I'm still digesting.	2004-07-02

Faith, Family and Finance to Build a Rich Spiritual Life	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Insightful, Scriptural, Practical ! ! !	T. D. Jakes describes life as a journey in which some people pack more than is necessary for the most productive trip. He wisely advises carry three bags, faith, family, and finances. I think it is no accident that he arranges them in that order either. Faith is needed for this life and preparation for the next. Family is something you can take with you, provided they share the faith and finances encompasses effective stewardship principles that reveal what you have to show for your existence.<br />Although each of these subjects is familiar, Bishop Jakes sheds new insight in each of the three arenas. He builds to a climax in his teaching on Romans 8:28-30. It is worth the price of the book just to read what he says in the few pages devoted to that topic alone! He will build your faith because he speaks from the perspective of a credible source, i.e., it's lived it.<br />This book is comprehensive in that he covers both Old and New Testament teachings on the topics. He includes personal experiences. Bishop Jakes is even confident enough to be vulnerable in places, not one who claims in a phoney way to have all the answers. His advice is practical, doable, workable. I highly recommend this book.	2004-07-02

The author reminds you of some basic Christian principles and elaborates on them.<br />I would say the key point he makes is that things change and if you are persistent in prayer and faith, God will honor that in His time and way. God is the God of the breakthrough. The Bible teaches that quite clearly. In fact, in the New Testament, we're instructed on how to cooperate with Him in achieving His will on earth, i.e., through spiritual warfare. This book explains more about that process.	2004-07-01

He explains his approach to data collection and interpretation. From the title, one can see semiotics is what he uses to analyze his results, while fieldwork is used for collection of data.<br />Readers not familiar with key terms in the field of semiotics will be pleased to know that he defines the terms so they can be brought up to speed. The explanations add to the understanding. This is a good book for qualitative researchers, even those using other methods because it shows the process of data collection and presentation from beginning to end.	2004-07-01

His intent in this book is to enhance the journey. The insights he offers are pretty well thought out. Among the things he discussses is our limited perception, noting, &quot;we see only a small part of the things in our environment.&quot;<br />What a strong case he makes for reading! I was convinced before hearing him out on the matter. He reinforced my bias. Reading DOES expand you as a person. Growth means you constantly change and he spends time developing that theme. Buscaglia says we have an obligation to become all we can be, that we can't give what we don't possess, therefore in order to give ourselves, we need to cultivate what we have to offer.<br />Risk is part of living. He warns, &quot;the person who risks nothing, does nothing, has nothing, and becomes nothing.&quot; And on the significance of everything, he observes, &quot;It's teeny little things that make the difference. Small things, side, by side, by side.&quot; He encourages you to seek other people who are fully alive to connect and help optimize your experiences. The only reason I didn't give this book a full five stars is because he is a Buddist. His savior is dead; mine's alive. A certain amount of error exists in the teachings of anyone unable to follow the logic of Truth.	2004-06-30

That's a pretty good foundation upon which to base a book with this title. Before an individual can know God's will, he must have a relationship with God, therefore the prerequisite is to become born again, born of the spirit, as he explains in the second chapter.<br />From there he goes on to discuss spiritual gifts, noting that the best way to discover your gift is to observe yourself. In the last chapter he offers some particularly useful teachings on God's will and open and closed doors. His discussion includes the practical and the spiritual. This book will help you to discover God's purpose for your life.	2004-06-29

I realize he's a well-known Christian author. Perhaps I was expecting too much from a human being. After all, why should he know more than any of us. We're all seeking to learn. It's just that with a title like this, I was expecting some great revelations. In the preface he even dedicates it to &quot;...my brother...who is still disappointed.&quot;<br />So Yancey puts the issues on the table, discusses them, but doesn't come up with any conclusive insights. Go back a few centuries and you see Job didn't really have any answers for what he faced. It boils down to God is Sovereign. To us His ways are mysterious.<br />Occasionally Yancey has some threads of encouragement sprinkled in this searcher's work. Take for example, &quot;Saints become saints by somehow hanging on to the stubborn conviction that things are not as they appear, and that the unseen world is as solid and trustworthy, as the visible world around them.&quot; I would say the invisible is MORE trustworthy. Scripture teaches that that which is unseen created that which is seen.<br />Yancey's discussion on time is eye-opening. He describes how that as an author he writes a work at a certain time, but it isn't read by his audience until a later point, i.e., a &quot;self contained time zone.&quot; Similarly, God is not limited in His actions to time as we know it. That's difficult to comprehend, which makes it a reality beyond our perception. This book will make you think, but will not necessarily provide answers.	2004-06-29

Faith is given to us to be used and this book helps you to use it effectively. Consider Lindsey's comments on Hebrews 11:11 &quot;By faith Abraham, even though he was past age--and Sarah herself was barren--was enabled to become a father because he considered Him faithful who had made the promise.&quot; Lindsey notes, &quot;The more we learn about God, the more we become certain of the  things for which we hope.&quot; He says our confidence in God grows as we know Him better. He goes on to add that learning about God is a result of spending time with Him.<br />His discussion on the faith and works issue is helpful. Along similar lines he talks about resting from works and not being subject to the law.<br />On the Providence of God: &quot;God never allows anything to happen in a beliver's life by accident.&quot; While on that subject he mentions that God's power is released when we realize we are helpless on our own to bring about God's will. As most experienced Christians realize, &quot;Sometimes God's leading for our life doesn't make sense at all from the human viewpoint.&quot; As one reads the Bible, one sees this has historically been the case, but God's ways are higher than our ways and he knows what is best.<br />This book promotes God dependency, not man self-sufficency. It achieves the goal of the author, i.e., it teaches you how to use the gift of faith God has given you.	2004-06-29

Timelines in the chapters enable the reader to see where the content of that particular section fits in the overall scheme. Sources are clearly identified throughout the book. Sidebars are another asset found in each section.<br />The glossary in the back of the book is a ready reference for students seeking to quickly understand a term.

Dr. Phil writes, \\"I design plans to help get people what they want in life.\\"<br />There are some places in the book that are...shall we say they reveal things about him that he didn't intend. For example he's quite obsequious toward Oprah. Perhaps because she catapulted him to fame. On the other hand he's condescending to other people. He doesn't realize he comes across this way in the book, quite obviously. His arrogance is alarmingly apparent in places.<br />But there are some insights to be found in spite of these weaknesses. For example, he encourages you to \\"focus on results, not intentions.\\" Do people ever need to hear that! A similar insight is found when he points out people fear rejection, but need acceptance. That means life is a risk.<br />I particularly liked this sieze windows of opportunity discussion in chapter six. Again time is the relevant variable, i.e., certain opportunities have a limited window. Sieze the day or miss the chance forever.<br />To sum it up, I felt the book started weak but grew in substance. After the self-promotion and sense of having all the answers in the first few pages were over he developed some substantive thought on significant issues.	2004-06-29

This book will move you emotionally, but it doesn't really leave you any better off in the long run.<br />Fulghum has the gift of communication. He can tickle your emotions, but he just doesn't say much when he's through. His book is full of personal anecdotes. Nothing wrong with that, per se.

Those seeking to enter this field of inquiry will also be a primary audience for their offering. In this book they present a broad overview of the methody of analyzing data collected in qualitative research.<br />On the subject of presenting findings, they are to be commended for explaining the value of the use of a matrix. It is a means of clarifying data for academic audiences. Designing a matrix is an act of creativity.<br />In my opinion they go too far in arguing for the generalization of of results. They sound too much like quantitative researchers. Qualitative and quantitative inquirers have different objectives. There should be no reason to argue for similarities when these differences exist for good reason, i.e., the research questions are framed differently. Different results should be expected. Each method has its set of strenghts and weaknesses. That's why one method compliments the other. Generally speaking, however, this is a worthwhile book that explains what it seeks to explain in a comprehensive way.	2004-06-28

Furthermore, it appears some of the more harsh critics don't want to give the author the benefit of the doubt, i.e., they assume he has sinister motives or a hidden agenda. I don't want to be in the same corner with those of such a vitriolic disposition.<br />It appears to me Tommy Tenney's central premise is, he had a major encounter with God and if you are hungry for God you can experience something similar. He goes on to describe that he wanted reality and not just a form of religion. He uses Scripture to make his case. This book is just a heartfelt effort to call people to a passionate encounter with God.	2004-06-28

Love is an emotion. When we feel it inside, we have something to give. Giving love away is done by successful people regardless of the crowd he notes because, &quot;their own self-worth is stronger than the rejection or acceptance of their ideas by others.&quot;<br />That's a small sampling of the delicious intellectual meal awaiting you in this extremely motivational book.

Many of the obstacles that commonly hold us back from achieving our potential are within our own minds. This book helps you to identify and overcome them. The authors point out that the ten obstacles they discuss are really fallacies and go so far as to write, &quot;these beliefs actually stand square in the way of common sense.&quot;<br />You are challenged to cultivate relationships work, particularly with the boss. Realize that what decision-makers think about you has an impact on your success. Devote time to making the proper, professional impression. Speaking of challenges, they add, &quot;challenge is essential to psychological health.&quot;<br />Along the lines of professional relationship cultivation is the idea of selling oneself. &quot;It is never enough merely to have what it takes. You always have to convince other people,&quot; they advise.<br />Workaholics are seen as being people who cop out because they do what is comfortable rather than what is more difficult. Holistic management realizes life includes more than managing things.<br />One reality that is usually observed but not commented upon is that &quot;in many companies, 'looking good'--understanding the system without being told-- is rewarded more than actually doing the job well,&quot; they poignantly state.<br />These are just some of the valuable epiphanies this book contains.

Historically he has drawn a chronology that sheds light on how the Church endured from one generation to the next across cultures and centuries. He explains, that from the view of Orthodox Christianity, the Roman Catholic Church was the one which did not remain true to its roots, i.e., that it split, not the Eastern Church. That would mean logically that Protestant churches which left the Roman Catholic Church are not the apostolic church of the New Testament.<br />His book is an appeal for Protestants to return to the true church, i.e., the Orthodox Church. While I appreciate his sincerity and respect some of his historical argument, I don't agree with his conclusion.<br />The Church of Jesus Christ is not limited to one select group which conducts a certain liturgy. The Bible tells us all who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. In one place he talks about the Orthodox Church having authentic archetecture. Actually early New Testament Christians met in houses and catacombs and wherever else they could meet.<br />So to me the book's value is in some of the explanations he gives from a historical perspective, but the conclusion he calls for is off base because it tries to add to the finished work of Jesus. We're not saved by joining a church.	2004-06-25

Myron Rush explains how Christian principles apply in the marketplace. I've used this book in sales meetings myself.<br />One of the principles is asking and receiving God's guidance. On that topic, Rush writes, &quot;When you turn a situation over to the Lord, and then get out of His way, He always works things out better than you could on your own. But I'm not really surprised. For as God promised in Psalm 32:8, He will instruct us and guide us along the best pathway for our businesses.&quot; In the margin of my book I made a notation involving something I committed to God at the time I read Rush's book. Years later I serve as witness that God indeed did that in that situation in my life.<br />We're reminded that &quot;God's values, principles, and actions usually are diametrically opposed to the world's.&quot; Rush drives home the theme throughout the book that God must come first in our lives if we are to do things His way. The result, however, is a tremendous amount of confidence that He is in control, that we are merely seeking to do His will and fulfill the purposes for which we were created.	2004-06-25

All you have to do is read the reflective writings in this book to see for yourself. At the same time, he was scholarly, analytical, logical. Wesley was deeply spiritual. In sum, he was multidimensional. Fortunately we get to share some of the difficulty he encountered as we read what he went through at various stages of his life.<br />He agonized over a woman, seeking God's will on the matter. Modern writers would call him a &quot;hopeless romantic.&quot; He wrote, &quot;My heart was with Miss Sophy all the time. I longed to see her, were it but for a moment.&quot;<br />Wesley's personal library must have been extensive because in his will, which is included in this book, there are numerous references to books. The man traveled extensively as one on a mission from God. Many lives were positively influenced by this man of God. His legacy remains in books such as this one. For that we can thank God.	2004-06-25

I didn't know much about Rick Pitino until reading his book, now I can see why he's been so successful in his profession. It isn't just accomplishing goals, it's the winning lifestyle that makes results happen that cause this to be a &quot;quality of life&quot; book. Pitino is passionate about what he does and the people with whom he works. He writes of the maturation process he had to endure himself before arriving at a more holistic view of genuine leadership. Such a person views the success of others in their organization as a mark of personal leadership.<br />This book is packed with &quot;behind the scenes&quot; insights on Patino paying his dues. The coach is so right about there being no substitute for experience. Pitino is a highly ethical man also. That theme is consistent throughout the book as well. This one will charge your battery. I give it my &quot;a-ok&quot; endorsement.	2004-06-24

As the Bible says, his works continue to speak even though he (Dr. Peale) is no longer in this dimension. This book describes his secret. He writes, &quot;...the simple affirmation of the love of God combined with human love possesses an astonishing healing property. Just love people in the name of Christ and in His spirit, and there is a released power that within itself possesses the power to induce healing.&quot;<br />Like his other writings, he lays out the principles, and tells how he implements them in his own life. He talks about a man named Dave Henderson who &quot;was a blessing to everyone he met.&quot; Now that's a worthy goal! Dr. Peale makes it clear he is not talking about self-reliance, but Jesus reliance when he states, &quot;it is belief--not belief in yourself--but belief in Jesus Christ that gives power.&quot;<br />Another common theme reinforced in this book, as in his other writings, is God's guidance. It is a promise of Scripture. Dr. Peale gives examples of how he's experienced this in his own life. He continually emphasizes that &quot;self-improvement&quot; is only possible through God's power. &quot;The name of Jesus is sacred beyond all names,&quot; he writes. This book will enhance your life because it will teach you how to use faith in Jesus to draw upon the power of God to radically change your life in practical matters.	2004-06-23

Books	4	0	1	N	N	Insightful	Bernstein traces his spiritual and intellectual search in this soul-bearing, but scholarly book. In the process of seeking answers to questions that perplexed him, he discovered a new love of the church and its role in an individual Christian's life. Numerous scriptures are used to make his case.<br />I agree with his point, but not his interpretation of the facts. For example, he alleges that Martin Luther and the other Reformation leaders preached &quot;sola scriptura&quot; (the Bible's authority) but did not abide by it. He argues that only the Orthodox Church does. I don't buy his argument.<br />His information on how the canon of Scripture came to the form it is today makes sense. I haven't actually researched it, but I don't buy that the only church qualified to interpret Scriptures is the Orthodox Church. The Body of Christ is mystical, spiritual. God cannot be boxed in by man. Having said that, I think the author is an honest seeker, he's just arrived at a conclusion before his search for truth is over.	2004-06-23

They say they want a separation of \\"church and state\\" when the reality is they want to eliminate ALL references to one specific religion, Christianity. Other religions are promoted in the public square, while Christianity is denied equal access. Anyone visiting the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D. C. can clearly see this first hand. It appears myriad groups have their world religions represented in a positive way, except Christians. That is blatant hostility! It isn't even adequately masked anymore!<br />Limbaugh documents case after case where liberal fanatics threaten, intimidate, and coerce the will of the warpred minority over the desire of the majorty, oftentimes illegally! He clearly shows how runaway judges have created laws out of vacuums. They've completely gone outside the bounds of their constitutional mandate. It's all documented extensively in this well written book. The good news is it isn't too late to reclaim this land for freedom. Our forefathers did so in their generation. Now it's our turn.

Resentment is another negative emotion that he compares to cocaine because if its addictive nature. He points out that resentful people are in the habit of sharing their misery with everyone.<br />His &quot;Good Riddance&quot; chapter explains the solution to toxic emotions, i.e., that Jesus Christ had those unhealthy elements annulled when His hands were nailed to the Cross.

Human beings are &quot;decoders&quot; who interpret information. Scientific theories are human creations seeking to enlighten. The author explains a basic explanation from information theory, i.e., that &quot;in an ordinary conversation, information is conveyed when the speaker says something that changes the listener's knowledge.&quot;<br />Campbell attacks Darwin's theory, writing, &quot;One major difficulty is that the central argument of Darwinian theory circles back on itself, explaining nothing.&quot; He goes into detail on why evolution is unscientific.<br />The brain makes decisions along the way as to what information it will process and how it will interpret what it takes in. &quot;All seeing is interpretation&quot; he writes. He describes the &quot;editing&quot; process of the brain: &quot;...that does not imply that memory necessarily preserves the original meaning intact. The brain goes to work on information while it is being stored in memory,interpreting, drawing inferences, making assumptions, fitting it into a context of past experience and knowledge already acquired.&quot;<br />This is a helpful book on information theory, the workings of the brain, and the process of interpreting what one sees.

Pastor Parley notes, &quot;the covenant of promise cut between David and Jonathan provided for Mephibosheth before he was born.&quot; Mephibosheth was in Lo-debar, an outcast from a rival royal family, yet David showed him kindness.<br />In chapter 4 he drives home the necessity of persisting in prayer. Smith Wigglesworth is quoted on the topic, saying, &quot;I will not move until God moves.&quot; On unpleasant circumstances Parsley writes, &quot;...we should respond to every circumstance with faith, being content in what God is doing in and through us.&quot; This is a faith building book.

These names indicated a certain aspect of His character. It was a method of instruction which holds validity today. &quot;God's name is holy. It should be spoken reverently,&quot; Dr. Sumrall writes.<br />On the subject of worshipping God, he traces the root of the word, telling us, it comes from &quot;the Old English word 'weorthscipe,' meaning 'to attribute worth' to something.&quot; Worship is part of prayer. In explaining more fully James 5:16 about the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man, he says &quot;effectual&quot; means you should pray for specific results. That goes along with faith as taught by Jesus.<br />A good point is made in comparing Abraham and Lot. Dr. Sumrall reminds us, &quot;One man tried to make something of himself; the other let the most high God make something of him. And which one succeeded?&quot; I highly recommend this book. You will learn more about God and how to relate to Him as you prayerfully read it.	2004-06-17

The last one is to wait on the Lord.<br />He ties in personal experience with teachings from the Bible to show how the principles have worked in his own life. I particularly like the way he compared the piling of stones of rememberance in the Old Testament with the keeping of a journal in our times. Both are forms of recalling God's victories on our behalf. This is a solid book of encouragement for Christians.	2004-06-16

This book has a theme that is so simple, yet powerful. It's one that we can never be reminded of too often. Dr. Stanley does a commendable job in driving this theme to the heart of his readers. That simple, yet profound truth is that God is always in control of every situation, He knows what's best, and all things work together for good to those who love Him and are called according to His purpose.<br />Dr. Stanley makes the point that people used by God are the ones who have had to suffer some rather difficult experiences. This gives them credibility in the eyes of seekers. They speak from experience when other people approach them about their problems. There's a lot of reassurance in this power-charged little book.

Knowing God's will relates to relating to Him. The author talks about how his own guidance from God grew out of his &quot;consistent companionship with God.&quot; The secret of relating to God and receiving His guidance is to &quot;trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not unto your own understanding.

He describes how the wind of God takes one to heights beyond one's natural ability. The eagle loses control in the current and is swept up to levels where he is controlled by forces beyond self. Buckingham advices, &quot;lock your wings and let God do the rest.&quot;<br />Chapter 8 is devoted to God given dreams. He writes, &quot;All great men have had their dreams, for dreams are the stuff of which life is made.

If one is to understand interpretation, one must be familiar with these realities.<br />What is &quot;real&quot; is what is real in the mind of the receiver. Individual interpretation is the essence of communication. Blumer makes a lot of sense in describing how people attribute meaning to symbols and objects based on what is real to them.

Feedback was delayed. Arrogance was a consequence. With the advent of the Internet, journalism is more egalitarian. Journalists are more accountable, and interaction is immediate.<br />Stovall's book is full of web sources, many of which are nontraditional.

One of the reasons this book is so authoritative is because the author describes how she overcame these &quot;joy stealers&quot; in her own life. What she learned she shares. The principles are doable, but more significant, they are based on the Bible. The principles work and they can be applied. She even gives specific examples of how they helped improve the quality of her life.<br />Joyce reminds us that joy is power. The adversary knows this and consequently tries to steal joy. However, since the joy of the Lord is your strength, &quot;...there is nothing satan can do to stop you when your heart is full of joy&quot; (p. 192). Therefore, maintaining joy is essential to receiving the abundant life Jesus died to give us. Joy is acquired and maintained in spite of circumstances. She spends considerable time discussing Paul's realization that he had learned to be content regardless of the circumstances (Philippians 4:11-13). Note this is something the apostle learned. Joyce says she learned it and she says we can learn it.<br />Another Scriptural truth that she devotes considerable time to is Proverbs 3:5&amp;6, to &quot;trust in the Lord with all your heart, lean not unto your own understanding, in all your ways acknowledge Him and He will direct your paths.&quot; Trust is coupled with faith in that &quot;there are a whole lot of things only God can fix&quot; (p. 165). Trusing Him means although we don't know what He is doing, we defer to His wisdom and that includes His timing.<br />Growing spiritually is a process. She reminds us, &quot;There will always be things we want to see happen in our lives, but we can learn to enjoy where we are on the way to where we are going&quot; (p. 162). Yes that is a theme she's addressed in her other writings, but the repetition is beneficial. This book builds upon her other writings. Certain themes are reinforced. I strongly recommend this book. It will help you to correctly interpret situations that occur that seemingly don't make sense.ke sense.	2004-05-18

Buckley has some things to say about video ethics in his discussion of that project, specifically about a balance between what staging is acceptable and what goes over the line.<br />Most of the book is captivating, in that, &quot;you're there&quot; with Buckley and his crew members on the journey. However, a couple of chapters are filler. Not even Buckley with his talented gift of communication could conceal that fact. He gets tedious in describing certain maritime procedures (yawn). Otherwise, the time spent with this book is pretty well invested. On that note, he has a small section taking about people asking him as an editor to read their books, wherein he mentions that it takes anywhere from 6-16 hours to complete a book, depending on one's reading speed and the length of the work.	2004-05-12

It discusses how to apply an ancient principle for marketing success. It describes how to reach your target audience through empathy. In short, Larry Wilson reminds us of the value of relationships. Don't let the title mislead you, this book is all about sales, about selling your ideas and yourself. Wilson buys the cliche, &quot;Nothing happens in a business until someone sells something.&quot; He's an advocate of sales, but not &quot;business as usual.&quot; People and their expectations are different now.<br />Culitivating relationships in business is a way of pursuing lifelong customers. His description of how human nature has changed due to the choices available now helps you to position yourself and your company to tap into these realities of the marketplace.	2004-05-06

The other extreme to be avoided is low self-esteem and false modesty. The approach taught in the Bible is to &quot;love your neighbor as you love yourself.&quot; That is the balance he advocates.<br />I love writers who reinforce something I'm already doing. Such is the case with this author who tells his readers to keep a journal. There's other solid advice given such as spend time in solitude, praying and seeking God's Wisdom. We're reminded that we are always in a state of flux and will be as long as we live.<br />In developing this balanced approach to life even further, he quotes Karl Menninger in saying that to be well-adjusted a healthy person needs a combination of play, love, and work. Yes, work is part of the mix. Self-esteem comes from a sense of purpose. Discovering who God designed you to be is part of life's joyous adventure. He notes, &quot;God's blueprint for us is often written in our natures.&quot;<br />The power of imaging is explained in this book. Like me, he visualized himself becoming a doctor before he finished earning the degree. He describes how faith is an integral part of this imagination process.<br />Dr. McGinnis successfully brings his discussion to a logical conclusion by talking about the connection between love of self, love of others and love of God. Those, of course, are what sum up the commandments. Jesus told us that. This book adds some substance to that ongoing exploration. Reading it and applying its teachings will enhance your life's quality.	2004-05-05

He couples the academic discipline of psychology with the teachings of the Bible into a package called &quot;Christian cognitive therapy&quot; which can help you to be liberated from unhealthy bahavioral patterns.<br />In the beginning of the book he describes how people are programmed with inaccurate information about self-control. In talking about one of his clients, he reminds us that &quot;success and excellence require doing things one finds difficult.&quot; Changing one's behavior leads to improved self-perception, which is a bonus from self-control he tells us.<br />Society depends on people controling their actions. He notes, &quot;without some control over our wishes, drives, and appetites, we couldn't live in society.&quot; Dr. Backus identifies self-control as an acquired set of skills that can be learned. This book helps you to learn those skills.	2004-05-05

I took his class at Bowling Green State University as a graduate student and thoroughly enjoyed it. The readings for his course were largely drawn from the field of psychology. As author of this book, the reader will note such an influence. He describes all kinds of personality challenges one could expect to face and how to deal with them.

He had a purpose and he made a lasting contribution. Washington was a Christian, a scholar, a motivator, a writer, an educator, a role model, a scientist, and more. Look at his life, what he wrote and how he approached life and you will see similarities between his thoughts and those of other achievers. Such individuals usually: read extensively, travel widely, and pursue education. This book is loaded with Christian success principles that transcend time and location. I found this book to be extremely inspiring. What would BTW do if he had the internet?	2004-05-04

I think it is well-written, insightful, personal, and philosophical all in one package. His approach to life was essentially life it to the hilt, have something to show for your existence, hence the title. He was not hesitant to enter &quot;the arena.&quot; In fact, his life was lived in the arena. President Nixon was both a thinker and doer.<br />While he lived adventurously on two levels, the mental and physical, he was somewhat neglectful of the spiritual arena. He talks about his Christian parents, especially his mother, but he doesn't address spiritual matters in his personal life in any great detail. I know he was on friendly terms with both Billy Graham and Norman Vincent Peale. I'm sure they had some Christian influence on him.<br />In this book, the president looks back on life as an elder statesman. Some of the advice he gives is pertinent to any arena. When he talks about living with a purpose that transcends self, the focus is beyond political. He devotes time to the human condition, overcoming personal challenges, victories, defeats, and renewals. This is a well-thought out book. Any open minded reader would be stimulated by it.	2004-05-04

He did not receive a listening hear. At a speech before a University audience in Oxford when he told the crowd it was \\"essential for us to be safe in our island home,\\" the audience burst into laughter. The laughter grew so raucous that Churchill could not continue. These are the sort of snapshots that Manchester captures that makes this book such a delightful read.<br />Churchill was written off more than once. This second snapshot describes what happened:<br />\\"Joseph Stalin, receiving a British delegation headed by Nancy and George Bernard Shaw, had bluntly asked her about Winston's political prospects.Her eyes widened. 'Churchill?' she had said. She gave a scornful little laugh and replied, 'Oh, he's finished.'\\" These are just two examples of the thoroughness of this well-written book.

Dr. Schuller tells us his passion has been and remains to help people who are hurting. He sees prayer as an adventure, a mystery which connects us with God. He points out that one of the things that is unique about humans created in God's image, is that unlike other created beings, we can dream. Consider his creative description of Jesus: &quot;my hero--the greatest adventurer of all time.&quot; Jesus is a role model for all Christians, in addition to being our Savior and Lord!<br />Prayer is presented in such a powerful, yet simple way in the opening paragraph of the first chapter when he tells us, &quot;Prayer is all about possibilities. About dreams. About faith.&quot;<br />Talk about &quot;California Dreaming&quot;...Dr. Schuller does in a very profound way. I love what he says. &quot;I fell in love with the mountains. The ocean. Palm trees.&quot; God answered his prayer and sent him to California.<br />My copy of this book is extensively marked. I have portions underlined and comments written in the margins. It is such a powerful discussion of prayer, dreams, God-given direction. It comes from a man who has lived it. Faith, the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. By it the elders obtained a good report. In this book Dr. Schuller will feed your faith.	2004-05-04

Only a qualitative approach can address concerns of this nature. Boyer explains the depth of the professor's role is much more than that of imparting information to students. The one who succeeds in such a role is aware of a much broader set of standards. A professor provides the human touch to the learning process. He or she sets a tone in the daily conduct of affairs. There is some role modeling that takes place. Care and enthusiasm can be detected. Students pick up on people who are authentic. A professor who has a passion for the subject and the students possesses a certain intangible element. Boyer makes college level teaching sound exciting again! His explains help to build a fire of passion in the hearts of those who are in education for the right motive.	2004-05-03

This book seeks to help you in that application. While I don't necessarily agree with the author's interpretation of various Scriptures, there is more positive than negative in this book and its overall purpose is admirable.<br />One way to increase faith is to be reminded of what God has done in the past. This is included in this book as he provides numerous examples of answered prayers. Written records of answered prayers, whether yours or someone else's is a way to feed your faith. There are several such techniques for extending one's faith to higher levels in this book.	2004-05-03

Having said that I can say I am in agreement with the primary thesis of this book. He encourages the reader to risk more, try more, do more, love more, live more. Risk-taking and reflection are at the heart of what he is proposing. A self-sacrificing individual who gives to other people will find &quot;fun&quot; in living, not the one who lives to please self. It seems to me his proposition to live big, think big, take risks and love is right in keeping with the way Jesus taught.	2004-05-03

This is built upon the argument rooted in historical precedent, the Bible, errors made by the Roman Catholic Church, and the virtue of the members of Parliament, according to Milton's logic.

In 1980 Dr. Stuart R. Givens was commissioned to update the history of Bowling Green State University in Ohio. Professor Givens first became associated with Bowling Green in 1952. This book is broad in scope, covering the people, events, and grwoth of the physical plant. Obviously curriculum growth is also included.<br />The book starts in 1910 when the state legislature enacted the Lowry Bill which provided for the establihment of two additional normal  schools. Those two schools were Bowling Green and Kent State. Throughout the book documentation is complete, but reading is made easy by a gifted communicator. Givens has the ability to stay true to the historian's rigor of citing sources without being overly stuffy. I strongly recommend this inspiring book! Those of us who have been blessed to have been students at Bowling Green State University can thank God for the people who had the vision to see it start and expanded over the years.	2004-05-02

In the opening section we're told of the timeless value of principles when Dr. Maxwell writes, &quot;...there are principles of success and there are principles of failure.&quot; Obviously if you want to learn the principles of success you learn from someone who has mastered them such as John Maxwell.<br />He moves from this introduction to the matter of abiding in Jesus. He talks about the Scripture of glorifying the Father by producing fruit. Fruit is produced as we abide in Jesus. We're admonished, &quot;Feed your mind on things that will help you think right and then reproduce.&quot;<br />The section on dreams is quite thrilling. Dr. Maxwell helps us grasp how real, how vital, how life-giving dreams are. Goals coupled with passion lead to success. In writing about prayer he tells us, &quot;We need to look at prayer as taking hold of God's eagerness, not overcoming God's reluctance.&quot; This book will fuel the passion of anyone wanted to live a life of significance in the light of God's standard. It is food for thought for the person consumed with being excellent.	2004-04-30

That choice determines whether we will expeience the benefits associated with the suffering process.<br />Hurts do not endure permanently. Pain passes. Trials end. He tells us to view pain as a process not an event. God has a purpose for everything. People who have made significant marks are the ones who have responded successfully to adversity.

On perception, consider the quote in this book from Karl Menninger, &quot;Attitudes are more important than facts!&quot; Attitude relates to need. We are interdependent and being aware of that truth is liberating. In the body of Christ, we are gifted to contribute to others. In turn, we receive the benefits of other people's efforts on our behalf. Or as Dr. Schuller puts it, &quot;...the deepest need of the human being is the need to be needed.&quot; We need to use our gifts. Our satisfaction comes from making a difference. Humility is admitting we need help.<br />In reading Dr. Schuller's works, including this one, there is a realization that here is a man who is writing from first hand experience. He so powerfully teaches on forgiveness that you just know only a person who has mastered that challenge can so eloquently address the issue. This is an encouraging look at the Beatitudes. One additional point worth pondering is that Dr. Schuller believes Jesus gave them as a logical progression. He believes that one is a stepping stone to the next one.	2004-04-30

No one who has acheived success has done so without adversity. It is in overcoming obstacles that one participates in the process of success building. Those familiar with Dr. Schuller's body of work can relate to that.<br />This book is quite visual. The photos and artwork supplement the narrative in a nice way. Legacy spills over beyond family. As writers such as the Schullers have overcome, the lessons they've learned have been shared with us through sermons and books. We all benefit in a win/win way.

It is about the spiritual forces around us, the mysterious powers we do not fully understand, but occasionally catch glimpses of. This chapter puts some issues on the table to be probed later.<br />The only reason I didn't give this book a 5 rating is because in one place he tries to tie in religions other than Christianity.

A person not knowing the Scriptures could easily be deceived by this cunning work. The way to distinguish truth from error is the Word of God and this book contradicts Scripture throughout. It uses Scripture out of context to build its case.<br />In the opening segments there is such a wonderful exposition given that is in agreement with the Christian Gospel by as the work unfolds, the deception gradually comes out. It starts when she says the virgin birth of Jesus is not to be taken literally.  She talks about it being a myth we all experience. Both of these assertions contradict Scripture. From here she proceeds to try to tie in Christianity will all other religions. Another blatant contradiction of what Jesus taught. It's only downhill from here. The lies which contradict Scripture fill the rest of the book.<br />The Word of God is the standard by which all other ideas are tested. This book fails the test. This is an anti-Christian book that pretends to be something it is not. It does NOT promote truth, it propagates lies.	2004-04-10

He says that neo-Aristotelian criticism is by far the most  dominant mode of rhetorical criticism presently used at the time of the book's publication.<br />The elements of neo-Aristotelianism include: 1) forensic, 2) deliberative, and 3) epideictic. The classifications of proof consist of: 1) logical, 2) pathetic, and 3) ethical.

Wesley's life demonstrates that he reached the goal. He traveled extensively, read widely, wrote inspiringly, and influenced many people to believe in Jesus as their Savior. Thank God for his legacy in words and deeds. He truly practiced and preached.	2004-04-08

What makes this book so effective is that the advice offered is not only solid, but it can be applied immeditely. It's a &quot;hands on&quot; doer's guide. The strength Ken Blanchard brings is his strong Christian influence. Shula's credentials consist of his long term track record as an NFL coach. In this book Shula describes how he leads by example and thorough preparation.<br />One place this book separtes itself from books of this genre is that it emphasizes &quot;follow through&quot; as contrasted with goal-setting. That's an action focus. It puts the spotlight on doing something.	2004-04-07

It makes the point that the tide has turned against anti religious sentiment among decision makers who issue grants. In spite of this new trend, there continues to be a lingering anti faith element.<br />Dave Donaldson describes how a tragedy that occurred in his family early in his life caused him to realize help is needed from multiple sources when such incidents take place. He says the faith-based initiatives are nonpartisan, that they were actually started under President Clinton. President Bush followed through by adding emphasis to what was already on the books.<br />Other places in this book clear up some legal misconceptions. For example, a faith based organization does not have to hire someone outside their set of beliefs if they accept government money. Additionally there are both direct and indirect means of obtaining government funds.	2004-04-07

For that reason I acknowledge that my review of Eliot's work is written with deference to other reviewers, i.e., I rely on their comments after having read Eliot's work. So this review is somewhat synergistic in that I've taken their comments into account as I offer my own observations.<br />One of my favorites in this work is from &quot;Choruses From 'The Rock'&quot;:<br />&quot;The Lord who created must wich us to create and employ our creation again in His service.<br />Which is already His service in creating.<br />For man is joined spirit and body.<br />Visible and invisible, two worlds meet in man;<br />Visible and invisible must meet in His temple;<br />You must not deny the body.<br />...For the work of creation is never without travail;&quot;	2004-04-05

Forturnately they were saved and published. That in itself illustrates the various ways information can be produced and distributed. Being a communicator, I found what Davies had to say to be, what I would consider to be &quot;informative to motivational.&quot;<br />In responding to inquiries about how to be a writer, Davies basically says writers are born. You either have the talent or your don't. He goes on to point out that art is elitist, not democratic, and in fact is older than the idea of democracy. The lesson one could infer from this is, discover your gift and cultivate it. Don't seek to be what you're not, build on your God given strengths.	2004-04-05

Pat Robertson is saying, these are the principles of God's invisible kingdom, if you apply them you will experience the results of doing so. Applying principles is one thing, knowing the God Who gave the principles takes you a step further and that is encouraged in this book also. Learning about God and His ways is wonder-filled, i.e., abundant living. This book encourages you to tap resources beyond the physical, to learn how God's kingdom operates.	2004-04-02

I admit I'm a major fan of Dr. Schuller's because I have been so blessed by his works over the years. This book will encourage you in the things of God. Consider some of these excerpts:<br />&quot;When God gets you where He wants you, you won't be able to do what you have to do without risk.&quot; In other words, God's involvement, which includes faith will be required. As Hebrews 11:6 tells us without faith it is impossible to please God.<br />&quot;When God lays His dream for your life into your thinking, it will be humanly impossible. That's His way of making sure you (1)have faith, (2) will seek His help, (3) cana be trusted with the grand success He plans as a surprise at the top of the peak&quot; (p. 157).<br />I strongly recommend this faith building classic. It will boost you beyond the mundane and if you're already there will help sustain you.	2004-04-02

The essence of this book boils down to the Golden Rule given my Jesus, &quot;do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&quot; That's it! The sum of quality interpersonal relationships is found in that small sentence.<br />On page 48 Dr. Waitley reminds us that we're meant to be contributors in life, not spectators. He writes, &quot;...much of the frustration, depression, and restlessness in society is related to talents that are not being used or properly expressed.&quot; God gave us gifts, talents, and abilities to use, to bless other people.

The myths used to illustrate the principles he was seeking to teach don't accomplish the goal. Take for example his visit with Lincoln and the discussion with Grant. Grant was an alcoholic. Lincoln is portrayed in this scene as a &quot;win whatever it takes&quot; man, i.e., all the other generals had let him down and Grant could do no wrong. Historical ambiguities are lost in this &quot;dream state&quot; we're given in this broad sweep of people, places, and events. It's shallow! I was annoyed by little things throughout the whole book. The &quot;teacher&quot; who turned the whole of history around by one action in the civil war....is another example. Bogus! This guy is the only one who was right and took the right course of action? According to this author. I think more research and a few more rough drafts are in order.	2004-04-01

It begins when the Nazis begin to take power in Europe and tells how the lives of individuals, particularly one family was affected by hiding, relying on God, and coming out victoriously. The mysterious ways of God is an underlying theme throughout all the events that are recorded. Portions of this book will cause you to realize the treasure of just setting with your family to eat a meal without fear of being raided.<br />The spiritual struggle faced during this nightmare is discussed throughout the book also. Seasons of danger cause a person to make those \\"life choices\\" rather quickly. If you're not sure how much longer you have to live, you have to decide what you believe and fast! There are incidences of answers to silent prayers of deperation. In one situation a matters of minutes determined whether a man was going to be saved or executed. This is the kind of book that makes you ask yourself the eternally significant questions.	2004-03-31

Anyone reading the Bible knows timing is part of God's plan. As Joyce Meyer points out, waiting is always going to be part of life. As we grow and change we will always be waiting on something so to enhance our quality of life, we might as well learn to wait well. This is the type of book that could only have been written by a person of substance, someone who experienced the subject matter. You can only write with authority on subjects such as these if you've paid your dues. She has! Consider some of these insights:<br />&quot;When is due season or due time? I believe it is when God knows we are ready, when everyone else involved is ready and when it fits into God's corporate plan&quot; (p. 13).<br />&quot;Your dream is in the process right now! It is on the stove cooking&quot; (p. 53).<br />&quot;Appointed time also means a time already established and decided for certain reasons.

Schuller, it is easy to assume they are so upbeat because they've had an easy life. This insider's account of Dr. Schuller's life makes it plain that that has not been the case and upon further reflection, one realizes everybody faces their own set of challenges in life. In fact, a person becomes a positive influence for good by overcoming challenges. Dr. Schuller's son in law authored this book so he knows his subject matter first hand.<br />I have been an admirer of Dr. Schuller for a long time. His insightful wisdom has helped me in numerous ways to experience a better life than I would otherwise. Reading this book helps you to see the connection that one person's overcoming has a ripple effect on many other lives. Dr. Schuller's victories were victories for those of us who have learned from him. He has been used of God to motivate, inspire, and bless. I pray that I will be such a vessel too.	2004-03-24

He interpretes Romans 12:14, &quot;Bless those who persecutre you; bless and do not curse,&quot; as being connected with this power. He says bless comes from the Greek &quot;eulogeo&quot; meaning &quot;speak well of,&quot; eu=well, logos=word. He writes about pleasing God, and letting God take care of the results.	2004-03-22

It's about how to maintain the proper attitude to enjoy the abundant life Jesus gives. Yes, it is a learned process because life has challenges. In fact, the opening chapter describes life as a process. Waiting is inevitable. In the process we will always be headed someplace else. That's where the title of the book comes into play.<br />We're reminded that as God created different elements, He enjoyed what He had done, saying it is good. In similar manner, she encourages us to enjoy our work. &quot;Relish the moment,&quot; is the advice she offers in reflecting on Psalm 118:24, &quot;This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.&quot;<br />She hits an excellent mark in targeting communicating with God in the mundane tasks, noting, &quot;&quot;Secular things can become sacred things when the Lord is present.&quot; She says she believes ALL of life should be celebrated and enjoyed.

He goes on to talk about being open to the dreams of the Holy Spirit, to the call of God on one's life. This influence of Christian optimism can be found in the names of the places established by the settlers. He reminds us, &quot;New England Colonials were so in love with God's providence that they gave a small town in Rhode Island the name.&quot; The very name is a Christian doctrine, he adds.

He goes on to talk about how God is interested in the visions of each area of our lives. Using Nehemiah's rebuilding of the wall in the Old Testament as an illustration, he describes how God works behind the scenes in the lives of those who pursue His vision. This book is highly reflective, by that I mean he has questions at the end of the chapters that help you to plug into the points being made.<br />What he's ultimately discussing is the life well-lived. In seeking God's vision for one's life, faith and total dependence on God are essential. In living such a life, one is in pursuit of God, the Giver of the dream. Glorifying God becomes more important than accomplishing tasks. Ultimately fulfillment comes from connecting with the Creator.	2004-02-23

We're reminded that before the foundation of the world, God knew us and that He had a plan for us. Connecting with one's destiny is not deciding it, but discovering it. On the matter of hearing from God, he uses Psalm 37:4, &quot;Delight yourself in the Lord, and He shall give you the desires of your heart.&quot; He says two things are found in this Scripture, 1) as I delight in the Lord He places desires within me and 2) He gives me the things desired.<br />On thinking the right thoughts, he notes, &quot;...your life in many ways is a manifestation of what you think about yourself.&quot; His gift of communicating is found throughout the book. I like what he says about blessing, i.e., &quot;I am a blessing going somewhere to happen.&quot;<br />Toward the end of the book he returns to the topic of desires. He teaches that God given desires are provided as a means of directing one in God's paths for the individual. Faith in God is absolutely necessary to fulfilling one's destiny. Focusing on God and His Word, rather than circumstances produces the results desired. The powerful, Scriptural teaching in this book will get you charged up to do, be, and achieve to the maximum!

It is emphasized in the series introduction in the preface of the book that the distinction between qualitative and quantitative research is often misleading and false. The authors elaborate on that observation in their opening comments by noting, &quot;Technically, a 'qualitative observation' identifies the presence or absence of something, in contrast to 'qualitative observation,' which involves measuring the degree to which some feature is present.&quot; They go on to discuss how one knows what one knows and the role data collection and interpretion plays. They acknowledge that individuals' meanings must be taken into account in the process of reporting the findings.<br />The meat of their argument is addressed in the next section as they cite various well known researchers and discuss their contributions. They talk about issues of reliability in these studies and the role of interpreting results. This book helps you to see the challenges of ethnographic research.	2004-02-18

This book is quite conversational and easy to follow. Anyone interested in the personalities of the artists or other decision makers of this period will find it worth their time to get a copy.<br />Some of the interviewees are quite philosophical as they put things in perspective in retrospect. Consider these comments:<br />&quot;But timing is everything. If you walk across the street one second you get across and everything's fine. You try it again five seconds later and a bus runs over you. . . sometimes it's just not in the cards at that particular time. There's no point in crying about it.&quot;<br />This is an insightful book. In any human actions, relationships are important. This issue is addressed as a description of Sam Phillips' handling of artists is given, when we're told, &quot;I think the most important thing I learned from being around Sam was, the thing I was most amazed by, was his ability to handle people, to the get the most our of people, to put people ata ease and get the most out of them.&quot;<br />You can see large portions of the interviews are written just as people responded, without editing. That keeps the material lively and conversational.	2004-02-15

Perhaps the most impressive thing about this book was the climatic ending. He built a solid case for success as a journey throughout the 12 chapters and topped it off perfectly at the conclusion. He saved a couple of surprises for the end. The analogy of pioneers and settlers makes a strong case for effective stewardship in any generation. That is described in chapter 12 also.<br />Success, not only as a journey, but as a process is another strong theme of the book. He quotes John Maxwell throughout the book, and in the case of process, mentions that Maxwell sees it as consistently doing the right things, success will show up in time in the life of a person living that way.<br />His &quot;success magnet&quot; provided insight too. What it amounts to is a new twist on the truth, &quot;success leads to further success.&quot; He writes, &quot;One successful thing always leads to another. Just like the magnetic force fields that surround the earth, success always brings more success. It's a law of the universe.&quot;<br />I strongly recommend this book to success seekers. It will feed your soul with good nutrition. Speaking of reading, he makes a STRONG case for it. Reading is part of the lifestyle of success seekers.	2004-02-14

Although it is local in focus, the issues are national in scope, i.e., it is a look at how national policies influenced the local region. The author was one of the first Westerners to visit Canton after the opening of China. He questions himself whether this region is representative of the entire country.<br />Prior to the take over of the nation by the communists, China was under the traditional imperial system of government. In 1949 the communists took charge. The first chapter describes Canton before the take over. Initially the communists consisted of a small group. Communist efforts to gain mass support were restrained by power realities,&quot; he writes.<br />This book is a good first hand account of what occurred during the period covered. A lot of details are revealed from the interviews he conducted.	2004-02-13

The book's beginning tells us that broadcasting has consequences and that theme runs through the text. We're given clear definitions of the key terms used by media professionals and a historical context of their development.<br />Appropriate charts, graphs, and photos add an element of visual explanation to accompany the written descriptions. The sections on regulation and audience research emphasize the importance of those two components for students interested in entering the field. This book is a good introduction to the industry's founding and place in American culture.	2004-02-10

No experience or teaching that conflicts with the Bible, God's Word, is valid. His Word is the standard by which experiences and teachings are evaluated. Having said that, I found a lot of encouragement in this book. Dr. H. C. Moolenburgh has collected stories people have sent him from all over the world about supernatural visits from angels. Scripturally, the Bible says that God gives His angels responsibilities regarding us, both in the Old and New Testaments.<br />Dr. Moolenburgh reported these findings in this book. Some of the incidents in this book are first hand accounts, others are historical. But the book does more than just report on angel involvement, it weaves a web of truthful teaching. The author reflects on the reports he gives and talks about how the unseen governs the physical. For Christians, this is an inspiring read.	2004-02-08

Leadership is a process that takes time. It does not occur overnight. Leaders are continually growing themselves. In the preface, Maxwell encourages us to use this book as a resource for character reinforcement. He reminds us, &quot;How a leader deals with the circumstances of life tells you many things about his character.&quot;<br />There are so many insights in this book, it is challenging to pick a few to illustrate its value, but consider this one on using both hemispheres of the brain. He writes, &quot;Discernment can be described as the ability to find the root of the matter, and it relies on intuition as well as rational thought.&quot;<br />He encourages us to read biographies and cultivate the gift of intuition through use. He quotes Peter Drucker  who told us to build on the strengths we have rather than concentrate on the weaknesses. On energy and intensity, he writes, &quot;...your passion will have more influence than your personality.&quot;<br />This is an excellent book by an outstanding Christian motivational leader. It builds on his other valuable contributions. John Maxwell is indeed, making his part of the world, a little bit better by his life.	2004-02-07

He says since we are God's highest earthly creatures, i.e., made in His image, it is only logical that He intends for us to accmomplish certain things during our lives on earth and not live in confusion or uncertainty. He talks about God using our natural inclinations, our environment, and the circumstances around us in discovering this plan.<br />It's conforting to know that God takes the initiative in directing our paths if we seek Him, according to the Bible. He promises to continually guide us. We are God's work and we are called to do good works, we're told in Ephesians 2:10.<br />His interpretation of Psalm 37:4 is particularly insightful. He tells us God will give us the desires of our heart if we meet one condition, to delight ourselves in the Lord. Obeying God is a sign that we delight in Him and His ways. This book is a powerfully encouraging one which I strongly recommend.	2004-02-06

Robert Bly takes you step by step through the process of discovering your strength and reaching your target audience with your expertise. An additional section of the book that is worth the cost alone is the section dealing with negotiation. He's been there and writes authoritatively on how to get the value your work is worth and not be pushed around by people trying to denigrate the value of your work.<br />He mixes his personal &quot;war stories&quot; in with insightful quotes from various sources. In fact, I found some of his citations to be educational in making me aware of newsletter I never knew existed. There are numerous &quot;hidden markets&quot; that exist, this book helps you to discover how to search them out, make the necessary contacts, and make your pitch.<br />Robert Bly's success has benefited more people than himself.

In the preface I learned some things I didn't know about Vince Lombardi, Sr., the famous NFL coach, at 34 he was a high school coach, at 46 he was just one assistant coach among many. At 57 he was gone. He left a legacy, however and this book captures some of the wisdom that quickly took him from obscurity to fame.<br />His son, one of the coauthors, tells us &quot;Success isn't in reading. It's in doing. It's in action.&quot; The issue of bouncing back after failure is included in the discussion. We're told it's integral to the process of achieving one's goals. True success is viewed as a lifestyle, not an event. Vince Jr. writes, &quot;Change your belief and you will change your performance.&quot; He reminds us that his dad had to wait until he was 47 years old before he became a head coach.<br />These brief excerpts give just a glipse of the jewels in this wonderful book. Principles from the Bible are used throughout the whole work. Both authors are excellent at what they do. This book should be in the &quot;positive thinking&quot; section of any achiever's library.	2004-02-05

He gives specific advice on how to use this awareness for career enhancement.<br />The discussion starts with the importance of a company's name. That's the first impression the public has of that good or service. Names matter and he documents the fact that large sums of money have been paid by corporations in changing their names due to this reality. From here he goes on to talk about one's personal image.<br />Image matters to self, just as it does to other people. What you think of you affects the way you interact with other people. Buying quality material with which to work conveys a positive image to people observing you. People like to work with winners he reminds us. He also points out the importance of having positive displays in one's work area, such as certificates, recognition awards and such on the wall.<br />This book is filled with solid, practical advice that can be applied immediately. You truly are what you think you are. It comes across. This book shows you how to improve yourself inside and out.	2004-02-05

Kuhn looks philosophically at the process of discovering phenonena, labeling it, and going forward to further inquiry. In other words, he looks at the process of science itself from the point of an outside observer. Scientists operate in a marketplace of ideas like other segments of the culture. Kuhn writes, &quot;Competition between segments of the scientific community is the only historical process that ever actually results in the rejection of one previously accepted theory or in the adoption of another.&quot; That is, facts do not speak for themselves, they need interpretation. From here he goes on to describe paradigm building.<br />Although some paradigms were later, proven to be built on incorrect assumptions, cumulatively in the process of science they led to the discovery of new understandings. They served a purpose, although the purpose wasn't what it was assumed to be initially.<br />If this review goes covers too much, it might as well just be an interpretation of Kuhn's work, which would not accomplish the job of a reviewer. This initial discussion gives you a flavor of the type of issues he addresses. It causes you to ask, why you think you know what you know.	2004-02-04

It clearly delineates the &quot;ten passion secrets&quot; advocated by the author. It begins with knowing what you want, i.e., defining your goal and ends with arriving at your destination. In between those two steps are the other eight which comprise the process entailed.<br />The insightful reflection she offers encourages you to enjoy the process of achievement, not just focus on the result. On commitment, she reminds us, &quot;We develop a commitment to whatever we have spent time on: the more time, the stronger the commitment.&quot; She reinforces the importance of putting goals down on paper, noting that words in print are more permanent, they remind us of what we were thinking at a give time.<br />She has some creative things to say about creativity. &quot;The artist, like the entrepreneur, is primarily a solo type. Their values are generally not those of the majority of the population,&quot; she writes. In terms of like attracting like, she adds, &quot;The only mind that can understand a creative mind is one that is also creative!&quot; This is an insightful book. It's major drawback is it limits things to &quot;looking in&quot; for guidance, when God offers so much more for Christians.	2004-02-04

Of course, there are already overlapping components. The phone and computer come to mind immediately. Media shape messages and the number of participants influences the process as well. Moving on to a second set of circumstances, there's a look at emotional education and mass media. Even entertainment media education. In fact, this subtle approach is sometimes more influential than a hard sell, because it reaches an audience whose barriers are down. It teaches people what is supposedly acceptable behavior.<br />The book is well documented throughout and its contributors are well known in the field of communication. It adds to our understanding of the process and the complexities of sending and receiving messages.	2004-02-02

In the preface Robert Novak tells us he has read &quot;Witness&quot; three times (as of that date, perhaps more now) and reminds us &quot;He (Chambers) views this struggle as inseparable from faith in God, asserting that 'man without mysticism is a monster.'&quot;<br />In considering ideological warfare, listen to Chambers' analysis, &quot;...in the war between capitalism and communism, books are weapons, and, like all serviceable weapons, loaded.&quot; In fact, it is through reading, he tells us, that his eyes were opened. Consider the challenge he lays out as he asks, &quot;Why is it that thirty years after the greatest revolution in history, the communists have not produced one single inspired work of the mind?&quot;<br />Chambers tells us he learned to pray by doing. It started as an awkward attempt, but led into a &quot;daily need.&quot; Consider how he describes the providence of God in bringing the woman who would become his wife into his life as he writes, &quot;Neither of us had much to do with the fact that we met again. Our meeting came about by what the world calls chance, but in which we now see the workings of a grace before which we feel reason to be reverent.&quot;<br />This is a classic for a reason, it's excellent! Historically it records an insider's account of a crossroads moment in American history. It is exceptionally well written. It has my highest recommendation.	2004-02-01

Forms of mentality may, of course, evolve, and evolve by leaps and bounds, but the assumption that at a paricular point in evolution purely physicochemical organic systems transform into psychophysical systems appears arbitrary and unfounded&quot; (p. 152). This book is largely an explanation of systems philosophy, as title implies. One reason he advocates a systems approach is it eliminates the anthropomorphic bias of experience (p. 298).<br />Ludwig Von Bertalanffy writes the intoduction and gives a sweeping overview of the topic. This is followed up in chapter with a continuation of the discussion wherein Abraham Maslow's work is discussed. He mentions that Maslow described two modes of thinking, the atomistic and the holistic. It is the latter which is an indication of a healthy, self-actualized person.<br />Various approaches, such as general systems theory, cybernetics, information and game theory all have a common denominator in viewing entities as holistic systems we're told. Chapter two moves the discussion forward to cover methodology. He points out that isomorphy of laws in different contexts seems to indicate that systems have certain universal similarities.<br />Overall this is a timeless, useful introduction to viewing reality from a holistic, interactive, interdependent, perspective. I find systems theory to be useful in myriad contexts. My drawback is that in places he seems to go a little far in some of his analysis. Generally speaking, however, this book will give you a thorough grounding in the basics of system thinking.	2004-01-31

It concludes with an explanation of how Jesus lived out these fruit elements in his earthly ministry.<br />We're reminded of the importance of the primary commandment, love. He writes, &quot;If you want to measure true spirituality, Paul says, then look to kindness, patience, and those other practical expresssions of love.&quot; Actions speak, as we know and he points it out by noting, &quot;We demonstrate Godly love for others through the way we act toward them.&quot;<br />Joy is viewed as a force that grows out of our love for God, love for others, and love for ourselves. He describes it as the understanding that God is ultimately in control and loves us and that He is working everything out for the best possible outcome even when it doesn't seem that way.<br />The weakest part of the book is the beginning. His communication is not representative of what is found in the rest of the book. After the first few pages it is much better.	2004-01-30

Furthermore, various media have been highlighted during different eras, e.g., sometimes film, other times radio, then later television.<br />This book provides an insightful overview of the field's development.

He says the actual label should be the parable of the unjust employer, as the employee was fired on hearsay. Life consists of words and works and one point made in this parable is the need to live in the now, to be an action oriented person.<br />Holistic stewardship is taught, in that, we are to be effective in both tangible and unseen resources. The most significant resource we have is the knowledge of who Jesus Christ is, i.e., we are stewards of the mystery of God. He tells as, &quot;As you look back upon your life, nothing will seem as important to you as the people you have won to Jesus Christ.&quot; All that God gives us, every resource is to be used with eternal purposes in mind.<br />He points out that dependability in small things is essential to the kind of stewardship Jesus taught. &quot;Character is revealed in little things,&quot; he writes. Life, cumulatively speaking, consists of doing a large number of small things well. It's all stewardship.	2004-01-30

Professor Friedmann shares his successes, but he doesn't ignore his failures. Failure is part of the road to success in any endeavor. The only person who hasn't failed is the one who hasn't attempted anything of significance. In this insider account, we're given a look at the various markets and media forms available for aspiring writers.<br />The accompanying CD is a bonus.

He notes, &quot;TV is a populist medium, and so the challenge comes down to finding ideas that will capture the zeitgeist.&quot; This book is part biographical, but more weighted toward giving an inside view of the system and personalities that comprised the entertainment industry during Tartikoff's career.<br />A visit he made to Bob Hope's home illustrates the &quot;inside&quot; type information found in the book. He talks about coming upon a vault. &quot;Inside were rows upon rows of alphabetized file cabinets,&quot; he says. It was his collection of jokes. He mentioned to Hope the possibility of putting the material on computer, to which the comic genius responded, &quot;Now why would I do something like that? Everything I need, I know where to find--right now.&quot;<br />If you're interested in television of the mid 1980s to mid 1990s you'll find this book a match for your tastes.

That's true for managers of media organizations and this book. In fact, the first few pages talk about how rapidly changes in information companies are occurring. Some of the philosophical and practical issues described in this book are still pertinent. Another enduring feature of the book is some of the history it contains. A further value to the book is that some of the theories of management demonstrate the evolution of thinking in that dimension of a manager's job. The best of each of the theories is still relevant. The irrelevant can be eliminated quite easily enough.<br />There are organizational charts and graphs in this book that help illustrate the text. Terms are defined which are still valid in today's business operations. The research throughout this book is well documented. I recommend this book because it is still very useful in the media world of today.	2004-01-27

Similarly he talks about taking opportunities as they present themselves as a form of guidance. If you're in a circumstance, do what is best at that time and place.<br />He also points out that God may have a person in a place for a while, but things change and there comes a time to move on.<br />One assurance that is given to people who might fear missing God's direction is that God takes the initiative in guidance. If we're sincere in wanting His will, He will see that His will is done, Smith emphasizes. He tells us the Shepherd illustration in the Bible is reassuring in making this point clear. Not only that, but God's guidance is a gift!<br />There are some areas in this book where I completely disagree with the author. Overall, however, I found more positive than negative--by far.	2004-01-27

Dr. Nuland tells us that a stable system is not a static one, but one that is constantly changing and adapting. The paradox is stability means instability. Although his background is medical science, he has the courage to admit that medicine is an art. Going back to his system's paridigm, he says we are greater than the sum of our biological parts. From that statement he makes an inference, saying by our own choices, we can enhance what we've been given physically.<br />He returns to this healing theme later in the book by noting, &quot;All growth and all healing depend on the ability of cells to divide and thereby reproduce themselves.&quot;<br />While the book presents fascinating insight on the body's physical functions, it totally misses the mark spiritually. When he comments on those matters, rather frequently in the margins my comments are &quot;bogus&quot; and &quot;spiritually blind.&quot; He knows the external functions, but he is woefully lacking on the unseen part.	2004-01-27

The book is divided into manageable segments which place the theorists into understandable blocks. Before introducing the various theories, however, he discusses the nature of academic inquiry and what theory building is all about.<br />His various categories of theories include: general theories, thematic theories, and contextual theories. A person familiar with the writers in these various categories will find this book easy to follow, however beginning students need to be prepared to spend a little extra time with some of this material as it can be challenging when you're exposed to it initially.	2004-01-27

This life is brief! Sure he had some adventures and overcame some obstacles, but this life is not all there is. Having made my disclaimer, now on to Pritchett's look at Chekhov.<br />We're told that Chekhov often slept in a shed that was filled with a lifetime collection of newspapers his dad stored. What a haven for an inquiring mind. Chekhov also had acquired a passion for travel. Another vital component in the mix of the adventurer.<br />Communication is two-way. For one to write, one must have some substance. That is obtained through input, and we're told \\"...like all talented writers, Chekhov was a reading man.\\"<br />He read travel writers such as Przhevalsky, Humboldt, and George Kennan.<br />Chekhov was a traveler, a reader, a writer, and a scholar. This is an intriguing look into his rise to prominence. How sad that he focused only on THIS life.	2004-01-26

It reinforces what I already believe. This is representative of that genre.<br />In talking about the books in his personal library, Miller mentions that his habit was to mark extensively in the margins of the books he likes. That's a habit I possess too and find it to enrich my reading experience by reinforcing key ideas, and providing a source of reference when I go back to that book later.<br />He equates reading well to writing effectively and sees both as part of the same creative process in a sense. Miller sees the Creator as being the source of good ideas whether communicated through a writer's pen or through the thoughts of a perceptive reader. He says the best readers are writers. In terms of content selection, he notes, &quot;The good reader will gravitate to the good books.&quot;<br />Consider what he says about the process of reading when he writes, &quot;Is it not strange to understand and enjoy what is incommunicable? Man is not communicating with man through words, he is communicating with his fellow man and with his Maker.&quot; However, as a Christian, I cannot accept Miller's theology because elsewhere in the book he writes, &quot;Long before I had accepted Jesus Christ, I had embraced Lao-tse and Gautama the Buddha.&quot;<br />I do agree with him on the value of reading,however. He celebrates other readers and presents them as people of action. He says reading adds a dimension to life that would not be there otherwise, a depth of understanding that is acquired only when that portion of the brain is exercised properly.<br />While I strongly oppose his religious stance, I agree with his advocacy of reading. It is with that qualification that I recommend this book. Read it and enjoy it, but disregard the attacts on the Christian faith.	2004-01-26

He has published extensively and presented at numerous conferences. This book does a good job of providing the basics of how media systems operate economically. It is well documented, easy to read, and full of charts and graphs that illustrate what is being described.<br />Terms are defined clearly throughout the book also. Contextually, this is a prerequisite to understanding media's influence on its audience as he explains in the first chapter. In terms of media literacy, many consumers would benefit by learning more about media production and distribution. This book helps them do so. Media are part of the economic system in which they're based.	2004-01-26

A niche of American history is covered that sadly, frequently goes overlooked. The Scotch-Irish are a substantial part of the U.S. population. Thankfully Dr. Leyburn told some of the story and it wasn't lost. He tells us in the foreword, &quot;Histories of Scotland rarely devote more than a paragraph to the departure of thousands of Lowland Scots to Ireland in the seventeenth century.&quot; It is significant to Americans because &quot;they came, two hundred thousand strong, to the American colonies in the eighteenth century.&quot;<br />They enthusiastically supported the American Revolution (as in significantly caused it to happen) and thought of themselves as &quot;Americans&quot; rather than Scotch-Irish.<br />This book covers their migrations, their lifestyles, the dominant element of the Christian religion in their society. It is informative, and to me, inspirational.	2004-01-25

This autobiographical glimpse of the man allows the reader to empathize with the loneliness of growing old without a mate. Although his life ended on less than desirable terms, there are some positives in his story as well. Hammarskjold made the most of the hand he was dealt in life. One can see an evolution of his thoughts over time. The book starts somewhat chaotic, but to the patient reader, the growth that emerges is worth the struggle of reaching the climax.<br />Various other thinkers are quoted in his &quot;markings.&quot; Sometimes it's a stream of consciousness type reflection that is recorded.<br />Consider this &quot;marking&quot; from 1956, &quot;We act in faith--and miracles occur...Faith is, faith creates, faith carries.&quot;<br />Here's another jewel from the following year: &quot;We have to acquire a peace and balance of mind such that we give every word of criticism its due weight, and humble ourselves before every word of praise.&quot;<br />And another excerpt: &quot;In any human situation, it is cheating not to be, at every moment, one's best.&quot;<br />To conclude this review here are some final thoughts that show the power of his concluding reflections:<br />&quot;...He (God) is wholly in all you meet...<br />...each of your acts is an act of creation...<br />...everything, therefore, has a meaning.

'We're all individuals here on earth, and we don't all yearn for the same things.

Here are a few samples from this book:<br />&quot;...I'm starting with a positive picture of the person I think God created me to be, and faith that He will help me become that person.&quot;  Carol Kuykendall<br />&quot;If we always wait for perfect conditions before embarking on any endeavor, we will miss many of life's grandest opportunities. Perhaps it's faith that I'm talking about. It doesn't take faith to accomplish a sure thing. Faith is needed when the outcome is in doubt, when the odds are long, when our chances of failure make us white-knuckled and wobbly-kneed.&quot;<br />Fred Bauer<br />&quot;I listen. How different, I thought, from trying to mold events toward some preset outcome.

Chuck Swindoll goes on to tell us how to do that. He describes people who reflect a quiet, peaceful calm as being those individuals who have cultivated a perfect trust in God. Such a mindset liberates one to be the distinctive person God intended.<br />Swindoll writes from a profoundly deep perspective. Only an author who has been tested himself could write the following:<br />&quot;God has trusted each of us with our own set of unfair circumstances and unexplained experiences to deal with. Can we still trust in Him even if He never tell us why?&quot;<br />He goes on to answer the question he posed by saying, &quot;..it's good simply because God Himself has allowed it. Acceptance is resting in God's goodness.&quot;<br />Job of the Old Testament is used to illustrate complete acceptance of God's will. Job trusted God totally, although he did not understand what was occurring in his life.<br />Read the section on worry. He offers five problems associated with it that enable you to see its deceptive powers. He also helps you to overcome it. I strongly recommend this book. It will deepen your relationship with God if you read it with the proper mindset.	2004-01-20

It discusses Christians being effective in the marketplace on a spiritual level. No distinction is made between &quot;religious&quot; and &quot;secular&quot; work, i.e., if the work is done as unto God, it is His work. He traces the various movements throughout the centuries of church history to show how this generation has more insight and revelation to act on revealed truth than those in previous generations.<br />Every saint is called to be an effective minister for God's purposes. Those who do not work in formal church settings are not &quot;second class&quot; in God's perspective, they have been called, appointed, and assigned to the work they're doing. That is refreshing. The argument he makes on this is convincing.  This book inspires you to be your best for your Creator, to be the wise steward He desires.	2004-01-20

Each day has an inspiring excerpt that is easily grasped. Consider, for example, the December 5 entry where he reminds us of the need for continual rewewal. He writes: &quot;Habit 7: 'Sharpen the Saw' is personal Production Capability. It's preserving and enhancing the greatest asset you have--you. It's renewing the four dimensions of your nature--physical, spiritual, mental and social/emotional.&quot;<br />That is the purpose of this book, in essence. It is to remind us of the need to be continually renewed and refreshed. This book is designed to do that mentally. I find it inspiring.	2004-01-19

In the margin I dated it and wrote &quot;I do too.&quot; This book contains so much rich, practical, doable wisdom, not wonder it's a classic for achievers. Persistence leads to desired results. He quotes Robert Collier in making the point when he noted, &quot;Success is the sum of small efforts--repeated day in and day out.&quot;<br />Ziglar talks about seeing one's self in the mind's eye as a prelude to accomplishment. &quot;I dreamed overy forty years ago that I would be traveling the world, making speeches to every conceivalbe kind of group. I literally saw myself in front of vast audiences making those talks,&quot; he tells us.<br />On feeding success mentally, he reminds us of the necessity to surround ourselves with people who are going to edify us. He adds, &quot;read good books.&quot; This is one such good book. Read it!	2004-01-19

I have Daily Guideposts dating back to 1984 and frequently I refer to them.<br />In this particular book, the theme is &quot;Praying Together&quot; and the contributions by various authors approach the subject from myriad perspectives, althought they are each clearly Bible based and Christian. In the middle of each month Pam Kidd has an entry on &quot;The Practice of Prayer&quot; which is awesome!<br />Over the years I have read the Guideposts contributors so frequently I feel like friends.

He talks about the people who helped him on his journey and he adds experiences from other overcomers in the mix as well. He talks about God giving him the dream of communication, which became a mission, and eventually an accomplishment. Encouragement is vital to sustaining one's dreams in the midst of challenging circumstances he notes. He received it from his speech therapist at Sioux Falls College, Mary Patterson. He went on to an outstanding career in broadcasting.<br />Reading about the stories of the achievements of the various people in this book from many different backgrounds is truly inspiring.

All decisions are consequential in some way. The authors tell us \\"Making a decision is telling people who you are.\\" You are revealed through the decisions you make.<br />Toward the middle of the book they discuss having an internal dialogue with yourself to determine who you really are. This is designed to help you evaluate which goals you consider to be worth pursuing. Living life is much more rewarding that simply passively existing. They note, \\"To be passively involved during most of your leisure time in fantasies--your own or somebody else's--could mean that your life is lacking in real satisfaction.\\"<br />A person \\"creates\\" his or her own life by the decisions made on a daily basis. The mental choices lead to actions, actions lead to experiences, and cumulatively life progresses. Readers are encouraged to confront and overcome any mental assumptions that hold them back from living life the way it was meant to be lived.	2004-01-17

We're told that thoughts deceive us all the time. One of the purposes of this book is to think deeper thoughts and grow beyond the facade. Risk makes one vulerable, but it is rewarding in that as it is taken, the potential gains are worth the effort. The only real losers are those who refuse to take risks.<br />Good emotional health is addressed in chapter three. It covers forgiveness. A person refusing to forgive only hurts himself or herself. He makes a similar point in the eleventh chapter when he writes about exercising one's mind regularly. He adds, \\"No matter what happens, never blame anyone--or anything--for the way you feel.\\" The issue is ownership of one's emotions. People who feel in control are less likely to be stressed than those who feel like they are victims of other people or circumstances.<br />On the matter of doing something is better than doing nothing, i.e., activity is desired over passivity, consider the quote he uses from Thomas Carlyle, \\"Every noble work is at first impossible.\\"<br />The insightful wisdom contained in this book can improve you thought life and thus enhance your quality of life. I recommend this book.	2004-01-16

This excellent book stirs one on to productive activity for God. The issue address is that of the quality of one's life. Jakes writes, &quot;...the question isn't how long we live but how well we live. What matters are the moments we live life to the fullest.&quot; That theme is eloquently explored throughout the remainder of the book. Essentially maintaining a high level of quality in life relates to making the right choices consistently. &quot;Choosing which to respond to and which to ignore help you to maximize your life,&quot; Jakes points out.<br />Adequately eliminating some things is one wise decision that can be made. We're encouraged to cut off things that aren't working in our lives. Like other writers in this genre, the author believes God created each of us uniquely for specific purposes to be accomplished in our lives during our time on earth.<br />A creative discussion of desire is developed. He equates it with intensity or passion, noting &quot;intensity focuses on how badly we want it while objectives focus on the specificity of what we want.&quot; He couples relationship development with passion for goal attainment and advises not to partner with people who lack passion for the vision. Diversity in relationships add depth that would otherwise be missing. Healthy relationships result when strengths are exchanged he tells us.<br />His section on the necessity of rest is particularly refreshing. Not only is it essential to proper health, but it enables one to enjoy the journey.<br />This wonderful book is so full, so rich, so delightful that a review can't capture the fullness of the inspiration it brings. This is the type of reading successful people do. I had heard the author speak on TV on several occasions. In reading this book I saw a depth to him that oral delivery can't portray. He writes in such a way that you KNOW he's a reader. Buy this book! You'll have a richer life if you apply its teachings.	2004-01-16

Dr. Peale begins by talking about his friend, the late Ely Perry of Kinston, North Carolina who \\"never ceased to amaze me by his insights, his depth of understanding, and his zest for life.\\" He tells us Mr. Perry had an extensive personal library of spiritually based motivational books, each one extensively marked with comments in the margins. He uses his friend to illustrate the value to be gained from interacting regularly with achievers who have left their legacy to us in print form. Books contain thoughts that significantly impact one's life. Thoughts are mental food. We get to select the diet. He uses his mother as another illustration, writing \\"her books were marked and marked again, and any sentence that was good was underscored.\\"<br />Like all of Dr. Peale's other books, this one is full of practical wisdom. He doesn't just cite the principles, he teaches you how to apply them. This book truly does live up to its title.	2004-01-16

He writes, &quot;... you are the customized expression of a loving God.&quot; He describes the process of success as being ongoing and discusses how to maintain the momemtum. Discovering one's area of giftedness and building on that in a way that glorifies God is the essence of the book.<br />He devotes more discussion on specific ways of discovering one's giftedness and how to apply that knowledge to everyday life. The weakness of the book is the extreme to which he takes his argument. He sees dramatic shifts occurring in society to accomodate people's giftings. His proposals are far from practical. Sometimes one simply has to work outside one's giftedness tempoarily, e.g., when one is in college.<br />The first part of the book is the strongest. His insight is helpful in getting a better handle on how to live in a targeted, fulfilling manner.	2004-01-16

His starting place is a description of the value placed on community. He writes, \\"A man could remain comfortably in colonial Massachusetts only as long as his actions and his ideas coincided with those of his neighbors.\\" In its founding, we're told that provincial governors viewed themselves as servants of the Crown. The transition to autonomous government was gradual. \\"It represented the very real choices of thousands of men around the colony upon the advent of the royal charter of 1691\\" Zuckerman tells us.<br />Throughout this book, documentation is provided that shows the evolution of thought as the decision-makers made transitions. This book sheds light on a given time and place in a very readable manner.	2004-01-15

It encourages a fresh approach to Christianity, a more authentic application of the teachings of Jesus.<br />The author's intent is to cut readers away from their preconceptions and see things without cultural limitations.<br />He talks about the &quot;divine impulse&quot; and quotes the Scripture that the Holy Spirit will lead us into all truth. Sheldon writes, &quot;If Jesus' example is the example for the world to follow; it certainly must be feasible to follow it.&quot; This book aims to demonstrate how practical Christianity is lived out in the day to day world.	2004-01-15

Robertson acknowledges that he has sought God's will continually and he is unsure why things turned out as they did, but he writes as a honest seeker who is searching for answers. He has some insight, but is unclear on other matters. He says upfront that he thought God intended for him to win the race, yet it didn't turn out that way.<br />Consider the weightiness of his probing as he writes: &quot;I've been walking with the Lord for more than thirty years and I'm still learning the difference between the voice of God and the voices of my clamoring spirit, of the world, and of Satan...I may believe something is God's will, and it turns out not to be.&quot;<br />In spite of his lack of total comprehension in this matter, he has learned enough about God's guidance that he offers principles for receiving it. This is a helpful book for serious seekers, written by a man on the same journey they're traveling.	2004-01-15

It is packed with wisdom, built on the solid base of the Bible. Consider the opening statement, \\"Almost everything we enjoy today was impossible yesterday.\\" Mason reminds us that achievers have always been dreamers. They have always \\"seen\\" what was not apparent to the mediocre mind. He goes on to tell each reader, \\"There's a mission residing in you, put there by your heavenly Father. You see, He specializes in the impossible.\\"<br />Achievement is not the only theme of the book. He ties achievement in with living a quality life. His approach is holistic. The principles he presents are timeless, yet the gifted way in which they're presented is fresh. This is the type of book you will want to relish. I was in no hurry to finish it. I spent time reflecting, underlining, and writing my comments in the margin. You will be so thankful if you buy this book, read it, and apply its teachings.	2004-01-14

We're told that some people cancel out their prayers by praying for one result, then expecting another. Worry focuses the mind on the opposite of the desired result. Biblical prayer is faith-centered, i.e., the desire of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen (see Hebrews 11:1). Reading this book helps one to pray more effectively because it conditions the mind to expect the desired outcome.<br />Keeping Joseph (in the book of Genesis) in mind, we're reminded that what the enemy means for harm, God can turn for our good. He is so creative, He can create good out of chaos. Prayer causes us to realize God is at work in circumstances and to expect His intervention. Meyer writes, \\"Remember we are not the potter, God is, and we certainly don't know hot to 'fix' people.\\"<br />On the issue of praying fervently, what she teaches reminds me of something I read by Dr. Norman Vincent Peale along the same lines. She says such praying involves putting one's whole self into prayer. All the mind, the emotion, and the will are included in praying fervently.<br />This is a powerful, life-changing book. Its insight is practical and all encompassing. Read it, mark it, put it into effect.	2004-01-14

America's &quot;Dream Coach&quot; suggests that in order to make your dreams reality, you take action in the direction of your dreams. After identifying one's passions, followup should be made in the form of acting on those discoveries. A dreamer must start the journey where they are. Waiting for ideal conditions is futile.<br />&quot;Start by thinking about your dream as real,&quot; she writes.<br />Visualization is an essential component of the process. &quot;Picture yourself already living your dream,&quot; she encourages. In other words, the dream starts in one's mind's eye. Seeing (internally) is believing. Be cautious with whom you share your dream, but to trustworthy friends and fellow dreamers, communicate your vision. &quot;The more you speak and write about your dream, the sooner you'll live it,&quot; she advises.<br />This is a inspiring book on focusing on the things that will enable you to determine your target and hit it. There is much practical advice in this highly recommended book.	2004-01-13

If one considers the &quot;examined life&quot; to be desired, the situations in which Dortch found himself provided furtile soil for him to either get bitter or better. His choice was the latter.

Living above it is Christian, it is the abundant way of living Jesus taught. In this book based on the Scriptures, Chuck Swindoll shows you how to apply principles that result in living purposefully and joyfully.<br />Like similar writers, he starts by explaining it all occurs in one's mind. When one's thoughts are right, proper actions follow. Being conscious of the invisible, eternal Kingdom of God is the awareness that changes one's perception from things seen to those unseen.<br />He writes about resisting traditionalism, greed, and discouragement. His advice is practical and doable. This is a hands-on book designed to set you apart from those who are satisfied with the status quo. It is a challenge to rise above the fray to a higher level of existence, one based on God's Word.	2003-12-21

In a creative, compelling, easy-to-read way Joyce Meyer shows you how opportunities for living out the fruit of the Spirit are available everyday. This book truly does show you how to turn negatives into positives by seeing them in a different light. Rather than experiencing frustration, turn the situation into a stepping stone of spiritual growth.<br />I'll use just one small example to illustrate. When in a checkout line and the cashier has run out of tape on the cash register and seems unable to replace it in a timely manner, rather than being frustrated, you can model patience, tolerance for others, and even pray for the person.<br />She says the two &quot;bookends&quot; of the fruit of the spirit, i.e., the ones listed first and last which make all the others function are love and self-control. In describing her own struggle at growing in these areas we all encounter, she makes herself realistic. Just as she had to grow, so do we. These disciplines do not occur automatically.<br />Who doesn't want a life of peace? This is included in the fruit of the Spirit and the chapter discussing it is worth the price of the book. Actually, since you can't enjoy anything without peace, that chapter alone is priceless. Buy this book! Read it! You'll be thankful you did.	2003-12-20

He lets you see what a aristocratic (but Chrisitan based) family was like in the days of the establishment of the United States as a country. He talks about travels, influences, and personal reflections.<br />Since the theme of his book is his personal education, a thought he has on that subject seems appropriate for a review. He writes, &quot;Unless education marches on both feet--theoryand practice--it risks going astray...&quot; That philosophy seems to be consistent throughout the generations. If you like to compare your thoughts with those reflective adventurers of other generations, you'll like this book.	2003-12-10

Having said that, I think Weber has some validity, but his sociological explanation of how socieites fuction is lacking.<br />He does not equate capitalism with greed. He explicitly states that and goes on to define a capitalistic economic action as &quot;one which rests on the expectation of profit by the utilization of opportunities for exchange, that is on (formally) peaceful chances of profit.&quot;<br />Weber contends that &quot;business leaders and owners of capital, as well as the higher grades of skilled labor, and even more the higher technically and commercially trained personnel of modern enterprises are overwhemingly Protestant.&quot; He goes on to discuss how the teachings of Calvinism bring this about. He talks about stewards on earth having heaven as an ultimate goal. This is a classic, thought provoking book.	2003-12-09

Du Bois Institute)	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Thought Provoking	I read the book with the goal of learning more about Nigeria and its people. Obviously this book is from a very biased source, however, in reading of the horrors in his native land his bias is understandble and only logical. There is a lot of pathos, intense emotions in his description of the crisis in Nigeria. As a scholar/journalist I like to hear all sides of a complex issue so I feel like I've heard one perspective from a first-hand witness after having read this book.<br />As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, unless one is familiar with the key players in Nigerian politics it is difficult to grasp totally what is being discussed. Also, since the book is composed of various presentations given elsewhere it lacks a certain amount of cohesion.<br />With that aside, I feel like I know a little more about the country after having read it. The book isn't long. As I read more I hope to understand more of what is taking place in that country. I want to be part of an informed public that can help do something about the plight of victims of dictators.	2003-12-09

Books	4	7	7	N	N	Shares His Experiences	Dispite the odd title he has some encouraging things to say in this book. He uses personal experiences to teach truths from the Bible. He sums up the most important matters on page 31, &quot;We must understand our mission in life--to love God and to love each other, and to glorify God through excellence.&quot;<br />He has a tip on eliminating stress, i.e., to change both your expectations and your perspective. He adds that the medical profession has acknowledged that adequate leisure time is essential to maintaining one's health. Also along the lines of stress reduction and rearranging one's thoughts, he provides a pithy insight from Leonard Thomas who said, &quot;If you want to test your memory, try to remember what you were worrying about a year ago.&quot;<br />Toler defines worry as &quot;unfaith.&quot; He says it is not compatible with faith. He adds that it is &quot;the misuse of God's creative imagination which He has placed within each one of us.&quot;<br />These are the type of topics, insights, and quotes one will find in this book. Just reading it will help reduce your stress because it focuses your mind on God and His Word rather than your problems.	2003-12-09

In this wonderfully writte book, Ben Patterson couples personal experience with academic study to give an inspiring teaching on prayer.<br />His teaching is practical. He says prayer is like swimming, that you learn by doing. He talks about the joy and value of being in God's presence. In several places he goes back to the original languages in the Bible to make a point. Consider his explanation of a Christian calling. In Latin &quot;vocare&quot; means &quot;to call&quot;, from which our English word vocation comes.<br />This book is inspiring as well as motivational.

In writing about wrong attitudes, they note, &quot;hate always impoverishes the hater.&quot;<br />Any book that points one to Jesus is doing a worthy deed.

Books	4	4	4	N	N	Descriptive	Even though this book is somewhat dated now, it still has a purpose in that it provides a look at what one innovative facility was like at the time. For example, an opening observation made by the founder and director of the MIT lab, Nicolas Negroponte still applies, i.e., that all communications media and technologies are poised for redefinition. In terms of innovation, Brand writes &quot;Once a technology rolls over you, if you're not part of the steamroller, you're part of the road.&quot;<br />We're told that Negroponte views all communication technologies as a single subject and the process itself as a craft. He divides advertising into two categories, &quot;advertising as noise&quot; and &quot;advertising as news.&quot;<br />This book goes to show that while the delivery systems are always changing, content is significant. Some of the technologies which were relatively new at the time this book came out are commonplace now. The philosophical insights Brand makes are worth consideration at any time.

His words will inspire and motivate you to do more and be more than you are now. It's a delightful, playful, productive process he's describing that leads to enriched living.	2003-12-02

God's guidance is a second theme of this chapter.<br />Chapter four talks about the importance of thanksgiving. He discusses the importance of living in a spirit of graditutude.

It seeks to explain how one draws valid meaning from qualitative data. The focus of the book, as a consequence, is analysis. The authors see themselves as logical positivists. Three components of analysis are: data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing/verification.<br />Like a large number of other scholars, they see compatibility between qualitative and quantitative research. They contend that &quot;qualitative research can be outright 'confirmatory.'&quot;<br />This book covers the basics of doing a qualitataive study.

A quote from Oswald Chambers provides the context, &quot;God speaks in the language you know best...through your circumstances.&quot; If you seek Him and His will, He will guide you as He promised. Like similar Christian authors, they remind us that while circumstances are outside out control, the way we respond to them is not.<br />Success does not happen instantly, it is a process that occurs as small things are done consistently. Worthwhile things result from discipline and discipline applies to every area of life: financial, physical, mental, and spiritual. They tell us, &quot;Your dreams won't come true if you allow them to languish.&quot;<br />This is a book for achievers. It prompts one to keep on taking the steps of the abundant life Jesus describes in the Bible. As we recognize God's involvement in the details of life we can relish the process and realize that even the challenges occur for a reason.	2003-12-01

God's very presence releases tension. When we walk in His ways, as contrasted with our own, we replace the negative with the positive, i.e., frustration, confusion, distortion, despair, and destruction are eliminated from our thoughts. In His presence we learn His ways.<br />The times and seasons of our lives are in His hands. She tells us to approach God with the spirit of &quot;whatever you want is what I want.&quot; God opens and closes doors as is appropriate.<br />Reading this book helps you to gain a perspective on truth.

He's an intriguing storyteller and this book is a nice balance between the personal and the historical. By the nature of the writing one can pick up a sense of his judicial philosophy, in fact he writes about the work of the court, &quot;the individuals who comprise the Court at any particular time have a great deal to say about the kind of decisions that the Court makes.&quot;<br />In terms of judicial philosophy and the role the constitution assigns the third branch of government, one should take from this book an observation about that topic if one takes nothing else: &quot;During the Constitutional Convention in 1787 it was proposed that the Supreme Court be granted a power to 'revise' laws passed by Congress, but the convention rejected this proposal. Justices of the Supreme Court have a great deal of authority, but it is not an authority to weave into the Constitution their own ideas of what is good and what is bad.&quot;<br />I recommend this book. It is good reading and it provides historical insight from a personal viewpoint.	2003-11-30

Dr. Peale starts out reminding us that Jesus said He came to give us life and to give it more abundantly! (See John 10:10). From that Scripture he goes on to tell us that &quot;You can do no more than you believe you can.&quot; Actions begin with the seed of belief. This book is designed to plant the right seeds of belief within its readers.<br />Faith enables an individual to get in harmony with God. It is through trusting Him that the supernatural is manifested. He emphasizes this point by encouraging us to continually fill our minds with possibility thoughts. Replace doubt with expectancy.<br />A familiar theme that he drives home in this book and other works is that what you visualize in your mind is produced in the physical dimension. Consider the statement he makes on faith and results when he says, &quot;Think big, and powerful forces are released.&quot; Planning for inspiration is essential to the achiever's lifestyle. &quot;Travel, music, art, stimulating friends, and good books contribute to inspirational living,&quot; he reminds us.<br />Some profound thoughts on God's perfect timing are also included. We're reminded of the need to synchronize our timing with His, and that as Christians He lives in us.<br />Dr. Peale is a master at communicating truth from the Bible.

He had something of substance to say, not simply due to this interactive form of communication, but because he was also a Christian leader who overcame the trials of life. Although Tozer was a man of action, like other men of action he knew the secret was in cultivating a relationship with his Creator. He tells us &quot;The man who would know God must give time to Him. He must count no time wasted which is spent in the cultivation of His acquaintance. He must give himself to meditation and prayer hours on end.&quot; That is the secret of Tozer's ability to communication truths that are permanent.<br />He goes on to point out that the people who made lasting contributions were the ones who experienced an encounter with God. He reminds us that &quot;God hates artificiality and pretense.&quot;<br />Tozer's reflects hit the spot. He writes in such a way that a reader is inspired to meditate himself.

Foust does a commendable job of describing and analyzing the process of regulating radio's clear channels. The systems approach he uses is similar to that taken by Krasnow, et al. in their book. Dr. Foust provides details of how the industry acquired the ability to define the issues in economic terms and held on to that interpretation while using consumer groups to pay lip service to &quot;the public interest.&quot;<br />Specifically he talks about how farmers groups were courted by the licensees of clear channel stations. They masterfully talked out of both sides of their mouths in that they would talk about providing programming for rural listeners, while all the time actually filling their schedules with content designed for urban audiences.<br />This book is a study in compromise in the process of regulation. The story unfolds like a well scripted plot. The FCC has always voiced its interest in local control, somehow that has NEVER been realized in the history of broadcasting. This book shows it the telecommunications system we inherited evolved as it did.	2003-11-27

Maxwell says &quot;A hardened attitude is a dreaded disease&quot; and the way to overcome that is to focus on God's power and not the problem.<br />Maxwell has a gift for putting truths into a fresh framework. For example consider what he says about one's life being affected by attitude, &quot;Our attitude and action toward life help determine what happens to us.&quot; In other words, he's about to go into a discussion of self-fulfilling prophecy. He goes on to talk about how attitude affects relationships and other areas of life.<br />He issues a challenge that I want to someday try myself. He says for the next week, treat every person you meet as the most important person on earth. Imagine the results!<br />This book is packed with goodies.

Actually Schaeffer wasn't the first one to come up with the idea, it was Jesus who told us to let our lights shine. They begin by pointing out that one's worldview impacts the actions and assumptions one has. A person with a Christian worldview will act based on the assumptions of that view, as a secularist will based on the worldview he holds.<br />The founding of America is described as a miracle. As citizens of a country blessed immensely by Him, we have a responsibility.<br />Documentation on references to God and Jesus are given. Various states' charters are cited in this section of the book. Various founders of the country are quoted also with solid and clear references to God and Jesus. The case made in this section is strong!<br />Accepting one's responsibility is not optional. We are accountable for the resources we've been given in our generation. Do the good works God has assigned in the various arenas of His choosing. This book helps you to see that every life makes a difference.	2003-11-27

Dr. Peale begins by explaining the concept of imaging as a form of &quot;mental engineering&quot; which is derived from the term imagination. He goes on to add that &quot;a long-held visualization of an objective or goal can become determinative.&quot; He says this process has worked for him. He cautions that this method is not some form of magic, that it opens doors, but once those doors open, it is up to the person to follow through with discipline, work, and persistence.<br />As a Christian, Dr. Peale points out that the power of imaging is secondary to a more important thought, that being that &quot;there is an all-powerful Being in the universe who loves me and who is only a prayer away.&quot; He talks about a relationship with Jesus Christ being more significant than goal-accomplishment or any other thought, achievement, or creation seen or invisible.<br />This book will help you improve your quality of life because it contains so many truths.

The book is divided into three sections: the man, the movement, and the message. Peale started in a Methodist setting. His family was active in the denomination and Peale attended Ohio Wesleyan, where he earned average grades. Peale is described as a loner who is comfortable with a crowd of  4,000, but ill at ease with in a small group.<br />Peale was a avid reader. This habit was part of his persona throughout his successful career. She goes on to talk about his first pastorate and how the passion for travel was cultivated.<br />Dr. Peale's work was his hobby. He threw himself into it totally. He wanted to make Christanity practical, doable, applicable to the everyday world. In radio's &quot;golden age&quot; Dr. Peale took to the air to propagate the Gospel. In applying what he preaches, he advocated living as opposed to overindulgent self-reflection. His thoughts were, &quot;The overly examined life would inevitably discover problems therefore,'The best was to live is just to live.'&quot;<br />Many of us continue to be blessed by the legacy of this man of God. His good works remain. The fruit of his labors are still sprouting. This book tells how it all started.	2003-11-26

In writing on the internal rewards of creativity, he says &quot;There is no question that to survive, and especially to survive in a complex society, it is necessary to work for external goals, and to postpone immediate gratifications....The solution is to gradually become free of societal rewards and learn how to substitute for them rewards that are under one's own powers.&quot; One such system of internal rewards is the enjoyment of accomplishing something creatively. He says such an experience can become a positive addiction.<br />In the flow experience, one loses a sense of self in that one expands beyond self to an &quot;undreamed of state&quot; of consciousness. One is lost in one's work. &quot;Everything the body can do is potentially enjoyable&quot; he tell us. He quotes Thomas Carlyle saying, &quot;Blessed is he who has found his work; let him ask no other blessedness.&quot;<br />There are some highly useful insights in this wonderful book. He causes you to realize overcoming obstacles is not the exception, but the expectation in life. Flow is the process whereby creatively overcoming challenges is redefined in a positive perspective.	2003-11-26

His is definitely an interpretation of facts rather than a mere conveying of the information.<br />Durant's story of the Renaissance starts with Petrarch and Boccaccio. He describes details of the studies, discoveries, travels, and adventures of these inquiring souls. Of Petrarch he writes, that he &quot;took up his residence in Venice in 1361, and lived there for seven years. He brought his library with him...&quot; At a later point he adds about Petrarch, he &quot;took his books with him.&quot;<br />The strength of this book is that it gives the human side of some of the creators of this era whose works have stood the test of time. He helps you to see why they thought what they did and the process used in making their contributions. The downside is the heavy editorializing of the author. There's as much interpretation as there is history.	2003-11-25

Your assignment is to discover where you fit in matching your uniqueness with meeting needs. It's an exciting approach to living!<br />Like similar books in this genre, he says relationships are more important than work. Espicially is this true of one's relationship to God. He talks about geography being important in one's assignment. This book is full of insights from the Bible. Consider his comments on time, &quot;God uses time to achieve His own goals on earth. He uses time to develop the seeds of greatness that He plants in the soil of people.&quot;<br />You will be a more effective steward of your time, talent, and life after having read this book.

It is filled with truths from the Bible and quotes from myriad sources. Consider, for example, this quote from George Mueller, &quot;Be assured, if you walk with Him and expect help from Him, He will never fail you.&quot; A similar quote from C. G. Trumbull, who wrote of Dr. John Douglas Adam that, &quot;I learned from him that what he counted his greatest spiritual asset was his unvarying consciousness of the actual presence of Jesus.&quot;<br />She writes much about character development and overcoming obstacles. Perserverance is a theme of this book. She reminds us &quot;Power is developed by resistance.&quot; A quote from Ruskin tells us, &quot;Not without design does God write the music of our live.&quot;<br />This review has not done justice to this book.

Wilkinson believes each one of us has a dream that is as unique to our identity as our fingerprints or personality. Furthermore, he believes God planted that dream inside us and if we don't fulfill our mission, something significantly consequential will not happen in the lives of people who need to be touched by our God-given dream. The logical is sound if you read this book grounded in principles from the Bible.<br />Like other dreamers, Wilkinson says the process never ends. As soon as one major dream is accomplished, it serves as the launching pad for a bigger dream. Vitally important though is the relationship between the dreamer and the Dream Giver. There are some eternally significant issues addressed in that area, but in order not to spoil the plot, I'll just advise you to read this book. You'll thank me for recommending you do so. Your life IS meant for eternally positive consequences. Trials are part of the process.	2003-11-24

Norman Cousins was a journalist who was healed through changing his behavior and thoughts. As a followup to his experience he was brought to the UCLA Medical School to do further inquiry into the topic. He interviewed physicians, patients, and family members in his study.<br />He discusses how his findings were misinterpreted and made to appear shallow by critics. But he felt that he had a valid contribution to make to our understanding of ourselves.<br />Philosophically he makes some cogent points throughout this book. Personally I love what he writes about Southern California. Consider also his comments on life well lived:<br />&quot;The clock provides only a technical measurement of how long we live. Far more real than the ticking of time is the way we open up the minutes and invest them with meaning. Death is not the ultimate tragedy in life.&quot;<br />Buy this book! Read it!

He reminds us of the statement made by Jesus, &quot;He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.&quot; An analogy helps make his point on the importance of hearing God, that like skiing downhill blind, we cannot see even a portion of the future, but the Holy Spirit is our Guide.<br />Two way communication is vital to relationships. In our relationship to God, listening is necessary in prayer. The one who listens to God and responds positively will hear even more, Lord writes. In order to listen effectively, external distractions must be eliminated.<br />There are many practical tips on hearing God more effectively in this book.

Cultivation Analysis is a methodology that has been used by researchers to view long term as opposed to short term media effects. In the first chapter, Professors Morgan and Signorielli provide the overview to this method.<br />The second chapter talks about how divergent psychological processes exist in the construction of social reality from mass communication sources. Professors Hawkins and Pingree explain that &quot;the messages that lead to cultivation are aggregate patterns of action and characterization across many programs or even seasons of entertainment television.&quot;<br />Other chapters view media influence as other factors enter the mix. This is a useful book for looking more realistically at how audiences are affected by media because its perspective is long range.	2003-11-16

Perhaps its because I don't have a clear enough understanding of Satre, his background, or his era to grasp what he's trying to say in this work. I underlined various points that I thought might reveal a conclusive theme, but still am not convinced I've comprehended his point clearly.<br />He talks about treatment of the Jews in different countries in various time periods. He says the Russian government  considered the Jews in Russia and Poland to be unassimilable, but favored them as a means of stirring up dissention among the Polish people. As the Nazi party gained power in Germany, the first step, according to Satre, was to prohibit Jews from using the same swimming pools as everyone else.<br />He affirms, what to me seems to be common sense and evident on his face, i.e., \\"there is no French truth or German truth; there is no Negro truth or Jewish truth. There is only one Truth, and he is best who wins it.\\" Although I'm not sure what he means by \\"winning it.\\"	2003-11-15

Various media forms are given attention in subsequent chapters.<br />A seque is made to viewing media holistically from a systems perspective. From here we're taken to a discussion of media effects. This section of the book starts with the assumptions of the magic bullet theory in the early days of media research. It is explained how these assumptions and early theoretical works proved inadequate to explain the complexities of the actual workings of media upon audiences.<br />In the final section of the book media in contemporary society is addressed.

Until that time his powers were ripening, not so much slowly as secretly.&quot;<br />Huizinga starts his history of Erasmus with his childhood. He was born in Rotterdam, Holland in 1466. His years in the monastery are covered in the second chapter. We're told he was well read in Jerome. Furthermore he was consumed with the works of St. Augustine. In the summer of 1495 his studies carried him to the University of Paris. It was on this campus that a struggle of ideas was occurring. The story continues as Erasmus goes to England.<br />Erasmus was a true wandering scholar at times with no home of his own. In describing his travels, his studies, his love of God, his calling, the modern Christian scholar can sense the continuity of the personalities who went ahead to pave the way for our contritutions.	2003-11-14

He seems to have never met a skeptic, cynic, or doubter that he didn't like. In his view of Islam, Judaism, and Christanity, it appears to me his favorite is Islam. His least favorite is Christianity. He operates from the assumption that people created their own religions and borrowed what they liked or disliked based on such variables as the climate in which they lived. Pretty superficial reasoning I'd say.<br />His interpretive commentaries are largely mumbo jumbo. He rambles as if he is a wise man who knows truth because he is a materialist and all these ancient people were blinded because they believed in things beyond the physical realm. If one were to infer an underlying tone to his book, it could be, &quot;if you're really intellectual like me, you're a cynic who doesn't believe in any of this religious stuff.&quot; That the framework from which his analyses are made.<br />With that established the book has some value. It provides detail of the various personalities and issues covered. Some key historical figures are described at length. Durant is a gifted storyteller, but as a reviewer I'm suspicious here. It seems he's more interested in entertaining than conveying facts at times. That's why I would seek a verifying source if I really had doubts about something controversial he says occurred.<br />Read and compare. This is another voice in the human chorus. Just keep in mind he's coming from his worldview, which he doesn't even attempt to hide. Take it for what it's worth, one man's spin on history.	2003-11-14

For an educator he has a surprising confession, &quot;I didn't much like school, and barely remember most of my teachers&quot; he tells us.<br />He describes his college days, followed by graduate school. After obtaining his own education he entered academe on the other side of the desk and eventually got into administration, becoming a college president.<br />At this point in the book he segues from personal reflection to his thoughts on larger issues. We've all been victims of bureaucracy at some point. Hopefully he is right in predicting this dysfunctional managerial system is coming to an end.<br />In the next couple of chapters he hones in on two of his areas of expertise, leadership competencies and managing the dream. He continues on with his thoughts on various other matters. Overall it is interesting to see his perception on his own life and his thoughts on broader matters.	2003-11-14

Consider the fallacy of the inner light, i.e., one's own internal inspiration. He says such people who worship the god within worship themselves. He is not talking about the Spirit within in this case, he's talking about self-worship.<br />On health matters. He says there is something unhealthy in the mere pursuit of health. Consider his observation about courage, &quot;Courage is almost a contradiction in terms. It means a strong desire to live taking the form of a readiness to die.&quot;<br />On things unseen he writes about miracles and people who believe in them. &quot;For some extraordinary reason, there is a fixed notion that it is more liberal to disbelieve in miracles than to believe in them. Why, I cannot imagine, nor can anybody tell me.&quot;<br />He adds that those who believe in miracles do so because they have evidence, whereas those who disbelieve do so because they have doctrine that teaches them so.	2003-11-13

It has to do with attitude. The Bible tells us to have the same attitude Jesus had. He came to serve and we're required to do likewise. Brother Lawrence served and found joy in doing so. There were no minimal tasks to him.<br />Brother Lawrence reminds us &quot;God knoweth best what is needful for us, and all that He does is for our good.&quot; He lived his life with that childlike trust in God.<br />He talks about God hiding from us sometimes. He discusses faith being tested. Although he lived a simple life, he was a profound thinker and his work has impacted generations.	2003-11-13

The aim of good works is that God is glorified, not man, Andrew Murray tells us in the beginning of this book. Waiting on God is part of the work process. Offering oneself as an instrument through whom God can work is the chief objective of life, Murray writes. Work is the &quot;highest form of existence&quot; he adds, noting that we are defined by our work. We are what we do in a sense. In maintaining a Christian perspective, he places work in the context of love, noting that &quot;The most Godlike thing is love.&quot;<br />Fruitfulness is an outcome of work. Fruit is produced spontaneously. It isn't forced. Murray presages Rick Warren in discussing how fulfilling one's God-given role with talent and ability leads to a sense of satisfaction. He goes so far as to say &quot;The works of a man not only reveal his life, they develop and exercise, they strengthen and perfect it. Good works are of the very essence of the Divine life in us.&quot;<br />Murray sounds a theme found in Robert A. Schuller's work when he talks about Divine work requiring Divine intervention. Dr. Schuller similarly talks about a God sized dream, one that cannot occur unless God is involved. Faith is a necessary part of such a dream becoming a reality.<br />In the conclusion he returns to the opening comments about waiting on God. If one is to achieve what God designed him to acheive, it will have to be done God's way. That can only come about as one waits on God.	2003-11-12

It is full of practical advice from a man who has the credentials to support the advice he's offering.<br />He begins with a definite of consulting and through a process of elimination tells what is not included. He reminds us that &quot;You grow based upon exploiting strength, not acclimating to weaknesses.&quot;<br />Myriad ways of getting one's name known are explored. One such method is publication. He says he has published more than 300 articles. I'm sure he has added more since this book was out. He also networks through public speaking and offers some advice on successfully working that arena.<br />Building relationships with clients is important and he describes the process of doing so. Earning and maintaining trust is vital.<br />His advice on writing is solid whether applied to that activity or elsewhere. He writes, &quot;If rejected, resubmit, resubmit, resubmit.&quot; In other words, don't give up. Persist! That's advice to be followed by any would be consultant.

This textbook provides a thorough overview of the field of broadcast/cable programming. Industry terms are clearly defined and incorporated into the description of the various topics covered. The book is divided into easily identifiable cataegories, which assists in digesting the material.<br />It's appropriate that a book of this nature start with a discussion of the central theme, in this case programming. That is done quite well in the first chapter. The constraints unique to the broadcasting industry are at the core of the industry and are addressed in that manner.<br />Audience research is essential to professional program executives doing their work well. That's the topic of the second chapter. Again, industry terminology is explained.<br />Numerous broadcast experts had their insight to the various issues throughout the book. There is a diversity of perspectives presented. Various organizational structures are included. Radio, television, cable, national, local, and non-profit are all part of the mix.

These two professors describe how to get a wider audience for your ideas. They have the credentials. In the back of the book there's a summary sheet on each one telling the extensive media coverage they're received, locally, regionally, and nationally.<br />They argue that one's academic credibility is enhanced by media coverage. But, in working with the media, they point out, a news source has to be ready when media people need them. It may not necessarily be at the convience of the interviewee. The first step in getting in the arena is to prepare a one page, media friendly fact sheet, listing your content areas and an overview of your background. Next, learn the players, who the gatekeepers are and &quot;work the system.&quot;<br />Keep in mind, you're talking to the masses. Don't lecture. This isn't a university class. Keep it simple and easy to understand. Write for the general public. Op-ed columns, magazine articles, and newspaper features are ways of gaining initial media attention.<br />There's some very practical advice in this book. I've worked in both arenas, the media and academe. I can see how the two sometimes miscommunicate. This book goes a long way in breaking down those communication barriers.	2003-11-09

Keep in mind Lowell Thomas was exploring the world when broadcasting and air travel were new. That's what makes this book so thrilling. He was a pioneer in these areas and describes what it was like in his day. Added to this step into the future, is his link with the past, i.e., when he was a boy the U.S. West was still being developed. So his era is a link between two particularly novel eras.<br />In fact he begins with describing his relocation, as a youth to Colorado when it was being settled by those seeking wealth due to the gold rush. He gives details about the mining towns and the type of people who were drawn to them. &quot;Dreamers and drifters&quot; who usually didn't find their riches, but established cities like Denver.<br />Thomas was an educated man. He attended college and even worked for a time on a campus before entering broadcasting. He describes how he got into the international travel experience and how it led to his becoming a reporter who told audiences in the U.K. and the U.S. of his adventures in places unfamiliar to them at the time.<br />Quite honestly this book spurred my intensity to more travel myself. I'd like to see more places, experience more adventure, live more fully, and do in my generation what Thomas did in his. Fortunately for us, transportation is more affordable and available on a much wider basis now than then. Read this book! I think it will ignite your passion for life too.	2003-11-09

Audubon saw himself more as a scientist than a painter, although he is largely remember for his art.<br />This book describes the tension between the newly founded U.S. and the &quot;mother country&quot; from which we had just won a revolution.

The four loves Lewis covers in this book are: affection, friendship, eros, and charity.<br />In the early part of Genesis God tells us it is not good for the man to be alone. Eve was created to meet this need. Anyone who denies this reality is denying the truth of what God said. We are not just spiritual beings, we live in a body and we need other people.<br />Consider one's love for his or her home country. Lewis argues that this is a legitimate love. In citing Chesterton, he explains that a man not wanting his country to be ruled by foreigners is similar to him not wanting his house to be burned down in that the reasons are too many to list.<br />Affection comes from the Greek word &quot;storge&quot; and refers to the kind of love found between a parent and child or child and parent.<br />Friendship, he says, is the least jealous of the four types of loves. He makes an observation worth noting, &quot;those who are going nowhere can have no fellow-travelers.&quot; Frienship strengthens us.<br />Eros is sensual love. The stimuli gains and sustains our attention. We become totally focused on the object drawing us toward it. He reminds us that St. Francis did not respect this part of his humanity, calling his body &quot;Brother Ass.&quot;<br />Charity is selfless love. &quot;We were made for God. Only by being in some respect like Him, only by being a msnifestation of His beauty, lovingkindness, wisdom or goodness, has any earthly Beloved excited our love,&quot; Lewis writes.<br />Jack Lewis helps us to gain a clearer understanding of the different ways we love. This book isn't just for the sake of acquiring more knowledge, it helps you to express your love more fully after having gained that understanding.	2003-11-07

On his dad's side there was the Welsh lineage. He describes them as being sentimental, passionate, and rhetorical. While the Hamiltons, on his mother's side were less passionate, more critical and ironic. On both sides, his parents were &quot;bookish&quot; people. He says his brother was a blessing to him, although the two of them were different also.<br />I love the description of the house full of books in which he grew up. He writes: &quot;My father bought all the books he read and never got rid of any of them. There were books in the study, books (two deep) in the great bookcase on the landing, books in a bedroom, books piled as high as my shoulder in the cistern attic, books of all kinds reflecting every transient stage of my parents' interest...&quot;<br />He talks about staking out his claim in the attic and making it his study. Early on he became a reader and writer. It was a love affair with communication. He discovered his gift and pursued it from then on.<br />This book traces the stages of his spiritual journey as well. He is very straightforward in describing what was going on in his mind at various stages.

About midway through the book Colson tells us the two men who died on each side of Jesus could represent all mankind in that we either recognize our sinful selves and acknowledge that we need a Savior or we curse God and die. This book is written for those who want to obey the Savior and love the Lord our God with all our heart, all our soul, all our body, and all our strength and love our neighbor as ourselves.<br />On relating to other Christians, Colson reminds us that God has given us each other for our mutual benefit. We are to love each other from a sincere heart.<br />In writing on holiness, Colson sees it as an every day affair, i.e., &quot;the believer's ministy is being Christ's person right where he or she is, in the marketplace or the home, every moment of every day. This is part of the everyday business of holiness.&quot;<br />This is a book of depth that will help you grow in spiriual maturity. It is based on solid Bible teachings which can be summed up in love. Love God; love people.	2003-11-05

Due to the complexity, prediction is elusive, but one can view organizations in a structured way even in the midst of change.<br />Five chapters are found in this overview. The book begins with the anatomy of organizations and ends with a discussion on limitations, problems associated with making predictions.<br />Reading a book that was written decades before the field expanded is useful because it helps to see how thinking on the topic has evolved. I recommend this book because it provides a history of the study of organization changes and many of its points are still valid.	2003-11-05

In practical ways it shows how to overcome anxiety and worry.<br />She writes, &quot;If we wait until everything is perfect before rejoicing and giving thanks, we won't have much fun. Learning to enjoy life even in the midst of circumstances is one way we develop spiritual maturity.&quot; She adds that we need to learn to be glad in the Lord Jesus every day along the way in life to our goals. Enjoy the process.<br />Added to this is the fact that God wants us to rejoice in His presence, not His presents she tells us. A lot of attention is devoted to focusing on the appropriate matters, i.e., God and His goodness as opposed to problems.<br />On God's involvement in our lives, she writes, &quot;But when God starts something, He carries it through to completion without any struggle on our part.&quot; Similiarly she notes that if God is not in something it will not work out right. She says our &quot;work&quot; is to believe God.<br />This is a powerful book because it is true and practical. It teaches you how to apply the truths of God's Word to your daily life. Read it and benefit from it.	2003-11-04

He begins with a little background on the matter and goes forward from there. He doesn't really start in ancient times or even early American times with his background discussion, but rather chooses to start in the early 20th century and enter the fray at that point.<br />He talks about the Newspaper Preservation Act which allowed competing newspapers to sharve physical plant resources so that both might survive. As newer forms of media became widespread, newspapers' existence was threatened. This is espicially true of the advertising dollars television lured away. Newspapers survived, as did magazines and other forms of print. In terms of advertising influence on content, he reports that according to editors who were surveyed &quot;more than 70 percent of the editors reported that advertisers 'tried to kill' stories at their paper.&quot;<br />Gatekeeping is also mentioned. In terms of who gains access to media, it was often the case that businesses who advertised with the news organization were the ones interviewed for news stories. Something positive for consumers is that editors of cosumer magazines were morely likely to turn down requests to please advertisers than their colleagues at other news organizations.<br />There are some good background studies in this book. In other places some of the conclusions are pretty self-evident, i.e., common sense validates their reality.	2003-11-04

It is acheived by thinking the proper thoughts. As active participants we can consciously take control of our thoughts. We do not have to passively receive thoughts that randomly come to our minds.<br />Other people benefit when we are in a more positive frame of mind. People who feel negative about themselves usually do NOT positively reinforce other people. As a result, a win for the individual is a win for other people.<br />There's some technical language in this book, but the terms are clearly defined and any reader would not be lost in the explanation.<br />Self-fulfilling prophecy is something we hear a lot about. Its helpful to have this phenomenon addressed in this book. Even though we all basically have a working knowledge of it, it's pertinent to the central theme of this book. A person unconsciously sets up circumstances to confirm what he or she believes will occur. A script exists in the persons mind and they see people to play the roles for the characters in the plot.<br />In the section on living in the now, fresh insight is expressed on how to relish life free from the distractions of the past or unneccesary concerns about the future.<br />A life defining question is posed: &quot;What do you get out of what you are doing?&quot; In addressing this issue he asks you to notice how you're spending your time and energy, two valuable assets. What kind of a return are you getting on your investments?<br />This book helps you to reflect on who you are, where you're going, and what your life is about.	2003-11-03

It is from that perspective that he teaches readers success principles from the Bible. He talks about positioning oneself for a miracle from God. Having the right attitude is part of that positioning.<br />Three keys for the expectation of something better are given: trust, give, expect. We're reminded of the truth, &quot;your job is not your source of supply, God is.&quot; Psalms 75:6-7 is cited, &quot;for promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. But God is the judge.&quot; He writes that belief is measured by action. In working as unto God, we look to Him to do what is best in our lives. &quot;Act on what you believe and watch your doubts resolve themselves,&quot; he tells us.<br />He encourages us by faith to act like the person we're seeking to become. As we think so are we. See yourself internally as you would like to be and the outward actions will be manifested in daily life.<br />Our thinking as the power to make us miserable or set us free. Thoughts significantly influence the quality of life. This book helps you to maintain focus on the positive things of God.	2003-11-03

It is a history of that city and being on location provided a visual element that not everyone can enjoy unless they make the trip.<br />This book is somewhat straightforward as a historical work. It isn't necessarily colorful or instructive. It's just there. Cable describes the setting, the people, the controveries surrrounding a given location and time.<br />If you want to know more about the people who developed the city of New Orleans and how it resulted in some of the mindset there today, this book may provide some answers.	2003-11-03

With equipment dropping in price, more sophisticated equipment is available to more people. While the technology changes some of the elements of producing a show, other features of the process remain the same. In this well-written book, Professor Fielding covers the basics quite thoroughly.<br />In the opening chapter, a definition of television production is given and expanded upon. The medium is a communication tool and to be used effectively one must know what it can and cannot do. Television distorts reality, effective producers alter it for the desired effect.<br />This book introduces readers to the key terms and procedures. I consider it to be an asset that it is smaller than other TV production books. Readers are not burdened with information overload.	2003-11-01

The author talks about observing the animals in action for herself and discovering  that &quot;their motion was one of the most beautiful examples of exultant and apparently effortless ease in surmounting obstacles which I have ever seen.&quot; The reference to hind's feet is also found in Psalms 18:33.<br />The first chapter starts with an invitation to the high places. It is in the concluding few chapters that she reconnects back to the book's primary theme. Numerous Christians have been encouraged by this book and chances are you will be too.	2003-11-01

Faith is an essential element of God's working with human beings. Dr. Schuller makes an insightful observation on faith, without using the word itself. He says, &quot;God gave us dreams and dreams are always impossible, if they come from God.&quot; Wow! That means miracles are necessary. It further means that unless God intervenes the dream will not come to fruitition. This is a way of testing the dream to see if it is truly from God.<br />Overcoming obstacles is a part of the process of any worthwhile venture. There's good news in that regard. He reminds us, &quot;Every problem has a life span.&quot; In other words, it will come to an end. It will not continue indefinitely. Consider the benefit of being engaged in overcoming the problem. &quot;Every frustration has the potential to make you into something,&quot; is the nugget of truth he shares on that issue.<br />The book constantly talks about listening to God and being directed by Him. He talks about God working in the midst of difficulties, and how those hard times are purposeful in the lives of Christians. Consider his statement that, &quot;Power, success, and achievement will come to you anywhere you are if your attitude is right.&quot;<br />Since I love California, I like what he put in the book about its radiance, &quot;...in no other place in the world do the stars shine brighter than over the deserts of California.&quot;<br />In reassuring us of God's guidance in our lives, he emphasizes proper perspective. He writes, &quot;Focus your thoughts on God; don't focus them on your problem.&quot;<br />This book is part of the faith-building section of my library. Re-reading it and reviewing the underlined parts and the notes I've written in the margins inspires me every time I do so.	2003-11-01

A true seeker, one who wants to discover meaning and purpose goes to the Creator to discover specific direction. He admonishes us to focus on what is possible, not on obstacles, adding, that problems are actually possibilities in disguise.<br />Sales professionals can really appreciate the novel way he defines their field of endeavor. He says, &quot;Successful selling is nothing more than communicating to people a truth they weren't aware of before.&quot; Imagine the implications. The person is trying to improve the potential client's life. That reality should lessen stress.<br />Overcomers are reminded that every successful person, regardless of the arena in which he or she worked faced failure at some point. Success if the process of working through failure. Persistence is essential in doing so. Every expert was once an amateur. Every possibility thinker is an adventurer. Dr. Schuller get me excited. He is inspiring, a true motivator.<br />He brings a clear awareness of the Bible verse, as a man thinketh in his heart so is he, but writing, &quot;Your self-concept is the core of your personality.&quot; Another truth from the Bible of which we're reminded is that God plans and guides the circumstances and events in our lives long before we become aware of what's going on.<br />One of the reasons I find his books, including this one, so practical is because he clearly shows how to apply teachings from the Bible in one's daily life. Dreams is a common topic he addresses and this book includes some very pertinent comments on dreams. He says, &quot;The size of your faith in God alone will set the ceilings and boundaries to your dream.&quot; Couple dreaming and praying. Mull your dreams over with God. Listen. Test. Think. Seek. Read. Pray some more.	2003-11-01

The &quot;impossible&quot; (with man) dream became possible because of the miraculous interventions of God. The details are given in this account. The author tell us, &quot;It was a God-given vision, and He would put the wheels in motion Himself.&quot;<br />The balanced perspective his wife brought to the table is included. He describes her as being a pragmatist. We're told, &quot;She became the economist of the family, the realist, the pragmatist. She didn't need to be a dreamer because she married one.&quot; He adds, &quot;I was fifty-two years old, with no experience whatsoever in television.&quot; Carr tells us that a ministry born in faith and sustained in faith must progress in faith also.<br />Writing further about faith, he says, &quot;By faith we realize the dream, we accept the challenge, we shoulder the burden. By faith we reach beyond our own circle and grasp the impossible.&quot;	2003-11-01

Having established that qualification, I'd say he makes some valid observations in this book that are quite helpful for overcoming negative misconceptions that tend to hold one back.<br />In some places of the book I thought he was diverging from orthodoxy, but when I read his concluding chapter I think it was just a poor choice of building his case. It's in the conclusion that he makes it clear he is talking about God's plans and purposes being dominant in a person's life.<br />Dr. Schuller successfully uses scientific evidence to demonstrate how the ancient truths of the Bible apply to one's thought life.<br />I can't help but mention he wrote this book before the fall of Communism, but his prediction is clear, unambiguous, and now history. He wrote, &quot;I boldly predict that Communism will ultimately fail...&quot; He was right about that and he's right about a lot of other things in this book.	2003-11-01

That is a wise word for the study that follows. He presents a prayer clock, broken down into segments. It isn't meant to be rigidly followed, but serve as a guide to be alterated as appropriate.<br />He starts with priase, adoring God for Who He is and for what He has done. The prayer of Jesus, the Lord's prayer is the model for this type of prayer. It is in this act that we shift the emphasis from self to God.<br />The second segment looks at waiting on God in silent reverence. He cites historical examples of people of action, who had cultivated this art masterfully.<br />He continues with confession, praying the Scriptures, watching, intercession, and so on. Reading this book can help you &quot;love the Lord your God will all your mind.&quot; It increases prayer effectiveness by enhancing your spiritual awareness.	2003-10-31

The documentation is thorough. His writing style is easy to follow. Fans of Gospel music are indebted to him for compiling the pieces of the puzzle in this volume.<br />In the introduction he defines Gospel music. He breaks it down into various subcategories and describes the differences between them. In the first chapter he goes on to talk about the musical heritage found in the Bible.<br />Chapter two contains a history of early church music. He says church music moved away from the use of instruments for a time because of the association of instruments with pagan rites, the theatre, and the circus.<br />John Calvin and Martin Luther are two sixteenth century figures in the spotlight in chapter 3. Their theology that an individual could communicate with God had ramifications for Christian music. Chapter four discusses Luther as a songwriter. In chapter five we arrive on American soil and the story continues as we're told of the first seeds of Gospel music in this country.<br />This book is full of anecdotes of well-known personalities and the audiences they sought to reach. It provides coverage of a niche that has frequently been overlooked. Thanks to Dr. Cusic and other researchers it is now gaining attention.	2003-10-31

In this introductory text, the authors attempt this difficult challenge. They explain, &quot;In short, this book has to do with the interpretation of statistical techniques.&quot; It is explained that for numbers to have significance, they must be interpreted.<br />Three classifications are presented in an overview study of this nature: 1) descriptive statistics 2) statistical inference, and 3) prediction or regression. Each of these three categories are included in this book.<br />There are 19 chapters covering the topics one would expect to be found in such a book. While the opening chapter begins with a background and introduction, the concluding chapter deals with sampling-error theory for simple linear regression. In between there are subjects such as; frequency distribution, percentile ranks, symbolic representation of data, and so on.	2003-10-31

He writes, &quot;...people who give admiration and affection get them back--if what they give is spontaneous and sincere. People are irresistibly drawn to 'warm' people.&quot;<br />He describes an interview he had with Rudyard Kipling. The famous author told Gordon, &quot;Do the things you really want to do if you possibly can. Don't wait for circumstances to be exactly right. You'll find they never are.&quot;<br />Mysteries are explored in this reflective collection. Intuition, the unsolved, and similar musings. Life is celebrated! We're told &quot;there are two types of human beings: those who think of life as a privilege and those who think of it as a problem.&quot;<br />Consider this poignant observation he makes on purpose, &quot;The worst that can happen to any creature is to be made incapable of doing the thing it was created to do.&quot;<br />Perhaps the most famous Arthur Gordon quote is included in this book. It's one I've heard Guidepost writer and editor Fred Bauer use: &quot;Be bold--and mighty forces will come to your aid.&quot;<br />This is an awesome book. Its contents are powerful. I highly recommend it. The quality of your life will be enhanced as you become aware of the positive perceptions that exist beyond the sometimes cloudy temporal state of affairs.	2003-10-31

This book answers that question by providing historical glimpses of the past. It is edited so that &quot;competing research viewpoints&quot; are expressed (as stated in the introduction). Many of the contributions first appeared in academic journals and are reprinted in this compilation.<br />Part one begins with a look at early American audiences. It starts with a piece by David D. Hall on print and the collective mentality in seventeenth-century New England.<br />A total of seven sections of the book break the subject matter down into manageable parts. They do not have to be read in order for one to learn more about any given subject.<br />This is a valuable contribution to the history of media in the United States. It shows how we arrived at our present state of excessive amounts of media availability to large segments of the population. While doing so, it reminds us of what it was like in earlier times when media were in the developmental stages and was not readily available.	2003-10-31

It's a snapshot, covering a given time frame. Some observers believe one can get a more objective view if they are removed from a given culture. His foreword was written in Islamabad, thus, he possibily achieved some of the desired objectivity such observers desire.<br />Chapter one starts with advertising, in particular, the well-known advertising campaign of the Marlboro Man (as in cigarettes). Chapter two looks at the ups and downs of celebrites, Bert Bacharach is the focus here. Chapters three and four view gasoline stations and hamburger stands respectively. The remaining chapters examine other segments of popular culture.<br />The afterword makes an argument for the study of popular culture. It is considered by the author to be a social utility. As one views popular culture, a window on perception is exposed.	2003-10-31

It starts with a definition of the field and ends with a discussion on the management of change.<br />In seeking to define the field, a bit of caution is given. He writes, &quot;Rather than providing 'the one perfect solution' to a problem, this book offers guidance from the OB field to help you learn how to find a good answer for each situation.&quot;<br />Inserts from professionals add another dimension to the content. Their comments are quite helpful.<br />Part two of the book addresses the issue of how attitudes are formed. The process is gradual and personal. Social learning takes place on the job. Individuals learn how things are &quot;really&quot; done as contrasted with official publications.<br />There are charts and graphs along with other visuals throughout the book to assist in one's understanding. The writing is clear. Anyone seeking to learn about organizational behavior would benefit from reading this book.	2003-10-31

We're reminded that as Christians, God is with us and &quot;There is power in His presence.&quot; God is active in the lives of believers. He told us He would be. &quot;Ability, talents, opportunity, material resources are really not ours. They are God's investments in us. And like any wise investor, God expects dividends,&quot; the author tell us. What He expects, we're told, for one thing, is to serve others. Bernard Shaw is quoted as saying, &quot;A gentleman is one who puts more into life than he takes out.&quot;<br />The next time you're unjustly criticized, consider what he says about the source of such comments. &quot;It is a sure sign of an inferiority complex when a person tells of the faults of another.&quot;<br />On significance, he tells us that no one was born apart from the will of God, that we existed in the mind of God before we were physically formed in the womb.<br />Faith is a necessary component of the Christian life. William Carey is quoted from a sermon he gave in 1992, &quot;Expect great things from God, attempt great things for God.&quot;<br />Examples of Jesus meeting practical daily needs are presented. The author couples this with inner longings and desires and writes, &quot;...He (Jesus) knows we have desires and wants beyond our bare necessities. We are not wild beasts.&quot;<br />Near the conclusion he has a quote worth pondering. It helps a person see beyond self. Allen writes, &quot;No person ever really lives until he has found something worth dying for.&quot;<br />This book will improve you life. It will help you to connect with everlasting realities. Its truths will transform your perceptions. You thoughts will be healthy as you medidate on its precepts.	2003-10-31

Mircea Eliade left his thoughts with us. This section of his journal covers the years 1979-1985. It was a time he was active as a scholar. His description of the sorts of things I relate to, such as reading, acquiring books, writing, preparing presentations and such sort of reinforce the work. I see it as a continuation in a sense. Scholarly pursuits continue from one person to another, from one generation to another. That is not to say I agree with him. It is simply to say I identify with the arena in which he worked. In fact, agreement on issues is not what I am talking about here.<br />If you are like me and enjoy reading the intimate thoughts of a writer/researcher/inquirer then you will like this book.	2003-10-31

He places his recommendations in a list of 12 rules that are easy to follow. Don't limit yourself to the list however, this book is meant to be enjoyed. Read the whole thing.<br />He tells us from the beginning he's approaching his subject from a Christian perspective. He offers hope for anyone seeking to motivate other people, pointing out, \\"Motivators are not born--they are made.\\" He argues that the predisposition already exists for potential motivators, that people do not want to be lethargic and bored, they want to be challenged. He phrases it nicely when he writes, \\"deep in the breast of everyone there is a drive to achieve something, to be somebody.\\"<br />McGinnis makes an insight observation on listening. He says if you listen to people long enough they will tell you what motivates them.<br />He includes a lot about encouragement and creating the proper environment in an organization. That means leaving room for failure, because as risks are taken, sometimes failure will result. Failure is temporary.<br />Near the end, McGinnis has a powerful section on dreamers, leaders, and the solitary lifestyle such individuals often have. The book builds to this crescendo. A quote from Goethe sets the tone, \\"Whatever you dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.\\"<br />This book will help you gain a greater focus if you read it and follow what it suggests. Your communication skills with other people will be enhanced. Other people will respect you more as you learn to relate to them more effectively.	2003-10-31

The chapters are taken in order and explained in an expository manner. Dr. Wiersbe reminds us that God is &quot;working in us to accomplish His purposes.&quot; He elaborates by emphasizing that the One Who is working is &quot;the God of providence who guided this universe to its divinely ordained destiny.&quot;<br />Key words are traced back to the original language in this study. For example, in Hebrews 2:10-13 where Jesus is described as being the Captain of salvation, we're told another word for Captain could be pioneer, as in one who opens the way for others to follow.<br />Jesus Christ is the theme of the book of Hebrews. This book explains the various parts of the book, such as Jesus being superior to angels, Moses, and Aaron. Consequently, Christians have a better covenant than the old one.<br />This is a well-researched book that is easy to read. It covers the book of Hebrews thoroughly. I strongly recommend it.	2003-10-31

He offers insights on how to do so as he teaches the principles practiced by achievers. From a Christian perspective, he teaches one how to live life to the fullest.<br />There are 49 chapters so the reading can be broken down into manageable segments. These ideas were practiced by Dr. Morgan, who was dean of liberal arts at the University of Louisiana in Monroe. He was also a popular speaker for various civic and religious organizations.<br />Although he is a scholar, Dr. Morgan had the ability to communicate effectively with audiences from virtually any background. This book is written to be understood by the general public. It is very easy to follow. I highly recommend it. The examples he uses demonstrate how the principles have worked in the lives of other people.	2003-10-30

It describes how colleges and universities entered the arena academically. Various management theories are also described. The second chapter covers the theories more thoroughly. Documentation throughout the book is extensive.<br />Ethical responsibilities to other people and God is clearly spelled out. They write, &quot;This sense of ethics or morality may derive from institutional religious commitment or from a self-understanding of man's respect for and responsibility to fellow men under God. In order to help others in society develop fully as individual persons. Such integrity goes far beyond mere personal piety or scattered efforts at 'good works'; it is the fabric of a man's life.&quot;<br />They go so far as to say that &quot;The most effective managers do not permit material considerations to dominate their existence.&quot; So many managers in media organizations need to buy into that liberating statement.<br />Time management, programming concerns, and the other expected topics for a book of this nature are covered. While the legal section is outdated, it is still useful to read for historical perspective. Managers should know the history of their profession.<br />I strongly recommend this book. It remains a valuable asset to any media manager's library. It informs, instructs, illuminates, and even inspires to a degree. The message brought by these two authors still rings true in the media marketplace today.heir profession.<br />I strongly recommend this book.

Former president Gerald R. Ford, along with Peter L. Berger, Peter F. Drucker, James Reston, Michael Novak, and many others are added to the mix.<br />There is an insightful quote from Agatha Christie's autobiography included where she writes: &quot;One does feel proud to belong to the human race when one sees the wonderful things human beings have fashioned with their hands. They have been creators--they must share a little the holiness of the Creator, who made the world and all that was in it, and saw that it was good. But He left more to be made. He left the things to be fashioned by men's hands. He left them to fashion them, to follow in his footsteps because they were made in his image, to see what they made, and see that it was good . . . &quot;<br />Novak has a poignant oberservation on the media:<br />&quot;What's wrong is that we hardly ever find ourselves reflected in 'popular culture,' the culture of the media, the culture most of us are forced to live on because there isn't much else that reaches all of us at the same time. When was the last time on television...you saw your own neighborhood, or saw your own values lived out. I often want to tell my children, with reference to the celebrity culture which seems so far from everything we stand for, 'Celebrities are nice people...but I wouldn't want you to marry one.' Celebrities of the media represent a world of values foreign to everything we want to stand for.&quot;<br />Marty Martin has a particularly inspiring contribution on creativity toward the end of the book. There some nuggets scattered throughout that are worth attention. Overall the book has some valuable statements worth considering.	2003-10-30

That's the adventure taken by Francis and Edith Schaeffer and this book chronicles the process.<br />It is well-written. As the story line unfolds, you are captivated by what will happen next.<br />Numerous answers to prayer are included in the adventure.<br />Also, how often have we related to the statement she writes that, &quot;The thing about real life is that important events don't announce themselves...Usually something that is going to change your whole life is a memory before you can stop and be impressed about it. You don't usually have a chance to get excited about that sort of thing...ahead of time!&quot;<br />By the way, L'Abri is French for &quot;The Shelter.&quot;<br />There are so many answers to prayer in this story that one's faith is built as the direct communication of God to His people is described in a clear way.<br />Edith Schaeffer writes, &quot;...it has been tremendously excited to see the reality of communication with God, and to see the reality of His replies, His answers, in the realm of material things, and in the realm of the minds and hearts of human beings.&quot;<br />The Schaeffer's had a unique, &quot;world-class&quot; ministry at L'Abri.

As people are ever changing, so are the social systems of which they are a part. Boulding views these changes from a long term perspective in this book. The future of complex systems cannot be accurately forecast because there are so many unpredictable variables associated with potential outcomes.<br />Karl Marx's theories proved to be absolutely wrong in light of history. &quot;The successful capitalist societies have followed an entirely different course from that which Marx predicted,&quot; Boulding tells us. Marx and Engels were both were both radical atheists. In the former Soviet Union, &quot;real wages have been held down or even have declined over long periods, and it took nearly thirty years after the revolution for them to get back to the 1913 pre-revoluationary period,&quot; statistics indicate. Marx's theories on the nature of humanity were totally wrong too.<br />This books presents a unique interpreation on the dynamics of international interactions from a social systems perspective.	2003-10-29

Issues, options, potential problems, and the potential associated with the use of computers in research are discussed at length. Lee and Fielding, two UK researchers (and the book's editors) cover the subject matter quite well.<br />In fact, the vast majority of contributors to this book are UK based. A minority of American researchers are included, however.<br />In the second chapter, Renata Tesch (USA) discusses software and looks at program capabilities.<br />Paradigms and research processes in the transformation of qualitative methodology is the issue discussed in chapter 3 by Lyn Richards and Tom Richards.<br />They make the point, &quot;Qualitative method is about understanding data in their context.&quot;<br />John Davies has a chapter on automated tools for qualitative research.<br />His chapter is heavily illustrated to clarify his points.<br />The three chapters in part two (chapters 5-7) talk about the implications for research practice.<br />The third part of the book (chapters 8-11) provide closure in addressing qualitative knowledge and computing.<br />This is a nice contribution to the niche it seeks to fill.	2003-10-29

In the first section of the book, Smiley Blanton opens with a discussion of the power of an invisible force, a force that can change tangible circumstances and realities, the force of faith. This sets the stage for the remaining chapters which go further in developing the theme of how to tap into this rich resource. Norman Vincent Peale builds upon this introduction by explaining more about the Bible verse, &quot;as he thinket in his heart, so is he.&quot; He talks about the implications this has for taping the hidden, often overlooked resources of the subconscious mind. Dr. Peale notes, &quot;the unconscious can only send back what was first sent down.&quot;<br />Thoughts are the seeds of deeds. We're told &quot;Before every deed there is a thought or more properly a succession of thoughts.&quot;<br />In the third chapter, Smile Blanton tells how to overcome fear, worry, and anxiety.<br />Dr. Peale reminds us that when we get our minds on God, we get our minds off our selves and as a result our confidence in Him provides a release from the negative emotions that try to hold us bound.<br />As one submits to God's care his or her future, the assurance comes that God knows what is best and His will will be accomplished as it is accepted by faith. We're encouraged to saturate our minds with the thought that God can be trusted with our futures, that He has our best interest in mind.<br />&quot;The relaxed man is the powerful man,&quot; Dr. Peale tells us. Such a person has confidence in God, not self. He is not bound by rigidity. He is flexible for the inevitable changes life brings.<br />Guilt is addressed in the next chapter. Readers struggle with that emotion should read this section carefully and prayerfully.<br />Similarly the next section goes on to talk about self-criticism, failure, and success. We're reminded that change is always occurring. The insight is given that the Bible does not urge us to &quot;try harder&quot; but to &quot;believe.&quot;<br />The rest of the book deals with other challenges one faces in life. My copy is well-marked, highlighted, with notes in the margin. I strongly recommend this book.

He helps one to see the big picture both chronologically and globally. Take for example his opening observation that &quot;While America's new information economy is our most important megatrend, it is only part of the puzzle.&quot; He logically argues that &quot;collectively what is going on locally is what is going on in America.&quot; The five bellwether states, which set the trends for the rest of the couutry are idenified as; California, Florida, Washington, Colorado, and Connecticut.<br />A strong case is made in the second chapter for &quot;high touch&quot; (i.e., human involvement) to remain a vital component of the high tech age.<br />In the third chapter, the global economy is described. The airplane and satellite communication are identified as the technologies that caused the transition from a national to a global economy.<br />Although an international, global economy exists, surprisingly at the same time decentralization is occurring. He explains in chapter 5 why.<br />In the following chapter he similarly explains how people are becoming increasinly proactive in their individual futures, and not rely on institutional help.<br />The proactive theme is carried a step further in chapter seven.<br />Chapter 8 discusses the phenomenon of networking.<br />Right up to the end of his book, he makes a solid case for the trends he describes. This is a well-written book, researched so that its essential theme remains accurate although a lot has changed since it originally was published.	2003-10-29

Edison that sums up the whole message of this book, &quot;If we were to do all we are capable of doing we would literally astonish ourselves.&quot; It is with that spirit that Dr. Peale presents more evidence that one's thoughts determine one's destiny. A master at teaching people to apply Christian faith in everyday life, Dr. Peale has made another strong case for faith-based living.<br />In the preface he writes, &quot;think positively, act positively, image positively, pray positively, and believe positively, and powerful results will be yours.&quot;<br />The first chapter describes the excitement of the process of adventurous, positive achievement. The fact that it is an ongoing process means the excitement need never end. Success feeds success.<br />He lists four factors which make up the process of success: 1)goal setting 2) positive thinking 3) visualizing and 4)believing.<br />He continues to emphasize that God is the essence of one's success, that one cannot achieve without Him.<br />Dr. Peale has a gift for putting powerful truths in memorable phrases, such as, &quot;Belief power gets powerful results.&quot;<br />In the third chapter he talks about problem solving and reminds us that &quot;every problem contains the seeds of its own solution.&quot;<br />Guidance from God, like other gifts from Him, is received by faith. He says believe that and act accordingly.<br />Like attracts like. He advocates applying that principle to one's thoughts. Positive thoughts attract similar thoughts.<br />Read this powerful book to enhance the quality of your life. You can't go wrong by doing so.	2003-10-29

This book seeks to answer that question by looking at long term trends and assumptions of workers that has resulted in societal changes in this country.<br />Work has broader ramifications than one might initially think. We're told &quot;For better or worse, our work defines us.&quot; They go on to make the argument successfully for this statement. Work has a &quot;purposeful nature&quot; they write and add that &quot;meaningful work is a fundamental dimension of human existence, an expression of our very nature.&quot;<br />Consequently, by talking about the work ethic of the United States, they're talking about larger issues, issues that pertain to who we are.<br />Included in this book are some particularly interesting historical asides. For example, Johann Sebastian Bach inscribed &quot;SDG&quot; on his compositions, meaning &quot;Sola Deo Gloria&quot; (to the glory of God alone).<br />The work ethic of the nation's founders was based on Christian teachings. &quot;To ignore the religious roots of the work ethic is to ignore the clear evidence of history,&quot; they write.<br />Work requires effort. Obtaining an education is work. &quot;Knowledge is not acquired by osmosis, but by discipline and hard work,&quot; we're reminded.<br />Not only did I find this book to be informative, but I was inspired by it. Working for an audience of One. Doing work as unto God, as the Bible teaches adds a dimension that can find significance no where else. The Reformation brought this realization back to the attention of workers. No job is insignificant if done as unto Him. That's the message of this book.	2003-10-29

He adds, those who seem to produce and perpetuate problems should be avoided. &quot;Live your life as most people do and you will be forced to settle for what most people settle for,&quot; he writes. Anyone wanting a different outcome, must obviously do things differently. In this book, he tells what he thinks those things should be.<br />He offers sound advice in telling his readers to drop the emotional baggage of the past. The focus is to be on the future. One's past experiences can be a limiting factor.<br />We're reminded throughout this book that in order to experience results unknown, we will have to do what we have never done.<br />Action is another theme that is repeated and with good reason.<br />He has dreams included in his discussion of planning. He writes, &quot;Think of your Dreams as the script for a movie about your life.&quot;<br />His chapter (6) on goal setting is helpful. To the cliche-driven people who talk about &quot;paying their dues&quot; he says &quot;You end up achieving in life because of planning and control, not because you have 'paid your dues'.&quot;<br />Goals are compared to signposts in that they are indicators one is on the road to fulfilling one's dreams.<br />I totally disagree with the fact that he jumped out of a plane as a sign of &quot;conquering&quot; his fear. In the margin I wrote &quot;This is plain foolish.&quot; If one logically follows, why not go face-to-face with a lion, drink poison, stand out in sub zero weather for extended periods of time. The list is endless of foolish things one could do.<br />Another weakness in the book is the fact that the spiritual dimension is ignored.<br />Otherwise there is some helpful advice in most of the book.	2003-10-29

It is all inclusive in that it includes social, spiritual, and family aspects in addition to work. Covey says he became interested in how perceptions influenced the actions of people. The seven habits grows out of this internal worldview, i.e., that people act based on what they think. Habits are powerful forces. Some are by default, but this book instructs readers in how to control the habits that will determine their destines.<br />Developing relationships with other people is a vital issue he addresses in this discussion. He talks about gaining personal, private victory before one advances to public, recognizable accomplishment.<br />There is a lot of solid, insightful, practical wisdom in this well-written book. I highly recommend it as it will improve your thought life and help you to focus on doing things based on significance, not just arbitrarily exist.	2003-10-28

She spends several pages talking about divine appointments. God's timing is also included in the explanation given. She notes, &quot;God has a preset time for you to arrive at this place&quot; (p. 36).<br />The season of preparation is describe. Again, she uses David to illustrate that he experienced certain victories before he encountered and overcame Goliath.<br />On promotion she writes, &quot;Stop trying to promote yourself.

He writes, &quot;On radio and TV, your air of decisiveness (style/delivery) is as important as your substance (content/words). Be friendly, be brief, be direct, and be positive.&quot;<br />Commitment is often the missing ingredient in effectively conveying your message to other people.

Fortunate for us that their legacy is still available, as we're richer for it.<br />Peter was Chaplain of the U.S. Senate, a position he had not sought. He was a Scottish immigrant to this country. This book describes how God orchestrated the circumstances that led to a life of accomplishment from an eternally significant perspective.<br />On page 15 she tells us, &quot;Peter Marshall did not grow up wanting to be a minister. That was God's idea--not his.&quot; She says often God has to shut a door in order for us to go through the door he wants us to go through.<br />Eric Liddell was a significant influence in Peter's younger years. He was the Scottish olympian who was more committed to Jesus than to winning international acclaim.<br />I underlined what was said about dreams in the part of the book on Peter's early years. &quot;I learned that just because God loves us so much, often He guides us by planting His own lovely dream in the barren soil of a human heart,&quot; she notes. Later on she adds that if the dreams are really of God, even though they may be carried a long time, they often suddenly become reality.<br />I also love what the way she describes the book-lined place Peter inhabited. &quot;Books lined one wall--good books--inspiring and instructive--good books--good friends.&quot;<br />One of several idiosyncrasies I share with Peter Marshall is that we're both &quot;night owls.&quot; She says he was usually his best and brightest around midnight.<br />Throughout this book on her late husband, Catherine puts her thoughts into a reflective framework. She talks about Jesus and living life with the long view in mind. Along those lines she talks about Jesus, noting that he never refused anyone who came to Him for help. She says even if we lack faith, we can ask Him for it because faith is a gift of God.<br />She modifies the phrase which is so commonly cited, &quot;God helps those who help themselves,&quot; by writing that actually, &quot;God helps those who trust Him to solve their problems.&quot;<br />This is a well-researched, well-written, inspiring, faith-building, positive book that will make you a better person from having read it.se who help themselves,&quot; by writing that actually, &quot;God helps those who trust Him to solve their problems.&quot;<BR>This is a well-researched, well-written, inspiring, faith-building, positive book that will make you a better person from having read it.	2003-10-28

The truth sets you free from depression, guilty, confusion, and anxiety. This book shows you how to replace self-defeating thoughts with healthy thoughts that build you up. It is based on principles from the Bible.<br />We're told early in the book, &quot;you'll believe what you tell yourself&quot; (p. 18). Consequently it is important not to be decieved. Self-deception can hold a person back from living the abundant life Jesus sacrificed to give us.<br />In laying the background for the rest of the book, he tells us on page 21:<br />&quot;In emotional and mental health, what you believe is all important. It makes a difference what you believe. Other people, circumstances, events and material things are not what make you happy. What you believe about these things is what makes you happy or unhappy.&quot;<br />Actions grow out of beliefs. You will behave, based on what you believe. In fact, the chemicals in the physcial brain are affected by the thoughts one thinks.<br />Chapter 3 does a masterful job of explaining how negative thoughts are deceptive. In the chapter's summary, he writes, &quot;Remember, any thoughts that reflect hopelessness, desperation, hate, fear, bitterness, jealousy, or envy are the words and thoughts generated by demonic falsehood&quot; (p. 35).<br />Chapter 5 contains a nugget on effective prayer, &quot;Instead of praying the problem, pray the answer&quot; (p. 61).<br />The book takes a negativity and exaimes how it is a deception. For example, anger or fear. As a person realizes the truth, the negative is replaced with the positive.<br />Read this book and grow healthy mentally.	2003-10-27

Four approaches to social research are covered in this book: experimentation, survey research, field research, and the use of available data.<br />In the beginning of the book the argument is made for the book's primary subject, i.e., the question of why study research methods is addressed.<br />From this introduction a segue is made into the nature of science and the logical foundations of social research in particular.<br />After this section, there follows a discussion on research design and the elements which are found therein.<br />In the third section of the book, one finds a discussion of the methods of data collection.<br />As would be expected, this is followed by a discussion of interpreting the results and presenting the findings.<br />This is an effective book on how to go about conducting social research.

The entire message of the book is summarized on page 8, where he writes &quot;...there is a sequence of success for each project and for each area of your life. These sequences frequently overlap from one area to the next.&quot; Timing is seen as something over which the individual has a degree of control. Success if viewed as a process rather than a product. He notes &quot;...success is a way of traveling, not a destination&quot; (p. 9).<br />The four seasons; winter, spring, summer, and autumn serve as the demarcation points in this book.<br />I love his description of dreams. He tells us &quot;Dreams and goals are previews of coming attractions in your life&quot; (p. 12).<br />Dreams of young children are not to be taken lightly. He observes &quot;In many cases, childhood dreams hold the key the a person's true cache of talents, abilities, and motivation&quot; (p. 36).<br />His discussion of goal-setting and attainment is worth special consideration. He advises, &quot;From this point forward, choose to do only the things that bring you closer to your goals&quot; (p. 59).<br />As part of enjoying the process toward achieving significant goals, he says reward yourself along the way for intermediate goals as they're accomplished. That's solid reasoning that helps one maintain morale as the pursuit continues.<br />He quotes Bob Smullin as saying he never met a man or woman with a clear focus who ever had a time management problem. Consequently, a person who doesn't know how to prioritize is one who lacks focus.<br />Dr. Waitley says annual goals should be broken down into quarterly goals, then further broken down into smaller units.<br />He makes an observation that I've seen in students as I've observed some with productive habits and others  who seemed to live by default, being victims of circumstance. He writes &quot;It takes just as much effort to lead a bad life as it does to lead a good one&quot; (p. 119).<br />Consider this powerful quote from him on living well daily, &quot;Thus also, day by day, we write our own destiny inexorably like the rings on a tree, we become what we do&quot; (p. 148).<br />Maintaining relationships with the right kind of people is part of the success process.<br />Near the book's conclusion he points out that our success benefits other people. He describes life as a responsibility in that it helps other people.<br />I recommend this book as highly as I can.

I was so pleased to discover his love of books in the preface. I agree with him &quot;Books are my friends.&quot; I agree with him even more, when further down the same page he writes, &quot;Jesus is my source, my resource, and my goal.&quot; The man making these comments is not setting in some ivory tower merely pondering. He is a man of action if ever there was one. Pastor Barnett has made substantial practical changes in the lives of numerous people. On page 34 he talks about people of action. &quot;Visionaries act!&quot; he tells us. Pastor Barnett discusses visions as they relate to God's plans for us. He views success as a lifestyle, writing, &quot;I want to instill in people that after you find a peak, the next vision and dream should be a higher one&quot; (p. 35).<br />On page 80 he has some unique insights on creativity. &quot;God creates through people. Since He dwells in our spirit, we need to spend time feeding that spirit side of the inner man. Let the spirit soar!&quot; he advises.<br />In chapter six he describes the way he prays. He gets a cup of coffee, goes outside near his church and frequently listens to God. Active listening in prayer helps him to tap into God's plans for his life.<br />In the concluding chapters he talks about living your life to bless other people.<br />This is a powerful book, written by a man I greatly admire.

The first chapter discusses the significance of one's thought's in attaining one's dreams.<br />Its message came be summed up in a sentence that is highlighted by the author, \\"Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe it can achieve\\" (p. 32).<br />A logical progression of this initial theme is found in the second chapter as he talks about desire.<br />In the third chapter he writes, \\"The emotions of faith, love, and sex are the most powerful of all the major positive emotions\\" (p. 49). He goes on to describe faith as a \\"state of mind which may be induced, or created, by affirmation or repeated instructions to the subconscious mind, through the principle of autosuggestion\\" (p. 50).<br />He stresses the importance of coupling emotions with desires and thoughts.<br />In stimulating the subconscious mind, he says belief or faith determines the action of the subconscious.<br />Other parts of the book talk about the importance of working well with other people. Leaders encourage, they don't intimidate.<br />Good advice is given when he tells his readers to do an annual review of their lives.<br />His chapter on the \\"master mind\\" is bogus. It's way off base, out in left field.<br />I'm also concerned about the list of nine men who have been most influential in his life. None of those would be on my list, with the exception of perhaps Edison.<br />Taken cautiously, there's some good advice in this book and there is more wheat than chaff in here. Just don't take everything he says. Use discrimination.	2003-10-23

He firmly establishes the theme of the book in this chapter by describing the delight found in communicating with God. He even has some provide things to say about language itself. Several instances of answered prayers are used to illustrate the point being made about prayer being effective.<br />The second chapter opens with a challenge. He encourages readers to seek solitude in the country and listen in prayer. He cites Cornelius in the Bible as one who listened in prayer and as a result received awesome answers from God.<br />This chapter also has a wonderful analogy in describing a baby's early attempts at communicating. He says an earthly father is delighted at the attempts and works with the baby through the early stages of development. He says God is like that in our attemtps at commuicating with Him. He adds that God wants to communicate with us and if we put forth the effort we will we rewarded.<br />In chapter five a strong case is made for the practicality of prayer. He cites a list of people who were achievers, who made a significant difference in their generation who prayed a lot.<br />He advocates praying with an open Bible. This goes along with what other writers have said on this subject.<br />Another familiar theme is found in chapter six, being persistent in prayer. He reminds us that Jesus Himself taught this principle.<br />In chapter seven he reminds us that God wants the best for us so we shouldn't fear His will for our lives.<br />Proverbs instructs us on how to live prosperously. He adds that if God didn't want us to succeed, He wouldn't have included those instructions in the Bible.<br />This book is packed full of insights on the pray life from a man who has the credibility to write such a book.

As an educator he also views things through those lense, noting &quot;...every great leader is clearly teaching--and every great teacher is leading&quot; (p. 23). Coupling both the Christian and the educational components he concludes that &quot;leadership is a relational concept--'the influencing agent and the persons influenced'&quot; (p. 26). Familiarity exposes a leader's humanity. He says through such day to day interaction, illusion is destroyed and a leader is seen as vulnerable with human limitations.<br />Leaders are aware of the competing demands within their organizations.<br />In the second chapter he talks about Jesus knowing how to effectively use power in aiming it toward appropriate results. He goes on to talk about leaders following that example.<br />Chapter three focuses on the Christian leader in carrying out daily tasks by pointing out that the emphasis is on service to God and others, not on what benefits one might attain in a leadership role.<br />In the fourth chapter the burden of leadership is discussed. He reminds readers that Jesus told us to cast our cares upon Him.<br />For leadership to be complete there must be followers. He mentions that early on in the book and devotes chapter five to a more complete investigation of that topic.<br />Chapters six and seven cover unplesant, but essential aspects of leadership, confrontation and forgiveness respectively. In the eighth chapter, planning and perspective are addressed.<br />Nearly every book dealing with this subject contains information on excellence. In this book it is covered in chapter nine.<br />The remaining chapters look at finances and various dimensions of the leader's role such as professional and personal contexts.<br />This is a helpful book.	2003-10-23

It is loaded with solid truths from the Bible. It points out the necessity of standing firm in the midst of difficult circumstances. A fresh perspective is given to help readers see beyond the present and as a result their hopes are built. Consider the quote on page 15, &quot;The most meaningless statistic in a ball game is the score at halftime.&quot; From that observation they go on to describe how every situation involves a process consisting of a beginning, middle and end. They illustrate using several examples from the Bible.<br />They cite medical evidence that hope is a force that &quot;leads to physiological changes that can improve the body's resistance&quot; (p. 31). Hope is viewed as &quot;God's gift to you to keep you healthy and positive and persevering&quot; (p. 33).<br />It really gets exciting on page 36 when they tell us &quot;What is it God created you to do in your life?

This teaching of Jesus Christ, known as the Golden Rule is the starting point of human relations building in this book's discussion on the laws of life. Another principle Jesus taught is found near the conclusion, i.e., that of giving. Templeton writes &quot;Giving makes you a magnet for success&quot; (p. 299).<br />In between these two principles there are numerous other words of advice.<br />On individual growth, Edison is quoted saying &quot;If you are doing anything the way you did twenty years ago, there is a better way&quot; (p. 273).<br />We're reminded of the fact that &quot;success feeds on itself and creates move success&quot; (p. 259).<br />Writing on the quality of life being manifested by one's thoughts, Templeton observes quotes Arnold Patent (p. 251) who noted &quot;What we focus on expands.&quot;<br />A discussion on work being a revelation of one's gift is worth attention. He cites the Latin origin of the word &quot;vocation&quot; as being &quot;to call&quot; and goes on to say that one's work is a person's calling. He encourages readers to find their individual calling.<br />Perception is discussed along with opportunity as he asks readers to ask themselves a question. &quot;As yourself from time to time what you are doing to prepare yourself for success&quot; (p. 175). He adds &quot;Have you trained yourself to recognize opportunity when it knocks?&quot; (p. 175).<br />On page 163 there's an insightful quote from Calvin Coolidge, &quot;no person was ever honored for what he received, but for what he gave.&quot;<br />The books' weakness is that he ties Christianity into all the other religions of the world, ignoring its distinguishing difference. It is the only religion whose leader made the claims He made and whose body has never been discovered by critics who denied the Resurrection.	2003-10-21

In fact, he wrote the forward. The first chapter establishes the theme, &quot;you are responsible for your success: America doesn't owe you a living.&quot; Another familiar thought to readers of Dr. Peale's materials is found in their observation, &quot;We know that whatever the conscious mind accepts as true and chooses to believe, the subconscious will be driven to achieve&quot; (p. 34).<br />A pithy statement on perserverance is made on page 45, &quot;In the end, tenacity, not talent, determines success.&quot;<br />They talk about people who make a significant mark are those who are willing to do what the average person won't do.<br />Like readers of Dr. Robert Schuller, we're reminded to &quot;think in terms of possibilities&quot; (p. 125).<br />They warn, don't let other people impose their limitations on you.<br />Money is a side effect, not the primary goal of achievement oriented people. Purpose is much deeper than financial they say.<br />In the margin I wrote a note to myself to ponder and consider their interpretation of a familiar passage from the Bible. They say, &quot;When the Bible speaks of casting your bread upon the waters, it is referring to the everlasting principle that the more you put into life; the more you get out of it&quot; (p. 127).

He talks about tapping into natural laws that are immutable and consistent to achieve this desired level of living. He makes his point by saying &quot;We can get together and vote against the law of gravity, but our vote wouldn't make one bit of difference&quot; (p. 12). He says whether we agree with these laws or not, they govern our lives. The logically thinking person seeks to discover these laws and apply them.<br />He has a powerful observation on reading. &quot;A man can think no deeper that his vocabulary will allow him to. I read regularly each day...One cannot teach from an empty well&quot; (p. 57).<br />On emotions we're told &quot;Do not waste time on unproductive feelings&quot; (p. 60).<br />He advocates using focus as a means of bringing daily energy to bear on the acheivement of long term goals and dreams.<br />Habit is a power than either we dominate and control or it controls us (p. 124).<br />This is a book to help one reach one's goals by doing things in order of priority.	2003-10-21

In the preface, Elizabeth Sherrill tells us that these notes reflect the author's &quot;daily appointment&quot; with God and were originally kept in spiral-bound notebooks of various shapes and colors. Catherine brought her dreams, goals, desires, and reflections to these times of fellowship with her Creator. Writing eliminated vagueness. We can be thankful that she did not speak in religious cliches, but communicated in a realistic way. She even expresses doubts and areas where she didn't understand what was going on. I find her candor refreshing. She can be trusted. She's not trying to be a &quot;super Christian.&quot; We're told that she liked to pray with her Bible and that &quot;All of Catherine's Bibles are marked with underlinings; color shadings make certain passages almost leap out at you&quot; (p. xxv). Some sections of her Bibles contained question marks in the margins. These observations come from her second husband, Lenoard E. LeSourd in his introduction to the first section of the book.<br />Catherine says &quot;God often speaks to me through dreams&quot; (p. 18). It should be noted that she uses Scripture as the authority whereby these and other sources of information are tested.<br />She discribes memorizing Scripture as a means of it becoming a permanent possession of mind and heart (p. 21).<br />She speaks to people desiring to live above circumstances by saying &quot;...we don't have to settle for blandness in life; God, who is the Author of creativity, is ready to make a dull life adventuresome the moment we allow His Holy Spirit to go work inside us&quot; (p. 49).<br />This wonderful book is full of powerful reflections on the truths of God's Word that can be applied to anyone's life regardless of their position.	2003-10-21

He knowledges that others would disagree with that choice, but goes on to justify his selection by explaining his reasons.<br />The first chapter starts with the Battle of New Orleans. From here the story unfolds with the persona of Andrew Jackson, the hero of that war, who would eventually become president as the transition was made to popular politics and away from elite decision-makers.<br />The Battle of Waterloo, back on the European continent is also described and labeled as &quot;one of the decisive battles of history&quot; (p. 83).<br />The book contains insightful asides such as the one about Talleyrand's love of music. We're told &quot;He hired one of Joseph Haydn's pupils, Sigismond Neukomm, to play the piano softly--background music, hours at a time--while he worked at his desk&quot; (p. 99).<br />Johnson's analysis throughout the book is helpful in placing happenings into an understandable context. For example he talks about the defense of religion given by Francois-Rene de Chateaubriand, saying, &quot;It explained why, as the French themselves had discovered during the atheistic 1790s, religion was a necessary part of human life--and always would be so--why reason and the cold intellect were not enough and why Blaise Pascal had been right to insist that 'the Heart has its reasons which Reason knoweth not'&quot; (p. 111).<br />The anguish of the lack of the heart's desire being met is illustrated in the life of one of the famous composers of the era. &quot;Beethoven's overbearing selfishness was compounded by his failure to marry and the loneliness it bred--'Oh God,' he wrote in anguish, 'may I find her at last, the woman who may strengthen me in virtue, who is permitted to be mine.' But no one was willing to be Beethoven's wife&quot; (p. 122).<br />Johnson contributes greatly to our understanding of this epoch in this well-written and clearly documented book.y documented book.	2003-10-20

He tell us to &quot;supplant destructive thoughts with good ones, diseased thoughts with healthy ones&quot; (p. 32).<br />Another one of his themes that he includes in this book has to do with the power of the mind to create. &quot;There is a deep tendency in human nature to become like that which you image yourself to be&quot; he quotes a psychologist as saying (p. 47).<br />Faith, confident assurance in God, releases powerful help on your behalf.<br />We're reminded of the power of the unseen in his description on page 82, &quot;your life, or mine, is not determined by outward circumstances, but by the thoughts that habitually engage the mind.&quot; As a man thinks so he becomes.<br />He has such a powerful way of expressing truth. Consider the statement he makes on page 84, &quot;A thought, properly employed, possesses a healing property.&quot;<br />If a person wants his life to be different, he should think different thoughts.<br />In a couple of places in the book he reminds us that Jesus Christ taught us to humble ourselves as children.<br />Toward the end of the book, a frank discussion of death is given. I strongly encourage you to get this book, if for no other reason to read this portion of it.<br />What you think determines what you become. What you become determines your life's work. Knowing how to live teaches one how to die.	2003-10-19

We can be assured, however that &quot;The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me&quot; (Psalm 138:8). Dr. Kendall uses the incident of Joseph being sold into slavery, then promoted to ruler to illustrate the mysterious ways of God's &quot;behind the scenes&quot; work.<br />A discussion of dreams is given in the early part of the book. We're reminded that often other people are jealous of those who dream big. Faith is involved in God-given, God-sustained dreams. &quot;The way God often tests our faith is to bring us to places where there is no known precedent&quot; the author tells us (p. 39).<br />An encouraging poing is made about God's timing. We're told He is never too early or too late and that &quot;God can accomplish a lot in a very short period of time&quot; (p. 40).<br />The next point to consider is that trials have significance. They aren't random acts. No matter how senseless they seem, we are to maintain a healthy (positive) attitude during the period of testing.<br />God manifests Himself in the arena of the miraculous. &quot;God wanted to show that what is utterly impossible with man is absolutely possible with God&quot; (p. 56).<br />With Joseph as an example, Dr. Kendall writes, &quot;God had a plan for Joseph that was greater than anything that could be seen at the time&quot; (p. 62).<br />We're reminded &quot;If God wants to put us in a particular place, He can do it...&quot; (p. 71).<br />This book contains numerous truths that encourage, instruct, and edify. Buy it and read it slowly and prayerfully.	2003-10-10

You have to keep on taking it daily, in healthy doses.&quot; He provides a strong dose in this wonderful book. He goes on to describe the importance of having an intense passion for what one does as well as for life in general. He encourages his readers to get outside themselves by getting involved in the lives of other people. A struggle is necessary if one is to become strong he reminds us.<br />He uses the word &quot;intense&quot; to emphasize how vital it is to be fully alive. He couples it with prayer, desire, and belief.<br />One of the common themes found in many of his writings is here again in this book, that being creative visualization.<br />He tells us that things are not what always what they appear to be. Dr. Peale mentions the fact that some things which seem small, can actually be significant events.<br />His chapter on persistence is a strong one.<br />He reassures us that God promises guidance to those who ask Him.<br />There are numerous illustrations of overcoming negative situations, encounters, experiences, and people.

Dr. Peale's gift of encouragement is a powerful one which never grows stale. He knows just how to repeat truths in such a way that the repetition is never boring, but always interesting and pertinent to one's situation in life. Take the first chapter of this excellent book for example. It's about persistence and is appropriately entitled &quot;Keep on Keeping On.&quot; While the theme is familiar, the way he brings the truth out is fresh and creative. In the second chapter he tells us &quot;Positive thinking is realistic thinking&quot; (p. 17). He goes on the say he is basing his information on &quot;the most reliable document ever written,&quot; the Bible. William James is cited, reminding us &quot;Believe and your belief will in time create the fact&quot; (p. 19). Dr. Peale tells us to tap into two awesome powers within us: creative imagination and will. He goes on to tell us that what we believe in our hearts determines what we can or cannot do.<br />The theme of chapter three is love and it is powerfully insightful and practical. We're told &quot;There is not circumstance in your life where God will not stand with you and help you, no matter what it is&quot; (p. 35).<br />The remaining chapters also contain enorously helpful words of wisdom.<br />This is a wonderful book.

He writes, &quot;God does for a fact guide prayerful and believing human beings&quot; (p. 120).<br />He has some insight on perception, observing, &quot;But I have always noted that to every disadvantage there is a corresponding advantage&quot; (p. 142).<br />I give this book my highest rating.

It should be noted that there are a few good insights to be found here, but not nearly what one would expect when compared to Lewis's other books. Furthermore, this is a posthumous collection that was edited from various sources including articles, speeches, interviews, which explains some of the reason for it being a departure from traditional Lewis work. I found the essay, &quot;God in the Dock&quot; to be helpful in that he argues for making the truths of the Scriptures understandable to people in the language to which they're accustomed. He explains, &quot;The popular English language, then, simply has to be learned by him who would preach to the English: just as a missionary learns Bantu before preaching to the Bantus&quot; (p. 149).<br />Chapter 24 is the transcript of an interview Lewis did with Sherwood E. Wirt. It contains a pithy quote on writing. Lewis says &quot;Writing comes as a result of a very strong impulse, and when it does come, I for one must get it out&quot; (p. 151).<br />Lewis addresses the issue of the preisthood of all believers by observing &quot;...a sacred calling is not limited to ecclesiastical functions. The man who is weeding a field of turnips is also serving God&quot; (p. 157).<br />I had difficulty deciding whether to give this book a 3 or 4 rating. The way I arrived at my decision was: compared to other Lewis writings it's a 3, compared to most other communicators it's a 4. As a result I went with the latter.	2003-10-07

One reason why this powerful book has stood the test of time is because it is full of practical wisdom that can be applied to one's life in any culture. Take for example one of the opening remarks, &quot;He that knows himself well, becomes vile in his own eyes, and takes no delight in the praises of men.&quot; In terms of living a separated life, we're told &quot;There is no order so holy nor place so retired that it is without temptations or adversities.&quot; The secret to overcoming, he adds is through patience and true humility.<br />On works of charity, he writes &quot;For God weighs the love with which a man works rather than how much work he does.&quot;<br />He reminds us that God knows how to turn evil into good.<br />The author tells us that habit overcomes habit. In other words to overcome a bad habit, replace it with a good one.<br />I strongly recommend this book. It is applicable to anyone wishing to live a more abundant life.	2003-10-07

The author defines focus group sessions as &quot;basically group interviews&quot; (p. 9). He adds &quot;The fundamental data that focus groups produce are transcripts of the group discussion&quot; (p. 10). What a researcher finds in focus groups is interaction among the members that is not found in other forms of research. The first chapter covers the history of its use.<br />Four aspects of group discussion are discussed:<br />1. The observer is advised to pay close attention to the difference between what participants find interesting and what they find important.<br />2. Note differences in perspectives as revealed through how questions are asked and answered.<br />3. Observe areas of agreement and disagreement.<br />4. Be aware that attempts to build consensus are found in group dynamics within focus groups.<br />In general this book provides the basics of introducing researchers to the expectations of using focus group for data collection and interpretation.	2003-10-02

This book is the story of how he, as one who makes his living communicating, lost his voice, and how he was healed by the Lord Jesus Christ. During his time of testing, his faith was being stretched. He describes various situations such as financial difficulties facing his college-age daughters. His wife told them, &quot;Girls, I don't understand what God is doing right now, but this one thing I do know; He did not bring us into the desert to kill us. He will make a way for us. Stay in school&quot; (p. 53).<br />On faith during such times, the author writes &quot;At times, it may take more faith for us to maintain the right attitude through an anonymous trial than to preach to fifty thousand people in a superdome&quot; (p. 61).<br />On receiving God's guidance:<br />&quot;Quit looking for the grandiose and look for the routine...trust Him to lead you into His will for your life&quot; (p. 64).<br />On Christian cliches:<br />&quot;When I minister to people today, I am very slow to offer empty platitudes...Instead of platitudes, I've learned the power of silence and touch&quot; (p. 95).<br />We're reminded that tests don't last forever. He describes the miracle he received from God and adds &quot;The miracle didn't just bless me. It blessed thousands of people&quot; (p. 140).<br />This is a faith-building book which I highly recommend.	2003-10-02

Accurate meaning is at the heart of such a study. In the preliminary to the explanation, the point is made that &quot;in the process of learning how to participate in social situations in the new society, the stranger gradually acquires an inside knowledge of it, which supplants his or her previous 'external' knowledge&quot; (Schutz as quoted in this book, page 19).<br />The familiar argument that qualitative research can supplement quantitative data and add an additional level of understanding is made by the authors. They list some ways including: providing a theoretical framework, validating survey data, interpreting statistical relationships, and deciphering puzzling responses (p. 27).<br />A good point is made about interpreting data when we're told &quot;...data are never rich in and of themselves, but are 'enriched' only by their being grounded in a refined theoretical perspective&quot; (p. 31).<br />Being objective, the authors tell us that theories, when combined, provide a fuller picture, but not necessarily a more &quot;objective&quot; one (p. 33).<br />This is a recommended book for social researchers doing qualitative work. It provides insight that would otherwise be missed.	2003-10-02

A person who experiences joy is not one who has an absence of troubles, but one who has learned to live abundantly in spite of circumstances. Swindoll tells us life was meant to be enjoyed, not merely endured. He advises us not to let circumstances control our emotions. On page 19 he writes &quot;There is nothing better than a joyful attitude when we face the challenges life throws at us.&quot; We told to laugh in spite of, not because of circumstances. He tells us to relish the moment. Live life in the now.<br />The confidence such people have is based in God. They trust His love, His sovereignty, His plan, although they may not see what the future holds.<br />The apostle Paul is a role model of living a life of this nature. Swindoll says Paul drained every drop of joy out of every day (p. 27).<br />Chapter two tells us that joy is a choice we make. It is a decision made from our own free will.<br />Chapter three sells us on this joyful way to live. We're told to regularly deposit the right kind of emotions in our internal bank (p. 51).<br />This book is full of positive, solid, Scriptural principles for how to live the life Jesus intended His followers to live.<br />It is a powerfully strong book.	2003-10-01

Chapter one tells us that anyone who achieves will experience it at some point. However, Christians can overcome satan's weapon of discouragement during seasons of failure, but knowing the truth. The encouraging news we're told is that God's ways are greater than what we can imagine. Scudder says encouragement of his nature helped him through seasons of testing, along the way he gained strength from such truths. The author reminds us that God is with us and has never left us.<br />On the issue of significance, Scudder writes \\"Every one of us is a unique creation of God, and every one of us has a different purpose and calling in the Christian life\\" (p. 11). In emphasizing that everything is significant, he adds, \\"The true mark of a spiritual man or woman is the desire to do any job, no matter how 'lowly'\\" (p. 26). He talks about working in a responsible way unto God, not unto man.<br />Spending time with God is a necessity for spiritual growth. Through prayer and Bible study, God is given a chance to work he tells us on page 34.<br />In the section toward the end of the book on love, he says he learned to love even when it wasn't returned. \\"When you get a rude comment, learn to forgive\\" he tells us (p. 158). This is a particularly insightful section in a book full of spiritual depth.<br />I strongly recommend this book as it has practical advice that will make any person heeding the words more effective in their spiritual arena.	2003-10-01

Books	4	14	15	N	N	Analytical View	This is the author's second book on the phenomenon of political correctness. He says he felt compelled to pursue the issue as he had become concerned that education had turned into a form of indoctrination. As a result, his writings are designed to expose some of the fallacies he's encountered. We're told &quot;This movement (i.e., political correctness) has had its crosshairs trained on the very heart of American culture and the traditions (the Judeo-Christian tradition, the work ethic, the traditional family, etc.) upon which that culture was founded&quot; (p. 6).<br />His documentation is strong.

A wide variety of popular culture contexts are discussed. David Crouch, for example, looks at how cultural meanings are represented in landscape while Sherrie A. Inness views the ideology of girls in girls' scouting novels.<br />Morris B. Holbrook's essay on the new nostalgia is a particularly interesting chapter. He talks about discovering the joys of popular music as he was entering adolescence and how it shaped his perception. Within that context he discovered the force of nostalgia. Like others in society, he learned that his buying patterns were influenced by popular entertainment.  He notes, &quot;In general, these echoes of the past form part of the cultural fabric of contemporary society. In particular, they exert an irresistible effect on consumer behavior. Indeed, their role in the consumption experience serves as the main theme of the present essay&quot; (p. 83).<br />He goes on to discuss the implications for baby boomers. The issue of the collection cycle is discussed. One's motivation for acquiring is also addressed.<br />Nostalgia, as expressed through various media forms is his next topic. He talks about magazines, television reruns, classic films, and old music. He goes on to categorize the genre according to decades.<br />Three orders of nostalgia are listed: third order or interpreted nostalgia, second order or  reflexive nostalgia, and first order or simple nostalgia.<br />This book is helpful in connecting the past with the present, with implications for the future in popular culture.	2003-09-30

While some of the concepts may be challenging to some readers, I think they reach their goal of readability for a non-scientific readership. From the outset, they get right to the heart of their subject. They explain, &quot;Uni-directional time, in fact, comes to appear as simply an illusion created in our minds. Frequently scientists who investigate this problem refer to our everyday sense of the flow of time, rather sneeringly as 'psychological time' or 'subjective time'&quot; (p. 23). Contributions of the various cultures and individual scientists that have shaped our perception of time is traced chronologically (isn't that ironic) in this book. This book helps a thinker to question various assumptions and ponder if there is really a separation between past, present, and future.	2003-09-30

This book teaches you how to gain more control over what goes on your your mind. She starts out in the first chapter explaining two primary truths from the Bible, from Ephesians 6 that we wrestle in the spiritual sphere and John 8 where Jesus told us that the devil is the father of lies. Consequently, the lies our mind believes are distortions which hold us back from attaining God's best. Chapter two picks up the familiar theme from Proverbs 23:7, as a man thinks in his heart, so is he. In chapter four we're encouraged that if the process of renewing our mind fails to reach its goal immediately, we are not to give up, that &quot;little by little&quot; we are headed in the right direction as we move forward. Chapter five affirms our faith. &quot;...it shall be done for you as you have believed&quot;, the statement from Jesus in the sermon on the mount, is the theme of this section. Jumping ahead to chapter 14, she associates a passive mind with one influened by evil spirits. We're told, &quot;the devil knows that inactivity, failure to exercise the will, will spell the believer's ultimate defeat&quot; (p. 137). An empty mind that remains passive is open to all kinds of deception she tells us. We are warned to guard against passivity. On page 142 she adds, &quot;you will not change your behavior until you change your thoughts.&quot; Moving into even more exciting revelation, she builds on this idea a few pages later by noting &quot;God has a glorious plan for your life. These are the truths you must think on&quot; (p. 159). She reminds us again that thoughts manifest themselves as actions. In emphasizing the importance of Bible study, she writes, &quot;God's Word is His thoughts written down on paper for our study and consideration&quot; (p. 164). This section also contains vital teaching on meditation and the rewards of reading the Bible. Part 3 deals with &quot;wilderness mentality.&quot; This book will result in positive changes for anyone who reads it with an open mind.t in positive changes for anyone who reads it with an open mind.	2003-09-30

His trials have given him a perception and degree of understanding that not everyone has attained. This book is Scripturally solid. On page 27 he writes, &quot;Humility is a frame of reference that perceives all of life as a gift from our sovereign and gracious God.&quot; He goes on to describe brokeness as a process of pruning. He teaches us that in that process God cuts off the non-productive branches, enabling the desirable branches to grow stronger and more fruitful.<br />He makes a powerful statement on page 34 when he says &quot;No one ever gets close to God without an overwhelming sense of impurity and frailty.&quot; Attitude is a vital key in the overcoming time in the midst of difficulty. Dr. Nelson says if our attitude is right, the trials will make us stronger.<br />I highly recommend this powerful book. The author is right on target. This book will help you to come out of your trials better than when you entered them.	2003-09-30

That's the message of this book. It is filled with quotable insights from a wide variety of sources. &quot;Great success demands great sacrifice&quot; we're told on page 16 and many of these contributors have paid their fair share. This book inspires one to give. We're reminded on page 21 that &quot;Ultimately we are remembered for what we give, not for what we take.&quot; In terms of cultivating the relationships in our lives, we're told &quot;The quality of your life is determined by the quality of the people in your life.&quot; There are so many good quotes throughout this whole book that it is a delight to go through and try to select a few to give a flavor of what one will find. Consider the quote on page 32, &quot;Everybody works hard when they feel like it, but only the best do it when they don't feel like it.&quot; In summary I'd just say &quot;buy it and read it.&quot; It's well worth the money and effort.	2003-09-30

He defines &quot;instant city&quot; as &quot;a type of settlement that condensed the protracted growth from wilderness to city into the span of a generation.&quot; Two Western cities which illustrate the point most clearly are San Francisco and Denver. It was the attraction of easy riches that caused the masses to create the two cities. The author tells us that originally location was important in a city's founding, but as technological advances enabled people to control their environment, location became less important. The settlers of these two urban centers brought patterns of city living with them to the American West. The concept of &quot;instant cities&quot; is traced back historically to the fusion of Europe and Asia, as built upon Greek culture. Barth writes &quot;Alexander's instant cities were cultural and political outposts ruled by colonial governors responsible to Alexander&quot; (p. 11). On the eastern U.S. coast, Washington, D. C. is identified as an instant city that grew out of the political need for a national capital (p. 37). In chapter 2, Salt Lake City is described as the first instant city in western U.S. This is a well-research book that gives insight to rapid urban growth as it spotlights two U.S. metropolitan areas.	2003-09-28

The second chapter carries the theme over to Mount Sinai and the law of God. In the third chapter we find Mount Nebo and the unfinished tasks discussed. That is following by chapter four's teaching on Mount Gilboa and the &quot;making exceptions of ourselves.&quot; The fifth chapter, Mount Carmel looks at Joshua's question about the choice confronting the people, i.e., choose you this day Whom you will serve. Chapter six, Mount Hermon describes God's covenant. In chapter seven, Mount Ararat, the focus is on a promise of God. In chapter eight, Mount Tabor the issue is &quot;facing up to life with God.&quot; Chapter nine carries us into the New Testament on the Mount of Transfiguration with Jesus Christ. In chapter ten, it's the Mount of Olives as we look at Communion. Chapter eleven looks at the sacrifice of Jesus on Mount Calvary. In chapter twelve we view the Mount of Temptation and God's way out. Chapter thirteen views the characteristics of the kingdom of God on the Mount of Beatitudes. This is an instructive, helpful book.	2003-09-28

On page 40 he tells us &quot;...most guidance occurs when we are not even conscious of it.&quot; God arranges circumstances in the lives of His children. God's guidance is referred to as &quot;adventurous&quot; in more than one place in this book and that is a good way to describe it. Mumford points out &quot;The world calls it luck. The Christian calls it providence&quot; (p. 44). Learning to walk in God's guidance is learning to cultivate an intimate walk with God he adds. This is a very helpful, inspiring book which I strongly recommend.	2003-09-28

We're reminded that Jesus told his followers that not even a sparrow falls to the ground apart from the Father's will and that we are much more significant than birds. Sanders points out that we one of us has unique giftings from God. On the next page he adds, &quot;The circumstances surrounding our lives are not accidental&quot; but are devised by God the Father. He tells us the circumstances are not just to guide us in terms of process, but to increase our knowledge of God Himself. Expect obstacles, he warns. These come for two reasons: to develop our faith and so that our character might be strengthened (p. 13). An element of mystery is included in the process of walking in God's guidance. Proverbs 3:5 is quoted. &quot;The disposition of events is not in our hands, but in God's&quot; Sanders reminds us on page 19. This book is a powerful tool of encouragement for Christians. I strongly recommend it. It will reassure its readers that God has a plan and as we trust Him, He will bring it to fruitition.	2003-09-28

This book presents a holistic picture of the industry. It is up to date on the latest technological innovations, while retaining pertinent advice that is valid for any time or place. Being a practical book, it contains a wide variety of vocal exercises in various contexts. The sidebars featuring working professionals extends the scope of the discussion. Professor Hyde is straightforward in telling students they should be prepared to pay their dues by working their way up from the bottom of the profession. The first two chapters discuss announcing in general terms. Chapters 3-5 address voice development and improvement. In chapter 6 video performance is covered. Other sections of the book deal with commercial and PSA announcing, interviewing, news, music annoucning, and sports. The concluding chapter is particularly helpful to students in that it tells them how to prepare a resume and market themselves for their initial job in broadcasting. This is a great textbook for students interested in entering a very competitive field. It gives them the facts and helps them prepare themselves in a realistic manner for what they will face.	2003-09-26

He identifies it as an &quot;explosion&quot; in technologies. We are in the process of adapting to changes in the environment brought about by these technological advances he argues. He accurately tells us life will never be the same again. Distance is becoming a factor that no longer matters as technology brings people closer together. He writes &quot;Where you dwell will be irrelevant to everything except your direct physical needs which, of course, include access to communications networks&quot; (p. 18). He emphasizes the importance the &quot;knowledge worker&quot; will play in the unfolding generation. These changes are rapid, he says &quot;We are on a social acceleration curve&quot; (p. 35). While some of the technologies he describes are already passe, the general argument he makes is still worth consideration.	2003-09-26

Chapter 3 tells us &quot;most creative work requires a healthy cooperation between intuition (right brain) and logical thought (left brain). Under the topic of cognitive style, the author says people's personalities and abilities are strongly influenced by their mental habits. Education has traditionally been biased toward left brain processing. A strong case is made for the use of both hemispheres. Reading this book is a good step in reaching that goal.	2003-09-25

On page 18 Pastor Hayford tells us &quot;the secret of discovering your life's meaning and purpose begins with Jesus.&quot; He goes on to add that time spent in prayer will reveal what He created you to do and be. Faith is necessary for the desired outcome he explains. A person must believe that God hears and will respond. In chapter 3 he develops this theme further, describing how he started keeping a prayer journal to record thoughts that came to him during times of prayer and meditation. One of the key tips found in chapter 4 is to find a new reason every day to thank Him. The matter of confessing our sins in prayer is also addressed. Pastor Hayford encourages us to listen to God throughout the day. He identifies the goal of holiness as &quot;well-rounded, fulfilling, workable living&quot; (p. 57). Chapter 6 covers God's guidance in our daily lives. We're reminded God has promised to guide our paths. The concluding chapter urges the use of a prayer journal.	2003-09-25

Schaeffer covers a lot of territory both geographically and in terms of subject matter in this book. Chronologically he starts with ancient Rome and goes to the 1970s, the time the book was published. Illustrations are included to assist in making his case. Schaeffer contends there is a flow or pattern to history and in this book he sets out to explain the flow of Western culture. On page 52 he discusses the role philosophy had in separating the influence of divine revelation as found in the Bible from man-made epistemology. He uses Raphaels' painting of &quot;The School of Athens&quot; (c. 1510) to illustrate the separation. Symbolically the painting depicts two viewpoints, one looking upward toward God, the other viewing lower sources such as man. In Europe this gravitation toward one or the other direction took the forms of the Reformation (God) and the Renaissance (man). He discusses the philosophies of the prime movers in each of the two schools of thought. On page 108 he notes &quot;Many good things in England came from Scotland.&quot; One of them being the concept of &quot;Lex Rex: Law is King.&quot; The concept was that no one was above the law, that it was the same for everyone regardless of rank or position. He traces the idea for the American Revolution back to these seeds planted in the minds of those of English ancestary. The reader is carried up to the 1970s. This is a thought-provoking book that helps a person see cause-and-effect consequences over the long haul. It reminds one of the observation of Russell Kirk, &quot;ideas have consequences.&quot;	2003-09-23

It describes the dedication and faithfulness of those who were passing the torch on in their generation. In the preface we're told &quot;The Protestant Reformation began in a scholar's insight into the meaning of Scripture.&quot; He adds on the next page, &quot;leader after leader could be described as a 'scholar' in some sense of the word.&quot; He says the Christian scholar's role is both that of divine calling and professional occupation. In the first chapter the focus is on scholarship as a Christian calling. Jerome is a role model today because of the work he did in his generation. We're told &quot;He is always occupied in reading, always at his books with his whole heart...He takes no rest day or night; he is always either reading something or writing something&quot; (p. 10). Another inspiration can be found in John Colet. Harbison tells us &quot;In him personal piety and professional purpose interpenetrated each other so thoroughly that when his friends wrote about him, the scholar always recalled the Christian and the Christian the scholar&quot; (p. 55). Personally I relate to Erasmus, not only for his scholarly travels, but also for his &quot;nocturnal lucubrations&quot; (p. 90). Chapter IV reminds us that Luther's movement which led to the Reformation started &quot;as an academic affair, a scandal in a university, begun by a professor and spread by his colleagues and students&quot; (p. 112). Calvin's humble origins and gratitude that God had allowed him to be a Christian scholar are inspiring as well. This is a very well-written book which is quite inspiring to Christian scholars of all generations.	2003-09-22

Currently, Las Vegas, Nevada is the city that most represents all the arenas of life in present-day America. Whether its politics, education, or sales, the metaphor that identifies what is valued is entertainment and Las Vegas is the entertainment center of the world. The second chapter addresses media as spistoemology, i.e., how do we know what we know about the world? It's by the images we see in the media. By the way, media indicates a mediator between us and reality. What we perceive is NOT reality, it's media's spin on reality. Everything in the media is packaged, i.e., with aesthetic considerations in mind, hence &quot;entertainment.&quot; This book is representative of Postman's body of work. He is perceptive, insightful, and causes you to see things you wouldn't otherwise notice.	2003-09-22

Hirsch argues that there are certain facts that a culturally literate person should know. He is specific. Globally he says English speaking countries such as Australia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States share one layer of cultural literacy based on our common heritage.<br />Inference is significant in reaching the full meaning of what one reads he says. He writes &quot;The reader's mind is constantly inferring meanings that are not directly stated by the words of a text, but are nonetheless part of its essential content&quot; (pp. 33-34). He categorizes good readers from poor ones based upon how much task-specific information they possess (p. 61). Hirsch makes some valid points in this book.	2003-09-20

Jesus told us it is more blessed to give than to receive. On page 9 Carlson writes &quot;Money is 'circulation.' It needs to flow.&quot; He doesn't limit giving to one arena either. He expands by adding, &quot;If you want more love, or fun, or respect, or success, or anything else, the way to get it is simple: give it away&quot; (p. 9). Being detached enhances objectivity and increases freedom. When a person is passionate about a process, it becomes a joy. Carlson reminds us that successful people find ways of overcoming challenges and are not limited by excuses. A few pages later he restates the point in an even stronger manner by writing &quot;A life without worry is a life of abundance, a life well lived. That which we focus our attention on expands&quot; (p. 59). Consequently, he admonishes us to think the proper thoughts to acquire the desired results. Carlson makes a point I've heard other writers make, i.e., we all have the need to be needed. &quot;Those who are willing to help others are always paid bacak in one way or another&quot; he tells us on page 70. He includes wise advice on thankfulness and making correct assumptions. This is a positive, encouraging, practical book.	2003-09-20

Senge accepts as a given that culture, markets, and organizations are changing. A learning organization is one that anticipates the changes and positions itself for optimal advantage. From a systems perspective, he advocates learning as an ongoing responsibility of every member of the organization. His logic makes sense. He devotes part of his discussion to the need of meditation and reflection. The vital role of interpersonal relationships is also addressed.<br />Concerning vision, Senge writes &quot;visions are exhilarating. They create the spark, the excitement that lifts an organization out of the mundane&quot; (p. 208). I'm sure a lot of his readers have experienced what he says about the lack of vision: &quot;In the presence of greatness, pettiness disappears. In the absence of a great dream, pettiness prevails&quot; (p. 209). He credits Robert Fritz with the first part of that observation. From the systems approach, he argues that the only vision people will pursue is their own. For that reason it is essential for the leader to &quot;sell&quot; the vision so others own it psychologically. Two people participating in dialogue help reveal insights that neither could attain independently he says. It is through enlightened dialogue that a person observes his own thinking. Senge makes a solid case that a manager who simply manages by the numbers may be deceived, thinking he is doing an effective job, when in actuality he has disgruntled employees, zero customer loyalty, and poor relationships with suppliers.  This book helps a manager gain insight into the complexities of organizational realities. I recommend it.	2003-09-20

A few pages later (p. 19) he explaining Romans 8:20, i.e., &quot;the whole creation was subjected to vanity&quot; after the rebellion of satan, we're told &quot;'vanity' means failure of the result designed, losing the original purpose, having no more direction.&quot; The whole point of the book is to point people in the direction of God, the Creator's purpose for them.

A famous quote from William James firmly establishes the book's theme: &quot;The greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitude&quot; (p. 1). Carlson builds on James' observation by telling us that fear, worry, and doubt eat up a tremendous amount of energy, thus robbing us of creativity and productivity. Getting outside one's self is the route to gaining a fresh perspective. We're reminded that by doing good to others, we feel better about ourselves. Another hint is in living in the present, for fear resides in the future. He includes a section on the Christian virtue of patience. Carlson argues that a clear mind reduces stress and allows for more fun. He tells readers to see difficult situations as challenges in life and goes on to encourage the random acts of kindness we hear about. A lot of his teaching is based on what the Bible teaches, however he doesn't present it in a Christian framework. Since it is largely solid advice, it is to be heeded and as it is, one's quality of life is improved.	2003-09-20

Why are some prayers seemingly unanswered? The answer is not easily attained. Even after finishing the book we still are not guaranteed that the mystery will be explained. At the heart of Rumford's examination is the issue of God's ultimate control over all of life. He sums it up on page 36 when he advises us to &quot;Trust God's heart even when we cannot read His mind.&quot; On the following page he adds, &quot;Tell yourself that though you cannot see the outcome, you can trust the Lord to do the best thing.&quot; Readers are encouraged to let go of their expectations and trust God for the best results, perhaps an answer they had not anticipated. Rumford says discouragement is the devil's tool for hurting one's relationship with God. It mentions that it wears down the spirit and drains the soul's vitality. There are seasons of waiting and preparing for answers to prayer. He encourages a proper frame of mind during such seasons. Joseph of the Old Testament is used to illustrate the kind of attitude he means. Joseph responded with forgiveness, not bitterness because his trust was in God. He was convinced that God's plan had prevailed over the evil intent of those who would do him harm. Timing is in God's control. If the answers to prayer are delayed, there are reasons. This book is particularly useful for people in a waiting season in life. It helps one to gain a clearer perspective that extends beyond the present crisis.	2003-09-19

We're told in the first few pages that no where in the New Testament are Christians urged to be failures in life. On the contrary, they are told to be overcomers! Allen makes the argument that God has given each individual a unique set of gifts, talents, and abilities that He wants used. On page 31 he tells us &quot;In knowing God, we know His will.&quot; Fulfillment is reached as a person does his best in the arena in which he has been placed by God. In chapter 6 he discusses prayer. He notes &quot;What you think about is the most important factor in determining what your life will be.&quot; Chapter 7 is an excellent teaching on faith, hope, and love. In describing the powerful force of love, Allen writes &quot;Love doesn't just calmly suffer--it returns good even for evil.&quot; If no other chapter is read, this is the one to focus on. It contains some wonderful insights on how strong love is as an overcoming force. In chapter 9, prayer is described as being part of the adventurous life. There are so many powerful thoughts in this small book, it is literally life-changing. This is a Christian classic for good reason. It is the type of book that after having read it, a person's life is improved.	2003-09-19

If He marked our sins, where would any of us be?&quot; Faith and love are linked in this chapter. Logically flowing from the first chapter on faith, the second one addresses capturing one's thoughts. He writes &quot;the devil knows that if he can capture your thought life, he has won a mighty victory over you.&quot; Wigglesworth reminds us that the ministry of Jesus did not end when He returned to the Father, but He continues working through those indwelt by Him. He goes back to the point he made in the first chapter, reminding us that God never fails to plan the best things for us. Faith is a consistent theme throughout the book. On page 46 he writes &quot;faith is the open door through which the Lord comes.&quot; There's an excellent section on intercessory prayer in the middle portion of the book. In terms of God's ways being unlimited, Wigglesworth phrases it &quot;God has a million ways of undertaking for those who go to Him for help&quot; (p. 59). So many powerful insights fill this book. It's a challenge to hit the high points, but another focused quote that brings out a poignant truth is &quot;there is one thing certain: there is no such thing as seeking without finding&quot; (p. 63). This book will make a powerfully positive difference in the life of anyone who reads it with a seeking heart.	2003-09-18

It was disappointing to have a sermon from a self-proclaimed agnostic advocating that religion be subordinated to &quot;science&quot;. Robertson acknowledges throughout the book that there are ways of knowing beyond logic (as processed by the left brain). The science part is informative and helpful. It's his added editorializing that weakens the book. He concludes it with a push for a &quot;new religion&quot; to emerge, some odd mixture of various existing religious. His argument indicates his religion is science, which contradicts what he argues elsewhere in the book, about different forms of knowing. He lumps all religions together, seeing them as essentially being all alike, with Buddhism being his slight favorite. I learned new information on the way the brain works, however I had to tolerate a lot of intolerance to my Christian faith along the way.	2003-09-18

Billy Graham focuses on that truth in this book. In the first chapter he discusses the reality of the spirit world and goes on to offer a rationale for a book of this nature. The second chapter is a progression of that thought as he describes the reality and nature of angels. Chapter 3 goes on to look at both the visible and invisble manifestations of angels. Subsequent chapters discuss the differences between humans and angels, angelic organizational structures, angelic rebellion, the ministry of angels, angels as God's agents, and Angels and the Gospel. The book continues by discussing angels involvement in the earthly life of Jesus. From there he goes on to talk about the role of angels in prophecy. A chapter on angels and death is included, as is a section on angels as spiritual spectators. The concluding chapter has to do with angels in the lives of Christians today. I highly recommend this book. He keeps angels in proper perspective, i.e., they point to Jesus.	2003-09-17

This book is not difficult to read and even though Soviet Communism is not the threat it was at the time this book came out, as a historical work this book remains a worthwhile read. In fact, this book helps show how such a dysfunctional system was destined to fail! It is to Orwell's credit that he is able to evoke such empathy from his readers for farm animals. He succeeds in doing so. Sometimes an anology can highlight truths that a straightforward journalistic approach cannot. This is an interesting little book that will not require much time commitment to complete.	2003-09-16

Included in this mix is the ever-present set of challenges facing the protagonists. As one of his characters says in this novel, \\"there is always trouble. One learns to live with it. A man grows through enduring.\\" A few chapters over one of his characters observes \\"men must struggle or they deteriorate.\\" Which leads to the addition of philosophy or worldview, another component of L'Amour's works. I agree with some of his sermonizing, i.e., issues such as a strong work ethic and bravery. I strongly disagree when he tries to subtlely preach acceptance of mysticism which is anti-Christian. Moving back to a more positive matter, L'Amour inserts elements of human relations in his works. For example in talking about Mariana visiting with Sean in this book he notes \\"she listened more to the man than to the words.\\" In synergistically observing people and location, he notes how one impacts the other by writing \\"in New England and in northern Europe the seasons were short and the air brisk. One had little time to do what needed to be done. In California the seasons merged, dreamed one into the other, and what was not done today could be done tomorrow.\\" If taken in context, i.e., specifially if one ignores his advocacy of anti-Christian spiritualism, he has a colorful, adventure story of the old West to tell.	2003-09-16

Friendly captures a slice of first amendment drama in his historic account of a landmark decision. His lack of objectivity shows, however, in such descriptions as &quot;Morrison was a puritanical Christian of courtly dress and manners&quot; (p. 8) and &quot;Minnesota Rag&quot; in the title. With that aside, Friendly goes on to provide the background of the individuals involved in this case. He tells readers of the prominent characters and their connection to the newspaper in question. Colonel McCormick, from Chicago, who had many more resources available than Jay Near in Minnesota, was drawn to the case due to press protection ramifications. Friendly goes on to describe how events unfolded.	2003-09-16

He makes some worthwhile points in this book, but the major weakness is he misses the mark when he writes that you and I are gods (p. 125). That's a lie! We're NOT!<br />The valid things he teaches are the principles taught by Jesus Who is God. He tells how to apply the Golden Rule, i.e., to do unto others as you would have them do unto you. He elaborates on a principle from Proverbs, that as a man thinks so is he by telling us &quot;you are always thinking, when you are not asleep, and you know that it is in the selection of your thoughts that your destiny lies&quot; (p. 97). If read with caution, and the lies are discarded, he makes some valid points in this book.	2003-09-16

She observed both extreme disorderliness, &quot;yet beneath the turbulence, an essential orderliness&quot; (p. 9). It was a period of rigid class distinction. The book paints a portrait of what life was like in the various levels of society. London experienced sudden and unmanageable growth, dating back to the end of the sixteenth century. The society was litigious, which caused a growth in that segment of the culture. The litigious element dated back centuries George claims. Christianity was an integral part of London life. &quot;Methodism doubtless counted for much both as a civilizing influence among the people and as one of the channels  of the growing spirit of humanity and the growing knowledge of the pooer sort&quot; (p. 26) she writes. She quotes John Wesley (1753)as saying &quot;so wickedly, devlishly false is that common objection, they are poor only because they are idle.&quot;<br />George uses statistics appropriately in painting her portrait. She tells us that between 1700 and 1820 the population of London doubled, going from 674,000 to 1,274,000. She attributes this growth to the fact that food prices fell, there was a demand for labor, wages increased, and the standard of living improved generally. Going back to class distinctions, she notes &quot;already in the sixteenth century the distinction had begun to show itself between the industrial districts east of the City and south of the Thames, and a district of wealth and leisure stretching towards Westminster and the Court&quot; (p. 73). She goes on to discuss the trend toward general education. In short, she successfully captures an era and a location.	2003-09-16

Niven has taken scientific studies, summarized their results, and placed them in a format that can  easily be read by the general public. He is to be commended for taking discoveries from the academy and making the results useful to anyone interested enough to tap this resource. To illustrate, I'll cite a few examples. He tells readers &quot;people who regularly keep a journal, or some kind of written record pertaining to their asperirations, are 32 percent more likely to feel like they are making progress in their lives.&quot; A person who wanted to know the source can find the citation in the back of the book and review the study in detail.<br />A second example, &quot;your success is far more dependent on your behavior now than it is based upon where you grew up, where you went to school, or whether your path so far has been easy or difficult.&quot; The source here is Arrison, 1998 and is listed in the bibliography. A third example is &quot;people who approach things with order, common sense, consistency, and persistence will ultimately succeed.&quot; Again, the citation is given. There are 100 &quot;secrets&quot; presented. This is an inspiring motivational book. I highly recommend it.	2003-09-16

It is a two-way process involving listening, not just speaking. &quot;In prayer, He makes known to us what is His will so that we can ask for what He longs to give&quot; (p. 15) Ogilvie writes. Throughout the book he tells us of discoveries he has made. On page 33 we're told &quot;I have discovered that thanksgiving prepares me to commit all my problems and needs to the Lord.&quot; The role of meditation in prayer is discussed. Dr. Ogilvie says God speaks through: the Scripture, our thoughts, and our inner feelings (p. 35). When it comes to hearing God, he notes &quot;we are given wisdom and insight we could not have achieved by ourselves&quot; (p. 36). Faith is added to the mix as he asks &quot;have we planned our life so cautiously that we're not attempting soul-sized challenges which only His power could help us achieve?&quot; (p. 45). Prayer causes us to be transformed by beholding God he tells us. Praying for other people is our responsibilty as intercessors. Chapter 5 is devoted to that topic. This book will help a person to grow spiritually. It is instructive and encouraging.	2003-09-16

On page 17 he explains there are two types of people, those who are wise and those who are not. His argument is that wisdom is possible to attain and it is the vehicle for arriving at the desired destiny. Lea tells us that God is the source of all wisdom and Jesus personified wisdom in human form. To obtains God's wisdom, a person must humbly ask God for it. Faith means we expect to receive when we ask. A sense of &quot;holy excitement&quot; is found in people who fear the Lord (p. 29). Such individuals want to please God. Dr. Lea reminds us that God created us and &quot;knows what will destroy the bodies, minds, and emotions he created&quot; (p. 40). Consequently, wisdom is alligning ourselves with His plan. Faith is not of the senses, but rather it goes beyond the physical limitations. We're told to seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit in practical matters and expect His response in answer to the promise made by Jesus. Peace accompanies wisdom he reminds us. Similarly, wisdom bears &quot;good fruit&quot; (p. 49).<br />In the third chapter, he describes how wisdom is both a gift and a process. On page 60 he writes &quot;it is a lifelong struggle to put ourselves into a position in which our will will keep willing to do the will of God.&quot;<br />This book is full of insight that can make anyone's life better.<br />I give it my highest recommendation.	2003-09-15

He bases it on the Bible. The book involves the reader with questions that can be filled out as various issues are discussed. He tells us that prayer is conversation with God. Listening is active. On pages 25 and 26 he tells us God wants to bring us through the process of growth all the way to spiritual maturity. That is His desire for us. After giving examples of God speaking to individuals in the Old Testament, Dr. Lea makes the logical argument: &quot;If God spoke to people in the Old Testament under the old covenant, common sense tells us that believers under the new covenant should enjoy at least equal privileges&quot; (p. 27). Relatedly, we're reminded that God will lead us as He promised.<br />In being led by the Holy Spirit, Dr. Lea emphasizes, &quot;It's time for us Christians to realize that Someone is living inside us and that there's nothing wrong with His ears or mouth&quot; (p. 55). Chapter 4 discusses walking in love, forgiveness, and obedience in order to hear God. Chapter 5 encourages us to mediate on the Word of God. The theme of the sixth chapter is praying in the Spirit. The eighth chapter tells of the importance of waiting in God's presence in prayer to hear what He has to say. Dr. Lea ends his book with a section on obedience. I strongly recommend to book to everyone.	2003-09-15

He talks about hearing God in prayer and learning from his fellow travelers on life's journey. Finding one's purpose is the ultimate goal. The author writes &quot;your right calling is just as much from God as is the minister's. It is the call of your destiny, bringing into focus what you are supposed to be and do with your life&quot; (p. 11). The power of having patience and persistence in reaching goals is eloquently addressed in chapter 6. He writes that those two character traits lead to personal growth and that &quot;each new challenge brings another opportunity for both&quot; (p. 31). In chapter 8 the necessities of rhythm and pace are discussed. Best results occur when the process unfolds based on proper timing. The same holds for achievement in human affairs also he notes. There are so many powerful, helpful, practical suggestions in this book I could not list them all without replicating the whole manuscript. My strong advise is &quot;buy it!&quot; It will improve your life if you read it and do what it says.	2003-09-14

Oral Roberts has the credibility to write about faith producing results because his entire life personifies that claim. He has experienced it first hand! This is a book about results. Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God. Contained in this powerful book are teachings based on the Word of God. He shows you how to apply the principles for desired answers.<br />He traces his own upbringing back to an era when people equated being spiritual with poverty. He says they mistakenly did not want to succeed, thinking it was the same as being worldly. His readers are allowed to share his moments of mediation and prayer as he sought answers from God on issues pertaining to the way God wants His people to live. He says his faith was misdirected, that his inferiority had held him back, robbing him of positive expectations. As a result he could not confidently pray for other people to see results in their lives. He goes into an explanation of his epiphany of Luke 6:38 where Jesus taught there would be positive results from giving. Those results would be that givers would receive good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over. The natural realm is governed by the supernatural and he writes &quot;miracles are coming toward you or past you every day&quot; (p. 197). He encourages his readers to look for the supernatural intervention of God. He emphasizes this by noting &quot;as you get into the attitude of expecting miracles, more and more will come toward you&quot; (p. 198). Hebrews 11 teaches that God honors faith and without faith it is impossible to please Him. Roberts adds &quot;He (God) has always done His work by miracles&quot; (p. 201). With God in control of one's life, Brother Roberts advises his readers &quot;make no little plans where you are&quot; (p. 212). I am thankful I was brought up in a Christian home like him. He mentions the contributions both of his parents made to his spiritual development. I feel the same way. I strongly recommend this book. If read with an open mind it will change your life in such a way that you will see positive results that are eternally significant.this book.

That is not to say they are inaccurate, rather that aesthetics dominates their work. My reason for making such a claim is that it seems their spin is more of an interpretation of history than a simple conveying of facts. That spin is based in a materialistic mindset. They see historical figures as being motivated primarily by shallow concerns, which I don't think was the actual case. With that established, there is a lot of material covered in this book which makes for fascinating reading. The era of the King James Bible is described. The Puritans took the Bible as their guide for daily living. &quot;Toward 1564 they began to be called Puritans--as a term of abuse--because they demanded the purification of English Protestantism from all forms of faith and worship not found in the New Testament&quot; (pp. 23-24). The majority of the London Protestants and of the House of Commons were Puritans.<br />Private libraries among the well-to-do in England were common at this time. Interestingly, public libraries were rare. John Lyly wrote a book in 1579 proposing to show that &quot;mind and character can be formed through education, experience, travel, and wise counsel&quot; (p. 67). The Durands mention &quot;old Parr&quot;, who in 1635 was presented to Charles I allegedly still in good health at age 152. There is a lot of history covered in this book. I would recommend reading it with an eye of receptivity to the facts, while disregarding the commentary inserted throughout, and taking into consideration the bias of the historians.	2003-09-11

This book helps a person to see how visualizing success leads to taking the actions which result in success. Positive thinking is a habit, which if cultivated, can change an individual's life for the better. The point is illustrated by a story attributed to Socrates. A stranger was asked what kind of people were in the city he left and he replied they weren't very nice, they were cheaters, liars, and those of similar nature. Socrates let the man know he'd find the same kind of people in Athens. A second man was asked about the kind of people he had experienced in his previous location and he said wonderful people. Socrates told him he would find the same kind of people in Athens. The moral is you see what you perceive you will find. Self-fulfilling prophecy can be found in personal relationships. Canfield and Hansen help their readers to see things from the perspective of the second person Socrates interviewed.	2003-09-11

Kushner bills himself as  \\"humor consultant\\" and in this book describes how to make his advice work for you. Among the contexts he lists are: conflict management, motivation, handling awkward situations, improving productivity, influencing coporate culture, and improving interoffice correspondence. He advocates keeping a humor file and readers can detect that he follows that advice because his book is full of anecdotes and quotes from diverse sources. Other than humor, his insight on communication in general is also quite helpful. Going back to the issue of changing corporate culture through humor he makes the point that a threatening environment is not conducive to a free flow of ideas, so \\"contrary to popular opinion, humor doesn't waste time. It can actually speed things up\\" (p. 126). He adds weight to his argument by including the fact that \\"a workplace stimulated by laughter tends to score higher marks in job satisfaction and productivity\\" (p. 174). Kushner remains readers a company is only as good as its people. In a marketplace where stress is a challenge, this is a book worth considering as required reading.	2003-09-10

This book helps people with an interest in pursuing the discipline by providing them with guidelines on how to get started. Local history is defined as a &quot;study of past events, or of people or groups, in a given geographical area&quot; (p. 4). The definition is expanded further in that it is described as a process that includes  learning. That learning includes an understanding of the causes of events in the past. In the U.S., history was first a leisure activity of men of means. Over time it developed into an academic discipline. This was in the 1880s. Newspapers in the 1930s viewed local history as an item worthy of publication in feature articles and columns. Institutionally the American Association for State and Local History linked local historians and professionals when it was created in 1940. Sources abound for researchers. The author notes &quot;Everything that men and women have written, touched, or made is a clue to the past.&quot; Gaining a holistic perspective is a challenge, that if not met can result in an inaccurate understanding of the past. That is, if key components are missing, the explanation misses the mark. In the concluding section, advice is offered to local historians: 1) read widely 2) recognize the plurality of the past 3) be responsible 4) write to be read 5) cultivate diversity 6) provide for the reader or viewer 7)write memoirs, diaries and journals 8) seek advice. Overall this book is very helpful in pointing people along the path to collecting and distributing valid local historical documents.	2003-09-09

Such is the philosophy of Metcalf, who along with his wife Roma Felible offer a set of skills built around that claim. The book has strengths and weaknesses. On the positive side, the argument that humor is a healing tonic has validity. They offer evidence of recent scientific studies that support this principle which goes back at least as far as the book of Proverbs in the Old Testament. Some of the skills they offer are doable and can be applied by virtually anyone. The disappointment comes at the end of the book. The chapter about death is NOT from a Christian perspective, but from that of a Buddhdist Since Buddha's still in his grave no hope is offered, just a shallow &quot;be positive&quot; which is an awful substitue for the promise offered by Jesus who is NOT in His grave.	2003-09-09

Thomas Jefferson's interest in exploring the western territory extended back a half a century as his  family had been awarded land west of the Appalachian Mountains. A week after Congress had approved funding for the expedition, Jefferson began writing his scientific friends about the matter. He had selected Captain Lewis to lead the discovery mission. While Lewis and Clark are linked permanently in American history, the two were distinct individuals. In 1803 they were not even intimate friends. An invitation by Captain Lewis to William Clark changed all that. Clark was chosen, in part, due to his competence and because \\"his word was his bond.\\" Clark was a woodsman who was familiar with rugged territory. From the President's perspective it was the Lewis expedition. The book goes on to describe the personalities and the personal weaknesses of the people involved. He adds a discussion about the intellectual property resulting from discoveries made on the trip. In all, a new dimension is provided that makes for a very well written book.	2003-09-08

Optimism is an intangible force that has practical consequences. McGinnis describes it as a &quot;can-do&quot; philosophy. A quote he takes from William James brings the theme of individual control out even more when he writes &quot;The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind.&quot; McGinnis argues that this mind-set can result in people being elevated to the top of their fields. In part this is because activity results when people are optimistic. Without action entropy causes a system to break down. It is through active involvement that entropy is successfully overcome. Activity is stimulated as optimists create and maintain synergy with like minded associates. Reading is another form of stiumlation found among this group. Even more important than relationship maintainence and good reading, McGinnis stresses the importance of prayer. Optimistic achievers are perpetually young regardless of their chronological years he points out because &quot;regardless of their age, they have a stubborn belief that their personal best is yet to be.&quot; More good news is reported in that optimism can be leaded. He says he read almost a thousand biographies and analyzed the lives of many successful people before drawing the conclusions he makes in this wonderful book. I highly recommend it.	2003-09-08

These four authors are to be commended for describing the climate of the FCC as television and radio were dominant forces of mass communication in the days before the internet. The marketplace was much more limited at the time and the era of deregulation was not in full blown force. In fact, the Commission took its watchdog role seriously in seeking to do what was in the best interest of the American people, not the players with the largest amount of dollars in the marketplace. In spite of all this, the agency misregulated the medium. The stage was set for the process to evolve as it has in subsequent decades. The authors contend &quot;governmental policies virtually precluded entry by additional networks.&quot; While the Commission's policy statement would mention one item such as diversity, there was no actual way it could be measured. A considerable discussion focuses on the network/affiliate relationship. This book helps to show the evolution of what became the &quot;marketplace model&quot; of regulation of the FCC of the early 21st century.	2003-09-05

With that statement made I can say he has some insight in this book that causes one to take a fresh perspective. For example, he writes &quot;I learned to feel passionately and express it without shame. I learned to laugh. I learned to see. I learned to care.&quot; He goes on to describe his passion for living. Relationships are important to him and he makes the point that a life of zest includes the cultivation of relationships. In some places he irritates me by the statements he makes on religion with which I strongly disagree. In other places he makes valid, perceptive points such as his statement &quot;each of our acts makes a statement as to our purpose.&quot; I would recommend this book with caution.

As a role model of scholarship he sets a high standard for productivity.	2003-09-04

Readers are taught the necessity of perserverance in goal attainment. A key is given to unlock the door to achievement, i.e., &quot;I will form good habits and become their slaves.&quot; Mandino stresses the point that true wealth is not in the material arena. Quality of life lies beyond the transitory nature of the physical. He focuses on enhancing generosity. In addressing interpersonal relationships he writes &quot;all hate is let from my veins for I have not time to hate, only time to love.&quot; He is inspiring when he drives home a theme. His talent is in his ability to repeat and approach the topic from a new angle so that the freshness is not lost through repetition. I highly recommend this book. Its principles have positive implications far beyond successful sales work.	2003-09-04

With that qualifying statement given as a disclaimer, I'd say he has some insightful observations to make in this book. He quotes Aristotle as saying &quot;Dignity does not consist in possessing honors, but in deserving them.&quot; He goes on to point out that we need the human touch. From there he observes that in many cases we only relate to people based on the function they provide. An example is a person selling shoes. We don't get to know the real person. That individual is exchangeable with anyone else who would sell us similar products. His discussion doesn't stay in the negative mode, however. In a subsequent chapter he describes how change is inevitable and that as our minds grow we do not ever revert back to our old selves. He clearly reminds his readers &quot;we are all teachers and we are all students.&quot; We continually change and are influencing other people all our lives.	2003-09-04

A quote attributed to Seneca helps sum up this book's theme, &quot;soil, no matter how rich, could not be productive without cultivation and neither could our minds.&quot; This book provides the proper nourishment for the productive mind. The familiar aphorism &quot;you are what you think&quot; is developed in compelling fashion. Mandino is skilled in maintaining a bit of mystery as he expands upon principles familiar to readers of this genre. He holds his readers captive by the storytelling talent few possess to the degree of a few masters. Pathos is built by the characters and the situations painted in the mind's eye as the plot develops. There are some powerful insights that will motivate any reader with an open mind.	2003-09-04

Gabor offers practical advice on how to go about accomplishing desired results. Throughout the book there are tips on how to go about turning dreams into reality. Key words include: commitment, planning, action, and persistence. Gabor is a self-confessed dreamer himself. He describes how he made his dreams come true and gives examples of other dreamers who did the same. I like the quote he included from Stephen Leacock (1869-1944), &quot;It may be those who do the most, dream most.&quot; To my follow dreamers, this is a book that helps you see reality unfold as you pursue that which is unseen in the physical. It enables you to &quot;see&quot; the future in your &quot;mind's eye&quot; until it becomes manifest.<br />A big portion of that transformation is in taking small steps, i.e., doing the little things along the way toward the dream. He devotes a considerable amount of time discussing how to implement one's plan of action. He encourages readers to &quot;take any that may further your progress.&quot; Action overcomes inertia and the fear of rejection. In summary &quot;go for it!&quot;	2003-09-04

Changing actions so the quality of life is improved is the bottom line of this book. He tells readers to identify the actions that will lead to the desired results and follow through. Behavior is influenced by words. Putting the right thoughts in one's mind leads to a person taking proper actions. Doing a succession of small things is a more workable goal than aiming at a large change he wisely instructs. Readers are given an interactive plan of action to make the changes easier to do. He goes on to talk about the related nature of success principles, how that success in one area bleeds over for a multiplied effect. William James' often quoted observation about thought following action is included. As a person acts a certain way the feelings follow. To be successful act the part and the feelings will come later. The medicinal value of laughter is presented along with documentation to verify the claim. Readers are reminded that success is a never-ending process. It is a lifestyle that Mandino and others sell in a convincing way. It can become a pleasant, healthy addiction.	2003-09-04

Such is the niche filled in this book about Ralph Josselin, a seventeenth century clergyman. Josselin's personal diary served as the primary source of information for this study. MacFarlane explains a point is to be made whether people who kept diaries differed from others. His conclusion is &quot;the very fact that he (Josselin) kept a diary suggests that he was slightly exceptional&quot; (p. 11). Josselin was a book man, an avid reader. He wrote &quot;I made it my aime to learne &amp; lent my minde continually to read historyes.&quot; From a Christian perspective, Josselin wrote of his work &quot;if the worke bee of God it will prosper, if not it will come to nothing.&quot; This slice of history is helpful in that it gives insight unattainable through any other means. I recommend this book to people seeking to know more about a reflective thinker of the 17th century.	2003-09-03

Dr. Waitley continues to turn out one quality book after another. These works are timeless and their principles are useful regardless of the date of original publication because they are taken from Christian truths. Take his teaching on belief. On page 118 he writes &quot;Belief as a positive force is the promise of realizing things hoped for and unseen. As a negative force, it is the premonition of our deepest fears and unseen darkness.&quot; Hebrews 11:1 is the origin of this discussion. Waitley goes on to talk about the power of the unseen by adding &quot;What the mind harbors, the body manifests in some way&quot; (p. 119). It's no wonder Waitley has sold so many books and held presentations all over the world. He has a valid message and is gifted as a communicator.

In the first chapter he identifies situations when the method would be appropriate: 1)little known about the phenomenon 2) different viewers between insiders and outsiders 3) outsiders having an obscured view 4) phenomenon hidden from public view. In arguing for the validity of what is discovered by researchers using the method, he writes it &quot;aims to provide practical and theoretical truths about human experience&quot; (p. 16).

While this snapshot was taken a few years ago, its lessons are still pertinent. The networks have subsequently made a few changes, but the landscape in telecommunications remains unpredictable. For a reader interested in media history, the philosophical stance of various network executives is covered pretty well in narrative form. Since the book came out at the end of Brandon Tartikoff's successful programming ventures, a significant amount of the book is devoted to his style of management. Auletta identifies five dominant powers influencing the telecommunications industry: the networks, cable, independent and affiliated stations, the Hollywood studios, and the telephone companies. This book is well-researched and written. It provides insightful analysis and commentatary on the condition of the fifth estate as it was at the end of the 20th century.	2003-08-28

Near the end of the book he writes &quot;I want to be thoroughly used up when I die.&quot; This book embraces that ultimate bottom line by providing a perspective on how to conduct oneself in daily tasks. On page 19 he points out &quot;Principles are self-evident, self-validating natural laws. They don't change or shift.&quot; The principles are identified, discussed and placed into context. Leaders who live with an awareness of success principles are compared to adventurer-explorers in that they are not sure exactly where they may be going, but are confident in the process. While they cling to principles, they remain flexible in leading the abundant life. Covey revisits his famous seven habits and places them in a leadership context. On interpersonal relationships he advises to forgive. &quot;As we bless them even when they are cursing or judging us--we build primary greatness into our personality and character&quot; he notes on page 65.<BR>This is a book that will enhance the quality of life of a person who applies its lessons.	2003-08-27

He calls his own shots and makes his own decisions on a case by case basis and as a result has detractors and admirers on both sides of the aisle. There are some practical insights included in this philosophical book. For example, on page 41 he writes, &quot;Life consists of tradeoffs: When we do X, we can't do Y.&quot; On reading, he says, &quot;Since the age of fourteen, I have had a love affair with books and learning, but this was always despite school.&quot; He lists three limitations of television: it is superficial, programming is solely based on the bottom line, and there is a lack of serious people watching. Prager gives readers elements of issues covered by media that are not mentioned when those issues are discussed. Consequently, he brings greater depth to public agenda items.	2003-08-25

He attempts to reach this goal through shared experiences of his own, coupled with historical analyses from other travelers from myriad times and places. His chapter on Van Gogh's Provence illustrates his approach. He uses correspondence between Vincent and his brother to establish the time and setting of the artist's more productive years. Readers are taken on something of a falshback as de Botton intersperses his own travel writing with that of the historical figures cited by him. He makes a valid point in describing the perception Alexander von Humboldt experienced as contrasted with a 21st century traveler. Humboldt was acquiring raw data and correcting misconceptions on his travels, whereas the contemporary traveler is biased in perception due to tour guides and promotional hype which package what is considered to be worthy of attention.<br />My major complaint about de Botton's book is that we don't share the same philosophical assumptions and some of his reflections are sermons for cynicism and fatalism although he sees himself as an advocate of freedom of thought. There's an uneasy subtext of fatalism in some of his observations and he seems blind to this fact. His interpretation of Scripture is not from a Christian perspective. So with that serious flaw identified, one can take the book for what it is, a thought provoking work that attempts to get a travler to look inward before seeking external stimulation.	2003-08-07

This book begins with the truth from I Corinthians 1 which talks about God using the foolish things of the world to shame the wise and the weak things of the world to shame the strong. It discusses the fact that talent, abilities and skills do not impress God, that He will use whomever He decides to use in whatever way He desires. From there the point is made that God is more interested in a man's heart than his giftings. Chapter two devotes a section to listening to God and responding to His call. Faith is involved in accomplishing God's purposes. &quot;God never told men to do something they could do on their own&quot; write the authors (p. 49).<br />This book reaches the goal of the title as it focuses a reader on the topic of &quot;the man God uses.&quot;	2003-07-25

He describes how one can put a smile on God's face by everyday actions. He addresses the assumption that people have that they must done something &quot;big&quot; to be significant by countering it with his premise that the small actions in life are actually the important things. The Scripture reference for his point is Colossians 3:23-24, &quot;Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve.&quot; He writes that life on earth determines responsibilities in heaven and &quot;the most important thing you can do is whatever God wants you to do at that moment&quot; (p. 165).<br />This book motivates a person to be diligent in every task, realizing that nothing is insignificant.	2003-07-24

This volume is representative of his work as there's a lot of substance in this small book. Maxwell has the gift of presenting age-old truths in a unique way. As suggested by the title this book develops the theme of building and sustaining a team as a means of goal attainment. He gives advice on how to tap and maintain synergy between team members. In the early part of the book he makes the point that we are all involved in various teams just by the nature of our lives. A marriage, work unit, church or any other social system consisting of more than one individual is a team. Consequently he argues that the principles in this book have the potential for widespread use. As expected it is packed with quotes and illustrations from achievers, a large number of whom are sports figures. This is an easy, enjoyable read.	2003-07-24

This book encourages Christians by explaining in a clear way what is meant by God's timing and how one can be assured that seasons of waiting are not exclusive of the plan, but an integral part of the process of obtaining victory God's way. I had read other writers refer to Dutch Sheets favorably, but this was my first Dutch Sheets book to read. Now I'm a fan! One can tell he writes from experience, i.e., that he has grown through the seasons of waiting and preparation and how has something of value to say which benefits a large audience.

The Commandents were given by God in a similar manner he says, to enable people to grow. He devotes time to the issue of being involved in the interests of other people and moving beyond the immaturity of selfishness.

The essential thread of the book can be found on page 34 when he writes \\"the pervading purpose of our lives is to become involved in creative relationships to mediate grace to others.\\" In the next sentence he adds, \\"Communication of hope to individuals is the calling given to every Christian.\\" From there he goes on to discuss the teachings of Jesus and the incidents recorded in the book of Mark. In talking about faith, he notes \\"When we dare to pray for his vision and attempt it by his power, that's when the adventure begins\\" (p. 109). On leadership, he observes, \\"Every leader must learn how to implement his vision without threats of force, authoritarianism, or loss of livelihood\\" (p. 129). A segment of the book addresses the necessity of rest. Ogilvie says it is vital to productivity. He talks about the practical application these principles have had in the work of his church members in Los Angeles, California. Meeting with other believers is not meant to be a ritual, religious exercise. On the contrary, he says \\"The fellowship of God's people is meant to be therapeutic\\" (p. 204). This is a positive book about a \\"life without limits.\\"	2003-07-18

He takes readers through a chronology of his life, however he doesn't spend a lot of time on details. What he does is highlight the major impact his dad had on his life. A significant amount of the book discusses the principles he learned from his dad and how he applied them to his own life. This intangible legacy, the legacy of Christian faith is one that has cause him to say he cares more about his eternal reputation rather than his place in history (which is temporal). There are some mundane matters his dad passed on to him as well, such as suggesting that he always dress for a position above the one he currently held to create the proper image. Overall this book provides an insight into the thinking of the author.	2003-07-17

If you want quality results, put in the right substance. This book contains the right substance. This is a faith-building book in that it helps people see themselves as victors rather than victims. Adversity is part of everyone's experience. How one handles adversity determines the quality of life. Savelle shows how to gain and maintain a proper perspective on life's challenges. He covers a lot of territory in a small number of pages. Jesus said He came to give life abundantly. He also said two principles sum up all the commandments, i.e., love God and love your neighbor as you love yourself. This book approaches overcoming adversity from that frame of reference.	2003-07-12

I had seen and heard variations and excerpts from it in different works and was curious about the actual classic itself. Honestly, when I first started reading it, I found it somewhat sluggish and repetitive. My thoughts were, ok, the gag was cute the first time, but it's growing somewhat old. It wasn't until I neared the conclusion that the message Cervantes was conveying reached me. The message I interpreted was that people have value regardless of class distinction or societal roles. While this sounds simplistic and commonplace for us in the 21st century, when one considers the time and culture in which the novel was originally produced, one realizes Cervantes was making a profound statement in an artistic, creative way. I identified with some of the characters and the situations in which they found themselves. Don Quixote helps us see that our perception largely determines what we see. His reality was based on what was happening within him.	2003-07-12

In several sections of the book he clarifies some misconceptions of terms that have become Christian cliches. Take, for example \\"faith\\" which he connotatively defines as \\"just another word for trust or confidence\\" (p. 93). He adds, \\"faith is the spiritual currency that moves mountains in the invisible world.\\"<br />Ho says his passion for seeking greater intimacy with God grew out of a time of deep personal lose. During that period he kept spiritual journals and recorded what he experienced.<br />We are reminded that hearing God gives us ultimate truth, that wrong behaviors grow out of erroneous thinking. Listening in prayer replaces erroeous thoughts with truth.<br />Ho has a section on prejudice, which is of course judging based on preconceived ideas. His \\"blind spot\\" is that he was prejudicial to the people of Arkansas and Mississippi when he talks about moving to become head of the Arkansas Educational Network.<br />Ho is to be commended for sharing his spiritual growing lessons with a public audience. His overcoming of trials has helped other people. His victories provide understanding that benefits other people. This book is replete with insightful, encouraging, motivational wisdom.	2003-07-12

Boa helps you to personalize the Scriptures to your individual needs. My copy is well-marked with thoughts, dates, and locations. Any tool that helps an individual grow in his or her relationship with God the Father through Jesus is to be commended. Prayer is two-way communication with God. There is a place for answered prayers in the back of this book. Both the Old and New Testaments are included in the readings. Intercessory prayer is part of the experience, i.e., he references Scriptures that pertain to praying for other people, including those in leadership. Jesus said the law is summed up in two principles, to love God with all your heart, mind, and soul and to love your neighbor as you love yourself. This book helps a person to do that on a consistent basis by getting one's thoughts aligned with God's Word and will.	2003-07-11

In the final few pages he describes a situation where he trusted God and in the middle of his stand for what he thought was right, things did not turn out as he had anticipated, however in time a favorable resolution was reached. Ho has been a TV executive who has had the courage to question the leaders of the industry on their home turf.<br />Ho's book is for overcomers, for people who want to know how to experience victory over their circumstances.<br />He discusses how he has applied the teachings of Jesus to his life experiences. He writes \\"In order to have a more abundant life, we have to give life.\\"<br />As former CEO of the Dream Center in Los Angeles, California he describes the miracle God performed when He \\"stretched our vision and planted an outrageous idea in our hearts.\\" This book is full of good advice on how to develop a deeper relationship with God.	2003-07-11

This book is part of a multi-media project in that it contains a music CD bearing the same title. After reading the book, the music is even more meaningful because it covers the background of the person who wrote the lyrics. Carol Cymbala, a pastor's wife who leads the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir, describes the challenges she faced and how they were overcome through faith in God. The focus of her book is not her as hero, but on God as deliverer. In fact, the lyrics to the title song, emphasize that theme, that in spite of the wavering of the individual, &quot;He's been faithful.&quot; It's a song and book of gratitude to God for his faithfulness. She gives the history of the early days of the congregation. She talks about how God added to the church. This is a testimony that is encouraging to other Christians in that it shows how God worked in one context, New York City, and causes one to realize what He did for others, He is willing to do for them. There are various individual stories contained in this work, i.e., different members of the choir have their testimonies featured throughout the book.	2003-07-10

This book is a gem in the genre of &quot;purposeful living&quot; books. Well-written, inspirational, and instructive, it helps a person see that he or she can indeed make a signicant difference. It is full of examples of the contributions people have made by applying principles from the Bible on a consistent basis. There are also many appropriate quotes that highlight the principles being presented. For example, Charles Haddon Spurgeon on persistence...&quot;By perseverance the snail reached the ark.&quot; A good deal of the book is devoted to the success process they observed from various Scriptures. The three step process: A) Start B) Hit Problems C) Experience Victory. This book is full of inspirational guidance. I gladly give it my highest rating.	2003-07-09

The Bible tells us that each of us has been given a measure of faith. Dr. Cho teaches in this book that it has been given to be used. He then proceeds to show how to use faith in the practical world of daily life. He describes the incubation process of &quot;things hoped for&quot; as consisting of: 1) envisioning a clear-cut objective 2) having a burning desire 3) praying for assurance and 4) speaking the word. Cho discusses the importance of what goes on in the heart and mind. The incubation takes place in one's thoughts. On page 31 he ties this into verbalizing what is in one's heart by noting &quot;your word is the material which the Holy Spirit uses to create.&quot;<br />This mysterious fourth dimension is the dimension of the spirt. Dr. Cho teaches that it governs the material dimension. &quot;Visions and dreams are the language of the fourth dimension, and the Holy Spirit communicates through them&quot; (p. 44). He points out that both good and evil are created in that mysterious dimension. He goes on to bring into his discussion various passages from the Bible about desires and dreams.<br />Perfectionism is addressed. Dr. Cho says God does not use you because you are completely faultless, but because you have faith.<br />This book is solidly based on the teachings of Jesus Christ. Dr. Cho has the results to verify that he has practiced what he teaches.	2003-07-09

One, human nature is the same now as it was in the old West. Two, like L'Amour I am fascinated with the era when the West was being explored and settled. The adventurers who carved civilization out of the wilderness were a commendable stock. Going back to the first feature, this book centers around a manipulative woman who is ruthless in the way she sets up other people for destruction. She plots the deaths of the lead character and 3 of his fellow cowpokes. The acknowledgment of bravery and mutual respect between Tell Sackett and Kahtenny, a leader of the Apaches is a secondary theme. In more than one espisode the two help each other even though they are techincally on opposing sides. This story helps demonstrate how there are various forms of knowledge. Tell Sackett talks of reading the desert like other people read books. Things such as tracks, flora, rock formations all have meaning for the astute observer. The weakness in this and other L'Amour books is the way he disregards the Christian way of life. His character saw it as something to be taken lightly. For Christians it is the only thing that gives meaning to life.	2003-07-08

Pastor Warren uses scriptural principles to show how one can attain a life lived on purpose. Readers who follow through with what he advocates have the potential of being tremendous blessings to other people. Warren writes &quot;Your ministry is your service to believers, and your mission is your service to unbelievers&quot; (p. 281). He goes on to describe how one's assignment is unique to each individual. Other people might criticize and misunderstand one's role in life, but Warren points out that pleasing God is the ultimate reward and in reality the only one of significance. Driving home his theme of making a contribution unique to the individual, he notes &quot;If you don't make your unique contribution to the Body of Christ, it won't be made&quot; (p. 241). The book is full of admonitions to make a difference. He emphasizes that the life of contribution is the life of satisfaction and fulfillment. It is in giving of one's time and talents that one finds and fulfills his or her role.<br />Connecting with other people is essential to fulfilling one's potential. On page 176 he writes &quot;You can't practice being like Jesus without being in relationship with other people.&quot; Throughout the book he talks about communication with God and the inner nudges one experiences. Along the same lines he discusses desires and promptings as clues from God about one's role. Warren's definition of worship is worth noting. He says &quot;Worship is a lifestyle of enjoying God, loving Him, and giving ourselves to be used for His purposes&quot; (p. 56). This is a wonderful book that can make a significantly positive difference in the life of any reader who applies its teachings.	2003-07-07

Senge uses systems thinking to describe how organizations maintain their effectiveness by learning and responding appropriately to changes in the environment. On page 12 he is explicit, &quot;systems thinking is the fifth discipline.&quot; As the manager or even a middle manager of a learning organization, win/win is essential to the well-being of the whole structure because &quot;in many systems, in order for you to succeed others must succeed as well&quot; (p. 50). <BR>Individual achievement is the necessary prerequisite to a learning organization. As individuals grow and change in a positive manner, the organization collectively becomes more effective. Approaching one's life from a creative, growth paradigm enhances the culture of learning throughout the organization. He discusses this matter in detail in chapter 9. In his chapter on mental models, he points out that two people see different things from the same set of facts based on their individual perceptions. A contrast is made between two people in the same organization. One professional might never grow intellectually after completing graduate school, while a colleague might challenge his own assumptions regularly. Senge gives some thoughts to ponder that have practical implications for an organzation's bottom line	2003-06-29

That's the genre for this book. In February 1986 Joyce tendered his letter of resignation to Gene Jankowski. He begins his tale of the events leading up to that action by first describing the early years of the organization he left, CBS. &quot;CBS News consistently measures itself by its past&quot; he writes. He talks about the &quot;glory days&quot; of Edward R. Murrow and the &quot;handful of young men&quot; who created broadcast news from scratch, with no model to follow.<br />It is hard to comprehend how corporate decisions are made. Dan Rather inherited a prestigious news organization as far as ratings were concerned. While his performance has kept the network at or near the cellar the entire time he's been in the anchor slot, he seems arrogantly secure in his position. Joyce  points out that both inside CBS and outside there was concern when Walter Cronkite announced he was stepping down, that Rather did not have the qualities necessary for the anchor slot. It was assumed Roger Mudd would be next in line to replace Cronkite. Subsequent ratings all these decades later showed Joyce's observation at the time was correct. Evidently the decision-makers at CBS have an agenda other than public preference.<br />There are other glimpses of the inner workings of CBS during the 1980s. For anyone still interested in CBS, perhaps better phrased, for anyone interested in corporate bureaucracy this book is full of examples of decisions that were not always the most logical.	2003-06-29

Mencken was born in Baltimore in 1880 and for his developmental years was a &quot;bookworm.&quot; He resolved to pursue a more active life as he grew and discovered his niche in journalism. In 1899 he went to work for the Baltimore Morning Herald and found the going difficult at first, but as he persisted he discovered that was where he was most suited and kept the title &quot;newspaperman&quot; the rest of his life. He remained in his home town and continued to live in the home his family had lived in rather than seeking career advancement in larger markets. One of the first essays in this collection is one he wrote about his hometown, &quot;The Baltimore of the Eighties.&quot; Another early one describes the local YMCA. His piece on Theodore Dreiser contains a segment on the art of communicating via the written word. A tribute to William Jennings Bryan which was published in the American Mercury in 1925 is included in this collection. Other pieces are on the people, times, circumstances, and issues of the era in which he made his observations. While I do not agree with him on many topics, his work demonstrates the efforts of a skilled writer.	2003-06-29

Although decades have passed since his criteria was published, it still serves a useful function. At the heart of the criteria is uniqueness and creativity. A show that is successful must meet the expectations of an audience member willing to invest time to watch it. This is a response discussed by sociologists employing a uses and gratifications approach.<br />Dr. Smith's book goes beyond program evaluation. In other chapters he talks about the issues the industry faced at the time the book was written. Looking back in retrospect, this helps broadcast scholars to see how the issues of that time have evolved to the current state of affairs. The story is unending.<br />In summary, this book remains pertinent in two regards. First, it provides criteria for television production that endure beyond a given time frame. Second, it describes what the key issues in the industry were at the time of its publication.	2003-06-29

Colson contends that the kingdom of God is within a person. It is not an external means of control exercised by political power. In the Epilogue he cites Winston Churchill's last words, &quot;there is no hope.&quot; But Colson counters that statement by explaining that spiritual things are not based on the circumstances of this present world.<br />On the other side of the coin, however, Colson presents specific examples throughout history where Christian have actively been involved in politics and government because of their belief in the eternal, unseen kingdom of God within. Having an awareness of things eternal, while contributing in this life is the balance he is seeking to describe.	2003-06-28

Johnson notes &quot;there was nothing scientific about him; indeed in all that matters he was anti-scientific&quot; (p. 54). The &quot;great thinker&quot; who knew what was best for the workers of he world never set foot in a mill, factory, mine, or any other industrial workplace as far as we know, Johnson tells us. &quot;He was totally and incorrigibly deskbound&quot; (p. 60). Perhaps that's why some academics will not divorce him regardless of the evidence. Seed reproduces after its own kind.<br />On a positive note, I found the reading habits of Ernest Hemingway interesting. In the chapter on him, Johnson tells us he read ferociously and was virtually never without a book. He shoved them into his pockets and when a free moment presented itself, out came the book. His working residence in Cuba is said to have contained 7,400 volumes. He sought to fill gaps in his education through his reading discipline. Johnson is to be commended for turning on the light in some of the hidden corners of the history of some of the personalities who seem accepted without much examination.	2003-06-28

Jumping to the postscript at the very end, Auletta observes &quot;while the Highwaymen enjoy immense power, they remain vulnerable&quot; (p. 355). This is the paradox presented throughout the book. The regulators, entrepreneurs, and public do a dance of vulnerability in the development of the new technologies as niches are being carved out. One of the realities of corporate growth is that as they become large, they sometimes lose the freshness associated with risk and creativity. Auletta says &quot;it becomes more difficult for them to maintain a focus, to make quick decisions, to stay creative&quot; (p. 134).<br />The ancient concept of pathos is explored in 21st century corporate America. In describing how business decisions are made in Sumner Redstone's organizational culture, he quotes an associate as saying &quot;most deals are fifty percent emotion and fifty percent ecnomics&quot; (p. 61).<br />Aulette spends a little time on media content, pointing out the hypocrisy of film producer Oliver Stone, who sees his distortions (to be even more accurate fabrications) as &quot;artistic freedom, while he demands strict accuracy from reporters covering him.<br />The reader is left with numerous insights that would not be attained anywhere else.

Five, researchers who wish to explore related topics have bibliographical leads in the documentation.<br />A writer of history is professionally obligated to re-create the atmosphere of the era Gottschalk says. And he adds that that skill can be learned. Readers are encouraged to see history from the human viewpoint, not just as a collection of facts and dates. He talks about a good historian as one who can put himself in the place of individuals of other times.<br />Two terms of his profession are defined for the readers. Historical method is the process of critically examining and analyzing the records of the past. Historiography is defined as the imaginative reconstruction of the past from that data.<br />Whether one is interested in writing history or being a critical consumer of it this book provides insight on the process that makes both consumer and producer better.	2003-06-28

Like John Maxwell and others who have paid their dues, he mentions the importance of learning from failure. One of the many useful quotes Bennis provides is &quot;it is not enough for a leader to do things right, he must do the right thing.&quot; Also like other writers in this genre, he says one of the fundamentals of leadership is to have a guiding vision. As a communicator, Bennis encourages potential leaders to codify their thoughts through writing. Writing eliminates ambiguity and helps one to focus. Leadership is viewed as a process in the sense that goal-accomplishment involves several incremental phases. He writes &quot;the goal isn't worth arriving at unless you enjoy the journey.&quot; A process of self-reflection is outlined and discussed in the middle section of the book. This is followed by some advice on how to investigate the world at large. Travel, reading, and involvement are three keys to learning the environment in which one is to contribute. Bennis has some ideas worthy of followup. His book is worth reading.	2003-06-28

He describes ethnography as &quot;the art and science of describing a group or culture&quot; (p. 11) The first step in the process is for the researcher to enter the field of study with an open mind. In attempting to describe a setting, there is no one acceptable standard. Multiple interpretations of reality exist. A study is one person's view of a given group, at a particular time. Although this limitation is a given, an ethnographer should seek to be holistic in presenting a study's findings (p. 21). An ethnographic study would include both structure and function. Structure is the social structure or configuration of the group. Function is the social relations among group members. Like systems theory, relationships are significant components of an ethnographic study. Symobolic communication is significant in revealing what is important to the people being studied. As an observer, a researcher using this approach is a human instrument. There are some biases, but the more experience one develops, the better one can develop his or her skills of observation. Fetterman goes on to talk about the difference between writing good field notes and writing the final report. In all the book clearly shows how to go about the process of doing an ethnographic study.	2003-06-28

The first of his seven habits is to be proactive, which is a logical starting point. Covey sells us on the idea of taking ownership of our lives. The second point follows logically from that as he tells us to begin with the end in mind. That is an epiphany to some people in that they have the action step in place, but are too occupied to consider the route being taken. Covey categories his seven habits into private, then public victories. This underscores his win/win theme. A person contributes to others as he has something of value to contribute, that is attained in the private arena. As one works internally, there is substance to offer to other people. This book has helped many people in many nations. I know that first hand. I was teaching a seminar in Lebanon and quoted Covey. I asked if they had heard of him and a significant number of hands were raised. Later, as I toured the offices I saw Covey posters with quotes from him throughout the facility.	2003-06-27

It is in that spirit that Gardner develops his topic. With the inevitability of change, openness to new experience is vital to self-renewal he claims. Being active in intentional change leads to growth rather than change by default he explains. Knowing how to creatively interact with changes in the environment is a learned ability that can lead to the development of new potentialities Gardner writes.<br />This interactive process is experienced at the individual level also. Gardner describes healthy self-renewing people as those who both give and accept love. They depend on other people and are capable of having other people depend on them.<br />Passion is part of the self-renewed life. He says people of that bent know they must have conviction about what they are doing and if they don't, they need to find something they can have conviction about.<br />The principles he describes at the individual level have implications collectively as well. He goes on to state that &quot;it is important that a society create an atmostphere that encourages effort, striving and vigorous performance&quot; (p. 20). It is within social systems that individuals make their contributions. A lot of wise insight is provided in this book. He leaves the readers better off than when they picked up the book to read.	2003-06-26

Although it is dated now, it is still useful in that it shows the trends experienced in the industry over the years. The five determiners of regulatory policy discussed in the second chapter remain in play. The FCC is the first of these. The Commission's regulatory philosophy is determined in large part from the other four: the industry, citizens groups, the courts, and the White House. While some of the specific issues being addressed in some sections of the book are history now, the examination of the process of the interworkings between members of the industry and the Commission demonstrates that politics is an integral part of what one sees and hears via broadcast media. This snapshot of the early 1980s era in broadcast regulation is still useful in providing a look at the role the regulatory process plays in determining popular culture content.	2003-06-26

He descrbes how it all started when he was an undergraduate at Yale University from 1946-1950. He writes from his conscious. Buckley is precise in describing how he felt traditional American values were being ignored, undermined, and distorted by academics. He makes his case by citing specific classes, instructors, and textbooks. In the revised edition he brings readers up to date on how critics and the public responded when the book originally came out. Buckley earned the right to be the quintessential role model for conservatives because of his courage and gift of clearly communicating his argument in a logical manner. There are no ad hominem fallacies here or in any of his writings. He confronts isses head on. He even discusses his motive for writing the book by saying it is tied to his love for his alma mater and the country in general. By that he means his desire is for constructive change. It is in pointing out the errors that he  hopes to achieve the positive resolutions he seeks. Buckley has remained a voice worthy of an audience in the marketplace of ideas for decades. This is the book that launched him and it is worth reading at any point in time.	2003-06-26

From there he launches into a description of his background, saying he had been a social scientist almost all his life (p. 1). On page 7 he says the book is not a textbook,that it is intended for three audiences: 1) for college students taking a course in social research it is a supplemental addition, 2) social researchers will find it contains essays of interest from the perspective of a colleague 3) general readers will gain some insight into the work of social researchers.<br />Babbie does not claim to resolve any social problems with pat answers. He says the &quot;power of social research, then, lies more in the realm of questions than in the realm of answers&quot; (p. 17).<br />The author's particular arena of investigation is religion. Studying religion caused Babbie to drift from his early training. On page 172 he writes &quot;while I was quite religious as a young person, I had become much less so by the time I began studying religion sociologically.&quot;<br />Overall this is a book containing essays on the study of sociology from a social scientist who seeks to explain what he does to a broad audience. He answers the question he poses originally in the affirmative, he does believe one can observe one's self.	2003-06-26

Before getting into those various contexts, Gottlieb gives readers an overview of the interviewing process by defining it as he lists some of the characteristics of conversataion as a contrast to an interview. These include: 1) two or more people 2) motive for speech 3) low level of structure 4) low level of purpose 5) satisfaction of a basic social need experienced by all (p. 5). This helps to show how in contrast, an interview is planned, structured and has a purpose.<br />In the second chapter he launches into an explanation of the structure of an interview. Interview skills are identified later on in the book. The various contexts where one would participate as an interviewer or interviewee are taken on a chapter by chapter basis and include: the research interview, the employment interview, the appraisal interview, the journalistic interview, the investigation interview, the persuasive interview, and the counseling interview. The book provides an adequate explanation of each of the types of interviews covered.	2003-06-26

Postman's argument is along similar lines as suggested in the subtitle of this book, &quot;the surrender of culture to technology.&quot; He begins with a legend and goes into a question about how we learn in our culture. The introductory section is followed in the next chapter by a look at the tools that paved the way for industrialization and later the information age. In the third chapter, Postman makes a poignant observation, in discussing the assumptions made by Frederick W. Taylor in his classic book on scientific management i.e., &quot;human judgment cannot be trusted, because it is plagued by laxity, ambiguity, and unneccesary complexity; that subjectivity is an obstacle to clear thinking...&quot; (p. 51).<br />His lucid examination of ideas, inventions, and public adaption continues. In the fourth chapter the quote that stood out most for me was one from H. L. Mencken who said &quot;there is no idea so stupid that you can't find a professor who will believe it&quot; (p. 57). I've been in academe long enough to verify that that observation remains the same now as when it was first written.<br />Anyone who has ever been the victim of the fill-in-the-blank mentality of bureaucratic thinking can appreciate Postman's comment that &quot;the invention of the standaradized form--a staple of bureaucracy--allows for the 'destruction' of every nuance and detail of a situation&quot; (p. 84). To make his point even stronger, he goes on to define a bureaucrat as &quot;little else than a glorified counter&quot; (p. 86).<br />Postman never fails to leave his readers with a perspective they didn't have before picking up one of his books. Read this one and learn a little more about how technology is shaping your perceptions often without your awareness.	2003-06-26

This book chronicles Jay's &quot;dues paying&quot; days in Massachusetts before he made it big. It contains wit, but goes beyond funny anecdotes. It gives insight into his career struggles. Jay seems to remain approachable due to the hard years he faced as an up and coming comic. Leno is, in a sense, a &quot;working man's comedian&quot; in that he had to earn the right to the position he currently holds. This book is instructive in that it teaches the principle of creative persistence by default, i.e., Leno did it and describes the process.<br />A few photos add to the story telling in the book.<br />He is honest about not being an ideal student during his college days. Leno's story has elements of interest to a general audience in that his story is a niche version of the American success story of rising from obscurity to national fame.	2003-06-25

He couples that with insightful analysis, such as his thoughts on opportunity which he says \\"will not be labeled 'opportunity.' It will be hidden. You've got to find it\\" (p. 35). The book is filled with motivational quotes from myriad sources. A lot of the principles he includes are from the Bible. Take for example his admonition on creating your best self. He calls it the law of self-determination and says, \\"you are now and you will become what you think about\\" (p. 116). This is from the book of Proverbs. From the New Testament he teaches what he calls the law of compensation and reminds us \\"as ye sow, so shall ye reap\\" (p. 116).<br />Books like this one help a person to stay focused on the way life really works. Near the end of the book, he sums this up by noting \\"self-esteem is truly a self fulfilling prophecy\\" (p. 197). This book could do a lot of good for a lot of people if its principles were applied.	2003-06-24

The book starts by explaining the purposes of criticism. It is pointed out that rhetoric or communication is &quot;a deliberate attempt to influence the choices an audience makes&quot; (p. 2). From there, six characteristics of rhetorical acts are discussed.<br />Subsequent chapters cover the various approaches to rhetorical criticism: the traditional approach, the dramatistic approach, the fantasy theme approach, the narrative approach, and the cultural approaches. The remaining chapters look at criticism in specific contexts, i.e., public speaking, film television, song, and humor.<br />The authors do a good job in exposing readers to a variety of approaches to the subject of rhetorical criticism. Their discussions are easy to follow and provide the essence of each of the approaches included. It was also a wise decision on their part to include the chapters featuring the specific contexts of communication. This helps readers to become aware of the various constraints found in a given means of communication.	2003-06-24

L'Amour is self-educated in the sense that he read extensively to make up for his lack of formal education. He recalls where he was when he was reading various books and the impressions made on his mind by the dual experience of reading and being on location at various places.<br />In the preface, Daniel J. Boorstin describes L'Amour's study which is inspiring in itself. He had thousands of books which were well-marked, indicating where he was at the time he'd read them and various thoughts in held at that season in his life. Boorstin uses a phrase to describe L'Amour's passion for reading, saying he &quot;luxuriated within the walls of his books.&quot; L'Amour also kept reading lists of books as he completed them.<br />This book made such an impression on me I followed through on his example. As a result I have learned how to use my time more efficiently. Having a book nearby is a great way to make productive use of time that would otherwise be wasted. This is an inspiring autobiography.	2003-06-22

Catherine Marshall left a legacy treasured by any Christian who reads her work with an earnest, seeking mind. When she doesn't know the answers and the mystery remains, she says so. Some things she doesn't understand and is honest about it.<br />From the perspective of Christian stewardship, she writes about the joy of being a channel of blessing to other people and the importance of giving, even if it is out of poverty. On using one's talents she notes &quot;the essence of creativity is to seek Him first.&quot; She adds &quot;He will show us how to make the best use of our talents and create something that other people need or enjoy.&quot; He certainly did that with her talents.

He describes the fact that time spent with God will develop into a saturation of His influence. In seeking God's ways, Burke notes there are two kinds of Christians: ones of the fallow-life and those of the plowed life. The former has lost the spirit of adventure, while the latter experience the miracle of growth that is only found in cultivated soil. He extends the analogy of growth by pointing out that fruitfulness comes only from cultivated ground. Since God is working within an individual, one's thoughts and inner life represent the soil to be cultivated. Burke builds upon this theme of the adventurous pioneering spirit, noting that such people are not satisfied with life as it is, but press on to deeper spiritual achievement. He notes the sheep that follow the Sheperd most closely are the ones who experience the best results.	2003-06-20

This book gets to the practical application of these principles. It literally tells you what to do to put them into practice. Readers are taught how to change self-defeating thoughts into thoughts leading to positive behaviors.<br />Even people who are already familiar with the value of positive self-talk can reap the benefits of this book by being reminded of the power of this potential which is available to everyone.<br />He gives examples of how it has worked successfully in the lives of various people from differenct backgrounds.<br />Unlike a lot of other books in this genre, he devotes a chapter to the abuse of positive self-talk by putting it into a broader context than most authors. Stoop addresses the issue of the sovereignty of God in the matter of faith and positive confession. He goes on to point out that self-talk isn't something we create, it already is going on, the issue is learning how to use this reality to one's advantage.	2003-06-20

He puts culture into its proper context by pointing out how rapidly things were changed by technological innovations of the time. For example, on page137 he notes &quot;there was no such thing as radio broadcasting to the public until the autumn of 1920, but that by the spring of 1922 radio had become a craze.&quot;<br />The nation was in some ways, still in the remnants of an agrarian society, poised to enter the industrial, urban era, but not making the full plunge yet. Perhaps a transitional time would be a better label to put on the snapshot of this period. The reason I say that is due to the description he gives of the swearing in of Calvin Coolidge. &quot;Business was booming when Warren Harding died, and in a primitive Vermont farmhouse, by the light of an old-fashioned kerosene lamp, Colonel John Coolidge administered to his son Calvin the oath of office as President of the United States&quot; (p. 132).<br />The book is full of glimpses which fit together to provide a hoistic portrayal of the decade.	2003-06-17

In the 1950s Washington, D. C. was not the metropolis it is today. Buchanan grew up in the nation's capital during a time of innocence and traditional family values. He describes the cultural influences he had in that era and how strong Christian values established his worldview. The impact individuals had on him, such as his dad, are discussed as he talks about the influence being more by example than rhetoric. He mentions sensing change in the air in the nation's collective viewpoint while in graduate school at Columbia University. Buchanan is a gifted writer. Books like this affirm the essence of what has become cliche, i.e., that truth is often more interesting than fiction.<br />Buchanan connects his personality with something larger than self, however as he links his life with the nation. He discusses where the country has been and the direction in which it is headed. He contrasts that with the social consensus found during the days of his boyhood. One senses that he feels that as others have passed the torch from one generation to the next, he feels responsible for making sure generations following him inherit a nation for which to be thankful.	2003-06-16

This is one of several &quot;hard questions&quot; John Calvin answers from the Bible in this book. John McNeill has edited the works of Calvin to indicate what he has to say on the various aspects of government. Calvin wrote at a time when he was exiled from his native France due to religious persecution. He discusses the role government has in carrying forth God's will in human society. Magistrates have a high calling from God he maintains. He says anyone going against a legitimate authority is opposing God because scripturally all authorities have been placed by God. However, those in authority have an obligation to serve as unto God and are accountable to Him for this stewardship. In answer to the question of war, Calvin says it is the responsibility of those in authority to declare war at certain times. He uses a logical inference from the Scriptures to back up his claim. This book provides helpful insight into the mind of one of the great Reformers. While his writings were done during an era of monarchy, they have application still.	2003-06-15

Ward shows how Jackson's persona emerged in the transfer of historical knowledge from one generation to the next.<br />In earning a national reputation as a war hero in the Battle of New Orleans, Jackson credited God with the victory and saw himself as a chosen instrument in His hands.<br />A city-wide religious ceremony was held in the aftermath of that victory. All New Orleans acknowledged humble thanksgiving to God for the successful defense of the city.<br />Riding the crest of this military popularity Jackson was elected president and the masses who turned out for his inaugural events were unlike any other before him.

Sequentially and chronologically Connelly takes his readers through that process using Robert E. Lee as the item of investigation. Along the way, Connelly makes commentary on the differences between the cultures of the north and south and how Lee's legion spread because of those cultural differences. That context has been well-established by numerous writers. Connelly simply uses it for a closer examination of Lee. For example, on page 102 he quotes another historian, Bradley T. Johnson in writing &quot;Environmental factors had forced North and South to develop contrasting socieites. The North, 'invigorated' by constant struggle with nature, became materialistic, grasping for wealth and power. The South's 'more generous climate' had wrought a life-style based upon non-materialism and adherence to a finer code of 'veracity and honor in man, chastity and fidelity in women'&quot;<br />This book helps a person to understand how history evolves in the process of retelling over a period of several generations.	2003-06-13

Isn't it ironic that the defenders of First Amendment protection threatened to go against the very argument they're defending in the subject of this book? This book is replete with such media hypocricies. This book could be used as a textbook for either media ethics or legal studies ethics. It is full of examples of the absence of both. Indeed seeing is not believing as she gives blatant illustrations where answers to questions were taken out of context and edited to make it appear they were the responses to particular questions. Interviewees' titles were inflated and the finished product was presented as a defense of the producer's thesis, not an objective journalistic inquiry. All of that in the CBS-Westmoreland case. In Sharon v. Time, the credibility of their writers, editors, and attorneys is laughable if this account is what really took place and she says it is. I don't understand why several people weren't in jail for perjury following these two trials. In the coda she claims CBS threatened her and her publisher and encouraged them not to print the book, but in their threat couldn't find a single factual error in its content. Even though these trials took place decades ago, they're still relevant as they describe the inner workings of two major institions, the legal system and mass media.	2003-06-13

Books	4	3	3	N	N	Provides Insightful Analysis	In the preface, Joseph R. Strayer makes an argument for studying history by noting it is &quot;the living connection between present and past which makes history something more than a game for dilettantes.&quot; In this book, Bloch presents the subject with a passion. On page 8 he writes &quot;history has its peculiar aesthetic pleasures&quot; and indeed it does. A few pages later, he describes how the process of researching and writing is as much an enjoyment as the end result by paraphrasing Peguy in saying &quot;the good husbandman takes as much pleasure in plowing and sowing as in the harvest.&quot;<br />Bloch gets philosophical when he discusses the variety of sources available to a historian. He says the number is limitless, in that anything man touches, says, writes, or makes says something about him. As &quot;art&quot; the process of investigation undertaken by the historian says something about the observer as well as the observation, Bloch notes. This is a worthwhile read in that it helps a person reflect on how history is recorded and passed down. Bloch is to be commended for perserving his reflections on the craft that held so much excitement for him.	2003-06-11

Helmstetter makes the point that all choices, regardless of how small they seem to be affect us in some way. The consequence is the individual is the summation of those choices.	2003-06-08

Biblical principles are used to demonstrate how one goes about living a life of significance.<br />Trust God for the outcomes in various projects, they advise. Similarly, they make the point that one should learn God's assignments in life. God made each individual the way He did for certain reasons. Assignments are related to an individual's makeup and composition. Another pertinent point they make is that God is the Lord of all of life, not a separate &quot;top priority,&quot; but to be part of life in its entirety.	2003-06-07

What I took away from this book was how unfair the legal system can be. Sharon had a judge blatanly biased in his favor. This is clearly desribed by the personal involvement the judge took on his behalf. He had the highest paid legal talent at his beck-n-call for free. He came across in this description as a mean-spirited \\"do it my way or else\\" type person. Reading the book many years after the fact, it appears the very reason he denied pursuing the suit against \\"Time\\" magazine was his true intent all along, i.e., to make a name for himself politically.	2003-06-07

He approaches his topic from a systems paradigm. Individuals create, but they do so within the context of a system. He also describes the &quot;child like&quot; wonder of creative contributors. He reminds readers that symbols in the office of past successes such as diplomas, awards, photos, reinforce the idea that valid contributors have been made before and can be made again. Regardless of one's arena, something about the process of creativity can be learned from the pages of this book.	2003-06-07

His sermons and books have encouraged me on numerous occasions. He helps me feed my mind the right substance. I identify with his migration to California from the interior part of the U.S. The way he tells the story is a true inspiration each time I read it. I was in the Crystal Cathedral in 2002 and it was liked standing in my dream. I was there, observing what I had read about and seen on television. In the American mythology, California is still the land of dreams.<br />Dreams which are given by God are to be pursued, according to Dr. Schuller's teaching. That's logical. His life shows how it's done.	2003-06-07

The pioneers of the medium were the first to pave the way. In a sense there is a taste of that adventuresome spirit in the trial-and-error period of the internet. New ideas are being tested. Looking back at how television developed in the 1950s causes one to realize the principles of creativity are consistent regardless of the method of communication.	2003-06-07

It chronicles the Kohmeini decade in Iran, 1979-1989 and describes how complex the politics of the region can be. The quagmire sometimes causes the U.S. and other nations to allign with questionable parties simply because options are limited. This book describes how some of those linkages come about.	2003-06-03

Kate McVeigh teaches principles of obtaining favor from the Bible and shows how they have operated in her life and the lives of other people. She gives several examples of favor in different contexts and demonstrates how God supernaturally opens doors and gives favor to those under the new covenant. She makes the case that because of Jesus, the new covenant is better than the old one and that whatever was promised to Abraham has been added to in the new covenant.	2003-05-26
