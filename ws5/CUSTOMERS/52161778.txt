Each chapter has an introduction of how is the weather that is just boring. And at the end why the bad guys just confessed their felonies?<br /><br />When you know who was the bad guy and why you'll drop the book of this nonsense story.

You don't have an inkling of who's the father. Who's the bad guy. What's the worst family secret. Simply you can't leave the book close for more than a few minutes.<br />After ending the book you'll ask yourself if you really have family problems.<br /><br />Excellent book.	2005-10-10

Part of the story could be real, but not even a quarter of the book.  The book will keep you in the story and in the time of the book. Nevertheless the real thrilling part begins after you already read three quarters of the story. Then you wouldn't be able to put the book down.<br /><br />The epilogue is worthless even if it explains what happened to John Dillinger. You can skip it and lose nothing.	2005-10-01

The paranormal story in this book will keep you reading and thrilling you. At some parts of the book KH will try to do something that couldn't be possible, but she never did. So at least everything in this book could be \\"real\\". I won't tell you what is because I will tell you the spooky story. The problem with this book is the end of it. I think that KH didn't know how to end it and she asked one of her offspring to do it. This end is among the poorest ends I've ever read.	2005-09-26

JP wanted to do an excellent thriller mingling his two archenemies in one book. All he did was a waste of time, paper, ink and anything else you'd like. The story goes out of the main plot so many times, or rather I say it goes in the plot so little that you forget what are you reading.<br /><br />The Weasel:<br /><br /> If you already read 'Pop Goes the Weasel' you'll know that the way Dr. Cross killed the Weasel is pathetic. Why? Because the Weasel is suppose to be ruthless and relentless and independent and very cunning. Everything that happens to him in this book made him conceit and reckless and meek and tame.<br /><br />The Wolf<br /><br />I don't know why JP wrote so many pages with this character, at the end of the book, the way the FBI's director knew who he was was dimwit. He could do that kind of investigation in the first pages of the book and we could save some paper and time with that. The way Dr. Cross get him was hilarious.	2005-09-20

The way Dr. Shields draw a new life to his \\"students\\" is  more than trite.

The plot to kill DeGaulle and its timing will thrill you all the way till the end of the book.

You'll think that she wrote this book just to finish the series. Albeit is a thriller in more than half book it has its very boring parts, for example the Xmas dinner or how Melody or Nick \\"fought\\" with Josh at the gym among others. I agree that this book is more a personal biography of Melody and Nick and has almost nothing to do with Unit One. So I think that JC could had finish this series with another idea. This doesn't mean that this book is a waster but definitively not the best of the writer.	2005-08-29

The problem is if you can find it before getting bored and fling the book away. If you compare this book with its prequels 'The Third Victim' and 'The Next Accident' you won't read even half book. Now, you have to have in mind that you don't need to read the prequels to understand this book. But you have to do it to understand why I only gave two stars to this story. As every human being, the writers have ups and downs and I think here LG was very down.<br /><br />Query:<br /><br />How is possible that a person drinks super-contaminated water and survive?	2005-08-19

It doesn't matter if you don't read paranormal books because they're spooky. Albeit this book has all of that and yes, you'll be spooked two or three times, it's worth to read the book because the plot won't let you put it down. The spooky part is almost nothing and you can enjoy an excellent reading even if you don't like that. And I have to tell you that the end of the book is really creepy but not spooky.	2005-08-12

After that, when the computer began to blunder and no one know what to do, that's when the book starts. So don't be disappointed with the firsts pages of the book. After you go through them you won't be able to put the book down. So I really can give this book SIX stars.	2005-08-06

This means that this story could be written with many less trees.<br /><br />3) The president's story is good enough but the first two assignments he has to do are worthless and a waste of time. Those you definitely can skip them.<br /><br />4) The story of the 17 years old drunk kid definitely doesn't have anything to do in this book.	2005-08-05

The problem is that it has some boring parts and some parts that you wouldn't understand if you didn't read first \\"The Third Victim\\". The best thing about writing continuous books is that you can read any one of the series without reading the first ones and understand it.<br />Maybe what I've should done was make one book of these two and make one big story, but I've to accept that the first book was pretty better than this one.	2005-07-28

The way the laboratory manages the virus and its personnel lacks in security all the time but that doesn't mean that is out of reality or it can't happen in many laboratories.

The book is too repetitive about how Buchanan changes his name and someone finds out his new name, made one mistake and one error until he blundered almost everything, but he is the only one to save his own situation.

The least of the times you take a book is to learn something really important. You read a book to have a good time, because someone gave it to you or any other reason you like. But when you read a book and you understand why are the killings at schools. What are the kids' main problems. That the deans has their own life and own problems and those problems implicate the students, maybe before you send your kid into a new school you'll want to know the background of the teachers and deans.<br /><br />At the end you'll think about the life of the police, their problems and how they solve them, the end of the book is not a happy ending, but it deserves SIX stars.	2005-07-14

One thing that I like of some writers is that they put women at the same par as men. Although is a good thriller you can take this book on your vacations and read it here and there and stop it when you have something else to do or maybe you'll end it in a long flight. It has many points out of reality like from where Diane and  Kelly have money to do everything they did, but that doesn't take down any star.	2005-07-04

Some times you won't know what to do, watch TV or read the book. The beginning of the book is very good, but as you read is getting worse and worse but the end is the worse of all.

You can compare this book with '1st to Die', that is a book! Not this one. Maybe when he'll write 'The Fifth Amendment' (I think that'll be his next book, but that doesn't mean I'll buy it,  the only way I'll read it is if someone lend it to me.) He will write it alone again.<br /><br />In this book Lindsay's team and nothing is the same, the only thing they did was to ooze margaritas, and her boyfriend just appearing and disappearing is just pathetic. I still think that Lindsay's first boyfriend in '1st to Die' had had to be alive and help her in all her cases confiding him all her dreads.<br /><br />When you read a trial and you know that the defendant is saying the truth. The plaintiff is taking the 5th Amendment to not commit perjury and the lawyer is fibbing with the facts is just pathetic. And the fact that you know who will win the trail it just make boring reading it.<br /><br />When the trial ends the book gets a real thriller, but that's only the last 100 pages or so, so you can skip this book or wait till someone gives it in your birthday.	2005-06-21

That part of the book is very good as KS explains all that happened to the kids. But the first third of the book is boring because it explains lamely what happened in the first book \\"Blindsighted\\". Nevertheless you must read the first book to understand this one, and the gist of writing sequel books is that you must understand the second or third book without reading the first one. To do that you must write in the sequel just enough information of the previous books. This book has many things about the first one but it never explains anything, so if you already read \\"Blindsighted\\" you will bore reading the first pages of the book, but if you didn't read it you won't understand anything.<br /><br />If you want to read more of this kind of plot read \\"Out of Reach\\" by Patricia Lewin.	2005-05-21

It doesn't have any sense and it was written just to fill more pages in the book.<br />When you read a spies' book and the FBI doesn't had any lead to the killer and the killer just give up because he thinks that he doesn't have to live anymore is pathetic, and more if this killer is an expert sniper and turned down the FBI twice before.<br />The plot is interesting and will keep you reading until the end, but at the end you'll be so disappointed that you'd have thought that you'd  never have read this book. I think you can skip this one and look for other FBI or spies' books from other writers for example:<br /><br />  'Dead Ringer' by JASMINE CRERSSWELL<br /><br />or  'Blind Run' by PATRICIA LEWIN<br /><br />among others.	2005-05-15

You'll get hooked since the prologue to the last chapter, but I think that it would be much better if Lindsay's boyfriend wouldn't die in the first book and he would help the Women's Murder Club. Of course is just what I think. And the way Lindsay found the bad guy is much better and credible than in 3rd Degree. So the ranking of these three books is exactly as they were written:<br /><br />1  1st to Die<br /><br />2  2nd Chance<br /><br />3  3rd Degree<br /><br />4  4th of July (June 21, 2005)	2005-05-08

The way that Diaz has to solve things will make you flabbergast. The way Milla and Diaz found who were the bad guys will thrill you. The way Milla found that Diaz didn't want her to find her baby will stun you. The way the Finders work will cheer you. The last chapter of the book will make you cry. BUT the last fifty pages before the last chapter when Milla was in her very best distress because she gave her son away, could be written in seven pages at the most. How many times can you read that she woke up, ate breakfast, went to sleep, ate lunch, etc.?	2005-05-03

But the end of the book is worthless, I think that the last pages RC said to his child to finish the book and he finished at his will. In the book are many loose ends that when you're reading the book seems important, but when you finish the book and you see that those stories never ended you'll be disappointed. I won't give you here these examples just in case you want to read the book. As always with all RC's books you'll think  twice  before going to an hospital.<br />Despite all of the above, you'll have a good time reading this book but don't expect an excellent end. Thinking better, don't expect anything at the book's end (the last two chapters and the epilogue.)	2005-04-25

But when you read a story that is nothing of the above, that could be written in half pages than is written, that has a Super Kid who can do whatever he wants in NY. Know how to go in the maze of an unknown house and can save her mother is just pathetic. This wasn't the first JS's book that I read, but if this were the first one I'd never read another book written by him.<br /><br />If you really like these kind of books where people is always in its youth read<br /><br />Fountain Society  by Wes Craven	2005-04-20

At the beginning you'll think that this book will be full of gore. I can't tell you that has none of it but the book doesn't get explicit on that scenes although you will understand them perfectly. The story of Sara and Jeff has its wrong things like how she explain to him why she can't have babies and he accept it just because. And who cuts Sybil's navel?<br />The investigation of the rapist is well written and at the book's end you will have a burden off your back.

When you get to the end is just pathetic, why?<br /><br />At first when Alex wants to know who killed her mother and she has all the arguments to do that will keep your reading. Then when her grandma tells her that she was responsible for her mother's dead you'll be hilarious, why? Because when Alex's mother died she has two months, and no one at that age is responsible for nothing. So here you will know that her grandmother was insane.<br /><br />Everybody supposed who killed Alex's mother, but nobody knows exactly and everybody is hiding the facts from whom knows who. That includes a suicide that is more than pathetic.<br /><br />The first time the killer speaks to Alex you will know that is the killer and at that moment you can close the book if you want to, because when the killer tells Alex how the job was done, forgets to tell her how gets the weapon to kill her mother, and that is a very important fact that you'll never know.<br /><br />At the end, the only one who knew who was the killer was Alex. She drops the charges and nobody does nothing about all the lies that everybody were saying to keep secret who the killer was and nobody knew who it was.	2005-04-14

Each new date has an introduction of how is the weather or how is everybody dressed, this is OK if it were only a few dates, but all the book is filled with dates.<br /><br />Contradictory:<br /><br />In the middle of the book Henry said that they'll never have offspring, and they have one child.<br /><br />Why in the very first date (when Henry is 36 and Clare 6) Henry knows exactly what'll happen next and in the first date that Clare meet Henry (Henry 28 Clare 20) Henry doesn't know anything of her although he tells Clare when and where they'll meet. And why he again knows everything when he mets his young self at the museum? Why he also doesn't know anything about the football player who beats Clare?<br />If Henry is dead how he can see her daughter in the future? If he can do that why can't he see Clare in the future? And not only when Clare is 82.<br />How will Henry teach his daughter to steal and mug if he is already dead?<br /><br />I'll not say anything about the pathetic Clare's \\"affair\\"<br /><br />Everything is repeated at least twice, when it happens and when Clare or Henry explains it and I don't like to read the same thing at least twice in the same book.<br /><br />When you read half book and you'll know exactly what the end will be, the book is a waste of time.<br /><br />IF YOU REALLY WANT TO READ AN EXCELLENT TIME TRAVELER'S LOVE STORY, READ \\"UNTIL FOREVER\\" by Johanna Lindsey AND WE GLADLY CAN COMPARE BOTH BOOKS.	2005-03-31

Too many diseases, too many deaths in the same manner. And at three quarters of it you know where does the diseases came from, so that make the reading a little heavy because you know that whatever they thought about the diseases is wrong. I don't know why, but 90% of RC's books are against Medicare or another Health Organization so I think that maybe RC started writing because he had a problem with one of these Organizations.<br /><br />Taking my jest apart, is a very readable book.	2005-03-29

Nevertheless, everything written in the book you will read it at least twice and that makes the book boring, albeit you'll understand the plot perfectly is not the way to write a book. JG wrote too many technical terms and that made the story slow and heavy and I really don't agree that this was the murder of the century in Vegas.	2004-11-29

Five stars for this part of the book.<br /><br />2) Predictable<br /><br />When the trial begins you will know who will win the battle, so this part of the book is boring because you will know the end of the trial no matter how good is the lawyers work.<br />When the trial becomes to an end you will know exactly what will happen with Christine. Two stars for this part of the book.<br /><br />3) The abduction<br /><br />When a person is abducted for one or two days you will read faster to see what happened with that person, when the abduction is for a week or a month you just stop thinking in the abducted person, but when the abduction is for more than a year and you already know how it'll end is just pathetic, and the way they found Christine is... you will know if you finish this book.

The story will keep you reading but many times you will know what will be written in the next page, many things of the plot can't be true as for example that anybody can go inside the back door of the morgue just like that, or in NY anybody could say to you that has to go to your home and you'll take him with you in your car and let him in, nevertheless is a good story to read.	2004-07-29

If you want to learn to do this it is fine to read it, but I think that if you only read this book to know how to build the nuclear sub you might find some trouble doing it.<br />The next 50 pages is the real story of what happened to the K-19 and it is interesting what was going on at the sub.<br />The last part of the book tells us why that happened  to the sub and tells us that the Russians didn't learn anything about this accident and maybe they had the same failure at Chernovil.<br />So, if you read from page 112 and read about 70 pages you will get the story.	2004-07-23

For an example I have these questions:<br /><br />  Q. How many times could a man pay another man to kill somebody, the killer fails and the boss gives him another chance?<br /><br />  A. I don't know if the mob knows it but at least four times.<br /><br />  Q. Why the target man, who knows who is trying to kill him and he saw him in a restaurant after he was in danger and just say hello to him?<br /><br />  A. Because the target man likes to be in danger.<br /><br />  Q. When the target man has the opportunity to kill the one whom wanted to kill him why doesn't he?<br /><br />  A. Because something in his head didn't let him even if he had killed many men before.<br /><br />  And as the energizer rabbit, I can keep going and going and going, my advise is to skip this book.	2004-07-21

Some times some police men wanted to work with out his partners, I think that that is not a working team no matter the reason, if you have a partner you must work with him.<br />This book is definitely a page turner, even if the case is really unsolved it has his high thrilling points and his down crying points, with this book you will laugh a little and cry a little too.

Because everybody knows that the grass is green, you don't have to read it in a book, reading these kind of \\"grass\\" makes the story boring and you don't want to know what will happen in the real story of the book, this is a really waste of time, paper and money for this book.	2004-03-03

The big problem of the book is that all those cases were for real, the people don't think if they are wrong, they want to judge the people just for their color , race or religion, is that OK with you?<br />The book is a little bit heavy in some parts, but is always in the story and never goes out just to fill pages, Excellent book.<br /><br />By the way, in the packages of Camel cigarettes is indeed a man, the feet of the man are in the hind ones of the camel, the man is in an obscene position.	2004-01-30

Does it really exist the jewish God?<br />While you read this book you will see that whenever the jewish people had a strong problem, almost from magic appear a man who made whatever it has to be done, spoke to everybody who has to be spoken and the jewish people save their problem. Who sent these persons exactly the time the jews needed? Why nobody can destroy the jews in 4,000 years and are the only people that survive that long?<br />I think the answer is yes.<br />While you read this book you will understand the history of the jews, why they think their way, and why they survived to all the history problems they had or even they have now, at the end of the book are to many biographies that make the finish of the book long and boring, but the main story of the book is amazing, but you have to have in mind that is a very hard book to read, you will have to be concentrated in the book, you won't be able to read it while hearing music or something else, you will have to be 100% in the book.	2004-01-08

And the second question was: how a woman can't feel the difference between two men in bed? You will see the answer at the middle of the book. One of the answers I won't tell you which is amazing and the other is that either John and Will are really stupid or their wife is.	2004-01-02

(1,250Mi), so in the first year they could say what is the length of the meter with out doing any measure, why? Because one of them saw his mistake and change all his calculations to put them more or less exactly as the other person.<br />This story you will read it in more than 350 pages.<br />Meanwhile in the book says how they do their measure about 100 times and I don't think many people will understand those measures, first of all because you never know which unit of measure they used, and it also explains the french revolution and things that really doesn't have to do with the story of the meter length.	2003-12-09

Another thing is that when the biologic father of Jane ask Bernie for money and his attorney told him why he didn't adopt her, he must adopt her immediately after he paid Chandler why didn't he?<br />When the judge say to Bernie that Chandler has the right to see his daughter once a week, that is OK because he is her natural father, no matter if he was in jail or if he didn't see his daughter in 9 years, but when he kidnapped her in the first visit, he took her out of the country with a fake passport in a stolen car, he didn't see his parole officer in more than two weeks and the judge give him (Chandler) his child again that is really pathetic, if those are the laws in California, thanks God that I don't live there.<br />The way that Chandler die is really unbelievable. and with that the book has to be finish, I don't know why it continue.	2003-10-13

That doesn't mean that the book goes out of the main story but at least I don't like to read twice the same story in a book, no matter if it is written in two lines or in two pages.<br />The story has ups and downs, is not a bad book but you will take some time reading it, so if you see it at your parents house take it, and before you read it get prepare for a heavy book to read.	2003-10-09

When you write a story that really happened you don't compare what would happened if that story would be in our days.<br />I wrote a book of the story of Cleopatra and I wrote my novel in the Antarctica, but I never made any comparison if Cleopatra were alive today, you just can't do that.<br />I put 2 stars to this book because I just can't put one star to a book.<br />But at the end you really think that Patricia Cornwell knows who was Jack the Ripper?	2003-09-29

My brother asked me if I want to go to the game and I told him that yes, so the next day he didn't offer me nothing for breakfast, I didn't comment anything because I thought that we will eat some hot dogs at the stadium, then I saw him to take some beers, sodas, meat and everything to do a barbecue so I asked him if we are going to a barbecue after the game, he just smiled.<br />When we get to the parking lot at the stadium I just didn't believe my eyes, everybody was having a barbecue I just started to laugh and laugh because here in Mexico you will never do that. (I don't remember who won that game nor the others games that I will tell you in this review).<br /><br />The second time I went to see the Chicago Bears with a friend, I knew that in the stadium they only sell two beers per person per time so in the line for the beers I told my friend:<br />\\"Buy two beers.\\"<br />\\"No, I don't like so much beer, I only want one.\\"<br />\\"I didn't asked you what do you like, I told you what to do!\\"<br />At the end of the second quarter I asked him for my beer, and he told me that he already drank HIS second beer.<br /><br />The third and last story is when I went to see the Houston Oilers at the Astrodome. Behind me was a group of ten or twelve persons, in that stadium were glasses that contain three beers, so they make a competition to see who drinks all the beer faster, so the first started and he drank almost all the beer but part of it went directly to his pants, everybody was laughing, so when the second started, the first make him laugh and happened almost the same as the first one, to make the story short, at the end, the person who won the competition was the one who has more wet his pants.<br /><br />Now, in this book the writer just wrote all the results of his favorite team of Soccer in England since 1968, that shows us one of two thinks:<br /><br />He has an excellent memory or he has a sports book to write them down, I think that nobody will check if those results are true or not, nobody cares even if you leave in London.<br /><br />If the book would say his stories at the stadium, it doesn't matter which sport is because you are not interested in the sport, you are interested in the people who goes to see that specific sport. If I went to a stadium about 10 times in my life (to see football) and I have this and others stories, I am sure that a person who goes to the stadium to each game of his favorite team must have many stories like this to write them, some of them funny and some sad, but that will keep you interested in the book.of Soccer in England since 1968, that shows us one of two thinks:     He has an excellent memory or he has a sports book to write them down, I think that nobody will check if those results are true or not, nobody cares even if you leave in London.

I think here is a big mistake, because when you are not religious and you decide to be very religious, you can't take that decision alone if you are married.<br />In the book you will read some stories that happened to him and you will understand why he change his mind, I recommend this book because you will understand why people get more religious, or vice versa.	2003-08-02

I know that the CIA and the FBI are always fighting like brothers, but you have to give a break to the FBI, for example:<br />The Chief of Anti Terrorist department of the FBI knows that somewhere in the US is an african terrorist who escaped from jail in Africa, he (the FBI agent) knows that the terrorist is dangerous is armed and he knows that the FBI is chasing him, so the FBI agent saw a guy behind his car, he is alone and unarmed and say:<br />\\"Hold your hands, FBI agent\\". What do you thing that happened to the FBI agent?<br />After that, and knowing that the terrorist just killed an FBI agent, another FBI agent chase the terrorist alone, no back up, the terrorist enter to a chinese cafe and when go inside the FBI agent saw that the cafe is empty, so he asked a waitress: \\"Where is the restroom?\\" What do you thing that happened to this agent?<br />Now, the star of the book, Sarah Cahill, she worked for the FBI, then she worked for the Anti Terrorist Forces of the FBI, she know something don't you think? She went to Central Park with his 8 years old kid and while her kid play base ball with another unknown kid she started to read, then when she finished she didn't see her kid and after 10 minutes or so she saw that four or five kids are knock him and then, in New York, in Central Park came a man from nowhere, save her kid and since then both are lovers, when that man appear to save the boy I knew who he was.<br />At the end of the book, that is as worst as it can be the person who solve the case wasn't the FBI, was a police from the NYPD, please give some credit to the FBI.<br />Now two big lies:<br />First: If you want to track a telephone conversation from house to house you need at least 15 to 20 minutes, but if you want to track a call from a cellular phone with 30 seconds is enough.<br />Second: In the book is written that if you want to destroy the World Trade Center you need an atomic bomb DO YOU REALLY THINK SO?<br />Thinking better, if I were an FBI agent I will sue this book.<br />Now the story of the book, here you will see how work the cellular phone, all the terrorist acts to the US since 1970 secret or not, and all the TOP secrets of the FBI. I don't know why the US want such agency, but thanks God that this book was written before 2001, because if were written after, in the book the FBI Agency would be closed.I will sue this book.<br />Now the story of the book, here you will see how work the cellular phone, all the terrorist acts to the US since 1970 secret or not, and all the TOP secrets of the FBI.

That the only thing that he wants is your money? That he cares about you? The only problem with the medical thrillers is that you will think twice if you want to see a doctor or if you want to go to an hospital.<br />This thriller is good it will keep you reading and you will see the two types of doctors that exist, one who the only thing he wants is money, and the other that the only things he wants is to cure people, I think that this profession is the most difficult to live with, in one hand you need to live, but in the other is with the life of a person that are you dealing for.	2003-07-12

Everything that happens at the investigation is written at least three times, (when Michael Daley discovers it, when he tell his ex wife and at the trial), this takes off about 40 pages, and at the end, when one of the suspects kill his/herself and wrote a letter and with that letter everybody knows who was the killer, and after that nobody could do nothing to catch him, is really pathetic.	2003-06-30

Nevertheless, the book will keep you reading page after page and willing to know what will happen in the next page.<br />The story of Crystal in Hollywood is the typical one, the problem is that many people like that kind of life, sincerely I don't like it and I think that is a pity that men deal with women like personal things.	2003-06-21

Even if it was written 7 years ago, we still have the same question, in the companies who has the power? The answer is not the men nor the women, the power is in the position of the company whether is a man or a woman who is the president, and when that president want something he or she will do whatever he/she has to do to get it, it doesn't matter if is his secretary or her personal adviser, it doesn't matter if nobody want to do this or that thing, if the boss say something they will do it.<br />The story of the book is different because is a man who make charges to a woman of sexual harassment, it is difficult to believe, but it can be real. The book will keep you reading all the time, but has a little mistake, you know exactly what happened in the first chapter and you know who is guilty, may be it will be more interesting if you didn't know exactly what happened until the end of the book.	2003-06-02

McCammon wrote 13 stories because is a bad luck number to many people, so we start with 13 stories. Of these 13 stories the stories that I would recommend are:<br />Yellowjacket Summer: This is a good story but it has a really bad end, you won't take anything of this story.<br />Make Up: : This is a good story, better than Yellowjacket Summer but it also has a really bad end, you won't take anything of this story.<br />Doom City: Is an interesting story and it has a really good end, as a matter of fact is the best end of all the stories, but it has no message at all.<br />Nightcrawlers: This is the best story of all, it has a good end and a message for all those people who were in a war.<br />Yellachille's Cage: Is a nice story and it has a very strong message, this and The Red House have the best messages of all the stories.<br />Night Call's the Green Falcon: This is the nicest story of all, this story could you tell to your children before they sleep (you will have to change one or two things to do that but is really nice)<br />The Red House: is almost as good as Yellachille's Cage.<br />Blue World: This story is good and it has a message for all the priests and two or three messages for all the readers, the book goes out of the main story many times, but is worth it to read it.<br />So here we have 6 good stories with good ends and two good stories with bad ends out of 13, I think you can choose another book before this one.	2003-05-30

Of course the main story the story of Lucky and Lennie is the must important but you are really interested in all the stories at the same time.

Japan is not the easiest place to live, but, we have to take care of what they are buying not only in America but in the world, because they don't invent anything, they copy everything, but they copy it well and they make it better than the original.<br />The end of the book is not so good because John Connor who knows the japanese very well assume what happened and why, he doesn't really know why ...	2002-12-14

Is the story of three friends that work in broadway at first and then in Hollywood, the story of Anne is the better one, is not boring and will keep you reading, but here I have a question, how much time could wait a young woman for his man when he disappeared and then she knew that he returned and he didn't wanted to see her? I think that is a big mistake of the book.<br />The story of Jennifer is a sad one and is interesting to read but not as Anne story.<br />The story of Neely is the worst, when she is at the hospital is boring, but what she made to her best friend Anne, well let me tell you I prefer enemies that a friend like Neely.<br />I can't tell that the book is worthless or a waist of time, but is not a good book. if you have another book to read will be better	2002-09-09

The story of this book is amazing, even if the story is true, it has parts that was invented by the writer, it has to many coincidences that definitely can't be real, but this parts make you keep reading all the time and wondering what will be on the next page.<br />The way that all the bad guys died is like an american movie, the worst they did in life, the worst they died, but that is part of the novel, you will never know if this part (the dead of the bad guys) is true.<br />There were two things that I didn't like, and of course you will never know if was true or not:<br />1) The husband of Felicity tells her that he love her and he will never had another affair, and at the first opportunity he decides to &quot;save&quot; his girlfriend and put in danger his wife's life, I said &quot;save&quot; because he knew (when you read the book you will understand) that his girlfriend and he will be dead after Dieter find his wife.<br />2) This point is why I put just 4 stars to this book, WHY? when a writer has an excellent book, an excellent thriller, an excellent everything, has to write the last chapter that does not has to do anything with the rest of book and that takes the smile from your face when you finish the book?	2002-08-31

John Fisk hated his brother and he really didn't know why, and other things that if I write them here you will know the story before you read it.<br />On the other hand the book will keep you reading almost all the time but is not the best of Baldacci.	2002-08-15
