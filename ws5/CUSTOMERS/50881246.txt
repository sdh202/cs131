Barron created a sweeping fantasy classic in the \\"Lost Years of Merlin\\" series. Now he follows up with a brand new series, taking place eight hundred years after the creation of Avalon -- \\"The Great Tree of Avalon: Child of the Dark Prophecy,\\" full of magic, chills and humor.<br /><br />As the book opens, legendary wizard Merlin rescues an orphaned eagleboy from a pair of mercenaries, and gives him to a flamelon woman with a half-human baby. He also leaves his staff with the eagleboy. The boys are raised together, but are separated when a pack of evil creatures try to kill them. Now Tamwyn is on the hunt for his brother Scree, but is haunted by questions about his own past. There's a prophecy that that year, both Merlin's true heir (and grandson) and the Dark Child of a sinister prophecy will come of age that year.<br /><br />Elsewhere, a young priestess named Elli is accompanying her snobby superior to a meeting with the Lady of the Lake. They end up meeting with Tamwyn, who is beginning to believe that Scree is Merlin's heir -- and that he himself is the Dark Child. But an evil sorcerer is threatening all of Avalon, disrupting the magical waters that sustain it -- and Tamwyn, Elli and Scree may be the only ones who can save their homeland.<br /><br />It's hard to take the story almost a millennium forward, with an almost entirely new cast and new problems. But \\"Child of the Dark Prophecy\\" has a certain familiarity, since Barron explores themes of good, the potential for evil, doubt, power and love -- just as he did in the \\"Merlin\\" series.<br /><br />One thing that hasn't changed is that Barron's writing is vibrant and lush, without getting bogged down in the details. Not to mention his healthy doses of humor, such as the snotty priestess's face being turned green by her facial. There are strange creatures, ranging from little shapeshifting imps to giant mud-dwellers.<br /><br />The one flaw may be the villain; his motives are excellent, but they aren't even hinted at until the final showdown. But, for clarity's sake, Barron also includes a detailed timeline that explains the events of the past eight hundred years, including the marriage of Merlin and deerwoman Hallia, and the war that precedes this conflict. This is very helpful, although don't read it until the book is over.<br /><br />Familiar faces pop up here and there. Merlin himself appears for only a short time; the Lady of the Lake turns out to be an old friend, and half-deaf Shim shows up again (tiny once more). A familiar evil character also returns late in the book. But the book belongs to Tamwyn, nervous about his possible destiny and his growing magical powers, and fiery Elli, with her haunted past. Though initially they despise each other, their friendship starts to grow. Eagleboy Scree doesn't get as much attention -- he spends most of the book in a cave -- but he's an excellent character when he reencounters his brother.<br /><br />Beautifully written and full of thrills, \\"Child of the Dark Prophecy\\" is a worthy follow-up to the \\"Lost Years of Merlin\\" series, yet will leave readers longing for the next book in the series. Another triumph.but they aren't even hinted at until the final showdown.

But in the eighth volume of Rumiko Takahashi's \\"Ranma 1/2,\\" things get even worse for the teenage martial artist -- he now has three fiancees and a newly-cursed rival to deal with.<br /><br />A mysterious young man, Ukyo, thrashes Ranma's dad and threatens to do the same to Ranma. Ukyo is a childhood pal of Ranma's, now a master okonomiyaki chef (sort of between a pancake and a pizza). But he seems angry at Ranma, for reasons Ranma doesn't understand and soon challenges him to a duel. It ends with Ranma and Akane discovering a shocking connection to Ukyo: \\"He\\" is really a girl, and Ranma's fiance....<br /><br />As if this weren't uncomfortable enough for Ranma, Ryoga soon arrives and tries to throttle Ranma for having another fiancee when he also has Akane. Ukyo clues in that Ryoga likes Akane; to get Ranma all for herself, she sets up a date between the bashful Ryoga and clueless Akane. Problem is, Ranma soon shows up as Ryoga's \\"long lost fiancee...\\"<br /><br />There's no fun in the sun for the Ranma gang, when Ranma sets ancient martial-artists Cologne and Happosai on a date.  Turns out Happosai raided the Amazon village a hundred years ago, and stole a valuable heirloom... which has three love pills embedded in it. And now Akane has accidently swallowed the \\"life\\" one. And finally, a trip to the circus reunites the gang with Mousse, who now has a Jusenkyo curse of his own... and a new grudge against Ranma.<br /><br />Ranma doesn't even need to turn into a girl to have romantic complications -- he has enough of them just as a boy. The eighth volume tallies his fiancee count up to three, with poor Ranma not responsible for any of the engagements.<br /><br />There's plenty of goofy humour in this one, everything from legally blind Mousse kidnapping a stuffed pig to Ryoga almost making out with the disguised Ranma. But it ends on a taut cliffhanger, with Mousse about to turn the captive Akane into a duck, so he can trap Ranma. Somebody get that boy a therapist.<br /><br />This volume also introduces Ukyo Kuonji, a girl who has been living as a boy for ten years. Ukyo is also Akane's biggest rival: Not only does she have a longer acquaintance with Ranma, but she's also tough, blunt, pretty, a good cook, and far wilier than the brutally ditzy Shampoo. And poor Ryoga gets his feelings played with once again.<br /><br />One of Rumiko Takahashi's most memorable characters makes her debut in the eighth volume of \\"Ranma 1/2,\\" bringing even more romantic turmoil in her wake.

But his early family life was marred by Duke's manic-depressive illness, and the question of who his biological father was (he now calls four men \\"Dad\\"). He made his movie debut in \\"The Goonies\\" when he was thirteen, and continued acting in various movies including \\"Rudy,\\" the recent goofy romance \\"50 First Dates,\\" and even created a sweet short film, \\"The Long and Short of It.\\"<br /><br />In 1998, Astin got the role of a lifetime -- Samwise Gamgee, hobbit Frodo Baggins' loyal pal and pillar of strength. So Astin gained weight, packed up his wife and daughter, and went to idyllic New Zealand for eighteen months. In this book, Astin reveals the hardships, the revelations, and the friendships from the vast movie shoot, and what came after.<br /><br />People just looking for more behind-the-scenes movie dirt may be initially disappointed by \\"There and Back Again: An Actor's Tale,\\" since it focuses a lot on Astin's non-\\"Rings\\" life. But this isn't just a \\"Rings\\" story -- it's Astin's story. He focuses not just on the \\"Rings\\" trilogy, but on his own struggles and triumphs. And his life story is an interesting read that seems to mirror Astin's own personality: erudite, funny, friendly, sad and family-oriented.<br /><br />But the \\"Rings\\" shoot is pretty fascinating, especially since Astin was right in the middle of it. He gives us a better idea of what his costars were like (Viggo Mortensen likes to \\"blow through a party handing everybody a copy of three different books that he's read, and then move on\\"), and how they felt about him. One particularly interesting part is Astin describing the time ex-Aragorn Stuart Townsend spent on the set, and the reasons why Townsend didn't work out in the role.<br /><br />Astin frank and candid, doesn't whitewash the truth, but also seems quite generous with his costars. Sometimes he comes across as a bit whiny and know-it-all-ish, but he's also the first one to admit it. Everyone has their arrogant moments, but Astin is brave enough to bare his unflattering mistakes before the world, and say he was wrong. And his writing (with Joe Layden as coauthor) is polished and literate -- not something you see in many Hollywood autobios.<br /><br />Astin also includes a load of personal pics. Most of them have a very laid-back, almost intimate feel -- the hobbits and their costars hanging out, showing off their costumes, bungee jumping, or filming (including Elijah Wood covered in webbing). Not to mention ones like Billy Boyd playing with Sean's daughter, or Sean and his daughter looking over the beautiful landscape of New Zealand.<br /><br />Sean Astin gives readers a glimpse of his life and work in \\"There and Back Again: An Actor's Tale.\\" It's not merely for fans of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" but also for fans of Astin and the moviemaking experience.he's read, and then move on\\"), and how they felt about him.

These people may be searching for love, for glory, for release, a burst of adrenaline in the desert, or for just a fling by the beach -- however, their problems and pasts will not go away.<br /><br />Eggers does occasionally dip into gimmickry, such as \\"There Are Some Things He Should Keep to Himself.\\" Don't expect much -- it's a few blank pages, which made me smile. But I feel a little cheated. He's at his best when he's unconsciously quirky, such as a cute conversation between God and the ocean in one short story.<br /><br />Eggers has done well in his past novel and memoir, but some of the themes of \\"How We Are Hungry\\" feel worn -- this man has a unique writing talent, but writers have to grow, and this writing doesn't show his mind or soul growing. The themes have not changed, and that lack of movement and growth makes it feel like he's just... stuck.<br /><br />That said, Eggers' writing is genuinely compelling and rich; in his rambly way, he's incredibly eloquent. His descriptions have a raw energy that can take your breath away, such as riding a horse in the desert. At the same time, he can wrap his characters in so much finely-drawn misery that it is difficult to not be moved by them. It's also the one area where Eggers stumbles -- despite the whimsy of the occasional \\"gimmick\\" story, the writing is dark and rather depressed. I'm not asking for sunshine and butterflies, but it lacks quips, wit and human insight.<br /><br />Those characters tend to feel like reflections of Eggers himself -- rather world-wear and melancholy. One woman, who climbs a legendary mountain in search of a purpose, is perhaps the richest character -- her inner thoughts are so real that they fly off the page. And she, like all the other characters, is hungry. Not for food, but to fill some emptiness inside that can't be named.<br /><br />Perhaps it's that inner hole that preoccupies Eggers' work, and the endless search is what keeps it from exploring the world. Despite a hint of stagnation, \\"How We Are Hungry\\" is a rich and engaging collection of stories. It leaves me wondering where -- if anywhere -- Eggers will go as a writer.like reflections of Eggers himself -- rather world-wear and melancholy.

It's a tragicomic experience, centering on the devastation of the Holocaust, and a modern-day quest for the past.<br /><br />A young Jewish American man -- same name as the author, Jonathan Safran Foer -- travels to the Ukraine. His reason: to locate Augustine, a woman who apparently saved his grandfather from the Nazis... only he just has a photo to guide him. He's accompanied by an annoying, flatulent dog, and an old man haunted by war memories.<br /><br />He also corresponds with the old man's quirky grandson Alex, and new revelations are made about both young men through their letters. And in the third story-line, we are treated to the history of Trachimbrod, an endearing shtetl full of peculiar people... which was destroyed by the Nazis long ago.<br /><br />\\"Everything is Illuminated\\" seems to be primarily about the past and present, and how those two things connect. To twentysomethings now, World War II seems as distant in some ways as the Trojan War, unless brought to life by someone else's words. Foer may not have been there during the Holocaust, but his unique novel will leave you thinking and wondering about the past.<br /><br />It's certainly an unconventional story. Foer has a quirky, offbeat style that gets a little off-kilter. And he bends everything from his narrative to the characters to the English language (\\"spleening\\"?).  Not to mention reality -- by naming his alter ego Jonathan Safran Foer, he blurs the line between fiction and reality. Is this based on anything real? Does Alex exist? Is there a Trachimbrod? At the end of the day, none of it matters. Even if these things don't actually exist, they certainly do have real counterparts.<br /><br />Foer's book is not quite a work of genius. Sometimes the fragmented, topsy-turvy narrative runs away from him. Not to mention that the in-jokes -- the flatulent dog, the Russo-American dialect -- do not age terribly well. But the humor and magical realism tinges start to fade as the Holocaust looms overhead. While the opening chapters may make you laugh, it becomes far deeper and more intricate later on.<br /><br />\\"Everything\\" may not be totally illuminated, but it is a quirky, sometimes saddening book that stumbles and takes a few risks. A flawed but excellent debut.-- the flatulent dog, the Russo-American dialect -- do not age terribly well. But the humor and magical realism tinges start to fade as the Holocaust looms overhead.

Soon he teams up with a wandering king-minstrel, a sharp-tongued princess and a furry creature called Gurgi to save Prydain from the power of the Horned King.<br /><br />\\"The Black Cauldron\\" has Taran and the others setting out to destroy Arawn Deathlord's evil cauldron, which turns dead men into unkillable zombies. But other forces are after the cauldron, including three peculiar witches who insist on trading something for the cauldron. What is worse, the company faces treachery from someone in their own camp...<br /><br />\\"The Castle of Llyr\\" ties up some loose ends from the first book, as Princess Eilonwy is sent to the isle of Mona to become a fine lady. But she has barely arrived when she is kidnapped by a minion of the evil enchantress Achren, her \\"aunt.\\" Taran sets out to save her, but must team up with the young man who wishes to marry Eilonwy -- even though Taran is rapidly falling in love with her.<br /><br />\\"Taran Wanderer\\" has Taran setting out to discover his past, since he feels he can't ask Eilonwy to marry him if he is lowborn. With only Gurgi at his side, he encounters evil wizards, malevolent bandits, and finally learns that his father just might be a shepherd... until a new revelation leads him to learn of his true worth.<br /><br />\\"The High King\\" wraps up the saga, with Taran returning home. But no sooner has he arrived than he learns that noble Prince Gwydion has been half-killed -- and the magical sword Dyrnwyn has been stolen by Arawn Deathlord. Now the heroes set out one and for all to attack Arawn's stronghold and get back the sword -- but how can they defeat a deathless army and a shapeshifting enemy?<br /><br />Finally, \\"The Foundling\\" fills in a few of the gaps with short stories that illustrate the backstory of the Prydain novels.

As if moving and being asthmatic wasn't bad enough, now he has had two nightmarish adventures, and dealt with the malevolent Morrow Days. In the third book of Garth Nix's dark fantasy series, \\"Drowned Wednesday,\\" Nix spins his best story yet in this series.<br /><br />Arthur and his pal Leaf are recuperating from the strange events of Monday and Tuesday... until suddenly the hospital is flooded. Leaf is abducted by a strange boat, and Arthur finds himself adrift on the Border Sea, on a hospital bed. After he's picked up by a shipful of friendly Salvagers, he finds that he's inadvertantly become the target for the malevolent pirate Feverfew, a mortal-turned-Denizen on a ship of bone.<br /><br />He also encounters Drowned Wednesday, who has invited him to lunch. But unlike Grim Tuesday and Mister Monday, Wednesday needs his help, because she is cursed: she takes the form of a whale, and has a monstrous appetite. She's willing to give him the Key, but he has to deal with the malevolent Feverfew first, and rescue Leaf. Unfortunately to do that, he will have to take a rescue submarine to a seaport... which happens to be inside Wednesday's stomach.<br /><br />For some reason, after the publication of \\"Grim Tuesday,\\" the publishers decided to halt production and rerelease the two previous books in hardcover. As a result, \\"Drowned Wednesday\\" took forever to come out. Fortunately, it was worth the wait: as writing and characters go, \\"Drowned Wednesday\\" beats the second book and equals the first.<br /><br />\\"Drowned Wednesday\\" more or less fits the mold of the previous novels: Arthur deals with the strange residents (rats and Denizens) of the various worlds, while trying to avoid being killed. It sounds grim, but Nix spices it up with plenty of humor, such as the stamp-collecting Salvager captain. One of the funniest moments has Arthur looking at a book about his adventures, which shows him as a buff action hero.<br /><br />Fortunately, Nix keeps the story from getting formulaic by giving new twists to the story. Not only is it a seafaring tale, but he portrays the Morrow Day Wednesday as a victim, not a villain. Though Arthur is initially suspicious, it turns out that she's actually rather pitiful. And the final chapter of the book ends on an eerie cliffhanger involving the Skinless Boy.<br /><br />The biggest change is in Arthur himself. In the previous two books, he was a reluctant hero. But now he is beginning to use the power of the Keys without worrying about it, and he is determined to deal with the other Morrow Days. Okay, he still worries a lot, but he's overcoming that; by the finale, he is much more comfortable as the Heir.<br /><br />\\"Drowned Wednesday\\" equals \\"Mister Monday\\" for humorous dark-fantasy goodness. Here's hoping that \\"Sir Thursday\\" doesn't take long to get here./>Fortunately, Nix keeps the story from getting formulaic by giving new twists to the story.

While occasionally his lead character's \\"top five\\" lists can be a little annoying, this is a charmingly original, wry and thoughtful novel - an offbeat romance for our time.<br /><br />Rob owns a little music shop in London, which is a good thing because he is musically obsessed -- pop music, he claims, makes him fall in love. But even pop music can't heal his heart when his longtime girlfriend Laura breaks up and moves out. What's worse, Rob has no idea WHY she broke up with him, and he feels mixed feelings about losing her (he cares about her) and her musical tastes (bad).<br /><br />He immerses himself in his rickety business with his weirdo employees -- these guys alone are worth checking out the book for. He dates a folk singer. He learns that Laura is now involved with the repulsive guy upstairs. And finally, he assesses his past sex life and romances (the top five, specifically), getting a bit of insight into what Laura's problem with him might be: He's stuck in his mid-teens.<br /><br />Thirty-five is kind of old to start growing up. But like many real people, Rob learns that it's change or die -- in his case, alone and surrounded by records. \\"High Fidelity\\" is a nice blend of musical/movie memoir, love story and belated-coming-of-age tale. It's kind of geeky and pokes fun at itself, but therein lies its charm.<br /><br />Hornby writes a nice, breezy kind of prose, peppered with plenty of pop culture and musical references. Not to mention the top five lists: Top Five Episodes of Cheers. Best Side One Track Ones Of All Time. Top Five Bands or Musicians Who Will Have To Be Shot Come the Musical Revolution. At times the pop culture name-dropping gets a bit tiresome, but it mostly underlines how quirky and mildly obsessive Rob can be.<br /><br />And oh, he can be quirky. He can also be a self-centered jerk, and a bit confused and clueless to boot. Hornby's alter ego is likable for his flaws, and somehow manages to shed a little light on how men think.

As if dealing with a lecherous little imp weren't bad enough, Ranma also has to deal with the dueling jealousies of two of his fiancees.<br /><br />In the mountains, a strange little figure stumbles out of a cave and makes its way to Tokyo. He soon encounters Ranma and Akane (and tries to grope both of them), and it's soon revealed that he's Soun and Genma's lecherous, thieving, nasty, pantyphilic old master, Happosai. To Ranma's horror, it turns out that Happosai is very pleased that his new student turns into a nubile girl...<br /><br />Since they can't throw him out, Happosai continues a reign of terror, kept only a little in check by Ranma: He goes on underwear raids, causes mayhem in the public baths, and fights Ryoga and Ranma simultaneously as he tries to worm his way into Akane's bedroom. And when Ranma defeats his underwear-stealing plans, Happosai takes very sinister revenge. But Ranma has some revenge of his own -- \\"woman repellant\\" that will send every girl running...<br /><br />No sooner has Ranma dealt with that than a new problem arises: Soun says a Dojo Destroyer has challenged them, and that he and Akane need to defeat the Destroyer. It's just a ploy to get them to fall in love, but the stakes rise when a real Destroyer shows up. The problem is, Shampoo is trying to lure Ranma on a date -- if he goes with her, he'll get the Instant Spring of Drowned Man.... but Akane might lose the fight.<br /><br />In this volume, Takahashi introduced one of her most entertainingly nasty characters -- Happosai, a vicious little geezer who constantly lusts after young girls. And alas for Ranma, he turns into a girl. It's unpleasant for Ranma, but makes for plenty of great comedy when the poor guy is constantly pounced on (in the baths, in the street, in the bathroom) by a creepy little man.<br /><br />There are also plenty of other amusing scenarios, such as when Akane thrashes Happosai in her sleep, or when Happosai gets lodged inside a teapot. The funniest is undoubtedly the bathhouse scene, where Ranma is forced to duel with Happosai with soap, buckets and his own nude body, but not before Happosai sprays him with cold water... on the men's side.<br /><br />And putting the \\"romantic\\" part in \\"romantic comedy\\" is the triangle between Akane, Ranma and Shampoo. Poor Ranma desperately wants to be all-guy again, but all his instincts tell him to go help Akane. He doesn't want to be on a date with Shampoo, but of course Akane thinks he does. Ranma being who he is, pretty soon he's trying to deal with both problems at once.<br /><br />The sixth volume of \\"Ranma 1/2\\" ups the comedy ante with the little wrinkled perv and his silky darlings.

These two artists have devoted a lot of ink to sketching scenes from J.R.R. Tolkien's masterworks, and in the \\"Lord of the Rings Poster Collection,\\" we get to see some of Lee's best work.<br /><br />\\"The Stone Trolls\\" shows the three trolls that Gandalf turned to stone in \\"The Hobbit.\\" Now they're mossy and immobile, as the hobbits and Strider walk by. \\"The West Gate of Moria\\" is an exquisite play of light and shadow, showing the Fellowship looking up at the glowing doorway. And the best poster of all is \\"Battle of the Hornberg,\\" a grimly detailed picture of the orcs flooding through the smashed fortress wall.<br /><br />On the Mordor front, we get three different posters. \\"The Black Gate\\" is a panoramic look at the hobbits and Gollum lurking on a stone outcropping, and watching as troops pass through the spiky Black Gate. \\"Gorbag and Shagrat\\" shows a pair of creepy orcs in full armor, waiting against a stained stone wall, apparently in conversation. And \\"Mount Doom\\" is a bleak slope of barren rocks, but with a light shining somewhere behind the mountain.<br /><br />Perhaps the only flaw of this collection is that three of the pictures are from \\"Return of the King,\\" and only from Mordor. Don't expect any coronations or Grey Ships in this. A little more variation would have been nice, but the posters themselves are lovely -- high quality paper, clear reproduction.

And then there's the \\"Golden Hall,\\" a beautiful landscape crowned by a hill, on top of which is Theoden's home. Lee's painted clouds look as if they are glowing.<br /><br />\\"Orthanc\\" shifts the focus to grimmer subjects -- Saruman's stronghold is immense, menacing, vaguely insectile with its black shiny look. And, of course, it's surrounded by floodwater. \\"The Siege of Gondor\\" is tightly packed with grinning, creepy orcs with spears, and a few human warriors, one of whom is dead. And \\"Two Orcs\\" has a pair of suitably creepy-looking orcs, not doing much.<br /><br />Of the two poster collections of Lee's work, the second is obviously superior.

Now with the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It has quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it, set the tone for most fantasy ever since, topped many \\"best book\\" polls, and helped spawn such entertainment phenomena as \\"Star Wars.\\"<br /><br />Following up on events in \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" stars the quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.<br /><br />\\"The Two Towers\\" begins directly after \\"Fellowship,\\" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them. His cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs from the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.<br /><br />\\"Return of the King\\" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.<br /><br />\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.<br /><br />Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual. Merry and Pippin start out a bit flaky, but are matured by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue can range from goofy and hilarious to solemn and archaic, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary -- readers with short attention spans won't be able to handle this story. If they can handle sprawling, epic tales, then probably they can.<br /><br />Even after all the years, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and few books have even come close to equalling it.rd of the Rings\\" still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature.

Ulrika Jonsson is one of those celebrities mainly known on her own territory -- namely, the U.K. That gives American readers of her autobiography, \\"Honest,\\" a chance to take her as she is, without tabloids and rumors tainting it. Unfortunately, \\"Honest\\" as she is, the portrait she paints is not flattering at all.<br /><br />She was born into a troubled Swedish family that disintegrated, mainly because of her father's philandering -- a trait that she began copying when she got married. Though her husband forgave her, and they soon had a son, Ulrika dumped him in favor of a muscle-bound Gladiator.<br /><br />As this was going on, Ulrika's star was rising in the world, resulting in a weathergirl job, commercials, hostings and her own show. But she was in a series of bad relationships, with a crazed footballer, a cold-hearted German, and Britain's most famous coach. Then she found that her unborn daughter Bo had a serious heart defect that might kill her.<br /><br />The final eighth of the book is perhaps the most compelling -- Ulrika struggling to be a single mom, without emotional support, while her daughter is undergoing one surgery after another. Despite the lackluster prose of her biography, it's a moving story that gives the heartstrings a little tug.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the decisions that led her to that problem make Ulrika look dim and selfish. She apparently believes any absurd story she's told, such as \\"my ex-girlfriend lives with me, but only to houseclean.\\" And it's hard to sympathize with her string of disastrous relationships, when she dumped a sweet, tender, loving Mr. Right so she could play the field with Bad Boys. Ulrika repeatedly tries to justify her infidelity by claiming that she couldn't help it -- that it was inevitable. Uh-huh, sure.<br /><br />Ulrika also has the disturbing tendency to dehumanize anyone she doesn't like -- she refers to an abusive ex as \\"Mr. C\\" for a long while, and later disdainfully refers to her lover Sven's girlfriend as \\"the Italian.\\" Not her name, Nancy Dell'Olio. \\"The Italian,\\" like a character from a bad gothic novel.<br /><br />On the flip side, she seems to retain a bizarre adoration for her abusive ex-boyfriends, including one who kicked her in the head, and another who abandoned her with a newborn baby. Additionally, there's a near-obsession with her children. At one point, she flips out because she might have to spend a week or two away from her son.<br /><br />While the story about her critically ill daughter is a winner, the rest of Ulrika's story is a string of grating affairs -- affairs that a smarter woman would have avoided. \\"Honest\\" makes Ulrika seem like a real person... but sadly, it's a shallow person with no backbone and poor taste in men.en's girlfriend as \\"the Italian.\\" Not her name, Nancy Dell'Olio. \\"The Italian,\\" like a character from a bad gothic novel.  <br /> <br />On the flip side, she seems to retain a bizarre adoration for her abusive ex-boyfriends, including one who kicked her in the head, and another who abandoned her with a newborn baby.

Independent of the first book \\"Over Sea Under Stone,\\" this is also darker, more magical, more intense, and one of the most beautifully written fantasy novels in existance.<br /><br />Will Stanton is an ordinary boy, until his Midwinter eleventh birthday. On that day, he ventures out into a seemingly changed world. There, he encounters a sinister Dark Rider, then a beautiful white horse that leads him to a hidden place, where he finds two of the Old Ones -- the mysterious Lady and Merriman Lyon, one of the stars of the previous book. The Old Ones are immortal, powerful, wise, and it turns out that Will is the last one born.<br /><br />And as an astonishingly cold winter settles over England, Will is taught some of the ways of the Old Ones, who fight the Dark (forces of evil, like the Dark Rider). He has one of the signs of power, but must get them all: Iron, Bronze, Stone, Wood, Fire and Water. And he must contend with the Dark Rider, his own failings, and a mysterious stranger whose future is inextricably entwined with his...<br /><br />Susan Cooper is at her peak here. Will Stanton's adventures have a sense of unreal mystery and magic about them, where the slightest actions can have significance, time is easily manipulated, and two kinds of reality intersect. Welsh mythos and legend is interwoven more deeply here, including hints of the Arthurian tilt that was featured more prominently in \\"Over Sea, Under Stone.\\" At the same time, Cooper accurately displays a more human side of Will, the side that is deeply attached to his family and home.<br /><br />Her writing also becomes much more detailed here. In her first Dark is Rising novel, Cooper's writing was relatively spare and lacking in detail. Here, she more than makes up for it with intricate details about the halls of the Old Ones, the bustling farmhouse, and the eerie woods where the Walker wanders.<br /><br />Nowhere to be found is the British-kids-on-holiday atmosphere. It's replaced by an warm atmosphere, and one of shocking, powerful magic. This isn't magic infringing on our world, but rather Will stepping from one to another. Her dialogue is more believable, even the little old lady bleating about the snowstorm; and Will tends to think, act, and talk like an eleven-year-old boy who is aged before his time.<br /><br />Will himself is an astonishingly three-dimensional character: he flips between being a smart, quiet eleven-year-old to being an Old One, with all the power that suggests. This transition is not one that is handled lightly, as he gradually loses his innocent, boyish outlook and learns more about the battle between evil and good. Merriman Lyon is a more majestic character than in \\"Over Sea, Under Stone,\\" and the reader gets a saddening view of the sacrifices he's had to make for his battle against the Dark.<br /><br />Susan Cooper does an astonishing job with \\"The Dark is Rising,\\" a spellbinding fantasy that secured the Dark is Rising Sequence as a classic.

Along with the crown, he wins the right to marry his pal's sister, Raederle, the second-most beautiful woman in the continent of An. But Morgan is stopped on his way by a shipwreck and news of something dark and sinister creeping into the lands. Strange shapeshifting creatures are entering the lands, the wizards have vanished from the land, and somehow the three stars on Morgan's brow are connected to their presence and how to stop them. He heads off to Erlenstar Mountain, to find the High One -- and finds more than he bargained for...<br /><br />\\"Heir of Sea And Fire\\" very slowly resolves the cliffhanger ending of \\"Riddle-Master,\\" focusing instead on Princess Raederle. The land-rule -- a sort of sixth sense given to kings -- of Hed has passed to Morgan's brother, meaning that apparently Morgan is dead -- but Raederle and her father don't believe it's true. She sets off with a few faithful friends, and encounters the semi-sinister harpist Deth, the shapechangers, armies of the dead rampaging through her father's lands -- and disturbing news about her and her heritage.<br /><br />\\"Harpist in the Wind\\" continues from the end of \\"Heir,\\" with Morgan and Raederle planning what to do next. Strange rebel armies -- of both the living and the dead -- are massing in Ymris, and Morgan is taking the dead armies to Hed in an attempt to protect it. Then he and Raederle set off to find the High One and wring some answers out of him -- only he may not be what they expect. As Morgan grows in power and gains knowledge about all of An, he strips bare the secrets of the High One, the shocking identity of the shapechangers, and begins a new age for the lands...<br /><br />There was never a less cliched author than Patricia McKillip -- the scope, majesty and richness of her invented world rival the best of the genre. Her plot twists and turns inside the lush, dreamlike prose that she's so good at, making a snowstorm as eerie as a magical showdown that can redefine an entire world's magic.<br /><br /> Her plot can be seen in two ways, as the growth of a naive young prince into a wise paragon of power, and also about the shifting of a land from one era into another. The Four Portions of An are a detailed, real-seeming fantasy world, and her princes, wizards, ghosts, and harpists are wise, sometimes sinister, mysterious and full of power.<br /><br />Morgan is an excellent hero, who is not arrogant or desirous of the power that he is gaining. As confused by his own destiny as by the events around him, he spends much of the first book resisting his fate. Raederle is an excellent counterpart to Morgan, afraid of her heritage and fiercely determined to follow him wherever he goes. They are not a perfect couple: they bicker and argue occasionally, but they do not allow divisions to sit and fester. Deth is the ultimate ambiguous character, keeping you guessing until the end about what the heck is going on with him.<br /><br />There are no elves, dwarves, fairies, gnomes, or similar fantastical creatures in this book. It came to me with a bit of a shock at the end that aside from the shapechangers, there were only humans in this -- humans who can learn magic, who make mistakes and who have to search for the truth instead of having it handed to them on a plate. The magic is startlingly eerie, subtle and pervasive rather than being flashy. Similarly, the shapechangers' menace isn't overdone -- much of their creepiness results from thequestion of what they are, and why they are doing what they do.<br /><br />The complexity and depth of McKillip's early trilogy is still striking today. Her rich invented world and haunting, complex tale of magic, wizards and riddles make \\"Riddle of Stars\\" (now republished as \\"The Riddlemaster Trilogy\\") a modern fantasy classic.question of what they are, and why they are doing what they do.<br /><br />The complexity and depth of McKillip's early trilogy is still striking today.

And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.<br /><br />Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).<br /><br />So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.<br /><br />Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" --  especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.<br /><br />The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but multidimensional and immensely interesting to read about.<br /><br />\\"The Hobbit\\" was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much.

So read this book, then scoop up \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and continue reading. A timeless treasure and classic.	2005-10-01

But he gets a bit lighter for \\"Anansi Boys,\\" a sort of unconnected sequel to his hit \\"American Gods.\\" You think your dad is embarrassing? Well, at least he's not a trickster god.<br /><br />Fat Charlie's dad has always been weird -- brass bands for the terminally ill, nicknames that stick, and much more. But even away from his dad, Charlie isn't happy. Then he gets the news that his dad died during a karaoke song; when he goes to the funeral, an old neighbor tells him that Daddy was really Anansi the spider god. Even worse, Charlie finds out he has a brother.<br /><br />Spider is everything Charlie isn't -- charming, debonair, witty, and magical. Soon he has not only taken over Fat Charlie's house, but his fiancee as well, distracting Fat Charlie from his boss's attempts to frame him. Determined to get rid of Spider, Fat Charlie enlists the Bird Woman's help -- but soon finds that his pact will only get them in deeper trouble with the ancient gods.<br /><br />Trickerster gods -- Anansi, Loki,  Kokopelli -- are always fun. And Gaiman makes the idea even more fun with \\"Anansi Boys.\\" Sibling rivalry forms the backbone of the book, but it's also sprinkled with corporate intrigue, romance, and the old Anansi legends (which Gaiman inserts periodically). And of course -- lots and lots of humour.<br /><br />With this lighter tone, Gaiman sounds a lot like his pal Terry Pratchett, right down to wry humor and comic timing. \\"There are three things, and three things only, that can lift the pain of mortality and ease the ravages of life. These things are wine, women and song.\\" \\"Curry's nice too.\\" Gaiman seems to be having a lot of fun in this book.<br /><br />And nowhere is the fun more clear than in Spider and Fat Charlie. They're like yin and yang, one charming, conscienceless and godly, while the other is nervy, awkward and mundane. Spider's charm leaps out from the page, while Fat Charlie is sort of Gaiman's \\"Charlie Brown.\\"<br /><br />Everyone gets annoyed by their siblings and embarrassed by their dad, but the \\"Anansi Boys\\" have a life more complex than most. Lighter than most Neil Gaiman books, but hilarious, dark and imaginative.e is sort of Gaiman's \\"Charlie Brown.\\" <br /> <br />Everyone gets annoyed by their siblings and embarrassed by their dad, but the \\"Anansi Boys\\" have a life more complex than most.

With her use of myth and folklore, rich language, and a time-spanning battle between good and evil, Cooper spins up a rare tale in her majestic prose.<br /><br />\\"Over Sea Under Stone\\" features the three Drew children coming to stay with Merriman Lyon. In his attic, they find an ancient treasure map that leads to a hidden grail -- if they can only figure out what the map's writing and symbols mean. But they are not the only ones who are looking for the grail -- three sinister people are in pursuit.<br /><br />\\"The Dark is Rising\\" shifts its focus elsewhere. On his eleventh birthday, young Will Stanton encounters the mysterious Merriman, and is told that he is the last of the immortal \\"Old Ones\\" who are fighting the forces of evil (known as the Dark). As the power of the Dark grows, Will must gather the six Signs that can help stop them -- and protect his friends and family from the Dark.<br /><br />\\"Greenwitch\\" brings the four young heroes together. Will and the three Drew kids are brought to Cornwall, where the grail has been stolen. Jane is haunted by nightmares about the Greenwitch, a symbolic weaving of branches and leaves cast into the sea, and a sinister artist captures Barney. But the Greenwitch is not just a tangle of sticks -- it's alive with wild magic that neither Old Ones nor the Dark can control.<br /><br />\\"Grey King\\" is the threat of the Dark. Will is recovering from an illness in Wales, where he meets a \\"raven boy\\" (an albino Welsh boy, Bran) and a dog with \\"eyes that see the wind\\" -- part of an old legend. Will must lead Bran into a closer connection with the Old Ones. But when an accident befalls the dog, Bran is angry with the Old Ones -- until the truth of his past comes to light.<br /><br />\\"Silver on the Tree\\" brings the series to a climax. Will receives visions of the past, and a message from Merriman that the final battle between the Dark and the Light is about to come. Evil creatures (minks, specifically) are swarming near his house -- and the Old Ones, while almost ready, don't have the power of the Lady. He teams up with the Drews and with Bran to find the Lost Land.<br /><br />Sure, fantasy incorporating old myth and legend is nothing new. People have been doing it for as long as the genre has existed. But Susan Cooper brings the idea of time-travelling immortals and ancient magic to life in this, with a hefty dose of adventure and tragedy.<br /><br />Cooper's writing is detailed and atmospheric, although the first book is much more plainly written than the following four. She can switch instantly from lighthearted to mystical and back again, and her writing is heavy with description. Moreover, she takes the folklore and legends of Britain and interweaves them with Arthurian legend, giving the whole Arthurian story a new spin.<br /><br />While some may not like the portrayal of good and evil as evenly matched, the strength of the Old Ones' determination is extremely invigorating. They're powerful, but still very human. And there are lessons carefully interwoven about good and evil, about loyalty, compassion, redemption, and friendship. These sentiments are never gooey, just powerful.<br /><br />The characters are overall quite good. Jane, Barney and Simon Drew are a little less endearing because they seem a little dated and similar. Will Stanton, however, has the sparkling quality of a truly classic character, a mixture of a wise ancient being and a preteen boy. Bran, as the heir of Arthur, is a fantastic accompaniment to Will. And Merriman looms over it all as the all-seeing Merriman, alternately forbidding and dignified or kindly and grandfatherly.<br /><br />With its majestic prose and entrancing, otherworldly characters, the \\"Dark is Rising Sequence\\" is a remarkable piece of work, and one that deserves many rereadings.

And Ranma Saotome has serious trouble with that in the seventeenth volume of Rumiko Takahashi's \\"Ranma 1/2,\\" where food is lethal and a certain creepy little man returns to the spotlight.<br /><br />Kendo crazie Kuno challenges Ranma to a seaside duel, but turns up with a watermelon on his head. Worse, he has amnesia. Ranma tries to cure Kuno's amnesia, but ends up with Kuno pursuing \\"the pig-tailed girl\\" with amorous intent. Now Ranma's trapped with Kuno on a deserted island full of watermelons... and Kuno doesn't understand the word \\"no.\\"<br /><br />Later, Ranma, Soun and Genma are all called to deal with the \\"Living Octopus Trap,\\" a jar that is wreaking havoc on a seaside village. Problem is, it has a very familiar little underwear weirdo inside. More problems arise when Happosai uses a magical pill that sticks him to Ranma's body, and creepy classmate Gosunkugi tries to win Akane's heart with magical paper dolls.<br /><br />Finally, Ukyo opens the legendary Sauce of Ten Years... and finds that it's toxic. Ten years ago, Ranma spilled it and hurriedly made a substitute. Now, feeling guilty, he offers to let the grieving Ukyo stay with them. Unfortunately, his relentless caring for his old pal/fiancee makes Akane miserable and jealous. And after an ill-fated attempt to convince Ukyo that he and Akane are already married, Ranma sets out to make Ukyo dump him...<br /><br />The biggest events of the seventeenth volume are Ukyo's okonomiyaki problems and Happosai's return. When we last saw the little underwear fetishist, he was being dropped into the ocean by Pantyhose Taro. Now he returns to Japan -- and his old ways, right down to getting Ranma beaten up by a gang of girls.<br /><br />And Ranma's romantic problems reach new climaxes. At first, he's in danger in being raped by Kuno. Then he's on a date with Gosunkugi (due to the magical paper dolls). Then he ends up in a love triangle with Akane and Ukyo, not sure how to make it up to Ukyo without making Akane mad. Add the fact that he keeps eating toxic sauce, and has a dream about having Kuno's babies, and you can see why the poor boy is stressed.<br /><br />And we get to see a new side of Akane in this volume -- the insecure side, which fears that he likes Ukyo better than her. It's very touching when she thinks to herself that they share a bond she can't understand. Out of her bedroom, of course, she gets jealous when she sees things like Ukyo wanting to scrub Ranma's back in the tub.<br /><br />Romantic troubles, nightmares, lethal sauce and dangerous watermelons make life difficult for poor Ranma Saotome.

In \\"The Age of Innocence,\\" Wharton took readers on a trip through the stuffy upper crust of 1870s New York, wrapped up in a hopeless love affair.<br /><br />Newland Archer, of a wealthy old New York family, has become engaged to pretty, naive May. But as he tries to get their wedding date moved up, he becomes acquainted with May's exotic cousin, Countess Olenska, who has returned home after dumping her cheating count husband. At first, the two are friends, but then they become something more.<br /><br />After Newland marries May, the attraction to the mysterious Countess and her free, unconventional life becomes even stronger. He starts to rebel in little ways, but he's still mired in a 100% conventional marriage, job and life. Will he become an outcast and go away with the beautiful countess, or will he stick with May and a safe, dull life?<br /><br />There's nothing too scandalous about \\"Age of Innocence\\" in a time when J.Lo acquires and discards boyfriends and husbands like old pantyhose. Probably it wasn't in the 1920s, when the book was first published. But this isn't a book to read if you appreciate sexiness and steam -- instead it's a social satire, a bittersweet romance, and a look at what happens when human beings lose all spontaneity and passion.<br /><br />Wharton brings old New York to life in this book -- opulent, beautiful, cultured, yet empty and kind of boring. It is \\"where the real thing was never said or done or even thought,\\" so tied up in tradition that nobody there really lives. And even though the unattainable countess is beautiful and sweet, it becomes obvious after awhile that Newland is actually in love with the idea of breaking out of his conventional life.<br /><br />Wharton's writing is a bit like a giant rosebud -- it takes forever to fully open. So don't be discouraged by the endless conversations about flowers, ballrooms and gloves. Wharton put them in to illustrate her point about New York at that time, and all the stories about different families, scandals and customs are actually very important.<br /><br />Newland seems like a rather boring person, since he only has brief bursts of individuality. But he gets more interesting when he struggles between his conscience and his longing for freedom. May is (suitably) pallid and a bit dull, while the Countess is alluringly mysterious and unconsciously rebellious. The fact that she doesn't TRY to rebel makes her far more interesting than Newland.<br /><br />\\"Age of Innocence\\" considered a story about a man in love with an unattainable woman, but it's also about that man straining against a stagnant, hypocritical society.

It's a gritty, dark, edgy series with several interwoven stories, and artwork that give no distraction from the rocky stories.<br /><br />It opens with \\"The Hard Goodbye,\\" a bloody revenge tale about a scarred hulk named Marv. He meets a beautiful young blonde who sleeps with him, but she is dead the next morning. Revenge spurs Marv to hunt down and destroy the people who killed Goldie, including a silent cannibal and a corrupt cardinal, no matter what the price.<br /><br />\\"A Dame To Kill For\\" is pure noir, set before the first book of the series. Dwight is a photographer with a shady past; his ex-girlfriend Ava reenters his life, announcing that she's scared of her ultrawealthy husband, Damien Lord, and seeking Dwight as a knight in tarnished armor. But Dwight doesn't know if he can trust her -- is Ava really in danger, or is she manipulating him as a pawn to get back at her husband? The truth just might destroy him...<br /><br />Elsewhere in Sin City, the streets of Old Town are ruled by the ladies who walk them. And in \\"The Big Fat Kill,\\" Dwight comes to their aid. A bunch of drunks invaded Old Town and get killed by the prostites... but then they find that one has a badge. Now Dwight must help the prostitutes -- to whom he owes a debt -- defend themselves against the rest of Sin City.<br /><br />\\"That Yellow Bastard\\" introduces us to Hartigan, an ailing cop who receives a distress call from an 11-year-old, Nancy Callahan. He does rescue her, but at a price -- the rapist-murderer who attacked her is the son of a senator. Hartigan ends up in jail. And after eight years, he finds that teen stripper Nancy is now being stalked by the senator's son again...<br /><br />Dwight returns in \\"Family Values,\\" arriving at an old diner and finding that someone shot up the place. Turns out an Old Town prostitute was murdered by a Mafia shooter, and now Dwight is on the warpath. Accompanying him is rollerblading ninja/assassin/prostitute Miho, as he works his way to the top of the powerful Mob...<br /><br />\\"Booze, Broads and Bullets\\" is a short story collection, full of little gritty vignettes. It provides little insights into the characters -- among other stories: Dwight rescues a beautiful mystery woman, Marv rescues a little girl from sex slavery, the lethal Delia lures in men for sinister purposes, and a pair of dumb crooks debate whether to steal a corpse's boots.<br /><br />\\"Hell and Back\\" is the end of the \\"Sin City\\" series... so far. It introduces us to Wallace, a shaggy artist who also happens to be a Vietnam veteran. He saves a stunning starlet named Esther, and goes out for a drink with her... only to be drugged and tricked by a mystery woman when he awakes. As he struggles to rescue Esther from her kidnappers, he discovers the gruesome reason they want her.<br /><br />Anyone who has seen the excellent \\"Sin City\\" movie will know what to expect -- a bloody, stark, lawless retro-noir story, with a lot of killing, sex and revenge. Wallace puts it well at the end of \\"Hell and Back\\": \\"That rotten town. Those it can't corrupt, it soils. Those it can't soil, it kills.\\"<br /><br />The artwork is usually stark black and white, with a few splashes of colour (lipstick, for example). It's stripped to the basics, with lots of nudity and blood. But the protagonists aren't black-and-white. Except for the rough but kindly Hartigan, they aren't really heroes, but a part of Sin City.<br /><br />Some of the stories are stronger than others -- \\"Family Values,\\" for example, is the weakest of these stories, just because it feels like it's been done before. And a few of the short stories fall flat. But the overall effect is a shocking, lingering one, and it's a credit that Miller can create such a complete mini-world in only seven volumes.<br /><br />The\\"Sin City\\" series is Frank Miller's opus, a horrifyingly realistic look at a metropolis that is all dark side.

Taylor struck out with his much-hyped debut, the tepid religious fantasy \\"Shadowmancer.\\" And the follow-up, \\"Wormwood,\\" is even less engaging than \\"Shadowmancer\\" was -- while it's fairly well written, it's loosely strung together with dull characters and a plodding plot.<br /><br />In the mid 1700s, London is gripped by panic -- somehow the earth is overspinning, and suddenly stops so that London is plunged into permanent night. A young servant girl, Agetta, is terrified of what is going to happen, especially because her master, Kabbalah master and scientist Dr Sabian Blake, is predicting that a comet called Wormwood will strike the earth.<br /><br />This information comes from the mysterious book, Nemorensis, that Blake was given by a stranger. The Nemorensis supposedly contains all the secrets of the universe. Unfortunately, the book also exerts a sinister influence over Agetta. But in an attic is Tegatus, an angelic being who might just be the savior London needs...<br /><br />Religious fantasy, or fantasy with religious undertones, is not a bad thing -- J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis and others allowed their religions to influence their life's work. But G.P. Taylor not only has the subtlety of a battering ram -- he's also quite boring. The story plods along in a string of little plot-related scenes, without building up much momentum.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems is the way Taylor handles the fantastical elements of his book. Okay, there are weird creatures. Most fantasy books have those. But his seem to just be thrown into the mix for no apparent reason. His handling of superstition and science in the 1700s is sketchy at best, no matter how brilliant a scientist Blake is meant to be.<br /><br />Taylor has a decent enough writing style, and he has a certain flair for description and atmosphere. But his style is also very repetitive and over-the-top -- where are the editors when you need them? What's worse, his idea of creating a fantasy world seems to be to just toss in a few weird elements that have nothing to do with the plot. The actual fantasy plot is just more of Taylor's lukewarm, generic Christian sentiments.<br /><br />The characters are as thin as the pages. There are a lot of characters for a relatively slim fantasy book, and many of them are left underdeveloped. Blake and Agetta are the only ones who receive any character development, and that isn't saying much. Agetta in particular seems almost manic, considering how fast her moods swing. Tegatus is just freakin' boring.<br /><br />G.P. Taylor strikes out again with \\"Wormwood,\\" another dull religious fantasy that leaves a sour taste in the mouth. Boring, messy, and not worth the effort it takes to wade through.dea of creating a fantasy world seems to be to just toss in a few weird elements that have nothing to do with the plot.

But first, he has to engage in a battle of wits -- and where Akane is concerned, Ranma might as well have none at all.<br /><br />As Ranma and Ryoga fight over a love letter at the baths, Shampoo shows up to taunt Akane with her new waterproof soap. But when the soap comes into Ryoga's possession, he finds that he no longer turns into a pig -- and wants to date Akane. Now the desperate Ranma not only wants to steal the soap from Ryoga -- but stop Ryoga's date with Akane.<br /><br />Then Ranma's ongoing fight with Happosai takes a nasty turn: the old lecher hits Ranma with strength-sapping moxibustion. Now Ranma is as weak as a baby, and his enemies are lining up to kill him. Even worse, the only cure for it is an old pressure-point chart... which Happosai stole a hundred years ago.<br /><br />With no other choice, Ranma leaves the dojo with his father. Akane is heartbroken -- until she finds that Ranma isn't running away. Instead, he's with ancient martial-artist Cologne, who is going to teach him her ultimate technique: the Heaven Blast of the Dragon...<br /><br />Expect a heavy dose of screwball comedy in this one, followed by a (gasp!) semi-serious story. And it even ends on a real cliffhanger, with none-too-bright Ryoga ready to break the weakened Ranma's neck. For a very funny misunderstanding. Takahashi balances out the comedy and seriousness perfectly, especially when Ranma is in serious physical danger.<br /><br />But first, of course, we get the romantic tangles of Ryoga, Shampoo, Akane and Ranma, with Akane stomping off in a snit to date Ryoga, and Ranma desperate to become all-guy at last. This is one of Takahashi's more chaotic romantic stories, and one of the funniest -- especially when Ryoga gets over-amorous with Akane, sending the poor girl running for her life.<br /><br />And once again, Ranma and Akane keep denying that they are attracted to each other at all. Their actions show what they really think -- the idea of Ryoga dating Akane sends Ranma into a frenzy; when Ranma vanishes, Akane gets depressed and goes after him (only to find him insulting her cooking).<br /><br />Will Ranma master the Heaven Blast before Ryoga snaps him in half?

There's nothing fantastical or pretty about the world she creates here -- it's gritty, dusty, raw and very dangerous.<br /><br />The action takes place on the planet of Austar IV, a miserable desert planet inhabited by drug-filled weeds, slave \\"bonders\\" and their masters, giant dragons, and deadly temperatures. The only real recreation is gambling on dragons who fight in the Pits.<br /><br />In \\"Dragon's Blood,\\" orphaned bonder Jakkin dreams of freedom, and has a secret plan to fill his bag with gold and free himself -- steal a new dragon hatchling and quietly raise it to fight in the pits. He finds an uncounted hatchling and spirits it away to the hills. But he soon learns that someone knows his secret -- the pretty Akki, an independent girl who is hiding an odd secret of her own. But even her help may not be enough to free Jakkin from slavery.<br /><br />By \\"Heart's Blood,\\" Jakkin has raised enough gold from Heart's Blood, and is now a free man and a dragon trainer. In theory, that is all he wants. But then he learns that Akki is in trouble, and becomes determined to save her, even though Heart's Blood has just hatched five babies. To help Akki, Jakkin will risk his life in the midst of bloodthirsty freedom fighters...<br /><br />\\"A Sending of Dragons\\" is the bittersweet third volume of this trilogy. Jakkin and Akka have been physically transformed, so that they can communicate with the dragons. Now they are on the run from ordinary humans, and end up running into a lost tribe of degenerate humans, who also are bonded with their dragons... dangerously.<br /><br />There aren't a lot of original dragon stories -- most are clones of Anne McCaffrey or J.R.R. Tolkien's works. Jane Yolen scratched all that, and creates an almost entirely new kind of dragon -- they're actually not the mythical creatures, but a type of alien lizards.<br /><br />She also crafts an intricate political system, with terrorists and shady senators, and a dusty desert world where everyone is descended from prisoners (it resembles Australia in many ways). Akki and Jakkin are brought to life in their sensitivity and strength, and Yolen's writing brings the dragons to life. They seem almost like real creatures, animal but close to human beings.<br /><br />With a fourth volume tentatively scheduled for 2006, it's about time to revisit the Pit Dragon Trilogy.

And young author Christopher Paolini got to the top of the heap with his bestselling debut \\"Eragon,\\" and again with the sequel \\"Eldest.\\" Are his fantasy novels really that good? Well... no.<br /><br />Paolini has raw, unrefined talent and an undeniable flair for writing, but he's bogged down by every fantasy cliche in the book. While there are distinct aftertastes of Tolkien, McCaffrey and Lucas, his first novel is an earnest light read, but his second much less so.<br /><br />\\"Eragon\\" is an impoverished lad living with his uncle in a secluded village, barely scraping by. That changes when he finds a strange blue stone in the woods. He tries to sell it, with no luck. Then it hatches into a baby dragon, Sephira. He raises her in secret until his farm is attacked and his uncle Garrow murdered by the evil minions of the ex-Dragonrider Galbatorix, who is now the evil king. Seeking revenge, Eragon gets the help of the old storyteller Brom, who is more than he seems.<br /><br />In the follow-up, \\"Eldest,\\" Eragon and Saphira are still finding their way. To learn what he must know to combat Galbatorix, Eragon will have to train in Ellesmera, among the Elves. Elsewhere, his cousin is still resisting their enemies, and leads the villagers on an escape. But soon Eragon will discover a shocking secret about his past, during a battle with Galbatorix.<br /><br />\\"Eragon\\" got massive attention when it was first published, especially since the \\"Harry Potter\\" series is winding down. With that much hype, it would be almost impossible for \\"Eldest\\" to work quite as well, especially since Paolini overloads it with too many political problems and awkward romantic moments. He really should have left the token love interests out.<br /><br />As a descriptive writer, Paolini shows distinct talent. He has a genuine flair for description of landscapes and places, right down to the raging storms and burned-out villages. His writing is still a bit raw, sometimes awkward, and the dialogue can border on pompous. But he has a solid ability to bring up what things look, smell, sound or feel like.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the writing cannot hide the two books' biggest flaw: there's virtually nothing original here. \\"Eragon\\" and \\"Eldest\\" often read like patchworks of other books and ideas. Young, clueless hero raised in the sticks? Check. Wise old man who teaches the hero? Check. Ancient sword? Dragons? Wise and fair elves? Evil wizard? Stumpy, grumpy dwarves? Check. It gets rather annoying, even if one tries to shut out the thoughts of \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"<br /><br />Paolini does know his dragons; Saphira is an amusing, often funny character. And Paolini adds dragon-riding details (like what scales do to a rider's legs) that most authors don't manage to. Eragon himself is a pretty typical fantasy hero, rather angsty and immature. He's likable at times, but still is not yet compelling.<br /><br />\\"Eragon\\" is a decent fantasy read, while \\"Eldest\\" suffers from a lack of forward momentum.

In a good way, that is.<br /><br />But in 2001, he embarked on a different kind of creative journey: Penning \\"Mirrormask,\\" a Carroll-ian fantasy movie, directed by book illustrator (and Gaiman collaborator) Dave McKean. While the movie isn't yet out, the screenplay is a lavish affair with concept art, photos and background information.<br /><br />Helena is a bored young girl in the circus, wanting a taste of real life. But then real life strikes: During a performance, her mother falls seriously ill and is hospitalized. Unhappy and directionless, Helena falls into another world -- a bizarre place full of masked people, griffins, orbiting giants and malevolent shadows.<br /><br />She is soon told by the Prime Minister that an evil princess (who resembles her) has stolen a magical charm, sending the Queen of that city into a coma -- and her city into chaos. With the comically mercenary Valentine at her side, Helena finds herself sent on a dangerous quest to find the charm -- the mysterious Mirrormask.<br /><br />Half of \\"Mirrormask\\"'s appeal is the eerie presentation, along with an archetypical heroine and opposing light/dark kingdoms. And it's a credit to both McKean and Gaiman that their screenplay is a good read on its own, letting eager fans know what to expect when the film finally sees the light of day.<br /><br />What sets \\"Mirrormask: The Illustrated Film Script\\" apart from most screenplays? The fact that Gaiman and McKean included storyboard pictures with the dialogue. It's not easy to visualize what's happening in a movie just by reading the script, and so the storyboard images let the readers follow the dialogue more easily.<br /><br />And of course: the photographs -- weird ones, usually patched together with surreal CGI, computer animation and wild makeup. Valentine's masklike face in particular is odd, but strangely convincing. There are even some behind-the-scenes photographs, including bluescreen shots and faux-aged pictures of anti-Helena.<br /><br />To add to the wealth of information, the correspondence between McKean and Gaiman about this film, abbreviations and grammatical errors intact. \\"Fantasy stories rely on cliche too much, fairy stories about fairies I think are pointless, fairy stories about the people who need to believe in fairies I think are fascinating,\\" McKean writes in one letter.<br /><br />\\"Mirrormask\\" seems to be what one would expect from a Gaiman creation: Weird, strange, and surreal, yet also funny and touching.

Heather Howard treads well-worn paths in \\"Chore Whore: Adventures of a Celebrity Personal Assistant,\\" but manages to add some wonderful comic flourishes to a rather loose storyline.<br /><br />Corki Brown is a hardworking widow, with a teenage son. She also works as a simultaneous \\"chore whore\\"/assistant/mommy to three different celebs: a sweet-natured star,  Jack-Nicholson-style lothario Jock Straupman, and bratty Lucy Bennett,. Corki's job: Do the messy, the urgent, and the bizarre, like going shopping for someone else's condoms.<br /><br />Then Lucy's personal and professional lives start to unravel. Her son starts causing trouble at school, while Jock's house is robbed of his \\"special\\" DVDs featuring trysts with underage girls, and Lucy becomes infatuated with a raging cowboy actor with a penchant for foursomes. Finally Jock and Lucy go too far -- worried mom Corki won't be used, abused, and taken for granted anymore.<br /><br />Celebrities need not sweat -- while dozens are name-dropped, Howard doesn't dish dirt with any names included. It's really not even clear that Jock and Lucy are based on just one person each. But it is obvious that Howard has based Corki's nightmarish experiences on her own -- picking up the underwear of a one-night stand, because the maid won't? Ew.<br /><br />Howard does a fairly good job with the comic elements of \\"Chore Whore,\\" upping the absurdity factor to the max. But the multiple storylines are only loosely connected, and it's sometimes hard to keep all the maids, celebs and amours straight. And the whole matter of Corki's husband being alive or dead is brought up, then dropped.<br /><br />But Howard does make some deeply likable characters, and she gives them a lot more depth than most \\"Devil Wore Prada\\" characters have. While we may despise Lucy and Jock, they have good points and human weaknesses. And while Howard never gets specific about why Corki's son is rebelling, she lets us see what happens when Corki has to play \\"Mom\\" to everyone except him.<br /><br />\\"Chore Whore\\" runs along the same track as other such books, but Howard does provide some humorously human foibles for her bosses-from-hell.

The best description I've heard yet is that it's a cancer of the soul. And of all the types, postpartum depression is perhaps the most neglected -- some people don't even know it exists, let alone how it should be treated.<br /><br />That is the heart of Brooke Shields' memoir \\"Down Came the Rain: My Journey Through Postpartum Depression.\\" This is not a glitzy showbiz autobiography, but a wrenching look at one woman's struggle to have a baby, and then to regain her own happiness.<br /><br />In 2001, Shields married producer/writer Chris Henchy, and soon they were trying for a baby. But because of cervical scarring, getting pregnant was difficult, and despite all the people prattling about adoption and relaxation, Shields and Henchy tried in vitro fertilization (IVF), and after a traumatic miscarriage, finally had a baby girl.<br /><br />But baby Rowan was less than a day old when Shields began feeling depression and anxiety attacks. Initially she chalked this up to the difficult C-section birth and the newness of the experience, but her feelings continued over the months that followed. Though she tried to tackle her postpartum depression by herself, the help of friends and the drug Paxil were what brought her back out of the pit.<br /><br />The first fifty pages of \\"Down Came the Rain\\" make it seem like this will be an up-and-down story, with generous amounts of self-deprecating humour. Shields lightens the mood with humour and a willingness to reveal her unflattering or goofy thoughts, such as thinking about those chest-bursting scenes from \\"Alien\\" during a C-section.<br /><br />But after that, a grimmer tone takes over the book. Shields' detailed descriptions of her torment, doubts and increasingly deteriorated life are almost harrowing, as well as her description of how she couldn't even connect with her newborn daughter. It's exhilarating when she finally beats the postpartum depression and relearns how to enjoy herself with her husband and child.<br /><br />An obvious motive is sprinkled through the story: Anyone who finds themselves in a similar position should get help, and get it right away. The afterword is basically devoted to that, and includes some phone numbers and websites to check out. Kudos to Shields for not keeping it just about her, but about all women with that problem.<br /><br />Perhaps the book is best summed up by the only two photographs of Shields. On the cover, we see her looking sad and lonely. But by the end of the book (specifically, the back flap), she's joyously kissing her smiling daughter.ughter.

Inexplicably, it turns out, because \\"The Starter Wife\\" is full of the vapid, name-dropping superficiality that any housewife from Nebraska could dream up.<br /><br />Gracie is a \\"Wife Of\\" -- wealthy, toned, dyed and perfectly preserved, and married to a Hollywood heavyweight with one kid. Until Kenny hits midlife crisis -- he dresses loudly, gets an earring, and then tells Gracie that he wants a divorce. In the dizzying whirlwind of divorce, Gracie finds out that he's having an affair with Britney Spears (presumably in the months before she started slumming it with Kevin Whatsisface).<br /><br />A concerned pal lends Gracie her Malibu house, so the newly-divorced can get her bearings and life back on track. And as she wanders the California beaches with her gay pal and married neurotic friend, Gracie finds herself desired by not just one but two men -- a handsome homeless man, and Kenny's dissatisfied has-it-all boss. Can she become more than Kenny's \\"starter wife\\"?<br /><br />Okay, it has a different plot -- one that Shar Jackson might find emotional satisfaction in, admittedly. But the core of \\"The Starter Wife\\" is yet another thin plot, with a moronic heroine and lots of name-dropping. It's even worse that much of Grazer's name-dropping is out of date -- since this book went to press, Brad and Jen have broken up. So no one's worried about them procreating.<br /><br />Grazer's lack of inspiration shows through in the storyline itself, which meanders aimlessly between Hollywood-expose cliches and middle-aged-woman-reinvents-self cliches. The writing meanders as well, as if the author is desperately trying to fill up space. Grazer even has the excruciating taste to name Gracie's gay pal \\"Will.\\" It's not witty or cute, just embarrassing.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest flaw is that Gracie -- the wronged Wife Of-turned-Starter Wife -- is a pill. Despite the men going gaga over her, the supposedly smart Gracie comes across as a bitter airhead, obsessed with age even when she's feeling good about herself. Kenny is a cliche of the Selfish Ex, while Will is a cliche of the Lovable Gay Pal. Only Lou, a tired mogul who wants to know what people really think of him, comes across as a real person.<br /><br />With more Hollywood tale-telling and absurd cliches, Gigi Levangie Grazer slumps even further in her sophomore effort. Sure it's just a fluff book, but it's really bad fluff.he supposedly smart Gracie comes across as a bitter airhead, obsessed with age even when she's feeling good about herself.

But when they do, they find themselves encountering a world that is just being created, by a strange lion -- the world of Narnia.<br /><br />The Narnia stories are getting more attention in the months before the movie is released. And though it's unknown whether \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" is going to be on the silver screen, it's a valuable read for movie-watchers and readers alike. Basically, if \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" raised any questions, then this can answer them.<br /><br />\\"The Magician's Nephew\\" serves as a neat way of explaining some very weird occurrances -- where did that lamppost come from? Or the Narnian humans? Just where did the White Witch come from, since she doesn't seem to fit in Narnia's springtime utopia? This book pretty much tells it all, as well as providing a character -- Digory -- who is a quiet but important presence fifty years later.<br /><br />But \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" isn't just a way of dealing with loose threads. It's also an entertaining story, full of strange magic and eerie dead worlds. But Lewis also includes some comedy, when Jadis is running amuck all over London, or when Narnian animals try to plant and water Uncle Andrew. Lewis does get a bit hamhanded with the allegory of Jadis and an apple, but the fast, tense storyline makes up for that.<br /><br />\\"The Magician's Nephew\\" is not just a prequel to the rest of the Narnia series, but an entertaining fantasy novel in its own right.

In \\"Favorite Novels and Stories,\\" London's most popular and well-known works are brought together in a boxed set.<br /><br />\\"Call of the Wind\\" is a surprisingly touching novella, about a strong dog named Buck. Buck is a beloved pet who is stolen from his California home by his owner's employee, to pay the thief's debts. He's sent to the Yukon, and soon discovers that mankind is the boss there, and among dogs it's survival of the fittest. And in Buck's soul is the \\"call of the wild,\\" which is slowly luring him away.<br /><br />\\"White Fang\\" is the flip side of that story -- it's the story of White Fang, a young wolf who is the only survivor of his litter. At first, the young wolf is a wild, untamed creature. But then he is captured by American Indians, then sold to a man who trains him to kill. Will White Fang be able to trust his only human friend?<br /><br />Then London changes his focus in \\"The Sea Wolf,\\" from animals to men who act like them. Pampered Humphrey Van Weyden never had to work in his life, but that changes when he is rescued by the Ghost, and forced to work as a cabin boy. Even worse, Captain Wolf Larsen is a monstrous man who possesses great strength -- and great brains.<br /><br />And finally there's \\"Five Great Short Stories,\\" which more or less focus on the same things -- action, adventure, and the wild beauty of the north. The exception is \\"The Mexican,\\" a story about a boxer that takes place in the southwest. London's writing is not quite as powerful in short story format, but still very strong.<br /><br />The literature of the early 1900s was often pretty genteel, with only a few exceptions. Jack London's fiction was wildly different -- it explored a region that few people went to, and gave them a window into a very different way of life. In fact, the same holds true for these novels today. (The only exception is the flat romance in \\"Sea Wolf\\").<br /><br />But their appeal is not just because the novels are different. London had a strong command of language and atmosphere, giving his books a richness that shows he was there, and he saw these things. He also was -- and remains -- one of the few authors who can convincingly get into an animal's head, with no cutesiness or sugarcoating.<br /><br />Jack London died in 1916, but his rough-edged, adventure-packed books are as fresh as if they written yesterday. A must-have collection of his best-known works.(The only exception is the flat romance in \\"Sea Wolf\\").  <br />  <br />But their appeal is not just because the novels are different.

But the Discworld series didn't start off on such good ground. In first Discworld novel \\"The Colour of Magic,\\" Pratchett lets his plot get away from him and meander over the edge of the Disc.<br /><br /> Discworld is a flat planet, balanced atop four elephants that stand on a giant turtle's back. And somewhere on that vast Disc is Rincewind the wizard -- cowardly, greedy, unlucky, a dropout and not very good at what he does. Enter Twoflower, a rather clueless tourist, and the Luggage, which walks around on hundreds of tiny legs.<br /><br /> Despite the fact that he doesn't want to, Rincewind is required to help the Discworld's first tourist ever (it's Twoflower, in case you're wondering). They're attacked by thieves, gamble with gods, encounter Death (who speaks ALL IN CAPITALS), and bumble through magical spells that can cause some major problems. But that isn't the biggest problem, when they encounter the very edge of the Disc...<br /><br /> \\"Colour of Magic\\" doesn't have much of a plot -- it basically has a long string of confusing, unhappy incidents that plague Rincewind, and it ends on an unsatisfying note. But at least the ride is fairly fun -- Pratchett spoofs the fantasy cliches with wink-nudge fervor.<br /><br /> Pratchett peppers his satirical little novel with lots of fun ideas, such as the quirky gods of Discworld and the dragon that vanishes if you stop believing in it. Unfortunately, the dialogue and writing aren't quite up to par. At times it's the delicious tone of British comedy, and sometimes it's so serious that it seems like Pratchett is writing an entirely different novel. Moreover, the plot meanders all over the place, as if he were making it up as he went.<br /><br /> Rincewind isn't a very engaging character in this volume -- we laugh at him, not with him. His constant efforts to keep himself alive are especially funny, since his luck is a mixture of bad (he always gets into trouble) and good (he always gets out of it). Twoflower is an amusing character, but the Luggage steals the show despite not being able to speak.<br /><br /> Fans of comic fantasy might enjoy \\"Colour of Magic,\\" but it's by far the weakest of Pratchett's many Discworld books. It was only in the succeeding books that Pratchett found his footing on the flat planet.ally funny, since his luck is a mixture of bad (he always gets into trouble) and good (he always gets out of it).

In a sea of snippy animals and dysfunctional families, Frank Cho's strip brought us something fresh and original: Complete madness.<br /><br />But in case readers weren't lucky enough to catch Cho's strip initially, it has been immortalized in \\"Liberty Meadows 1: Eden.\\" Expect nothing but madness, mayhem and a bit of wistful romance, and this kooky comic will not disappoint.<br /><br />Welcome to Liberty Meadows, an animal preserve overseen by vet Frank and animal shrink Brandy. Nerdy Frank is instantly smitten with busty, kind-natured Brandy, but lacks the self-confidence to ask her out. As he struggles to admit his feelings, he must get to know the residents.<br /><br />Unfortunately, those residents include a crazed cow, hypochondriac frog Leslie, chain-smoking chauvinist pig Dean, Truman the aquaphobic duck, and Ralph the tiny bear. This loony crew tries to deal with dates (where Brandy's crazed ex tries to kill Frank), the evil catfish Khan, camping trips with psychedelic mushrooms, falls into mine shafts, severed noses, truck-sized ticks, the insane stalker Cow kidnapping a celebrity and -- worst of all -- Dean's trip through the land of Cold Turkey.<br /><br />It's hard to find a comic strip that is as relentlessly weird as \\"Liberty Meadows,\\" and it's amazing that Frank Cho managed to keep these off-the-wall jokes going for so long. Or, for that matter, that he managed to make them up at all. Mad Cow kidnapping William Shatner? That one was priceless, I have to admit.<br /><br />Cho straddles the line between realistic and cartoonish artwork -- on one hand, Brandy and Frank are very realistic looking. Especially Brandy's, um, \\"details.\\" Their actions are all-too-human, and our hearts bleed whenever Frank's nerve fails him. On the other hand, the animals and some of the supporting humans are goofy-looking, and act accordingly.<br /><br />\\"Liberty Meadows\\" was a refreshing, too-brief reprieve on the comic page, and fortunately the stories of Brandy, Frank and the loony animals can be easily revisited in the first collection.fy-looking, and act accordingly.<br /><br />\\"Liberty Meadows\\" was a refreshing, too-brief reprieve on the comic page, and fortunately the stories of Brandy, Frank and the loony animals can be easily revisited in the first collection.	2005-09-11

He builds up a confusing if compelling storyline, only to have it spill into an unholy mess at the climax.<br /><br />Bret Easton Ellis wrote a gloriously nihilistic novel called \\"Less than Zero,\\" sparking off a bestselling career, drug addictions, and a hedonistic lifestyle. A few years later, he's wed to girlfriend Jayne, and living in dysfunctional tranquillity in the countryside with two kids. He's working on a new book, the perpetually pornographic \\"Teenage Pussy,\\" and still doing lots of drugs with pal Jay McInerney.<br /><br />Then weird things happen: A bird toy is killing animals. Bret's dad's grave appears. Monsters are invading his house. And a mysterious police inspector tells Bret that someone is emulating the gruesome murders from \\"American Psycho.\\" And as he tries to keep his family safe, Bret finds that his own fiction is what is spawning all this horror.<br /><br />\\"Lunar Park\\" is an intriguing self-exmination; I can only imagine what spurred Ellis to write it. It seems like an exorcism of the cynical, drug-dealing demons of excess that ran rampant throughout his novels. And in the world of \\"Lunar Park,\\" those novels -- especially the controversial \\"American Psycho\\" -- have an influence on the real world, whether it's bringing horrors to life or inspiring a serial killer. It's a fascinating look at fiction vs. reality.<br /><br />And despite the literary conceit of having himself as the lead character, Ellis' examination of his fiction is a thorough and brutal one. He even goes down to his writing style. The book opens with him looking back on his books, and noticing how the Spartan style of \\"Less Than Zero\\" evolved into babbly rambling. With this book, he's settled into a comfortable middle-of-the-road style.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Ellis also gets locked into a Stephen King fantasy, complete with a see-it-a-mile-away plot twist right out of \\"Rear Window.\\" He creates some genuinely chilling moments, such as when his alter ego starts seeing graves and monsters. But by turning all that good horror into self-examination, it loses most of its punch. And as the novel builds to its anticlimax, Ellis doesn't seem sure what to do with the plot threads he's woven together, like the disappearing boys.<br /><br />Metafiction runs wild in \\"Lunar Park,\\" a novel split between literary study and total horror. But Ellis seems to lose the grip on his plot, and it spins out of control like the book's events themselves.rtunately, Ellis also gets locked into a Stephen King fantasy, complete with a see-it-a-mile-away plot twist right out of \\"Rear Window.\\" He creates some genuinely chilling moments, such as when his alter ego starts seeing graves and monsters.

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

Lynn Schnurnberger and Janice Kaplan cornered the market on fortysomething chick-lit with \\"The Botox Diaries.\\" While they don't exactly have a sophomore slump in \\"Mine Are Sepectacular!,\\" a flaccid fiancee subplot keeps this novel from being so entertaining.<br /><br />Sara's first husband left her pregnant years ago. Now she's successful, engaged to hunky and wealthy Bradford, and on the verge of success in showbiz. She's also assisting her pals Berni and Kate: One is pregnant with twins at forty-three, while the other is having an affair with a married man, and refuses to admit that it's a bad idea.<br /><br />As if these weren't problems enough, Sara's ex turns up, as does Bradford's snotty, possessive ex-wife Mimi (who lives up to her name) and hostile teenage daughter. With her future starting to crumble, Sara has to figure out if they can blend their clashing families into one, and whether Bradford can handle her new glamorous profession.<br /><br />Kaplan and Schnurnberger have a talent for juggling multiple storylines, especially the ones applicable to fortysomething ladies: Second marriages, blended families, last-minute families, and winning over your new man's sullen teen. And, I might add, staying even somewhat sexy in the presence of constantly flirting soap hunks.<br /><br />And in this book, the most fascinating stories are that of Berni and Kate. Berni is a mom for the first time, after a massively successful career. Kate is STILL successful, but time has not given her wisdom, or hardened her sense of romance. Her romance with a Donald-Trump-like mogul is a disaster-in-the-making, one can tell.<br /><br />The problem, however, is Bradford. It's hard to imagine why Sara stays with this prissy twit, or why she puts up with his weird jealousies and hypocrises. Nor does it seem plausible that after staking a claim on Bradford and making every effort to seduce him back, Mimi would simply give up and turn up happily at the wedding.<br /><br />One third of the subplotting falls flat, but the stories about midlife babies and already-married romance are genuinely funny and poignant. And if Sara had eloped with the soap hunk, all three might have worked out.One third of the subplotting falls flat, but the stories about midlife babies and already-married romance are genuinely funny and poignant.

One of the more unique novels to come out of the literary underground is Richard Perez's \\"Losers' Club,\\" a captivating little novel about love, writing, clubs, and New York in the mid-90s. Gritty and edgy, it's also darkly funny (even hilarious). And in a peculiar way, very sweet and romantic.<br /><br />Martin Sierra is a lonely aspiring writer in a dull, uninspiring job. He's searching for a woman he can talk to, a friend as well as a lover. And he has met that woman -- and she is Nikki, a bisexual gal struggling through the end of a dying lesbian relationship. They hang around the glittering clubs and bars of New York's nightlife, perfectly in sync, except for Nikki's lingering sense of guilt that she shouldn't be growing so close to Marty.<br /><br />Marty's addiction to the personal ads reaps a pair of promising responses: Lola, full of rage and anger, and with a disturbing personal life; and Amaris, a gothic \\"creature of the night\\" with morbid interests (she once let a vampire gal suck her bleeding finger), and who has flings with the students she teaches. Martin's professional and personal life takes several strange twists, leading him to where he should have gone all along.<br /><br />The New York of \\"Losers' Club\\" is a stained semiprecious stone. A superficial glittering mass of bars and clubs, full of people who expect no more from it. The inhabitants are all at least a little loserish, but intriguingly so (say what you will about Amaris, she ain't boring!). Transsexuals, goths and vampires, angry artists, frustrated writers, guys on eighteen-inch-glow-in-the-dark platform shoes, and some people who just like to hang out and watch Andy Warhol flicks. Despite the downbeat title, this is a genuinely funny, witty book (the most hilarious part is the collection of ad replies that poor Marty wades through -- some stupid, some discouraging, and some that are just creepy).<br /><br />The newly restored edition is radically different from the original, however -- large chunks have been put back into the narrative, which takes away the stripped-down feel. But it gives it better flow and more insight into the characters, and in the end it's worth sacrificing the \\"minimalist\\" style. There's also some extras at the back: a book discussion club guide (\\"In what ways might the main character be perceived as a 'loser'?\\"), some related writings, and an intelligent interview with Perez sprinkled with literary references.<br /><br />Perez's writing and study of his characters is reminiscent of 80s writers like Jay McInerney (except sprinkled with some very nice poetry). Maybe Dave Sedaris on acid. But he's not so busy appealing to readers' sense of cool that he forgets to keep them emotionally involved. Flashbacks reveal Marty's past with his mentally-ill, abusive mother, whom he harbors a sort of sadness for. Little flashes of dialogue reveal a lot about the characters' souls, and what kind of people they are. (Like whether they believe in fate, or talk to tombstones.)<br /><br />It's hard not to like Marty. He aspires for something like happiness, and seems unable to reach it. But he is the sort who'll find it eventually. Nikki is a good balance of the realistic and idealistic -- while Marty sees her as all but perfect, we see she has doubts and insecurities too.

But he wasn't quite able to capture lightning in a bottle with \\"Spiral,\\" which takes away a large part of the visceral horror before giving readers a new kind.<br /><br />It begins where \\"Ring\\" left off, shortly after Ryuji dies. The coroner is his pal Ando, who is deeply disturbed when he finds a bit of paper stuck in Ryuji's torso -- with the coded word \\"Ring.\\" He's understandably intrigued, and begins exploring the details of the virus-like spread of the curse, and the ghostly Sadako.<br /><br />He also meets Mai, Ryuji's girlfriend. But soon Mai vanishes -- and then turns up dead. Even stranger, Ando finds that Mai saw the videotape and recently gave birth, but she was not pregnant the previous week. And soon he finds out that the Ring virus has entered its most lethal mutation: the rebirth of the undead Sadako.<br /><br />One of the trickiest things in horror literature is explain what makes it horrifying. Like an autopsy, Suzuki opens up the Ring virus and tells us what caused it and how it works on the body. It's fascinating. But it also saps away almost all the horror, to have the curse explained in such clinical terms.<br /><br />About halfway through \\"Spiral,\\" Suzuki seems to realize that he's losing the \\"horror\\" plot. So he then includes strange scurrying creatures, mind control, and the rebirth of Sadako. And as with \\"Ring,\\" Suzuki gives you the feeling that the apocalypse is about to hit -- it seems that it's just a matter of time until Sadako wins.<br /><br />Suzuki has both a good grasp of scientific horror and visceral creepiness. First he unravels the bizarre disease that causes the \\"curse,\\" then reveals the horrific effects of certain people watching the videotape. It's a credit to Suzuki's writing that it can be this good, considering how stilted the translation can be.<br /><br />Ando is a likable, if deeply flawed character. He's mourning the loss of his son and his marriage, and that gives him a pathos that many of Suzuki's other characters lack. Suzuki also uses him to revisit the question: Would you sacrifice the world's safety, if it saved the people you love? Since Suzuki is a father and child-care expert, he knows how many people would react.<br /><br />\\"Spiral\\" continues the story of the Ring virus and Sadako, but the first half is horror-and-suspense-free.

Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

In \\"The Age of Innocence,\\" Wharton took readers on a trip through the stuffy upper crust of 1870s New York, wrapped up in a hopeless love affair.<br /><br />Newland Archer, of a wealthy old New York family, has become engaged to pretty, naive May. But as he tries to get their wedding date moved up, he becomes acquainted with May's exotic cousin, Countess Olenska, who has returned home after dumping her cheating count husband. At first, the two are friends, but then they become something more.<br /><br />After Newland marries May, the attraction to the mysterious Countess and her free, unconventional life becomes even stronger. He starts to rebel in little ways, but he's still mired in a 100% conventional marriage, job and life. Will he become an outcast and go away with the beautiful countess, or will he stick with May and a safe, dull life?<br /><br />There's nothing too scandalous about \\"Age of Innocence\\" in a time when J.Lo acquires and discards boyfriends and husbands like old pantyhose. Probably it wasn't in the 1920s, when the book was first published. But this isn't a book to read if you appreciate sexiness and steam -- instead it's a social satire, a bittersweet romance, and a look at what happens when human beings lose all spontaneity and passion.<br /><br />Wharton brings old New York to life in this book -- opulent, beautiful, cultured, yet empty and kind of boring. It is \\"where the real thing was never said or done or even thought,\\" so tied up in tradition that nobody there really lives. And even though the unattainable countess is beautiful and sweet, it becomes obvious after awhile that Newland is actually in love with the idea of breaking out of his conventional life.<br /><br />Wharton's writing is a bit like a giant rosebud -- it takes forever to fully open. So don't be discouraged by the endless conversations about flowers, ballrooms and gloves. Wharton put them in to illustrate her point about New York at that time, and all the stories about different families, scandals and customs are actually very important.<br /><br />Newland seems like a rather boring person, since he only has brief bursts of individuality. But he gets more interesting when he struggles between his conscience and his longing for freedom. May is (suitably) pallid and a bit dull, while the Countess is alluringly mysterious and unconsciously rebellious. The fact that she doesn't TRY to rebel makes her far more interesting than Newland.<br /><br />\\"Age of Innocence\\" considered a story about a man in love with an unattainable woman, but it's also about that man straining against a stagnant, hypocritical society.

But he wasn't quite able to capture lightning in a bottle with \\"Spiral,\\" which takes away a large part of the visceral horror before giving readers a new kind.<br /><br />It begins where \\"Ring\\" left off, shortly after Ryuji dies. The coroner is his pal Ando, who is deeply disturbed when he finds a bit of paper stuck in Ryuji's torso -- with the coded word \\"Ring.\\" He's understandably intrigued, and begins exploring the details of the virus-like spread of the curse, and the ghostly Sadako.<br /><br />He also meets Mai, Ryuji's girlfriend. But soon Mai vanishes -- and then turns up dead. Even stranger, Ando finds that Mai saw the videotape and recently gave birth, but she was not pregnant the previous week. And soon he finds out that the Ring virus has entered its most lethal mutation: the rebirth of the undead Sadako.<br /><br />One of the trickiest things in horror literature is explain what makes it horrifying. Like an autopsy, Suzuki opens up the Ring virus and tells us what caused it and how it works on the body. It's fascinating. But it also saps away almost all the horror, to have the curse explained in such clinical terms.<br /><br />About halfway through \\"Spiral,\\" Suzuki seems to realize that he's losing the \\"horror\\" plot. So he then includes strange scurrying creatures, mind control, and the rebirth of Sadako. And as with \\"Ring,\\" Suzuki gives you the feeling that the apocalypse is about to hit -- it seems that it's just a matter of time until Sadako wins.<br /><br />Suzuki has both a good grasp of scientific horror and visceral creepiness. First he unravels the bizarre disease that causes the \\"curse,\\" then reveals the horrific effects of certain people watching the videotape. It's a credit to Suzuki's writing that it can be this good, considering how stilted the translation can be.<br /><br />Ando is a likable, if deeply flawed character. He's mourning the loss of his son and his marriage, and that gives him a pathos that many of Suzuki's other characters lack. Suzuki also uses him to revisit the question: Would you sacrifice the world's safety, if it saved the people you love? Since Suzuki is a father and child-care expert, he knows how many people would react.<br /><br />\\"Spiral\\" continues the story of the Ring virus and Sadako, but the first half is horror-and-suspense-free.

In \\"Good Wives,\\" the second half of the \\"Little Women\\" story (and the second part of an ongoing family saga), Alcott takes her little women out of teenage hijinks and into a darker, more adult place.<br /><br />The book opens with Meg March's wedding to John Brooke -- he's not the wealthy man of her dreams, but he is the man she loves. As Meg learns that it's a struggle to be a poor man's wife, her sisters Jo and Amy are stretching their own wings -- Amy is becoming an accomplished young artist, and Jo is letting \\"genius burn\\" as a published writer. Beth, who has never recovered from her bout of scarlet fever, is still a fragile homebody.<br /><br />Things take an unexpected turn when Aunt March invites Amy to go to Europe with her -- a trip Jo has wanted for years. To make things worse, Beth is in love with Laurie... but then Laurie proposes to Jo. When she rejects him, he storms away to Europe. Jo leaves as well, to be a governess and a writer in the city, but returns home to find Beth slowly wilting away. Tragedy, love and new life will bring the family back together in unexpected ways.<br /><br />It always hurts to grow up, and the events of \\"Good Wives\\" are no exception. It's a much more adult book than the first \\"Little Women,\\" with the girls finding out about love, marriage, careers, artistic attempts and the loss of loved ones. There's plenty of humor -- Jo's disastrous housecalls and Amy's equally disastrous dinner party -- but it's muted.<br /><br />Alcott's  writing, surprisingly, doesn't change much -- it's still funny, weird and highly detailed, but also full of sweetness and pathos. And while the book has some sad endings, the overall feel is that life goes on and things always turn out, if not happily, then for the best -- there are marriages, babies, and new beginnings for everyone. And it ends with a lead-in to the sequel, \\"Little Men,\\" with Jo and Professor Bhaer adopting a bunch of boys as unruly as Jo was.<br /><br />Jo is the same old Jo, with her foot in her mouth and her fierce independence. But she does become more mature and less prickly. Beth is almost a nonentity, wasting away until leaving the book altogether; Meg seems rather ditzy as a housewife, but apparently is shown as a Marmee-in-training. Amy does the best of all, becoming a vivid, funny character almost as likable as Jo.<br /><br />The second part of \\"Little Women\\" is \\"Good Wives\\" -- a very different kind of story about the March girls.

Alas, \\"Adored\\" is not really worthy of adoration -- it's sleazy rather than sexy, and tedious instead of titillating.<br /><br />The McMahon family is torn apart when megamogul Duke McMahon brings his new English mistress home -- Caroline, a gold-digger who tortures his long-suffering wife and adult kids. Even worse, she produces a baby as well. By the time Duke dies of a heart attack, his family is permanently split. They all go their separate ways, mostly hating each other.<br /><br />The one person unaffected by Caroline's arrival is Siena, Duke's granddaughter. Siena has been packed off to an English convent school, but loathes every second she's there. What she wants is to return to L.A. and become a megastar like Grandpa. But when she becomes ensnared by a forceful producer, she risks her life and career...<br /><br />There's very little to adore in \\"Adored.\\" It's basically about a dysfunctional family, who could exist in Hollywood, or anywhere else in the world. Name-dropping a few celebs does not a Hollywood story make. While it sounds promisingly trashy, it turns into an absurd Mary-Sue drama.<br /><br />Certainly Bagshawe's writing is nothing exceptional; it's purely beach-read quality, full of clinical sex scenes and people meditating on how much they loathe each other, or how much they want to be famous. It unfolds in a very predictable manner, especially when Siena meets the malignant Randall. Too bad Bagshawe couldn't throw her readership a few curve balls.<br /><br />What's more, she doesn't seem to be sure what kind of book to write -- the first third is all family drama. That seems promising, with all the dramatic hates and loves. Then suddenly we're switched over to the dull antics of Siena, without any real resolution to the family problems. There's no sense of fun or trashy voyeurism, just a stomach-turning study of ambition and narcissism. And that's from the HEROINE.<br /><br />It certainly doesn't help that Siena is such an arrogant, obnoxious little twerp that it's impossible to care what happens to her. To make us like her, Bagshawe puts her through the obligatory traumas, turning her into an arrogant, obnoxious little twerp with a facial scar. The supporting characters are all creepy, nasty and malicious, except for a few saintly paper dolls like Hunter and Claire.<br /><br />Like an adult version of \\"Gossip Girl,\\" Tilly Bagshawe's \\"Adored\\" is a paper-thin, sleazy look at the rich'n'famous, but with all the artistic merit of a third-rate soap opera.stomach-turning study of ambition and narcissism.

Taylor struck out with his much-hyped debut, the tepid religious fantasy \\"Shadowmancer.\\" And the follow-up, \\"Wormwood,\\" is even less engaging than \\"Shadowmancer\\" was -- while it's fairly well written, it's loosely strung together with dull characters and a plodding plot.<br /><br />In the mid 1700s, London is gripped by panic -- somehow the earth is overspinning, and suddenly stops so that London is plunged into permanent night. A young servant girl, Agetta, is terrified of what is going to happen, especially because her master, Kabbalah master and scientist Dr Sabian Blake, is predicting that a comet called Wormwood will strike the earth.<br /><br />This information comes from the mysterious book, Nemorensis, that Blake was given by a stranger. The Nemorensis supposedly contains all the secrets of the universe. Unfortunately, the book also exerts a sinister influence over Agetta. But in an attic is Tegatus, an angelic being who might just be the savior London needs...<br /><br />Religious fantasy, or fantasy with religious undertones, is not a bad thing -- J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis and others allowed their religions to influence their life's work. But G.P. Taylor not only has the subtlety of a battering ram -- he's also quite boring. The story plods along in a string of little plot-related scenes, without building up much momentum.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems is the way Taylor handles the fantastical elements of his book. Okay, there are weird creatures. Most fantasy books have those. But his seem to just be thrown into the mix for no apparent reason. His handling of superstition and science in the 1700s is sketchy at best, no matter how brilliant a scientist Blake is meant to be.<br /><br />Taylor has a decent enough writing style, and he has a certain flair for description and atmosphere. But his style is also very repetitive and over-the-top -- where are the editors when you need them? What's worse, his idea of creating a fantasy world seems to be to just toss in a few weird elements that have nothing to do with the plot. The actual fantasy plot is just more of Taylor's lukewarm, generic Christian sentiments.<br /><br />The characters are as thin as the pages. There are a lot of characters for a relatively slim fantasy book, and many of them are left underdeveloped. Blake and Agetta are the only ones who receive any character development, and that isn't saying much. Agetta in particular seems almost manic, considering how fast her moods swing. Tegatus is just freakin' boring.<br /><br />G.P. Taylor strikes out again with \\"Wormwood,\\" another dull religious fantasy that leaves a sour taste in the mouth.

Alcoholic genius. Brilliant musician. Jim Morrison died in 1971, but his legend still sits among us.<br /><br />With people who are brilliant and badly-behaved, as Morrison was, it's difficult to get a balanced view that seems like an actual person.  But James Riordan's \\"Break On Through: The Life and Death of Jim Morrison\\" manages to do just that.<br /><br />James Douglas Morrison was an army brat, intelligent and well-read, who began to blossom into a poet and musician in college. He went on to become the singer/frontman of the band \\"The Doors,\\" adding his outstanding poetry-like songwriting to his bandmates' equally outstanding musical skills. Soon they were a massively popular rock band.<br /><br />But Morrison had other facets as well: He was attracted to the bizarre, and could be cruel, sweet, loving, strange, and often drunken and loutish. He was also contradictory: He sought notice as a poet, but was still mainly known as a rock star; he slept around and handfasted a rock critic, but always stayed with girlfriend Pamela Courson. After living on the edge for years, Jim passed away in Paris, under strange circumstances.<br /><br />Most biographies of Jim Morrison err on one side or another. Either they portray him as a sadistic, drunken lout, or they show him as a transcendent gentleman. The truth isn't usually that simple, and neither was Morrison. And Riordan shows us the different sides of Morrison's personality -- good and bad, together.<br /><br />Like Morrison himself, the book has its contradictions: There is a somewhat fannish tone to the some of the writing. On the other hand, it's willing to acknowledge that Morrison could be lewd, weird, obnoxious and drunken. Riordan also shows us Jim's gradual flowering into a poet, his literary influences such as Nietszche, and the relationships between the Doors.<br /><br />Riordan also courts controversy by studying and dissecting the various theories about Morrison's death. Don't expect wacked out conspiracy theories, or medical improbabilities -- Riordan stays calm and rational throughout the whole thing, and reveals the most likely scenarios. He also avoids outright judgements on controversial figures like Patricia Kennealy.<br /><br />As the book draws to a close, Riordan keeps things dignified. He devotes the final chapters to studying the lives of Pamela Courson and the other Doors in the years following Morrison's death, as well as the creation of the \\"American Prayer\\" album. The only flaw is Kennealy's bizarre description of Morrison's \\"fetch,\\" which seems more fiction than fact.<br /><br />Jim Morrison's wild life and mysterious death are the stuff of which tabloid biographies are made.

No Dungeons & Dragons or Tolkien ripoffs here. Instead, a well-written, intelligent historical fantasy, which reportedly took Clarke a decade to write. With a story this rich, it was worth the wait.<br /><br />It's the early 19th century, in England. The Napoleanic wars threaten England, but that's not the only struggle going on. Magic is all but dead in England; the so-called magicians don't actually want to handle it, but want to leave it to old books and stories. Once the English magicians were powerful and respected, but now they just write boring essays about magic. Except for Mr. Norrell, a cautious little Yorkshire man who taught himself how to do magic.<br /><br />However, things take a twist when he gives his help in the battle against Napolean -- a new magician enters the scene, the enthusiastic and charming Jonathan Strange. The two magicians begin to work together, but things begin to go awry when Mr. Norrell realizes that Jonathan is attracted to all magic -- including the more dangerous varieties. He's increasingly fascinated by the legend of the Raven King, a changeling child who ruled Faerie and Earth...<br /><br />Historical fantasies have rarely been as detailed and rich as this one -- usually either the \\"historic\\" or the \\"fantasy\\" is abused. Often the best authors can do is write alternate universe stories where America lost the Revolution, the Roman Empire never fell, and so on. But Susanna Clarke shatters that with her richly-realized look at 19th-century Britain, with unique magic and a slight mythologic twist.<br /><br />Clarke keeps her writing solid, detailed and dignified, also footnoting extensively, with little wry winks and nudges to keep the book from being too serious. It does get tedious at times, and the finale gets a bit stretched out, but the positive far outweighs the negative. She has a flair for the historical parts of the book, keeping dates, battles, and political movement entwined in the plot. But she doesn't neglect the fantasy either; there's a mythic flavor in the story of the Raven King and the old magicians, reminiscent of old legends from ancient times. Her handling of magic is especially good -- less is more, and hints of past greatness make the magic all the more stunning.<br /><br />The title characters are the best of the book -- both are products of their times.

But all that changes in the twenty-eighth volume of \\"Ranma 1/2,\\" where our heroes battle colds, shape-changing, iron hair and evil cherry trees.<br /><br />A pig is savaging the young men of Tokyo, and at first Ranma suspects that Ryoga (who turns into a piglet) has finally snapped. But then the pig attacks Ryoga, and is defeated by him. Turns out that whoever defeats the pig wins the hand and heart of Akari, a pretty young girl who is obsessed with pigs -- and adores Ryoga. But when she accidently offends him, Ranma resorts to magical incense to bring them together... with bizarre results.<br /><br />More mayhem ensues when Ranma's father tries a new hair-grown remedy, resulting in spiky metallic hair that only grows when he's enraged. In an effort to tame Ranma, Miss Hinako uses fighting fish to stay in her adult form. A magical cherry tree possesses Kuno. And a magical spatula levels one of Ukyo's friends -- and then sticks to Ranma's fingers.<br /><br />But then Ranma catches a very contagious cold, which temporarily makes him unable to transform into a girl. It's the perfect opportunity to meet his mother, but Happosai and Genma promptly foul the whole thing up. Even worse, Ranma's mother catches a glimpse of her \\"manly\\" son... wearing a bra to entrap Happosai.<br /><br />Rumiko Takahashi balances out humor and pathos well in this volume -- on one hand we've got Hinako, Kuno and Ryoga, whose romantic luck finally changes for the better. One of the funniest moments is when Ranma uses magical incense on Ryoga, causing him to passionately hug anyone who says \\"pig.\\" On the other hand, we have poor Ranma's continuing efforts to meet his mother in his male form, even risking suicide to see her.<br /><br />Takahashi also introduces us to Akari, who looks a bit like Kagome from her \\"Inuyasha\\" series. She also happens to be Ryoga's soulmate, a girl who bolsters his fragile ego and thinks that he's perfect because he turns into a pig. Too bad Ryoga still has a thang for Akane, who hasn't got a clue that he adores her. And too bad Ryoga's hopeless sense of direction keeps him from meeting up with Akari...<br /><br />Romantic problems and familial difficulties torment Ranma and his pals in the twenty-eighth volume of \\"Ranma 1/2.\\" Only time (and Takahashi) will tell whether their problems will be dealt with....

Too bad he hates Ranma (\\"cross-dresser!\\"), Ryoga (\\"pig-boy\\") and all the other people -- and is doing his best to make life difficult for them.<br /><br />First, the Jusenkyo registry book is stolen. Then a mysterious cloaked man has somehow beaten up Mousse, Ryoga and Genma, and left them wrapped in pantyhose. Ryoga can only describe his attacker as \\"a demon.\\" Eventually the cloaked man attacks Ranma, and Ranma is winning -- until it starts to rain, and the man transforms into a sort of winged minotaur, and flies off with Akane.<br /><br />It turns out that the mystery cursee is trying to hunt down Happosai, for some weird past offenses. Ranma and Ryoga (in girl and pig form) manage to hitch a ride on the flying \\"demon,\\" to where he's keeping Akane captive. But the mysterious Pantyhose Taro has more than one trick up his sleeve, and five young martial artists may not be enough to stop him... unless Ranma gets crafty.<br /><br />Okay, the book actually starts off with a fluffy throwaway story about Ranma and a panda painting going on a date. But it's almost forgettable beside the excellent Pantyhose Taro story. He's a wonderfully warped character, who manages to singlehandedly irritate every major character in the Ranma series -- as well as actually LIKING his curse.<br /><br />Takahashi actually strikes a perfect balance between action and comedy in this story -- we have taut duels and mid-air battles between the cursed martial artists. Then we have Shampoo's (strategically placed) pantyhose, and the creative insults (\\"NYLON NAZI! PANTY PRINCESS!\\") Ranma lobs at Pantyhose Taro. The height of it would be Ranma and \\"P-chan\\" playing \\"Madonna and child.\\"<br /><br />Despite the fact that Pantyhose Taro is an obnoxious git, Takahashi does make you feel sorry for him -- being christened \\"Pantyhose Taro\\" by a little underwear sicko would be enough to make anyone nasty. And in a rare occurrance, we see Ranma, Ryoga, Shampoo, Akane and Mousse all working together for a common goal.<br /><br />Though Pantyhose Taro only made three appearances in the \\"Ranma 1/2\\" series, he definitely made a mark. Funny, action-packed and hugely entertaining.sicko would be enough to make anyone nasty.

Rumiko Takahashi wrote the sprawling martial-arts romance with plenty of jokes, goofy characters and misunderstandings.<br /><br />But in the 22nd volume of this series, Takahashi showed us the darker side of the Ranma story. There are plenty of funny moments, but it also has a very powerful and impressive opponent, some harrowing fight scenes, and what seems to be the death of a major character.<br /><br />Ranma finds his rivals Ryoga and Mousse, both savagely beaten by a pair of animalistic warriors. Ranma arrives just in time to see their cloaked leader mistreat Akane -- and during the fight, the dragon-woman Herb splashes Ranma with water. Herb is from the ancient Musk Dynasty, a tribe that took on the attributes of animals. And the water is from the Pail of Preservation -- and it locks Ranma in his female form.<br /><br />Ranma can regain his male form, but only if he gets the Water Pot of Liberation, which Herb is also searching for. So Ranma, Ryoga and Mousse (who want the pot for themselves) set out to defeat Herb and her bodyguards. But Herb is a more lethal opponent than Ranma has ever faced before -- and his own attacks don't work, especially when Herb's startling secret is revealed...<br /><br />Takahashi's more recent works -- such as the Inuyasha series -- rely more heavily on action and fantasy than the Ranma series did. And so the Musk Dynasty story seems almost like a warmup for Takahashi's later work, with its emphasis on gritty action, understated romance and lethal villains. Herb even looks a bit like her later villain Sesshomaru.<br /><br />Okay, there's still plenty of humour, such as the Musk warriors who are obsessed with women and breasts, or the way that Ryoga and Mousse keep distracting them (\\"Look at HER boobs!\\"). But the climax of the story is completely devoid of humour. Ranma is beaten to a pulp and almost decapitated, while Mousse and Ryoga battle the superhuman Lime and Mint and are nearly sealed in their pig and duck forms.<br /><br />Takahashi's artwork had also matured by this time -- it's very detailed, more lifelike and intricate, and there is a new maturity to the tempestuous Ranma/Akane attraction (\\"I guess... even if I can't be a man... I have to go back for her sake\\"). She had also mastered the art of the cliffhanger, since Ryoga seems to be dead near the end of one chapter.<br /><br />Ranma and Company deal with a new and frightening enemy in the 22nd volume of this series.

But Isabel Allende struck out in \\"City of the Beasts,\\" an excruciatingly dull, preachy, awkwardly written fantasy with some of the most obnoxious characters imaginable. While Allende is a talented writer of magical realism, straight-out fantasy seems beyond her.<br /><br />Alexander Cold's mother is suffering from cancer, and while she is in Texas for chemotherapy he is sent to stay with his grandmother Kate. Not only is Kate unstable and weird, but also is heading off on an expedition into the Amazon jungle to find a sort of jungle yeti called \\"the Beast.\\"<br /><br />Though initially disliking the expedition, Alexander befriends Nadia, the daughter of the guide, who teaches him about the wildlife and the natives of the Amazon. Alexander quickly falls in step with Nadia, learning all about his totem animal and magic. But soon they discover that the jungle and the mysterious \\"People of the Mist\\" are in danger of destruction -- by someone in their group.<br /><br />One of the worst things about this book is the fact that Allende seems to keep in mind constantly that she is writing for kids. A good book can be appreciated by adults and children alike. You don't have to dumb it down. But dumb it down she does -- she seems to think that not only is her audience young, but also too unintelligent to appreciate good literature.<br /><br />While Allende gives great care to her regular novels, here she seems sloppy, having her heroes magically develop powers whenever they are needed. For example, there's a language barrier between Alexander and the People. No problem -- he just \\"listens with his heart\\" and the language thing isn't a problem.<br /><br />Part of the book's dullness is the extreme detail that Allende throws in, apparently to show that she did her research. Enormous stretches are devoted to life on the Amazon, justifying ritual cannibalism and interbreeding polygamy. In other words, when she wants to lecture readers about piranha, expect the plot to grind to a halt. Unfortunately, that focus on detail also kills all sense of urgency -- when someone is murdered, the others don't get upset. Instead they argue about funerary rites.<br /><br />Moreover, Allende's attention seems to wander halfway through the book -- she seems to forget all about the \\"conspiracy\\" and Alexander's dying mother, only to yank up the plot threads a few hundred pages later. The backhistory of the mysterious \\"Beasts\\" is both boring and silly, as is the frantic conspiracy that Allende rigs up near the end.<br /><br />Alexander Cold is a ridiculously boring character, especially since halfway through the book, he sheds all his doubts and fears. Nadia is portrayed as a quirky, magical girl, but her New-Age preaching and preening make her seem like a mouthpiece. Kate comes across as abusive rather than strong, and the professor is so absurdly racist, sexist and boorish that he's impossible to take seriously. All \\"modern\\" people are evil or whiny, while the Indians are noble -- in other words, Allende opted to write cliches rather than characters.<br /><br />And most unforgivably: The preachiness. On every other page Allende reminds us how wonderful nature is, despite portraying the Amazon as a nightmare hole, and having a seemingly sympathetic character murder an animal to \\"set it free.\\"  She never makes us feel any awe or love for nature, or any real urgency to conserve the wild places of the world.<br /><br />The beauty of nature -- and human nature -- are lacking in \\"City of the Beasts,\\" a sloppy and poorly thought-out excuse for a fantasy.

The only people are the Chosen in their Castle, and the Icecarls who roam the icy lands.<br /><br />Such is the setting of Garth Nix's \\"The Seventh Tower,\\" which brings together the first three books in his Seventh Tower series -- lots of ice, lots of alien monsters, and the odd trip into a magical otherworld. It's a less complicated story than his works for older readers, but Nix's exceptional writing and a strong pair of lead characters make it a fascinating read.<br /><br />Tal is desperate -- his father is mysteriously missing, and his mother is terribly ill. The only way he can keep his family from being demoted to Underfolk is by getting a primary Sunstone, and using it to claim a Spiritshadow in the world of Aenir. But there seems to be a conspiracy against him, led by the malevolent Shadowmaster Sushin. Tal's only hope is to scale the Red Tower, and steal a Sunstone from the top.<br /><br />But his bad luck continues: a monstrous shadow-creature knocks him completely off the Castle, and Tal ends up lost in a snowy wasteland. He's found by the Icecarls, who aren't particularly pleased by his presence -- but after he fixes one of the Sunstones on their ships, they reluctantly send him back. Unfortunately, they're sending him back with the fierce Milla, who is just fine with letting Tal die.<br /><br />But though they manage to get back into the Castle, the two kids soon discover that they are in the midst of a hellish conspiracy that could kill them both -- or worse. And even when they manage to make their way into Aenir, Tal discovers that a mysterious force in the spirit-world needs his help.<br /><br />This series is aimed at a slightly younger crowd than Garth Nix's other series, like the Keys to the Kingdom series or his classic Old Kingdom trilogy. But though his writing is slightly simpler here, he still brings to life a vibrant, glowing world of ice and snow, glowing stones and shadowy monsters, elegant castles and fur-encrusted warriors that hunt sea-dwelling hulks.<br /><br />The first book is a bit slow-moving (despite the dramatic opening), mainly because Tal's attempts to get a Sunstone are a bit repetitive. But things really start picking up when Tal is captured by the Icecarls -- partly because after that, he has to deal with his enemies straight-on -- and Nix really has the chance to flesh out his world, with psychic Crones, land-whale Selski, serpentine glowing-horned Merwins and a half-shadow torturer. It's pretty wild.<br /><br />The most disappointing part of the story? This is only the first half of the series.<br /><br />Nix also conjures up two fairly likable heroes: Tal and Milla. Granted, they don't get along very well most of the time, but they complement each other well -- one is a desperate young boy who finds himself losing everything he believed in, while another is a fierce young warrior from a civilization that hates the Chosen's dependence on shadow-things. There are also some fun supporting characters, like the wickedly eccentric Ebbitt or the Storm Shepherds.<br /><br />\\"The Seventh Tower\\" brings together the first three books of Garth Nix's light-and-shadow-filled series, which starts slow but quickly packs in adventure and strange supernatural stuff.

Mix thoroughly, and heat to lukewarm. That's basically the recipe for vicar/author G.P. Taylor's debut novel \\"Shadowmancer,\\" a lame and limp semi-spiritual fantasy.<br /><br />Like many a fantasy villain, Obadiah Demurral wants to play God, and the corrupt vicar does so by trafficking with evil powers -- all-out sorcery and devil-worship. Enter Raphah, a mysterious man from Africa who is after a mystery amulet that will be incredibly destructive if evil people get their hands on it. (Wow, that's original)<br /><br />Are our heroes going to let Demurral and the forces of evil win? Of course not. Troubled teen Thomas Barrick (who has quasi-religious visions) and his pal Kate team up with Raphah to somehow keep Demurral from becoming king of the universe with the help of that amulet. But can our heroes win out against Pyratheon (read: the devil)?<br /><br />Original fantasy is hard to come by, and \\"Shadowmancer\\" doesn't improve the situation. It's your basic good vs. evil-forces-stirring-up-Armageddon story, with a heavy layer of religious allegory. Taylor manages to dredge up a few interesting mythical creatures, and a solid Yorkshire setting, but they're drowned out by the trite writing.<br /><br />No way is religious fantasy a bad thing in itself -- after all, C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien rooted their stories partly in religion. But Taylor's brand of Christianity is very watered-down, very generic, very politically-correct and VERY preachy. He lays this bland religious goo on so thickly that it's hard to read without feeling twitchy and uncomfortable. \\"Riathamus [God] stands at the door of your life and knocks. If you hear his call and answer him he will share your life and live with you always,\\" Raphah announces. It's like he's reading from a pamphlet.<br /><br />Nor can you expect much in the way of character development; everyone is a symbol rather than a person. Demurral is a cackling, mustache-twirling devil-worshiper. Saintly Raphah is as dull as the proverbial ditchwater, and so are the plucky kids who accompany him. There are no shades of grey here.

But don't expect an easy read in Barbara Victor's \\"Goddess\\" -- this one is less than divine.<br /><br />The book opens with Madonna preparing for her role in the musical \\"Evita,\\" based on the life of Eva Peron. This turned out to be the turning point of Madonna's life: It was in the period when she became pregnant, cleaned up her act somewhat, and made her first (and so far, only) acclaimed movie.<br /><br />Then it bobs back to the arrive of the immigrant Ciccone family in the United States, the early days of Madonna's parents, and the tragedies that her family never recovered from. From there, it tracks her as she became a struggling dancer, whose sexual dancepop became a massive hit. After a disastrous short marriage, many boyfriends (and girlfriends), a porn book, and an unfortunate movie career, she finally settled down with director Guy Richie to become the not-so-quintessential British wife and mother.<br /><br />Madonna is a bit of a love-her-or-hate-her person, especially since she has none of the warmth, stability or humour of similar pop stars like Deborah Harry. So it's not surprising that Victor's biography will probably inspire ire or delight in anyone who reads it... assuming they can get through it at all.<br /><br />There's a strange split in Victor's opinions on Madonna. She compares Madonna to the ancient virgin goddesses (huh?), and excuses much of her behavior. Then she ruthlessly shows Madonna's shallowness, sexual obsessiveness and arrogance. How? By the most damning evidence: her own words. Victor uses interview quotes, video footage, and even a behind-the-scenes special where she openly mocks and humiliates a childhood friend.<br /><br />There is some interesting information, such as analysis of Madonna's songs and music videos, although Victor (like Madonna herself) focuses way too much on the loss of her mother. And were Victor able to cobble together all this information into a straightforward biography, she might be a pretty good writer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Victor is actually a pretty bad writer. There's a lot of meaty information here, but no linear series of events. It's very distracting to jerk the readers from Madonna's toddlerhood to her adult career, sometimes in the same page. But that's what Victor does. Even worse, this choppy biography is laced with endless psychoanalyzation, and a tendency to demonize or beatify people as Madonna sees them, not as they actually are.<br /><br />Split adoration/disdain and a choppy narrative make \\"Goddess\\" a chore rather than a guilty pleasure, as a \\"scandalous\\" biography ought to be.

Because of the Harry Potter literary trend, there are a lot of \\"wizard school\\" books coming out. But Patricia McKillip turns that trend on its ear with \\"Od Magic,\\" the most intelligent and exquisite \\"wizard school\\" book yet written. Don't expect flashy magic and goofy antics -- this is pure magic from start to finish.<br /><br />Brendan Vetch has always had a way with plants, and that is why the ancient wizard Od asked him to come to her wizards' school in the city of Kelior. When Brendan journeys there, he finds that Kelior is ruled by a king who fears magic, and the cold-hearted wizard Valoren. Any magic they don't approve is immediately outlawed, and strict rules are wound around the wizards' school.<br /><br />As Brendan arrives, other things begin to happen --  rebellious Princess Sulys finds out that she's been betrothed to Valoren. A mysterious masked wizard and his ever-changing daughter arrive in the forbidden Twilight Quarter. And when Brendan's powers suddenly show themselves, he flees to a strange mountain -- where the most powerful magic of all is hiding.<br /><br />\\"Od Magic\\" follows the basic template of McKillip's past novels: Rich prose, primal and exquisite magic, and several storylines that don't seem to be connected, but come together by the end. And while that end seems a bit too easy, it's a glorious ride to finally get there.<br /><br />The wizards' school is only a setting for magic that many fantasy writers can only dream of -- a magical maze, a girl who does illusions, and the veiled wildness of the Twilight Quarter. McKillip's velvety prose softens up the royal intrigues, with smoke, mirrors, ribbons, word games and illusions. Calling it intoxicating isn't much of a stretch; writing this lush and dreamy is something you can get drunk on.<br /><br />There are a few flaws -- the stuff about the \\"faces of magic\\" comes in rather late in the story, and the ending seems rather sudden and a bit too neat. It's a relief from endings that cannot be understood, though. However, she'll keep you guessing about what's going to happen until the very last pages. She even harkens back to her classic Riddlemaster series, with those ancient magical shapeshifters.<br /><br />Though \\"Od Magic\\" has the odd flaws (od flaws?), Patricia McKillip's enchanting writing and imaginative story make this a thing of beauty.

Despite this, she captures the heart of school hottie Donald, and entertains Eileen's male admirers.<br /><br />But Linda finally gets tired of living under Eileen's heel, and discovers that her late father's books are still bringing in royalties. With those and his old car, she begins a career as a nature writer. But even this new level of independence can't prepare Linda for what happens when her best friend Marion loses an important competition -- and when Eileen leaves, and her true parentage is revealed.<br /><br />None of that plotline is really a problem, although it's glaringly obvious from the start that Eileen and Linda are not really sisters. While it's hardly an original plot, Linda's movements toward independence are a unusual and rather refreshing, even if she does talk out loud to herself a lot.<br /><br />The storylines about Eileen's engagement and Marion's attempts to become an architect are also fairly entertaining, and show the differences between the traditional parlor flower and career women. And as she did in \\"Girl of the Limberlost,\\" Stratton-Porter brings the wild places of California to life as Linda hunts for wildlife and plants in the hills.<br /><br />The problem? Racism. A subplot runs under the story of Donald and Linda, where a Japanese immigrant is outstripping Donald scholastically. Stratton-Porter repeatedly states that she considered this unacceptable. As a final insult, she has the immigrant cheating -- implying that not only did she think it's unacceptable, but impossible. I wonder what Ms. Stratton-Porter would think of international test results now.<br /><br />That racist current also ruins the portrait of Linda as an intelligent, mature young woman. Her rantings about Caucasian dominance are maddening, as is one scene where she gets creative with paints and \\"fashioned huge storm clouds wind driven, that floated in such a manner as to bring the merest suggestionof menacing faces, black faces, yellow faces, brown faces.\\" A few of the supporting characters like tragic Marion are interesting, but Linda's poisonous attitude pretty much wrecks it all.<br /><br />The bare bones hint at a fun \\"Cinderella\\" sort of novel, but Gene Stratton-Porter's vitriolic attitude corrodes it to the point where you can't even skim past the bad bits.as the immigrant cheating -- implying that not only did she think it's unacceptable, but impossible.

Books	4	5	5	N	N	Salterton drama	Robertson Davies excelled at creating deep, detailed stories about little communities and the strange things that happen in them.<br /><br />And his Salterton trilogy is no exception. These three loosely-intwertwined books -- &#34;Tempest Tost,&#34; &#34;Leaven of Malice&#34; and &#34;A Miixture Of Frailties&#34; -- take readers to the deceptively quaint Canadian city of Salterton, which is distinctive for having one university and two cathedrals. And while it's one of Davies' lighter works compared to his Deptford trilogy, this winding story still has a poignancy and cleverness that shows his skill with his odd characters.<br /><br />&#34;Tempest-Tost&#34; opens with the organization of an amateur production of Shakespeare's &#34;The Tempest.&#34; A motley crew of actors join it, including an exuberent professor, his quiet daughter, a quiet mama's boy, a beautiful rich girl, a womanizing soldier, and an infatuated schoolteacher. Love, ambition, jealousy and infatuation rapidly tangle together, climaxing in an unusually dramatic opening night.<br /><br />In contrast, &#34;Leaven of Malice&#34; is half satire and half mystery. The Salterton Bellman announces that Solly Bridgetower and Pearl Vambrace are engaged -- the only problem is that it isn't true. Professor Vambrace sees it as a personal affront, and sues the paper. Pearl and Solly are haunted by false rumors, reports, and claims about who faked the announcement. All they can do is try to find out themselves.<br /><br />&#34;Mixture of Frailties&#34; opens with the death of Solly's domineering mother. Her will leaves money to Solly's family only if he produces a male heir with his wife Veronica (previously known as Pearl); until then, her money is to be used in a trust for a young female artistic hopeful, who will go to Europe for a few years to study whatever she is good at. And finding the right girl is only the start of Solly's problems.<br /><br />The works of Robertson Davies tended to be introspective, complicated works that focus on a lot of oddball characters over long spans of time. But this is one of his lighter works -- sometimes it's outright comedic (there's a girl called &#34;The Torso&#34;), with &#34;Tempest Tost&#34; being the most charmingly funny of the three. It's also the least focused of the three, with &#34;Leaven of Malice&#34; and &#34;A Miixture Of Frailties&#34; being tighter, but a little more rarified in humor and a little more surreal in tone.<br /><br />It also has the rich, leather-chair-and-port prose that Davies excelled at, which feels like the halfway point between American casualness and the classic British style (&#34;Really, Solly, those Hansen relatives of yours are something special. Hollow legs, every one of them&#34;). And as the story drifts between different characters and themes, Davies deftly tackles the sins and oddities of a small community -- feuds, unrequited love, pranks and death.<br /><br />It also has a wide-ranging cast of characters, with Solly Bridgetower as the unacknowledged center of the trilogy. He's the kind of guy everyone knows -- fairly unimpressive, but a likable sort of guy when you get to know him. Pearl Vambrace and her irascible father also gain prominence in the loosely-linked stories, as a scandal and a reignited feud allow Pearl to break out of her old life and become her own person. And without a doubt, Humphrey Cobbler is Davies' best character -- a vivid, devil-may-care artistic genius who winks and nudges in every book.<br /><br />&#34;The Salterton Trilogy&#34; is often eclipsed by Davies' better-known Deptford Trilogy, but that doesn't mean it's bad. By no means. It's a pleasant and warmly amusing trio of interconnected stories, and due to be enjoyed by anyone who has read Davies' work.haracters over long spans of time.

Don't expect Helprin's more ethereal books of the past -- in \\"Freddy and Fredericka,\\" he just seems to be having fun.<br /><br />The Prince and Princess of Wales are stuck in a loveless marriage: Freddy is stodgy, pompous, scholarly, and tends to embarrass himself. Fredericka is sexy, blonde, ditzy, and loves discos. She is adored by everyone, while he consoles himself with his longtime mistress.  The media dislikes him for his \\"out-of-touchness,\\" but she can do no wrong in their eyes. Ladylike Queen Phillippa considers Fredericka a massive threat to the throne.<br /><br />But when Freddy ends up naked, tarred and feathered outside the palace, Phillipa decides that her son and daughter-in-law have embarrassed the royals once too often. She calls in the mysterious Mr. Neil, who sentences the bickering pair to conquer a rough new land: industrial New Jersey. Doing manual labor, parachuting, dealing with biker gangs and dental practices, Freddy and Fredericka begin to learn what real life is like -- and more about each other.<br /><br />Everyone except the British royal family knows what they need -- a swift kick of reality. So it's pretty fun to see a story about Di and Charles clones having to live like commoners for awhile, and so losing their absurd pretensions. Too bad this never happened in real-life, or the British royal family might be in better shape.<br /><br />It does tend to ramble on in the last quarter, and Helprin gets a bit too goofy with some of the names. Faintingchair? Okay, whatever. But Helprin's sense of humour is much sharper elsewhere: Parliament laughing over the \\"bosoms\\" tape, the \\"Fah Kew!\\" incident, and the duel with the bikers. Not to mention the hilarious duplicates of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, either quietly ineffectual or rigidly disdainful.<br /><br />But \\"Freddy and Fredericka\\" wouldn't be really good if it were all humour. As Freddy and Fredericka explore the U.S., even helping on a presidential campaign, they become a lot more likable and fun. It's touching to see the formerly un-loving couple begin to form genuine respect and liking for each other.<br /><br />Helprin has abandoned his more ethereal style for a robust, undignified kind of writing. It's still detailed and witty, but he seems to have loosened up. The one exception is the note of magical realism, Mr. Neil. He's ten thousand years old, knows of every English king in history, and works in a sex toy factory. Only a writer as talented as Helprin could make such a character work.<br /><br />We'll never know what would have happened if Di and Charles had been commanded to live incognito in New Jersey.

In particular, it focuses on a virtuous young Roman man, Glaucus, who is stuck in a love quadrangle with a beautiful, equally virtuous young lady, a blind slave girl, and a sinister Egyptian who beguiles the lovely young lady.<br /><br />In the background is a turmoil of religious and social problems, with a deadly volcano smoldering behind it all. Then, a murder is committed -- and Glaucus is arrested for the crime, and sentenced to be sent into the arena. When Vesuvius blows, will any of them survive?<br /><br />\\"The Last Days of Pompeii\\" is one of those novels that had immense promise. Unfortunately, Bulwer-Lytton turns it into a Roman soap opera. Rather than focusing on the more interesting aspects of Pompeii, Bulwer-Lytton decided to focus on a contrived romantic web of very boring people.<br /><br />It doesn't help that \\"Last Days of Pompeii\\" is also written in a chokingly dense style, very ornate and full of bad poetry. The dialogue is even worse, with lines like, \\"'With all his conceit and extravagance he is not so rich, I fancy, as he affects to be, and perhaps loves to save his amphorae better than his wit.\\" Okay, whatever. The story might be more palatable, had Bulwer-Lytton not tried too hard -- many Victorian authors managed to communicate their stories without smothering the readers in faux-ancient prose.<br /><br />Bulwer-Lytton also seems to have been showing off his knowledge of Roman architecture and clothing, since the descriptions of the atrium and triclinium are more complex than any character. He regularly interrupted the narrative just to lecture readers on historical trivia, on everything from medieval necromancy to Italian herbs -- not just annoying, but often irrelevant to the story at hand.<br /><br />Apparently in the interest of keeping the novel \\"human,\\" Bulwer-Lytton introduced some romantic tension. Unfortunately, his characters don't act like real people -- really, who would fuss about their love lives while escaping from an erupting volcano that has killed hundreds and destroyed two cities? It's hard to imagine anyone so oblivious and self-absorbed, but the annoying blind slave Nydia apparently can't think of anything else.<br /><br />Glaucus is a paragon of virtue, despite what Romans of the time were like; he even converts to Christianity for no apparent reason, in keeping with the attempt to make him fit the Victorian ideal. On the flipside, Arbaces is a rather cartoonish -- even slightly racist -- villain, who is just there to make trouble because he wants to.<br /><br />\\"The Last Days of Pompeii\\" is an intriguing idea for a novel, but a flop as Edward Bulwer-Lytton actually wrote it.

For fans such as that, there's \\"The Rough Guide to Lord of the Rings,\\" a little book full of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" facts, trivia, and basic outlines.<br /><br />After a series of movie stills, this extensive little guide plunges into the biography of J.R.R. Tolkien, studies of his family, his friendship with C.S. Lewis and the origins of his writings. The editors give detailed descriptions of each of Tolkien's novels, and authors (Stephen King, Ursula Le Guin, J.K. Rowling) who have been influenced by Tolkien.<br /><br />But they also break the rosy picture by including the comments about the books, ranging from obnoxious (Edward Wilson's blustering remarks about \\"juvenile balderdash\\") to adoring (W.H. Auden's \\"No fiction I have read in the last five years has given me more joy.\\" I knew there was a reason I liked Auden).<br /><br />Then the editors turn their attention to the late 1990s, when New Zealand director Peter Jackson began turning the wheels of a big-screen \\"Lord of the Rings\\" production. There's a study of Ralph Bakshi's disastrous cartoon, a biography of the director, movie legend Christopher Lee, and well-known trivia like how the cast got tattoos, or that Jackson got rugby fans to do Uruk-hai chants. Even a few tidbits of more obscure trivia come through, like Ian McKellen being begged by a fan not to let Gandalf wear \\"pointy boots.\\"<br /><br />But this isn't a movie guide: There are plenty of books that detail the movies. And so the editors switch tracks to include character bios, a humorous \\"travel guide\\" to Middle Earth, as well as one to New Zealand's \\"Rings\\" landmarks. Finally, there's a mixed condemnation/ad for various Tolkien merchandise, and even a subchapter about the history of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and rock music. Obviously there's Marc Bolan and Led Zeppelin, but also Marillion (originally \\"Silmarillion\\") and various mediocre metal bands. What IS it about metal bands and Tolkien?<br /><br />Overall, this is a good little book, packed full of good information and useful trivia bits. There are some \\"dead\\" moments in this book, where it seems like filler sidenotes have been included. I mean, really, what is up with that essay on \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and old westerns?

Sometimes she did dense, intense, longer poems that seemed to have been written a long time ago. \\"Ah, Love there is no fleeing from thy might,/No lonely place where thou hast never trod,/No desert thou hast left uncarpeted/With flowers that spring beneath thy perfect feet.\\"<br /><br />But some of her poems are more like songs: \\"I am not yours, not lost in you,/Not lost, altho' I long to be/Lost as a candle lit at noon,/Lost as a snow-flake in the sea.\\" In general, these ballads are much prettier and more accessable than the more intense and unstructured poems.<br /><br />It's a sad irony that Teasdale wrote mostly romantic poetry -- very, VERY romantic poetry -- yet she never had a successful romance in her short life. Maybe that is why so many of her poems have a touch of fantasy about them -- it's the sort of love that reality might not be able to stand up to.<br /><br />But she was obviously in love with love: \\"But oh, to him I loved/Who loved me not at all/I owe the little open gate/That led thru heaven's wall.\\" Imagine having that written to you, or at least given to illustrate the feelings.  Almost every poem in the eight books deals with romance, lovers, and how much she adored both.<br /><br />In fact, after awhile it gets a little tedious; it would get dull if she didn't occasionally write about other things (\\"Oh when God made Italy he was gay and young!\\"). However, Teasdale's love poetry is extremely beautiful and richly written, so that it's hard not to get dewy-eyed when reading them individually.<br /><br />Beautiful words and Italy are what \\"Rivers to the Sea\\" is made of. And Sara Teasdale's melancholy love poetry is definitely a must-read, for lovers of poetry, or just plain lovers.e it gets a little tedious; it would get dull if she didn't occasionally write about other things (\\"Oh when God made Italy he was gay and young!\\").

But the Discworld series didn't start off on such good ground. In first Discworld novel \\"The Colour of Magic,\\" Pratchett lets his plot get away from him and meander over the edge of the Disc.<br /><br /> Discworld is a flat planet, balanced atop four elephants that stand on a giant turtle's back. And somewhere on that vast Disc is Rincewind the wizard -- cowardly, greedy, unlucky, a dropout and not very good at what he does. Enter Twoflower, a rather clueless tourist, and the Luggage, a piece of walking, um, luggage which walks around on hundreds of tiny legs.<br /><br /> Despite the fact that he doesn't want to, Rincewind is required to help the Discworld's first tourist ever (it's Twoflower, in case you're wondering). They're attacked by thieves, have to gamble with gods, encounter Death (who speaks ALL IN CAPITALS), and bumble through magical spells that can cause some major problems. But that isn't the biggest problem, when they encounter the very edge of the Disc...<br /><br /> \\"Colour of Magic\\" doesn't have much of a plot -- it basically has a long string of confusing, unhappy incidents that plague the cowardly Rincewind, and it ends on an unsatisfying note. But at least the ride is fairly fun -- Pratchett spoofs the fantasy cliches with wink-nudge fervor.<br /><br />Pratchett peppers his satirical little novel with lots of fun ideas, such as the quirky gods of Discworld and the dragon that vanishes if you stop believing in it. Unfortunately, the dialogue and writing aren't quite up to par. At times it's the delicious tone of British comedy, and sometimes it's so serious that it seems like Pratchett is writing an entirely different novel.<br /><br /> Rincewind isn't a very engaging character in this volume -- we laugh at him, not with him. His constant efforts to keep himself alive are especially funny, since his luck is a mixture of bad (he always gets into trouble) and good (he always gets out of it). Twoflower is an amusing character, but the Luggage steals the show despite not being able to speak.<br /><br />Terry Pratchett's first Disc-book was moderately amusing. but it's by far the weakest of Pratchett's many Discworld books.

Having temporarily abandoned her melodramatic vampires, Atwater-Rhodes draws on the most popular works of Shakespeare and Laurell K. Hamilton. The result flies as well as a snake.<br /><br />Danica Shardae is the heir of the avian (bird) shapeshifter throne, which is at war with the serpiente (snake) race, and has been for many generations. After the death of one of the serpiente heirs, his sister Irene Cobriana appears at the Hawk's Keep to ask for peace talks in the land of the Mistari (tigers). Reluctantly, Danica's mother accepts.<br /><br />But when they arrive, the heir Zane Cobriana makes a strange offer to Danica: Peace can be achieved if they are married. (Or, as Atwater-Rhodes puts it, he chooses her as his naga and she chooses him as her alistair) Reluctantly, Danica agrees -- but her mother does not. As they plot secretly to wed when both are declared rulers of their people, strange assassins lurk in the shadows to somehow stop their marriage.<br /><br />It's never a good sign when a book has a glaring flaw on the first page. In this case, it's the use of the masculine name \\"Alasdair\\" -- the Celtic form of Alistair -- for a female character. Not a great way to start. And it's not the first flaw -- if not linguistically, then certainly plotwise.<br /><br />While Atwater-Rhodes has smoothed out some of the flaws of her earlier writing -- such as zooming fast to the finish -- it's still too self-conscious, too formulaic, and too lacking in real emotion. The revelations about the assassins (who act like four-year-olds) are awkward and stilted, as if she merely got tired of writing and wanted to finish quickly.<br /><br />\\"Hawksong\\" has a lot of the problems her previous books have: Supporting characters are paper-thin (the bodyguards, fussy in-laws, and flaky seamstress most notably). Everyone is gorgeous. Every nonhuman has some outstanding characteristic like weird eyes. Nobody falls in love because they want to, just because she feels the need to include a love story. All attractive men give off a sexy-danger vibe and move gracefully. And she spends a lot more time thinking about cool names for different stuff than she does making the characters worthwhile. (It wouldn't have detracted from the book if she hadn't fussed so much with all the different terms for a spouse)<br /><br />While Danica is thankfully not the tough-girl caricatures present in Atwater-Rhodes' last three books, she's pretty dull. She doesn't have much motivation to suddenly take mercy on Zane's brother, supposedly the defining moment of her characte; she never acts, only reacts. And Atwater-Rhodes doesn't let readers see into Zane's head, because he has no depth. He smolders and sizzles a lot, then turns into a tender, sensitive, ineffective wuss, much like the male leads of her prior books.<br /><br />While this stands above the prior books of Atwater-Rhodes, that's still shooting pretty low. \\"Hawksong\\" isn't so much an annoying mess as a flat, featureless, flavorless mass.cause they want to, just because she feels the need to include a love story.

Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.<br /><br />To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.<br /><br />Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...<br /><br />How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.<br /><br />Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.<br /><br />Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading.being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch.

Before Discworld was a gleam in Terry Pratchett's eye, the British fantasy author tried his hand at fantasy books for young adults. One of the results was the Johnny Maxwell Trilogy, three kooky sci-fantasy stories about time travel, aliens, and some very restless dead people.<br /><br />Most young boys enjoy video games. But in \\"Only You Can Save Mankind,\\" when Johnny Maxwell tries his pal Wobbler's new game, he finds that the aliens are... surrendering? Johnny is, unsurprisingly, quite taken aback: video game enemies are supposed to continue fighting. Then the game shows nothing but empty space. Johnny assumes that there is something odd about it, but nothing can prepare him for this: The ScreeWees are real aliens, who are attacked when someone uses the video game.<br /><br />\\"Johnny And the Dead\\" is an appropriate title for the second book -- because Johnny sees dead people. But a massive, mercenary, progress-obsessed corporation has just bought the graveyard for fivepence, and it will soon be razed for new construction. The only people more dismayed than the living inhabitants of Blackbury are the dead ones. So as the dead break their bonds to \\"unlive,\\" Johnny and his friends will try to save the graveyard from... a fate worse than death?<br /><br />\\"Johnny and the Bomb\\" rounds the trilogy off on a high note -- one of the smartest time travel stories around. Johnny and his friends are taking a homeless lady's trolley to a garage when he finds a new newspaper... from decades ago. Suddenly they're in 1941, Bigmac is arrested, and Wobbler left behind. When Johnny and the others return, they find that they have royally messed up the timeline...<br /><br />The Johnny Maxwell series is not Pratchett's best work, but it is an entertaining, witty fantasy trilogy. And Pratchett being Pratchett, he also gets to make fun of big corporations, radio programs, video games, war, and a lot of other stuff. Well, what else does one expect of a Pratchett fantasy novel?<br /><br />Okay, the first book is probably the weakest of the trilogy -- Pratchett's writing is definitely less mature, and the storyline is confusing, although still entertaining. The second and third volumes are where his tight plots and deft humor really bloom, such as when the dead Communist calls up a radio talk show host and speaks frankly about being \\"vertically challenged.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps the best part is the characters. Without other races like dwarves, golems and werewolves, Pratchett has to give the character entirely human quirks. Johnny is the \\"normal guy,\\" wise beyond his years and quiet unless he needs to speak. But backing him up is the dignified and intelligent Yo-less, gluttonous Bigmac, gutsy Kristy, and goofy Wobbler.<br /><br />The Johnny Maxwell Trilogy is a fun, wry, witty fantasy series, and show Pratchett slowly growing into his literary gifts.

Angela Bowie's \\"Backstage Passes: Life on the Wild Side With David Bowie\\" aspires to be witty and caustic, but ends up merely sounding bitter, without revealing anything really worth knowing.<br /><br />Bowie describes how she arrived on the music scene of the 1960s and met the budding singer David Bowie. After a very unconventional relationship, they married (he proposed by asking if she could deal with the fact that \\"I don't love you\\"?) into an open, bisexual union. A child, several albums and a drug addiction later, they split.<br /><br />A gag order was part of the divorce settlement between Angela Bowie and her ex husband; this book was published once the order ran out. Alas, there really isn't anything to justify the order. She is bitter -- nobody could mistake that. But aside from intimate rashes and lack of sexual prowess, she really has nothing too grubby to say about David Bowie. Bowie apparently contents herself with acid-flecked comments whenever she can manage it. There are jilted ladies of the rock world (Marianne Faithfull, Bebe Buell) who handle themselves with decorum, but apparently Bowie doesn't want to.<br /><br />The problem with Angela Bowie is that, like many paramours of rock stars, she assumes that she's a lot more interesting than she actually is. Her life is detailed, but not terribly interesting. What's worse, there's little contact with the intriguing people in the rock world. There's a spattering of stars like Mick Jagger who make real appearances (okay, we know Mick is a \\"billy goat\\" -- next shocking revelation!) and Michael Jackson, and others like Marianne Faithfull and John Lennon are mentioned but never really shown. Even Bowie's own ex-husband (the whole reason people read the book) is a nebulous presence.<br /><br />Bowie's writing wobbles dangerously, with plenty of rants and flash-forwards, as well as her opinions on the music industry. There's a lot of sex and drugs, but not much rock'n'roll. If you want to hear about the various people who wanted to sleep with both Bowies, Angela will tell you gladly. Same with the gender-bending clothes. Unfortunately, you won't be told nearly so much about his music.<br /><br />Readers may put down \\"Backstage Passes: Life on the Wild Side With David Bowie\\" wondering why the famed rock star bothered to put a gag order on Angel Bowie.

Gibbons' deft sense of humour and entertaining characters bring alive what could have been just another coming-of-age novel.<br /><br />Young Flora Poste unexpectedly finds herself orphaned, with only a tiny yearly allowance. But instead of getting a job and apartment, she decides to go live with relatives, so she can get life experience, tidy up, and make life nice and orderly. After a few vetos, Flora decides to go to Cold Comfort Farm, a \\"doomed house\\" whose inhabitants feel they owe a debt to her.<br /><br />When she arrives, she finds a clan of inbred Sussex hillbillies, including her grimly religious uncle, depressed aunt, \\"highly sexed\\" cousins, a very fertile farm girl, and the crazed matriarch, Aunt Ada Doom, who \\"saw something nasty in the woodshed.\\" Even worse, a pompous writer is infatuated with her. But Flora is determined to make things orderly, and so she begins changing Cold Comfort Farm...<br /><br />It takes a really good writer to straddle the line between spoofery and a serious book. Stella Gibbons was one such writer, and like Anita Loos, she was happy to eye everything humorously: the idle wealthy (Mary Smiling and her bra collection), people who live in squalor and hate it, but aren't willing to change (the Farm inhabitants), and even intellectuals (\\"Do you believe women have souls?\\"). Even the livestock gets funny names like Feckless, Graceless and Arsenic.<br /><br />For the most part, \\"Cold Comfort Farm\\" does seem orderly and tidy -- Flora drags it into the 20th century, sends people off to better lives, and arranges marriages, including one for her fey cousin to a young aristocrat. The only flaw is the ending: Gibbons never tells us what Flora's \\"rights\\" are, what Aunt Ada saw, or what happened with Flora's dad.<br /><br />At first, Flora comes across as rather manipulative and shallow. The odd thing is, as the book progresses, we see that Flora's liking for tidiness is essentially good-hearted. Like one of Jane Austen's heroines, she does these things not just for herself, but for their sakes as well -- she wants a \\"happily-ever-after\\" for everybody, including the mad matriarch, her womanizing cousin, and fire-and-brimstone uncle.<br /><br />While the ending of the book is not as tidy and orderly as I'd hoped, \\"Cold Comfort Farm\\" is still an entertainingly wry novel -- call it a comedy of improving manners.appened with Flora's dad.  <br />  <br />At first, Flora comes across as rather manipulative and shallow.

Fortunately Donald Zec does a solid job with \\"Sophia: An Intimate Biography,\\" a balanced, fair and non-drooling look at Loren's life and career.<br /><br />Sofia Scicolone was born to a commitmentphobic lothario and his latest girlfriend, a beautiful girl who looked like Greta Garbo. Unfortunately, he wasn't willing to marry her, so Sofia grew up with her mother's family. Plain and unhappy (she was sometimes called \\"stecchetto\\" -- little stick -- as a child), she grew up in the throes of World War II.<br /><br />But Sofia (renamed Sophia Loren) blossomed into a beauty, and later got jobs as a movie extra and a \\"fumetti\\" (comic) model. Soon her movie career boomed, pairing her with movie greats like Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant (who wanted to marry her) and Marcello Mastroianni. And despite being known as a sexpot, Sophia also established herself as a wonderful and versatile actress.<br /><br />Considering Loren's beauty, sex appeal and onetime scandalous involvement with husband Carlo Ponti, it would be too easy to make this a salacious tell-all. But Zec keeps it dignified -- no half-nude photos, no \\"battle of the bosoms,\\" no she-slept-with-everyone rumors. Instead we have Sophia dancing for joy at winning an Oscar, sobbing in \\"Two Women,\\" and posing with her sons.<br /><br />Zec also has a solid writing style, laid back and very relaxed. He also has a certain way with words: \\"... a girl raised midway between an armament factory and an erupting volcano is about as easy a pushover as a phial of nitroglycerine.\\"  He seems to like Loren as a person, which gives his analysis of her life a friendly tone.<br /><br />Zec also keeps an eye on the extended members of Loren's family, from her husband Carlo Ponti, her Garbo-lookalike mother, and her pretty younger sister. It even includes personal interviews between the author, Loren and family members, which shows a certain level of respect and reliability. This is not tabloid garbage, but a respectful look at Loren's life. And frankly, her life is reminiscent of a dramatic movie -- only it's for real, and larger than life.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest flaw is that it was written about thirty years ago, so it stops when Loren was only forty. But it's still a deeply insightful look at the woman who \\"makes films... and the best Spaghetti Vignole in Italy.\\"ch shows a certain level of respect and reliability.

Eight more marriages came after that, including George Sanders, Prince Frederick von Anhalt, and Conrad Hilton (yes, from THAT Hilton family). Not to mention a small army of lovers that included Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Frank Sinatra, and more.<br /><br />Gossipy memoirs are always a fun guilty pleasure, the sort of thing to tuck inside a weekly news magazine at lunch. Gabor reveals plenty of sexy details (including making out with Greta Garbo) that are above and beyond even what tabloids usually print, and she does in it a very straightforward, matter-of-fact manner.<br /><br />Unfortunately, her exploits start to get annoying. The word \\"diamond\\" is used constantly (we get it, Zsa Zsa -- you love diamonds), and there is little of Gabor's life except who she slept with and why. There isn't a great deal about her daughter or family... except when ex-hubby George Sanders married her sister Magda. Some of her stories are questionable -- like Sanders wanting to watch Gabor bed a Catholic priest, or Gabor sleeping with Sinatra to make him leave her apartment. And others raise weird questions (if she's so amazingly sexy, why did her husbands keep cheating?).<br /><br />Gabor gushes ad nauseam about her assorted lovers and husbands, few of which are actually around much. Initially, since her first lover was a god-king, it's an interesting tale. But when she gets to Hollywood, these guys mostly start to blur together. What's more, Gabor certainly was telling the truth when she said she liked being around men more than women -- her descriptions of women like Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly and any other beautiful heterosexual actress are pretty catty, to say the least.<br /><br />Zsa Zsa Gabor's autobiography starts off as a delicious gossipfest, but eventually deteriorates into a listing of the men she slept with and/or married. \\"One Life is Not Enough\\" is way more than enough.more than women -- her descriptions of women like Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly and any other beautiful heterosexual actress are pretty catty, to say the least.  <br /> <br />Zsa Zsa Gabor's autobiography starts off as a delicious gossipfest, but eventually deteriorates into a listing of the men she slept with and/or married. \\"One Life is Not Enough\\" is way more than enough.	2005-07-08

And while the old guard has passed away, many of their essays still live on. \\"J. R. R.

Tolkien.<br /><br />There are a few decent essays in here, where the writers seem to have genuine affection or appreciation for Tolkien and his works. Jane Chance Nitzche turns out a decent essay studying such aspects like Tolkien's \\"Christian king,\\" and the capable Humphrey Carpenter turns out a mini-bio of Tolkien, which seems to show where his characters and invented world came from..<br /><br />Unfortunately, the bad outnumber the good: We have Jared Lobdell scrabbling rather pitifully for books that bear a passing resemblance to \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" as does Randel Helms as he tries frantically to find a non-original source for Tolkien's orcs.

Just wait for the part where he claims that Frodo's attachment to the Ring is not an all-consuming addiction, but a sexual symbolism. He even gets basic facts wrong -- a line of the ent Treebeard's is attributed to \\"Fangorn,\\" the name of a forest.<br /><br />Nor do things improve with Burton Raffel's obnoxious work. Though he claims \\"it would be foolish to claim that Tolkien does not write well,\\" he then proceeds to tear apart virtually every aspect of Tolkien's writing -- insisting rather snobbily that Tolkien doesn't use enough description, and whining about his formal poetry. Evidently Raffel doesn't read enough pre-20th-century literature.<br /><br />Perhaps the worst sign is the foreword, in which the editor talks about his own dislike of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- in only about one page, the narrow-minded Harold Bloom manages to insult Tolkien and every person who has enjoyed his work.

Now he provides not only a novella in the world of the Abhorsen Trilogy, but several other short stories that he has penned over the years -- dark, chilling, beautiful and amusing.<br /><br />After the events of \\"Abhorsen,\\" Nicholas Sayre has decided that he wants to go to the Old Kingdom, to be near Sabriel and Lirael. Unfortunately, he gets sidetracked at a secret government base. Then a maddened official steals his blood to awaken a hideous Free Magic creature, which has lain dormant inside a clear case. Now the creature is on a rampage, seeking more blood to increase its power -- and Nicholas has no way to stop it.<br /><br />That novella, called \\"The Creature In the Case,\\" is the main draw for this collection of short stories. But it's also not the only one -- Nix includes several other stories: A pair of Arthurian stories, one about Nimue and the other about the Lady of the Lake; a man comes to the island of Lisden as its new owner... not knowing that he's been duped; and a young boy is enlisted by his grandfather to help save a forest from his greedy dad. Nix also shows off his more playful side in \\"Down to the Scud Corner,\\" a hilarious spoof of those \\"choose your own adventure\\" books.<br /><br />There are also darker stories in here as well. One story focuses on sex and death, as a young man tries to save the local girls from a lover who can call down lightning. And \\"Charlie Rabbit\\" is a surprisingly harrowing story about two boys hiding in a flooded building during a war. And the fairy-tale adaptation \\"Hansel's Eyes,\\" while not unusually dark, has a rather macabre ending.<br /><br />In all these stories, Garth Nix shows all his writing talents -- he's funny, he's chilling, and he's good at adventure stories and likable characters. It's wonderful to check out his earlier stories, and see how he has matured as a writer. But the main novella is perhaps the best of all, giving the underrated Nicholas a chance to shine. It also hints at possible future adventures for Sabriel, Lirael and their friends.<br /><br />The stories are not completely even, since Nix wrote them at different times in his life -- apparently some of his earliest work, including a story written when he was six, were not deemed worthy. But apparently he's had his rich, detailed writing style for a long time now, best evidenced by the internal monologue of the Lady of the Lake. While a few like \\"Lightning Bringer\\" feel rather underfleshed, most of his short stories feel satisfyingly complete on their own.<br /><br />\\"Across the Wall: A Tale of the Abhorsen and Other Stories\\" adds to Garth Nix's impressive list of dark fantasy.

While a few like \\"Lightning Bringer\\" feel rather underfleshed, most of his short stories feel satisfyingly complete on their own.     \\"Across the Wall: A Tale of the Abhorsen and Other Stories\\" adds to Garth Nix's impressive list of dark fantasy. This collection is well-worth reading, for some chilling, vivid storytelling.	2005-07-05

Unfortunately, \\"Snakecharm\\" falls just as flat on its face as her previous books, although in entirely different ways. It has promise for the future, but the most interesting person in the entire book is Zane's infant nephew.<br /><br />Serpiente Zane Cobriana and his avian mate Danica Shardae have been happily married for awhile, even if the union is making both snakes and birds uneasy. Things get even more tense when Danica faints during a ritual dance, and is found to be pregnant with a half snake, half hawk baby. Zane is initially pleased, but there's the nagging question of which kingdom the baby will rule -- especially when someone tries to kill Danica, and healing them means she will only have one.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a vicious, powerful falcon named Syfka has come to the serpiente city to find a renegade falcon, and she sows doubts in Zane's mind about whether the serpiente/avian alliance will last. Zane suspects that the renegade is someone in the Royal Flight that guards Danica, but the shapeshifting magic of the falcons means that it could be anyone. He has a choice -- find and turn in the renegade, or face destruction from the falcons.<br /><br />\\"Snakecharm\\" has a typical problem: the first three-fourths read as if Atwater-Rhodes was dragging her feet, trying to figure out how to deal with the problems she had brought up. Then slam-bang, she tacks in quickie answers to all of them. Unfortunately, as in her previous books, her plot twists are never explored, and the conflicts are usually fixed in a few pages.<br /><br />There are some interesting concepts, such as the falcon supremacy or the concept of the blended-race \\"Wyvern's Court.\\" Sadly, the falcons just become sneering, two-dimensional nasties and the Court is rapidly accepted by everybody, including Danica's narrow-minded mother. Everything falls into place easily and without dissention.<br /><br />Atwater-Rhodes focuses solely on politics this time around, and her writing is equally dull and pedestrian. Apparently she has abandoned the nuances of Anne Rice's writing, and what results is un-descriptive (except for hair and clothes) and lacking in feeling. The most poetic phrase in the entire book is \\"heir to the kingdom of moon and mountain.\\"<br /><br />Atwater-Rhodes has plenty of characters to develop, and leaves them all two-dimensional. All but a few falcons are sneering, arrogant and evil. Zane and Danica act like a couple who is at least in their mid-forties, rather than a pair of teenagers. Danica doesn't show much spunk until the ending, and Zane is the dullest, most passionless narrator that could have possibly been chosen.<br /><br />Amelia Atwater-Rhodes tries to grow up in her latest novel, but her writing is still blatantly, annoyingly immature. \\"Snakecharm\\" is proof positive that care and thought should be put into writing a novel.solely on politics this time around, and her writing is equally dull and pedestrian.

All messed up and no place to go.\\"<br /><br />That line sets the tone for \\"Bright Lights, Big City.\\" Jay McInerney's bestselling debut stands above other urban-angst novels of the time, which tended to go with shock value. Instead, McInerney experimented with second-person narratives and a vision of a fragmented, coke-dusted New York.<br /><br />\\"You\\" are a young man living in New York, and wife Amanda has recently left you for a French photographer she met on a modelling shoot. Understandably you are depressed and unhappy, and the loss of Amanda haunts your moods, especially when her lawyer urges you to sue her for \\"sexual abandonment,\\" even though you don't want a divorce.<br /><br />By day, you work in the fact-checking department of a prestigious magazine, where your malignant boss is getting tired of you. By night, you halfheartedly prowl clubs with your pal Tad, doing drugs and meeting women you care nothing for. Will you be able to move past your problems and become happy again?<br /><br />Consider that summary a little slice of what \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" sounds like -- the reader is the main character, which allows the reader to slip into another's skin for a brief time. Second-person narratives are often annoying, but McInerney's style is so starkly compelling that the little narrative trick pays off.<br /><br />The New York of \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" is basically a big, glitzy, hollow place, but still strangely appealing. And McInerney adds splinters of reality here and there, like the tattooed girl and Coma Baby, which add to the gritty you-are-there feel of the novel itself. His dark sense of humour comes out in \\"your\\" thoughts: \\"your\\" boss resembles \\"one of those ageless disciplinarians who believe that little boys are evil and little girls frivolous, that an idle mind is the devil's playground.\\"<br /><br />And while many trendy novels of the time relied on shock value and obnoxious characters, McInerney keeps it low-key. The young man is likable and sympathetic, despite his tendency towards self-pity. And the people around him -- the self-absorbed Amanda, likable Tad and nasty \\"Clingwrap\\" -- seem surprisingly realistic, as well as the minor people who flit in and out of our hero's vision.<br /><br />\\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" has gained a reputation as a trendy urban novel of the 1980s.

What that fails to note is that Nabokov, a Russian expatriate who spent many years in America, also wrote many other novels that were often even more groundbreaking than \\"Lolita.\\"<br /><br />Three of them were compiled into \\"Novels and Memoirs 1941-1951\\": the horrifying  political satire \\"Bend Sinister,\\" the entertainingly offbeat \\"Real Life of Sebastian Knight,\\" and the unique memoir \\"Speak Memory.\\" These three each demonstrate why Vladimir Nabokov was one of the best writers of the 20th century.<br /><br />\\"Bend Sinister\\" is the most obviously political of all the novels Nabokov wrote.<br /><br />It tells the story of Krug, a philosopher in the land of Padukgrad, who is dealing with the death of his wife, and having to raise his young son alone. To make things worse, an inept inventor's son named Paduk, has become the dictator. Worse, Krug is somehow in Paduk's way -- and Paduk will do anything to get Krug to endorse him. Literally, anything.<br /><br />\\"The Real Life of Sebastian Knight\\" has a lighter tone than \\"Bend Sinister,\\" with an unnamed narrator searching for clues about the true persona of his brother, Sebastian Knight, a famed writer. It ends up becoming a superb satire/detective story, looking at the faint traces that biographers snatch at, but which can only give a tiny look at the whole.<br /><br />\\"Speak Memory\\" is an entirely different kind of book -- it's all about Nabokov himself. He reexamines his colorful life, but not so much through basic experiences and facts. Instead, he looks at how he made sense of the world, whether as a privileged child, a man torn up by the Russian Revolution, and finally finding sanctuary in another land.<br /><br />It might come as a surprise that the famous \\"Lolita,\\" which caused such a scandal at the time, is actually one of Nabokov's less complex books. He dabbled in metafiction, existentialism, autobiography, and almost always in satire. And there are almost always layers on layers of meaning in his books -- these aren't the exception.<br /><br />His writing is dense, lush and detailed, and he seems almost to blur the line between fantasy and reality, especially since \\"Bend Sinister\\" takes little bits from various totalitarian governments. Even stranger, Krug apparently discovers that he is actually Nabokov's creation, and has an existential crisis. And Nabokov's self-examination is as fascinating as any bestselling novel, where he revisits those bizarre thoughts that we all have as children.<br /><br />A harrowing political thriller, an amusing satire, and an intriguing autobiography make up \\"Novels and Memoirs 1941-1951.\\" A writer like no other, and three books like no other.ction, existentialism, autobiography, and almost always in satire.

These people may be searching for love, for glory, for release, a burst of adrenaline in the desert, or for just a fling by the beach -- however, their problems and pasts will not go away.<br /><br />Eggers does occasionally dip into gimmickry, such as \\"There Are Some Things He Should Keep to Himself.\\" Don't expect much -- it's a few blank pages, which made me smile. But I feel a little cheated. He's at his best when he's unconsciously quirky, such as a cute conversation between God and the ocean in one short story.<br /><br />Eggers has done well in his past novel and memoir, but some of the themes of \\"How We Are Hungry\\" feel worn -- this man has a unique writing talent, but writers have to grow, and this writing doesn't show his mind or soul growing. The themes have not changed, and that lack of movement and growth makes it feel like he's just... stuck.<br /><br />That said, Eggers' writing is genuinely compelling and rich; in his rambly way, he's incredibly eloquent. His descriptions have a raw energy that can take your breath away, such as riding a horse in the desert. At the same time, he can wrap his characters in so much finely-drawn misery that it is difficult to not be moved by them. It's also the one area where Eggers stumbles -- despite the whimsy of the occasional \\"gimmick\\" story, the writing is dark and rather depressed. I'm not asking for sunshine and butterflies, but it lacks quips, wit and human insight.<br /><br />Those characters tend to feel like reflections of Eggers himself -- rather world-wear and melancholy. One woman, who climbs a legendary mountain in search of a purpose, is perhaps the richest character -- her inner thoughts are so real that they fly off the page. And she, like all the other characters, is hungry. Not for food, but to fill some emptiness inside that can't be named.<br /><br />Perhaps it's that inner hole that preoccupies Eggers' work, and the endless search is what keeps it from exploring the world. Despite a hint of stagnation, \\"How We Are Hungry\\" is a rich and engaging collection of stories. It leaves me wondering where -- if anywhere -- Eggers will go as a writer.ctions of Eggers himself -- rather world-wear and melancholy.

While there, Nadia and Alexander receive some ominous voodoo fortunetelling, which predicts that they will die if they are separated. Soon after, they encounter a European missionary who reveals that some of his brethren have vanished.<br /><br />So the gang sets out into the jungle in a plane -- only to suffer a crash landing. Stranded in the wilderness, they then learn that the missionaries are the captives of a ferocious military leader, who has also enslaved the native tribes. Now our heroes must singlehandedly set up their own \\"David and Goliath\\" fight, or face a horrific death.<br /><br />When the first book of this trilogy debuted, many readers were appalled at the sloppy storytelling that Allende had put into it. Apparently she doesn't think that younger readers will notice. Unfortunately, that sloppiness is still in her juvenile writing, making it seem that \\"Forest of the Pygmies\\" was dashed off over a long weekend.<br /><br />Deus ex machinae, preachy storytelling and absurd villains abound in this dull story. Unfortunately, \\"Forest of the Pygmies\\" is not just boring -- it's stretched as well. There doesn't seem to be enough plot for an entire book, so Allende fleshes it out with pseudo-mystical prattle, religious arguments and a bad acid trip.<br /><br />There's a faintly ridiculous quality to many of the things in this book, such as a scene where the missionary plays bullfighter with African wildlife, the adoration of the female sex, or the climactic \\"David and Goliath\\" duel. The evil enslaving villain is perhaps the silliest of all. It's not enough that he's evil -- he has to have a necklace of fingers too.<br /><br />It's also difficult to sympathize with know-it-all characters who suffer no serious doubts, struggles or difficulties. The smug, pseudo-mystical teenagers Alexander and Nadia are given convenient magic powers -- transformation, invisibility, speaking with animals -- whenever Allende gets them into a jam. They never get out of anything by brains or talent, only magic, and so it's difficult to care whether they succeed or not.<br /><br />Like the trilogy itself, \\"Forest of the Pygmies\\" ends on an awkward, sputtery note, with nothing of any note happening. Hopefully this will spell the end of Allende's ridiculous young adult novels.nough that he's evil -- he has to have a necklace of fingers too.  <br /> <br />It's also difficult to sympathize with know-it-all characters who suffer no serious doubts, struggles or difficulties.

The \\"Everyman's Library\\" brings together many of his best poems,<br /><br />Several of the poems included are well known ones that Stevens wrote, such as the atmospheric \\"Sunday Morning,\\" the vivid \\"Thirteen Ways of Looking At a Blackbird,\\" the whimsical and colorful \\"Emperor of Ice Cream\\" and a stretch of the epic \\"Man With the Blue Guitar.\\"<br /><br />However, lesser-known works by Stevens are also included, such as \\"Le Monacle De Mon Oncle\\" (\\"\\"Mother of heaven, regina of the clouds,/O sceptre of the sun, crown of the moon\\"), \\"Asides on the Oboe\\" and \\"Postcard From the Volcano.\\" These tend to be as good, if not even better, than Stevens' better-known works.<br /><br />The Everyman's Collection doesn't have everything Stevens did, but it does include bits here and there, from this book and that book, including posthumous publications. As a result, it's a good way to introduce oneself to Stevens' brand of lush, verbose poetry.<br /><br />This book also does a good job of showing the various kinds of poetry that Stevens wrote -- most are infused with color, sounds and smells, some with darkness, some with a rich overtone, some very brief like the bare \\"Anecdote of the Jar.\\"  One thing that Stevens' writing always has is beauty -- even in the weird ones. With only a few words he can evoke images that are exquisite, soothing, even eerie (\\"My candle burned alone in an immense valley\\"). He also infuses his poetry with intense colors and plenty of nature references, birds and trees, snow and rain and wind.<br /><br />Wallace Stevens' exquisite writing is some of the best the twentieth century had to offer, and the Everyman's Library collection is an excellent way to get into his work.	2005-07-03

Ulrika Jonsson is one of those celebrities mainly known on her own territory -- namely, the U.K. That gives American readers of her autobiography, \\"Honest,\\" a chance to take her as she is, without tabloids and rumors tainting it. Unfortunately, \\"Honest\\" as she is, the portrait she paints is not flattering at all.<br /><br />She was born into a troubled Swedish family that disintegrated, mainly because of her father's philandering -- a trait that she began copying when she got married. Though her husband forgave her, and they soon had a son, Ulrika dumped him in favor of a muscle-bound Gladiator.<br /><br />As this was going on, Ulrika's star was rising in the world, resulting in a weathergirl job, commercials, hostings and her own show. But she was in a series of bad relationships, with a crazed footballer, a cold-hearted German, and Britain's most famous coach. Then she found that her unborn daughter Bo had a serious heart defect that might kill her.<br /><br />The final eighth of the book is perhaps the most compelling -- Ulrika struggling to be a single mom, without emotional support, while her daughter is undergoing one surgery after another. Despite the lackluster prose of her biography, it's a moving story that gives the heartstrings a little tug.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the decisions that led her to that problem make Ulrika look dim and selfish. She apparently believes any absurd story she's told, such as \\"my ex-girlfriend lives with me, but only to houseclean.\\" And it's hard to sympathize with her string of disastrous relationships, when she dumped a sweet, tender, loving Mr. Right so she could play the field with Bad Boys. Ulrika repeatedly tries to justify her infidelity by claiming that she couldn't help it -- that it was inevitable. Uh-huh, sure.<br /><br />Ulrika also has the disturbing tendency to dehumanize anyone she doesn't like -- she refers to an abusive ex as \\"Mr. C\\" for a long while, and later disdainfully refers to her lover Sven's girlfriend as \\"the Italian.\\" Not her name, Nancy Dell'Olio. \\"The Italian,\\" like a character from a bad gothic novel.<br /><br />On the flip side, she seems to retain a bizarre adoration for her abusive ex-boyfriends, including one who kicked her in the head, and another who abandoned her with a newborn baby. Additionally, there's a near-obsession with her children. At one point, she flips out because she might have to spend a week or two away from her son.<br /><br />While the story about her critically ill daughter is a winner, the rest of Ulrika's story is a string of grating affairs -- affairs that a smarter woman would have avoided. \\"Honest\\" makes Ulrika seem like a real person... but sadly, it's a shallow person with no backbone and poor taste in men.Dell'Olio. \\"The Italian,\\" like a character from a bad gothic novel.

As she and a junior Crone infiltrate the entryways, trying to get airweed, they encounter Free Shadows -- which are killed by the ancient Talon she acquired earlier. But when she rejoins the Freefolk, Milla finds that they have a traitor in their midst.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Tal is struggling to find the Empress so he can tell her of the conspiracy. But after a harrowing trip to Aenir, Tal finally finds her -- a doddering old woman with no real power to stop the evil Sushin. But then Tal discovers the creature that is manipulating Sushin -- and his own destiny.<br /><br />Garth Nix packs a lot of story into six slim books, and managed a fully realized fantasy world to boot. Not many authors can create as good a fantasy series in dozens of books. \\"Into Battle\\" has one weakness, but is otherwise a magnificent buildup to the series' climax.<br /><br />\\"Into Battle\\" also introduces us to the Big Bad Guy, Sharrakor. Not personally, but this is the first we hear of him; it's a little jarring to have the sinister Sushin suddenly replaced as a top bad guy, this close to the end. Fortunately, Nix does sustain the sense of ominous mystery that this series has always had.<br /><br />And when he introduces us to the doddering empress and her equally doddering brother, Nix also hints at what's in Tal's future in this series, if he defeats Sushin and Sharrakor. Milla has already gained her destiny, and we see her as a humbler, more self-assured warrior.<br /><br />\\"Into Battle\\" is a strong buildup to the final book of the Seventh Tower series, and proves again that Garth Nix has mastered the dark fantasy novel.asy novel.	2005-06-30

But during the procedure, Joel revisits the good times they had together, and finds that he doesn't want to lose his memories with Clementine.<br /><br />This movie, by Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman, was one of the best of 2004, and one that isn't quickly forgotten. The screenplay is an excellent accompaniment; if there is a line or an image that didn't seem to make sense, it might make more sense here. \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" fans will also like the scenes that never made it to the final cut, and one scene got shuffled around.<br /><br />Additionally, there is an interview at the end with Kaufman. In it, he describes his writing background, his collaborations with Gondry, clashes with Ben Affleck's horrific \\"Paycheck,\\" memory, and that wonderful \\"Velveteen Rabbit\\" scene. Although, it could have used more of Kaufman's thoughts on the final product and the actors.<br /><br />The stumbling blocks? Don't try reading the screenplay BEFORE seeing the movie, or you will be hopelessly lost. The script cuts wildly from the past, the present, inside and outside the characters' heads. It works wonderfully on the screen, but on paper it's hard to visualize just by the words alone.

One of the early fantasy writers, Dunsany only wrote a few full-length novels -- one of which was the haunting, beautifully-written \\"Charwoman's Shadow,\\" a story that slips into the grey place between good and evil.<br /><br />Ramon Alonzo is a young Spanish nobleman sent to find a dowry for his sister Mirandola. He goes to a powerful magician to learn alchemy -- how to turn dross into gold. The magician agrees, at a price: Ramon Alonzo's shadow. At first he's inclined to give up his shadow, but an elderly charwoman warns him not to. She gave up her shadow, and now is shunned by everyone except the magician because if her contact with dark magic.<br /><br />Eventually Ramon Alonzo agrees to give up his shadow in exchange for a replacement, which turns out to be a dud. His attempts at magic for his sister's sake begin to go horribly wrong, and he finds his very soul in peril as he struggles to fulfil his promise to the charwoman, and get back both of their shadows.<br /><br />Most of Dunsany's fantasy stories are set in fictional lands full of magic and wizards and gods. This one is slightly different, as it is set in a sort of semi-fictional part of Spain, and magic is something which leads to evil. But the plot in this book has the same sort of otherworldly edge that his more fantastical works do. (Although if any Harry Potter fans think that Rowling created the \\"philosopher's stone,\\" they'll be sadly disappointed)<br /><br />It has a straightforward plot, which is made more elaborate by his flowery prose. Dunsany was one of those writers who dwelled on the more beautiful details of his stories, and as a result, \\"Charwoman's Shadow\\" has the feeling of a dream. Especially in scenes where really strange things happen, like the charwoman scrubbing a bloodstained floor stone, or Ramon Alonzo's fake shadow getting up and racing away.<br /><br />Ramon Alonzo is a good hero -- he's a nice guy who gets enmeshed in bad things for good reasons. The charwoman Anemone herself remains a mystery for most of the book, although one development is rather obvious early on. And the other two characters show the good vs. evil struggle: Father Joseph, a kindly priest, and the cold, cruel magician who  \\"scorns salvation\\" and shows no pity to someone he's wronged.<br /><br />\\"The Charwoman's Shadow\\" is not only an early fantasy novel, but also an exquisite little story of love, magic and kindness.

Tolkien worked until the end of his life on Middle-Earth, with its elves, hobbits, dwarves, human Men, and mythical kingdoms and lands. Of course, he produced the epic classics \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" and the posthumous \\"Silmarillion,\\" but that was only after massive rewritings, notes and revisions.<br /><br />After his death, his son Christopher Tolkien did the world an enormous favour. He scraped together all of Daddy's notes and letters, annotated them extensively, and published them as the History of Middle Earth. \\"The History of the Lord of the Rings\\" goes a little further -- it shows us how the classic story evolved, the characters changed, and how all those steps were needed.<br /><br />The earlier drafts of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" were dramatically different from the book we know and love. Aragorn was once a hobbit called Trotter, Frodo was called Bingo and was once Bilbo's son rather than his cousin. Frodo ended the series as a reknowned warrior, and Treebeard was a bad guy. Things like the palantir were added into the storyline as it progressed. Scenes were changed, lines were crossed out, and subplots were added.<br /><br />\\"The History of the Lord of the Rings\\" also lets readers in on something else: The process of book-writing. Many writers just let the story guide them, and Tolkien was one of those -- his story was practically alive, changing itself as he wrote it. As a result, he had to keep going back to change things, and inventing subplots to keep the main plot going. It might have driven a lesser writer crazy.<br /><br />As outlined by Christopher Tolkien, we see J.R.R. Tolkien painstakingly revising, reworking, and adjusting his opus, until it finally worked out into the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" we know and love today. At times Christopher Tolkien takes it too far by rambling about his father's notes and revisions. But Tolkien's old notes speak for themselves.<br /><br />Perhaps the most rewarding part of this set is the slim \\"End of the Third Age,\\" which contains the last revisions and notes for \\"Return of the King.\\" At the end of it is the epilogue, which for some reason was cut out of the final book. In it, we get to see Sam and his loving family several years later, when peace and prosperity have returned to the Shire.<br /><br />\\"The History of the Lord of the Rings\\" is a rewarding read for fans of the original book, and for those who want an inside look on the writing process. It's a necessity, to fully appreciate the plot of \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"slim \\"End of the Third Age,\\" which contains the last revisions and notes for \\"Return of the King.\\" At the end of it is the epilogue, which for some reason was cut out of the final book.

Though fans of the dapper magician might be disappointed that he is a supporting character, the title \\"Conrad's Fate\\" indicates who is the star of this twisty, hilarious fantasy.<br /><br />Conrad Tesdinic has always been told by his creepy Uncle Alfred that he has bad karma -- apparently he failed to kill someone in a previous life, and will die in a year unless he kills them now. So Conrad finds himself being shipped off to the castle of Stallery, as a servant, to find the person he has to kill. Joining him is Christopher, a smart boy who seems able to work magic, yet doesn't know what a chili pepper is.<br /><br />Christopher eventually tells Conrad that he is a nine-lived magician, and has run away from his own world to find his friend Millie, who has also run away. She's somewhere in the castle, but he can't find her. Peculiar behavior from the count and his family, a troupe of actors, and strange shifts in reality are plaguing Stallery, and Conrad soon finds that he may have more than bad karma to worry about.<br /><br />Diana Wynne-Jones' most popular fantasy series is the Chrestomanci one, which predated the Harry Potter series with its organizational magic and twinkly British humor. It's complex, funny and more than a little strange, and fans of \\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" will enjoy seeing old favorites -- like Millie and Gabriel -- returning to Jones' writing.<br /><br />Fans of Chrestomanci/Christopher Chant may be slightly disappointed by his secondary role. But then again, the book IS called \\"Conrad's Fate,\\" so it's hardly surprising that the narrator is Conrad. Conrad himself is a likable kid, with bad luck and a pleasant personality, but who is also plagued by spells and lies from the people around him. And Christopher is showing signs of the dapper, intelligent magician he later becomes.<br /><br />The last parts of the book become somewhat confusing, with several intertangled plotlines, only to have Jones suddenly snap them taut. It's a credit to her that she is able to have a shifting castle, runaway magicians, a knitting witch, a gold-digger, faux nobility and an assassination plot all come to a head simultaneously. And her dialogue (\\"You pear-shaped freak!\\") shows that her sense of humor has not dulled with time.<br /><br />At the end of \\"Conrad's Fate,\\" it's hard not to wonder what is going to happen next in the series. Fortunately, in the meantime, this book is a delightful fantasy mystery.arts of the book become somewhat confusing, with several intertangled plotlines, only to have Jones suddenly snap them taut.

Most vamps are now either goofy, ugly bloodsuckers or sultry lace-and-velvet sophisticates. But in \\"The Historian,\\" Elizabeth Kostova creates the smartest vampire novel in many years. It may drag at times, but it has a wealth of historical detail and creepy atmosphere.<br /><br />It begins in 1972, with a young girl exploring her father's library. On a high shelf, she finds a strange book with a dragon on it, and a packet of old letters from 1930, that begin with, \\"My dear and unfortunate successor, it is with regret that I imagine you, whoever you are, reading this account I must put down here...\\". When she asks her father about it, he reluctantly tells her a strange story from decades before.<br /><br />In his youth, her dad was an enthusiastic scholar. But all that changed when he learned from a mysteriously vanished teacher that an ancient tyrant was mysteriously still alive -- Vlad Tepes, the basis for the vampire Dracula. Now in the rational 20th century, gruesome deaths and ancient clues lead the young woman across the world. She must figure out whether Vlad Drakula is dead, or undead.<br /><br />In a sense, \\"The Historian\\" really doesn't belong in the twenty-first (or even the twentieth) century. It's all set in the early 1970s, but it feels more like Kostova is writing in a 19th century setting, with the slow pace, verbal formality and intense detail typical of older books. In other words, don't expect fountains of gore or plenty of vampire cameos.<br /><br />\\"The Historian\\" does have a tendency to drag, with Kostova focusing on some of the more mundane details of the heroine's life. There's much wandering from monasteries to mosques, dusty libraries to campuses. Some of it adds to the plot, and some of it doesn't. However, she does make up for this with some genuinely creepy atmosphere, and an understated sense of horror. The climactic encounter is a scene that could have been kitschy or goofy, but Kostova manages to make it into pure, quiet horror.<br /><br />Moreover, \\"The Historian\\" balances out modern rationality with ancient superstition. Kostova has done her research; she includes various historical accounts of Vlad Tepes and his atrocities, as well as the Ottoman Empire and the rich cultures of the medieval Middle East. Rather than inventing a \\"vampire mythology,\\" a la Anne Rice, she uses actual history as backstory. And to be honest, the real-life atrocities Vlad committed make Stoker's vampire seem almost tame.<br /><br />With dusty books, yellowed letters, ancient hideaways and dark secrets, \\"The Historian\\" manages to be the smartest and most original vampire novel in years. Though the book has a tendency to ramble, Elizabeth Kostova melds history and myth in rare style.hy or goofy, but Kostova manages to make it into pure, quiet horror.  <br /> <br />Moreover, \\"The Historian\\" balances out modern rationality with ancient superstition.

Apparently she's not one to let her fifteen minutes simply tick by -- now she has penned \\"The Washingtonienne,\\" a sleazy and shallow roman a clef.<br /><br />Jacqueline is a New York party girl, smart and sexy, but somewhat spoiled as well. So when her betrayed boyfriend throws her out of their Manhattan apartment, Jacqueline ends up crashing with a pal in Washington. Her goal? Get a fluff job so she can dress nicely and party. But with her sexy appeal on the fore, she gets a lot more than that.<br /><br />In an \\"ugly\\" city with a lot of middle-aged men, Jacqueline finds that she is a much-desired commodity. She has a series of flings with powerful men who will pay her way, and chronicles her naughty adventures in an online blog. Starting to sound familiar? It gets even more so when she is finally busted, fired, and becomes the center of a media storm.<br /><br />The sad thing about \\"The Washingtonienne\\" is that it could have easily been great. It could have been a naughty sleaze-romp, or a wicked satire about men, women and politics. Instead, it reads like a sex-mad little girl's diary, both immature and obnoxiously self-satisfied. \\"The lesson I learned was: You can get whatever you want for free by lying and cheating, and there are never any consequences,\\" Jacqueline leers. Well, that about sums up the depth of the entire novel.<br /><br />Cutler's writing ability is about average for a chick-lit writer, with a lot of lame witticisms and thin characters. Unfortunately, she shows a complete lack of actual inspiration by using her blog and life for the book, but not adding anything to it. We all know how it's going to end, and Cutler doesn't give it any twists to surprise us.<br /><br />But the thing that really scuppers \\"Washingtonienne\\" is Cutler herself. Jacqueline is portrayed as a victim or as a strong woman -- depending on the situation -- and in the end she merely comes across as a sleazy, lazy, mocking brat. Yet Cutler expects us to take Jacqueline seriously, presumably because they are one and the same.<br /><br />Capitalizing on her fifteen minutes, Jessica Cutler churns out her thin little roman a clef. Too bad she couldn't inject any wisdom or insights beyond \\"a sucker's born every minute.\\"zy, mocking brat.

But she rewrites her own love life in \\"Blackmantle,\\" a messy and rather dizzying fantasy novel, which is too vengeful and wild to be enjoyable in its own right.<br /><br />Imagine her autobiography \\"Strange Days,\\" but with a lot more murder.<br /><br />Athyn was born on a battlefield to a dying mystery woman, and was brought back home as a foundling by one of the surviving warriors. Years later, she is cast out of her family's home by her cruel foster brother, and goes on to become a legendary brehon. Then she discovers the shocking truth -- she is actually the hereditary queen of Keltia.<br /><br />During this time, she also falls in love with famed bard Morric Douglass. Eventually the two are married, as Athyn drives out the Firvolgi invaders. But the beautiful junkie Amzalsunëa is still obsessed with Morric, and poisons him when he comes to comfort her. Now Athyn goes on a rampage against anyone who wronged Morric -- and then goes into the underworld itself, to challenge the god of death.<br /><br />At first glance, \\"Blackmantle\\" sounds like a sci-fi version of the Orpheus legend. But it becomes clear after a short time that this is a therapy session put to paper, where Kennealy-Morrison can get revenge on all the people in her life who have ticked her off, then live happily ever after with an idealized, faithful Morrison. It gets a little stomach-turning, in more than one way.<br /><br />It certainly doesn't help that Athyn -- Kennealy-Morrison's glorified alter ego -- is such a nasty person. At one point, she skins and debones several men for trivial slights; she also hunts down and beheads Morric's ex-girlfriend, who is a parodic copy of Morrison's longtime girlfriend Pamela Courson. Not to mention the brutal racism toward the Incomers, whose sole flaw seems to be that they are not Kelts. By the last third of the book, it's hard not to wish that a meteor would crush Athyn.<br /><br />Kennealy-Morrison has an admittedly pretty style, with plenty of description and some truly interesting scene, particularly her vision of the Underworld. It does get a bit exaggerated in its faux-Celtic (faux-Keltic?) atmosphere at times. Unfortunately, it's bogged down by too much talking from Athyn, too much adoration of the plastic Morric, and too much sneering at the absurd parody of Courson.<br /><br />Reality and fantasy collide with a nasty splat in \\"Blackmantle.\\" In the end, it seems merely like a way for Kennealy-Morrison to get back at Courson and the Doors in fiction, as she could not do in life.y-Morrison has an admittedly pretty style, with plenty of description and some truly interesting scene, particularly her vision of the Underworld.

Her cousin Fan Shaw (also about fourteen) is already dressed like a young woman, and hangs out with a gang of shallow, trendy girls. Polly befriends old ladies, sings Scottish airs, and reads books on history. Can she fit in? What's more... does she really want to?<br /><br />Fast forward about five or six years: The Shaw family learns that Polly is returning to the city, intending to give music lessons to help support her brother. Time hasn't really changed Polly -- she's still sweet-natured, moral and pleasant to everyone. But the Shaw family is in serious financial trouble -- and Polly will help out the only way she knows how.<br /><br />In the late 1800s, \\"Girl\\" was written in two separate halves, which might explain why the second half is so much better than the first. The first isn't bad, but it suffers from a sort of prissiness. Virtually every story centers on Polly's moral struggles, with no break. Her story is far more engaging when she learns confidence and strength, not when she's wavering about peer pressure.<br /><br />As in \\"Little Women,\\" Alcott's writing is still pretty readable for modern readers, although most people will not know what a \\"pannier\\" is. She also writes a good understated love story, in Polly's gradual interest in her cousin Tom. You'll know that these two really need to get together, but it's going to take them awhile. So sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Polly may put you off at first with her air of vague goody-two-shoes-ness, but she improves over the course of the book.

It overflows with pretty images and words, but there doesn't seem to be a lot underneath them.<br /><br />Beauty's mother died when she was only a tiny child, leaving her with only the memory of roses. Because magicians failed to predict her mother's death in a riding accident, her father turned against magic completely, even though it ruined his business. Then one of his ships turns up again. When the father asks his daughters what they want, Beauty only asks for a rose.<br /><br />But that rose comes with a price -- her father takes it from the garden of a strange Beast, who demands that Beauty be sent to his palace. Beauty goes voluntarily, if reluctantly. But she finds that the Beast is actually peaceful and gentle, and asks her to marry him regularly. So, of course, Beauty must unravel the curse that keeps him a Beast.<br /><br />Robin McKinley started her career with \\"Beauty,\\" a version of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" that let us see Beauty not as a vapid victim, but as a strong, intelligent young woman. The problem with \\"Rose Daughter\\" is simple: It runs along a lot of the same story tracks, and adds nothing except a few pretty turns of phrase and some peculiar subplots that lead nowhere.<br /><br />Her writing is truly exquisite -- McKinley definitely has a way with descriptions and evocation. \\"Rose Daughter\\" is verbally lush as few fantasy books successfully are. If there had been a plot to go with it, then this might have been a worthy classic.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's a thin retread of the fairy tale, with few new twists and turns; the flower theme is virtually McKinley's only new addition to B&B lore. There are quite a few moments which seem lifted from McKinley's debut, such as the Beast repeatedly asking Beauty to marry him. Both of the lead characters are almost absurdly thin; the Beast never develops a personality, and Beauty never shows a single strong or recognizable feeling. She drifts through like an emotional ghost.<br /><br />\\"Rose Daughter\\" could have been an intriguing, lush look at the traditional fairy tale; instead it feels like an overstretched \\"Beauty Redux.\\" McKinley's prose is exceptional, but everything else fades away.peatedly asking Beauty to marry him.

Consider it a prelude to her darker \\"Inuyasha\\" series.<br /><br />Ranma Saotome is on a shopping trip with his mother -- who believes him to be Akane's female cousin -- when a bear gets loose and tries to attack Nodoka. But a strange boy leaps out and levels the bear, then tells Nodoka that he is her son. Nodoka is overjoyed, and Ranma is enraged that the mysterious Ryu Kumon is impersonating him.<br /><br />When the two young men finally fight, Ranma is defeated -- and almost killed -- with a strange technique called the \\"Thousand Mountain.\\" There's only way to defeat Ryu, and that is an even more powerful technique that Ranma's father created -- the \\"Thousand Seas\\" technique. Now Ranma has to use this incredibly subtle, sinister technique to win back his name -- and his mother.<br /><br />Somewhere around the midpoint of the Ranma series, Takahashi began experimenting with more dramatic stories. This story is one of them -- it's bloodier, almost never funny, and deeply poignant, with Ryu reflecting on the loss of his father, and Ranma desperately trying to get closer to the mother who doesn't know him.<br /><br />Okay, there's a funny story right at the very end, where Happosai is trying to make Ranma cry, so he can create a youth potion. And in the Ryu Kumon story, Ranma's experiments with the \\"Seas\\" technique lead him to drive Akane crazy by putting vegetables in her underwear drawer. However, these scenes are overshadowed by the dramatic duel between two superpowered boys.<br /><br />Takahashi's artwork had also grown more refined and often lifelike by this point, along with some increasingly good battle scenes -- the final duel between Ranma and Ryu is literally explosive, especially when the participants start to strangle one another. On the other hand, we get to see Ranma and Akane genuinely supporting one another.<br /><br />\\"Ranma 1/2\\" is all about the comedy... except with it's dramatic. And though there's humor in the twenty-sixth volume, much of it is a deeper, darker, and poignant story.we get to see Ranma and Akane genuinely supporting one another.    \\"Ranma 1/2\\" is all about the comedy... except with it's dramatic.

Though heavy on prose and light on plot, \\"The Wood Beyond The World\\" is an intriguing look at the baby steps of the fantasy genre.<br /><br />After a disastrous marriage to an unfaithful wife, Walter sails away on a ship, but catches a glimpse of a beautiful queenly woman, a misshapen dwarf, and a lovely young slave girl. When he arrives in a distant land, he encounters all three in a beautiful house in the Wood Beyond The World, where the sexy, manipulative Lady is currently living with a cold-hearted prince.<br /><br />Walter stays there as a guest, and falls in love with the beautiful Maid, despite her mistress's jealousy. But the Lady has taken a liking to him, and despite his love for the Maid, Walter is drawn in by the Lady's magical charm. And breaking free of the jealous sorceress could be fatal for himself and the Maid -- even if they escape, they still have to deal with the savage wilderness of the Wood Beyond the World.<br /><br />\\"The Wood Beyond the World\\" has the distinction of being the first fantasy-quest novel, although it hasn't had nearly the effect on fiction that J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis have had. However, it is an interesting read, especially when one considers that Morris had no mold to work with -- he thought it all up himself.<br /><br />Morris chose to write in a very formal style, with plenty of phrases like \\"then waxed Walter wood-wroth,\\" whatever that means. It's not a light read, and it gives the story the feeling of a minor myth rather than a straightforward fairy tale. And despite its formality, the book has plenty of exquisitely described moments, such as Walter eavesdropping on the Lady and her boytoy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Morris loses his grip on the plot in the last fourth of the book: the Lady and her evil dwarf are dealt with way too quickly. Boom, they're gone. The primitive Bear tribe is an intriguing idea that Morris brings up, and then drops. And the last chapters of the book feel contrived, as if Morris were trying to think up a happy enough ending. And he also seems to forget that Walter is already married, albeit unhappily.<br /><br />\\"The Wood Beyond the World\\" suffers from a rather weak last quarter, but it's an intriguing and often beautiful read. And if nothing else, a literary milestone.r tribe is an intriguing idea that Morris brings up, and then drops.

If it's not Kodachi Kuno or Pantyhose Taro, it's... Akane?<br /><br />Trouble arrives when Pantyhose Taro crashes through the Tendo ceiling -- and has been beaten to a pulp. The suspect seems to be a pretty young girl Akane has befriended, Rouge, who claims that Pantyhose Taro has stolen something important frm her. But how can a delicate, shy young girl beat up the superpowered cursee? The answer turns out to be yet another Jusenkyo curse -- which turns Rouge into a cackling three-headed demon.<br /><br />Romantic trouble arrives when Kodachi is challenged by an old rival -- whoever has the best boyfriend wins. Akane agrees to let Ranma be Kodachi's boyfriend-for-a-day, but the old rival is determined to ruin Ranma's handsome face. And finally, Ranma is peeved when a legendary suit of armor chooses Akane as its wearer -- especially since it allows a newly empowered Akane to defeat him. But the only way to defeat \\"Armie\\" might permanently lose him Akane's love...<br /><br />Action and romance are split down the middle in the \\"Ranma 1/2\\" series -- if someone isn't levelling the Tendo house, then Ranma and Akane are running into new problems in their might-be-might-be-not relationship. Rivals like Ryoga, Ukyo and Shampoo fade into the background so that Ranma and Akane can deal with the biggest obstacles of all: each other.<br /><br />Not that there isn't also a lot of action comedy, such as Ranma being attacked with exploding lilies, or the abrasive Pantyhose Taro rubbing Ranma the wrong way, over and over. Too bad this was the character's final appearance, but he gets a killer exit line. And the mid-air battle between Ranma, Pantyhose Taro and Rouge is outstanding.... despite the fact that the Tendo house is practically in ruins.<br /><br />Ranma and Akane are the focus here, however. The confrontations in which they break one another's hearts is a shocker, as is the scene where Akane is reassured that Ranma really does like her. In Takahashi's world of romance, everything is two steps backward, three steps forward -- slow progress, but still, it's progress.<br /><br />Romantic lies and fiery tornados are the focus in the thirtieth Ranma 1/2 volume, with just the right mix of humor, action and attraction.The confrontations in which they break one another's hearts is a shocker, as is the scene where Akane is reassured that Ranma really does like her.

The first of this fantasy series, \\"The Ratastrophe Catastrophe,\\" is one of those books that has to strain to be halfway funny and a quarter entertaining, but doesn't quite manage it.<br /><br />Evil magic possesses a very ordinary young man named Diek, making his eye glow and giving him the power to charm animals and people with music. At about the same time, the ancient, run-down city of Dullitch is suddenly overriden with thousands of giant rats. Diek offers to charm them away, for a price. He does so... only to be informed that there isn't enough to pay him.<br /><br />So he charms all the city's children away. So the dim Duke hires some not-so-competant mercenaries, including belligerent dwarf Gordo, crocheted-hat-wearing giant Groan, and has-been wizard Tambor. But can they find the missing children and defeat the evil magic in time, or will the parents of Dullitch revolt?<br /><br />Something magical is missing from \\"Ratastrophe Catastrophe,\\" and it's not just because of the constant comparisons to Terry Pratchett. A few too many things -- Dullitch, the Duke, the guilds, even the magical possession story -- are similar to Pratchett's Discworld, but that wouldn't be a problem if Stone had crafted a funny, witty fantasy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he tried and failed. With an old plot like the Pied Piper, a story needs exceptional wit to stand out. Unfortunately Stone seems focused more on contrived jokes that really aren't that funny, like hair loss or the Tower of Screaming Doom. They're a little funny, but not so funny that you might actually laugh at them. If he just let the humour flow, it would have worked better.<br /><br />And even more unfortunately, all the time that Stone spends on his jokes takes away from the characters. They're all paper-thin one-joke characters -- inept wizard, big doof, grumpy dwarf, corrupt politicians. And the most interesting characters vanish pretty quickly, such as the weirdo who is mad because he LIKED having a rat infestation.<br /><br />Humorous fairy-tale retellings are a common thing, but David Lee Stone adds little to the genre in \\"The Ratastrophe Catastrophe.\\" Here's hoping the second book of the series has some substance.ing characters vanish pretty quickly, such as the weirdo who is mad because he LIKED having a rat infestation. <br /> <br />Humorous fairy-tale retellings are a common thing, but David Lee Stone adds little to the genre in \\"The Ratastrophe Catastrophe.\\" Here's hoping the second book of the series has some substance.	2005-06-05

Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.<br /><br />To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.<br /><br />Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...<br /><br />How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.<br /><br />Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.<br /><br />Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience.

C.S. Lewis shifts his focus from the land of Narnia to a more exotic Middle-Eastern setting, and  an archetypical story about a mysterious orphan, a fierce runaway, and two talking horses.<br /><br />Shasta has always lived in the land of Calormene, with a fisherman claiming to be his father. But one day, he hears his \\"father\\" agreeing to sell him as a slave. So Shasta escapes on the visitor's horse -- a talking Narnia horse called Bree, who wants to escape Calormene as much as Shasta does. No sooner have they run away than they encounter a nobly-born girl, Aravis Tarkheena, who is escaping a terrible arranged marriage. Like Shasta, she has a talking mare named Hwin.<br /><br />The two bickering kids decide to escape together, but they soon find themselves pulled to the capital city of Tashbaan, where the Narnian royals are currently staying. And as Shasta starts to unravel the mystery of his own parentage, he and Aravis uncover a plot to kidnap beautiful Queen Susan, and conquer Narnia.<br /><br />\\"The Horse and His Boy\\" is a bit of an oddball story, which doesn't fit into the main storyline of the Narnia Chronicles. Instead, it's a side story which explores the enemies and allies of Narnia, as well as telling readers just what the four Pevensies were doing for all those years in Narnia before returning to our world -- visiting Calormene, a sort of generic Middle-Eastern country.<br /><br />Don't worry, it's not a case of good-Europeans-versus-evil-Middle-Easterners. Prince Radabash is nasty for plot reasons, but Lewis has good Calormenes, bad ones, noble ones, and dizzy ones. And though Lewis' veddy veddy British writing sometimes clashes with the setting, he does an excellent job of bringing traditions and exotic settings to life.<br /><br />Shasta and Aravis are definitely strong lead characters -- Shasta is an archetype orphan who uncovers his true ancestry, and Lewis handles this without any clumsiness. And Aravis is probably Lewis' strongest female character. She's tough, a fighter, smart and resourceful, even when dragging her ditzy pal along to spy on their nasty prince. And neither character tolerates idiocy from the other.<br /><br />\\"The Horse and His Boy\\" is only loosely linked to the other Narnia Chronicles.

Inexplicably, it turns out, because \\"The Starter Wife\\" is full of the vapid, name-dropping superficiality that any housewife from Nebraska could dream up.<br /><br />Gracie is a \\"Wife Of\\" -- wealthy, toned, dyed and perfectly preserved, and married to a Hollywood heavyweight with one kid. Until Kenny hits midlife crisis -- he dresses loudly, gets an earring, and then tells Gracie that he wants a divorce. In the dizzying whirlwind of divorce, Gracie finds out that he's having an affair with Britney Spears (presumably in the months before she started slumming it with Kevin Whatsisface).<br /><br />A concerned pal lends Gracie her Malibu house, so the newly-divorced can get her bearings and life back on track. And as she wanders the California beaches  with her gay pal and married neurotic friend, Gracie finds herself desired by not just one but two men -- a handsome homeless man, and Kenny's dissatisfied has-it-all boss. Can she become more than Kenny's \\"starter wife\\"?<br /><br />Okay, it has a different plot -- one that Shar Jackson might find emotional satisfaction in, admittedly. But the core of \\"The Starter Wife\\" is yet another thin plot, with a moronic heroine and lots of name-dropping. It's even worse that much of Grazer's name-dropping is out of date -- since this book went to press, Brad and Jen have broken up. So no one's worried about them procreating.<br /><br />Grazer's lack of inspiration shows through in the storyline itself, which meanders aimlessly between Hollywood-expose cliches and middle-aged-woman-reinvents-self cliches. The writing meanders as well, as if the author is desperately trying to fill up space. Grazer even has the excruciating taste to name Gracie's gay pal \\"Will.\\" It's not witty or cute, just embarrassing.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest flaw is that Gracie -- the wronged Wife Of-turned-Starter Wife -- is a pill. Despite the men going gaga over her, the supposedly smart Gracie comes across as a bitter airhead, obsessed with age even when she's feeling good about herself. Kenny is a cliche of the Selfish Ex, while Will is a cliche of the Lovable Gay Pal. Only Lou, a tired mogul who wants to know what people really think of him, comes across as a real person.<br /><br />With more Hollywood tale-telling and absurd cliches, Gigi Levangie Grazer slumps even further in her sophomore effort. Sure it's just a fluff book, but it's really bad fluff.upposedly smart Gracie comes across as a bitter airhead, obsessed with age even when she's feeling good about herself.

But when they admire a picture of a strange ship, suddenly all three kids are sucked in -- and land in a Narnian sea. On board the ship is King Caspian, now fully grown, who is determined to find a bunch of knights exiled by his murderous uncle, even if he has to go to the edge of the world (literally).<br /><br />Lucy and Edmund are thrilled to be back in Narnia again, but Eustance proceeds to make trouble any way he can, complaining and causing trouble among the crew. But there are problems more horrifying than any of them can guess, from dragons to sinister \\"gold water\\" to a region filled with their worst nightmares.<br /><br />\\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\" is one of Lewis's most original and tightly-written Narnian adventures. It's also a bit of a break from form. After two books of battles against evil tyrants, \\"Voyage\\" simply goes where no man/woman/mouse has gone before, and gives us a view of the Narnian world as more than one isolated little region.<br /><br />And in some ways, it's also the darkest Chronicle. Lewis explores the theme of greed here -- greed for power, beauty, money and magic -- and has some scenes both chilling and majestic. But his archly humorous style peeks through in several places, whether it's pompous mouse Reepicheep or tea with a reclusive old wizard.<br /><br />Edmund and Lucy are their usual plucky selves, albeit a bit more mature than before. But \\"Voyage\\" also introduces one of Lewis' most interesting characters in Eustace Clarence Scrubb.

They live there somewhat uneasily, until the boy Emrys uses his magic to burn several boys -- and is blinded himself. Still guilt-ridden and unable to remember anything, he sails out and ends up on Fincayra. There he finds that a strange blight is slowly withering away the magical land -- a blight controlled by someone who holds the secret of his past.<br /><br />\\"The Seven Songs of Merlin\\" opens with young Emrys Merlin confidently calling his mother Elen to Fincayra. But his use of magic attracts the evil Rhita Gawr, and a curse meant for Merlin hits his mother instead. Now he has only a short time to find the cure. But to do so, he must master the Seven Songs of wizardry, and find a well to the underworld that is guarded by an ogre whose gaze can kill.<br /><br />After the disastrous events of the second book, Merlin and his friends and family are relaxing in \\"Fires of Merlin.\\" But suddenly they are attacked by a magic-leeching monster, and receive the news that the great \\"Wings of Fire,\\" the dragon Valdearg, has awoken.

Barron was not a newbie to fantasy books when he started the \\"Lost Years\\" series -- he had already written a successful trilogy of modern fantasy stories. And it was the third of those books, \\"The Merlin Effect,\\" that spurred him to explore the boyhood and adolescence of the legendary wizard.<br /><br />While most authors stick closely to the original legends, Barron sweeps all that away in favor of a more fantasy-based story. These stories are populated by all sorts of fantastical monsters, treelings, elves, goblins, evil hags, dwarves, forest girls and quirky bards. And Barron's obvious love of nature shines through the lovingly-described wild places of Fincayra.<br /><br />Merlin himself is a likable hero -- smart, talented and very kind, but also prone to being hot-tempered and overconfident.

Though fans of the dapper magician might be disappointed that he is a supporting character, the title \\"Conrad's Fate\\" indicates who is the star of this twisty, hilarious fantasy.<br /><br />Conrad Tesdinic has always been told by his creepy Uncle Alfred that he has bad karma -- apparently he failed to kill someone in a previous life, and will die in a year unless he kills them now. So Conrad finds himself being shipped off to the castle of Stallery, as a servant, to find the person he has to kill. Joining him is Christopher, a smart boy who seems able to work magic, yet doesn't know what a chili pepper is.<br /><br />Christopher eventually tells Conrad that he is a nine-lived magician, and has run away from his own world to find his friend Millie, who has also run away. She's somewhere in the castle, but he can't find her. Peculiar behavior from the count and his family, a troupe of actors, and strange shifts in reality are plaguing Stallery, and Conrad soon finds that he may have more than bad karma to worry about.<br /><br />Diana Wynne-Jones' most popular fantasy series is the Chrestomanci one, which predated the Harry Potter series with its organizational magic and twinkly British humor. It's complex, funny and more than a little strange, and fans of \\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" will enjoy seeing old favorites -- like Millie and Gabriel -- returning to Jones' writing.<br /><br />Fans of Chrestomanci/Christopher Chant may be slightly disappointed by his secondary role. But then again, the book IS called \\"Conrad's Fate,\\" so it's hardly surprising that the narrator is Conrad. Conrad himself is a likable kid, with bad luck and a pleasant personality, but who is also plagued by spells and lies from the people around him. And Christopher is showing signs of the dapper, intelligent magician he later becomes.<br /><br />The last parts of the book become somewhat confusing, with several intertangled plotlines, only to have Jones suddenly snap them taut. It's a credit to her that she is able to have a shifting castle, runaway magicians, a knitting witch, a gold-digger, faux nobility and an assassination plot all come to a head simultaneously. And her dialogue (\\"You pear-shaped freak!\\") shows that her sense of humor has not dulled with time.<br /><br />At the end of \\"Conrad's Fate,\\" it's hard not to wonder what is going to happen next in the series. Fortunately, in the meantime, this book is a delightful fantasy mystery.e book become somewhat confusing, with several intertangled plotlines, only to have Jones suddenly snap them taut.

But when they admire a picture of a strange ship, suddenly all three kids are sucked in -- and land in a Narnian sea. On board the ship is King Caspian, now fully grown, who is determined to find a bunch of knights exiled by his murderous uncle, even if he has to go to the edge of the world (literally).<br /><br />Lucy and Edmund are thrilled to be back in Narnia again, but Eustance proceeds to make trouble any way he can, complaining and causing trouble among the crew. But there are problems more horrifying than any of them can guess, from dragons to sinister \\"gold water\\" to a region filled with their worst nightmares.<br /><br />\\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\" is one of Lewis's most original and tightly-written Narnian adventures. It's also a bit of a break from form. After two books of battles against evil tyrants, \\"Voyage\\" simply goes where no man/woman/mouse has gone before, and gives us a view of the Narnian world as more than one isolated little region.<br /><br />And in some ways, it's also the darkest Chronicle. Lewis explores the theme of greed here -- greed for power, beauty, money and magic -- and has some scenes both chilling and majestic. But his archly humorous style peeks through in several places, whether it's pompous mouse Reepicheep or tea with a reclusive old wizard.<br /><br />Edmund and Lucy are their usual plucky selves, albeit a bit more mature than before. But \\"Voyage\\" also introduces one of Lewis' most interesting characters in Eustace Clarence Scrubb. Like Edmund, Eustace is initially a peevish, lying boy who generally makes trouble, but slowly learns his errors. But unlike Edmund, Eustace doesn't have to ally himself to the baddie to learn that.<br /><br />\\"Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\" was a turning point for the Narnia Chronicles, as well as the one that began venturing into darker territory.

But the fourth volume of Rumiko Takahashi's \\"Ranma 1/2,\\" Ranma has a new slew of problems -- creepy stalkers, hidden phobias, martial-arts crones, and a girl who won't accept that \\"no\\" is his answer.<br /><br />A new kid has arrived at school: stalkery, cadaverous Hikaru Gosunkugi, who harbors a crush on Akane and deep hatred of her fiancee Ranma. So he begins trying to find out what Ranma's hidden weakness is, but the fearless young martial artist claims there is nothing. Unfortunately, Gosunkugi is spying when Ranma's weakness is revealed -- cats -- and he tries to use it against him... with shocking results.<br /><br />No sooner has Ranma recovered from his peculiar adventure than the tenacious Amazon Shampoo arrives again. Not only does she have a Jusenkyo curse of her own -- the cat -- but she has her wizened great-grandmother Cologne in tow. Cologne is determined to see Ranma marry Shampoo. And so, as Ranma squares off with a rejected suitor of Shampoo's, the old lady traps him in the body of a girl...<br /><br />The fourth volume of his gender-bending action-romantic-comedy introduces some important characters. As well as bringing the incredibly persistent Shampoo back, it also introduces wizened-yet-feisty Cologne, and Mousse, a formidable master of hidden weapons. Or rather, he WOULD be formidable if he weren't legally blind.<br /><br />The fourth volume also has the advantage of showing that Ranma isn't perfect -- up until now, the teenage martial-artist hasn't been slowed down at all, whether by lunatic athletes or ultra-strong romantic rivals. Giving him a raging cat-phobia -- so bad he passes out -- gives him more humanity. As Akane says, \\"It's cute to have a little weakness.\\"<br /><br />And speaking of Akane, she gets her first taste of romantic rivalry in this volume, when Shampoo sets up shop nearby. Though both Ranma and Akane claim that they don't even like each other, their mutual hostility towards any rivals is proof enough that they are starting to fall in love. If only Akane didn't freak out, and Ranma didn't insult her.<br /><br />The fourth volume of \\"Ranma 1/2\\" is a pivotal one, adding even more characters to the romantic spiderweb that stretches all over the series.

So in \\"The Magician's Nephew,\\" C.S. Lewis backpedalled to tell us the story of how Narnia began, the origin of the White Witch, and various other little questions that popped up over the course of his Narnia series. The result is a tense, slightly comic prequel that neatly ties up the various loose threads.<br /><br />Two London schoolchildren, Polly and Digory, meet and befriend one another, despite Digory's misery over his mother's fatal illness. But they fall prey to Digory's arrogant uncle Andrew -- Andrew has created some magical rings that transport the wearer to another world, and he wants the two as guinea pigs. Polly and Digory only narrowly manage to return from a dying world.<br /><br />But they had an unwelcome passenger -- Jadis, an imperious sorceress who plans to take over the world. Polly and Digory are appalled at what has happened, and try to find some way of transporting Jadis elsewhere, using the magical rings. But when they do, they find themselves encountering a world that is just being created, by a strange lion -- the world of Narnia.<br /><br />The Narnia stories are getting more attention in the months before the movie is released. And though it's unknown whether \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" is going to be on the silver screen, it's a valuable read for movie-watchers and readers alike. Basically, if \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" raised any questions, then this can answer them.<br /><br />\\"The Magician's Nephew\\" serves as a neat way of explaining some very weird occurrances -- where did that lamppost come from? Or the Narnian humans? Just where did the White Witch come from, since she doesn't seem to fit in Narnia's springtime utopia? This book pretty much tells it all, as well as providing a character -- Digory -- who is a quiet but important presence fifty years later.<br /><br />But \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" isn't just a way of dealing with loose threads. It's also an entertaining story, full of strange magic and eerie dead worlds. But Lewis also includes some comedy, when Jadis is running amuck all over London, or when Narnian animals try to plant and water Uncle Andrew. Lewis does get a bit hamhanded with the allegory of Jadis and an apple, but the fast, tense storyline makes up for that.<br /><br />\\"The Magician's Nephew\\" is not just a prequel to the rest of the Narnia series, but an entertaining fantasy novel in its own right.

The stories, explanations and legends are still as informative as they were in 1880, although they are rather restricted.<br /><br />Okay, \\"World Guide to Gnomes, Fairies, Elves and Other Little People\\" sounds like a cutesy title for a Brian Froud-illustrated book. And it's a rather lightweight title for a book with genuine merit -- especially the \\"little people\\" part of it, since the elves, fey and gnomes in here are anything but dainty Victorian fairies.<br /><br />Instead, Keightley focuses on traditional goblins, dwarves and elves -- Scandinavian trolls and beautiful alfar, Germanic Zwerge and kobolds, British fairies, Celtic spirits and seal-men, and the epic sagas that greatly influenced early fantasy authors like J.R.R. Tolkien and George MacDonald. Take a look at the chapter on the \\"Eddas and Sagas,\\" and it's hard not to think of Middle Earth.<br /><br />Its one flaw is that it's restricted mostly to Europe -- there's a brief chapter on African superstitions, and one for Judaistic ones. Other than that, nothing that originates outside Europe. While it's understandable, considering the time that Keightley lived in, it's hard not to wonder if he couldn't have found out at least a few other cultural legends.<br /><br />However, this is a rich source for European myths and legends, especially since Keightley obviously did his research. He includes snippets of untranslated poetry, ballads, and footnotes detailing migratory myths and differing versions.  He also summarizes some of the denser material like the two Eddas, which are extremely long and sometimes difficult.<br /><br />Though Thomas Keightley wrote this a hundred and twenty-five years ago, \\"The World Guide to Gnomes, Fairies, Elves and Other Little People\\" is still a valuable and informative resource for anyone interested in European myths and legends.

Lewis	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Pen pals	Just about everyone who knows things about the life of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien knows that he was pals with fellow fantasy writer C.S. Lewis, the author of the classic \\"Narnia\\" series and the sci-fi Ransom trilogy. But where that's usually a sidenote in Tolkien biographies, Colin Duriez makes it the center of double-biography \\"Tolkien and C.S. Lewis: The Story of A Friendship.\\"<br /><br />Duriez focuses on Lewis and Tolkien's early lives, the differences in their religious progressions, their wartime experiences, their fantasy works and their involvement in Christian literary club The Inklings. In 1926, the quiet Tolkien (\\"Tollers\\") and ebullient Lewis met and became friends over a shared love of Christianity, language myth and imagination.<br /><br />Duriez's main idea in \\"Story of Friendship\\" is that this friendship created some of the most influential fantasy and science fiction ever, by mutual support. Religious beliefs and \\"the horns of elfland\\" were important for them both. For example, it was partly through Lewis's encouragement that Tolkien managed to finish his stories of Middle-Earth, and Tolkien in turn helped with Lewis's more serious works.<br /><br />Duriez doesn't reveal anything new about the friendship or the men in it, and he focuses quite a bit on the Inklings at large at one point. (Since he wrote a book on them, it isn't surprising) However, he clearly is a big fan of both men and his enthusiasm is obvious. He briskly clears away some misconceptions -- for example, Tolkien did not hate the Narnia books, he merely \\"disliked\\" them -- and throws in some literary analysis of Middle-Earth, the Ransom books and Narnia that doesn't stray too far from the authors' intents.<br /><br />\\"Tolkien and C.S. Lewis: The Story of Friendship\\" doesn't offer more than a few tidbits that are new, but it's a good focus on Tolkien and Lewis's friendship and how it affected their epic books.	2005-05-22

And he will be known for nothing else, apparently. At least, he won't be remembered for \\"Madonna,\\" a quickie biography that covers no new ground and -- horrors! -- makes a once-controversial pop icon... boring.<br /><br />Madonna Louisa Ciccone started off as a motherless child, whose mom (also called Madonna) died of breast cancer. But she rapidly turned from pitiful to outrageous, travelling to NYC to become a dancer. Instead, she became a blossoming singer, an aspiring actress, and one of the first big stars to grace MTV.<br /><br />But more than her music was the controversy that surrounded her: Madonna dated men such as Michael Jackson, JFK Jr., Prince, and then-hot rapper Vanilla Ice, and married actor Sean Penn, while still pursuing relationships with other men and women. After their tumultuous union fell apart, she created the then-shocking book \\"Sex,\\" the peak of her sexually-charged career. But then her life took a more domestic turn, with children, marriage and religion (in about that order).<br /><br />It's not hard to have an opinion on Madonna -- either you love her or hate her. But if the only exposure to Madonna was through this book, it would be difficult to decide which. Morton paints Madonna in bland hues, describing her exploits, affairs and then-shocking concerts in the most uninspired prose imaginable. However, not once does he reveal anything new -- despite input from lovers and friends, Morton can only add detail to what people already knew.<br /><br />There are some interesting facets of her rise to stardom, particularly how she and her pals changed the NYC club life, and the odd details of her first recordings. For example, she wasn't pictured on her first album, in the hopes that she would be thought to be black. But once we get back to Madonna's personal life, things get dull.<br /><br />Morton himself seems to presume too much on his knowledge of Madonna: he constantly claims that she was miserable, depressed, et cetera. Apparently he disapproves of her wild past. Entertainingly, he claims that Madonna is just a \\"Catholic girl who wants to get married.\\" If that is how \\"just Catholic girls\\" live, then I want to know why I'm not having that much fun.<br /><br />Yet, at the same time, he glosses over most of her present, peaceful, monogamous life -- when she gets involved with Guy Ritchie and has her second child, he loses interest and crams the last several years into a matter of pages. One would think that her first solid relationship and her children would be worthy of a little more attention.<br /><br />Nobody expected Pulitzer-worthy journalism in \\"Madonna.\\" But surely Andrew Morton could have done better than a tepid recounting of what her fans already knew.too much on his knowledge of Madonna: he constantly claims that she was miserable, depressed, et cetera.

Her entertainingly fluffy satire \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\\" certainly fits the bill, with its love-seeking heroine and amusing jokes. It never dips far below the surface, but its lightness is part of its appeal.<br /><br />\\"A gentleman friend and I were dining at the Ritz last evening and he said that if I took a pencil and a paper and put down all of my thoughts it would make a book.\\" Meet Lorelei Lee, a pretty blonde socialite with a love of jewels, men, and luxury. She has a married boyfriend, but is convinced to go abroad so her name won't be \\"smirched.\\"<br /><br />So Lorelei and her pal Dorothy head off to Europe, bumping into exalted people (like \\"Dr. Froyd\\") and winning the hearts of wealthy men, in between days-long parties. Gold-digging, millionaires, money and love all get wrapped up in the tangle of Lorelei's everyday life...<br /><br />Lorelei first appeared in Harper's Bazaar, and a short story stretched out into a full-length novel that appeared in serials. A first edition sold out almost instantly. Now Lorelei has countless descendents -- sure, those determined gals have been updated for the twenty-first century, with jobs and Web access. But light women's fiction could be seen to stem from Loos's novel.<br /><br />A satirical edge runs through \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,\\" poking fun at the jazzy gals whom Loos had to deal with regularly. Loos doesn't spare anything -- the book is riddled with intentional typos, like \\"encyclopediacs,\\" \\"safires\\" and \\"maskerades\\" (yet she can spell \\"champagne\\"). The shallowness of the flappers is best shown in straight-faced jokes about the latest Parisian styles of buttons. Loos's satire doesn't bite down to the bone, but it does scratch lightly in a deliciously catty way.<br /><br />Lorelei has an entertaining mix of determination, idiocy, and a constant belief in her own towering intellect. She's so much fun it's hard not to like her, in spite of the fact that she's an utter airhead.

And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth.

His cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs from the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.<br /><br />\\"Return of the King\\" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.<br /><br />\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.<br /><br />Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual. Merry and Pippin start out a bit flaky, but are matured by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue ranges from goofy and hilarious to solemn and archaic, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary -- readers with short attention spans won't be able to handle this story. If they can handle sprawling, epic tales, then probably they can.<br /><br />Even after all the years, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lordof the Rings\\" still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and few books have even come close to equalling it.of the Rings\\" still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature.

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement.k it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well.

But a mysterious traveller joins them on their journey -- and soon Moril's father is murdered, his brother is jailed, and his sister is enmeshed in a conspiracy involving the Duke's son. Now Moril must find a way to save his family, using a magical cwidder.<br /><br />\\"In \\"Drowned Ammet,\\" the impoverished Alhammitt (called \\"Mitt\\") has become a radical of sorts, after his father and mother are tossed out because of an evil duke. Later, the Free Holanders also take his father. Mitt is determined to get revenge, but his years of planning go awry, and he ends up desperately fleeing to the North with two captives... only to encounter storms, gods, and much more.<br /><br />\\"The Spellcoats\\" is the tale of Tanaqui, centuries before the first two volumes of the quartet. She lives with her family in prehistoric Dalemark, where a battle is being fought between the \\"Heathens\\" and their own folk. When her brother returns, insane, she and her family must flee their village. But Tanaqui learns of the existance of Kankredin, a malevolent wizard who is waiting for them.<br /><br />In the final volume, \\"Crown of Dalemark,\\" a forthright young boy named Mitt is called on to be an assassin. A countess wants him to destroy a young lady, Noreth, who may become the uniting monarch of Dalemark. But Mitt begins to like Noreth, and so joins her supporters.

If anything, it seems steadier and more controlled than \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" as several characters become more central and the plot focus widens to envelop all of Middle Earth. It suffers from a bit of sequelitis in places, but the overall book is just as enthralling as the first.<br /><br /> Aragorn finds that Merry and Pippin have been abducted rather than killed -- for what reason, no one knows. Frodo and Sam have left on their own. So Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli race to find the orcs and retrieve the hobbits, but are stopped by the fierce Riders of Rohan, and then by an old and dear friend: Gandalf, who has been resurrected in the new form of a White wizard. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin must use all of their wits to escape the orcs, and then find a strange band of allies that no one could have hoped for.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam head into Mordor -- with an eerily familiar figure, Gollum, following them. Frodo subjugates Gollum, forcing him to swear on \\"the precious\\" that he won't harm him. In return, Gollum promises to guide the two hobbits through Mordor, straight to Mount Doom. But the Ring is weighing more heavily than ever on Frodo, and is starting to reassert its old sway on Gollum...<br /><br />One of the most noticeable changes in this book is the shift of focus. \\"Fellowship\\" was Frodo-centric, since the narration revolved around him, as did all the events and thoughts. But with the breaking of the Fellowship, the narration falls into three categories: Frodo and Sam; Merry and Pippin; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. This triple style allows individuals to shine more brightly, when they are called on to do more than hike with Frodo.<br /><br />Tolkien also presented a wider view of Middle-Earth in general. While the slow slog through Mordor doesn't really tell or show readers much -- aside from what a hellhole Sauron is the middle of -- it's shocking to see the the effects of the orcs, Saruman and Sauron on places such as Gondor and Rohan.<br /><br />Changes can be seen in Frodo even in this book, and which become more pronounced in the third book of the trilogy, \\"Return of the King.\\" He becomes sadder and more introspective, and the Ring's growing hold on him can be glimpsed at times. Aragorn is also changing. He is no longer merely the rugged outcast Ranger, but displays the hints of a future great king, if he can only get to his throne.<br /><br />Merry and Pippin also change: these two innocent young hobbits have to suddenly Sam is more promiment in this book, as Frodo's friend and personal pillar of strength.<br /><br />But where Tolkien really outdid himself is Gollum. Gollum returns, in a substantially different state. Oh, he's still addled and addicted to the Ring, but he displays a dual love/loathing for the Ring, a weird affection for Frodo (who, from his point of view, is probably the only person who has been kind to him), and displays a Ring-induced multiple-personality syndrome. Very rarely can bad guys elicit the sort of loathing and pity from the reader that Gollum does.<br /><br />One noticeable aspect of this book is friendship. When the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, virtually everyone is a stranger, with the exception of the hobbits. However, in this book we get our view of how much Sam loves Frodo and wants to help him. Sam is fully aware of how much Frodo needs emotional support, and he's quite willing to be a pillar of strength for his friend. We see Gimli and Legolas's affection for Merry and Pippin; and Legolas's willingness to kill Eomer if Eomer hurts Gimli shows how far this Elf and Dwarf have come.<br /><br />This book is substantially darker than \\"Fellowship.\\" Frodo is starting to stumble under the weight of the Ring, and other characters die or are seriously hurt. The scene where Pippin's mind is trapped by Sauron is a very disturbing one, as is a violent and saddening scene late in the book. But there is alsosome wry humor: Gandalf's joke as he hears Saruman throttling Grima Wormtongue, Legolas's snippy comments about pipeweed as Gimli and the hobbits smoke up a storm, and Sam's debate with Gollum about whether they should cook the rabbits.<br /><br />Tolkien's second \\"Lord of the Rings\\" novel is a thrilling fantasy adventure, exploring more of his invented world than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did. \\"The Two Towers\\" starts heading into darker territory, and will leave readers panting for more.some wry humor: Gandalf's joke as he hears Saruman throttling Grima Wormtongue, Legolas's snippy comments about pipeweed as Gimli and the hobbits smoke up a storm, and Sam's debate with Gollum about whether they should cook the rabbits.<br /><br />Tolkien's second \\"Lord of the Rings\\" novel is a thrilling fantasy adventure, exploring more of his invented world than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did. \\"The Two Towers\\" starts heading into darker territory, and will leave readers panting for more.	2005-05-20

But she veered off to the dark side in \\"Thin Skin.\\" This novel is as sharp and dark as a bloody knife, with its unflinching look at the beautiful people who only see a skeleton behind their faces.<br /><br />Ruby is a beautiful young actress, with fair success and an intensity that attracts men -- as dark and rich as the jewel. But she's miserable. She wanders through an empty life, meditating on her first love, her bulimia, and the way she cuts herself. At twenty, she is burned out, and determined to have her outside reflect her inner rot, and to be alone.<br /><br />Then she bumps into Rachel, the soon-to-be-ex-wife of Ruby's ex-lover. Rachel takes unexpected pity on Ruby, finding a confused child inside the jaded starlet. She tries to help Ruby, and a strange friendship pops up between them. But not even friends, roommates and lovers can keep Ruby from attempting suicide.<br /><br />A person who is self-destructing is a terrible sight. So horrifying, in fact, that most people prefer to shut their eyes to the reality; especially if the person seems to \\"have it all\\" -- beauty, youth and talent. Most people assume that there is nothing to be unhappy about. But Emma Forrest keeps her eyes wide open to the horrors of Ruby's inner life. It's a harrowing read, but it would be worthless as literature if Forrest didn't explore up to the brink.<br /><br />Perhaps the most unnervingly good thing about \\"Thin Skin\\" is that Forrest captures the manic wildness that comes to a person who is about to go over the edge. For example, when Rachael tells Ruby that she's \\"all wrong,\\" Ruby delightedly responds \\"I know!\\" Sure, the narrative rambles. Sure, Ruby is self-absorbed. But sadly, that is the portrait of a person who is slowly imploding -- they do ramble in their own heads, and their universe is taken up by their problems.<br /><br />The storyline reflects Ruby's meandering life, as she wanders from one place to another, without caring. Forrest perfectly captures the smell, sight and feel of dark bars, L.A. boutiques and sterile hospitals. But there is also a dark poetry to her writing. Early on, she describes how \\"me and the thought of suicide walked home, arm in arm, laughing at the wind like young lovers.\\" Much like the book itself, it's both beautiful and disturbing.<br /><br />\\"Thin Skin\\" is a very disturbing read.

Tolkien's epic saga, the fantasy that created the genre as we know it today. Now, as the blockbuster movie adaptation is over, many readers are checking out the dramatic story that ends Tolkien's masterpiece and life's work.<br /><br />The story opens where \\"Two Towers\\" left off. Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives.  And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.<br /><br />In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?<br /><br />Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline, one by one. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel;  Tolkien shows that in a struggle against evil, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.<br /><br />This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Aside from Frodo's emotional deterioration, we also have Merry becoming almost catatonic after the battle with the Witch King, and Denethor's descent into suicidal madness. There is a lot less humor, though it is still there: Pippin and Merry both thinking about food, Gandalf's reaction when Pippin pledges his sword to Denethor, some choice witty comments of Frodo's in the last chapters, and Gimli's half-joking threats to axe Eomer if Eomer doesn't consider Galadriel the most beautiful woman in the world.<br /><br />Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, and of course the bittersweet final scene.<br /><br />Frodo is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down by the pressure of the Ring, to the point where he seems to be only a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves -- now he's attacking orcs and carrying Frodo to Mount Doom.<br /><br /> Merry is exposed firsthand to the horrifying consequences of war, and Pippin moves past his initial flakiness in an effort to be a serious warrior. Aragorn breaks completely from the mold of rugged ranger and into the new status as a king, leading armies (both living and dead) without flinching. As far as the supporting cast goes, Legolas and Gimli assist as well; their friendship grows deeper, even as Legolas falls completely in love with the sea. And the icily passionate war-maiden Eowyn affects the War of the Ring in a stunning way thatnobody could have predicted.<br /><br />The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. Another good addition is \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of LOTR can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following LOTR.<br /><br />It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants. But as Gandalf says, \\"I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\\"nobody could have predicted.<br /><br />The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book.

239934:US	50881246	R3F4M51SRNT2MJ	1592243754	463707544	Vanity Fair	Books	5	0	0	N	N	All's fair in love and "Vanity"	Greed, gold-digging and deception sit at the heart of \\"Vanity Fair.\\" It's no joke that it's subtitled \\"a novel without a hero\\" -- William Makepeace Thackeray mercilessly skewered the pretentions and flaws of the upper class all throughout it. The result is a gloriously witty social satire.<br /><br />It opens with two young women departing from a ladies' academy: dull, sweet Amelia (rich) and fiery sharp-witted Rebecca (poor). Becky Sharp is a relentless social climber, and her first effort to rise \\"above her station\\" is by trying to get Amelia's brother to marry her -- an effort thwarted by Amelia's fiancee. So instead she gets married to another family's second son, Rawdon Crawley.<br /><br />Unfortunately, both young couples quickly get disinherited and George is killed. But Becky is determined to live the good life she has worked and married for -- she obtains jewels and money from admiring gentlemen, disrupting her marriage. But a little thing like a tarnished reputation isn't enough to keep Becky down...<br /><br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is actually a lot more complex than that, with dozens of little subplots and complicated character relationships. Reading it a few times is necessary to really absorb all of it, since it is not just a look at the two women in the middle of the book, but at the upper (and sometimes lower) social strata of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />The main flaw of the book is perhaps that it sprawls too much -- there's always a lot of stuff going on, not to mention a huge cast of characters, and Thackeray sometimes drops the ball when it comes to the supporting characters and their little plots. It takes a lot of patience to absorb all of this. However... it's worth it.<br /><br />Like most nineteenth-century writers, Thackeray had a very dense, formal writing style -- but once you get used to it, his writing becomes insanely funny. Witticisms and quips litter the pages, even if you don't pick them all up at once. At first Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.<br /><br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her.

In Rumiko Takahashi's \\"The Return of Lum: Urusei Yatsura,\\" the extraterrestrial gets a nasty shock from her past, which threatens to affect her \\"darling.\\"<br /><br />A very enthusiastic young teacher comes to Tomobiki High, and receives a shock when the new transfer student has horns and can fly. Lum soon joins the girl's volleyball team, not knowing that the captain LOATHES all men. Not to mention the parent-teacher day, when the cast's assorted strange moms arrive. Ataru's love for all things female pops up when a pretty female ninja, Kaede, desperately tries to get a secret document from him. He continues pursuing her when she leaves her job and is pursued by a number of inept ninja.<br /><br />And then a new girl, Ran, arrives at the school -- and turns out to be an old pal of Lum's. Unfortunately, she has a split personality -- one side is sweet and cute, the other is completely insane and vengeful. And because of some unfortunate childhood incidents (involving bedwetting and ice cream), she plans to get revenge on Lum, by stealing Ataru's youth. Since she does that with a kiss, Ataru is all too willing....<br /><br />Ran is one of the most entertaining characters in the \\"Urusei Yatsura\\" series -- she's completely insane. As a result, Takahashi's stories with her are among the most entertaining (with the exception of Rei, whom Ran has a \\"thing\\" about). When you have someone who's out for revenge and comically crazed, expect fun.<br /><br />This is one of the rare collections that has not a dud story in it -- Takahashi veers from strength to strength, be it psychotic ninja hags or a school play disrupted by Ataru and Ran. We also get the entertaining spectacle of Lum being joined to Ataru's hip even at school.<br /><br />We also get introduced to new characters, such as Mendo and Lum's moms. One is snotty, autocratic and abhors machinery, and the other is an upbeat older version of her daughter. And despite only brief appearances by fan faves Cherry and Sakura, we get Kaede the job-seeking ninja, and Mr. Hanawa, the overenthusastic young teacher who speaks in cliches.<br /><br />\\"Sweet Revenge\\" is indeed a sweet collection of \\"Urusei Yatsura\\" stories.

New alliances are forged, new information is found, and the endangered Milla takes the biggest risk of her life. While not quite the most gripping, this book hints at future apocalyptic events further on in the series.<br /><br />Tal and Milla have just returned to Aenir, and end up falling in with a group of rebel Underfolk, who are determined to rise above the nasty caverns where they live. He also finds Jarnil, a blinded Chosen who was thought to be dead, and the ringleader of the rebels. With his help -- and the discovery that the Codex is wandering around the Castle.<br /><br />Elsewhere. Milla leaves the Castle to return to the Icecarls. Since she now has a Spiritshadow, she knows that they will kill her. However, the Crones come to a decision about Milla that will change their culture forever. And at the Castle, Tal and the belligerent Underfolk Crow uncover the secrets of the Keystones -- a secret guarded by the inhuman Sushin.<br /><br />\\"Above the Veil\\" is one of those books that serves mainly to set up the action of future novels. Garth Nix's creepy fantasy elements and taut writing keep it from being one long boring infodump. And by the ending, some very important events have taken place.<br /><br />Nix also reveals more about the Underfolk, and their lives as semi-slaves under the Castle, as well as the natural resentment they have toward the privileged Chosen. Nix's intense writing is well-suited to scenes like Milla being attacked by a fellow Icecarl, or our heroes being attacked by venomous water spiders. There are a few moments of comedy, usually from Uncle Ebbitt, but not many.<br /><br />Tal and Milla have both changed dramatically. Tal has already learned to appreciate the warlike Icecarls, and now he has to accept the Underfolk, which he always took for granted. Milla also has grown up, although her sense of honor and loyalty is unchanged. Crow isn't nearly as likable -- he's even more bigoted than Tal was originally. But Nix makes it understandable why that is.<br /><br />The fourth Seventh Tower book, \\"Above the Veil,\\" begins the buildup to the final battle of the series.

But Isabel Allende struck out in \\"City of the Beasts,\\" an excruciatingly dull, preachy, awkwardly written fantasy with some of the most obnoxious characters imaginable. While Allende is a talented writer of magical realism, straight-out fantasy seems beyond her.<br /><br />Alexander Cold's mother is suffering from cancer, and while she is in Texas for chemotherapy he is sent to stay with his grandmother Kate. Not only is Kate unstable and weird, but also is heading off on an expedition into the Amazon jungle to find a sort of jungle yeti called \\"the Beast.\\"<br /><br />Though initially disliking the expedition, Alexander befriends Nadia, the daughter of the guide, who teaches him about the wildlife and the natives of the Amazon. Alexander quickly falls in step with Nadia, learning all about his totem animal and magic. But soon they discover that the jungle and the mysterious \\"People of the Mist\\" are in danger of destruction -- by someone in their group.<br /><br />One of the worst things about this book is the fact that Allende seems to keep in mind constantly that she is writing for kids. A good book can be appreciated by adults and children alike. You don't have to dumb it down. But dumb it down she does -- she seems to think that not only is her audience young, but also too unintelligent to appreciate good literature.<br /><br />While Allende gives great care to her regular novels, here she seems sloppy, having her heroes magically develop powers whenever they are needed. For example, there's a language barrier between Alexander and the People. No problem -- he just \\"listens with his heart\\" and the language thing isn't a problem.<br /><br />Part of the book's dullness is the extreme detail that Allende throws in, apparently to show that she did her research. Enormous stretches are devoted to life on the Amazon, justifying ritual cannibalism and interbreeding polygamy. In other words, when she wants to lecture readers about piranha, expect the plot to grind to a halt. Unfortunately, that focus on detail also kills all sense of urgency -- when someone is murdered, the others don't get upset. Instead they argue about funerary rites.<br /><br />Moreover, Allende's attention seems to wander halfway through the book -- she seems to forget all about the \\"conspiracy\\" and Alexander's dying mother, only to yank up the plot threads a few hundred pages later. The backhistory of the mysterious \\"Beasts\\" is both boring and silly, as is the frantic conspiracy that Allende rigs up near the end.<br /><br />Alexander Cold is a ridiculously boring character, especially since halfway through the book, he sheds all his doubts and fears. Nadia is portrayed as a quirky, magical girl, but her New-Age preaching and preening make her seem like a mouthpiece. Kate comes across as abusive rather than strong, and the professor is so absurdly racist, sexist and boorish that he's impossible to take seriously. All \\"modern\\" people are evil or whiny, while the Indians are noble -- in other words, Allende opted to write cliches rather than characters.<br /><br />And most unforgivably: The preachiness. On every other page Allende reminds us how wonderful nature is, despite portraying the Amazon as a nightmare hole, and having a seemingly sympathetic character murder an animal to \\"set it free.\\"  She never makes us feel any awe or love for nature, or any real urgency to conserve the wild places of the world.<br /><br />The beauty of nature -- and human nature -- are lacking in \\"City of the Beasts,\\" a sloppy and poorly thought-out excuse for a fantasy.

Books	4	0	0	N	Y	Childhood memories	A very chaotic way of life got worse for Ataru and alien princess Lum when deranged redhead Ran entered the scene. And Ran's revenge attempts rule \\"Ran Attacks!\\", one of the most entertaining volumes of Rumiko Takahashi's first long-running series. (\\"I still have scars from that coincidence!\\")<br /><br />Mayhem rules when Sakura agrees to create a love potion for Lum to give Ataru... except it seems to have a strange effect on him. Later on, Ataru tries to cheat with a god of knowledge, a host of deities crash the \\"Plains of Heaven\\" play (or as Lum calls it, \\"Stairway to Heaven\\"), and a closed campus policy sets off a war between the rebellious students and their wily teachers. Then a ghost cat starts haunting the staircase, and Lum and Ten get drunk on pickled plums -- and Lum is a mean drunk.<br /><br />But all is not over with Ran, the deranged redhead who holds several childhood grudges against Lum. To protect Ataru, Lum clones him -- except that Ran also clones him, and soon an army of Atarus is running amuck. Ten loses his powers when his horn falls off -- much to Ataru's delight. And gluttonous yet gorgeous alien Rei arrives at the school, and Ran tries to win him over with her lunch -- but things are not that easy.<br /><br />Rumiko Takahashi excels at creating complex, entertaining series that would have been drivel in someone else's hands. In this case, the comical story of the world's unluckiest, most lecherous teenager, and how he (very slowly) falls in love with a strong-willed alien princess. With lots of electric shocks, creepy priests and flying tiger-cows, of course.<br /><br />Probably the closest thing this volume has to a dud story is Ran's tough-talking button, which she sends to control Ataru. The rest of the time, it's lovable mayhem, out-of-control attractions, and weird alien problems (like the cactus growing from baby Ten's head).<br /><br />Ataru is the same ol' girl-hunting lech as always, who inexplicably doesn't notice anything weird about Ran. Takahashi provides a bit more insight into the childhood grudges that Ran has against Lum, and also shows what happens when Oni lose their horns. Alas, fan favorites like priestess Sakura, creepy monk Cherry, and long-suffering Shinobu appear relatively briefly.<br /><br />The deranged Ran adds extra spice to an already funny volume of alien hijinks.

Lian Hearn's first novel of the Tales of the Otori has good bones, but the writing has all the warmth and intensity of muddy water.<br /><br />In the Three Countries, a young boy named Tomasu lives among the Hidden, a small peaceful religious village who don't harm anyone. But one day he returns home to discover that his family has been cruelly slaughtered by Lord Iida. He's almost next, but he's soon saved by the semi-mysterious Lord of the Otori, Shigeru, a sort of renegade lord in the Machievellian world of politics.<br /><br />Given the name of Takeo, he becomes Otori's ward and is adopted by him on his travels, since he now has no one else. Shigeru also reveals that Takeo is one of the few remaining members of the Tribe, a people with mysterious powers and abilities. Takeo learns more about his new skills, but also learns of the sinister plots he is expected to deal with...<br /><br />Japanese history and folklore are a much-underused fantasy source, compared to Anglo or Celtic fantasy, which is used in every other fantasy novel you come across. Hearn has definitely done his research, and he seamlessly integrates fantasy elements into a medieval Japanese setting. Concepts such as the Tribe, the complicated political strife and the Nightingale Floor -- a floor that squeaks loudly at the slightest touch -- are fantastic.<br /><br />What's wrong with the book? The writing. While Hearn has the basic descriptions down of flowers, people, forests and creepy action scenes, nothing comes alive. Tense, dramatic, action-filled scenes are flat and rather slow, and even the slaughter of the hero's entire village is almost instantly forgotten. The good guys are utterly noble in all things, while the bad guys are evil through 'n' through.<br /><br />Takeo in particular seems passionless and rather dull. He goes through all sorts of harrowing experiences, but doesn't seem to feel anything. Shigeru was so noble and distant that I found it hard to care much about him; he seems like a cardboard standup of a noble renegade hero. Hearn tries to inject a little emotion into the characters from time to time, but they end up seeming manic instead of passionate.<br /><br />While the idea itself is a very intriguing one, the execution is definitely lacking.

Taylor struck out with his much-hyped debut, the tepid religious fantasy \\"Shadowmancer.\\" And the follow-up, \\"Wormwood,\\" is even less engaging than \\"Shadowmancer\\" was -- while it's fairly well written, it's loosely strung together with dull characters and a plodding plot.<br /><br />In the mid 1700s, London is gripped by panic -- somehow the earth is overspinning, and then it stops so that London is plunged into permanent night. A young servant girl, Agetta, is terrified of what is going to happen, especially because her master, Kabbalah master and scientist Dr Sabian Blake, is predicting that a comet called Wormwood will strike the earth.<br /><br />This information comes from the mysterious book, Nemorensis, that Blake was given by a stranger. The Nemorensis supposedly contains all the secrets of the universe. Unfortunately, the book also exerts a sinister influence over Agetta. But in an attic is Tegatus, an angelic being who might just be the savior London needs...<br /><br />Religious fantasy, or fantasy with religious undertones, is not a bad thing -- J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis and others allowed their religions to influence their life's work. But G.P. Taylor not only has the subtlety of a battering ram -- he's also quite boring. The story plods along in a string of little plot-related scenes, without building up much momentum.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems is the way Taylor handles the fantastical elements of his book. Okay, there are weird creatures. Most fantasy books have those. But his seem to just be thrown into the mix for no apparent reason. His handling of superstition and science in the 1700s is sketchy at best, no matter how brilliant a scientist Blake is meant to be.<br /><br />Taylor has a decent enough writing style, and he has a certain flair for description and atmosphere. But his style is also very repetitive and over-the-top -- where are the editors when you need them? What's worse, his idea of creating a fantasy world seems to be to just toss in a few weird elements that have nothing to do with the plot. The actual fantasy plot is just more of Taylor's lukewarm, generic Christian sentiments, and some truly bizarre theology. Can angels drown?<br /><br />The characters are as thin as the pages. There are a lot of characters for a relatively slim fantasy book, and many of them are left underdeveloped. Blake and Agetta are the only ones who receive any character development, and that isn't saying much. Agetta in particular seems almost manic, considering how fast her moods swing.

It became an unexpected hit, and spawned a series of sequels that came to be known as the Vampire Chronicles. The first four books of the series are compiled here, although the fourth is not up to the excellent standards of the first three.<br /><br />\\"Interview With the Vampire\\" is the story of Louis, a grieving young widower and plantation owner, whose life is turned upside down when he meets the charming vampire Lestat. Lestat offers him a way out: become a vampire. Louis accepts, but once it's done, he finds that vampirism is more than he bargained for -- especially for his conscience.<br /><br />\\"The Vampire Lestat\\" takes a totally different tack, showing us the world through the enigmatic, charming Lestat's eyes. After years of dormancy, Lestat wakes up in time for the early MTV years of the 1980s, becoming a rock star in the tradition of Ozzy and Black Sabbath. And like Louis, Lestat relates his long life's story -- how he became a vampire, his wanderings over the earth, and his investigations into the origins of vampirism itself...<br /><br />\\"Queen of the Damned\\" builds on that research. Lestat's metal music has caused quite a bit of mayhem -- but not this much before: Akasha, Egyptian queen and mother of all vampires, has reawoken from her comalike sleep. The lesser vampires are having strange dreams, some are being murdered by the ruthless queen. Apparently she wants to kill all men. What is more, Akasha has taken a shine to the roguish Lestat himself...<br /><br />\\"The Tale of the Body Thief\\" opens with lonely anti-hero Lestat deciding that he wants to be mortal again. At least temporarily. So he engages in some corpus-swapping with a con man (Danger! Danger, Will Lestat!), and rediscovers the joys (romance with a nun) and miseries (excretion) of being a human being again. The problem is, said con man is not eager to return Lestat's attractive and immortal body once he has it...<br /><br />Vampiric autobiography is a given in Anne Rice's bibliography -- she has plenty of bloodsuckers telling us about their lives. But Lestat and Louis's were not just the first ones, but perhaps the most compelling and rich, especially since the two had such radically different viewpoints -- including of one another. Is Lestat a heartless fiend, or a roguish good-craving bad boy? I'd lean towards the latter, to be honest.<br /><br />Rice does stumble in \\"Tales of the Body Thief,\\" which seems like too flimsy a plot for Lestat and Co., has an unnecessary nun romance, and which has some very gross moments. However, it does give a stunning look at how a vampire would see the everyday life of a human -- all the problems, discomforts, annoyances and loneliness that we all ignore because we're used to it. It's a more personal story than the epic \\"Queen of the Damned,\\" which deals with all of vampirekind all through history.

Fortunately Donald Zec does a solid job with \\"Sophia: An Intimate Biography,\\" a balanced, fair and non-drooling look at Loren's life and career.<br /><br />Sofia Scicolone was born to a commitmentphobic lothario and his latest girlfriend, a beautiful girl who looked like Greta Garbo. Unfortunately, he wasn't willing to marry her, so Sofia grew up with her mother's family. Plain and unhappy (she was sometimes called \\"stecchetto\\" -- little stick -- as a child), she grew up in the throes of World War II.<br /><br />But Sofia (renamed Sophia Loren) blossomed into a beauty, and later got jobs as a movie extra and a \\"fumetti\\" (comic) model. Soon her movie career boomed, pairing her with movie greats like Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant (who wanted to marry her) and Marcello Mastroianni. And despite being known as a sexpot, Sophia also established herself as a wonderful and versatile actress.<br /><br />Considering Loren's beauty, sex appeal and onetime scandalous involvement with husband Carlo Ponti, it would be too easy to make this a salacious tell-all. But Zec keeps it dignified -- no half-nude photos, no \\"battle of the bosoms,\\" no she-slept-with-everyone rumors. Instead we have Sophia dancing for joy at winning an Oscar, sobbing in \\"Two Women,\\" and posing with her sons.<br /><br />Zec also has a solid writing style, laid back and very relaxed. He also has a certain way with words: \\"... a girl raised midway between an armament factory and an erupting volcano is about as easy a pushover as a phial of nitroglycerine.\\"  He seems to like Loren as a person, which gives his analysis of her life a friendly tone.<br /><br />Zec also keeps an eye on the extended members of Loren's family, from her husband Carlo Ponti, her Garbo-lookalike mother, and her pretty younger sister. It even includes personal interviews between the author, Loren and family members, which shows a certain level of respect and reliability. This is not tabloid garbage, but a respectful look at Loren's life. And frankly, her life is reminiscent of a dramatic movie -- only it's for real, and larger than life.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest flaw is that it was written about thirty years ago, so it stops when Loren was only forty.

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement.ust a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well.

That's what \\"Summer\\" and \\"Ethan Frome\\" have in common, as they look at love, sex, marriage and the conventions of the 1800s. Put together, these novellas are utterly fascinating.<br /><br />\\"Ethan Frome\\" is the male half of a loveless marriage, with the fretful, fussy Zeena. Then Zeena's lovely cousin Mattie Silver comes to live with them, and she brings out a happier, more passionate side of Ethan. But when Mattie is sent away, Ethan must make a decision. He knows he can't stay in his horrible marriage, so will he run away with Mattie? Or will something worse happen?<br /><br />\\"Summer\\" shocked the 1917 public, with its frank-for-its-time look at a young woman's sexual awakening. It takes place in the New England village of North Dormer, where the young librarian Charity lives. But when Charity falls in love with an upper-class young rake named Lucius, she finds herself pregnant and unmarried -- a destructive combination in the 1900s.<br /><br />Edith Wharton gave unvarnished looks at social conventions throughout her career -- she doesn't judge, she just tells it how it was, whether she's talking about the Roaring 20s or the uptight Victorian era. Divorce was almost unthinkable, affairs scandalous if revealed, and women had the cards stacked against them in matters of love, marriage and sex.<br /><br />Both novellas also display Wharton's talent for writing characters who were totally unlike her, especially working-class heroes. Charity is an uneducated, naive, rough-mannered young woman, while Ethan is... well, male. Neither is much like Wharton, but she gets inside their heads and makes them entirely believable.<br /><br />Wharton's formal writing style is offset by the starkness of her stories -- if she took a hard look at Victorian social conventions, she didn't flinch from showing what happened to those that transgressed. (I'll give you a hint -- neither novella has a smooching-lovers-ride-off-into-the-sunset finale) It's realistic, but a bit depressing.<br /><br />\\"Summer\\" and \\"Ethan Frome\\" are both tales of love doomed by social conventions, and also two of Wharton's best stories. Sad and beautiful, gripping and classic.you a hint -- neither novella has a smooching-lovers-ride-off-into-the-sunset finale) It's realistic, but a bit depressing.  <br />  <br />\\"Summer\\" and \\"Ethan Frome\\" are both tales of love doomed by social conventions, and also two of Wharton's best stories.

And \\"About A Boy\\" is one of his best novels, with its sensitive looks not only at male fears, but at how they relate to women and children. It's a far smarter, wittier book than you'd think.<br /><br />Will is a single thirtysomething, self-absorbed and consumed with his own coolness, unattachedness and ability to live off his dad's song royalties. After dating single mom Angie, he realizes how to instantly give his sex life and image a boost: date single mothers, beautiful and desperate. So he invents a nasty ex-wife and a toddler son, and begins going to SPAT (Single Parents, Alone Together).<br /><br />But when he meets attractive Suzie, he also meets the boy she's babysitting -- Marcus, a troubled, intelligent preteen who is picked on at school. Marcus's home life isn't much better -- his depressed mother has just attempted suicide. Despite Will's commitment to noncommitment, he finds himself slipping into the role of father and friend for Marcus.<br /><br />Single moms, precocious kids, immature lads -- none of these things are terribly original. It's Hornby's way of handling them that is really original. And the way he wrote \\"About A Boy\\" gives unusual life to what could have been a TV-movie-of-the-week/lame-sitcom plot, with cliched characters.<br /><br />Instead, Hornby has created a surprisingly mature book, by showing a realistic portrayal of an immature man growing up whether he likes it or not. But Hornby's quietly insightful prose is a little less self-consciously cool than in \\"High Fidelity,\\" and it's also more focused on human experiences. And no, not just Will picking up single mums.<br /><br />Will is a pretty accurate portrayal of men who work hard at being immature -- believe me, he's accurate. And that makes it even more satisfying to see him graduating into adulthood. Marcus's chapters are deeper, however, and it's this pensive kid who grounds the book. He may be young, but thanks to his saddening life, his mind is a lot more mature than Will's.<br /><br />Postmodern Peter Pans and precocious preteens are at the heart of \\"About A Boy,\\" Nick Hornby's sensitive look at the sexes and their children.ounds the book.

Koji Suzuki could easily be considered the Stephen King of Japanese horror, with several movies (and remakes) of his bestseller novels -- particularly \\"Ring.\\" Yes, that one. The one where you die in a week after seeing the cursed tape. While not quite the same as either film, Suzuki's original novel is a quiet, understated horror classic.<br /><br />Four teenagers watch a seemingly cursed videotape, which will kill them in one week's time. Seven days later, all four die of heart attacks, including one young man simply keeling off his motorcycle. The uncle of one girl, Kazuyuki Asakawa, also finds the videotape and watches it. Now he has seven days to figure out the mysterious instructions, which happen to be missing. If he doesn't, he's dead.<br /><br />Accompanied by a less-than-pristine professor, Ryuji Takayama, Asakawa goes in search of what is going on -- he suspects a virus that causes a heart attack. As he goes hunting through the woods for the secret to the videotape, he discovers a legacy of death and terror, left behind by the malevolent Sadako Yamamura. Asakawa's time is running out -- how can he unravel the mystery of the Ring?<br /><br />Don't expect a carbon copy of the \\"Ring\\" movies: No TV apparitions, the lead is a man, and despite her beautiful female appearance, Sadako is a hermaphrodite. However, the \\"Ring\\" book is far more horrifying, solidifying Suzuki's position as a classic horror writer. It's impossible not to shiver when you look at the TV, after seeing this.<br /><br />Suzuki's skill is in calmly, coolly describing horrific events in simple words. It packs a more visceral punch than if he just had floods of blood and gore in detail. The scene where Takayama sees the curse working on his own body is enough to make your skin crawl. And as good horror writers do, he creates a horrific plot based on something everyday. It's so easy to set off the curse, and that is what is so terrifying.<br /><br />As Suzuki often does, he doesn't make his characters all sympathetic and noble. Asakawa is a cynical, rather self-absorbed man -- although this is what the plot hinges on -- and Takayama is a nihilistic rapist. It weakens the book slightly to not care much about either. Though in a way, the book is more about the \\"curse\\" -- which is more a virus -- and about Sadako than either of these men.<br /><br />Perhaps that's a part of Suzuki's subtle cultural critiques in here, as well as Japanese supernatural beliefs -- nensha, for example, which is how Sadako created the lethal tape -- and the male and female roles in society. Finally he takes a hard look at this question: Should you allow your loved ones and yourself to die, or risk contaminating the world with the lethal videotape?<br /><br />There's an almost apocalyptic note to the finale of \\"Ring,\\" although it resulted in two more books.

But Laurell K. Hamilton managed to create something a wee bit out of the ordinary in \\"Guilty Pleasures,\\" the first book of her Anita Blake series. Vampires, werebeasties and kick-butt policewomen abound, and the result is... yes, I'll say it: A guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Anita Blake, a petite smart-alecky vampire hunter/necromancer, is known as the \\"Exterminator,\\" and is feared by the vampires who have been lucky enough not to run into her. But at a bachelorette party, Anita is tricked into going to a vampire strip club, presided over by the sexy French vampire Jean-Claude. Soon a friend of hers is being held hostage. She'll stay alive if Anita works for the vampires.<br /><br />Jean-Claude takes her to see the master vampire, the malevolent little girl Nikolaos, who tells her that vampires are being brutally killed -- including some of the most powerful in St. Louis. Now Anita is racing against the clock to find the killer, and keep from being killed by the very vampires that she is there to help.<br /><br />The early books of the Anita Blake series are fun, sort of your typical detective stories with a bloodsucky twist. They also have the advantage of a strong female lead, some weird sidekicks, and a mild \\"freshening up\\" of your average dark fantasy/horror staples like vampires and werebeasties.<br /><br />There's not a lot of actual innovation here -- werecreatures, vampires, and petite heroines who kick their butts. And Jean-Claude and the girl-vampires Nikolaos seem suspiciously close to classic Anne Rice characters. And I can only read so many pages of Anita detailing every outfit and weapon she wears.<br /><br />However, Hamilton adds plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor; Anita has many of the best one-liners in the book, and there are some entertaining questions, such as whether a person can remarry if their dead spouse becomes a vampire. There are also some darker new twists, such as \\"freaks\\" (vampire junkies) and vampire groupies. The content is nothing new, but the handling is.<br /><br />Despite her nymphomaniacal turns later in the series, Anita is strong, tough and in charge here. Hamilton gave her plenty of insecurities, but also the guts to live and fight despite them. The other compelling character is Jean-Claude, who is the very image of an enigmatic vamp. It's never quite clear what he's thinking, but Hamilton hinted at the actual personality under his suave charm.reaks\\" (vampire junkies) and vampire groupies.

It was his life.\\" While those are the final words of Nicole Krauss's illuminating second novel, \\"The History of Love,\\" those three short sentences only highlight what I knew all along. This a unique book, haunting and quietly funny, and which leaves you thinking about memories, about death, and about love.<br /><br />Leo Gursky has a weak heart, and may die at any moment. Virtually no one knows him, and his own son never even knew of him; he drops his change and buys things, just so someone might remember him when he dies. Sixty years ago, he fled Nazi-occupied Poland to pursue a childhood sweetheart to America, but she thought he had died, and married someone else.<br /><br />Before that happened, Leo wrote a exquisite ode to her, called the \\"History of Love,\\" a fictional look at love's origins, its milestones, and at a mysterious girl called Alma. A copy of that book found its way into teenage Alma's household, and she was named after that mysterious woman. Now, as her grief-stricken mother translates one of the few copies into English, Alma sets out on a journey of discovery -- about the mystery author, the person who wants the translation, and the mysterious original Alma.<br /><br />Nicole Krauss writes much like her husband Jonathan Safran Foer -- she also takes a look at the past and present, at immigrants, and at the journies of our elders. And the insights she shows about the nature of love, and the intersections of life and literature, are startlingly deep. Many longtime authors can only dream of such delicate sensibilities.<br /><br />The writing itself is surprisingly fluid, considering that Krauss changes narrators and timeframes several times, and sometimes refers to one character by different names. She also changes her style, depending on the narrator -- the old man has a more rambly style, while Alma neatly compiles her thoughts into numbered lists.<br /><br />All the stories of death, loneliness and memories could be depressing. But Krauss injects them with gentle humor, such as Alma's brother Bird, who thinks he might be the Messiah (yeah, right, kid). There are also surprisingly poignant passages from the \\"History of Love\\" itself, which offer tiny insights into Leo's past love. Never sentimental, never maudlin. Just quietly, sadly romantic.<br /><br />\\"The History of Love\\" is a truly exquisite piece of work, an insightful novel that is both heartbreaking and heartwarming.

Judging by the swooning, cleavagey woman who seems to be in the initial stages of ecstacy, with a bit of soft purply lighting, \\"A Stroke of Midnight\\" looks like a fantastical romance novel. And that... is what it is.<br /><br />The cover aside, Laurell K. Hamilton's latest Merry Gentry novel is, like many of her latest novels, a minor disaster. \\"Stroke of Midnight\\" is actually better than most of them, with the complex political machinations that Hamilton is so good at. But smothering those machinations are sex and a glacial plotline.<br /><br />After the events of the third book, the human media has been called into the sithen for a press conference centering on Princess Meredith. But no sooner has the conference ended than a pair of corpses -- one human, one fey -- are found. Merry convinces the Queen to let her investigate the human way, and begins delving into whodunnit.<br /><br />To make things even more complex, the Goddess has been doing wonky things with Merry's powers -- now when she has sex with fey, their powers are reawakened, and then become godlike once more. Needless to say, this is doing lovely things for her obedient harem. But Merry also has to focus on the mysterious murders -- and the plot that may be forming against her aunt.<br /><br />Sounds intriguing? Well, in theory it is. Unfortunately, the entire plot is not only inundated in softcore porn, but it also takes place in about twenty-four hours. As a result, the plot is so drawn-out and glacially slow that I kept wanting to bang the book against my head.<br /><br />And, of course, the sex. Hamilton's writing has gotten downright nymphomaniacal in recent years, and \\"Stroke of Midnight\\" is no exception. There's virtually nobody Merry doesn't have elaborate and varied sex with, or hasn't had sex with in the past, except for close relatives. Really, she must have supernatural powers if she isn't walking funny by now.<br /><br />On a more serious note, though the sex has a part in the plot, it's so frequent and detailed that it all blurs together into one throbbing, ecstatic, orgasmic blur. These things are not Hamilton's strong point, and it sabotages the book to have so much of it made up by Merry's sexual gymnastics with men, women, fey, demi-fey, and anything else that walks and talks. (If she has sex to get pregnant, why women?)<br /><br />And the writing is much in the vein of the sex scenes -- boring, filleresque and rather uninvolving. This is probably because Hamilton is setting it in one day, no more, and so she has to flesh it out with a lot of repetitive dialogue and endless internal pondering. The more supernatural scenes are interesting, but they are also nothing new to readers of this series. And at the end, it merely feels like a teaser for book number five.<br /><br />What \\"Stroke of Midnight\\" does to redeem itself is revive some of those Machievellian power tangles. Sure, Cel is in his cell, but there is plenty of hostility and plotting. This is where Hamilton shines, and if there had been less sex and more plotting, this book might well have blosssomed.<br /><br />\\"A Stroke of Midnight\\" has a few steps in the right direction, but they are baby steps. In the end, it feels deeply unsatisfying, more suited for a drinking game (if Merry has sex with a weirdly-appendaged fey, take half a sip) than for serious fantasy reaidng.n a more serious note, though the sex has a part in the plot, it's so frequent and detailed that it all blurs together into one throbbing, ecstatic, orgasmic blur.

(No offense to you, Mr. Barry -- I love your work too). But, as \\"James Thurber: Writings and Drawings\\" demonstrates, the subtle approach worked just as well.<br /><br />Thurber wrote and drew so much during his lifetime that this book is actually not a full collection, but a sort of \\"Best of\\" collection. Thurber turns a satirical eye at sex, marriage, men who bark like dogs, old ladies who foretell doom, some rather dry little fables and spoofs, and a look at how the Civil War might have ended if Grant had been recovering from a bender. Not to mention the entire text of Thurber's children's novel, \\"The 13 Clocks,\\" a slightly twisted fantasy about a young prince who must rescue the Princess, with the help of the nonsense-spouting Golux (who is not a mere device).<br /><br />Admittedly, not all of them are strictly meant for humor -- \\"My Life and Hard Times\\" is a short, entertaining autobiography, without the excuses and ego trips that many autobiographies have. There are also bittersweet memories, such as the story of a faithful dog that Thurber had when he was very small.<br /><br />There are also quite a few pictures -- Thurber had a cute, rounded kind of style, without a lot of details. One example is \\"The Last Flower,\\" an anti-war parable in which after a devastating war, civilization falls and people forget everything, even love. Not all the cartoons are as quietly grim, however -- one is a man, woman and child romping through various obstacles together, as well as several standalone cartoons.<br /><br />\\"James Thurber: Writings and Drawings\\" shows Thurber off to best advantage. It's a great collection not only because Thurber was a wonderful humorist, but also because the pieces in here show the full range of what he could do. Included are humorous anecdotes, personal reflections, tributes, sad stories, fables fiction, and funny little cartoons -- it shows what a versatile writer he was. Not just a humorist, but a writer.<br /><br />And a cartoonist as well -- Thurber was able to draw entire picture books that had no set story, but could be interpreted as the reader wished. Most of his cartoons were more relaxed, with a sort of rounded, simplistic style that looks like he doodled them while he was thinking.<br /><br />\\"James Thurber: Writings and Drawings\\" is not only a good collection of this now-legendary writer's work, but a good introduction to Thurber as well.

Usually it's due to lackluster plot or writing, but Gene Stratton-Porter's disastrous \\"Her Father's Daughter\\" collapses under the weight of relentless racism. Good luck reading this one without getting mad.<br /><br />Linda Strong is the younger of two orphaned girls, but she's the \\"Cinderella\\" -- she has virtually no clothes, a tiny room, and is viewed as a tomboyish annoyance by her dainty sister Eileen, who uses most of the money for her own clothes, cosmetics and room. Despite this, she captures the heart of school hottie Donald, and entertains Eileen's male admirers.<br /><br />But Linda finally gets tired of living under Eileen's heel, and discovers that her late father's books are still bringing in royalties. With those and his old car, she begins a career as a nature writer. But even this new level of independence can't prepare Linda for what happens when her best friend Marion loses an important competition -- and when Eileen leaves, and her true parentage is revealed.<br /><br />None of that plotline is really a problem, although it's glaringly obvious from the start that Eileen and Linda are not really sisters. While it's hardly an original plot, Linda's movements toward independence are a unusual and rather refreshing, even if she does talk out loud to herself a lot.<br /><br />The storylines about Eileen's engagement and Marion's attempts to become an architect are also fairly entertaining, and show the differences between the traditional parlor flower and career women. And as she did in \\"Girl of the Limberlost,\\" Stratton-Porter brings the wild places of California to life as Linda hunts for wildlife and plants in the hills.<br /><br />The problem? Racism. A subplot runs under the story of Donald and Linda, where a Japanese immigrant is outstripping Donald scholastically. Stratton-Porter repeatedly states that she considered this unacceptable. As a final insult, she has the immigrant cheating -- implying that not only did she think it's unacceptable, but impossible. I wonder what Ms. Stratton-Porter would think of international test results now.<br /><br />That racist current also ruins the portrait of Linda as an intelligent, mature young woman. Her rantings about Caucasian dominance are maddening, as is one scene where she gets creative with paints and \\"fashioned huge storm clouds wind driven, that floated in such a manner as to bring the merest suggestionof menacing faces, black faces, yellow faces, brown faces.\\" A few of the supporting characters like tragic Marion are interesting, but Linda's poisonous attitude pretty much wrecks it all.<br /><br />The bare bones hint at a fun \\"Cinderella\\" sort of novel, but Gene Stratton-Porter's vitriolic attitude corrodes it to the point where you can't even skim past the bad bits.think it's unacceptable, but impossible.

While occasionally his lead character's \\"top five\\" lists can be a little annoying, this is a charmingly original, wry and thoughtful novel - an offbeat romance for our time.<br /><br />Rob owns a little music shop in London, which is a good thing because he is musically obsessed -- pop music, he claims, makes him fall in love. But even pop music can't heal his heart when his longtime girlfriend Laura breaks up and moves out. What's worse, Rob has no idea WHY she broke up with him, and he feels mixed feelings about losing her (he cares about her) and her musical tastes (bad).<br /><br />He immerses himself in his rickety business with his weirdo employees -- these guys alone are worth checking out the book for. He dates a folk singer. He learns that Laura is now involved with the repulsive guy upstairs. And finally, he assesses his past sex life and romances (the top five, specifically), getting a bit of insight into what Laura's problem with him might be: He's stuck in his mid-teens.<br /><br />Thirty-five is kind of old to start growing up. But like many real people, Rob learns that it's change or die -- in his case, alone and surrounded by records. \\"High Fidelity\\" is a nice blend of musical/movie memoir, love story and belated-coming-of-age tale. It's kind of geeky and pokes fun at itself, but therein lies its charm.<br /><br />Hornby writes a nice, breezy kind of prose, peppered with plenty of pop culture and musical references. Not to mention the top five lists: Top Five Episodes of Cheers. Best Side One Track Ones Of All Time. Top Five Bands or Musicians Who Will Have To Be Shot Come the Musical Revolution. At times the pop culture name-dropping gets a bit tiresome, but it mostly underlines how quirky and mildly obsessive Rob can be.<br /><br />And oh, he can be quirky. He can also be a self-centered jerk, and a bit confused and clueless to boot. Hornby's alter ego is likable for his flaws, and somehow manages to shed a little light on how men think. Good backup comes in his clerks Barry and Dick, who are just as geekily eccentric about music and lists as Rob is.<br /><br />Nick Hornby's \\"High Fidelity\\" is an excellent slice of Brit-lit -- it's quirky, wry, insightful, and a bit obsessed with good music. Definitely a must-read.d a bit confused and clueless to boot. Hornby's alter ego is likable for his flaws, and somehow manages to shed a little light on how men think.

In particular, it focuses on a virtuous young Roman man, Glaucus, who is stuck in a love quadrangle with a beautiful, equally virtuous young lady, a blind slave girl, and a sinister Egyptian who beguiles the lovely young lady.<br /><br />In the background is a turmoil of religious and social problems, with a deadly volcano smoldering behind it all. Then, a murder is committed -- and Glaucus is arrested for the crime, and sentenced to be sent into the arena. When Vesuvius blows, will any of them survive?<br /><br />\\"The Last Days of Pompeii\\" is one of those novels that had immense promise. Unfortunately, Bulwer-Lytton turns it into a Roman soap opera. Rather than focusing on the more interesting aspects of Pompeii, Bulwer-Lytton decided to focus on a contrived romantic web of very boring people.<br /><br />It doesn't help that \\"Last Days of Pompeii\\" is also written in a chokingly dense style, very ornate and full of bad poetry. The dialogue is even worse, with lines like, \\"'With all his conceit and extravagance he is not so rich, I fancy, as he affects to be, and perhaps loves to save his amphorae better than his wit.\\" Okay, whatever. The story might be more palatable, had Bulwer-Lytton not tried too hard -- many Victorian authors managed to communicate their stories without smothering the readers in faux-ancient prose.<br /><br />Bulwer-Lytton also seems to have been showing off his knowledge of Roman architecture and clothing, since the descriptions of the atrium and triclinium are more complex than any character. He regularly interrupted the narrative just to lecture readers on historical trivia, on everything from medieval necromancy to Italian herbs -- not just annoying, but often irrelevant to the story at hand.<br /><br />Apparently in the interest of keeping the novel \\"human,\\" Bulwer-Lytton introduced some romantic tension. Unfortunately, his characters don't act like real people -- really, who would fuss about their love lives while escaping from an erupting volcano that has killed hundreds and destroyed two cities? It's hard to imagine anyone so oblivious and self-absorbed, but the annoying blind slave Nydia apparently can't think of anything else.<br /><br />Glaucus is a paragon of virtue, despite what Romans of the time were like; he even converts to Christianity for no apparent reason, in keeping with the attempt to make him fit the Victorian ideal. On the flipside, Arbaces is a rather cartoonish -- even slightly racist -- villain, who is just there to make trouble because he wants to.<br /><br />\\"The Last Days of Pompeii\\" is an intriguing idea for a novel, but a flop as Edward Bulwer-Lytton actually wrote it.

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

It's part parody, part analysis. And while it's a bit weird, it's certainly worth reading.<br /><br />Wallace Stevens began publishing poetry at an importance time in writing history, when the older styles were falling away. But instead of ignoring one type of poetry in favor of another, he took the best of all kinds -- his verse combines Victorian opulance with the more modern free-form verse.<br /><br />Though he isn't as well known as Yeats or Williams, Stevens' poetry is one of the few kinds that is both technically good and emotionally rich. His poetry can be whimsical (\\"Every time the bucks went clattering/Over Oklahoma/A firecat bristled in the way\\"), but it is also meditative and philosophical, even tackling the nature of reality.<br /><br />If nothing else, Stevens' writing can be read just because it is exquisitely beautiful. He lavished details all over almost every poem he wrote; his style tends to be a bit on the ornate side -- Stevens freely uses the more exotic terms -- such as \\"opalescence,\\" \\"pendentives\\" and \\"muleteers\\" -- wrapped up in complex verse, sometimes with a rhyme scheme and sometimes free-form.<br /><br />\\"The Palm at the End of the Mind\\" is a wonderful collection of Wallace Stevens' most significant long poems, his underrated play, and his equally important smaller ones.

One staid family member, Soames Forsyte, becomes obsessed with the beautiful but poor Irene, and finally gets her to marry him -- on condition that if their marriage doesn't work, she walks. Well, their marriage doesn't work. Soames is frustrated that Irene shuts him out of her life and her bed -- even more so when he learns that she is in love with sexy, arty architect Bosinney, who is building them a new house.<br /><br />Soames rapes Irene and ruins Bosinney.

Tolstoy's story of lovers and family is interlaced with razor-sharp social commentary and odd moments that are almost transcendent. In other words, this is a masterpiece.<br /><br />When Stepan Oblonsky has an affair with the governess, his wife says that she's leaving him, and now the family is about to disintegrate. Stepan's sister Anna arrives to smooth over their marital problems, and consoles his wife Dolly until she agrees to stay. But on the train there, she met the outspoken Countess Vronsky, and the countess's dashing son, who is semi-engaged to Dolly's sister Kitty.<br /><br />Anna and Vronsky start to fall in love -- despite the fact that Anna has been married for ten years, to a wealthy husband she doesn't care about, and has a young son. Even so, Anna rejects her loveless marriage and becomes the center of scandal and public hypocrisy, and even becomes pregnany by Vronsky. As she prepares to jump ship and get a divorce, Anna becomes a victim of her own passions...<br /><br />That isn't the entire story, actually -- Tolstoy weaves in other plots, about disintegrating families, new marriages, and the melancholy Levin's constant search for God, truth, and goodness. Despite the grim storyline about adultery, and the social commentary, there's an almost transcendent quality to some of Tolstoy's writing. It's the most optimistic tragic book I've ever read.<br /><br />For some reason, Tolstoy called this his \\"first novel,\\" even though he had already written some before that. Perhaps it's because \\"Anna Karenina\\" tackles so many questions and themes, and does so without ever dropping the ball. No wonder it's so long and imposing -- Tolstoy covered a lot of ground in here.<br /><br />And while \\"Anna Karenina\\" was not the first book he wrote, it is probably the deepest and most moving. Tolstoy steeps the book in social commentary, and his personal philosophies. It's also one of those books that takes a very long time to move itself forward -- Tolstoy's writing is slow and ponderous, with a lot of serious discussion about religion and relationships. But his intense, slightly rough writing is worth it.<br /><br />In some tragic books, you get the feeling that the author really despises his characters, and doesn't really care what happens to them. Tolstoy never gives you that feeling -- no matter how annoying his characters are, they always have something interesting or endearing. No caricatures at all -- even Anna's irritating, arrogant brother is given some quirks to make him seem real.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the most moving character here is not Anna, but Konstantin Levin -- the tortured, passionate landowner is so earnest that it's difficult not to care about him. Apparently he was Tolstoy's alter ego, which explains his depth. But Anna and Vronsky are strong leads, a passionate pair who are both selfish and seductive, but never boring.<br /><br />A beautiful look at living right vs. living wrong, \\"Anna Karenina\\" is a truly magnificent book.

As if moving and being asthmatic wasn't bad enough, now he has had two nightmarish adventures, and dealt with the malevolent Morrow Days. In the third book of Garth Nix's dark fantasy series, \\"Drowned Wednesday,\\" Nix spins his best story yet in this series.<br /><br />Arthur and his pal Leaf are recuperating from the strange events of Monday and Tuesday... until suddenly the hospital is flooded. Leaf is abducted by a strange boat, and Arthur finds himself adrift on the Border Sea, on a hospital bed. After he's picked up by a shipful of friendly Salvagers, he finds that he's inadvertantly become the target for the malevolent pirate Feverfew, a mortal-turned-Denizen on a ship of bone.<br /><br />He also encounters Drowned Wednesday, who has invited him to lunch. But unlike Grim Tuesday and Mister Monday, Wednesday needs his help, because she is cursed: she takes the form of a whale, and has a monstrous appetite. She's willing to give him the Key, but he has to deal with the malevolent Feverfew first, and rescue Leaf. Unfortunately to do that, he will have to take a rescue submarine to a seaport... which happens to be inside Wednesday's stomach.<br /><br />For some reason, after the publication of \\"Grim Tuesday,\\" the publishers decided to halt production and rerelease the two previous books in hardcover. As a result, \\"Drowned Wednesday\\" took forever to come out. Fortunately, it was worth the wait: as writing and characters go, \\"Drowned Wednesday\\" beats the second book and equals the first.<br /><br />\\"Drowned Wednesday\\" more or less fits the mold of the previous novels: Arthur deals with the strange residents (rats and Denizens) of the various worlds, while trying to avoid being killed. It sounds grim, but Nix spices it up with plenty of humor, such as the stamp-collecting Salvager captain. One of the funniest moments has Arthur looking at a book about his adventures, which shows him as a buff action hero.<br /><br />Fortunately, Nix keeps the story from getting formulaic by giving new twists to the story.

This two-disc CD, \\"Beyond Baroque Live 2,\\" permanently captured a very unique night there, for anyone who unluckily was not there at the time. (Myself included)<br /><br />In November of 2003, a number of noted poets and authors came together at Beyond Baroque for two reasons: One was to raise money for the gone-but-not-forgotten Midnight Special Bookstore. The other was to commemorate Mark Eleveld's deeply interesting \\"Spoken Word Revolution: Slam, Hip Hop & The Poetry Of A New Generation.\\"<br /><br />Ignoring for the moment the good intentions, this collection is a treat for poetry buffs. Poet/actor/painter/activist Viggo Mortensen opens the event, and is followed by Eleveld's short'n'sweet recitation of a Billy Collins poem. Both, incidently, are involved in the publishing companies that jointly released this collection, so it somehow seems appropriate that they kicked off the night.<br /><br />Among the others who recite are Poet Laureate Marvin Bell, Pulitzer nominee Patricia Smith, and slam poetry heavyweights such as Mike McGee and Regie Gibson.  Mortensen also recites poetry in a rich, flowing voice, such as his exceptional \\"Back to Babylon,\\" \\"Lullaby\\" and \\"First Light.<br /><br />It's somehow comfortable and humbling to listen to this CD. There aren't any biases or barriers; there are artists of all stripes, and different types of poetry on parade. Gritty, bittersweet, a bit sentimental (Smith's contribution) and all around intriguing. What's more, it feels like you are sitting in a chair up at the front row, listening to these people recite.<br /><br />If you were unable to attend the November 2003 recitation (as most people weren't) then \\"Beyond Baroque Live 2\\" lets you hear it all. And what's even better, you can go back and listen to that rich night again.	2005-04-13

This time around, McKiernan takes another well-beloved fairy tale (\\"Sleeping Beauty\\") and gives it a a rework, this time with tighter writing, tighter plotting, and a very likable hero.<br /><br />While napping at Summerwood Manor, Borel has a dream about a young woman in a tower, surrounded by knives and blindfolded. Searching for an answer to who she is and what trouble she is in, he goes to the seemingly abandoned cottage of an evil witch. By reading her diary, he manages to find out that she is Chelle (Michelle), the daughter of his father's old pal.<br /><br />Accompanied by a sassy Sprite, Flic, and his bumblebee Buzzer, Borel sets off across Faery to find Chelle and set her free. Every night he encounters her in his dreams, without her knowledge that it's only a dream, and tries to figure out where she is and who has taken her captive. To learn where she is, Borel will deal with tricky faerie kings and spectral rider, and even the Fates. But he has only one month to find Chelle, and not many clues to go on...<br /><br />After the sugary heroine of \\"Once Upon A Winter's Night,\\" the down-to-earth Borel is a relief. He was one of the more interesting minor characters of that first book, and it's nice to see him getting his own book. This time around, it's not initially as obvious what fairy tale McKiernan is retelling, and he manages to keep up the suspense about the daggers, squeaking and other odd clues that come together at the finale.<br /><br />With only a month to deal with the wicked witch and damsel in distress, the plot goes quite fast, and has some genuinely creepy scenes, such as when Borel is captured by trolls. The book does sag somewhat in the middle, and also retreads old ground by having Borel deal with each of the rather pompous Fates in turn -- something Camille did in the previous book.<br /><br />However, McKiernan's writing has improved a great deal. The plot is sparer and leaner, with virtually no side trips or red herrings. So is his writing; he throws in a few discussions about love and sex, but not enough to sabotage the suspense. And he reveals quite a few little tidbits about the forthcoming Great Epic Struggle against The Evil Force, leaving some enormous plot threads dangling at the end. (Not to mention name-dropping some future villains for our heroes to fight)<br /><br />While it has some flaws, \\"Once Upon A Summer Day\\" is a tighter, faster read than its predecessor.

And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.<br /><br />Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).<br /><br />So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.<br /><br />Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" --  especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.<br /><br />The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster -- not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime. Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but complex and sometimes menacing.<br /><br />\\"The Hobbit\\" was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and continue reading.

That's what \\"Summer\\" and \\"Ethan Frome\\" have in common, as they look at love, sex, marriage and the conventions of the 1800s. Put together, these novellas are utterly fascinating.<br /><br />\\"Ethan Frome\\" is the male half of a loveless marriage, with the fretful, fussy Zeena. Then Zeena's lovely cousin Mattie Silver comes to live with them, and she brings out a happier, more passionate side of Ethan. But when Mattie is sent away, Ethan must make a decision. He knows he can't stay in his horrible marriage, so will he run away with Mattie? Or will something worse happen?<br /><br />\\"Summer\\" shocked the 1917 public, with its frank-for-its-time look at a young woman's sexual awakening. It takes place in the New England village of North Dormer, where the young librarian Charity lives. But when Charity falls in love with an upper-class young rake named Lucius, she finds herself pregnant and unmarried -- a destructive combination in the 1900s.<br /><br />Edith Wharton gave unvarnished looks at social conventions throughout her career -- she doesn't judge, she just tells it how it was, whether she's talking about the Roaring 20s or the uptight Victorian era. Divorce was almost unthinkable, affairs scandalous if revealed, and women had the cards stacked against them in matters of love, marriage and sex.<br /><br />Both novellas also display Wharton's talent for writing characters who were totally unlike her, especially working-class heroes. Charity is an uneducated, naive, rough-mannered young woman, while Ethan is... well, male. Neither is much like Wharton, but she gets inside their heads and makes them entirely believable.<br /><br />Wharton's formal writing style is offset by the starkness of her stories -- if she took a hard look at Victorian social conventions, she didn't flinch from showing what happened to those that transgressed. (I'll give you a hint -- neither novella has a smooching-lovers-ride-off-into-the-sunset finale) It's realistic, but a bit depressing.<br /><br />\\"Summer\\" and \\"Ethan Frome\\" are both tales of love doomed by social conventions, and also two of Wharton's best stories.

Tolstoy's story of lovers and family is interlaced with razor-sharp social commentary and odd moments that are almost transcendent. In other words, this is a masterpiece.<br /><br />When Stepan Oblonsky has an affair with the governess, his wife says that she's leaving him, and now the family is about to disintegrate. Stepan's sister Anna arrives to smooth over their marital problems, and consoles his wife Dolly until she agrees to stay. But on the train there, she met the outspoken Countess Vronsky, and the countess's dashing son, who is semi-engaged to Dolly's sister Kitty.<br /><br />Anna and Vronsky start to fall in love -- despite the fact that Anna has been married for ten years, to a wealthy husband she doesn't care about, and has a young son. Even so, Anna rejects her loveless marriage and becomes the center of scandal and public hypocrisy, and even becomes pregnany by Vronsky. As she prepares to jump ship and get a divorce, Anna becomes a victim of her own passions...<br /><br />That isn't the entire story, actually -- Tolstoy weaves in other plots, about disintegrating families, new marriages, and the melancholy Levin's constant search for God, truth, and goodness. Despite the grim storyline about adultery, and the social commentary, there's an almost transcendent quality to some of Tolstoy's writing. It's the most optimistic tragic book I've ever read.<br /><br />For some reason, Tolstoy called this his \\"first novel,\\" even though he had already written some before that. Perhaps it's because \\"Anna Karenina\\" tackles so many questions and themes, and does so without ever dropping the ball. No wonder it's so long and imposing -- Tolstoy covered a lot of ground in here.<br /><br />And while \\"Anna Karenina\\" was not the first book he wrote, it is probably the deepest and most moving. Tolstoy steeps the book in social commentary, and his personal philosophies. It's also one of those books that takes a very long time to move itself forward -- Tolstoy's writing is slow and ponderous, with a lot of serious discussion about religion and relationships. But his intense, slightly rough writing is worth it.<br /><br />In some tragic books, you get the feeling that the author really despises his characters, and doesn't really care what happens to them. Tolstoy never gives you that feeling -- no matter how annoying his characters are, they always have something interesting or endearing. No caricatures at all -- even Anna's irritating, arrogant brother is given some quirks to make him seem real.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the most moving character here is not Anna, but Konstantin Levin -- the tortured, passionate landowner is so earnest that it's difficult not to care about him. Apparently he was Tolstoy's alter ego, which explains his depth. But Anna and Vronsky are strong leads, a passionate pair who are both selfish and seductive, but never boring.<br /><br />A beautiful look at living right vs. living wrong, \\"Anna Karenina\\" is a truly magnificent book. This book is undoubtedly Tolstoy's opus, and a stunning look at human nature.ote, it is probably the deepest and most moving.

In \\"The Age of Innocence,\\" Wharton took readers on a trip through the stuffy upper crust of 1870s New York, wrapped up in a hopeless love affair.<br /><br />Newland Archer, of a wealthy old New York family, has become engaged to pretty, naive May. But as he tries to get their wedding date moved up, he becomes acquainted with May's exotic cousin, Countess Olenska, who has returned home after dumping her cheating count husband. At first, the two are friends, but then they become something more.<br /><br />After Newland marries May, the attraction to the mysterious Countess and her free, unconventional life becomes even stronger. He starts to rebel in little ways, but he's still mired in a 100% conventional marriage, job and life. Will he become an outcast and go away with the beautiful countess, or will he stick with May and a safe, dull life?<br /><br />There's nothing too scandalous about \\"Age of Innocence\\" in a time when J.Lo acquires and discards boyfriends and husbands like old pantyhose. Probably it wasn't in the 1920s, when the book was first published. But this isn't a book to read if you appreciate sexiness and steam -- instead it's a social satire, a bittersweet romance, and a look at what happens when human beings lose all spontaneity and passion.<br /><br />Wharton brings old New York to life in this book -- opulent, beautiful, cultured, yet empty and kind of boring. It is \\"where the real thing was never said or done or even thought,\\" so tied up in tradition that nobody there really lives. And even though the unattainable countess is beautiful and sweet, it becomes obvious after awhile that Newland is actually in love with the idea of breaking out of his conventional life.<br /><br />Wharton's writing is a bit like a giant rosebud -- it takes forever to fully open. So don't be discouraged by the endless conversations about flowers, ballrooms and gloves. Wharton put them in to illustrate her point about New York at that time, and all the stories about different families, scandals and customs are actually very important.<br /><br />Newland seems like a rather boring person, since he only has brief bursts of individuality. But he gets more interesting when he struggles between his conscience and his longing for freedom. May is (suitably) pallid and a bit dull, while the Countess is alluringly mysterious and unconsciously rebellious. The fact that she doesn't TRY to rebel makes her far more interesting than Newland.<br /><br />\\"Age of Innocence\\" considered a story about a man in love with an unattainable woman, but it's also about that man straining against a stagnant, hypocritical society.

The result is a gloriously witty social satire.<br /><br />It opens with two young women departing from a ladies' academy: dull, sweet Amelia (rich) and fiery sharp-witted Rebecca (poor). Becky Sharp is a relentless social climber, and her first effort to rise \\"above her station\\" is by trying to get Amelia's brother to marry her -- an effort thwarted by Amelia's fiancee. So instead she gets married to another family's second son, Rawdon Crawley.<br /><br />Unfortunately, both young couples quickly get disinherited and George is killed. But Becky is determined to live the good life she has worked and married for -- she obtains jewels and money from admiring gentlemen, disrupting her marriage. But a little thing like a tarnished reputation isn't enough to keep Becky down...<br /><br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is actually a lot more complex than that, with dozens of little subplots and complicated character relationships. Reading it a few times is necessary to really absorb all of it, since it is not just a look at the two women in the middle of the book, but at the upper (and sometimes lower) social strata of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />The main flaw of the book is perhaps that it sprawls too much -- there's always a lot of stuff going on, not to mention a huge cast of characters, and Thackeray sometimes drops the ball when it comes to the supporting characters and their little plots. It takes a lot of patience to absorb all of this. However... it's worth it.<br /><br />Like most nineteenth-century writers, Thackeray had a very dense, formal writing style -- but once you get used to it, his writing becomes insanely funny. Witticisms and quips litter the pages, even if you don't pick them all up at once. At first Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.<br /><br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her. Certainly life hasn't been fair for her. Next to Becky, a goody-goody character like Amelia is pretty boring, and even the unsubtle George can't measure up to Becky.<br /><br />To sum up \\"Vanity Fair\\": think a period soap opera with a heavy dose of social commentary. In other words, it doesn't get much better than this, Thackeray's masterpiece..

That is at the heart of Tatum O'Neal's autobiography \\"A Paper Life\\" -- but the book itself has an uncomfortable bent, even as it unflinchingly looks at her life, her marriage, and her drug addictions.<br /><br />Tatum's parents were a quickly-divorced couple, who managed to produce two kids in less than a year before they split. Tatum and her brother Griffin lived with their addicted, neglectful mother for several years, before the young girl (and not her brother) was swept away by her dad, Ryan O'Neal. But life with Ryan wasn't the paradise she thought it would be: He was abusive and a blatant womanizer, with amours ranging from Bianca Jagger to Farrah Fawcett to Ursula Andress.<br /><br />Tatum soon became a star in her own right, even winning an Oscar for her role in the movie \\"Paper Moon\\" -- which only made Ryan resent her more. After breaking loose of her father, she married tennis star John McEnroe and had three children, but his volatile temper and her escalating drug addiction almost destroyed her life.<br /><br />How I fell to the bottom of the food chain and yet dragged myself back up -- that type of memoir is usually a bit of an uplift. And it's remarkable that O'Neal was able to undergo many of the experiences she did, and still be alive to talk about it, even if her life is apparently still far from perfect.<br /><br />O'Neal gives an unvarnished, unromanticized look at Hollywood and the life of a child star, especially one who was forced to grow up before she was emotionally ready to. Stars such as Melanie Griffith (a fling of her father's) and Michael Jackson (back when he looked human) show up in the pages briefly during her adolescent years, and O'Neal pulls no punches.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"A Paper Life\\" isn't quite an autobiography. It feels more like eavesdropping on a private therapy session; a catharsis on paper. That focus on the negative is certainly understandable -- O'Neal was an abused child, a neglected one who searched for parental figures. Her life was undoubtedly rotten for a long time.<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with revealing that side, with all its phantom pain and blood, but after awhile it gets rather uncomfortable to read only the bad, never the good, and the intense focus that every fight or attack has. The only good experiences that Tatum relates are linked to the terrible ones, such as living temporarily with Cher because of her rotten home life.<br /><br />\\"A Paper Life\\" brutally rips away the veils, revealing Tatum O'Neal's difficult life.

While C. David Heymann's \\"Liz: An Intimate Biography of Elizabeth Taylor\\" is not the worst of the bunch, his obvious disdain makes for sour reading.<br /><br />For some time, Elizabeth Taylor was the image of the child star -- talented, gutsy and willing to do almost anything (even try to speed up physical growth) to get a part. But after a failed marriage to hotel heir Nicky Hilton and an increasingly sultry image, Elizabeth began to change radically. Suddenly she was the Cleopatra of the times.<br /><br />She went through several marriages, to Michael Wilding, the tragic Mike Todd, a scandalous affair and marriage to Eddie Fisher (who was married), and finally spent many long years with the tempestuous Richard Burton (who was also married), whom she married twice. Her once red-hot career went into decline, as her last two forgettable marriages tanked. But Elizabeth Taylor remains a towering movie legend even today.<br /><br />Since she was the J.Lo of her day -- bling, lots of husbands and opulence all around -- Taylor is a pretty juicy subject for a biographer... IF the biographer can repress his inner tabloid journalist. Heymann keeps himself restrained much of the time, focusing a lot of Elizabeth's career and the impact of the people around her.<br /><br />It's death to a biography if the author has no respect, let alone liking, for his subject. And Heymann shows nothing but disdain not only for Elizabeth, but for her husbands and lovers. He emphasizes Taylor's yoyoing obesity, her sometimes immaturity, her gaudy dress/makeup/jewelry styles, and her lack of education. Her husbands are all caricatures. For example, Richard Burton is portrayed merely as a weak sot, and little mention is made of his intelligence, his eloquence, or his astounding acting ability.<br /><br />Aside from the superficiality and occasional sexual anecdotes, Heymann does a pretty good job of chronicling not only Taylor's career, but that of the people around her such as her good friends Rock Hudson and Montgomery Clift, as well as her tireless crusading for AIDS victims and her forays into the world of... perfume. Whatever. Nothing new is revealed, but it's a passable look at her life.<br /><br />However, the obvious dislike Heymann has for Taylor and her assorted amours makes \\"Liz: An Intimate Biography of Elizabeth Taylor\\" a pain to read.ality and occasional sexual anecdotes, Heymann does a pretty good job of chronicling not only Taylor's career, but that of the people around her such as her good friends Rock Hudson and Montgomery Clift, as well as her tireless crusading for AIDS victims and her forays into the world of... perfume.

Now that all the extended versions are out, and everybody knows the ending, this Best Of collection proves itself to be just as useful as Russell's previous books.<br /><br />As the previous books have had, Russell takes a look at all sorts of concept art for the films: There are storyboards, intricate pencil drawings, paintings, and action shots. Some of it was previously unreleased, like a picture of Gandalf the Grey looking over an army. Quite a few of the pictures are almost identical to the film, especially the digital shots, which are 100% realistic. And there is even a gallery of maquette models, including trolls, Shelob, mumakil, Treebeard, the king of the dead and the intricate Easterling armor.<br /><br />The difference between this and Russell's prior books? Here, Russell divides the artwork by artist, rather than by subject. As a result, readers can get a better idea on what the assorted artists specialized at, and their different concepts about what \\"Lord of the Rings\\" should look like.<br /><br />First and foremost are the legendary Alan Lee and John Howe. Lee's artwork is very vivid and action-based, and his color pictures are almost like photos. Howe's are mostly black and white, extremely detailed, and are more delicate than Lee's more muscular style. Without a doubt, these guys were the bedrock for all the concept art.<br /><br />But there are quite a few other artists included, and each has their own style and focus. Christian Rivers and Ben Wootten seemed to specialize in armor, beasties and menaces, while Warren Mahy tended to focus on the grotesque and gruesome, such as the orcs, the dead men, and uruk-hai. And Daniel Falconer did a little of everything, including ship designs, radically different designs for the ent Treebeard, and lots and lots of armor (both past and present).<br /><br />Russell ends it with small shots of the ending credits of ROTK, which was made of delicate pictures of each actor in costume, as \\"we would wish to remember them.\\" It's a bit saddening, but as he reminds us in the foreword, there's always \\"The Hobbit\\" someday.or (both past and present). <br /> <br />Russell ends it with small shots of the ending credits of ROTK, which was made of delicate pictures of each actor in costume, as \\"we would wish to remember them.\\" It's a bit saddening, but as he reminds us in the foreword, there's always \\"The Hobbit\\" someday.	2005-04-07

As first-of-a-series books go, this is a keeper.<br /><br />Ten years ago, Septimus Heap died in infancy. And on the same day, his father Silas Heap found a baby girl, and was instructed by the new ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia to raise her as his own. Ten years later, Marcia reveals that the girl Jenna is actually the future queen of that land. But she's in danger, and now a spy has found out where the girl lives.<br /><br />Marcia tries to spirit Jenna to safety, but now nowhere is safe -- an Assassin, a Hunter, and the apprentice to an evil wizard are sent after them. Now Marcia, Silas, Jenna, the ghost of the wizard Althus, and a mysterious young boy are on the run. But not everyone is as they seem, and a boy claiming to be Septimus Heap may not be him at all...<br /><br />The first few chapters of \\"Magyk\\" aren't too promising, since Sage's writing seems to be stuck in \\"picture book\\" mode. But when she gets to the present-day antics of the Heap family, she has settled comfortably into the writing groove. (Comfortable enough to even drop a blink-and-you'll-miss-it homage to J.R.R. Tolkien)<br /><br />Sage's writing is solid enough, with enough details to keep the spare narrative from seeming colorless. Lots of goofy clothes, offhand humor, splashy magic and interesting characters are sprinkled throughout the book. Sage's style reminds one of Diana Wynne-Jones' early work, and her interesting magical (magykal?) systems and wizardly hierarchy seem to back that up.<br /><br />Who's the main character? Hard to tell, since much of the action focuses on lost princess Jenna, but the focus shifts gradually to Boy 412 (as he is called until the last pages). Marcia is probably the most interesting character there -- dignified, a little haughty, very powerful, and sometimes overly concerned about how her clothes look.<br /><br />\\"Septimus Heap Book One: Magyk\\" is a promising start for a new series, but is a good book when read on its own.

While it may wear the trappings of that fiction, her second novel \\"High Maintenance\\" is darker, edgier, funnier, grittier, and far more original and fulfilling, a weird take on the traditional coming-of-age tale.<br /><br />Liv Kellerman has just left her husband.... and their luxurious apartment. Now she misses the apartment more than her marriage. After working briefly for a blind judge, Liv decides to try her hand at real estate -- and quickly discovers that she's a natural. Except she's distracted by her lovesick lesbian boss, a rundown tenement, and new boyfriend Andrew who is still living with another woman. Oh yes, and he likes to chew on her ear when they have sex.<br /><br />After her boss gets a bit too lovesick (and slightly nuts) for her taste, Liv moves to a better real estate agency, but her life is still in something of an uproar. Andrew is beginning to act weird, and her new clients are not much better -- even asking her to donate ova. When she finds out more about her boyfriend, Liv takes matters into her own hands to achieve the life -- and home -- that she has always longed for.<br /><br />Woman leaves no-good husband, forges new life and career alone, finds new boyfriend -- chick-lit, right? Wrong. \\"High Maintenance\\" avoids the obvious story twists in favor of zany characters and increasingly strange situations. Especially since -- unlike many authors, Belle doesn't seem to think that a hunky boyfriend is the ultimate goal. Happiness (or at least contentment) is.<br /><br />Considering the story's beginning, \\"High Maintenance\\" could've easily been depressing. However, Belle's insightful writing and peculiar scenarios keep things spicy and remarkably funny. She writes matter-of-factly in scenes such as a bathtub (complete with occupant) crashing through a restaurant ceiling, or Liv rushing to a vet's office after Andrew bites off part of her ear.<br /><br />Liv herself seems like a remarkably real person -- she keeps trying and persevering, even when living in a ratty tenement and working out of an office in a crack-filled slum. While her affair with the cheating ear-biter is annoying, the way she breaks it off -- complete with gun and Mid-Eastern cab driver -- is hilarious.<br /><br />Belle is particularly good with supporting characters, such as the blind judge, the wronged wife, the crazy apartment-hunters. Yes, they are all weird. But they also seem completely real, as if they could really exist. What is more, her love for New York -- and yes, New Yorkers -- shines through, in passages such as Liv's trip to the Empire State Building.<br /><br />Funny, dark and sometimes bizarre, \\"High Maintenance\\" is a remarkably funny, unusual novel.

And he will be known for nothing else, apparently. At least, he won't be remembered for \\"Madonna,\\" a quickie biography that covers no new ground and -- horrors! -- makes a once-controversial pop icon... boring.<br /><br />Madonna Louisa Ciccone started off as a motherless child, whose mom (also called Madonna) died of breast cancer. But she rapidly turned from pitiful to outrageous, travelling to NYC to become a dancer. Instead, she became a blossoming singer, an aspiring actress, and one of the first big stars to grace MTV.<br /><br />But more than her music was the controversy that surrounded her: Madonna dated men such as Michael Jackson, JFK Jr., Prince, and then-hot rapper Vanilla Ice, and married actor Sean Penn, while still pursuing relationships with other men and women. After their tumultuous union fell apart, she created the then-shocking book \\"Sex,\\" the peak of her sexually-charged career. But then her life took a more domestic turn, with children, marriage and religion (in about that order).<br /><br />It's not hard to have an opinion on Madonna -- either you love her or hate her. But if the only exposure to Madonna was through this book, it would be difficult to decide which. Morton paints Madonna in bland hues, describing her exploits, affairs and then-shocking concerts in the most uninspired prose imaginable. However, not once does he reveal anything new -- despite input from lovers and friends, Morton can only add detail to what people already knew.<br /><br />There are some interesting facets of her rise to stardom, particularly how she and her pals changed the NYC club life, and the odd details of her first recordings. For example, she wasn't pictured on her first album, in the hopes that she would be thought to be black. But once we get back to Madonna's personal life, things get dull.<br /><br />Morton himself seems to presume too much on his knowledge of Madonna: he constantly claims that she was miserable, depressed, et cetera. Apparently he disapproves of her wild past. Entertainingly, he claims that Madonna is just a \\"Catholic girl who wants to get married.\\" If that is how \\"just Catholic girls\\" live, then I want to know why I'm not having that much fun.<br /><br />Yet, at the same time, he glosses over most of her present, peaceful, monogamous life -- when she gets involved with Guy Ritchie and has her second child, he loses interest and crams the last several years into a matter of pages. One would think that her first solid relationship and her children would be worthy of a little more attention.<br /><br />Nobody expected Pulitzer-worthy journalism in \\"Madonna.\\" But surely Andrew Morton could have done better than a tepid recounting of what her fans already knew.hat she was miserable, depressed, et cetera.

And it's the center of \\"Dark Water,\\" Koji Suzuki's collection of short stories. While the now-legendary \\"Ring\\" author has a knack for visceral horror, he just isn't in his element when writing shorts.<br /><br />The most prominent story is \\"Floating Water,\\" which has already been made into the film \\"Honogurai mizu no soko kara\\" and is being remade for American audiences, starring Jennifer Connelly. Newly-divorced Yoshimi and her daughter Ikuko move into a run-down apartment building, where a little girl vanished two years before.<br /><br />But Suzuki doesn't descend to cheap ghosts here. Ikuko finds a \\"Hello Kitty\\" bag, which Yoshimi forces her to get rid of. But the bag keeps reappearing on the roof, and Ikuko has started talking with an imaginary playmate. Yoshimi starts to wonder -- what happened to that little girl, and where is she now, if she is haunting the building?<br /><br />The other short stories continue the \\"water\\" theme: a young teacher discovers a cruel friend left something on an abandoned island. An abusive fisherman finds that he did something terrible while he was drunk -- and his victim takes her revenge. Spelunkers, boats and sailors take parts in the other stories... always near water.<br /><br />Koji Suzuki is rightly called Japan's answer to Stephen King. In fact, he may well be better than King is. Where other horror authors use cheap chills and gore, Suzuki's stark storytelling keeps it clean. He frightens us with cruelty, with delusions, with looming curses, and with ghosts that the lead characters never actually see.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Dark Water's\\" short stories just don't gel. Suzuki doesn't get any time to build up suspense or character development, making the stories feel hollow. And most of them -- most glaringly the first -- ends abruptly. It's like walking down a sidewalk, only to suddenly fall into a pit. Perhaps only \\"The Hold,\\" one of the most unpleasant stories, has a satisfying finale.<br /><br />However, Suzuki's excellent style makes it worth reading. Everything and everyone is muted and understated, except for the sense of impending disaster and/or suspense hanging over each story. If fans of Suzuki read it solely for his style, then this is definitely a winner.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Dark Water\\" is not up to the standards of Suzuki's full-length novels.

Because \\"Rock Bottom: Dark Moments in Music Babylon\\" is merely another tepid recounting of rock'n'roll's worst moments, and it isn't elevated by Des Barres' own recollections.<br /><br />The theme is addiction, jail time and death -- most world-famous rockers have encountered at least one of the above. Des Barres explores the lives (and often deaths) of famed rockers like the doomed Jim Morrison, Queen's Freddie Mercury, the cruel Rick James, wild man John Bonham, equally wild Keith Moon, and many others. Her tales stretch from the early days of rock'n'roll to the early 1990s, but few things actually change.<br /><br />Sadly, Des Barres doesn't add anything to the telling of rock'n'roll's tale. Her recountings are mostly compressed biographies, with no new revelations or insights. Okay, we know Morrison could be a boor. We know Sid Vicious descended into heroin addiction. Yada yada -- it reads like a collection of magazine tributes.<br /><br />She also tries to inject herself into the book, which only unbalances it. It's a bit weird to hear distant third-person accounts, then hear detailed \\"I\\" accounts. Her accounts aren't terribly interesting either -- somehow hearing about her peeping-tammy antics, watching Brian Jones with two girls, is creepy rather than enlightening.<br /><br />Des Barres' writing does not make up for the lack of new information. At best, it's ordinary. At worst, it includes lines like \\"I could feel my own swelling love-pump pressing against my rib cage.\\" Too many chapters are filled with unwarranted hero-worship, no matter how deteriorated, depraved or deranged the stars were. Apparently it's in line with Des Barres' idea that a REAL rock star must be arrested, addicted and cause headlines with weird antics.<br /><br />A lack of new info and a tepid writing style bog down \\"Rock Bottom: Dark Moments In Music Babylon,\\" a failed attempt at a serious rock'n'roll book.

Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" a dark-edged little novel about teen disaffection. Wry, cynical and strangely touching at times, this book is a look into the confusion and turmoil of a young mind -- those who want their teens clean-cut and meek need not apply.<br /><br /> Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from a prep school for failing almost every subject he was studying. And he couldn't care less -- after all, it's full of phonies. Over the weekend, Holden wanders the streets of New York, thinking about the school, the teachers, the phonies, and his nebulous family -- especially his brother Allie, who committed suicide.<br /><br /> Fearing the repercussions of going home and telling his parents what has happened, Holden just keeps touring New York in his peculiar cap. He meets a girl he once liked, a teacher who is sympathetic to his plight, but Holden always ends up pushing others away. And when he does go home, his temptation to run away is changed irrevocably.<br /><br /> Remember the disaffected anti-hero of \\"Igby Goes Down,\\" who flunks school over and over, and runs away to hang out in New York? Cynical oddball Igby has Holden to thank for his existance. \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" catches teen dissatisfaction and dreams of freedom, making it seem almost painfully realistic.<br /><br /> Most classics don't include the anti-hero sputtering four-letter words on the first page. But Salinger's style for \\"Catcher\\" is an unusual one. Through Holden's eyes, it's a bitter and very straightforward style, peppered with wry observations. The biggest flaw would be the handling of Holden's own \\"phoniness,\\" since it's obvious he can be as phony as the people around him. It's subtle, but too subtle -- to less discerning readers, it seems like Holden is just a bitter hypocrite.<br /><br /> Holden Caulfield is a surprisingly nuanced character -- at first glance he just seems like an unusually obnoxious young boy who hates everything. But as the book unfolds, we see that he cares for genuine things, especially the innocence he no longer has. And he lacks the ability to connect with other people. None of the other characters really come to life... but they don't really need to. This is Holden's story.<br /><br />Salinger's cynical tour de force \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" is a bitter pill to swallow, but it's definitely worth it.

In \\"The Age of Innocence,\\" Wharton took readers on a trip through the stuffy upper crust of 1870s New York, wrapped up in a hopeless love affair.<br /><br />Newland Archer, of a wealthy old New York family, has become engaged to pretty, naive May. But as he tries to get their wedding date moved up, he becomes acquainted with May's exotic cousin, Countess Olenska, who has returned home after dumping her cheating count husband. At first, the two are friends, but then they become something more.<br /><br />After Newland marries May, the attraction to the mysterious Countess and her free, unconventional life becomes even stronger. He starts to rebel in little ways, but he's still mired in a 100% conventional marriage, job and life. Will he become an outcast and go away with the beautiful countess, or will he stick with May and a safe, dull life?<br /><br />There's nothing too scandalous about \\"Age of Innocence\\" in a time when J.Lo acquires and discards boyfriends and husbands like old pantyhose. Probably it wasn't in the 1920s, when the book was first published. But this isn't a book to read if you appreciate sexiness and steam -- instead it's a social satire, a bittersweet romance, and a look at what happens when human beings lose all spontaneity and passion.<br /><br />Wharton brings old New York to life in this book -- opulent, beautiful, cultured, yet empty and kind of boring. It is \\"where the real thing was never said or done or even thought,\\" so tied up in tradition that nobody there really lives. And even though the unattainable countess is beautiful and sweet, it becomes obvious after awhile that Newland is actually in love with the idea of breaking out of his conventional life.<br /><br />Wharton's writing is a bit like a giant rosebud -- it takes forever to fully open. So don't be discouraged by the endless conversations about flowers, ballrooms and gloves. Wharton put them in to illustrate her point about New York at that time, and all the stories about different families, scandals and customs are actually very important.<br /><br />Newland seems like a rather boring person, since he only has brief bursts of individuality. But he gets more interesting when he struggles between his conscience and his longing for freedom. May is (suitably) pallid and a bit dull, while the Countess is alluringly mysterious and unconsciously rebellious. The fact that she doesn't TRY to rebel makes her far more interesting than Newland.<br /><br />\\"Age of Innocence\\" considered a story about a man in love with an unattainable woman, but it's also about that man straining against a stagnant, hypocritical society.

But other forces are after the cauldron, including three peculiar witches who insist on trading something for the cauldron. What is worse, the company faces treachery from someone in their own camp...<br /><br />\\"The Castle of Llyr\\" ties up some loose ends from the first book, as Princess Eilonwy is sent to the isle of Mona to become a fine lady. But she has barely arrived when she is kidnapped by a minion of the evil enchantress Achren, her \\"aunt.\\" Taran sets out to save her, but must team up with the young man who wishes to marry Eilonwy -- even though Taran is rapidly falling in love with her.<br /><br />\\"Taran Wanderer\\" has Taran setting out to discover his past, since he feels he can't ask Eilonwy to marry him if he is lowborn. With only Gurgi at his side, he encounters evil wizards, malevolent bandits, and finally learns that his father just might be a shepherd... until a new revelation leads him to learn of his true worth.<br /><br />\\"The High King\\" wraps up the saga, with Taran returning home. But no sooner has he arrived than he learns that noble Prince Gwydion has been half-killed -- and the magical sword Dyrnwyn has been stolen by Arawn Deathlord. Now the heroes set out one and for all to attack Arawn's stronghold and get back the sword -- but how can they defeat a deathless army and a shapeshifting enemy?<br /><br />Finally, \\"The Foundling\\" fills in a few of the gaps with short stories that illustrate the backstory of the Prydain novels.

That pretty much sums up the Prydain Chronicles, which is one of the rare series that is meant for kids, but is as rich an experience for adults. Even better, if they know the origins of the old legends and myths.  <br />  <br />In a sense, the whole series is a coming-of-age story, where Taran learns wisdom, maturity, loss and love. Oh yeah, and that that Chinese curse about interesting times is quite correct. Princess Eilonwy and the bard-king Fflewddur Fflam add a bit of comic relief, but they are also strong characters in their own right, as is the fuzzy sidekick Gurgi, who goes from being an annoyance to a loyal and lovable friend.  <br />  <br />\\"The Chronicles of Prydain\\" are fantasy at its best, mingling myth and legend with a fast-paced plot and endearingly quirky characters. Definitely not something to miss.	2005-04-03

The novel follows the bumbling anarchist around the world, as he accidently spreads mayhem and bumps into many historic figures, and causes quite a few disasters.<br /><br />Dmitri Borja Korozec was born to a Brazilian contortionist and a Bosnian anarchist, and was perfectly normal except for the extra index finger on each hand. He is hailed as a sort of anarchic messiah to the Black Hand society... except that he's such a klutz that he fails every time. During an important assassination, his two trigger fingers get stuck in the gun, and he fails to assassinate Archduke Ferdinand.<br /><br />Dmitri leaves (with the gun still stuck), determined to continue the cause, and nearly gets seduced by the legendary Mata Hari. He goes through multiple countries and continents, getting involved with sultry women, trying to kill oppressers and always failing in spectacular ways. To top it off, he is being pursued both by a determined French policeman and a homicidal Indian dwarf.<br /><br />In outline, \\"Twelve Fingers\\" sounds like a perfectly ordinary historical novel -- wars, historical figures, world travel, et cetera. But the humor is in the details. Soares winks at anything that can't wink back, such as having the French cop being the grandson of Victor Hugo's Inspector Javert, or the repeated near-fatal escapes of Motilah the Thug dwarf, who keeps falling off trains.<br /><br />Soares doesn't let the book descend to basic comedy, however -- no icky jokes, no dumbing down. He includes cameo appearances by Mata Hari, Madame Curie, Picasso, and countless others, with blurry photographs accompanying the text. At the same time, he can deadpan lines that talk about the Italian Kama Sutra's chapter on men with two forefingers (nickname: Il Manusturbatore), and one of the most funniest love scenes I have ever read, complete with corny dialogue and too much alcohol.<br /><br />Dmitri is a basic Forrest Gump character -- he drifts through life, although the middle of the book could use a bit of a lift. His bumbling can only keep things going so long, but the ending takes a sharp upturn when Dmitri tries to track down his long-lost relative, with shocking (yet somehow unsurprising) results. Supporting characters never get much in the way of personality, but then again, it is a book about the inept anarchist.<br /><br />If Dmitri weren't such a goofball, it would be easy to imagine him bumbling through World War I-era Europe, leaving a train of mayhem behind him. As it is, Jose Soares' second novel is a rare comic treat.cohol. <br /> <br />Dmitri is a basic Forrest Gump character -- he drifts through life, although the middle of the book could use a bit of a lift.

Books	3	2	2	N	N	Some of her	Isabella Rossellini lays bare some of her life in \\"Some of Me,\\" an autobiography that reads like a prism -- it splits her life into many images, while never really forming a whole. It's an intriguing read, with plenty of interesting details about a unique life, but somehow Rossellini never quite bares her soul.<br /><br />Rosselini writes about her childhood in Italy, with movie icon Ingrid Bergman as a mother, and revolutionary filmmaker Roberto Rossellini as a father. She reluctantly entered acting -- and almost stopped forever when her first film was a flop -- and became a Lancôme cosmetics model, only to be fired for her age. She tells of her son's adoption, her battle with scoliosis, her failed marriage to Martin Scorsese, and the background of her vast mixed family.<br /><br />\\"Some of Me\\" is less like an autobiography than snapshots of Rossellini's life. It's non-linear, darting from adulthood to childhood to adolescence with no order. She doesn't explain much about her husbands and lovers, but explains plenty about the wet nurse who cared for her and her twin sister as babies.<br /><br />Rossellini gives the feeling of being at peace with the world -- she's gotten past her initial heartbreaks and problems. Some strong emotions -- grief at her mother's loss, anger at Lancôme's attitude towards her -- seep through. But Rossellini never really bares her deeper emotions or her soul. This book is like having a deep conversation with her: you will hear about her life, but won't be able to really get down and deep.<br /><br />Despite that, Rosselini has a bright style, full of melancholy and humor. She relates conversations with her now-dead parents, talks about pelting the paparazzi with rocks, and Audrey Hepburn's dirty fingernails. She lets readers see another side of Ingrid Bergman -- a loving neat-freak, who calmly tells her daughter that she's acquainted with the F-word.<br /><br />\\"Some of Me\\" is an apt title -- it gives us part of the picture, and leaves you feeling that parts of it are still hidden. Isabella Rossellini's book is engaging, but somehow feels unsatisfying.leaves you feeling that parts of it are still hidden.

The result is a gloriously witty social satire.<br /><br />It opens with two young women departing from a ladies' academy: dull, sweet Amelia (rich) and fiery sharp-witted Rebecca (poor). Becky Sharp is a relentless social climber, and her first effort to rise \\"above her station\\" is by trying to get Amelia's brother to marry her -- an effort thwarted by Amelia's fiancee. So instead she gets married to another family's second son, Rawdon Crawley.<br /><br />Unfortunately, both young couples quickly get disinherited and George is killed. But Becky is determined to live the good life she has worked and married for -- she obtains jewels and money from admiring gentlemen, disrupting her marriage. But a little thing like a tarnished reputation isn't enough to keep Becky down...<br /><br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is actually a lot more complex than that, with dozens of little subplots and complicated character relationships. Reading it a few times is necessary to really absorb all of it, since it is not just a look at the two women in the middle of the book, but at the upper (and sometimes lower) social strata of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />The main flaw of the book is perhaps that it sprawls too much -- there's always a lot of stuff going on, not to mention a huge cast of characters, and Thackeray sometimes drops the ball when it comes to the supporting characters and their little plots. It takes a lot of patience to absorb all of this. However... it's worth it.<br /><br />Like most nineteenth-century writers, Thackeray had a very dense, formal writing style -- but once you get used to it, his writing becomes insanely funny. Witticisms and quips litter the pages, even if you don't pick them all up at once. At first Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.<br /><br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her. Certainly life hasn't been fair for her. Next to Becky, a goody-goody character like Amelia is pretty boring, and even the unsubtle George can't measure up to Becky.<br /><br />To sum up \\"Vanity Fair\\": think a period soap opera with a heavy dose of social commentary. In other words, it doesn't get much better than this, Thackeray's masterpiece.ay seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.  <br /> <br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her.

Don't expect that here. \\"A Dome of Many Colored Glass\\" was her first collection, displaying all kinds of more traditional poetry -- sonnets, lyrical poems and children's ditties.<br /><br />Each type of poem has its own section. The first section is for lyrical poetry: songlike poems about Venetian glass, passionate prayer, birds and mythical golden apples. At times the rhyming gets a bit strained (\\"Orbed, and glittering, and pendent... Not one missing, still transcendent\\"), but her rich wording and varied styles cover up many of the flaws (\\"The air was of rose and gold/ Arabesqued with the song of birds/Who, swinging unseen under leaves,/Made music more eager than words.\\")<br /><br />After the lyrical poems come the sonnets. In many sonnets, her style seems restricted by the strict limits of the sonnet. However, her rich style does peek out in poems like \\"Monadnock in Early Spring,\\" as well as quite a few poems that ponder life's meaning. And gardens, too. Lowell then includes an ode to \\"The Boston Athenaeum,\\" and winds it up with some simplistic children's poems (\\"Sea Shell, Sea Shell,/ Sing me a song, O Please!/A song of ships, and sailor men,/And parrots, and tropical trees.\\")<br /><br />Amy Lowell's verse has a kind of quiet grace to it -- she focuses a lot on nature, and very personal feelings. While her poetry was never fully recognized during her short lifetime, it has gained more notice over time. This is partly due to Lowell's status as a woman poet, but more because of the quality of her verse.<br /><br />Her poetry is also deeply evocative. Like Wallace Stevens, Lowell used words to paint vivid portraits, including color and texture (\\"Sodden and spongy\\"). Often the images she conjures are a bit fantastical, which only adds to the appeal of her poetry (\\"The stars hang thick in the apple tree\\"; \\"The air was of rose and gold\\"). Her tone tends to be a bit formal, sprinkled with \\"thous\\" and \\"thees\\" every now and then.<br /><br />\\"Dome of Many-Colored Glass\\" does tend to be much more sentimental and conventional than Lowell's later work, which is its sole weakness -- it wasn't all that Lowell could have made it. Since it was her first book, Lowell hadn't yet graduated to the sharper, brighter \\"Sword Blades and Poppy Seed\\" which was published two years later. But taken on its own \\"Dome\\" is still quite beautiful.<br /><br />While \\"Dome of Many Colored Glass\\" was not the best of Lowell's poetry collections, it's still vibrant and quite lovely, if you get past some very strained rhymes and slightly soppy subject matterse and gold\\").

She falls in love with a businessman, David -- but he is divorced, and her strong Catholic beliefs don't allow her to marry a divorced man.<br /><br />\\"Awakening\\" was the novel that outraged the Victorian morals and sensibilities of the time, and tragically ended Chopin's writing career. Beautiful wife and mother Edna Pontellier has it all: a wealthy husband, cute kids, beautiful house... and yet she is dissatisfied. So Edna begins dabbling in painting and extramarital flirtations, with tragic results.<br /><br />\\"Bayou Folk\\" and a \\"Night in Acadie\\" are collections of short stories, centered in New Orleans and the areas of Louisiana nearby. Breakups, romance, death, marital dissatisfaction, freedom, racism and other still-touchy topics are explored in these stories, although bits of humor do intrude from time to time, such as the very short \\"Old Aunt Peggy,\\" about an ancient black woman who astonishes everyone by never dying. Added on to these are a number of uncollected stories.<br /><br />It takes a lot to make a book \\"scandalous\\" now, but in the late 1800s -- the height of the Victorian era -- it was painfully easy. There's nothing shocking in Chopin's writing by current standards, leaving her writing as a grave look at human nature. In that sense, Chopin's stories are truly timeless, and not just for women.<br /><br />Continuing themes do run through Chopin's short stories and novels, such as freedom, social boundaries, and the restrictions put on women at the time. One particularly stunning story is \\"Desiree's Baby,\\" about a young woman and her child who are cast out because the baby is not 100% white... except that her cruel husband has made a mistake.<br /><br />But it's not nearly as bleak as it sounds -- Chopin's writing is tempered by her dignified, distant 19th-century writing style, and the beauty of her descriptions. (\\"There was the hum of bees, and the musky odor of pinks filled the air.\\") Those descriptions can gloss over plot events as grim as suicide.<br /><br />\\"Complete Stories and Novels\\" is an excellent collection of Kate Chopin's work, and leaves one with regret that she didn't get to write even more during her brief lifetime.g story is \\"Desiree's Baby,\\" about a young woman and her child who are cast out because the baby is not 100% white... except that her cruel husband has made a mistake. <br /> <br />But it's not nearly as bleak as it sounds -- Chopin's writing is tempered by her dignified, distant 19th-century writing style, and the beauty of her descriptions.

In \\"The Age of Innocence,\\" Wharton took readers on a trip through the stuffy upper crust of 1870s New York, wrapped up in a hopeless love affair.<br /><br />Newland Archer, of a wealthy old New York family, has become engaged to pretty, naive May. But as he tries to get their wedding date moved up, he becomes acquainted with May's exotic cousin, Countess Olenska, who has returned home after dumping her cheating count husband. At first, the two are friends, but then they become something more.<br /><br />After Newland marries May, the attraction to the mysterious Countess and her free, unconventional life becomes even stronger. He starts to rebel in little ways, but he's still mired in a 100% conventional marriage, job and life. Will he become an outcast and go away with the beautiful countess, or will he stick with May and a safe, dull life?<br /><br />There's nothing too scandalous about \\"Age of Innocence\\" in a time when J.Lo acquires and discards boyfriends and husbands like old pantyhose. Probably it wasn't in the 1920s, when the book was first published. But this isn't a book to read if you appreciate sexiness and steam -- instead it's a social satire, a bittersweet romance, and a look at what happens when human beings lose all spontaneity and passion.<br /><br />Wharton brings old New York to life in this book -- opulent, beautiful, cultured, yet empty and kind of boring. It is \\"where the real thing was never said or done or even thought,\\" so tied up in tradition that nobody there really lives. And even though the unattainable countess is beautiful and sweet, it becomes obvious after awhile that Newland is actually in love with the idea of breaking out of his conventional life.<br /><br />Wharton's writing is a bit like a giant rosebud -- it takes forever to fully open. So don't be discouraged by the endless conversations about flowers, ballrooms and gloves. Wharton put them in to illustrate her point about New York at that time, and all the stories about different families, scandals and customs are actually very important.<br /><br />Newland seems like a rather boring person, since he only has brief bursts of individuality. But he gets more interesting when he struggles between his conscience and his longing for freedom. May is (suitably) pallid and a bit dull, while the Countess is alluringly mysterious and unconsciously rebellious. The fact that she doesn't TRY to rebel makes her far more interesting than Newland.<br /><br />\\"Age of Innocence\\" considered a story about a man in love with an unattainable woman, but it's also about that man straining against a stagnant, hypocritical society.

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big.

At least this one has some new information -- J. Randy Taraborrelli also explores the other Kennedy wives in \\"Jackie, Ethel, Joan: Women of Camelot.\\"  The problem is Taraborrelli's talent for making stuff up.<br /><br />Jackie was a confident debutante who impressed (or irritated) people with her charm and refined sensibiltiies. Ethel a religious, exuberant gal who fit in with the rough'n'tumble Kennedy family. And Joan was a fragile, confidence-free waif who was troubled by alcoholism and her perpetually philandering husband Ted.<br /><br />Taraborrelli explores their childhoods, early relationships, marriages and lives with their husbands, which peaked in the glory years of the so-called \\"Camelot.\\" Then everything went downhill: Jackie and Ethel's husbands were assassinated, Joan's was permanently disgraced, and the three women went through nightmares of publicity, family deaths, miscarriages, remarriages and alcoholism.<br /><br />The Jackie stuff in here is nothing new, nor does Taraborrelli have any new spins on it. In fact, she seems a bit dull beside the vibrant Ethel and tragic Joan, both of whom are revealed in all their tarnished glory. In fact, it's the information about those two ladies that keep this book from being a total loss.<br /><br />Unlike prior biographers have done, Taraborrelli seems interested in the many facets of Ethel and Joan's personalities: Ethel was both ruthless and compassionate, utterly loving and very rough. Rather than portraying the forceful woman as a harpy, as others have done, Taraborrelli focuses on her complexity. And Joan is shown as a sweet, almost ideal girl who succumbed to a family disease as she was humilated in front of the entire world.<br /><br />So long as he sticks to the facts, Taraborrelli is a capable biographer. Unfortunately, he launches into obviously fictional anecdotes and conversations, scuppering much of his credibility, and often fiddles with the facts to make the Kennedys seem like one big happy family, despite all the cheating and infighting.

It gives a taste of what is to come.<br /><br />Anna Wintour was born the daughter of high-ranking British parents, one a social do-gooder and the other a major newspaper editor. She followed in neither parent's footsteps -- from her early schooldays, it became obvious that Anna cared first and foremost about fashion, shortening her gym skirts and defying strict dress codes (which led to expulsion from high school).<br /><br />As a teen, she was a minor club goddess. Then with her father's credentials as a calling card, Anna started delving into the world of fashion writing, including brief stints at magazines like Harper's Bazaar, the ill-fated Viva, and Home and Gardens, which she singlehandedly destroyed. Finally \\"nuclear Wintour\\" got her dream job: editor-in-chief of Vogue magazine.<br /><br />Jerry Oppenheimer isn't exactly the ideal biographer, having written some truly awful biographies of Ethel Skakel Kennedy and Martha Stewart. However, he does a passable job with \\"Front Row,\\" by coolly and calmly exposing the many flaws of Vogue's editor-in-chief, including how she incited rebellion and destroyed at least one magazine with her celebrity-obsessed revamps.<br /><br />He also does an excellent job of deflating Wintour's imposing image, by revealing the times she was found sobbing, played \\"little girl,\\" or acted in a manner that could have gotten her sued. For example, we find out that she pettily fired people for not being young and attractive enough, and scuppered a bestselling author's essay because he wasn't good looking. Juicy juicy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Oppenheimer's writing is not up to the challenge. At best, his writing is dry and distant, with the odd embarrassing moment (such as a lame erection joke early in the book).

There is, however, one thing that all the poems have in common: Love.<br /><br />Love as romance. Love as idealism. Love as passion. Love lost. Love spurned. Love in decline. Love gained. Love being enjoyed. Love as a memory. Love as a wild thrill, a comforting embrace, an all-consuming joy. It's a sad irony that Teasdale herself never had a really successful love affair; most of what she wrote was idealized romance.<br /><br />In an era when poetry was being radically revamped, Teasdale generally stuck to Victorian poetry structures: simple rhyme schemes, rich phrasing, and a lot of nature descriptions, although in poems like \\"Summer Night, Riverside,\\" she tried freestyle forms. Surprisingly, her style doesn't seem cloying except in odd spots.<br /><br />There is one flaw: at times, Teasdale's lushly romantic sensibilities get overwhelming. It's a bit like reading the diary of a lovelorn Victorian teenager. However, taken in small doses, \\"Love Songs\\" reveals that Teasdale had a rare talent. \\"In the wild, soft summer darkness/How many and many a night we two together/Sat in the park and watched the Hudson/Wearing her lights like golden spangles/Glinting on black satin.\\"<br /><br />Lovers, romantics and fans of lush poetry will enjoy \\"Love Songs,\\" which brings together many of the best of Teasdale's (many) love poems. Pretty, charming and well-written.	2005-03-22

Heartwarming, funny, sad and highly educational, James Herriot's debut biography (he wrote five in all) give readers the whole messy, glorious picture of being a 1940s country veterinarian.<br /><br />The book opens (after a brief chapter taking place several months later) with James arriving in Yorkshire, to be the assistant to the eccentric but kindly Siegfried Farnon (yes, that is his name). He becomes accustomed to Siegfried, Siegfried's mischievous younger brother Tristan (yes, that is his name), and the gruff, kindly farmers who eke out a living in the Yorkshire Dales.<br /><br />Among the oddballs James encounters: Pampered pooches, savage pigs who chase Tristan around the farm, a nightmarishly strict secretary who drives Siegfried up the wall, James's brakeless car, cows running on three cylinders, a sadistic vet who makes James wear a rubber bodysuit, and an elderly, immensely wealthy widow who adopts a pig. And through this, James falls in love with the beautiful Helen Alderson and worms his way into the trust of the farmers.<br /><br />James Herriot (real name, James Wight) was truly a one-of-a-kind man. He let readers into his head throughout the book, where the cows kick him across the yard, farmers often treat him as an interloper or a nuisance, and his boss gives contradicting orders from one day to the next. But he never loses his drive or his love of animals. Okay, he hates some animals, but only as individuals.<br /><br />He even lets the readers see him at his worst, when he's humiliated by some recalcitrant livestock, and one horrible scene where he and his date show up drunk and mud-smeared in front of the girl he adores. (Not to mention when Tristan got him to use very feminine-smelling bath salts) But don't think that all of these stories are funny or romantic -- quite a few are aggravating or outright sad. James didn't soften the blows at all.<br /><br />There are a lot of details about surgery and animal care that will nauseate the squeamish, but at least you'll learn a lot of medical trivia. For example, what is a torsion? Herriot tells you early on, when he documents his nerve-wracking first case. But more than that, his love of animals is infectious -- it's easy to come out of this with a new appreciation for ordinary dogs, cows, cats, and so on.<br /><br />The people around James are just as fantastic: Siegfried, his weird but genial boss who can kick Tristan out of the house and forget about it overnight; Tristan, the mischievous anti-scholar who usually manages to keep out of trouble; and Helen, who seems a little too saintly at times (which isn't surprising, since James married her).<br /><br />It's sweet, sad, funny, romantic, dramatic, and full of the blood and sweat of vet work. \\"All Creatures Great And Small\\" is a truly unique and heartwarming biography.ames didn't soften the blows at all.  <br /> <br />There are a lot of details about surgery and animal care that will nauseate the squeamish, but at least you'll learn a lot of medical trivia.

In \\"A Dame To Kill For,\\" he ups the ante with new characters, a new lead, a different art style, and a continuation of the bloody, dark stories.<br /><br />\\"It's one of those hot nights, dry and windless. The kind that makes people do sweaty, secret things.\\" So opens \\"A Dame To Kill For,\\" as Dwight McCarthy snaps a secret hotel rendezvous (how's that for sweaty and secret?). But like everyone in Basin (\\"Sin\\") City, he has secrets and a past -- and that past returns to haunt him.<br /><br />His ex-girlfriend Ava reenters his life, announcing that she's scared of her ultrawealthy husband, Damien Lord, and seeking Dwight as a knight in tarnished armor. But Dwight doesn't know if he can trust her -- is Ava really in danger, or is she manipulating him as a pawn to get back at her husband? The truth just might destroy him...<br /><br />From the names (Ava Lord) to the grimy urban setting, \\"A Dame To Kill For\\" is pure noir. The storyline isn't terribly surprising overall -- any fan of noir movies will see what is going on -- but little parts of it are surprising and deeply interesting. Even moving. For example, one part of the story involves the wounded Dwight being cared for by the prostitutes of \\"Old Town,\\" a life-changing event for him.<br /><br />Miller has changed his style in this volume -- it's a bit more surreal, and a bit harder to take in. But the same stark, stripped-down use of black-and-white adds to the atmosphere of the comic. And Miller manages to perfectly capture the dry prose of noir, without crossing the line into parody (as most authors do). When Dwight says that he won't die because he still has too much to do, you believe him.<br /><br />Dwight himself is a complex character -- like Marv, he's a troubled man with turbulent emotions, and a sense of indebtedness. Interestingly, \\"A Dame To Kill For\\" actually takes place BEFORE \\"Hard Goodbye.\\" So Marv hasn't yet gotten into the bloodbath of the first volume, and serves as a sort of sidekick/partner to Dwight.<br /><br />While not the shocking bloodbath that \\"Hard Goodbye\\" was, \\"A Dame To Kill For\\" explores the noir nooks of Frank Miller's Sin City. Twisted, dark, and very enjoyable.E \\"Hard Goodbye.\\" So Marv hasn't yet gotten into the bloodbath of the first volume, and serves as a sort of sidekick/partner to Dwight.  <br /> <br />While not the shocking bloodbath that \\"Hard Goodbye\\" was, \\"A Dame To Kill For\\" explores the noir nooks of Frank Miller's Sin City.

And there is something extra in the weekends in \\"The Saturdays,\\" the first of Elizabeth Enright's charming books about the rambunctious Melendy family: money and adventure.<br /><br />Mona, Rush, Randy and Oliver Melendy are bored, one rainy Saturday. But then they come up with a unique idea: since their individual allowances aren't enough for them to do anything, they decide to pool them together, and every Saturday one of them will go on a solitary trip. Thus is formed I.S.A.A.C, their secret adventure club.<br /><br />Using the money turns out to be an adventure in itself: Mona has a shocking makeover, Randy's artistic explorations lead her to an unlikely friendship with an old lady, Oliver gets lost at the circus, and Rush finds a lovable stray on the way home from the \\"opry.\\" And when they decide to use the money as a group, the kids continue having offbeat problems...<br /><br />\\"The Saturdays\\" is basically a string of short stories -- aside from I.S.A.A.C., there is no real plot. But it's fun to get to know the Melendy family, and watch as they fall out of boats, deal with minor disasters, listen to tales of gypsy kidnappings, and undergo the growing pains of adolescence.<br /><br />Since the book was written in the early 1940s, there is a charming \\"old\\" air to the book, including a dramatic story near the end where the family almost \\"suffocaters\\" from coal gas. It was definitely in a safer time, if preteens were allowed to roam through New York. But the stories themselves could take place anytime, and perhaps anyplace -- falling out of boats, getting to know older and wiser people, and taking pity on animals.<br /><br />Enright did an astounding job making the family come alive, giving the Melendy kids individual strengths and flaws. They can do unwise things (like Mona's manicure), but the four of them are essentially goodhearted. Backing them up is their loving single dad, matronly housekeeper Cuffy, and scruffy workman Willy.<br /><br />\\"The Saturdays\\" is a charming look at kids having individual adventures, while learning things and stumbling in ways that make them more mature.

Tolstoy's story of lovers and family is interlaced with razor-sharp social commentary and odd moments that are almost transcendent. In other words, this is a masterpiece.<br /><br />When Stepan Oblonsky has an affair with the governess, his wife says that she's leaving him, and now the family is about to disintegrate. Stepan's sister Anna arrives to smooth over their marital problems, and consoles his wife Dolly until she agrees to stay. But on the train there, she met the outspoken Countess Vronsky, and the countess's dashing son, who is semi-engaged to Dolly's sister Kitty.<br /><br />Anna and Vronsky start to fall in love -- despite the fact that Anna has been married for ten years, to a wealthy husband she doesn't care about, and has a young son. Even so, Anna rejects her loveless marriage and becomes the center of scandal and public hypocrisy, and even becomes pregnany by Vronsky. As she prepares to jump ship and get a divorce, Anna becomes a victim of her own passions...<br /><br />That isn't the entire story, actually -- Tolstoy weaves in other plots, about disintegrating families, new marriages, and the melancholy Levin's constant search for God, truth, and goodness. Despite the grim storyline about adultery, and the social commentary, there's an almost transcendent quality to some of Tolstoy's writing. It's the most optimistic tragic book I've ever read.<br /><br />For some reason, Tolstoy called this his \\"first novel,\\" even though he had already written some before that. Perhaps it's because \\"Anna Karenina\\" tackles so many questions and themes, and does so without ever dropping the ball. No wonder it's so long and imposing -- Tolstoy covered a lot of ground in here.<br /><br />And while \\"Anna Karenina\\" was not the first book he wrote, it is probably the deepest and most moving. Tolstoy steeps the book in social commentary, and his personal philosophies. It's also one of those books that takes a very long time to move itself forward -- Tolstoy's writing is slow and ponderous, with a lot of serious discussion about religion and relationships. But his intense, slightly rough writing is worth it.<br /><br />In some tragic books, you get the feeling that the author really despises his characters, and doesn't really care what happens to them. Tolstoy never gives you that feeling -- no matter how annoying his characters are, they always have something interesting or endearing. No caricatures at all -- even Anna's irritating, arrogant brother is given some quirks to make him seem real.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the most moving character here is not Anna, but Konstantin Levin -- the tortured, passionate landowner is so earnest that it's difficult not to care about him. Apparently he was Tolstoy's alter ego, which explains his depth. But Anna and Vronsky are strong leads, a passionate pair who are both selfish and seductive, but never boring.<br /><br />A beautiful look at living right vs. living wrong, \\"Anna Karenina\\" is a truly magnificent book.

After practically reinventing the superhero comic, Frank Miller created a series that can definitely be called his opus -- gritty, dark, sexy and heady. Think of it as \\"The Big Sleep\\" meets \\"Kill Bill.\\"<br /><br />\\"The night is hot as hell. Everything sticks.\\" With those words, tough, scarred Marv encounters and beds a beautiful, alluring \\"goddess\\" named Goldie. No sooner have they made love than she is found dead beside him, and unsurprisingly the police believe that Marv is the killer. Case closed? Not really.<br /><br />Being blamed for the murder of the woman he loved, Marv devotes himself to finding who killed her and framed him. He rampages through the depths of Sin City, unearthing the twisted power structure that holds it up -- and in his homicidal quest, destroying his hidden enemies for the murder of Goldie... and in the process, dooming himself.<br /><br />The noir atmosphere starts from the first panel -- toughguyspeak, a silhouette and a beautiful woman. That dark, dirty feel sets the mood for the book, and in fact for the entire series. Imagine one of those old Humphrey Bogart noir movies, with the smoky atmosphere and black-and-white film... but darker, more violent, openly sexual, and often gruesome in tone.<br /><br />Miller's drawing style is all in black and white, and in \\"Hard Goodbye\\" the style is simple, but effective. He uses stark swashes of dark and light to illustrate the characters' faces and bodies, never overburdening the reader with too many unnecessary details. Although later volumes have more visual detail, Miller strips it down here to the bare bones, and it fits the spare narrative beautifully.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" itself is a seedy underbelly, full of crime, revenge and corruption; Marv isn't the guy who's going to clean it up, a la Dashiell Hammett, but the guy who will get revenge, no matter what the consequences are. The characters are just as dark: a corrupted Cardinal, psychopathic cannibal Kevin, and moderately crooked cops. Lots of death ensues.<br /><br />Frank Miller's \\"Sin City: The Hard Goodbye\\" is a hard book to read.

In her sixth volume, Teasdale had smoothed out some of the flaws from her verse, but the tone is still romantic, wistful and ethereal.<br /><br />The main theme of Teasdale's poetry is: love. The majority of her life's work centered on romance, even if it was restricted only to one adoring line per poem. She name-drops Deirdre, Helen, and especially Iseult as \\"those that love the most,\\" and focuses on unnamed lovers whom she worships completely.<br /><br />All is not the same, though -- the passion and intensity of her earlier poems have waned in favor of a quieter romantic sense, since Teasdale was increasingly disappointed in love. Quite a few of the poems are more introspective, musing on what would happen if she gave up poetry, or contemplations of nature and its beauty.<br /><br />One poem near the end of the book is poignantly ironic, where Teasdale announces that \\"I shall live to be old, who feared I should die young.\\" Since she committed suicide only seven years later, the final line (\\"... to envy sometimes the way of the early dead\\") seems sadder and more prophetic, as does her ponderings on a statue of a deceased nun. Not to mention that most legendary lovers she mentions met an untimely end.<br /><br />At the same time, Teasdale's poetry has become less like a lovestruck teenager's, and more like a mature, sorrowful woman. There's an autumnal quality to \\"Dark of the Moon,\\" with its references to falling leaves, empty beaches and \\"the great rain of moonlight pouring down.\\" She also relied less on rhyme and meter, and focused more on words.<br /><br />The idealistic romance and lyrical beauty that Teasdale did are alive in \\"Dark of the Moon,\\" though the passion had definitely waned. Still, the autumnal beauty of her poetry is all the more striking.	2005-03-16

In \\"The Age of Innocence,\\" Wharton took readers on a trip through the stuffy upper crust of 1870s New York, wrapped up in a hopeless love affair.<br /><br />Newland Archer, of a wealthy old New York family, has become engaged to pretty, naive May. But as he tries to get their wedding date moved up, he becomes acquainted with May's exotic cousin, Countess Olenska, who has returned home after dumping her cheating count husband. At first, the two are friends, but then they become something more.<br /><br />After Newland marries May, the attraction to the mysterious Countess and her free, unconventional life becomes even stronger. He starts to rebel in little ways, but he's still mired in a 100% conventional marriage, job and life. Will he become an outcast and go away with the beautiful countess, or will he stick with May and a safe, dull life?<br /><br />There's nothing too scandalous about \\"Age of Innocence\\" in a time when J.Lo acquires and discards boyfriends and husbands like old pantyhose. Probably it wasn't in the 1920s, when the book was first published. But this isn't a book to read if you appreciate sexiness and steam -- instead it's a social satire, a bittersweet romance, and a look at what happens when human beings lose all spontaneity and passion.<br /><br />Wharton brings old New York to life in this book -- opulent, beautiful, cultured, yet empty and kind of boring. It is \\"where the real thing was never said or done or even thought,\\" so tied up in tradition that nobody there really lives. And even though the unattainable countess is beautiful and sweet, it becomes obvious after awhile that Newland is actually in love with the idea of breaking out of his conventional life.<br /><br />Wharton's writing is a bit like a giant rosebud -- it takes forever to fully open. So don't be discouraged by the endless conversations about flowers, ballrooms and gloves. Wharton put them in to illustrate her point about New York at that time, and all the stories about different families, scandals and customs are actually very important.<br /><br />Newland seems like a rather boring person, since he only has brief bursts of individuality. But he gets more interesting when he struggles between his conscience and his longing for freedom. May is (suitably) pallid and a bit dull, while the Countess is alluringly mysterious and unconsciously rebellious. The fact that she doesn't TRY to rebel makes her far more interesting than Newland.<br /><br />\\"Age of Innocence\\" considered a story about a man in love with an unattainable woman, but it's also about that man straining against a stagnant, hypocritical society.

Unfortunately, Mainwaring couldn't equal Wharton's style, and the resulting book is a bit too rough to be excellent.<br /><br />The St. George family is wealthy and cultured, but since they are \\"new money,\\" haughty Virginia and childlike, passionate Nan are excluded from New York society. Nan's governess offers an alternative: the girls and three other snubbed debutantes will spend a season in England, where the newness of their money won't matter.

But when Virginia becomes engaged to a mild-mannered aristocrat, some people see the Americans as \\"stealing\\" eligible Englishmen. Meanwhile, Nan has fallen in love with an impoverished aristocrat, but she has some growing up to do first...<br /><br />Okay, nobody expected Wharton's manuscript to simply sit there, unfinished. It's not very satisfying, for one thing. But \\"The Buccaneers\\" doesn't quite work as a Wharton novel. Don't worry, it's a fun read with glimmers of Wharton's wit and societal observation. She just took the story across the pond to England.<br /><br />The problem is that Marion Mainwaring doesn't write like Wharton. She writes like someone TRYING to write like Wharton, and so her style and characterizations seem very exaggerated at times. Fortunately she only wrote about thirty percent of the book (based on Wharton's original synopsis) and so most of the book has Wharton's flavor.<br /><br />Not that the Wharton sections are quite perfect either -- since the book was unfinished, some parts of it have a \\"second draft\\" feel. And her sharp observations feel dulled here. But it accurately captures Wharton's preoccupation with Victorian propriety, manners, and the delicate social structure around old New York. Not to mention a dash of Henry James, with the stories of American innocents abroad.<br /><br />The concept of new vs. old money was a big deal in the 1870s, especially since it eventually overturned the old social order. Wharton populated her novel with wide-eyed (and sometimes loudmouthed) American girls, and impoverished young dukes and earls who are trying to keep the crumbling old estates going. Wharton also spiced up the cast with flamboyant mistresses, amnesiac noblemen, and a prim governess who happens to be the cousin of Dante Gabriel Rossetti.<br /><br />Edith Wharton left a promising book behind her when she died, and fortunately \\"The Buccaneers\\" was given passable treatment by Marion Mainwaring.

His follow-up to the cult hit \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" is the poignant, quirky, tender \\"Extremely Loud And Incredibly Close,\\" which takes readers back to the rubble of ground zero.<br /><br />Oskar Schell is a precocious preteen, who has been left depressed and traumatized. His father died in the September 11 attacks, leaving behind a mysterious key in an envelope with the word \\"Black\\" on it. So with the loyalty and passion that only a kid can muster, he begins to explore New York in search of that lock.<br /><br />As Oskar explores Manhatten, Foer also reaches throughout history to other horrific attacks that shattered people's lives, including his traumatized grandparents. Though the book is sprinkled with letters and stories from before Oskar's time, the boy's quest is the center of the book. And when he finally finds where the key belongs, he will find out a little something about human nature as well...<br /><br />Historically, only a short time has passed since 9/11, and in some ways \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\\" reopens the wounds. It reminds me of all the families who lost fathers, mothers and children. But Foer doesn't use cheap sentimentalism to draw in his readers, nor does he exploit the losses of September 11th families. It takes guts to write a book like this, and skill to do it well.<br /><br />In some ways, this book is much like Foer's first novel, but he deftly avoids retreading old ground -- the \\"quest\\" is vastly different, the young protagonist is very different, and the conflicts and loss are different, though no less hard-hitting. Foer also sticks to that wonderfully oddballish prose, which gives a gloss of lightness to a deep plot.<br /><br />After all, that is what made his first book so appealing -- there are parts of \\"Extremely\\" that are laugh-out-loud funny, and quirky characters worthy of a Wes Anderson movie. For example, one scene has Oskar sending a letter to Stephen Hawking, asking, \\"Can I please be your prot&eacute;g&eacute;?\\"<br /><br />Child genius Oskar will probably make you want to either smack or hug him -- I tended more towards hugs. That's because Foer doesn't make Oskar seem like a tiny adult -- he's brilliant, but his mind still has the whimsy of a child's mind. His little \\"inventions\\" are just the sort of thing you'd expect an imaginative nine-year-old to create, and his quest is a realistic one, considering the tragedy he had suffered.<br /><br />\\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\\" proves that Jonathan Safran Foer was no one-hit wonder.

In \\"The Age of Innocence,\\" Wharton took readers on a trip through the stuffy upper crust of 1870s New York, wrapped up in a hopeless love affair.<br /><br />Newland Archer, of a wealthy old New York family, has become engaged to pretty, naive May. But as he tries to get their wedding date moved up, he becomes acquainted with May's exotic cousin, Countess Olenska, who has returned home after dumping her cheating count husband. At first, the two are friends, but then they become something more.<br /><br />After Newland marries May, the attraction to the mysterious Countess and her free, unconventional life becomes even stronger. He starts to rebel in little ways, but he's still mired in a 100% conventional marriage, job and life. Will he become an outcast and go away with the beautiful countess, or will he stick with May and a safe, dull life?<br /><br />There's nothing too scandalous about \\"Age of Innocence\\" in a time when J.Lo acquires and discards boyfriends and husbands like old pantyhose. Probably it wasn't in the 1920s, when the book was first published. But this isn't a book to read if you appreciate sexiness and steam -- instead it's a social satire, a bittersweet romance, and a look at what happens when human beings lose all spontaneity and passion.<br /><br />Wharton brings old New York to life in this book -- opulent, beautiful, cultured, yet empty and kind of boring. It is \\"where the real thing was never said or done or even thought,\\" so tied up in tradition that nobody there really lives. And even though the unattainable countess is beautiful and sweet, it becomes obvious after awhile that Newland is actually in love with the idea of breaking out of his conventional life.<br /><br />Wharton's writing is a bit like a giant rosebud -- it takes forever to fully open. So don't be discouraged by the endless conversations about flowers, ballrooms and gloves. Wharton put them in to illustrate her point about New York at that time, and all the stories about different families, scandals and customs are actually very important.<br /><br />Newland seems like a rather boring person, since he only has brief bursts of individuality. But he gets more interesting when he struggles between his conscience and his longing for freedom. May is (suitably) pallid and a bit dull, while the Countess is alluringly mysterious and unconsciously rebellious. The fact that she doesn't TRY to rebel makes her far more interesting than Newland.<br /><br />\\"Age of Innocence\\" considered a story about a man in love with an unattainable woman, but it's also about that man straining against a stagnant, hypocritical society.

Many years later, a rescue squad sets out to bring back the young prince -- but can this rude, gluttonous, nasty boy be their long-lost prince? Or do they have the wrong boy?<br /><br />\\"The Island of the Aunts\\" gives a new spin to \\"hidden\\" magical creature -- old ladies Etta, Coral and Myrtle live on an otherwise deserted island, caring for a group of magical creatures, including a selkie, mermaids, and a kraken. But the aunts are getting old, and so they decide that they'll get some children to help them care for the magical creatures. The problem is, they have to kidnap them...<br /><br />In \\"Which Witch,\\" wizard Arriman the Awful has to get married so he can produce a wizardly heir. The problem is, he has to marry a witch -- and the thought of marrying a repulsive crone makes his skin crawl. A contest is held to see who will be Arriman's wife, and poor white witch Belladonna thinks that her sweetness-and-light spells don't stand a chance. Can she manage something really nasty for the contest?<br /><br />Sure, \\"Harry Potter\\" may be more popular, but Ibbotson's ogres, wizards, mermaids and plucky preteen boys were there first. These three books are probably among Ibbotson's best, although admittedly I have not read every single novel she's written.<br /><br />Ibbotson has a knack for comedy and whimsy, sometimes with a slightly grotesque twist (such as a legendary skinless creature in \\"Platform\\" -- all organs on display). But the crisp prose keeps it steady and grounded, as if magical beasties and disgruntled wizards were all perfectly normal.

Now they live alone, taunted by claims of witchcraft and murder by the nearby villagers. Merricat stews angrily, fantasizing about murder, while Constance seems to drift off in her own world.<br /><br />But their cousin Charles soon comes for a visit, and the jealous Merricat fears that Constance will be lured away by him. Her anger grows even darker and more overwhelming, and the danger of the suspicious villagers grows as well. And soon the truth about the arsenic in the sugar bowl comes to light...<br /><br />\\"We Have Always Lived In the Castle\\" explores what Shirley Jackson did best: the evils of the human mind. Not ghoulies, ghosties, vampires and things that go bump in the night. In this case, it's a creepy look at what happens when someone is unable to live in the world we inhabit.<br /><br />And it is quite creepy, with psychotic woman-child Merricat, and the trapped domestic Constance trying to cover for her little sister. The problem is that the whole arsenic murder doesn't seem to make sense -- with a bit more explanation, Jackson's subplot might have been plausible, but the characters never fully explain their motives.<br /><br />That lack of understanding undermines the two sisters. Oddly enough, the mentally unbalanced Merricat is the more understandable of the two sisters, mostly because she's the narrator. Constance remains an enigma, but you get the feeling that she simply craves a \\"normal life,\\" while trying to maintain the warped reality that Merricat has.<br /><br />Creepy Gothic horror and psychological thrills lie at the heart of \\"We Have Always Lived In The Castle,\\" but some plot flaws leave the novel feeling rough and unfinished.ave Always Lived In The Castle,\\" but some plot flaws leave the novel feeling rough and unfinished.	2005-03-09

Tolstoy's story of lovers and family is interlaced with razor-sharp social commentary and odd moments that are almost transcendent. In other words, this is a masterpiece.<br /><br />When Stepan Oblonsky has an affair with the governess, his wife says that she's leaving him, and now the family is about to disintegrate. Stepan's sister Anna arrives to smooth over their marital problems, and consoles his wife Dolly until she agrees to stay. But on the train there, she met the outspoken Countess Vronsky, and the countess's dashing son, who is semi-engaged to Dolly's sister Kitty.<br /><br />Anna and Vronsky start to fall in love -- despite the fact that Anna has been married for ten years, to a wealthy husband she doesn't care about, and has a young son. Even so, Anna rejects her loveless marriage and becomes the center of scandal and public hypocrisy, and even becomes pregnany by Vronsky. As she prepares to jump ship and get a divorce, Anna becomes a victim of her own passions...<br /><br />That isn't the entire story, actually -- Tolstoy weaves in other plots, about disintegrating families, new marriages, and the melancholy Levin's constant search for God, truth, and goodness. Despite the grim storyline about adultery, and the social commentary, there's an almost transcendent quality to some of Tolstoy's writing. It's the most optimistic tragic book I've ever read.<br /><br />For some reason, Tolstoy called this his \\"first novel,\\" even though he had already written some before that. Perhaps it's because \\"Anna Karenina\\" tackles so many questions and themes, and does so without ever dropping the ball. No wonder it's so long and imposing -- Tolstoy covered a lot of ground in here.<br /><br />And while \\"Anna Karenina\\" was not the first book he wrote, it is probably the deepest and most moving. Tolstoy steeps the book in social commentary, and his personal philosophies. It's also one of those books that takes a very long time to move itself forward -- Tolstoy's writing is slow and ponderous, with a lot of serious discussion about religion and relationships. But his intense, slightly rough writing is worth it.<br /><br />In some tragic books, you get the feeling that the author really despises his characters, and doesn't really care what happens to them. Tolstoy never gives you that feeling -- no matter how annoying his characters are, they always have something interesting or endearing. No caricatures at all -- even Anna's irritating, arrogant brother is given some quirks to make him seem real.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the most moving character here is not Anna, but Konstantin Levin -- the tortured, passionate landowner is so earnest that it's difficult not to care about him. Apparently he was Tolstoy's alter ego, which explains his depth. But Anna and Vronsky are strong leads, a passionate pair who are both selfish and seductive, but never boring.<br /><br />A beautiful look at living right vs. living wrong, \\"Anna Karenina\\" is a truly magnificent book.

It's embarrassing just to read.<br /><br />Taylor's childhood is treated with more or less indifference -- it's her teen years that begin to spark Amburn's interest. She studies the relationships she had with men from adolescence onward, particularly the asexual ones that she had with attractive heterosexual men, and the \\"a-loving\\" ones that she had with gay ones.<br /><br />That tendency, Amburn argues, took her through several unhappy marriages and plenty of explosive relationships, including ones that shattered assorted marriages. In the midst of all this, she also weathered health crises and worldwide censure with plenty of guts, becoming a sort of grande dame of the filmmaking business.<br /><br />Love her or hate her, Elizabeth Taylor is a larger-than-life figure, and there's plenty in her life to fuel a biography. Many biographers have managed to describe her lifetime with grace and taste, despite her sailor's mouth and tumultuous love life. She doesn't have to be portrayed as squeaky clean, just human.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amburn usually chooses to focus on the more grotesque aspects of Taylor's life. She delves into the sex lives (complete with sometimes disgusting details) of everyone who had been involved with Taylor, especially the gay men. Which, by the way, make up a lot of the book -- Amburn attaches the \\"gay\\" tag to quite a few men, the only way that she manages to pay any attention to them. That particular preoccupation hangs over the entire book like a stormcloud. Don't the heterosexual men in Taylor's life deserve equal scrutiny?<br /><br />Taste is nowhere to be found here -- Amburn has an almost obsessive interest in Taylor's breasts, and the sexual and penile details of her husbands, lovers and pals. What these things add to the history, she doesn't bother to say. The sledgehammer writing is that of a tabloid reporter, but without the restraints of an editor, Amburn appears to have gone wild.<br /><br />Taylor herself comes across as a blowsy diva, without a single redeeming characteristic except her acting skills. Amburn, don't bother writing a biography if you don't have any liking or respect for your subject. Not that she's alone; her husbands are all portrayed as walking disasters of alcoholism, gambling and physical abuse, and her kids are nonentities.

The plot twists sometimes become too soap-operaish, but at least \\"Jalna\\" is fun.<br /><br />The mansion of Jalna has an array of uncles, brothers, and a sister, all presided over by semi-senile Grandmother. And one day, sharp-tongued Piers shocks all of his relatives -- he marries pretty, delicate Pheasant, who is the illegitimate daughter of his sister Meg's ex-lover (got that?), much to the horror of his family and bratty Meg. What's more, budding poet Eden falls in love with a pretty fan from Brooklyn, Alayne, and marries her.<br /><br />Neither marriage is immediately accepted, although Grandmother somewhat approves of Alayne because she thinks the girl has money. But things become more complicated when Alayne falls in love with her earthy brother-in-law Renny, and Pheasant falls in love with sensitive Eden. When Eden and Pheasant are overheard together, the family is thrown into turmoil...<br /><br />Mazo de la Roche wrote many books about the Whiteoak family, but this novel lays the groundwork, with all the characters that the sequels and prequels branch out from. Taken alone, it's an entertaining dramatic read, although the semi-incestuous attractions and affairs start to get away from de la Roche as the book continues.<br /><br />de la Roche had a robust writing style, with plenty of fights, sometimes violence, mild comedy and repressed sexual tension.

It's a flawed dark gem; there's a work of genius buried somewhere in the clumsiness.<br /><br />Richard Papen somehow manages to get transferred from a culturally dead backwater in California, to the elite liberal arts college of Hampden in Vermont. Once there, he manages to get accepted into the tiny class of elite students who are studying Greek -- the charming gay Francis, obnoxious sponger Bunny, frightening super-intellect Henry and the beautiful, too-close twins Charles and Camilla.<br /><br />At first, he tries to hide his impoverished origins and fit in with the beautiful, wealthy students who happily bounce off to Italy for vacation. But he soon learns that there is a dark edge to their love of ancient Greece -- the bacchanal, a barbaric ritual that ended in a man's death. And to keep the secret of that death, Richard will help his new friends kill again -- only this time, it's one of them who will die.<br /><br />\\"The Secret History\\" is definitely a first novel. Donna Tartt writes with a sure hand and confidence, name-dropping just about every Greek and Roman scholar you can think of (also Milton and Donne for good measure). She has a way of writing that sweeps along in a tangle of beautiful words, glossing over the flaws those words have created, without losing the aura of Greek tragedy. It's less about the death of Bunny than it is about what his death does to the others. In short, this book is gorgeous. But it's far from perfect.<br /><br />Her descriptions are almost peerless, very beautiful and haunted (mostly in keeping with the idea that \\"beauty is terror\\"). There are plenty of natural descriptions, from the snow in Richard's apartment to the stream Camilla plays in. Tartt certainly has the \\"you are there\\" factor in her ornate, detailed writing. The story is also impeccably paced, starting off slow and building up to the inevitable event.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Tartt's details leave something to be desired. Her descriptions of the group are almost like a parody of elite college students. Why is Bunny talking about \\"old top,\\" \\"old man,\\" \\"chum\\" and so forth? Why does Californian Richard suddenly turn into a 19th-century preppie? Why is Francis wearing a pince-nez in the 1980s? And she goes way over the top in making Bunny \\"dislikable\\" -- he's a moocher, obnoxious, has a grating voice and is prejudiced against Catholics, Italians, gays, et cetera. It's as if his death has to be justified in Tartt's eyes by making him a huge pain in the butt.<br /><br />Another flaw crops up in characterization. The little circle of students is shown as being coolly intelligent, cultured, and charming despite their fatal flaws. All other students -- all the \\"ordinary\\" people -- are coke-snorting, gauche, loud and stupid. Couldn't be some elitism there, could there? Richard is, unfortunately, a terrible lead character; he's not too bright, clueless, dull and self-pitying. His adoration of the rich, pretty and hedonistic never wears off. With the exception of the unfortunate Bunny, the others are intriguing rather than well-rounded, with their wildly varying personalities and hidden secrets.<br /><br />Despite the elite literary edge, the core of \\"Secret History\\" is unsound.

Most coffee table books are just giant books that sit and collect dust on people's coffee tables.<br /><br />But this? It's a book, and it's about coffee tables. Get it? Yeah, yeah. So did \\"Seinfeld's\\" Kramer. And without the kooky sidekick to give it an entertaining twist, the \\"Coffee Table Book\\" really comes across as rather boring, except to aficionados of interior design.<br /><br />The photography is quite pretty, and most of the coffee tables are interesting -- they range from futuristic to icky (a topless, leather-clad woman on all fours makes up the base of one -- shades of \\"Spinal Tap\\") to 100% ordinary. Some are flowing structures of metal, wood and glass, while others are garish blobs of plastic.<br /><br />The problem is, you can only look at pictures of coffee tables for so long. And it doesn't help that the little text blurbs accompanying each picture really don't illuminate much. A tiny shred of history, and maybe a quote are included. As a result, it feels like a hardcover furniture catalog, with only one item of furniture included.<br /><br />It's a cute idea, but the \\"Coffee Table Book\\" is too long and bland to be of any actual interest. It would be best on -- you guessed it -- the coffee table, so guests can chuckle at the title.	2005-03-05

Cherry initially thinks that she is the Rain Demon, but it turns out that because of her father's promise years ago, she's merely cursed. She now needs a loyal pal, and Ataru is all too willing to take the job. Later, the gang encounters a melancholy (and beautiful) ghost, and try to help her find peace... except she may not be as pitifully innocent as she looks! And when a hurricane hits the Morobishi household, Lum's antigravity device causes walls of water -- on the ceiling.<br /><br />More hijinks ensue when Lum accidently spreads an alien flu through the school, the gang takes the \\"Pool Freak\\" to the seaside, Sakura goes to a graveyard to meet her fiancee's (dead) father, and a cursed watermelon menaces a town. Finally, Lum and Ataru have to deal with an idiotic vampire and his smart-alecky bat, who are trying their very best to suck Lum's blood.<br /><br />Takahashi created the ultimate alien sitcom with the \\"Urusei Yatsura\\" series, and the fun only flags in one or two places. (The story about Tama the ghost lags somewhat). By this time, Takahashi had settled well into her style, and what is more, she was doing longer and more involved stories about demons, deranged monks, and oddball aliens.<br /><br />Things have changed a little by this point in the series -- Lum is less likely to zap Ataru, and while Ataru still chases girls, he has settled into a comfy routine with Lum. And Takahashi's art style had also changed a little: sultry priestess Sakura and her boyfriend Tsubame look eerily like the leads of \\"Maison Ikkoku.\\" Alien tot Ten still looks like a floating head with a teeny little body, though.<br /><br />Takahashi piles on the comedy, whether it's precocious Ten making goofy faces, a Walkman-wearing Cherry surfing, or Ataru making out with a bat while Lum laughs hysterically in the trees. And with Lum and Ataru now familiar to readers, the supporting characters provide plenty of laughs, such as the bewigged Cherry, Ataru's long-suffering parents, and the completely stupid Count Dracula.<br /><br />The seventh volume of \\"Urusei Yatsura\\" is an entertaining set of sci-comedy tales.

The result is a gloriously witty social satire.<br /><br />It opens with two young women departing from a ladies' academy: dull, sweet Amelia (rich) and fiery sharp-witted Rebecca (poor). Becky Sharp is a relentless social climber, and her first effort to rise \\"above her station\\" is by trying to get Amelia's brother to marry her -- an effort thwarted by Amelia's fiancee. So instead she gets married to another family's second son, Rawdon Crawley.<br /><br />Unfortunately, both young couples quickly get disinherited and George is killed. But Becky is determined to live the good life she has worked and married for -- she obtains jewels and money from admiring gentlemen, disrupting her marriage. But a little thing like a tarnished reputation isn't enough to keep Becky down...<br /><br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is actually a lot more complex than that, with dozens of little subplots and complicated character relationships. Reading it a few times is necessary to really absorb all of it, since it is not just a look at the two women in the middle of the book, but at the upper (and sometimes lower) social strata of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />The main flaw of the book is perhaps that it sprawls too much -- there's always a lot of stuff going on, not to mention a huge cast of characters, and Thackeray sometimes drops the ball when it comes to the supporting characters and their little plots. It takes a lot of patience to absorb all of this. However... it's worth it.<br /><br />Like most nineteenth-century writers, Thackeray had a very dense, formal writing style -- but once you get used to it, his writing becomes insanely funny. Witticisms and quips litter the pages, even if you don't pick them all up at once. At first Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.<br /><br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her. Certainly life hasn't been fair for her. Next to Becky, a goody-goody character like Amelia is pretty boring, and even the unsubtle George can't measure up to Becky.<br /><br />To sum up \\"Vanity Fair\\": think a period soap opera with a heavy dose of social commentary. In other words, it doesn't get much better than this, Thackeray's masterpiece..

But the story of Jo March didn't stop when she went to Plumfields. This collection includes not just \\"Little Women,\\" but also its two sequels.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" introduces us to the four March sisters: pretty Meg, shy Beth, aspiring artist Amy, and tomboyish Jo. In the middle of the Civil War, the girls mature and explore the world, with the help of their mischievous male neighbor Laurie. But with their new freedoms and loves come sacrifices and heartbreak as well...<br /><br />At the end of the first book, \\"Mother Bhaer\\" adopted a small army of preteen boys in addition to her own sons. \\"Little Men\\" chronicles the growing pains of her boys -- some of them have been neglected, some are wild, some are nieces and \\"nevvies\\" of Jo's, and some just need the delightful chaos of a loving home.<br /><br />\\"Jo's Boys\\" wraps up the trilogy in a bittersweet manner. Jo's boys (and girls) have grown up and are starting to stretch their wings away from home, and are even starting to fall in love. Some of the boys have run-ins with the law, some have trouble pursuing the girls of their dreams, and one will risk his very soul -- and his love -- for something he believes in.<br /><br />With a much-beloved classic like \\"Little Women,\\" it's pretty much a given that the sequels won't stack up. But \\"Little Men\\" and \\"Jo's Boys\\" are still a good mixture of humor, poignancy and \\"lovering.\\" And of course, the original \\"Little Women\\" is one of the best coming-of-age novels of all time, as well as the best book that Alcott ever wrote.<br /><br /> Alcott had a talent for writing realistic family stories and sweet romances, without letting them get dull.

Her cousin Fan Shaw (also about fourteen) is already dressed like a young woman, and hangs out with a gang of shallow, trendy girls. Polly befriends old ladies, sings Scottish airs, and reads books on history. Can she fit in? What's more... does she really want to?<br /><br />Fast forward about five or six years: The Shaw family learns that Polly is returning to the city, intending to give music lessons to help support her brother. Time hasn't really changed Polly -- she's still sweet-natured, moral and pleasant to everyone. But the Shaw family is in serious financial trouble -- and Polly will help out the only way she knows how.<br /><br />In the late 1800s, \\"Girl\\" was written in two separate halves, which might explain why the second half is so much better than the first. The first isn't bad, but it suffers from a sort of prissiness. Virtually every story centers on Polly's moral struggles, with no break. Her story is far more engaging when she learns confidence and strength, not when she's wavering about peer pressure.<br /><br />As in \\"Little Women,\\" Alcott's writing is still pretty readable for modern readers, although most people will not know what a \\"pannier\\" is. She also writes a good understated love story, in Polly's gradual interest in her cousin Tom. You'll know that these two really need to get together, but it's going to take them awhile. So sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Polly may put you off at first with her air of vague goody-two-shoes-ness, but she improves over the course of the book. Somewhat more realistic are the spoiled little brat Maud, the grumpy Tom, and the pretty but air-headed Fan. Grandmother isn't quite so engaging; she seems like an idealized older person who exists just to dispense wisdom. How about some personal quirks for the old lady?<br /><br />Louisa May Alcott managed to wrap a lesson about peer pressure around a real story.

After winning chick-lit hearts with the poignant \\"P.S. I Love You,\\" Ahern stumbles with \\"Rosie Dunne.\\" She tries to make it quirky and serious, but only makes the email/IM format seem horribly gimmicky.<br /><br />Alex and Rosie were friends ever since they were little kids, bickering and making up and causing trouble in school. But one day Alex learns that his dad has gotten a boring job in Boston, and the whole family is moving away from Ireland. The friends plan to get to nearby colleges, Alex at Boston U and Rosie at Harvard.<br /><br />Then a high school dance shatters their dream: Rosie gets pregnant by a one-time date, and becomes a mother at only eighteen. Now Alex has a sexy fiancee and a thriving life in the U.S., while Rosie is stuck in Dublin as a single mom. Will their hidden love win out, or will they find separate lives -- but not happiness?<br /><br />With a debut as loved as \\"P.S. I Love You,\\" it would be easy to be too tough on \\"Rosie Dunne.\\" But taken only on its own, it's still pretty bad. While other authors like Meg Cabot have managed to make books like this book, Ahern's book feels like she dashed it off in a weekend to make a publisher's deadline. There's no soul.<br /><br />The big problem is the fact that the book is entirely make of letters, emails and instant messages. Okay, it's cute, but it's essentially a gimmick. A gimmick, moreover, that means you don't have to write character developments, introductions, settings, description or any of that other tough stuff. And without standout characters, those messages feel hollow and empty. What's more, sections of the book zip by too fast -- major life events happen in less than a page. You'd think best friends would communicate more often.<br /><br />Though the dust jacket proclaims that they are perfect for each other, Rosie and Alex don't come across as such. They don't seem to have much in common, and never experience any realistic emotion stronger than irritation. Rosie's pregnancy, for example, would seem like a major source of angst and strain -- but all she does is mope for a few pages, then complain that she feels fat.<br /><br />Reading \\"Rosie Dunne\\" is like reading random messages from a stranger's email -- in theory they might be exciting, but you don't know enough about the person to care much.n irritation.

(Red Dress Ink)	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Feathers and finery	Weddings are a natural topic for chick-lit -- they involve love, chaos, annoying relatives, career fluctuation and loyal galpals. All the ingredients of successful chick-lit. So this spinoff of \\"See Jane Date,\\" starring the lovable pal, sits solidly on safe territory as it tells the story of a woman dealing with her past.<br /><br />Eloise Manfred thinks she's hit the jackpot: she's engaged but poor, and her malevolent editor Astrid has just offered to foot the bill, if Eloise takes part in a special magazine article. But Eloise rapidly discovers that she is \\"Modern Bride,\\" while oddball Philippa is the \\"Classic Bride.\\" Meaning that Philippa gets every-little-girl's-dream wedding, and Eloise gets rubber Star Trek bridesmard dresses and a yellow feathered gown.<br /><br />Eloise is rapidly finding out that it may not be worth it, if she has to have a hideous wedding and hire fake family. To make things worse, a reunion with her little brother Emmett reveals that his girlfriend is pregnant -- and Emmett is seriously considering going AWOL, as their father did long ago. With her engagement in doubt and her wedding going down the tubes, Eloise sets out to find her father, and straighten out her issues.<br /><br />The only problem is that the novel seems to have a bit of an identity crisis -- it flips rapidly between being a tense, angsty story about a woman sorting out her issues, and a goofy tale about yellow feathered wedding dresses and toxic future in-laws. Each one would be an excellent book, but together they feel rather odd.<br /><br />While Melissa Senate relies on tried-and-true wedding disasters (evil mother-in-law, annoying sister-in-law, commitmentphobia), she also has fun with the \\"Modern Bride\\" trappings. It's the sort of thing most women -- aside from Philippa types -- have nightmares about. Most frightening of all is the fact that those trappings are probably real -- square wedding rings, Star Trek gowns and more.<br /><br />Senate is particularly to be commended for doing such a sensitive, enlightened look at Eloise's brother and father, and the way they have shaped her personality. Eloise gets plenty of depth here that wasn't even hinted at in \\"See Jane Date.\\" And while Emmett's fiancee is a bit annoying, the will-he-or-won't-he-commit tale rings very true.<br /><br />Nothing too startling happens in \\"Whose Wedding Is It Anyway?\\", but it's an interesting mix of family angst and pre-wedding disasters.

Many years later, a rescue squad sets out to bring back the young prince -- but can this rude, gluttonous, nasty boy be their long-lost prince? Or do they have the wrong boy?<br /><br />\\"The Island of the Aunts\\" gives a new spin to \\"hidden\\" magical creature -- old ladies Etta, Coral and Myrtle live on an otherwise deserted island, caring for a group of magical creatures, including a selkie, mermaids, and a kraken. But the aunts are getting old, and so they decide that they'll get some children to help them care for the magical creatures. The problem is, they have to kidnap them...<br /><br />In \\"Which Witch,\\" wizard Arriman the Awful has to get married so he can produce a wizardly heir. The problem is, he has to marry a witch -- and the thought of marrying a repulsive crone makes his skin crawl. A contest is held to see who will be Arriman's wife, and poor white witch Belladonna thinks that her sweetness-and-light spells don't stand a chance. Can she manage something really nasty for the contest?<br /><br />Sure, \\"Harry Potter\\" may be more popular, but Ibbotson's ogres, wizards, mermaids and plucky preteen boys were there first. These three books are probably among Ibbotson's best, although admittedly I have not read every single novel she's written.<br /><br />Ibbotson has a knack for comedy and whimsy, sometimes with a slightly grotesque twist (such as a legendary skinless creature in \\"Platform\\" -- all organs on display).

Italo Calvino apparently thought so -- his magical-realist fantasy \\"Cosmicomics\\" is one of the two best novels he ever wrote. Enchanting, surreal and whimsical, this is a look at the history of the cosmos that you will never find in any astronomy books.<br /><br />Qfwfq is an ancient being -- he was a child playing with his family when the matterless void began to produce.... \\"things.\\" Along with others of his kind, he has lived an immeasurably long lifetime, watching the Big Bang itself -- uniquely described in this case -- and the galaxy form, the earth cool and start to produce life.<br /><br />And so Qfwfq goes through the ages, with all the rivalries, crushes, lost loves and exciting discoveries that a person experiences in their life (even though his life is uncounted millions long). And behind each of his experiences is a great cosmic event -- the Big Bang itself is caused by a loving aunt-like friend, an adolescent crush follows the moon away from the Earth, a rivalry forms between himself and the nasty Kwgwk, and his first love is doomed by his love of color on Earth's forming surface.<br /><br />It takes a truly unique imagination to create something like this -- Calvino takes forming planets, whirling galaxies and ultraviolet rays, and gives them a whimsical spin. One moment he is taking your breath away with his descriptions of the Milky Way, the next he's getting smiles for the image of Qfwfq and his pals playing marbles with hydrogen atoms.<br /><br />It's that mixture of grandeur and innocent whimsy that makes \\"Cosmicomics\\" so good. Not to mention, of course, Calvino's talent for poetic prose. In less than a paragraph, he can convey the vastness of the universe; in less than a chapter, he can describe the beauty of primeval Earth. In detail. Now that's really something.<br /><br />Most striking of all may be the story of a motherly she-particle, whose love for him and the other beings caused \\"the concept of space and, properly speaking, space itself, and time, and universal gravitation, and the gravitation universe, making possible billions and billions of suns, and of planets, and fields of wheat.\\" It takes a few minutes to sink in that Calvino wrote that the universe was first sparked by love.<br /><br />Calvino never really explains what Qfwfq is -- I suppose he's an atom or something of the sort, although how atoms have \\"long silvery arms\\" or build bamboo bridges. Yet he shows us the lovable, fallible being trying out different forms through the epochs, sometimes lonely and sometimes not. And he gives Qfwfq such life, sweetness and enthusiasm that it's hard not to like him, even if we don't know exactly what he is.<br /><br />Then again, getting into specifics might wreck the funny, poignant \\"Cosmicomics\\" -- it's about love and the universe, and not even the lead character can distract from that.and, properly speaking, space itself, and time, and universal gravitation, and the gravitation universe, making possible billions and billions of suns, and of planets, and fields of wheat.\\" It takes a few minutes to sink in that Calvino wrote that the universe was first sparked by love.<br /><br />Calvino never really explains what Qfwfq is -- I suppose he's an atom or something of the sort, although how atoms have \\"long silvery arms\\" or build bamboo bridges.

So when she is told that archeologist Herr Schliemann has found the ruins of ancient Troy, she's determined to go investigate further. So she and her friends Brinnie, his wife Mary, and the knowledgeable oddball The Weed (not his real name) set out to Hissarlik. But things rapidly go awry.<br /><br />A sinister boat captain dumps them off in the wrong place, and a sputtering archaeologist -- who claims he, not Schliemann, has found Troy -- turns out to be working for the malevolent Dr. Helviticus. And this time, the doctor has far-reaching plans not only to take control of the world's oil, but to rule the world itself from his own luxurious Xanadu...<br /><br />In a sense, \\"The Xanadu\\" adventure is Alexander at his best. The story moves fast, the settings are exotic yet familiar, and there's a good blend of humor and action -- one of the best scenes is when an opulent palace goes up in flames, courtesy of Helviticus's superweapon. Alexander also indulges a more scholarly side -- he focuses on Schliemann and the discovery of Troy to kick off the adventure. Later on, Helviticus quotes extensively from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's legendary \\"Kubla Khan,\\" which Helviticus's own Xanadu is based on.<br /><br />But Alexander didn't just intend for this to be another Vesper Holly adventure. Sadly, it's the last one. So he wraps up a few personal threads for Holly, both involving Helviticus and concerning a certain young man. Alexander dips out of the action near the ending for a startlingly romantic scene, and the final scene is one of the sweetest he has ever written.<br /><br />Maybe the best thing about the Vesper Holly adventures is that Alexander doesn't turn her into a Lara Croft type. No blasting guns and acrobatics. Vesper uses her brain and wit as weapons against her brilliant opponent, with the assistance of her loyal pals. Although I did keep wondering why Helviticus would tell her every detail of his master plan as he did. Evil genius' prerogative, I suppose.<br /><br />The Vesper Holly series goes out with a bang in \\"The Xanadu Adventure,\\" which is a good adventure in its own right, and a good final adventure for Vesper and Co.adventures is that Alexander doesn't turn her into a Lara Croft type.

Without missing a step, \\"Lirael\\" follows in \\"Sabriel\\"'s footsteps, with the same dark blend of humor and horror.<br /><br />Lirael is a daughter of the Clayr, but she won't be a full Clayr until she gains the Sight. On her fourteenth birthday, she is the oldest girl to not yet have gained the Sight. After contemplating suicide, Lirael is assigned to work in the library, and inadvertantly sets loose a hideous Free Magic creature: a Stilken that will call other Free Magic creatures and destroy the Clayr. Desperate to deal with her mistake, Lirael calls up the Disreputable Dog (somehow made both of Free and Charter Magic) and soon ends up finding out more about her past -- and her future.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Sabriel's son Sameth is pursued by the Dead, and is almost killed in the process; the only thing he gets for his trouble is a threat from a mysterious necromancer. Sam is supposed to be the future Abhorsen, but the problem is that he's petrified by the things his mother handles easily. And he's helped loose Free Magic on a world increasingly torn by a mysterious masked necromancer...<br /><br />Nix takes the rich world he created in \\"Sabriel\\" and makes it even richer. It's a bit like a melding of typical high fantasy with an early twentieth-century setting (phones, buses, cricket matches, electricity, guns). Old faves like Sabriel, Touchstone, and Mogget appear here (although Mogget's appearance is a bit brief), along with new and equally likable characters.<br /><br />Some readers may not like Lirael as well as they liked the more self-assured, kick-butt Sabriel, but Sabriel knew who she was, where she was coming from, and knew what she needed to know. Lirael is only learning those things, which makes her a more vulnerable, confused heroine. She becomes stronger and more self-assured as she learns more about Charter magery and her background.<br /><br />\\"Lirael\\" has the same balance of humor and horror as the first book. We have things like the bodies of refugees being turned into decayed Dead Hands, the clawed insecto-human Stilken, or just the aura of darkness around the Book of the Dead. But we also have funny things like Nick or the running joke about the Dog and food.<br /><br />The Disreputable Dog is a lot like Mogget, in that she's more than she seems and a handy source of info, but not as quietly menacing as Mogget was. And Sam is endearingly unsure of himself, and is one of the few fantasy characters to be genuinely terrified of his \\"duties,\\" not just apprehensive. His sister was the one character who fell flat; she seemed a little too \\"bossy princess.\\"<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Lirael: Daughter of the Clayr\\" is that it ends on a \\"to be continued\\" note.

He studies the relationships she had with men from adolescence onward, particularly the asexual ones that she had with attractive heterosexual men, and the \\"a-loving\\" ones that she had with gay ones.<br /><br />That tendency, Amburn argues, took her through several unhappy marriages and plenty of explosive relationships, including ones that shattered assorted marriages. In the midst of all this, she also weathered health crises and worldwide censure with plenty of guts, becoming a sort of grande dame of the filmmaking business.<br /><br />Love her or hate her, Elizabeth Taylor is a larger-than-life figure, and there's plenty in her life to fuel a biography. Many biographers have managed to describe her lifetime with grace and taste, despite her sailor's mouth and tumultuous love life. She doesn't have to be portrayed as squeaky clean, just human.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amburn usually chooses to focus on the more grotesque aspects of Taylor's life. She delves into the sex lives (complete with sometimes disgusting details) of everyone who had been involved with Taylor, especially the gay men. Which, by the way, make up a lot of the book -- Amburn attaches the \\"gay\\" tag to quite a few men, including Taylor's two-time husband Richard Burton. That particular preoccupation hangs over the entire book like a stormcloud.<br /><br />Taste is nowhere to be found here -- Amburn has an almost obsessive interest in Taylor's breasts, and the penile details of her husbands, lovers and pals. What these things add to the history, she doesn't bother to say. The sledgehammer writing is that of a tabloid reporter, but without the restraints of an editor, Amburn appears to have gone wild.<br /><br />Taylor herself comes across as a blowsy diva, without a single redeeming characteristic except her acting skills. Not that she's alone; her husbands are all portrayed as walking disasters of alcoholism, gambling and physical abuse, and her kids are nonentities. The only person Amburn seems to have any liking for is Taylor's costar and friend Montgomery Clift, who is shown as a suffering saint.<br /><br />Ellis Amburn's \\"Elizabeth Taylor\\" is practically a how-to guide on how NOT to write a biography.

Everyone knows about the movie adaptation of \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" -- pod people, creepy takeover, lots of suspense. While the movie was good, the original novel is perhaps a more enjoyable story -- a creepy, tense novel that raises some intriguing questions about human nature.<br /><br />Dr. Miles Bennell receives an odd patient from his old ex-girlfriend Becky: Her cousin Wilma is making bizarre claims about her relatives. She claims that while they look, talk, dress and act just like Uncle Ira and Aunt Aleda, they are fakes. Miles talks with Wilma, but she doesn't show any typical signs of insanity. What's more, other people are insisting similar things about their friends and family -- that they seem just the same, but that they aren't themselves.<br /><br />Then things get more complicated. Miles's pal Jack and his wife Theodora have an \\"unfinished\\" person in their basement, a never-been-alive-and-not-living-now human being that is slowly turning into a duplicate of the real person. Growing out of alien pods that have migrated to our planet, the pod people are slowly and seductively working over the town -- and they will soon have the entire world.<br /><br />This now-classic SF book was published in the 1950s, before the advent of space opera and Star Wars. (It also has a noteworthy resemblance to Robert Heinlein's \\"Puppet Masters,\\" a similar book published four years before) Finney's book can be a bit dated in places -- for example the female characters are kind of wimpy -- they tend to get hysterical and follow the level-headed manly men. Fortunately these flaws are few and far between.<br /><br />The writing and dialogue are solid, not outstanding, but pretty good.  It does raise some interesting questions about human nature: In one scene, Miles is offered a life without strife by the pod people, and quickly turns it around to reveal that not only would a world of pod people be doomed, but also would have no drive, no enjoyment, no real living as we know it. It would all be bland, with no suffering but also no pleasure. Finney's writing is probably at its peak there, especially given the cold, pleasant attitude of the pod people -- no mustache-twirling and cackling for these villains.<br /><br />As with many first-person narrators, Miles is not a fantastic character, but he does develop a certain strength and intelligence as the story goes on. Writer pal Jack is a bit more interesting -- I wonder if he was a sort of alter ego for Finney. Becky and Theodora have secondary roles, but are nevetherless fairly good. All other supporting characters, unfortunately, are pretty forgettable.<br /><br />Though the movie deviated strongly from the book, fans of that film might want to check the origjnal story out anyway.

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

Witty, incisive and intelligent, Coupland's debut is still an outstanding read long after the original twentysomethings are twentysomething no more.<br /><br />Three twentysomethings -- Andy, Claire, and Dag -- first encounter each other in the California desert, far from their original homes. All three are \\"underemployed, overeducated, intensely private, and unpredictable,\\" and they are adrift in life -- they want meaning in their lives, but they don't know what it is or how to find it.<br /><br />Disgruntled by the soulles pop culture, they've all left the world behind in favor of a non-rat-race life. They take up unrewarding minimum-wage \\"McJobs,\\" and form a little Platonic circle that tells stories about themselves and the future, giving insights into what drove them to that place in the first place.<br /><br />\\"Generation X\\" is one of those rare books that takes on the problems of youth with genuine intelligence. No matter how many curmudgeons say that \\"kids today have it easy,\\" each generation has its own problems and challenges, including ones of the soul. It's those problems that Coupland seeks to address here.<br /><br />That intelligent edge has gotten the book labelled pretentious, but if anything it lacks pretension. Coupland is frank and upfront, both about his \\"slacker\\" protagonists, and in the attitude he has toward the world. He tackles the insecurities and dissatisfactions of youth, and how the people who came of age in the early 1990s struggled with the concept of a society in flux. They were too old to be innocent, too young to be fully benumbed.<br /><br />Coupland's writing is rougher here than in his later novels like \\"Shampoo Nation\\" and \\"Girlfriend in a Coma.\\" But it has his usual wry zing and offbeat style, stripped down to a mass of details and thoughts, and the ability to look at how the masses worry about things that don't really matter.

And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.<br /><br />We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \\"Mad Baggins\\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.<br /><br />Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.<br /><br />Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the \\"feel\\" of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.<br /><br />Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.<br /><br />One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.<br /><br />Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say \\"everyhobbit.\\"<br /><br />We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit to someone bolder and more decisive. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake.

That's only one of the problems that runs wild in Dennis McKiernan's \\"Voyage of the Fox Rider,\\" a brackish fantasy that takes forever to reach its destination.<br /><br />Tiny Fox Rider Jinnarin shows up at the elderly mage Alamar's door, asking for a favor. Her mate Farrix has gone missing, and now Jinnarin is having a strange nightmare that she believes is from him. Because Farrix once saved Alamar's life, the old mage agrees to help her, and ends up enlisting the Elven captain Aravan to sail them to wherever they can find Farrix.<br /><br />But then Alamar's daughter Aylis arrives, revealing that there is a bigger problem than Farrix's disappearance -- some evil mage may have kidnapped him. And as they draw closer to the evil mage and begin to unravel Jinnarin's strange dream, the heroes realize that there is more at stake than just a Fox Rider -- the whole of Mithgar may be in danger.<br /><br />It's not much to base a giant fantasy novel on -- a dream, a boat, some tarot cards and a vague idea about some evil wizard who has a giant dark gem. It would work better if \\"Voyage of the Fox Rider\\" were only two hundred pages long. As it is, the action slows to a trickle after they board the boat, and picks up only about fifty pages from the finale. Why was the middle even included?<br /><br />McKiernan badly needed an editor. His writing is merely okay at the best of times, but it's a disaster when he runs wild with it -- \\"Voyage\\" is riddled with repetitive conversations, endless arguing by everyone (except the nauseating lovers), tepid love scenes, political preaching. endless boat jargon, and lots of board games. His faux ye-olde language makes these boring scenes almost unbearable.<br /><br />The problem with a story like this is that the characters don't really know what they're looking for, and they're never sure what's going on around them. What's more, they're on a boat, with long stretches where they're just sailing, sailing, sailing. As a result, they spend half the book chasing red herrings and talking about philosophy, religion, and the nature of evil. It's very boring, and it adds nothing to the characters to have them quibbling about what is and is not evil.<br /><br />Not that McKiernan's characters are too endearing. Crabby mage Alamar is a likable old coot, but the others are either bland or annoying -- Jinnarin, despite being thousands of years old, has the shrill immaturity of a six-year-old brat. Cooing lovers Aylis and Aravan are either bland and sickeningly sweet. And the crew of the Eroean is made up of heavily-accented caricatures, ranging from a token black guy to a cartoonish Spaniard.<br /><br />\\"Voyage of the Fox Rider\\" might have been a decent book if McKiernan had cut out at least half of the middle section, and left out the one-note philosophy. As it is, it's about as much fun as being keelhauled.they're never sure what's going on around them. What's more, they're on a boat, with long stretches where they're just sailing, sailing, sailing.

The result is a gloriously witty social satire.<br /><br />It opens with two young women departing from a ladies' academy: dull, sweet Amelia (rich) and fiery sharp-witted Rebecca (poor). Becky Sharp is a relentless social climber, and her first effort to rise \\"above her station\\" is by trying to get Amelia's brother to marry her -- an effort thwarted by Amelia's fiancee. So instead she gets married to another family's second son, Rawdon Crawley.<br /><br />Unfortunately, both young couples quickly get disinherited and George is killed. But Becky is determined to live the good life she has worked and married for -- she obtains jewels and money from admiring gentlemen, disrupting her marriage. But a little thing like a tarnished reputation isn't enough to keep Becky down...<br /><br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is actually a lot more complex than that, with dozens of little subplots and complicated character relationships. Reading it a few times is necessary to really absorb all of it, since it is not just a look at the two women in the middle of the book, but at the upper (and sometimes lower) social strata of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />The main flaw of the book is perhaps that it sprawls too much -- there's always a lot of stuff going on, not to mention a huge cast of characters, and Thackeray sometimes drops the ball when it comes to the supporting characters and their little plots. It takes a lot of patience to absorb all of this. However... it's worth it.<br /><br />Like most nineteenth-century writers, Thackeray had a very dense, formal writing style -- but once you get used to it, his writing becomes insanely funny. Witticisms and quips litter the pages, even if you don't pick them all up at once. At first Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.<br /><br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her. Certainly life hasn't been fair for her. Next to Becky, a goody-goody character like Amelia is pretty boring, and even the unsubtle George can't measure up to Becky.<br /><br />To sum up \\"Vanity Fair\\": think a period soap opera with a heavy dose of social commentary.

But \\"Drama Queens: Wild Women of the Silver Screen\\" casts an entirely new light on actresses all through film history -- and it can be a not-so-pretty picture, with tantrums, weird affairs and feuds that lasted... well, forever.<br /><br />Autumn Stephens weaves in the actresses by personality rather than chronologically. At the beginning things were just as wild, with silent star Theda Bara (whose entire past was fabricated) and hedonistic Alla Nazimova (whose niece was Nancy Reagan). Later she handles stars that we still know of, such as \\"Mommy Dearest\\" Crawford, Bette Davis, aggressively sexpottish Mae West, the tragic Marilyn Monroe and Grace Kelly, and the Gabor sisters.<br /><br />Stephens doesn't neglect the lesser-known stars as well, such as those that many people don't know of: Hattie McDaniel, the gutsy lady who played Mammy in \\"Gone With The Wind\\"; Mary Minter, the faux virgin whose reputation (and career) went south when her lover died; the two nightmare wives of Rudy Valentino; and Lupe Velez, a sexy spitfire who committed suicide to avoid being an unwed mother. Yeah, that's a lot better.<br /><br />All thoroughly naughty, and pretty much the stuff of tabloid articles -- Stephens even sprinkles it with a few modern actresses, like Kim Basinger, Sharon Stone and Julia Roberts. Weirdly enough, these ladies seem relatively tame compared to their predecessors -- maybe it's because the standards were higher then (such as Ingrid Bergman's scandalous pregnancy), but somehow I don't think so. You can't really compete with garden orgies, slave bracelets and negative comments about Clark Gable's naughty bits.<br /><br />The only thing that keeps this from being pure fun is that it sort of putters off, into a part about female directors and producers. I don't know about you, but \\"wild women\\" doesn't really describe a lot of them. Better to focus on the salacious stuff -- that is the best material, and Stephens seems to have had fun compiling it all.<br /><br />As an added bonus -- and presumably to keep the book from being hundreds of pages long -- she sprinkles in some short tidbits about breast size in movies, odd reactions to the Oscars, how famous sexpots kept sexy, critics who incorrectly criticized some of the actresses, and their best lines (\\"I am a marvelous housekeeper,\\" Zsa Zsa Gabor said. \\"Every time I leave a man, I keep his house\\").<br /><br />Don't expect a lot of movie history or examination of how these ladies changed (or didn't change) Hollywood.

But his gimmick falls flat in \\"The Castle of Crossed Destinies,\\" a book that is intriguingly laid out, but never manages to be more than a curiosity.<br /><br />In the first section, a traveler comes to a castle full of other guests, but for some reason no one there is able to speak. To tell each other about their histories, they use a pack of tarot cards to communicate their stories -- tales about love affairs, ancient cities, and Faustian pacts.<br /><br />The second is pretty much the same, except that it takes place in a tavern, where mute people are still using tarot cards to describe their pasts. The stories -- evil queens, fallen warriors, even an Arthurian tale -- get darker and stranger, especially when the narrator himself began to describe his own past to the people who are watching him and the cards.<br /><br />As an idea, tarot cards being used to tell a story is brilliant. Especially since the stories that Calvino spins out are not necessarily the only interpretation -- each card used to tell the story can be interpreted differently. The problem is, in the first half of the book, Calvino tries to apply this to some very boring, straightforward little stories. They tend to stop suddenly, without much of a finale.<br /><br />The second half of the book uses this gimmick more skilfully, with Calvino writing in greater detail, and using more ornate, atmospheric writing. It feels less like stories wrapped around some cards, and more like stories with cards as illustrations of what might have been. He also adds a more eerie, macabre tale to this half, making it even more engaging.<br /><br />The first half sags in a big way; it's almost tiring to read. But the second half of \\"Castle of Crossed Destinies\\" is where Calvino's tarot gimmick starts to pay off. Interesting, but not all that it could have been.ve been.	2005-02-22

And in all of these, he showed himself to be a thoughtful, intelligent and very talented man.<br /><br />Over his lifetime, Stevens wrote several books of poetry, but his exquisite poems are best taken by themselves: the lush grandeur of \\"Sunday Morning,\\" the hymnlike \\"Le Monocle De Mon Oncle,\\" and the humid grittiness of \\"O Florida, Venereal Soil.\\" He takes multiple looks at \\"Thirteen Ways of Looking At A Blackbird,\\" and the lush \\"Six Significant Landscapes.\\"<br /><br />In other poems, Stevens dips into outright surrealism, like in the delicate \\"Tattoo\\" (\\"There are filaments of your eyes/On the surface of the water/And in the edges of the snow\\"), and also adds a meditative bent into \\"The Snow Man\\" (\\"For the listener, who listens in the snow,/And, nothing himself, beholds/Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is\\").<br /><br />But Stevens was a man of many talents -- there is a trio of one-act plays, erudite and a bit whimsical, and which have his usual thoughts on art and poetry woven into some of their passages. It is followed by the essay collection \\"The Necessary Angel,\\" which reflects on the nature of imagination, poetry, art, and the role of the poet in a society. His \\"uncollected\\" prose is not so tight -- there are literary experiments, snippets of atmospheric fiction, and sprawling essays on all sorts of subjects (\\"Cattle Kings of Florida\\"?). Even included are acceptance speeches and sound bites, like an enlightening little nugget on Walt Whitman.<br /><br />Finishing up the volume is a selection from Stevens' notebooks, ranging from puzzling (\\"Poetry is a metaphor\\") to revealing (\\"After one has abandoned a belief in God, poetry is that essence which takes its place as life's redemption\\"). And finally we get his letters and journals, which are friendly, relaxed, laid-back -- and still show that his mind was always thinking about his art.<br /><br />\\"Wallace Stevens: Collected Poetry And Prose\\" is probably the best way to get a full view of Stevens' work. And his mind, too -- his poetry gives little glimpses of his attitude toward the world and his art, but his essays and journals add to that. By the time you hit the final page, it's hard not to feel like you know Stevens.<br /><br />If nothing else, Stevens' writing can be read just because it is exquisitely beautiful. He lavished details all over almost every poem he wrote; his style tends to be a bit on the ornate side -- Stevens freely uses the more exotic terms -- such as \\"opalescence,\\" \\"pendentives\\" and \\"muleteers\\" -- wrapped up in complex verse, sometimes with a rhyme scheme and sometimes free-form.<br /><br />His prose style isn't any less impressive -- Stevens could lavish as much on his essays as he did in his poetry, and showed that he was very good at arguing his points. The last parts of the book are sprinkled with anecdotes about his travels, bits of poetry, and plenty of beautiful imagery (\\"The streets are blue with mist this morning\\").<br /><br />Wallace Stevens is known for his exquisite, lush poetry, but the full \\"Collected Poetry and Prose\\" shows just what an intelligent, cultured man he was.

The second volume picks up where the first left off, and Takahashi was obviously hitting her stride in this series.<br /><br />Directionally-challenged Ryoga Hibiki makes it to the Tendos' home, and brawls with Ranma out in the yard. Turns out that Ranma accidently knocked Ryoga into a cursed spring -- and now Ryoga turns into a cute black piglet. As if this grudge weren't enough, Akane adopts the piglet, whom she names \\"P-chan,\\" which drives Ranma into a frenzy.<br /><br />Problems continue when Akane is injured before a martial arts gymnastics competition, leaving Ranma (in his female form) to take her place.  The only problem is, it's against Kuno's psychotic sister Kodachi -- who loves Ranma as a boy, but loathes him as a girl. No sooner has Ranma dealt with that crisis than another combat challenge pops up: To get Ryoga/P-chan back from a ditzy ice skater, Ranma and Akane will have to learn martial-arts ice-skating. But Ranma's lessons take an unpleasant turn when he gets his first kiss... from a boy.<br /><br />The boy-turns-into-girl-when-splashed-with-water shtick sounds like a one-off gimmick. But Takahashi shows new ways to get creative in the second volume of \\"Ranma 1/2.\\" The stories flow a little faster and a little more smoothly, now that she's introduced the characters and their peculiar problems.<br /><br />She also starts ideas that continues throughout the series -- sticking the words \\"martial arts\\" besides all sorts of activities, and having characters fall into various cursed springs. But she doesn't lose track of the personal relationships, such as various characters competing for Ranma and/or Akane's affections. One comic gem involves siblings Kuno and Kodachi, who are unknowingly competing for the same person in different form.<br /><br />The characters have also changed a little. Akane no longer loathes all men, and is rapidly becoming a good partner for Ranma. Ryoga -- who apparently craves any form of affection -- falls in love with Akane after she cuddles him in his pig form. And obviously Ranma is starting to like Akane -- otherwise, why would he care if she cuddled Ryoga?<br /><br />The \\"Ranma 1/2\\" series took off after the first volume, when Takahashi stepped up the pace and took her martial-arts-romantic-comedy to new and strange heights.s have also changed a little.

Fantasy writer Jonathan Stroud tackled that sensitive topic in \\"The Leap,\\" an early novel that straddled the boundaries between reality and fantasy.<br /><br />Charlie nearly died trying to rescue her drowning pal Max, and now she's suffering from her grief and shock. She remembers strange green women dragging him down, yet no one believes her. But things change suddenly when she begins to have strange dreams, of a surreal land where Max is walking in the distance.<br /><br />In her dreams, Charlie encounters a strange man who tells her that Max is heading toward the Great Fair -- if he joins an alluring magic dance there, he will be lost forever. But the dreams are having a lasting effect on Charlie -- she's waking up with scratches, and thinks she sees wolves from her dream outside her house. Can she save Max, or will she herself be lost in the world of the dead?<br /><br />It's a credit to Stroud that while including elements of fantasy, he's able to portray grief and guilt so expertly. In fact, as good as the dream sequences are, the detached, erratic behavior that Charlie has in the real world is much, much more compelling.<br /><br />Stroud alternates between lush, descriptive writing in the dream realm, and more down-to-earth styles when Charlie is awake. And it's deeply affecting when he describes how the loss of Max has hit Charlie, her family, and his grieving parents. The only flaw is that we only get brief glimpses of Max; we never really get to know him.<br /><br />But Stroud hits the bulls-eye with Charlie and her family -- she's determined to save Max, and not willing to believe that he's gone. And her family is afraid that she's going insane. To keep things grounded, her brother James narrates some chapters, giving an idea of what her family thinks of her strange behavior. James thoughts are as powerful as Charlie's, out of fear that his sister is going bonkers.<br /><br />Stroud never quite explains whether the \\"dream world\\" events are real, but perhaps it's better that he left it that way. In the end, \\"The Leap\\" is a powerful tale about grief and love.out of fear that his sister is going bonkers. <br /> <br />Stroud never quite explains whether the \\"dream world\\" events are real, but perhaps it's better that he left it that way.

On the other, he seems uninterested in Brigitte Bardot as a person, and more as an icon. As the book goes on, it becomes obvious that Robinson cares more about worshiping Bardot than telling the world about her.<br /><br />Brigitte Bardot was born into a strict middle-class family, who considered actors \\"gypsies\\" and expected her to be a dancer. But her life changed when she met Roger Vadim, an energetic young film director who made her his muse, and married her as a teenager. Soon \\"B.B.\\" was a legend for her free-lovin' movies and sultry image.<br /><br />But B.B. wasn't as crazy about movies as the movies were crazy about her. While going through a succession of lovers and husbands that would make J.Lo proud, she quit the movies and devoted herself to animal care -- sometimes at the expense of the humans around her -- and living an ultra-reclusive life.<br /><br />Robinson does a passable job of telling Bardot's life story, from her life as a feted star to her work as an animal rights activist. That stuff is interesting. But he pads it out with stories about how amazing, wonderful and exquisite she is -- barely a page goes by without a quotation burbling about how extraordinary she is.<br /><br />The problem is, the way he tells it, she is not an exceptional person -- she comes across as a bit dizzy, rather bland, and alternately obnoxious and sweet. Oh yeah, and obsessed with lawsuits.  Not a single quote of hers is memorable, and only a few of her good deeds are. It's difficult to take Robinson's adoration seriously when he says in the epilogue that she is better than perfect, she's \\"unique.\\" Not the way he tells it.<br /><br />Were she not an exceptional beauty, it's doubtful anyone in this book have been so quick to talk about how glorious she is. As a person, she comes across as very, very ordinary.

While the two novellas \\"The Nonexistent Knight and The Cloven Viscount\\" are early work, his quirky satire and strange fantasy are in fine form here. The best description of Calvino's writing is: fairy tales for adults, which are smart and funny at the same time.<br /><br />\\"The Nonexistant Knight\\" opens with Charlemagne and his army preparing for a massive battle -- except that one knight named Agilulf is, technically, nonexistant. Okay, he's the very image of honor and chivalry, but he's also a walking empty suit of white armor. For some reason, Charlemagne doesn't seem disturbed by this.<br /><br />Fortunately, Agilulf is able to do his job despite not existing; Calvino's meditations on this are outstanding. Because of his ultra-perfection, Agilulf ends up attracting a naive young soldier, a feisty warrior woman, and an odd young knight who is looking for the Order of the Holy Grail. A Shakespearean tangle of sorts emerges before things start to sort themselves out...<br /><br />\\"The Cloven Viscount\\" is a simpler work: A viscount is hit by a Turkish cannonball that somehow splits him in half. Surprisingly, he's not dead -- they're able to save the right half of his body. But when the right half goes home, it becomes increasingly clear that it only has half the personality as well. And unfortunately, it's the evil half.<br /><br />As the various peasants try to deal with the viscount's vicious acts, the left half shows up as well. As it happens, the left half is the good half. He's also, despite his goody-goody personality, as much of a menace as the evil side. Can the two halves somehow get back into a whole man, or will they drive everyone else nuts?<br /><br />Italo Calvino's work is always a bit whimsical, but there is actual substance under the whimsy. For example, Agilulf is rigidly devoted to protocol and form, because he has nothing inside him. I'm pretty sure every person has met someone like Agilulf. Or, for that matter, glimpsed the two halves that lie inside every human being.<br /><br />Don't think it's all stuffy philosophy, though. One of Calvino's greatest talents was to make a hugely entertaining story that never became preachy, only funny.  While the subtext of \\"Viscount\\" is obvious, \\"Knight\\" is a sort of satire on medieval chivalry tales. And that is where Calvino excels; \\"Viscount,\\" while good, is a bit heavy-handed in places. But his macabre, slightly strange sense of humor keeps it from being goofy or preachy.<br /><br />His writing is formal, clear and evocative and starkly pretty, with only some key details. But it is peppered with funny lines and undignified characters. One of the best lines of \\"Knight\\" is at the beginning, where Charlemagne comments (entirely seriously), \\"Well, for someone who doesn't exist, you seem in fine form.\\"<br /><br />Calvino's offbeat parables and satires are always excellent, and his early pair of novellas are no exception. Funny, strange and thought-provoking, these are a pair of modern classics.met someone like Agilulf.

But exquisite, brief poems and colorful calligraphy are inextricably entwined in \\"Rainbows Appear: Tibetan Poems of Shabkar.\\" It's not quite a spiritual experience, but it's the next best thing.<br /><br />The poetry is taken from the autobiography of Shabkar Tsogdruk Rangdroi, a Buddhist mystic who taught and traveled across Tibet. His poetry is brief and hard-hitting, with powerful, simple sentiments: \\"Incense, flowers and lamps are not/the best offerings to the Buddha/the most beautiful gift to the Buddha/is good done for beings.\\" Okay, you don't have to be a Buddhist to appreciate the quiet instruction in this verse.<br /><br />Another striking thing about Shabkar's poetry is not just that it can be counted as spiritual instruction, but also that it contains beautiful metaphors, mostly from nature. In one verse, he compares himself to the sun, \\"resplendent with light,\\" and reflects that the sky will remain while the sun will not.<br /><br />What about the calligraphy? Jigme Doushe has lovely calligraphic skills, from what I can tell. And he makes his work come alive with bright colors mixed in with neutral tones -- one is simply fawn-colored with dark red and pale yellow, while another is electric blue and orange. Most tend toward neutrals, but are splashed with color.<br /><br />The two art forms complement each other, with the colorful calligraphy boosting the simple verses. And Doushe provides an afterword which sets the poetry, calligraphy and religion in their historical context, as well as giving some insights into his own artwork.<br /><br />It's strangely soothing to read Shabkar's peaceful poetry, while looking at Doushe's striking calligraphy. A beautiful little collection.	2005-02-13

They have to find the mysterious living Codex, which holds the answers to how to save their world -- and Tal's missing family. But more perils lie across Aenir, from waspwyrms to vicious birds to semi-dragons.<br /><br />The Codex instructs Tal to find the mysterious Hazror, and despite the warnings of the Storm Shepherd who accompanies him, Tal does manage to find Hazror... an old Chosen who has killed many people who ventured into Aenir. Will they find their answers, and escape Aenir alive?<br /><br />The idea of dreamworlds and living shadows would seem stupid in most fantasy series. But Garth Nix actually manages to carry it off -- \\"Aenir\\" can be somewhat confusing, but once readers get everything straight, its remarkable imagination begins to shine through.<br /><br />Not a lot of time is spent in Tal's lightless, icy world in this book; it mostly takes place in Aenir. Nix manages to create a sort of lucid dream, where things make logical sense, but they can be nightmarish and bizarre. He also gives the story a tragic twist for Tal, and deepens the mystery of the malevolent Sushin, who has been making trouble for Tal ever since the first book.<br /><br />There's not a lot of character development in this book, since Tal and Milla's personalities were formed over the past two novels. Most of this book is action. But Nix does introduce two likable characters -- Odris and Adras, a pair of Storm Shepherds who provide guidance and comic relief for our heroes.<br /><br />Things get stranger and tenser in the third volume of the Seventh Tower series, and only promise to get better after \\"Aenir.\\" Definitely worth reading.enir.\\" Definitely worth reading.	2005-02-12

But apparently American politicians can't even begin to match European royals for scandal production. \\"A Treasury of Great American Scandals\\" aspires to let us glimpse our prezzes and politicians in their nastier, naughter moments. But there's too little scandal and too much catfighting.<br /><br />It begins at the very start of the United States -- George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. Not only did they have to win the Revolution, but these poor guys had problems at home too. For example, poor George had to deal with his neurotic, whiny mother embarrassing him publicly, and Jefferson had a \\"simple\\" brother whom he had to pick up the slack for. Amazing that they had time to break loose from the British Empire.<br /><br />The problem is that very little of the book is actually scandal. Most of it is infighting -- Adams and Jefferson loathed each other until they retired, Franklin disowned his loyalist son, Aaron Burr fought a duel, and the extended Roosevelt family despised F.D.R. Sad, maybe, but hardly scandalous and not terribly \\"tantalizing.\\" In fact, it gets a bit dull after awhile, listening to historical anecdotes but not finding anything too shocking.<br /><br />There are some genuinely intriguing stories, such as Mary Lincoln's insanity, graverobbing, \\"Ima Hogg,\\" the Salem Witch trials and more. And what DID happen on Governer Houston's wedding night? However, none of this is scandalous. And it fails to measure up to the tumultuous controversies of the Clinton administration. Or the Kennedy family, whose past anti-Semitism is only briefly touched on.<br /><br />Michael Farquhar just doesn't manage the level of wit that the book demands -- his writing tends to be rather plodding and gets tedious after awhile. He also doesn't seem to have done much research, such as neglecting to mention that Randolph Jefferson, not his brother, may have fathered slave Sally Hemmings' children. That's a pretty big omission, especially since poor Randolph is most of the \\"scandal\\" surrounding Jefferson.<br /><br />\\"A Treasury of Great American Scandals\\" is a deceptive title -- there's little scandal, and nothing really great here.

The result is a gloriously witty social satire.<br /><br />It opens with two young women departing from a ladies' academy: dull, sweet Amelia (rich) and fiery sharp-witted Rebecca (poor). Becky Sharp is a relentless social climber, and her first effort to rise \\"above her station\\" is by trying to get Amelia's brother to marry her -- an effort thwarted by Amelia's fiancee. So instead she gets married to another family's second son, Rawdon Crawley.<br /><br />Unfortunately, both young couples quickly get disinherited and George is killed. But Becky is determined to live the good life she has worked and married for -- she obtains jewels and money from admiring gentlemen, disrupting her marriage. But a little thing like a tarnished reputation isn't enough to keep Becky down...<br /><br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is actually a lot more complex than that, with dozens of little subplots and complicated character relationships. Reading it a few times is necessary to really absorb all of it, since it is not just a look at the two women in the middle of the book, but at the upper (and sometimes lower) social strata of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />The main flaw of the book is perhaps that it sprawls too much -- there's always a lot of stuff going on, not to mention a huge cast of characters, and Thackeray sometimes drops the ball when it comes to the supporting characters and their little plots. It takes a lot of patience to absorb all of this. However... it's worth it.<br /><br />Like most nineteenth-century writers, Thackeray had a very dense, formal writing style -- but once you get used to it, his writing becomes insanely funny. Witticisms and quips litter the pages, even if you don't pick them all up at once. At first Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.<br /><br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her. Certainly life hasn't been fair for her. Next to Becky, a goody-goody character like Amelia is pretty boring, and even the unsubtle George can't measure up to Becky.<br /><br />To sum up \\"Vanity Fair\\": think a period soap opera with a heavy dose of social commentary. In other words, it doesn't get much better than this, Thackeray's masterpiece.Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.   <br />  <br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her.

One definition of metafiction is \\"Fiction that deals, often playfully and self-referentially, with the writing of fiction or its conventions.\\" That could pretty much describe Italo Calvino's \\"If On A Winter's Night A Traveler,\\" a gloriously surreal story about the hunt for a mysterious book.<br /><br />A reader opens Italo Calvino's latest novel, \\"If On A Winter's Night A Traveller,\\" only to have the story cut short. Turns out it was a defective copy, with another book's pages inside. But as the reader tries to find out what book the defective pages belong to, he keeps running into even more books and more difficulties --  as well as the beautiful Ludmilla, a fellow reader who also received a defective book.<br /><br />With Ludmilla assisting him (and, he hopes, going to date him), the reader then explores obscure dead languages, publishers' shops, bizarre translators and various other obstacles. All he wants is to read an intriguing book. But he keeps stumbling into tales of murder and sorrow, annoying professors, and the occasional radical feminist -- and a strange literary conspiracy. Will he ever finish the book?<br /><br />In its own way, \\"If On A Winter's Night A Traveler\\" is a mystery story, a satire, a romance, and a treasure hunt. Any book whose first chapter explains how you're supposed to read it has got to be a winner -- \\"You are about to begin reading Italo Calvino's new novel, \\"If On A Winter's Night a Traveler.\\" Relax. Concentrate.\\" And so on, with Calvino gently joking and chiding the reader before actually beginning his strange little tale.<br /><br />As cute as that first chapter is, it also sets the tone for this strange, funny metafictional tale, which not only inserts Calvino but the reader. That's right -- this book is written in the second person, with the reader as the main character. \\"You did this\\" and \\"you did that,\\" and so on. Only a few authors are brave enough to insert the reader... especially in a novel about a novel that contains other novels. It seems like a subtle undermining of reality itself.<br /><br />It's a bit disorienting when Calvino inserts chapters from the various books that \\"you\\" unearth -- including ghosts, hidden identities, Mexican duels, Japanese erotica, and others written in the required styles. Including some cultures that he made up. Upon further reading, those isolated chapters reveal themselves to be almost as intriguing as the literary hunt. Especially since each one cuts off at the most suspenseful moment -- what happens next? Nobody knows!<br /><br />It all sounds hideously confusing, but Calvino's deft touch and sense of humor keep it from getting too weird. There are moments of wink-nudge comedy, as well as the occasional poke at the publishing industry. But Calvino also provides chilling moments, mildly sexy ones, and a tone of mystery hangs over the whole novel.<br /><br />At times it feels like Calvino is in charge of \\"If On A Winter's Night A Traveler\\"... and at other times, it feels like \\"you\\" are the one at the wheel.

Patricia Kennealy-Morrison has something all right, but her obnoxious attitude and sketchy details make it hard to regard \\"Strange Days: My Life With And Without Jim Morrison\\" as much more than a curiosity.<br /><br />Kennealy-Morrison was a journalist/editor working for Jazz'n'Pop magazine in the late 1960s. She was sent in to interview legendary rock bad boy Jim Morrison of the Doors, and was immediately impressed by him (the feeling was mutual, she says). They soon struck up a friendship, then became lovers while remaining on opposite sides of the United States.<br /><br />Morrison and Kennealy-Morrison wed in a witch handfasting some months later, despite the fact that Morrison was still with his longtime lover Pamela Courson. Kennealy-Morrison chronicles the remainder of their increasingly volatile relationship, her abortion, Morrison's mysterious death in Paris, and the production of the distorted movie adaptation by Oliver Stone.<br /><br />Never has so much been written over so little. Not very often, anyway. Morrison's brief involvement with Kennealy-Morrison is blown up into an affair to rival Guinevere and Lancelot -- and yes, that's her own comparison. What an unbiased reader sees is a rather average rock romance, full of the necessary sex, drugs and rock'n'roll. And lots and lots of Kennealy-Morrison's everyday life.<br /><br />Kennealy-Morrison has a curiously self-centered view of the world: whenever anybody is less than friendly to her, they must be upset over her gender, brains, religion or relationship with Morrison. Her attitude (a bull getting ready to charge at a matador) wears thin quickly. She heaps scorn on almost all rock'n'roll stars, on any girl who slept (or wanted to) with Jim, on any friend of Pamela Courson's, on Doors fans, on rock audiences... pretty much everybody. Special vitriol is reserved for Pam. Rather than take Morrison to task for his behavior, Kennealy-Morrison vents on the pleasant, clueless Courson.<br /><br />While Kennealy-Morrison is clearly knowledgeable, she seems to use her IQ solely to set herself above the groupies. She lacks the class, wisdom and vibrance of other rock paramours like Marianne Faithfull, or the sweetness of Bebe Buell. If this book is anything to go by, her intellect is stagnant and unsophisticated, and her personality is childish (she beats a groupie for coming on to Jim). In fact, her claims that she's a strong, decisive, take-no-guff woman becomes funny when you see that she was allowing a ridiculous amount of guff from Morrison.<br /><br />There's no denying that Kennealy-Morrison is a talented writer. At times her lyrical, detailed writing makes this seem almost like a novel. It's especially vibrant during scenes like Doors concerts and the famous Woodstock. But too often her words are used as arrows rather than paintbrushes.<br /><br />\\"Strange Days: My Life With And Without Jim Morrison\\" is a weird read. In the end, it's hard to see it as anything but Kennealy-Morrison's side of the story, but without any wisdom brought by time and thought.

Dunkle returns to the world of \\"The Hollow Kingdom\\" with \\"Close Kin,\\" a romantic adventure that stretches the boundaries of her invented world. Though this book is a bit too rushed, Dunkle's mix of humor and suspense carry the story smoothly as we find out a bit more about the mysterious elves.<br /><br />Seylin the elf-goblin has been Emily's friend ever since she came to live with the goblins, and he has now fallen in love with her. When she absentmindedly rejects him, the brokenhearted Seylin decides to go find other elves. He manages to track down a camp of them -- but he finds that they have little in common.<br /><br />The band leader is a brutal thug, the elves live in poverty, and the women are treated as scum... and all elf women die horribly in childbirth. Meanwhile, determined to find Seylin, Emily sets out accompanied by a crabby loremaster. Both she and Seylin discover the tragic joint past of the elves and goblins, and the terrible secret that is driving the elves toward extinction.<br /><br />\\"Close Kin\\" takes a darker tone than its predecessor. Sure, \\"Hollow Kingdom\\" wasn't light and fluffy, but \\"Close Kin\\" explores the terrible aftermath of wars and misunderstandings. One scene even has an elf woman mutilating her face so no one will marry her. Yep, it gets that heavy, although Dunkle lightens up somewhat after the \\"kidnapping\\" of the elf brides.<br /><br />It does rush past the romance a bit more quickly than you'd expect, and the elf women adjust to the feared goblins in way too little time. However, most of the plot moves at a fast clip, giving us plenty of looks at the grimy elf camp and the bloody history between the two races. There's certainly enough backstory to provide plenty of prequels, if Ms. Dunkle chose to write them.<br /><br />Seylin gets plenty of dimension and angst to go along with his interesting elf-cat-goblin shapeshifting. Emily doesn't get much personal growth, sadly. But Dunkle also populates \\"Close Kin\\" with plenty of other interesting characters, such as a ditzy elf, a crabby priest, a little girl with her head full of fairy-tales, and a goblin street urchin (who is, incidentally, the most entertaining character in the whole book).<br /><br />The final chapter of \\"Close Kin\\" seems to hint at the third book of the Hollow Kingdom Trilogy, and it sounds like the third venture into the kingdom of the goblins will be winner.with plenty of other interesting characters, such as a ditzy elf, a crabby priest, a little girl with her head full of fairy-tales, and a goblin street urchin (who is, incidentally, the most entertaining character in the whole book). <br /> <br />The final chapter of \\"Close Kin\\" seems to hint at the third book of the Hollow Kingdom Trilogy, and it sounds like the third venture into the kingdom of the goblins will be winner.	2005-02-08

Everyone knows about the movie adaptation of \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" -- pod people, creepy takeover, lots of suspense. While the movie was good, the original novel is perhaps a more enjoyable story -- a creepy, tense novel that raises some intriguing questions about human nature.<br /><br />Dr. Miles Bennell receives an odd patient from his old ex-girlfriend Becky: Her cousin Wilma is making bizarre claims about her relatives. She claims that while they look, talk, dress and act just like Uncle Ira and Aunt Aleda, they are fakes. Miles talks with Wilma, but she doesn't show any typical signs of insanity. What's more, other people are insisting similar things about their friends and family -- that they seem just the same, but that they aren't themselves.<br /><br />Then things get more complicated. Miles's pal Jack and his wife Theodora have an \\"unfinished\\" person in their basement, a never-been-alive-and-not-living-now human being that is slowly turning into a duplicate of the real person. Growing out of alien pods that have migrated to our planet, the pod people are slowly and seductively working over the town -- and they will soon have the entire world.<br /><br />This now-classic SF book was published in the 1950s, before the advent of space opera and Star Wars. (It also has a noteworthy resemblance to Robert Heinlein's \\"Puppet Masters,\\" a similar book published four years before) Finney's book can be a bit dated in places -- for example the female characters are kind of wimpy -- they tend to get hysterical and follow the level-headed manly men. Fortunately these flaws are few and far between.<br /><br />The writing and dialogue are solid, not outstanding, but pretty good.  It does raise some interesting questions about human nature: In one scene, Miles is offered a life without strife by the pod people, and quickly turns it around to reveal that not only would a world of pod people be doomed, but also would have no drive, no enjoyment, no real living as we know it. It would all be bland, with no suffering but also no pleasure. Finney's writing is probably at its peak there, especially given the cold, pleasant attitude of the pod people -- no mustache-twirling and cackling for these villains.<br /><br />As with many first-person narrators, Miles is not a fantastic character, but he does develop a certain strength and intelligence as the story goes on. Writer pal Jack is a bit more interesting -- I wonder if he was a sort of alter ego for Finney. Becky and Theodora have secondary roles, but are nevetherless fairly good. All other supporting characters, unfortunately, are pretty forgettable.<br /><br />Though the movie deviated strongly from the book, fans of that film might want to check the origjnal story out anyway.

All other supporting characters, unfortunately, are pretty forgettable. <br /> <br />Though the movie deviated strongly from the book, fans of that film might want to check the origjnal story out anyway. Interesting and pretty well-written, especially for fans of horror/SF.	2005-02-06

The result is a gloriously witty social satire.<br /><br />It opens with two young women departing from a ladies' academy: dull, sweet Amelia (rich) and fiery sharp-witted Rebecca (poor). Becky Sharp is a relentless social climber, and her first effort to rise \\"above her station\\" is by trying to get Amelia's brother to marry her -- an effort thwarted by Amelia's fiancee. So instead she gets married to another family's second son, Rawdon Crawley.<br /><br />Unfortunately, both young couples quickly get disinherited and George is killed. But Becky is determined to live the good life she has worked and married for -- she obtains jewels and money from admiring gentlemen, disrupting her marriage. But a little thing like a tarnished reputation isn't enough to keep Becky down...<br /><br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is actually a lot more complex than that, with dozens of little subplots and complicated character relationships. Reading it a few times is necessary to really absorb all of it, since it is not just a look at the two women in the middle of the book, but at the upper (and sometimes lower) social strata of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />The main flaw of the book is perhaps that it sprawls too much -- there's always a lot of stuff going on, not to mention a huge cast of characters, and Thackeray sometimes drops the ball when it comes to the supporting characters and their little plots. It takes a lot of patience to absorb all of this. However... it's worth it.<br /><br />Like most nineteenth-century writers, Thackeray had a very dense, formal writing style -- but once you get used to it, his writing becomes insanely funny. Witticisms and quips litter the pages, even if you don't pick them all up at once. At first Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.<br /><br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her. Certainly life hasn't been fair for her. Next to Becky, a goody-goody character like Amelia is pretty boring, and even the unsubtle George can't measure up to Becky.<br /><br />To sum up \\"Vanity Fair\\": think a period soap opera with a heavy dose of social commentary. In other words, it doesn't get much better than this, Thackeray's masterpiece.seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.  <br /> <br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her.

The same could be said of Douglas Coupland's writing -- particularly this book, \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" a look at mortality and loneliness. It's not his finest or most insightful, but it has wit and heart.<br /><br />Middle-aged Liz Dunn is crabby, lonely and fat. After dental surgery, she seals herself in her apartment with a stack of sad movies, until she receives a shocking phone call. A young man ODed and ended up in the hospital -- and he claims to her son, the result of a drunken tryst when she was only a teenager in Rome. For the first time, Liz finds herself actually having to be a mom.<br /><br />As if that weren't enough of a shock, Jeremy is also dying of multiple schlerosis. But he is also chipper and upbeat, unwilling to let his impending death get him down. The mother and son start to get to know each other, with the bittersweet knowledge that whatever bond they form is temporary. But Jeremy's mere presence is enough to change Liz forever.<br /><br />Yeah, it sounds like a Lifetime tear-jerker. Fortunately, Douglas Coupland is able to yank the seemingly ordinary plot up by its acid-wit shoestrings. He isn't exactly known for his chipper outlook on life, but there's a certain poignant optimism to this novel. Its most memorable line is \\"Death without the possibility of changing the world was the same as a life that never was,\\" challenging the bleak life that Liz is living, and defining the too-short life her son had.<br /><br />At times, Coupland seems a bit too flip about Jeremy's M.S. Maybe that humor keeps the book from becoming morbid. The tone is also intimate than his prior books, since it focuses mainly on two people. His smooth, stripped-down writing style is intact, along with dry witticisms. But Coupland's acerbic style hides a surprisingly sweet center.<br /><br />Liz is quite possibly the funniest lonely person in modern literature -- she takes her private misery and constantly makes fun of it, but not enough to make us take her lightly. And Jeremy is a character who easily could have been insufferable, if Coupland hadn't made him so earnest.<br /><br />Coupland's ninth novel is an ode to all the lonely people -- especially those who don't necessarily have to be lonely. \\"All the lonely people, where do they all come from?/All the lonely people, where do they all belong?\\"he takes her private misery and constantly makes fun of it, but not enough to make us take her lightly.

And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.<br /><br />Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).<br /><br />So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.<br /><br />Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.<br /><br />The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but multidimensional and immensely interesting to read about.<br /><br />\\"The Hobbit\\" was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much.

Me too. So it is with Stanley Booth and \\"Keith: Standing in the Shadows,\\" a biography that has been stripped down to the barest bones of Keith Richards' life.<br /><br />The main focus of the book is Keith as Rolling Stone -- his childhood is handled in relatively few pages, and the book kicks in as he meets Mick Jagger for the first time. From there it follows Richards from a rather stormy middle-class youth to life as one of the biggest rock stars in the world. And, additionally, into the depths of addiction and self-destruction, and how he managed to crawl out before it could kill him.<br /><br />But the problem is that Booth seems to be getting a bit TOO respectful of Richards, and doesn't dip more than a toe into Richards' personal life. His destructive, loving, dynamic relationship with Anita Pallenberg is put on the sidelines, as is his marriage to Patti Hansen and the death of his third child. The poor kid doesn't merit more than one sentence, despite the devastation it caused his parents.<br /><br />The problem is, the stay-out-of-personal-lives approach does not work in the biography of an artist -- several songs were written about events in Richards' life. For example, Booth doesn't bother to note that Linda Keith was anything other than Richards' girlfriend du jour, but he apparently wrote \\"Ruby Tuesday\\" about her and considered her his first love. His music and personal life can't be easily separated.<br /><br />That hands-off approach ruins most of the book -- while it has some interesting anecdotes, like the first tape of \\"Satisfaction\\" ever made, it feels as though Booth is just showing us a few pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. Where is the rest? He never tells us, only gives us a few tantalizing glimpses and not a great deal more.<br /><br />What is more, Booth displays a rather boring writing style here. Richards' life has been a colorful and sometimes explosive one, but it sounds positively dull here -- the most exciting parts of the whole book are when Richards himself is being quoted. Those anecdotes make the book come alive in places.<br /><br />Stanley Booth's business-only approach to Keith Richards causes a major stumble in what could have been a really good book. But the end result is very, very dull.explosive one, but it sounds positively dull here -- the most exciting parts of the whole book are when Richards himself is being quoted.

Books	3	8	8	N	N	"P.S."... what?	\\"P.S.\\" raises an interesting question: what if you had a second chance with someone who is -- or is very like -- your first and only real love? Helen Schulman makes a real effort to delve into the questions about love, lust, memories, and reincarnation... but she never quite figures out how to answer those questions.<br /><br />Years ago, Louisa was in love with Scott Feinstadt, a sexy charmer who died abruptly, leaving her teenage emotions up in the air. Now she is thirty-eight, divorced from a sex-addicted husband, and living a dull life as a college admissions administrator. Enter F. Scott Feinstadt, a hunky young student who is the spitting image of her dead lover.<br /><br />Soon Louisa has taken up with F. Scott again, feeling as if she's been given a second chance with the man she loved -- their age differences and different lives make no difference. But what does make a difference is Louisa's ex-husband and her catty best friend. And when her friend spills the beans about Louisa's two Scott Feinstadts, it may destroy her new relationship.<br /><br />As an idea, \\"P.S.\\" can't be matched. Schulman dives headfirst into a sort of metaphysical (and VERY physical) tale that just avoids being a Mrs. Robinson story. Is F. Scott a reincarnation, a son, or a cosmic sign? It's also a very compelling story of a woman approaching middle-age, who is looking back on a life devoid of passion and happiness.<br /><br />What it lacks is a real answer to its own questions. Okay, the ending decides what F. Scott isn't -- but it never tells us what he is either. The similarities between him and his predecessor never quite get explained, but there are too many of them for it to be a coincidence. It sort of putters slowly to a stop, and Schulman's glossy writing can't hide its problems.<br /><br />Louisa may also annoy readers, since she's a bit of a doormat -- she married a guy she didn't love and stays vaguely interested even though he's a louse. And she remains friends with a woman who seems determined to wreck her life. Why does she have anything to do with these losers? The confused F. Scott is a more likable guy, especially since he's definitely an upgrade from the original model -- he's sweeter, more sensitive, and more monogamous.<br /><br />\\"P.S.\\" has some good idea lurking behind the story, but Helen Schulman seems to have written it without a clear idea of how to explain it.

But the Gray family's lives change when a wealthy young widow, Sylvia Cary, comes to live with them. She soon uses her money to help them in every possible way -- trips to Europe, music lessons, rebuilding the house, and modernizing the farm in every way.<br /><br />She particularly changes the life of the resentful Austin Gray, who also learns about the painful secrets she's hiding. He begins to fall in love with her, despite the fact that several other men -- including his brother Thomas -- are also in love with her.  But in the middle of teen pregnancies and Sylvia's tragic past, can a farmer and a society girl actually make it work?<br /><br />Frances Parkinson Keyes published \\"The Old Gray Homestead\\" shortly after her husband entered the Senate, which was the start of a long career as a bestselling fiction writer. Her books tend to be a bit formulaic, but she did expand her range to include romances, murder mysteries, political dramas and war stories.<br /><br />Keyes' first book reads like one -- Austin literally goes from loathing to loving Sylvia overnight, and the plot has few twists except Edith's pregnancy. Her writing is a mix of 20th-century informality and 19-century slowness, although this one leans more on the 19th-century. The conventions are a bit old, as is the vision of an early-twentieth-century small town which is aghast at movies and dances.<br /><br />Keyes also does a passable job with her cast of characters, but few of them are ever fully fleshed out. Sylvia is a pretty solid heroine, given her past with an abusive husband and two dead babies, but Austin is almost a cliche of the brooding rough-cut man. Most of the others, like Thomas and hired boy Peter, are in the story just long enough to fulfil their purposes, then vanish.<br /><br />\\"The Old Gray Homestead\\" is an interesting love story set in a rapidly changing era, with some of the flaws of the first-time author.

One definition of metafiction is \\"Fiction that deals, often playfully and self-referentially, with the writing of fiction or its conventions.\\" That could pretty much describe Italo Calvino's \\"If On A Winter's Night A Traveler,\\" a gloriously surreal story about the hunt for a mysterious book.<br /><br />A reader opens Italo Calvino's latest novel, \\"If On A Winter's Night A Traveller,\\" only to have the story cut short. Turns out it was a defective copy, with another book's pages inside. But as the reader tries to find out what book the defective pages belong to, he keeps running into even more books and more difficulties --  as well as the beautiful Ludmilla, a fellow reader who also received a defective book.<br /><br />With Ludmilla assisting him (and, he hopes, going to date him), the reader then explores obscure dead languages, publishers' shops, bizarre translators and various other obstacles. All he wants is to read an intriguing book. But he keeps stumbling into tales of murder and sorrow, annoying professors, and the occasional radical feminist -- and a strange literary conspiracy. Will he ever finish the book?<br /><br />In its own way, \\"If On A Winter's Night A Traveler\\" is a mystery story, a satire, a romance, and a treasure hunt. Any book whose first chapter explains how you're supposed to read it has got to be a winner -- \\"You are about to begin reading Italo Calvino's new novel, \\"If On A Winter's Night a Traveler.\\" Relax. Concentrate.\\" And so on, with Calvino gently joking and chiding the reader before actually beginning his strange little tale.<br /><br />As cute as that first chapter is, it also sets the tone for this strange, funny metafictional tale, which not only inserts Calvino but the reader. That's right -- this book is written in the second person, with the reader as the main character. \\"You did this\\" and \\"you did that,\\" and so on. Only a few authors are brave enough to insert the reader... especially in a novel about a novel that contains other novels. It seems like a subtle undermining of reality itself.<br /><br />It's a bit disorienting when Calvino inserts chapters from the various books that \\"you\\" unearth -- including ghosts, hidden identities, Mexican duels, Japanese erotica, and others written in the required styles. Including some cultures that he made up. Upon further reading, those isolated chapters reveal themselves to be almost as intriguing as the literary hunt. Especially since each one cuts off at the most suspenseful moment -- what happens next? Nobody knows!<br /><br />It all sounds hideously confusing, but Calvino's deft touch and sense of humor keep it from getting too weird. There are moments of wink-nudge comedy, as well as the occasional poke at the publishing industry. But Calvino also provides chilling moments, mildly sexy ones, and a tone of mystery hangs over the whole novel.<br /><br />At times it feels like Calvino is in charge of \\"If On A Winter's Night A Traveler\\"... and at other times, it feels like \\"you\\" are the one at the wheel.

Now with the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It has quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it, set the tone for most fantasy ever since, topped many \\"best book\\" polls, and helped spawn such entertainment phenomena as \\"Star Wars.\\"<br /><br />Following up on events in \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" stars the quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.<br /><br />\\"The Two Towers\\" begins directly after \\"Fellowship,\\" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them. His cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs from the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.<br /><br />\\"Return of the King\\" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.<br /><br />\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.<br /><br />Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual. Merry and Pippin start out a bit flaky, but are matured by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue ranges from goofy and hilarious to solemn and archaic, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary; if you don't have a good attention span, then you won't be able to handle this story. If you do, then probably you can.<br /><br />Even after all the years, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" stillrules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and few books have even come close to equalling it.rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature.

Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.<br /><br />The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter -- each is given his own quirks and strengths.<br /><br />With the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie trilogy solidly entrenched in pop culture, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" is now receiving a well-deserved boost of attention. Rarely has a bedtime story for children become such a beloved story.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness.

Her third novel continues the offbeat characters and dark, quirky writing. \\"Cherries in the Snow\\" is a bit like its namesake -- bright and engaging.<br /><br />Sadie Steinberg is a British twentysomething living in New York, and employed at chic Grrl Cosmetics. Her job? She comes up with the kicky nicknames for makeup, like \\"Ass-Slapping Pink\\" and \\"Born To Run,\\" (yes, I'd love that job too) and aspires to create a name as memorable as \\"Cherries in the Snow.\\" Lipstick is also a barometer for her moods. Some people wear their hearts on their sleeves, but Sadie wears hers on her mouth.<br /><br />Then her love life takes a radical shift, after way too many \\"father figure\\" men (Dr. Freud, you may now leave the stage) who are twice her age. One day Sadie encounters hippie-esque graffiti artist Marley, and they fall in love. But Sadie has a rival for his affections: his young daughter Montana, who eerily reminds Sadie of herself.<br /><br />Sounds like your typical chick-lit? Trust me, it's not -- at least, it's not the fluffy twenty-something-woman-in-love stuff that is churned out on a monthly basis. Emma Forrest is far wittier and more flippant, sort of like if Nick Hornby had been born a girl. To dismiss \\"Cherries in the Snow\\" as \\"chick-lit\\" is a disservice of the worst kind.<br /><br />Forrest's writing has grown up a bit since her debut novel, \\"Namedropper.\\" There are echoes of her earlier work -- Holly in particular reminds one of sexy, free-spirited Treena -- but Forrest's writing has become a bit deeper over time. Here, she's taking a harder look at friendships, love affairs, and dating men with children.<br /><br />But if her themes have gotten deeper, Forrest hasn't lost her knack for acidic observation. Or, for that matter, her ability to steep her books in pop culture without making them seem trendy or gimmicky. On the subject of Holly, Sadie muses that \\"you have that intense, romantic love for your best friend and if it ends, the breakup is absolutely traumatizing.\\" Insights like those can cut like a knife.<br /><br />The cover of \\"Cherries in the Snow\\" sums up the book pretty well.

Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series debuted in the slow, ponderous \\"Eye of the World.\\" The follow up is \\"The Great Hunt,\\" with a slightly better plot and some Machievellian intrigues, but the first half \\"The Hunt Begins: The Great Hunt, Part 1\\" only illuminates Jordan's many writing flaws.<br /><br />Rand and company have arrived at the home of the Aes Sedai, the female sorceresses who now hold his fate in their collective hands -- because he can do magic, albeit by accident, they might \\"gentle\\" him. What he doesn't know is that Moraine and the Aes Sedai leader, the Amyrlin, are secretly plotting to keep him safe -- because they suspect he is the Dragon Reborn.<br /><br />All the Aes Sedai intrigues are interrupted when the stronghold is invaded by trollocs and a Myrdraal -- and a message for Rand is scrawled on the wall in blood. Turns out that they were stealing the legendary Horn of Valere, which can raise dead heroes. So Rand and his friends -- including Mat, whose life is bound to a stolen dagger -- go out in search of the horn.<br /><br />Robert Jordan's books are slow. Really slow. Incredibly slow -- the hero, Rand, spends a hundred pages fretting about something that never happens. He spends an entire chapter getting dressed. Long books -- Dosteyevsky, Thackeray, Tolkien -- are often good things, richly nuanced and full of intricate plotting. But Jordan just seems to be describing everything in detail.<br /><br />The plot itself has promise -- the action scenes tend to be swift, gritty and tense; the idea of a stolen horn that can raise the dead is an intriguing one. But between it is endless pages of quibbling and personal tics, as well as dozens of minor characters who have no bearing on the plot. For example, Jordan introduces countless Aes Sedai, but only two other than Moraine have any plot purpose.<br /><br />Sadly, Jordan's writing isn't up to the challenge -- he reads like a second-rate pulp writer. The force of ultimate evil is called Shai'tan (can't he come up with a better name?), and just stops short of cackling out loud. The characters all interact by flirting or bickering, usually with women expressing disdain for the men. Jordan devotes a great deal of attention to the jewelry and clothing of the characters, even devoting a paragraph to a piece of Moraine's jewelry.<br /><br />The characters are more like a collection of tics and personality flaws than actual people -- Rand spends all his time worrying, but breaks out long enough to be a hero. Nynaeve and Egwene pull their hair and snipe, while Perrin feels inferior and Mat flirts. Of all the characters, Moraine is the only one who comes across as a person, especially since she keeps most of her plans to herself.<br /><br />\\"The Great Hunt\\" is one of those fantasy books that could have been quite good if about three hundred pages had been whittled out of it. As for \\"The Hunt Begins: The Great Hunt, Part 1,\\" it's half of a bloated fantasy sprawl.second-rate pulp writer.

And Margaret Moser obviously has worshipful tendencies in \\"Movie Stars Do The Dumbest Things.\\" From embarrassing anecdotes to idiotic lines (\\"My butt fascinates me\\"), she chronicles quite a few moments that some major stars would love to forget.<br /><br />Woody Allen's bizarre psychological quirks (and marriage to his stepdaughter). Sean Penn's bad behavior. And Jane Fonda informing the world that the Vietnam War was only because the US wanted Vietnam's \\"tung and tinsten,\\" which do not technically exist. Sure, everyone does incredibly stupid things, but a celebrity blunder is forever.<br /><br />And Moser does do a good job of collecting various embarrassing tantrums, hypocrises, demands, sexual indescretions (Peter Lawford's \\"Acujack\\") and airheaded remarks (Hugh Grant once said that then-lover Elizabeth Hurley was like his sister, because \\"incest is quite titillating\\"). She also devotes a section to young actors , and section devoted to dumb things directors do -- for example, all of Oliver Stone's anecdotes involve drugs.<br /><br />That isn't to say that it's perfect -- eating disorders and the tragic Judy Garland's suicide attempts are not \\"dumb things,\\" for example. And Sophia Loren being mobbed when she bought bras really wasn't her fault. While Moser's irreverent tone is what makes the book so funny, the book does need to find the fine line of sensitivity. (That, and what's with the topless pictures?)<br /><br />However, there are far more entertaining anecdotes than there are duds, and no one is safe from Moser's razor. Classic actors like Jean Harlow, Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean and Elvis Presley are given the same treatment as Pamela Anderson, Demi Moore and Eddie Murphy. And that lack of favoritism makes it even more amusing.<br /><br />For a few laughs at the expense of the sometimes-inexplicably famous, this is a good (sometimes flawed) light read.

The \\"Bible\\" of Middle-Earth, the \\"Silmarillion\\" stretches from the beginning of time to the departure of the Elves from Middle-Earth.<br /><br />A complete summary is impossible, because the book spans millennia and has one earth-shattering event after another. But it includes the creation of Tolkien's invented pantheons of angelic beings under Eru Iluvatar, also known as God; how they sang the world into being; the creation of Elves, Men, and Dwarves (hobbits are, I think, not really covered); the legendary love story of Beren and Luthien, a mortal Man and an Elf maiden who gives up her immortality for the man she loves; the demonic Morgoth and Sauron; Elves of just about any kind -- bad, mad, dangerous, good, sweet, brave, and so forth; the creation of the many Rings of Power -- and the One Ring of Sauron; the Two Trees that made the sun and moon; and finally the quest of the Ringbearer, Frodo Baggins.<br /><br />Many old favorites will pop up over the course of the book, such as Elrond, Galadriel, Gandalf, and so on. Fans of Elves will find plenty to feed their hunger; fans of Hobbits or Dwarves will not find as much here. It will also answer some questions that \\"Hobbit\\" and LOTR may raise, when references to long-ago incidents and people are made -- what is Numenor? Who are the Valar? This includes those things, and much more.<br /><br />The writing style of Silmarillion is more akin to the Eddas, the Bible, or the Mabinogian than to \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It's more formal and archaic in tone; Tolkien did not get as \\"into\\" the heads of his characters in Silmarillion as he did in LOTR, and there is no central character. Needless to say, this is necessary as a more in-depth approach would have taken centuries to write, let alone perfect. If readers can bypass the automatic dislike of more formal prose, they will find enchanting stories and a less evocative but very intriguing writing style. This style strongly leans on the Eddas, collections of story and song that were unearthed and translated long ago. Though obviously not as well-known as LOTR, it is clear that these collections helped influence the Silmarillion.<br /><br />It's clear to see, while reading this, the extent of Tolkien's passion for his invented history. Someone who had a lack of enthusiasm could not have spent much of his adult life writing, revising, and polishing a history that never was. It's also almost frighteningly imaginative and real: It isn't too hard to imagine that these things could actually have happened. In a genre clogged with shallow sword'n'sorcery, Tolkien's coherent, carefully-written backstory is truly unique.<br /><br />If you can take the formal prose and mythical style, this is a treasure, and a must-read for anyone who loved LOTR or \\"Hobbit.\\" Only after reading \\"The Silmarillion\\" can readers truly appreciate Tolkien's literary accomplishments, and the full scope of the Middle-Earth that is glimpsed in his more famous books.es and a less evocative but very intriguing writing style.

In particular, it focuses on a virtuous young Roman man, Glaucus, who is stuck in a love quadrangle with a beautiful, equally virtuous young lady, a blind slave girl, and a sinister Egyptian who beguiles the virtuous young lady.<br /><br />In the background is a turmoil of religious and social problems, with a deadly volcano smoldering behind it all. Then, a murder is committed -- and Glaucus is arrested for the crime, and sentenced to be sent into the arena. When Vesuvius blows, will any of them survive?<br /><br />\\"The Last Days of Pompeii\\" is one of those novels that had immense promise. Unfortunately, Bulwer-Lytton turns it into a Roman soap opera. Rather than focusing on the more interesting aspects of Pompeii, Bulwer-Lytton decided to focus on a contrived web of very boring people.<br /><br />It doesn't help that \\"Last Days of Pompeii\\" is also written in a chokingly dense style, very ornate and full of bad poetry. The dialogue is even worse, with lines like, \\"'With all his conceit and extravagance he is not so rich, I fancy, as he affects to be, and perhaps loves to save his amphorae better than his wit.\\" Okay, whatever. The story might be more palatable, had Bulwer-Lytton not tried too hard.<br /><br />Bulwer-Lytton also seems to have been showing off his knowledge of Roman architecture and clothing, since the descriptions of the atrium and triclinium are more complex than any character. He regularly interrupted the narrative just to lecture readers on historical trivia, on everything from medieval necromancy to Italian herbs.<br /><br />Apparently in the interest of keeping the novel \\"human,\\" Bulwer-Lytton introduced some romantic tension. Unfortunately, his characters don't act like real people -- really, who would fuss about their love lives while escaping from an erupting volcano? It's hard to imagine anyone so oblivious and self-absorbed, but the annoying blind slave Nydia apparently can't think of anything else.<br /><br />Glaucus is a paragon of virtue, despite what Romans of the time were like; he even converts to Christianity for no apparent reason, in keeping with the attempt to make him fit the Victorian ideal. On the flipside, Arbaces is a rather cartoonish -- even slightly racist -- villain, who is just there to make trouble because he wants to.<br /><br />\\"The Last Days of Pompeii\\" is an intriguing idea for a novel, but a flop as Edward Bulwer-Lytton actually wrote it.

It's an entertaining light read, written in a brisk fashion with some interesting character conflicts, but the lead character never develops any spark of life.<br /><br />They were all pals at college: glamourous Portia, mousy Cath, lovable gay Simon, and low-key Simon (whom Portia seduced to keep him \\"in her thrall\\"). Except for Portia, they have all stayed friends. But now Cath has been burned by a bad relationship and shies away from men. Josh is married to everywoman Lucy and has a hellspawn child and an icy nanny. And Si is desperately seeking his soulmate, only to ensnare himself with a vicious philanderer.<br /><br />Reenter Portia, more glamourous and beautiful than ever, and a successful TV producer... of a soap that closely mirrors her pals' lives. An elaborate dance of suspicion begins, as Cath and Simon believe that Lucy and Sim's marriage hits a rough spot, and that Simon is straying back to Portia. When Si is diagnosed with HIV, friendships are strained and secrets come unravelled -- with surprising results.<br /><br />There's nothing new or unexpected about \\"Bookends,\\" except for a throwaway subplot that Green tacks in late in the book. Perhaps the most intriguing thing is Portia's true nature -- is she a heartless manipulator? A glamorous slut? A sweet woman with devilish allure? Green keeps you guessing right up to the end.<br /><br />Her writing is pretty snappy and quick, and she weaves the subplots together without a lot of fuss or plot holes. Cath's sort-of-romance is underdeveloped, though, the identity of Portia's lover is obvious, and the HIV story feels contrived. But it is pretty entertaining to watch what is essentially a small-scale soap opera unfold, complete with marital strife, unfaithful lovers, bratty kids, sexy nannies and a Dark Exotic Mystery Woman.<br /><br />The one flaw in an otherwise good cast is Cath herself -- she's too timid and annoying to be likable. Si is an excellent character though, and adds extra depth and poignancy to the cliched lovable gay pal. His struggles and longing for true love make you want to hug him. Josh and Lucy are good as the ideal marrieds who hit a rough patch.<br /><br />An almost-perfect cast redeems a by-the-numbers novel about friendship and relationships.

Now with the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It has quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it, set the tone for most fantasy ever since, topped many \\"best book\\" polls, and helped spawn such entertainment phenomena as \\"Star Wars.\\"<br /><br />Following up on events in \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" stars the quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.<br /><br />\\"The Two Towers\\" begins directly after \\"Fellowship,\\" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them. His cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs from the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.<br /><br />\\"Return of the King\\" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.<br /><br />\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.<br /><br />Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual. Merry and Pippin start out a bit flaky, but are matured by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue ranges from goofy and hilarious to solemn and archaic, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary; if you don't have a good attention span, then you won't be able to handle this story. If you do, then probably you can.<br /><br />Even after all the years, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" stillrules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and few books have even come close to equalling it.rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature.

Books	4	15	15	N	N	Kept in perspective	Perhaps the biggest controversy among J.R.R. Tolkien's fans is: Are Peter Jackson's films masterpieces, or travesties? Greg Wright tackles this question in his second book on Tolkien and Middle-Earth, \\"Peter Jackson In Perspective: The Power Behind Cinema's 'The Lord of the Rings.'\\" And Wright handles it with remarkable objectivity and grace.<br /><br />Wright starts with an examination of novels vs. movies -- after all, the flow and content of each is completely different -- and the disastrous past attempts to film \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" He even tells the story of his first viewing of Ralph Bakshi's infamous rotoscoped cartoon.<br /><br />He then takes a hard look at what Jackson cut out, what characters are MIA (Tom Bombadil, for good or ill), whether it helps or hurts the story, the presence of love and romance, the way that Jackson filmed the three stories, and compares Jackson's efforts to the Rankin-Bass cartoons. I give you three guesses which Wright declares to be better, and the first two don't count.<br /><br />And as in his first book \\"Tolkien in Perspective: Sifting the Gold From the Glitter,\\" Wright gives his analysis a faith bent. For example, when talking about Gandalf's fall into Khazad-dum, he reflects that many have noticed the crucifix-lookalike pose that Gandalf falls in.<br /><br />Wright doesn't overburden his narrative with rambling or ponderous opinions. Instead he writes like an intelligent pal who's telling you his thoughts on the movies he's seen recently.

While there's quite a few pretty descriptions and interesting new ideas, Elizabeth Haydon's series ends up flopping like a morbid fish.<br /><br />\\"Rhapsody\\" introduces us to a potentially interesting heroine and world -- Rhapsody is an ex-prostitute bard who is also a Singer, able to change reality by her voice. After a run-in with a former \\"client's\\" henchmen, she ends up with a hired assassin and his ogre-ish sidekick -- and then goes through \\"The Root,\\" in a life-changing trip through time.<br /><br />\\"Prophecy: Child of Earth\\" continued the story as Rhapsody and Co. battle a demon, gain new powers, and battle the future Battle That Will Either Save Or End The World. Okay, whatever. In the finale of the trilogy, \\"Destiny: Child of the Sky,\\" the group is battling the evil F'Dor, and Rhapsody learns the secrets of her past and what might destroy her love.<br /><br />Here's a tip for all wannabe authors: No matter how much you want us to like your hero(ine), don't make him/her perfect. Apparently Elizabeth Haydon never got that tip. Her excruciating heroine makes the angels look positively selfish -- and it's enough to make you sick. Too bad Haydon didn't focus the series on creepy assassin Achmed or part-dragon Ashe -- either one would make a more interesting lead than Rhapsody.<br /><br />Haydon does redeem her book somewhat with her writing, which makes good use of language and has quite a few prettily written passages. She also conjures up some truly intriguing ideas, such as Rhapsody's singing ability and the Root. But in other areas, her writing has the feeling of a kiddie fantasy cartoon -- a magic sword called \\"Daystar Clarion\\"? Come on.<br /><br />Rhapsody is the biggest problem: ridiculously sweet, annoyingly clueless, and inspires all other characters to follow her like so many lovestruck sheep, or quiver after her. She even has her virginity magically restored, and doesn't realize that her goddesslike beauty practically causes men to wet themselves. Even dragons get the hots for her. Who can like a character like that? She reads like the private fantasy of an author who desperately needed to get this out of her system.<br /><br />\\"The Symphony of Ages\\" had promise at the start, but a grotesquely saccharine heroine and her army of lust-addled followers kill that promise.

Now with the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It has quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it, set the tone for most fantasy ever since, topped many \\"best book\\" polls, and helped spawn such entertainment phenomena as \\"Star Wars.\\"<br /><br />Following up on events in \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" stars the quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.<br /><br />\\"The Two Towers\\" begins directly after \\"Fellowship,\\" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them. His cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs from the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.<br /><br />\\"Return of the King\\" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.<br /><br />\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.<br /><br />Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual. Merry and Pippin start out a bit flaky, but are matured by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue ranges from goofy and hilarious to solemn and archaic, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary; if you don't have a good attention span, then you won't be able to handle this story. If you do, then probably you can.<br /><br />Even after all the years, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" stillrules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and few books have even come close to equalling it.rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature.

With its likeable heroine and delightful plot, this is one that bibliophiles will drool over. It's sort of as if Terry Pratchett wrote mysteries.<br /><br />It takes place an alternate world where the Crimean War has lasted over a century, vampirism and lycanthropy are like diseases, time can be warped, and people can fall in and out of books and plays -- and if it's the original work, it will change all the other copies. Thursday Next is an agent for a special division devoted to literature, and is on the trail of the villainous Acheron Hades after the theft of the manuscript of \\"Martin Chuzzlewit\\" by Charles Dickens. To complicate matters more, her old boyfriend Landen has reentered the picture, and the obnoxious Schitt of the powerful Goliath Corporation is following Thursday.<br /><br />Hades seems to have been killed, but Thursday is almost sure that he isn't. It turns out she's right -- he kidnaps her aunt and \\"mad as pants\\" uncle Mycroft Next, who has just made a machine that allows people to wander into pieces of literature. Hades's plot is to use the machine to disrupt literature as we know it. First he kills a minor character from \\"Martin Chuzzlewit,\\" and then kidnaps Jane Eyre (in this parallel universe, the novel has a very different ending). Thursday Next teams up with the brooding Rochester and an odd bunch of characters to save Jane -- and all the other great works of literature.<br /><br />This is one of the best-conceived and best-executed ideas in recent years. A lot of readers probably won't understand all of the literary jokes and in-jokes (it sounds snobby, I know, but if you don't get something then just skip it), as well as some that anybody can understand (like the invention of the banana). The idea of high art as pop culture is delightfully done, like the guy with the \\"Hand of God\\" tattoo, or the door-to-door Baconian missionaries, or a John Milton convention. Take a sprinkling of real-life pop culture, make it art-inclined, and that's what you get.<br /><br />One of the best things about this book is that it overflows with promise for sequels in this universe. Time travel, a chilling scene with a lisping vampire, lycanthropy, and the wealth of literature are all dealt with, but not so thoroughly that it can't be used again. The writing style is spare and fast-moving, sort of like Terry Pratchett's but more detailed. The dialogue is very good, with a lot of good quotables.<br /><br />Thursday Next is a likable female lead, very hard-boiled, tough and smart, but with a vulnerable side. Uncle Mycroft is just delightful, mad as pants! Acheron Hades is one of those villains who loves evil for its own sake (well, with a name like \\"Hades,\\" what can you expect?), and people who like a complex reason for a person to be bad won't like him. I thought he was fantastic, especially the line \\"I'm just... well, differently moralled, that's all.\\" And Thursday's dad steals every scene he's in, as the casual time traveller who's always setting things right in history, and stops time when he appears (\\"My father had a face that could stop a clock\\"). And who couldn't love Pickwick the dodo?<br /><br />Jasper Fforde's first novel is a slightly frothy, book-hopping, tongue-in-cheek novel.

Odd things are MEANT to happen.\\" That remark, coming from galactic tyrant Emperor Zhark, sets the tone for Jasper Fforde's fourth book in the still-fresh Thursday Next series, \\"Something Rotten.\\" Funny, literate, and sometimes quite poignant, this proves that Fforde still has the spark.<br /><br />After a disastrous incident in the Wild West, Thursday Next decides to leave Jurisfiction, and goes home with her two-year-old son Friday. But things aren't more peaceful in the real world: The Goliath Corporation has become a religion, there's a politician named Yorrick Kaine blaming the Danes for everything, and a croquet match is set to determine the fate of the world. If they win, the Goliath Corporation (and Kaine) are finished. If they lose, the world has a 22% chance of Armageddon.<br /><br />Thursday's personal life is no easier. Her husband has been \\"eradicated,\\" and her mom's house is full of guests from Hamlet to a 13th-century seer. Now her only hope lies in somehow getting the Goliath Corporation to give her husband back, and in winning the cricket match (with the help of Hamlet and a bunch of Neanderthals). But Kaine and the Corporation aren't about to go down without a fight... and they might take Thursday down with them.<br /><br />Jasper Fforde won readers' hearts with the comedy/mystery/fantasy/satire \\"The Eyre Affair,\\" and kept winning them with the two sequels. Though \\"Well of Lost Books\\" was a bit shaky, \\"Rotten\\" gets its footing quickly. Any book that has Ophelia staging a coup and taking over the play must be a winner. But Fforde also wraps up some threads from the earlier books, such as Landen's eradication. The question of Thursday's punishment (for changing the end of \\"Jane Eyre\\") is also dealt with, in a poignant and unexpected twist.<br /><br />Fforde seems more comfortable than ever in his literate-spoof world. His writing is assured and detailed, with a few dizzy puns and plenty of English-major humor, like Hamlet being a Mel Gibson fan. He wraps dozens of seemingly random threads together, tying them off neatly at the end. The climactic fight between Thursday and Kaine is both funny and brilliant, as they set one literary creation against another, including Beowulf and the Jabberwock.<br /><br />The smart, tough-yet-loving Thursday is joined by a bunch of characters both lovable and infuriating, including her Latin-spouting tot Friday and a bunch of Neanderthals. Gran Next has a secret identity revealed, and Landen returns... spasmodically, on and off. Most winning are the exuberant Hamlet and Thursday's brother, the Irreverend Joffy. Oddly enough, the villains -- such as Mr. Goliath and hit woman Cindy -- tend to be two-dimensional, but fictional ones (like Emperor Zhark) are enormous fun. Oh, the irony.<br /><br />Jasper Fforde returns with \\"Something Rotten,\\" a solid entry in the ongoing fantasy-detective series.

And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.<br /><br />Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).<br /><br />So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.<br /><br />Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" --  especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.<br /><br />The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter -- each is given his own quirks and strengths.<br /><br />With the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie trilogy solidly entrenched in pop culture, J.R.R.

Not only did Serkis get the role, he also learned that there was more needed for Gollum than just the voice: He had to suit up in a motion capture suit to provide Gollum's movements as well.<br /><br />\\"Gollum: A Behind the Scenes Guide\\" is more than just a guide about how the first really convincing CGI character was created. Serkis also chronicles bits of his everyday life in New Zealand, the birth of his son, September 11th, the premiere of \\"Two Towers,\\" and the more widespread reaction to everybody's favorite Ring junkie (Gollum appeared on SNL and \\"The Simpsons, for example). Not to mention a sweet poem Serkis wrote to his young daughter.<br /><br />To give further dimension to Serkis's story, there are lots of concept drawings and clay statues of Gollum (warning: avoid certain pages unless you're willing to see Gollum naked). There are also detailed sections written by Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, the mocap crew, and many others about how they also helped create Gollum. For example, there was a lot of thought given to what kind of nose Gollum should have, or whether he should have a potbelly.<br /><br />Serkis has a nice, conversational style, with plenty of self-deprecating humor and excellent descriptions (\\"... suddenly this bald lunatic in pale green spandex comes lolloping into view.

Because it's not. Alan Garner skillfully weaves Welsh mythology with a suspenseful, almost horrifying story about ancient power reaching to the modern day.<br /><br />Something is scratching through Alison's ceiling, when she is sick with a stomachache. She and the cook's son Gwyn venture up into the loft, and there find a heap of strangely patterned plates. At first glance, the pattern appears to be an abstract floral; upon closer examination, Alison finds that when she traces around the pattern on pieces of paper, that they form tiny paper owls. Alison's brother Roger is inclined to be dismissive, but Gwyn isn't so sure.<br /><br />For some reason, discovery sends Gwyn's mother into a near-crazed frenzy, and attracts the attention of the old handyman, Huw. Huw tells Gwyn a tragic old story -- one that is connected to Alison's strange behavior. When their mothers forbid them to speak to one another, Huw reveals his true nature. To save Alison from repeating the cycle, Gwyn learns that he must discover things about his own past...<br /><br />Like the previous two children's books by Alan Garner, this is about modern-day children swept up in mythical forces, but while the creatures and people of \\"Weirdstone\\" and \\"Moon\\" were solid and easily-defined, here everything is misted and ghostly. So much so that the climax, while exquisitely written, is very hard to decipher, and which will leave readers feeling deeply unsatisfied. Just what happened?<br /><br />Garner takes a relatively obscure myth and spins up a strange tale around it. The writing matches that. Garner's is an exquisitely atmospheric style: the scenes of magic are otherworldly, as is any scene where Alison cuts out the owls, which becomes more sinister as the reason why becomes clear. There are a few scenes where the atmosphere is wholly human, such as the scene where Gwyn's mother leaves him win the rain without caring what happens to him.<br /><br />Gwyn is our Charlie Brown hero -- he's the boy next door, an ordinary kid with an embittered mother. Alison's personality is a little less defined, since she spends the story being possessed by the magic. We don't get to see much of the real Alison. And it's not clear Roger is in the story, since he contributes nothing except a series of obnoxious comments and insinuations. Huw is clearly a mystery from the beginning, that is slowly unravelled to reveal his tragic ancestry and past.<br /><br />While flawed by some useless characters, \\"The Owl Service\\" is a beautifully written book.

But things suddenly get worse when the ogre/alien Oni invade, and offer the Earth a deal: if Ataru can defeat their champion in the game of tag, a sexy Oni called Lum, then they will withdraw. Ataru fails at first -- until girlfriend Shinobu offers to marry him if he wins. The next day, Ataru tags Lum and shouts out that now he can get married... but Lum interprets it as a proposal, and declares herself his \\"wife.\\"<br /><br />With Shinobu furious at him, and a very ugly priest trailing him, Ataru has plenty of problems.

It's less like a continuing story than a series of sitcom episodes.<br /><br />Takahashi's wacky sense of humor is in full swing here, starting out with the idea of a traditional Japanese ogre as a sexy alien in a tigerskin bikini. There appear to be no comic depths to which she will not sink (or rise) -- physical comedy, word puns, and over-the-top lechery that causes Ataru to pursue anything in a skirt (even when his mind is that of a woman).<br /><br />Ataru and Lum don't get on as well as they do later in the series -- Ataru, for some reason, is annoyed by a pretty girl who's utterly devoted to him, and Lum hasn't yet shown any real affection for him.

All the boys at Tomobiki High (EXCEPT the lecherous Ataru) are desperate to be \\"treated\\" by her -- until demonically possessed germs strike the school. Later, Sakura has to deal with an estrange umbrella and stormcloud, Ataru acccidentally gets xeroxed, and the not-so-fearsome school spook has a dance with Lum.<br /><br />Then it's off to the seashore, at Shutaro Mendo's beachhouse. Freakoid monk Cherry makes a reappearance, and teaches Mendo and Ataru about the purifying influence of surfing. (I kid you not) Then the gang hunts a swimsuit thief (who may or may not be Cherry), does some unconventional yoga, and engages in a monstrous eating contest.<br /><br />\\"The Return of Lum: Urusei Yatsura\\" is a bit different from Takahashi's later work -- it's not action based, or romance based, or any mix of the two.

Sakura comes across as the most mature and intelligent person here, despite her sickening lack of weight gain. Ataru and Lum get a bit more laid-back by the sea -- their relationship really doesn't progress at all -- while the arrogant Mendo encounters an old baseball-playing rival who still wants to settle the score.<br /><br />Alien princesses, teen lechers and surfing priests... on summer vacation.

The king's wise men are cheating him, and a young scholar named Lucian innocently uncovers it. He flees the palace before he can be disposed of, on a donkey that suddenly talks to him. (The donkey, by the way, is actually a poet who drank from a magical spring)<br /><br />Before long, the two meet up with a sharp-witted, slightly magical girl named Joy-in-the-Dance, who bails Fronto and Lucian out of a sticky situation. Soon they are joined by a perky little goat-boy and a former king, who is now a scapegoat (the villagers use him for blame). All together they set off for the Lady of Wild Things, and the fulfillment of a prophecy.<br /><br />Lloyd Alexander knows his character strengths, and many of the characters in in his lesser-known books resemble those in the Prydain Chronicles. But he keeps the well-worn quest plot feeling fresh. In short, people who enjoyed his prior fantasy quests will probably enjoy \\"The Arkadians.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps the main problem with the story is that it would fill a much skinnier book if Alexander hadn't padded it with countless Greek legends, such as the tale of the Minotaur. However, he keeps the plot going at a quick, pleasant pace, with entertainingly quirky dialogue and rather sparse descriptions.<br /><br />He also adds plenty of fantastical detail wherever it's needed. The respective cultures of the people in Arkadia, the more militant Bear Tribe and the more festive people of the Lady, are well-drawn and believable in their differences. The romance between Lucian and Joy-in-the-Dance seems a bit too sudden, although it's not hard to see why they fell in love.<br /><br />\\"The Arkadians\\" keeps Lloyd Alexander's track record of amusing, offbeat fantasy adventures.

And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.<br /><br />Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).<br /><br />So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.<br /><br />Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.<br /><br />The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure.

Because it's not. Alan Garner skillfully weaves Welsh mythology with a suspenseful, almost horrifying story about ancient power reaching to the modern day.<br /><br />Something is scratching through Alison's ceiling, when she is sick with a stomachache. She and the cook's son Gwyn venture up into the loft, and there find a heap of strangely patterned plates. At first glance, the pattern appears to be an abstract floral; upon closer examination, Alison finds that when she traces around the pattern on pieces of paper, that they form tiny paper owls. Alison's brother Roger is inclined to be dismissive, but Gwyn isn't so sure.<br /><br />For some reason, discovery sends Gwyn's mother into a near-crazed frenzy, and attracts the attention of the old handyman, Huw. Huw tells Gwyn a tragic old story -- one that is connected to Alison's strange behavior. When their mothers forbid them to speak to one another, Huw reveals his true nature. To save Alison from repeating the cycle, Gwyn learns that he must discover things about his own past...<br /><br />Like the previous two children's books by Alan Garner, this is about modern-day children swept up in mythical forces, but while the creatures and people of \\"Weirdstone\\" and \\"Moon\\" were solid and easily-defined, here everything is misted and ghostly. So much so that the climax, while exquisitely written, is very hard to decipher, and which will leave readers feeling deeply unsatisfied. Just what happened?<br /><br />Garner takes a relatively obscure myth and spins up a strange tale around it. The writing matches that. Garner's is an exquisitely atmospheric style: the scenes of magic are otherworldly, as is any scene where Alison cuts out the owls, which becomes more sinister as the reason why becomes clear. There are a few scenes where the atmosphere is wholly human, such as the scene where Gwyn's mother leaves him win the rain without caring what happens to him.<br /><br />Gwyn is our Charlie Brown hero -- he's the boy next door, an ordinary kid with an embittered mother. Alison's personality is a little less defined, since she spends the story being possessed by the magic. We don't get to see much of the real Alison. And it's not clear Roger is in the story, since he contributes nothing except a series of obnoxious comments and insinuations. Huw is clearly a mystery from the beginning, that is slowly unravelled to reveal his tragic ancestry and past.<br /><br />While flawed by some useless characters, \\"The Owl Service\\" is a beautifully written book. If only Garner had thought up a climax to match the exquisite buildup.the rain without caring what happens to him.  <br /> <br />Gwyn is our Charlie Brown hero -- he's the boy next door, an ordinary kid with an embittered mother.

Like the book before it, \\"The Moon of Gomrath\\" takes the ingredients of stereotypical fantasy, and gives them a slight twist. The result is a moonlit, mythical adventure with a rare power.<br /><br />While walking in the woods, Colin and Susan encounter an elf and a dwarf, near where Cadellin the wizard guards the sleeping knights. They learn that the lios-alfar (elves) are migrating to Alderly, because a mysterious force is causing some of them to vanish. Unfortunately, proximity to humans' pollution is causing the \\"smoke sickness\\" in the elves, and Uthecar asks that Susan lend him the bracelet that Angharad Goldenhand gave her.<br /><br />But Susan is suddenly kidnapped by an evil force, and reappears quiet and strange. She has been taken over by the malevolent Brollachan. The dwarves and Cadellin are able to help Colin restore her to normality -- but evil is still stirring in the form of the Morrigan and her sinister cohorts. And when Susan and Colin light a fire to keep warm on a hill, they inadvertantly set off the band of magical horsemen, the Wild Hunt...<br /><br />\\"The Moon of Gomrath\\" is less like a real sequel, and more like \\"Part Two\\" of prior novel \\"The Weirdstone of Brisingamen,\\" with the same mythical storylines and quiet poetry of Garner's unique style. But this time around, warring wizards and goblins take a backseat to elves and ancient warriors straight out of old Celtic myth.<br /><br />Garner's writing remains poignant and rather saddening -- the elves are sickening, Susan is forever changed by the golden bracelet and her possession, and the industrial world is slowly driving away past magic. Garner tells us that someone who uses a magical horn \\"may not know peace again, not in the sun's circle or in the darkling of the world.\\"<br /><br />Susan and Colin fulfil the archetype of plucky-British-kids-on-magical-vacation quite well. Although Susan slowly transcends that over the course of the book, Colin doesn't change much. Cadellin doesn't appear much, but his absence is made up for by the lios-alfar, an evil dwarf, and the malevolent witch Morrigan.<br /><br />The mythical beauty of \\"The Moon of Gomrath\\" is only really comparable to \\"The Weirdstone of Brisingamen,\\" its predecessor. Magical, mythical, and thoroughly entrancing.wly transcends that over the course of the book, Colin doesn't change much.

Later, Lum finds that either Mendo or Ataru may be her soulmate, according to astrology, and disguises herself as a human girl to gauge Ataru's liking for her.<br /><br />Ataru receives mysterious love letters, unaware that his pals are playing a prank on him -- until Lum comes to the rescue, realizing that she actually loves him. A flurry of other stories involve Ataru trying to protect a giant caterpillar, studying in a cursed classroom, and Mendo desperately trying to hide an alien baby. Then Lum suddenly vanishes without warning -- has Ataru lost her forever? And will he start to realize that he really cares?<br /><br />\\"The Return of Lum: Urusei Yatsura\\" is a bit different from Takahashi's later work -- it's not action based, or romance based, or any mix of the two.

Not to mention Takahashi's interlocking love triangles, with rivals for Lum's affection and plenty of repressed feelings.<br /><br />While Ataru comes across as a dorky lecher throughout most of the book, Takahashi also shows his more sensitive sides in this story, especially when Lum mysteriously vanishes -- Ataru indulges in a very wet, snivelly crying fit. He also plays daddy to a repulsive caterpillar, because he believes it will be beautiful.

But their conversation is cut short when a gas leak causes a massive explosion -- and Suzuko wakes up hundreds of years in the past, in a Japan torn by bandits and wars. She encounters brash young warriors Shukumaru, who is definitely interested in her.<br /><br />While Suzuko and Shukumaru go through an awkward courtship, Suzuko struggles to figure out what happened to her, and how she can get back. But when an invading army attacks the small village, Suzuko and Shukumaru end up being shot through time again -- and Suzuko learns the shocking truth in her own past, and where Shukumaru is really from.<br /><br />\\"Fire Tripper\\" is one of the best short stories that Takahashi has done, and it balances out action, romance, and a bit of mystery. Not to mention tried-and-true comedy in the Takahashi tradition. The twist at the end is surprisingly original, and it wraps up all the loose ends while giving a satisfactory finale to the romantic subplot.<br /><br />Despite a scene where Shukumaru staggers in and drunkenly announces that he's going to sleep with Suzuko, he's a likably brash guy, a bit crude but essentially good-hearted. His final line is a great one. Suzuko is a bit bland until near the end, where she realizes where in time she actually comes from, and makes her decision about Shukamaru.<br /><br />\\"Fire Tripper\\" is a sort of warm-up to the action/romance/fantasy of \\"Inuyasha,\\" with similar leads, but it's also an excellent short story on its own merits.

Amy Lowell was one of the most vibrant Imagist poets, and her command of language was what made her \\"new\\" type of poetry pop to life. Don't expect that here. \\"A Dome of Many Colored Glass\\" was her first collection, displaying all kinds of more traditional poetry -- sonnets, lyrical poems and children's ditties.<br /><br />Each type of poem has its own section. The first section is for lyrical poetry: songlike poems about Venetian glass, passionate prayer, birds and mythical golden apples. At times the rhyming gets a bit strained (\\"Orbed, and glittering, and pendent... Not one missing, still transcendent\\"), but her rich wording and varied styles cover up many of the flaws (\\"The air was of rose and gold/ Arabesqued with the song of birds/Who, swinging unseen under leaves,/Made music more eager than words.\\")<br /><br />After the lyrical poems come the sonnets. In many sonnets, her style seems restricted by the strict limits of the sonnet. However, her rich style does peek out in poems like \\"Monadnock in Early Spring,\\" as well as quite a few poems that ponder life's meaning. And gardens, too. Lowell then includes an ode to \\"The Boston Athenaeum,\\" and winds it up with some simplistic children's poems (\\"Sea Shell, Sea Shell,/ Sing me a song, O Please!/A song of ships, and sailor men,/And parrots, and tropical trees.\\")<br /><br />Amy Lowell's verse has a kind of quiet grace to it -- she focuses a lot on nature, and very personal feelings. While her poetry was never fully recognized during her short lifetime, it has gained more notice over time. This is partly due to Lowell's status as a woman poet, but more because of the quality of her verse.<br /><br />Her poetry is also deeply evocative. Like Wallace Stevens, Lowell used words to paint vivid portraits, including color and texture (\\"Sodden and spongy\\"). Often the images she conjures are a bit fantastical, which only adds to the appeal of her poetry (\\"The stars hang thick in the apple tree\\"; \\"The air was of rose and gold\\"). Her tone tends to be a bit formal, sprinkled with \\"thous\\" and \\"thees\\" every now and then.<br /><br />\\"Dome of Many-Colored Glass\\" does tend to be much more sentimental and conventional than Lowell's later work, which is its sole weakness -- it wasn't all that Lowell could have made it. Since it was her first book, Lowell hadn't yet graduated to the sharper, brighter \\"Sword Blades and Poppy Seed\\" which was published two years later. But taken on its own \\"Dome\\" is still quite beautiful.<br /><br />While \\"Dome of Many Colored Glass\\" was not the best of Lowell's poetry collections, it's still vibrant and quite lovely, if you get past some very strained rhymes and slightly soppy subject matternd gold\\").

And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on.

And the final poem of the collection seems sad when one considers that she committed suicide: \\"I will make this world of my devising/out of a dream in my lonely mind/I shall find the crystal of peace,-- above me/stars I shall find.\\"<br /><br />Teasdale never actually had a successful romance in her life, but she was obviously in love with love. \\"When I am not with you/I am alone/for there is no one else/and there is nothing/that comforts me but you,\\" she writes late in the volume. Imagine having that written to you, or at least given to illustrate the feelings.<br /><br />Almost every poem in the eight books deals with romance, lovers, and how much she adored both. In fact, after awhile it gets a little tedious; it's a good idea to read it slowly, in chunks. However, Teasdale's love poetry is extremely beautiful and richly written, so that it's hard not to get dewy-eyed when reading them individually.<br /><br />\\"The Collected Poems of Sara Teasdale\\" is a rich read, beautifully written and full of flowers, stars, dark rooms and unnamed lovers. A beautifully romantic read, though too intense to be read in one setting.e to be read in one setting.	2005-01-11

Soon he teams up with a wandering king-minstrel, a sharp-tongued princess and a furry creature called Gurgi to save Prydain from the power of the Horned King.<br /><br />\\"The Black Cauldron\\" has Taran and the others setting out to destroy Arawn Deathlord's evil cauldron, which turns dead men into unkillable zombies. But other forces are after the cauldron, including three peculiar witches who insist on trading something for the cauldron. What is worse, the company faces treachery from someone in their own camp...<br /><br />\\"The Castle of Llyr\\" ties up some loose ends from the first book, as Princess Eilonwy is sent to the isle of Mona to become a fine lady. But she has barely arrived when she is kidnapped by a minion of the evil enchantress Achren, her \\"aunt.\\" Taran sets out to save her, but must team up with the young man who wishes to marry Eilonwy -- even though Taran is rapidly falling in love with her.<br /><br />\\"Taran Wanderer\\" has Taran setting out to discover his past, since he feels he can't ask Eilonwy to marry him if he is lowborn. With only Gurgi at his side, he encounters evil wizards, malevolent bandits, and finally learns that his father just might be a shepherd... until a new revelation leads him to learn of his true worth.<br /><br />\\"The High King\\" wraps up the saga, with Taran returning home. But no sooner has he arrived than he learns that noble Prince Gwydion has been half-killed -- and the magical sword Dyrnwyn has been stolen by Arawn Deathlord. Now the heroes set out one and for all to attack Arawn's stronghold and get back the sword -- but how can they defeat a deathless army and a shapeshifting enemy?<br /><br />Finally, \\"The Foundling\\" fills in a few of the gaps with short stories that illustrate the backstory of the Prydain novels. Among the stories are the tragic history of Dyrnwyn, how the wizard Dallben was reared by the three witches (and where he got the Book of Three), and the love story of Eilonwy's parents.<br /><br />Take two parts \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" add a bit more humor and comedy, and stir in some Welsh mythology. That pretty much sums up the Prydain Chronicles, which is one of the rare series that is meant for kids, but is as rich an experience for adults.

Oh yeah, and that that Chinese curse about interesting times is quite correct.

And the flip-book \\"The Princess-in-Training Manual/Divas Don't Fake It\\" lives up to that. \\"Divas\\" is a passable piece of chick-lit, but \\"Manual\\" is an excruciatingly self-satisfied piece of garbage.<br /><br />Jacqueline de Soignee is the perfect princess -- self-confident, beautiful, wealthy, and universally adored. Oh yes, and of course she's also down-to-earth. Despite being royalty, she's just like every other girl. (Note to every-other-girls of the world: if you're not retching now, you should be). She offers tips on how to be a non-royal princess, as she navigates a web of fashion, displeased kings, sexy Frenchmen and slimy tabloid reporters.<br /><br />In contrast, Xandra Kingston is a diva with a capital D. She's passionate, confident, can curse out a man, and is the center of attention wherever she goes. Like Jacqueline, she offers quite a few tips on becoming a true diva, while navigating the problems of love, work and personal life. And occasionally a well-aimed thrown plate.<br /><br />There have always been self-assured women around, and this flip-book seems to be a celebration of such women. Unfortunately, Orloff seems unaware that it's no fun to read a personal fantasy that name-drops designers fast and furiously. There's nothing wrong with fantasizing about being a Paris-Hiltonesque princess, but keep it to yourself rather than inflicting a poorly-written story on the world.<br /><br />The two heroines could not be more different -- Xandra comes across as humorous and self-assured, without the neuroses that most chick-lit protagonists have. The scene where she roars at a male opponent is just wonderful. Jacqueline, on the other hand, just seems like a fantasy alter ego -- she's rich, beautiful, adored, and has the IQ of a salted peanut.<br /><br />The princess tips are vapid and pointless. The diva tips, on the other hand, are pretty solid, although they echo of women's self-help columns. And the storylines follow suit. Xandra's tale is fun and unself-conscious, while Jacqueline's starts with a director burbling that her presence -- a cameo where she steps out of a car -- will make his film a masterpiece. Gag.<br /><br />This two-pack is rancid on one side, but pretty amusing on the other.

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

The pre-Raphaelite movement was created to advance the styles of Renaissance Italy, and Rossetti was among the most successful. His writing style is on best display here, in all its forms.<br /><br />Clive Wilmer makes several good choices for the poems involved, showcasing all of the styles that Rossetti did best. Some are like songs, some are sonnets, and some simply straightforward rhyming poems. So the focus is on pure poetry that has aged the best, not on the style of the Victorian era.<br /><br />Rossetti's style is ornate and a bit old-sounding (\\"Thou seest the card that falls; -- she knows/The card that followeth\\"), and is overwhelmed with references to nature -- plants, wind, hills, diamonds and \\"smooth polish'd silent things.\\" And, of course, beautiful women with shadowy eyes and golden hair.<br /><br />Dante Gabriel Rossetti's poetry is well-chosen in Clive Wilmer's collection, and a good introduction to his writings. Lush, rich and lastingly beautiful.	2005-01-01

And in the eighth chapter of her romantic dramedy \\"Maison Ikkoku,\\" things get shaken up quite a bit, with the inclusion of a new character, an important talk, a near-breakup and a diamond ring.<br /><br />After a disastrous trip to a spa and more conflicts with Kyoko's obnoxious parents, Yusaku finds himself presented with a unique opportunity -- a chance to find out what Kyoko's mysterious late husband looked like. And Kyoko has a talk with her late husband at his gravesite, unaware that Yusaku is listening.  But then a new person enters the mix: Nozomu Nikaido, a wealthy teenager who has just entered college, and whose bubble-brained mom accidently sent him to the wrong apartment building.<br /><br />Like Yusaku, Nikaido immediately becomes a target for the crazier tenants: the dignified pervert Mr. Yotsuya, sexy waitress Akemi, and drunken housewife Mrs. Ichinose. But unlike Yusaku, he isn't going to take it lying down -- he's going to fight back. And when Nikaido encounters Yusaku's platonic girlfriend Kozue, he throws a few more monkey wrenches into the might-be relationship between Kyoko and Yusaku.<br /><br />With any series like \\"Maison Ikkoku,\\" there's always the chance of things getting stale. So in this volume, Takahashi gives us some new characters, complications, attractions and problems. And, fortunately, it gives this funny little comic drama a bit more of both.<br /><br />Takahashi doesn't take her gaze off the interlocking love triangles for long, although it is fun to see Yotsuya and Nikaido trying to one-up each other in the revenge game. And there's a new source of comedy as Nikaido naively sabotages poor Yusaku's love life, as Yusaku silently rages against the younger man's incredible denseness.<br /><br />Nikaido's a fun addition to the cast -- he's a weird mix of craftiness and naivete, trying to cut the apron strings from his rather annoying mom. Kyoko and Yusaku hit new snags in their possible relationship, as Kyoko remembers her late husband, and Yusaku tries to find a way to disentangle himself from Kozue without breaking her heart. His rival Shun Mitaka only makes a brief appearance, but it's a funny one -- which involves Yusaku giving Kyoko a diamond ring.<br /><br />New blood enters the mix in the eighth \\"Maison Ikkoku\\" volume, but things have more or less stayed the same. A fun and romantic read, with plenty more hijinks to come.hit new snags in their possible relationship, as Kyoko remembers her late husband, and Yusaku tries to find a way to disentangle himself from Kozue without breaking her heart.

It's almost chastely erotic, mysterious and dripping over with Victorian-era romance. It's hard not to be drawn in.<br /><br />A young scholar, Roland, stumbles accidently on an old letter from acclaimed poet Randolph Ash. He soon has reason to believe that the letter was to Christabel La Monte, a lesser-known \\"fairy\\" poet -- except Ash was happily married, and La Monte was single all her life. Roland and the chilly fellow scholar Maud investigate caches of hidden letters, poems, and diaries by the lovers, wife, friends and relatives.<br /><br />In the past, the cordial letters of Christabel and Randolph blossomed into love and passion. They vanished for a short, blissful time together. But what happened to Christabel and Randolph's love, and why did Christabel leave England, while her companion Blanche committed suicide? And how do these events somehow involve Roland and Maude's own growing attachment?<br /><br />They say the pen is mightier than the sword, and in \\"Possession\\" it's a valuable historical tool. When words are hidden or read, it can change perceptions and even lives. Byatt's own words are wonderfully lush, dreamy and vivid. Given the rather formal language and writing, it almost seems like a nineteenth-century novel, as if Byatt got so swept up in the characters that she started writing like them.<br /><br />Byatt has an excellent eye for the language of the era. The letters, poetry and fiction of Christabel and Randolph have a very authentic feel. Especially since Byatt manages to change tones for different people's writing (Christabel's  poetry was a bit reminiscent of Emily Dickenson's). The only problem is when the book veers into long tangents; Byatt seems to get a little off-track there. But most of the time, the richness of Breton legend adds depth and mystery to an already beautiful novel. The sunken city of Is, the legend of Melusina, and many others are here.<br /><br />Byatt gives us an amazing look at the ill-fated lovers, Christabel and Randolph; you can feel their passion and love. They aren't just attracted to each other, but drawn together in the mind and spirit. The supporting characters, such as the artist Blanche and devoted, wistful Ellen Ash, are equally well-drawn; you can't dislike any of them. Roland and Maud seem a little anemic by comparison, but they are still compelling characters, caught up in a love affair from over a hundred years ago.<br /><br />After taking the recommendation of a good friend, I found that \\"Possession\\" is the kind of genuine, heartwrenching romance that you don't see much of -- meetings of minds, genuine passion and love.

Culture and history as we know it have vanished. So now only a few fragments remain, and must be pieced back together with painstaking (and sometimes insane) skill. Not to mention a lot of (pitiful) academic bickering.<br /><br />The result is an intricate study of the Bootsie Club, the haunted stories of Binky Beaumont, the mysterious death of Woodrow Wilson's wife, Lola Montez, soap, the Cola Riots, analyzation of the peculiar diary entries (\\"Dear Diary, I am surprised that I am surprised anymore\\"), fragments of novels, and interestingly weird poetry.<br /><br />It's almost impossible to fully describe \\"Wilson: A Consideration of the Sources,\\" especially since it is only a novel in the sense that everything in it is fictional. Don't expect a linear storyline, or a story in one chunk. That's too normal, too ordinary, and too little fun. So Pulitzer-winning playwright/screenwriter/novelist Mamet takes a different route.<br /><br />It has no beginning. It has no real end. It can be read backwards, forwards, or from the middle outward. It's constantly self-referencing. It's a giant mass of snippets, anecdotes, and analyses. And while at first it seems like a dense, nonsensical mass of fictional bits, eventually the brain adjusts to it.<br /><br />Mamet spoofs the pompous tone that academics use -- there are studies of nursery rhymes in here! The smallest and most ridiculous bits of literature and history are studied, such as the Joke Code, a philosophical look at humor. In a possible homage to Nabokov, he also peppers the whole thing with footnotes.<br /><br />Every time the text seems to be getting too serious, Mamet throws in a footnote that proclaims \\"Why? Because it makes a pretty picture\\" or proclaiming, \\"Yah yah yah yah. I'm rubber and you're glue.\\" And don't forget his poetry: \\"The ponderous burdens of the few/to license, nay, inaugurate the new/peregrinations of the Wandering Jew...\\"<br /><br />Postmodernist comedy is at the heart of Mamet's twisted meta-history. \\"Wilson: A Consideration of the Sources\\" is hard to get into, but becomes weirdly funny when you \\"get it.\\"kov, he also peppers the whole thing with footnotes.   <br />  <br />Every time the text seems to be getting too serious, Mamet throws in a footnote that proclaims \\"Why?

There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. The stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the book, but becomes far more pleasant at the end.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

In \\"Good Wives,\\" the second half of the \\"Little Women\\" story (and the second part of an ongoing family saga), Alcott takes her little women out of teenage hijinks and into a darker, more adult place.<br /><br />The book opens with Meg March's wedding to John Brooke -- he's not the wealthy man of her dreams, but he is the man she loves. As Meg learns that it's a struggle to be a poor man's wife, her sisters Jo and Amy are stretching their own wings -- Amy is becoming an accomplished young artist, and Jo is letting \\"genius burn\\" as a published writer. Beth, who has never recovered from her bout of scarlet fever, is still a fragile homebody.<br /><br />Things take an unexpected turn when Aunt March invites Amy to go to Europe with her -- a trip Jo has wanted for years. To make things worse, Beth is in love with Laurie... but then Laurie proposes to Jo. When she rejects him, he storms away to Europe. Jo leaves as well, to be a governess and a writer in the city, but returns home to find Beth slowly wilting away. Tragedy, love and new life will bring the family back together in unexpected ways.<br /><br />It always hurts to grow up, and the events of \\"Good Wives\\" are no exception. It's a much more adult book than the first \\"Little Women,\\" with the girls finding out about love, marriage, careers, artistic attempts and the loss of loved ones. There's plenty of humor -- Jo's disastrous housecalls and Amy's equally disastrous dinner party -- but it's muted.<br /><br />Alcott's  writing, surprisingly, doesn't change much -- it's still funny, weird and highly detailed, but also full of sweetness and pathos. And while the book has some sad endings, the overall feel is that life goes on and things always turn out, if not happily, then for the best -- there are marriages, babies, and new beginnings for everyone. And it ends with a lead-in to the sequel, \\"Little Men,\\" with Jo and Professor Bhaer adopting a bunch of boys as unruly as Jo was.<br /><br />Jo is the same old Jo, with her foot in her mouth and her fierce independence. But she does become more mature and less prickly. Beth is almost a nonentity, wasting away until leaving the book altogether; Meg seems rather ditzy as a housewife, but apparently is shown as a Marmee-in-training. Amy does the best of all, becoming a vivid, funny character almost as likable as Jo.<br /><br />The second part of \\"Little Women\\" is \\"Good Wives\\" -- a very different kind of story about the March girls.

Then scrabbling noises inside the wall are revealed to be something else entirely -- a boy called Sebastian emerges, claiming to be the son of the man who built the house. He's also the son of an alchemist, and he's hibernated for centuries.<br /><br />Sebastian reveals that he is not the only alchemist who has hibernated to the modern day -- an evil enemy named de Loudeac has also survived to the present day. Now de Loudeac is stalking the kids, and is building a homunculus -- a soulless automaton that will do whatever he wants. It's up to Pip, Tim and Sebastian to stop him.<br /><br />If anyone thought that the latest Harry Potter novels were oh-so-dark, then they will be scared witless by this dark fantasy. Booth takes a step into nastier territory, with severed limbs, undead hippies, and a cameo by Satan. And he takes some history (medieval and alchemical) to base the entire plot on.<br /><br />But Booth does have a slightly clumsy way of writing fantasy. Sebastian launches into long lectures every chapter or so, and Booth doesn't manage to make them interesting. And the homunculus is built up as a big threat, then gets toasted within a page of appearing. However, he has a pretty solid writing style, with plenty of details and creepiness.<br /><br />Pip and Tim are fairly good heroes -- a little passive for my taste, but their gradual adjustment to a world of alchemists and magic is well done. Pip in particular is a good lead character, with plenty of promise. Sebastian is not so likable. He's a rather annoying know-it-all, and he never once acts like a twelve-year-old.<br /><br />Martin Booth's \\"Doctor Illuminatus: The Alchemist's Son Part I\\" has some deep flaws, but it also has quite a bit of promise for Booth's future alchemy books.

An old man, once a famous detective, now sits on his porch and contemplates his beekeeping -- when he sees a young boy with a parrot walk nearby. The boy, Linus, is intelligent but mute; his parrot Bruno just rattles off numbers in German. The boy is placed with the local clergyman, Mr. Panicker, who is struggling with his faith, and his unhappy wife.<br /><br />Then Bruno goes missing and the lodger Mr. Shane is found dead. Since it's unlikely that the parrot killed him, the police zone in on the Panickers' ne'er-do-well son. Then they call on the elderly detective -- not just to solve the murder, but to find the parrot, which they believe is reciting secret German codes.<br /><br />\\"The Final Solution\\" is more a story about people than a mystery, although the whole subplot about the parrots is very intriguing. But Chabon focuses on the story of Holmes -- who is never specifically named -- as he ponders his twilight years, and the changes in the world around him. It's a bit saddening to read about the legendary Victorian detective in WW II, out of sync with the rest of the world.<br /><br />Chabon also changes his usual writing style. In most of this book, he adjusts his style to be more like Arthur Conan Doyle's -- much more erudite, intelligent and mellow. There's one chapter that is pure Chabon (from the POV of Bruno the parrot), but the rest of the time, it feels like a much older book than it is, complete with vicarages, WW II spies and relics of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />The old man is clearly Sherlock Holmes, even though Chabon never mentions him by name. Perhaps it's to keep from treading on literary holy ground. But he brings the right mixture of warmth and crabbiness to \\"the old man.\\" He also gives depth to the supporting characters like Mr. Panicker (who is having a crisis of faith) and his wife (who has a crush on their lodger). Even Bruno gets well developed.<br /><br />While \\"Final Solution\\" isn't too great as a mystery, it's an excellent novel, and a poignant tale of Sherlock Holmes' final case.

But at least it's Douglas Coupland's view. In \\"City of Glass,\\" the author of \\"All Families Are Psychotic\\" and \\"Generation X\\" strays from fiction to write about his home city. The result is a subdued love ode to Vancouver, peppered with photographs.<br /><br />Coupland describes Vancouver with many page-long vignettes, sort of like a patchwork quilt: he describes feng shui in Vancouver, Japanese teenagers, a harbour full of sulfur piles, American couples on \\"love boats,\\" monstrous houses, and the quiet detachment that Vancouver feels from the Rest of Canada. (Which has its own entry -- really!)<br /><br />Coupland's fiction is generally distinguishable for its contemplative, cynically witty tones. But he drops all that for \\"City of Glass.\\" Okay, there is a chunk of \\"Life After God\\" in the middle, blurry text and pics. And occasionally the transcripts of Coupland's memories remind one of his fiction, seeming sadder and darker.<br /><br />Most of the time, he sounds fond and reminiscent, as if reliving the memories that come with salmon and fleece. Not to mention funny, such as when describing the confusing disagreements about feng shui (\\" this space should flowwwwww\\" or \\"flow is to be avoided at all costs\\"). And the photographs are quite good as well, with Coupland taking pictures of the prosaic subjects of his book -- a sleepy-looking Japanese teen, a fleece vest, a boat floating out on a light-filled harbor, a skiier in mid-twist on a sunlit hillside.<br /><br />\\"City of Glass\\" isn't exactly going to make you race to Vancouver, but it will make you appreciate the little hidden facets of the city -- and perhaps make you notice the ones in your own.	2004-12-20

It's an entertaining novella, but not Jones' best.<br /><br />Heather lives at Castlemaine, where her parents are the curators. But Heather hates the tourists and the lack of privacy. Then one day, she climbs onto an old mound and wishes that the legendary Wild Robert would come help her get rid of the tourists. Then she hears a voice: \\"Did someone call?\\"<br /><br />It turns out that Wild Robert has been trapped in the mound for over three hundred years, because he studied the magic arts. Now he's just as ticked off as Heather is about the tourists -- but unlike Heather, he has no problem using his magic to help drive them away...<br /><br />Diana Wynne-Jones seems to specialize in stories about the fantastical intruding on everyday people. And \\"Wild Robert\\" is one of those books. It's only a short novella (or long short story), but Jones manages to keep the storyline interesting and original (such as the feud of the old paintings).<br /><br />Jones' customary sense of humor carries the story along, with the background about medieval witchcraft, magic, and the clash with modern-day tourists (who can be pretty obnoxious). The problem is that there isn't much of a plot -- Wild Robert visits, works magic, and weird things happen. At the end of the book, the story is clearly ongoing. Nothing changes, except that Wild Robert is hanging around.<br /><br />Heather and Wild Robert are the principal characters in this book, and they are the only ones who get much development. Heather is a fairly typical Jones heroine, gutsy and willing to believe the unbelievable. It's Wild Robert himself who steals the show, with his tragic past and distinctly odd sense of humor.<br /><br />\\"Wild Robert\\" is an entertaining light read, with a likable half-living hero and plenty of supernatural hijinks, but at the end you wish that Jones had expanded it into a fuller book.f supernatural hijinks, but at the end you wish that Jones had expanded it into a fuller book.	2004-12-20

Without missing a step, \\"Lirael\\" follows in \\"Sabriel\\"'s footsteps, with the same dark blend of humor and horror.<br /><br />Lirael is a daughter of the Clayr, but she won't be a full Clayr until she gains the Sight. On her fourteenth birthday, she is the oldest girl to not yet have gained the Sight. After contemplating suicide, Lirael is assigned to work in the library, and inadvertantly sets loose a hideous Free Magic creature: a Stilken that will call other Free Magic creatures and destroy the Clayr. Desperate to deal with her mistake, Lirael calls up the Disreputable Dog (somehow made both of Free and Charter Magic) and soon ends up finding out more about her past -- and her future.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Sabriel's son Sameth is pursued by the Dead, and is almost killed in the process; the only thing he gets for his trouble is a threat from a mysterious necromancer. Sam is supposed to be the future Abhorsen, but the problem is that he's petrified by the things his mother handles easily. And he's helped loose Free Magic on a world increasingly torn by a mysterious masked necromancer...<br /><br />Nix takes the rich world he created in \\"Sabriel\\" and makes it even richer. It's a bit like a melding of typical high fantasy with an early twentieth-century setting (phones, buses, cricket matches, electricity, guns). Old faves like Sabriel, Touchstone, and Mogget appear here (although Mogget's appearance is a bit brief), along with new and equally likable characters.<br /><br />Some readers may not like Lirael as well as they liked the more self-assured, kick-butt Sabriel, but Sabriel knew who she was, where she was coming from, and knew what she needed to know. Lirael is only learning those things, which makes her a more vulnerable, confused heroine. She becomes stronger and more self-assured as she learns more about Charter magery and her background.<br /><br />\\"Lirael\\" has the same balance of humor and horror as the first book.

Luigi Pirandello kicked theatre convention out the door with \\"Six Characters in Search of an Author.\\" Illusion and reality get a bit bent out of shape, as fictional characters stroll about and converse with managers and actors. It's a brilliant piece of existentialist work, and one that had a distinct effect on theatre after that.<br /><br />It opens with several unnamed theatre people -- the Manager, the Leading Man, the Prompter -- rehearsing a play in an empty theatre. \\"During this manoeuvre, the Six CHARACTERS enter, and stop by the door at back of stage,\\" Pirandello tells us: a florid Father, timid Mother, equally timid Boy, arrogant Son, sexy Step-Daughter and too-young-to-have-much-personality Child.<br /><br />\\"As a matter of fact . . . we have come here in search of an author . . .\\" the Father tells the manager. The characters have been abandoned by their author, who \\"no longer wished, or was no longer able\\" to put them into a story. And now they want the theatre company to provide them with a vehicle that will make them immortal -- and they have to convince the Manager that they are worthy.<br /><br />Pirandello dispels the unreality of the play with \\"Oh sir, you know well that life is full of infinite absurdities, which, strangely enough, do not even need to appear plausible, since they are true.\\" While the events of this play seems to be sort of gimmicky, Pirandello uses them with unusual grace (and not a few moments of bizarre comedy).<br /><br />The characterizations are among the weirdest I've ever seen -- we have an entire family drama going on without a play/novel/film for it. Lovers, illegitimate kids, sibling rivalry and marital fights. Ironically, the Character family overshadows the \\"real\\" people on the stage. The Manager is a fun character, though, perpetually impatient and overstressed. \\"Pretence? Reality?

His \\"Man With the Blue Guitar\\" is a pretty short collection in comparison to the sprawling \\"Harmonium\\" but it's a solid collection anyway.<br /><br />It begins with the title work, a 33-canto work with an almost singsong rhythm. The only thing each canto has in common is the blue guitar, usually mentioned in passing. Around that image, Stevens spins visions of cold moons, empty partying, music and beauty, storms, glorious explosions of pure light, and much more. \\"Each is both star and orb; and day/Is the riches of their atmosphere...\\"<br /><br />But then Stevens stretches to somewhat more luxurious poetry: the sprawling \\"Owl's Clover,\\" a rich and evocative poem that stretches from graveyards to Africa to the mind of mankind. Finally he includes two poems that seem almost tacked on: the more modern \\"A Thought Revolved,\\" and the sleepy, almost songlike \\"Men That Are Falling.\\"<br /><br />\\"Man With the Blue Guitar\\" (the book, not the poem) is not one of Stevens' more even collections. But it is remarkably beautiful and accomplished, showing that Stevens was gaining skill in his writing. His style of poetry is rich and full of surrealistic detail, such as \\"A group of marble horses rose on wings/In the midst of a circle of trees, from which the leaves/raced with the horses in bright hurricanes.\\"<br /><br />Stevens also weaves in a few of his personal views, such as the apparent belief that art (especially poetry) could replace typical religion. Obviously very few people think that, but it's still striking to see his opinions turned into verse: \\"The earth, for us, is flat and bare./There are no shadows. Poetry/Exceeding music must take the place/Of empty heaven and its hymns.\\"<br /><br />Wallace Stevens' brief \\"Man With the Blue Guitar\\" is a dreamy, songlike collection that sticks to your mind long after it's done.

(The actual author is Dugald A. Steer).<br /><br />Without robbing dragons of their mystique, we get an overview of them: there are intricate studies of the different kinds of dragons, from the Eastern lung to the Australian marsupial (which is a bit too silly for the tongue-in-cheek tone of the book). \\"Dr. Drake\\" also examines their habits, such as courtship rituals and parenting, as well as the the biological means by which they spew flames, and the reason why they hoard gems.<br /><br />He also gives quite a bit of advice for the budding dragonolist, ranging from the obscure (hide shiny objects from baby dragons) to the ordinary (wear fireproof clothing). Finally, there is a historical overview of famous dragonologists from around the world, and spells that assist them.<br /><br />Dragons are a staple of legend and literature, although a neglected one. Though \\"Dragonology\\" is presented as a serious work, Steer never forgets to keep his tongue in cheek. It's a fun read, with lots of detail and thought -- after all, it can't be easy to document the physiology of a beast that doesn't, technically, exist.<br /><br />Taken on its own, the book might merely be cute. But Steer also includes little details like a faux library card belonging to Ernest Drake, a little letter enclosed in a special envelope, and an inscription on the inner front cover: \\"To Friendly Dragons\\" followed by a bunch of Tolkienesque runes.<br /><br />And the illustrations are as much a part as the faux-scholarly text.

His wife thinks it's a waste and his friends think that he's starting to crack (\\"I guess you're not up to P, for 'Please shut up'\\"). His father doesn't think he can do it, because he once tried, and stopped somewhere in the mid-Bs.<br /><br />Undaunted, Jacobs reads determinedly through the encyclopedias, finding out various facts: Absalom (\\"has the oddest death so far in the encyclopedia\\"), how Hollywood stole \\"Planet of the Apes\\" from the Aztecs, Queen Victoria's musical bustle, the metric system, a hippie-Christian sex cult, and the delinquent antics of teenage Gandhi. Not to mention \\"Addled Brain Syndrome,\\" which comes from too much encyclopedia reading.<br /><br />As he slowly but faithfully slogs through the encyclopedia, Jacobs finds out quite a few intriguing new things -- not just about himself, but about the difference between being smart and knowledgeable. And as he offers his wacky thoughts on the various encyclopedia entries, he often strays into tangents about his family, his childhood (he had a phobia about people touching his head), and his struggles with his wife to have a baby.<br /><br />\\"The Know-It-All : One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World\\" -- the title says it all. The book is basically the encyclopedia, filtered through the thoughts of a thirtysomething guy with quite a sense of humor. It's certainly understandable that Jacobs would want to be smarter -- everyone feels intellectually insufficient at one time or another.<br /><br />What makes Jacobs so funny? His self-deprecating humor, for one thing -- he isn't afraid to make fun of himself (and his brain capacity) constantly. One of the funniest scenes of the book is when he goes to a party and tries to display his newfound knowledge, only to make his pals very nervous. When told \\"I can't wait to get some sun. Look how white I am,\\" Jacobs simply blurts out, \\"Albinism affects one in twenty thousand Americans.\\" Nice try, but no cigar.<br /><br />And... Jacobs is just funny. He has a knack for adding his own thoughts about the entries; when reading about Rubens, he comments, \\"Now I know: I don't have to yell and scream and throw artichokes at waiters to qualify as an artistic genius.\\" And it takes someone with a real sense of comic timing to say \\"In the 18th century, everyone smelled like salad\\" and make it seem not only funny, but logical.<br /><br />\\"The Know-It-All : One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World\\" is an apt title for a wildly entertaining book.

It is possible to produce books like that that are also funny and even enlightening, but \\"Gossip Girl\\" is essentially a plodding, repetitive attempt at a \\"real\\" teen book.<br /><br />The beautiful Serena has returned from a sojourn in a ritzy private school and some time in France. Pretty bulimic Blair is dismayed by this, as Serena has unconsciously usurped the position that Blair had been occupying. Even worse, Blair's boyfriend Nate once slept with Serena and is still interested in her, but Serena is not really interested in Nate. Dan is besotted with her, and Jenny looks up to her.<br /><br />Rumors begin to fly about Serena -- that she's slutty, that she has a variety of STDs, that she had a baby in France, that she was thrown out of her boarding school, that she's had several abortions, and just about every other kind of vicious rumor. And presiding over all of this is Gossip Girl, a mysterious omniscient observer who reports online about the tangled lives of her friends and peers.<br /><br />It seems that readers will never tire of the antics of too-rich Manhattanites, especially if they live empty lives that they believe are significant. Like Nick McDonell's \\"Twelve,\\" this book is filled with shallow, obnoxious characters who do drugs, sex, alcohol, and mourn the problems of their privileged lives. The drugs, sex, alcohol, bulimia and angst serve no actual purpose in the plot; they are merely attempts to shock.<br /><br />The problem is that they are handled in such a haphazard manner that they don't shock at all -- they are merely diversions to spice up the lack of plot. Strip them away, and there's pretty much nothing left. Von Ziegesar never makes an attempt to get the readers interested. We are never given a reason to react to anyone in this book, either to be interested or repelled by them -- only bored.<br /><br />Those characters are stereotypes, in a fictional world where the elite rich are all gorgeous: the scheming insecure girl, the mystery beauty, the shy naive girl, the weak handsome guy, the promiscuous guy, and dozens of others are devoid of any originality. They are part of the stereotype that teenagers are intrinsically shallow and can't be bothered with anyone who is not of interest to them.<br /><br />Admittedly, the \\"Gossip Girl\\" website extracts are amusing. There's a certain wit to them, and they are also the only parts of the book that show some genuine originality. I only wish there had been more of them, and fewer repetitive rumors about Serena's past. The writing style lacks detail or any sort of wit or spiciness. And, like, the dialogue is so, you know, like, stupid, right?<br /><br />Perhaps the worst part of the book is the finale, which fails to produce a climax or wrap up any loose threads. The book simply stops. Perhaps this is an effort to get readers to read the sequel, if they aren't too disgusted by the plodding storyline and grating characters. Von Ziegesar, take a writing class.pelled by them -- only bored.  <br /> <br />Those characters are stereotypes, in a fictional world where the elite rich are all gorgeous: the scheming insecure girl, the mystery beauty, the shy naive girl, the weak handsome guy, the promiscuous guy, and dozens of others are devoid of any originality.

Roisin McAuley's debut \\"Singing Bird\\" starts as a family drama, evolving into a look at children, fidelity, marital love, religion and most importantly, the story of adoption and family.<br /><br />Twenty-seven years ago, successful businessman Jack and his wife Lena had no children... until they went on vacation in Ireland. There, a local nun asked if they wanted to adopt a baby, and because they were desperate for a child, they accepted. Now, their daughter Mary is beautiful, accomplished, and a rapidly ascending opera star.<br /><br />Then one day, Lena receives a phone call from the nun. She's about to retire, and is checking up on her \\"babies,\\" but Lena is strangely uneasy. She decides to travel to Ireland to find out more, and ends up searching for Mary's birth parents... and her own. But as she searches through the cold trails, Lena finds out disturbing truths about the past... and a dark secret in her own marriage.<br /><br />This is apparently Roisin McAuley's first book. That comes as something of a pleasant surprise, since her writing is so polished. \\"Singing Bird\\" is a pretty simple story that tackles a variety of topics, and delivers a gut-punch as well. Not many authors can do that on their first attempt.<br /><br />McAuley's writing style is very plain and mostly lacking in detail. But it does have quite an impact -- she uses quiet language to communicate issues without being preachy. There's an ominous undertone from the first page onward, hinting at the intensity that builds up in a climax in the last chapters. Saying any more would give away the secrets that Lena uncovers.<br /><br />Lena herself is an unusual heroine, forging ahead through all the nasty little secrets buried in Ireland. The things she finds challenge her Catholic faith, and her belief in family, but in the end she ends up stronger than ever. Her husband Jack is something of a dark horse, although that is necessary to the plot; her rambunctious pal Alma is a lot more interesting.<br /><br />\\"Singing Bird\\" is an unusual, intense book, and is an unusually polished debut for Ms. McAuley. A dramatic novel that is definitely worth reading.Jack is something of a dark horse, although that is necessary to the plot; her rambunctious pal Alma is a lot more interesting.  <br /> <br />\\"Singing Bird\\" is an unusual, intense book, and is an unusually polished debut for Ms. McAuley.

It's a guilty pleasure with a literate twist and a likably wry main character.<br /><br />Glossy magazine Fashionista is like \\"Seinfeld\\" -- it's about nothing. All they do is retread celebrity fashion of the moment, check out celebrity fashion of the past, and just about anything vapid involving celebrities. (Seeing a trend here?) Vig Morgan got involved in this magazine for the glamour, but finds that it's sadly lacking. Iron-rod editor-in-chief Jane McNeill is intent on keeping it vapid and celebrity-driven, even though her staff yearns to give the mag a little substance.<br /><br />Then a rebellion starts brewing in the ranks. Vig finds herself turned into the linchpin of a conspiracy to get controversial fashion artist Gavin Marshall and his Gilding the Lily (or, to be blunter, \\"Jesus in Drag\\" -- Jesus statues in designer women's garb) exhibit into the magazine. But will the uproar be enough to overturn Jane?<br /><br />Ever since the publication of \\"The Nanny Diaries,\\" there have been a slew of my-job-is-hell-and-my-boss-is-a-demon books. \\"Fashionistas\\" manages to avoid the pitfalls of most books like that. The biggest pit that it DOES fall into is the not-a-relationship that Vig has with the mysterious Alex Keller -- it really adds nothing to the book, and just seems to take up pages that could be devoted to catty power struggles.<br /><br />Those catty power struggles are what make \\"Fashionista\\" so delicious at times. Vig's deadpan recounting of the quirky workplace characters is fun to read. While their oddities sometimes strain believability, they always manage to seem like people who could actually exist. And Messina does a decent job of lampooning the art world (Jesus statues with women's designer clothes), the fashion world, and magazines in general. Since she herself writes for magazines, it somehow doesn't seem surprising.<br /><br />Vig actually seems like a smart, interesting female lead. She doesn't whine constantly about her weight, her boyfriend, and grimly takes it in stride when she has to cover Cate Blanchett's \\"curly\\" phase. Sort-of-boyfriend Alex is a nonentity, and so are quite a few of Vig's coworkers. Maya is a good sidekick for Vig: She's an emotional mess with unpublished novels, a nasty ex, and many stages of grief.<br /><br />Lynn Messina's take on the fashion world is a nice beach-read. Or if you don't have a beach handy, then \\"Fashionista\\" is merely a pleasant light read with plenty of cattiness, fashion and inter-magazine power struggles.on world, and magazines in general.

That question is at the heart of Sebastien Japrisot's \\"A Very Long Engagement,\\" a quiet little story about love and war. While the story drags a little at times, the exquisite story of Matti and the love for a man whom she won't believe is dead.<br /><br />Wheelchair-bound Mathilde grew up with Manech, and as teenagers they fell in love and became engaged. But Manech is killed in action, leaving Matti to dwell on her imaginary adventures. But one day she is contacted by a dying veteran, Daniel Esperanza, who tells her a terrible story -- Manech was one of five men who shot themselves in the hand to avoid fighting. Because of that, they were condemned to death: sent to the front lines with their hands bound.<br /><br />But Matti doesn't accept it -- she believes that there is chance, even a small one, that Manech survived somehow. She has her friends assist her in searching through mounds of paperwork, and she herself writes to anyone who might be able to help her -- ex-officers, widows, and lovers. And slowly Matti begins to piece together what happened that day -- and why Manech might still be alive.<br /><br />\\"A Very Long Engagement\\" is complex and a bit confusing, but it's also worth the effort. Japrisot takes a simple plot and gives it some extra twists, a few lessons about war and misery -- but at its heart, \\"Engagement\\" is just about love and determination. It's difficult not to be stirred by Matti's long quest to find her lover.<br /><br />Japrisot's complex paper trail is a bit hard to follow, and the novel tends to drag in the middle, which is mostly Matti reading and writing letters. Japrisot seems uncertain where to go at that point. But the novel is also a jigsaw puzzle -- the German boots, the color of a young man's eyes, a lost hand, and a packet of old letters are all pieces. And many scenes in it are exceptionally tender and beautifully written. Matti's flashbacks and fantasies are dreamy, and even the real world seems to be a bit hazy. The climactic scene is without a doubt the most beautiful, understated and yet deeply romantic.<br /><br />Japrisot created a wonderful character in Matti. Despite being stuck in a wheelchair, she doesn't let this hold her back; she lets her mind fly in all sorts of fantasies. Perhaps it's that childlike belief in the unbelievable that lets her hold on to the belief that Manech is alive. And though Manech only appears for a few pages over the whole book, he becomes as strong as presence as Matti is. Japrisot avoids the cliches of young lovers, while convincing readers that what Matti and Manech share is stronger than anything that comes between them.<br /><br />\\"A Very Long Engagement\\" (now a movie starring Audrey Tautou) is an exquisite love story, heartbreaking and uplifting at once.

Here the hapless college student both encounters new obstacles... and finds that he is starting to warm Kyoko's heart.<br /><br />Yusaku's inability to break up with platonic girlfriend Kozue starts a horrible fight between himself and Kyoko. But when Kyoko almost falls from a rooftop, Yusaku rescues he -- and he's the one who falls off instead, breaking his leg. When Yusaku is in the hospital, Kyoko is wracked with guilt, and decides that she is going to repress her jealousy (\\"withdraw from the race\\"), because they aren't even a couple.<br /><br />But Kyoko is having a tough time keeping her promise, especially when Yusaku's cute -- and very cuddle-prone -- cousin arrives. Fortunately, the cousin is engaged to another guy, and needs the help of the Maison Ikkoku gang to elope -- except the elopement injures Yusaku further. He and Kyoko start to grow closer and closer... until hunky rival Mitaka also breaks his leg, and ends up in the hospital bed next to Yusaku's.<br /><br />Romancing an older woman would be tough enough for a struggling college student. But what about an older woman who is still in love with her late husband? As daunting as that is, Yusaku makes some serious progress with Kyoko in this volume, except for the constant interruptions from their respective rivals.<br /><br />The first few stories in this collection are relatively lightweight, focusing on a three-legged race and getting rid of Grandma Godai. But then the heavier relationship stuff starts. Author Rumiko Takahashi mixes light comedy and heavy romance, without letting the love rectangle get stale or silly.<br /><br />As Takahashi always does, her characters are changing slowly -- Kyoko is obviously starting to let go of her dead husband, and Godai is starting to get a wee bit more mature (although he still cries like a baby when he thinks she doesn't care about him). And this volume also introduces the mysterious Mr. Ichinose, who serves as a warning to the romantically timid. (Read: A warning to Mr. I-can't-break-up-with-a-girl Yusaku)<br /><br />Rumiko Takahashi's \\"Maison Ikkoku\\" is still going strong in its seventh volume, and promises more comedy and romantic misunderstandings to come.

While occasionally his lead character's \\"top five\\" lists can be a little annoying, this is a charmingly original, wry and thoughtful novel - an offbeat romance for our time.<br /><br />Rob owns a little music shop in London, which is a good thing because he is musically obsessed -- pop music, he claims, makes him fall in love. But even pop music can't heal his heart when his longtime girlfriend Laura breaks up and moves out. What's worse, Rob has no idea WHY she broke up with him, and he feels mixed feelings about losing her (he cares about her) and her musical tastes (bad).<br /><br />He immerses himself in his rickety business with his weirdo employees -- these guys alone are worth checking out the book for. He dates a folk singer. He learns that Laura is now involved with the repulsive guy upstairs. And finally, he assesses his past sex life and romances (the top five, specifically), getting a bit of insight into what Laura's problem with him might be: He's stuck in his mid-teens.<br /><br />Thirty-five is kind of old to start growing up. But like many real people, Rob learns that it's change or die -- in his case, alone and surrounded by records. \\"High Fidelity\\" is a nice blend of musical/movie memoir, love story and belated-coming-of-age tale. It's kind of geeky and pokes fun at itself, but therein lies its charm.<br /><br />Hornby writes a nice, breezy kind of prose, peppered with plenty of pop culture and musical references. Not to mention the top five lists: Top Five Episodes of Cheers. Best Side One Track Ones Of All Time. Top Five Bands or Musicians Who Will Have To Be Shot Come the Musical Revolution. At times the pop culture name-dropping gets a bit tiresome, but it mostly underlines how quirky and mildly obsessive Rob can be.<br /><br />And oh, he can be quirky. He can also be a self-centered jerk, and a bit confused and clueless to boot. Hornby's alter ego is likable for his flaws, and somehow manages to shed a little light on how men think. Good backup comes in his clerks Barry and Dick, who are just as geekily eccentric about music and lists as Rob is.<br /><br />Nick Hornby's \\"High Fidelity\\" is an excellent slice of Brit-lit -- it's quirky, wry, insightful, and a bit obsessed with good music.

Now, with rodent adventure \\"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents,\\" Pratchett expands Discworld from adult fantasy to young adult fantasy as well.<br /><br />A boy, a cat, and a troupe of rats arrive at the town of Bad Blintz. But while Keith is normal, feline Maurice and his \\"educated rodents\\" are not -- they speak, think, and are self-aware (they ate wizards' garbage). And they have a nice racket going, where the rats pretend to infest a town (they gnaw things and \\"widdle\\" on the flour), and Keith poses as a piper to lead them away. But something is wrong with Bad Blintz -- there are no native rats, yet the rat-catchers claim that there's an outright plague of them, and are producing rat-tails to prove it. (They bear a remarkable resemblance to shoelaces)<br /><br />With the help of a too-imaginative-for-her-own good girl named Malicia, Keith and Maurice begin to investigate why all the rats are gone, and what the rat-catchers are up to. But when they discover the conspiracy, Maurice starts hearing the voice of something down in the sewers -- something evil, something powerful, something that can command hundreds of rats...<br /><br />Pratchett is reknowned for his new spins on old material. Much as he gave a new spin to MacBeth in \\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" here he gives a new spin to the \\"Pied Piper\\" legend, with some interesting philosophy and his trademarked humor as well. Does the idea of talking animals and preteens make you cringe? Don't -- Pratchett handles it with rare style.<br /><br />There's plenty of humor in this book, from the names of the rats (Dangerous Beans, Additives, Big Savings, Toxie) to Sardines, the tap-dancing rat with a hat to the incident with the laxatives. His dialogue is still brilliant, especially when he deflates tense scenes (\\"Think of my dear wife and my four lovely children who'll be without their daddy!\\" \\"You're not married. You don't have any children!\\" \\"I might want some day!\\").<br /><br />But Pratchett doesn't forget the deeper currents either -- the sense of evil he builds up is very genuine, and Spider is one of the most unique fantasy villains he's created. Also good is the attitude of the Changed rats: they cherish their greater intelligence, fear their instincts, and gradually we see them overcome some of those ratty instincts. Rather than eating one of their dead, they bury him like humans do.<br /><br />Keith is a nice character, seeming dim but surprisingly intelligent. Maurice is the character that Pratchett does best -- he seems, initially, to have no good characteristis, but he's a good person underneath. (With a dirty little secret involving one of the rats) The Educated Rodents are all given individual personalities that Pratchett juggles very well. And Dangerous Beans, a little blind rat, has one of the best scenes in which he confronts the mysterious Spider.<br /><br />\\"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents\\" isn't actually that different from Pratchett's adult fantasies, and older fans of that series will enjoy this one just as much as the kids.

Lewis Carroll is best known as the warped mind that brought us \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking Glass.\\" He was also a poet. Not an introspective, pensive, or anguished poet, but someone who spun up little nonsense rhymes.<br /><br />Several are selected from Carroll's best-known books, such as \\"The Mouse's Tale,\\" where the content isn't too interesting... but the poem itself is shaped like a mouse's tail. Another is \\"Jabberwocky,\\" the famed poem about a young man who slays a monster. At least half the words are made up. (\\"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!/The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!/ Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun/the frumious Bandersnatch!\\")<br /><br />There is also a selection of his early poetry and his non-Alice poetry, such as the \\"Mad Gardener's Song,\\" where a gardener spends most of his time hallucinating: \\"He thought he saw an Elephant,/That practised on a fife:/He looked again, and found it was/A letter from his wife.'\\" Okay, whatever. Poems are included from the little-known \\"Phantasmagorica,\\" \\"Sylvie and Bruno,\\" and other collections.<br /><br />\\"How shall I be a poet?/How shall I write in rhyme?\\" Carroll inquires in \\"Poeta Fit, Non Nascitur,\\" a pleasant little poem about writing poetry. His poetry tends to be comedic, but there are a few that are halfway serious, such as \\"Sea Dirge,\\" a poem entirely devoted to Carroll's aquaphobia. No, it's not downbeat, but it isn't exactly goofball poetry either.<br /><br />The whimsical insanity of Carroll's poetry is what makes it so appealing. Technically it's pretty ordinary, with the flaw of making up words to insure rhyme schemes. But somehow his poetry is so colorful and funny that the flaws aren't much of a downside -- especially \\"Jabberwocky,\\" where the whole appeal of the poem is that it's utter nonsense.<br /><br />Anyone who has read \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" can't help but notice Carroll's whimsical, creative poetry. And \\"Jabberwocky and Other Poems\\" is a pretty good introduction to his kooky verse.y verse.	2004-12-06

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

But Janice Kaplan and Lynn Schnurnberger aim a bit higher in \\"The Botox Diaries,\\" an entertaining but flawed look at the lives of New York's fortysomething mothers and wives.<br /><br />Single mom Jessica Taylor is trying to keep up with the deranged supermoms, while her flighty producer pal Lucy fixes her up on disastrous dates with horny plastic surgeons. And then Jessica realizes that Lucy is cheating on her lovable husband Dan, with a boorish TV host. Now Jessica is stuck between her two friends, as Lucy takes resort trips and tantric sex lessons with her new lover. What makes it even worse is that Lucy's \\"what he doesn't know won't hurt him\\" attitude is exactly like that of Jessica's ex-husband, Jacques.<br /><br />Coincidentally, Jacques then reappears in Jessica's life, and seems to be trying to win her back. She allows herself to be swept along, but wonders what it is really up -- and if Jacques can learn to be faithful. Between reluctantly dating a gay surfer and attending a Botox party, Jessica struggles to fix both her own life and Lucy's disintegrating marriage.<br /><br />Few books take a look at the female midlife crisis -- let's face it, women can panic as easily as men about turning forty. Even so, it's a bit hard not to cringe as Lucy blithely cheats on her husband, assuming that her side nookie won't be uncovered. At one point, the wit falls away in favor of drama, when it looks like Lucy's marriage is over forever.<br /><br />But the book is about more than just midlife crises -- Kaplan and Schnurnberger also look at experienced romance, aging (and Botox), motherhood, and the pressure to keep up with deranged supermoms. Their style is witty and detailed, although the plot tends to meander. However, they have a witty, literate edge to their writing, without seeming to name-drop. Jessica's description of Chekhov as a Russian \\"Sex and the City\\" is hilarious.<br /><br />Jessica is the \\"au naturel\\" one -- she's very unself-conscious and down to earth. She's a little too passive, however -- why couldn't she tip Dan off anonymously? Lucy is a stereotype of the shallow, overmoneyed woman, and Jacques a stereotype of the faithless French lover. Sadly, the book falls into the old chick-lit trap of providing a convenient love interest for Jessica, though they have zero chemistry and he appears less often than the Gen-X gay surfer.<br /><br />An awkward love story mars this story of love, motherhood, infidelity and botulism. But \\"The Botox Diaries\\" is still an entertaining read, especially for the forty-plus set -- really, aren't you sick of all chick-lit heroines being the same age?\\"Sex and the City\\" is hilarious.  <br />  <br />Jessica is the \\"au naturel\\" one -- she's very unself-conscious and down to earth.

Bass makes a stunning debut in \\"Sign of the Qin,\\" the first book of a series drawing on Chinese myth and legend. Taut, lushly written and wonderfully characterized, \\"Sign\\" is an enthralling fantasy with plenty of action, mythic monsters, and a dash of romance and destiny.<br /><br />The emperor is horrified when he sees his newborn son, because the child has the mark of the Qin, a rebel sign, on his cheek. He throws out the child's mother, Silver Lotus, and secretly plots to kill the baby -- especially since the commoners adore him, since they believe he is the new Starlord, who will renounce his noble birth and be their savior. But the Starlord has a nursemaid and rebel allies who will do whatever it takes to keep him safe.<br /><br />A recent volcanic eruption has let all sorts of demons loose on the land, and the evil Lord of the Dead Yamu is also plotting against the Starlord's life, calling out vile shapeshifters and evil harpies. To combat him, the lords of heaven send the incorrigible trickster Monkey to take care of the innocent little boy as he comes closer to his rebel allies.<br /><br />Like a flower, \\"Sign\\" has to unfold slowly and carefully. But Bass makes it worth the while, infusing the story with lots of character development and background information. Chinese legends aren't used very often in fantasy, allowing Bass's story to seem entirely fresh and original, complete with sea dragons and conveniently-placed goddesses.<br /><br />Bass's writing is suitably detailed and solemn, with lots of details on swords, filthy streets and jewelry. The descriptions of things like moving tattoos or statues coming to life are astounding. But there's humor as well; the immortality-hungry Monkey provides most of it, but there is also the putrid demon kappa being defeated with good manners, or the elaborate funeral held for a woman who had only fainted. And most stunning of all are the action scenes, usually quite bloody, gritty and very fast-paced.<br /><br />At first glance, Prince Zong (or \\"little Starlord\\") seems like a pretty typical Child of Destiny -- he walks and talks within days of being born, and has immense wisdom. But Bass makes him a little naive and very sweet. The twin rebels (who are also sons of a sea-dragon) White Streak and Black Whirlwind are also well-drawn. Even the villains like Yamu and the snivelling Emperor are well-written.<br /><br />Bass provides a slow-moving but rich fantasy in \\"Sign of the Qin,\\" and the finale promises more adventures to come. Fantastical, funny and grim, this is a definite must-read.<br /> <br />At first glance, Prince Zong (or \\"little Starlord\\") seems like a pretty typical Child of Destiny -- he walks and talks within days of being born, and has immense wisdom.

Tolkien wrote this in a charming, arch style, and seems to have had fun subverting some of the fantasy cliches that he helped create -- particularly that of the dragonslaying hero and the dragon he must deal with.<br /><br />Aegidius de Hammo (or in the \\"vulgar tongue,\\" as Tolkien archly tells us, Farmer Giles of Ham) is a pleasant, not-too-bright farmer (a bit like Barliman Butterbur) who leads a fairly happy, sedate life. Until the day his excitable dog Garm warns him that a giant (deaf and very near-sighted) is stomping through and causing mayhem. Giles takes out his blunderbuss and takes a shot at the giant, and inadverantly drives him off.<br /><br />Naturally, Giles is hailed as a hero. Even the King is impressed, and sends him the sword Caudimordax (vulgar name: Tailbiter), which belonged to a dragonslaying hero. By chance, the not-so-fierce dragon Chrysophylax Dives has started pillaging, destroying and attacking the nearby areas. Can a not-so-heroic farmer drive off a not-so-frightening dragon?<br /><br />\\"Farmer Giles of Ham\\" is one of those Tolkien stories that seems to be aimed at very literate kids, or adults who haven't lost that taste for very British, arch whimsy. It's a fast, fun little adventure story with blundering giants, greedy dragons and unlikely heroes. It's not epic and it's not deep, but it is entertaining -- especially since Tolkien expertly blends the whole high fantasy thing with a wicked sense of humour (\\"if it is your notion to go dragonhunting jingling and dingling like Canterbury Bells, it ain't mine\\").<br /><br />Particularly, Tolkien seems to be gently mocking medieval fables, both as a linguist (the \\"vulgar tongue\\" comments) and as a storyteller (he young dragons exclaiming that they always knew \\"knights were mythical!\\"). Most particularly, he seems to be mocking the classic heroes who slay dragons or giants, mainly by making both heroes and monsters not quite as threatening as expected. He inserts plenty of humorous anachronisms (the blunderbuss) and clever in-jokes (Caudimordax, a sword which is incapable of being sheathed if a dragon is within five miles of it).<br /><br />Farmer Giles is a pretty fun character -- he's presented as a fairly ordinary, common-sensical person called upon to do some bizarre and extraordinary things... so, basically a typical Tolkien hero, although he has a talking dog that keeps causing trouble for him. His enemy Chrysophylax is in a sense his opposite, being \\" cunning, inquisitive, greedy, well-armoured, but not over bold.\\" He's kind of like a funny version of Smaug, minus the destruction of cities.<br /><br />\\"Farmer Giles of Ham\\" is a charming little chunk of Tolkien's minor work -- a relentlessly wry, clever little fantasy story about a most unlikely hero.

He includes old favorites like \\"The Twelve Days of Christmas,\\" which is almost impossible to remember every verse of, the bouncy \\"We Wish You A Merry Christmas,\\" and the solemn balladic \\"Silent Night.\\"<br /><br />However, Weller doesn't just stick to well-known favorites. He also dips into a large store of lesser-known carols such as \\"Good King Wenceslas\\" -- sure, people know the first first four or five lines, but what comes after that? Anyway, the lesser-known, richly traditional carols include the lullaby-like \\"Coventry Carol,\\" the enchanting part-Latin \\"The Snow Lay on the Ground,\\" and the enchanting \\"Wassail Song.\\"<br /><br />The real gems of this collection are, in fact, the much older traditional carols -- they can be just as catchy as the more recent ones (\\"Here we come a-wassailing/Among the leaves so green,/Here we come a wand'ring,/So fair to be seen\\"). And not all of the most recent ones as well known, such as Christina Rossetti's \\"In the Bleak Midwinter,\\" a carol/poem she wrote for a newspaper.<br /><br />While the book is of the cheap quality -- rather slimy paper and cover -- needed to keep the price affordable, a few flourishes are given to it, like cute little holly decorations over the songs. The songs are arranged alphabetically, which is either good or bad -- good for finding them quickly, bad for singing all in order.<br /><br />\\"Christmas Carols: Complete Verses\\" is a surprisingly good selection of carols, old and new, well-known and obscure.

To stop the Grey King, Will must learn the secret of Bran's past and evade the dangerous farmer Caradog Pritchard...<br /><br />Atmosphere is thick and enticing in \\"Grey King\\" -- Cooper has clearly come a long way from the fluffier \\"Over Sea Under Stone.\\" This book, unlike \\"Greenwitch,\\" does not handle the Drew family, or even much about Merriman: it's all about Bran and Will, who are given equal parts of the plotline. Though there are many other characters, these two are the core of the story.<br /><br />Here the Arthurian theme, which has been present in a smaller way throughout the series, becomes more pronounced and integral. Cooper continues interweaving mythic elements into it, such as the Sleepers, Cafall the dog, and the Brenin Llwyd. Fans of mythology and other mythic-themed stories such as the Prydain Chronicles will have a heyday.<br /><br />Will is very much like he is in \\"Greenwitch\\" -- sometimes he's an ordinary preteen boy who starts yelling \\"Achtung!\\" at the top of his lungs, and sometimes he is the wise and ancient Old One, with knowledge he learned from the book of Gramarye. Bran is an instantly sympathetic character, a very ordinary boy with an extraordinay past; he, like Will in the second book, gradually grows into a unique and more powerful person. Caradog Pritchard will inspire disgust from his first appearance onward, while the tragic Owen Davies will gain the sympathy of the readers despite his insulated life.<br /><br />Perhaps the worst thing about reading \\"Grey King\\" is the knowledge that there is only one more book in this series.

In \\"Good Wives,\\" the second half of the \\"Little Women\\" story (and the second part of an ongoing family saga), Alcott takes her little women out of teenage hijinks and into a darker, more adult place.<br /><br />The book opens with Meg March's wedding to John Brooke -- he's not the wealthy man of her dreams, but he is the man she loves. As Meg learns that it's a struggle to be a poor man's wife, her sisters Jo and Amy are stretching their own wings -- Amy is becoming an accomplished young artist, and Jo is letting \\"genius burn\\" as a published writer. Beth, who has never recovered from her bout of scarlet fever, is still a fragile homebody.<br /><br />Things take an unexpected turn when Aunt March invites Amy to go to Europe with her -- a trip Jo has wanted for years. To make things worse, Beth is in love with Laurie... but then Laurie proposes to Jo. When she rejects him, he storms away to Europe. Jo leaves as well, to be a governess and a writer in the city, but returns home to find Beth slowly wilting away. Tragedy, love and new life will bring the family back together in unexpected ways.<br /><br />It always hurts to grow up, and the events of \\"Good Wives\\" are no exception. It's a much more adult book than the first \\"Little Women,\\" with the girls finding out about love, marriage, careers, artistic attempts and the loss of loved ones. There's plenty of humor -- Jo's disastrous housecalls and Amy's equally disastrous dinner party -- but it's muted.<br /><br />Alcott's  writing, surprisingly, doesn't change much -- it's still funny, weird and highly detailed, but also full of sweetness and pathos. And while the book has some sad endings, the overall feel is that life goes on and things always turn out, if not happily, then for the best -- there are marriages, babies, and new beginnings for everyone. And it ends with a lead-in to the sequel, \\"Little Men,\\" with Jo and Professor Bhaer adopting a bunch of boys as unruly as Jo was.<br /><br />Jo is the same old Jo, with her foot in her mouth and her fierce independence. But she does become more mature and less prickly. Beth is almost a nonentity, wasting away until leaving the book altogether; Meg seems rather ditzy as a housewife, but apparently is shown as a Marmee-in-training. Amy does the best of all, becoming a vivid, funny character almost as likable as Jo.<br /><br />The second part of \\"Little Women\\" is \\"Good Wives\\" -- a very different kind of story about the March girls. But if anything, it's a more beautiful and sweeter one.Jo and Professor Bhaer adopting a bunch of boys as unruly as Jo was.<br /><br />Jo is the same old Jo, with her foot in her mouth and her fierce independence.

Tolkien's best-known children's story is obviously \\"The Hobbit,\\" but that wasn't the only book that he penned for kids. One of them was \\"Mr. Bliss,\\" a charming little picture book with a simple comic plot. Not quite the stuff of classics, but a cute little read with charming illustrations.<br /><br />Mr. Bliss is a man with a love of tall hats, and a Girabbit (sort of a long-necked rabbit with spots) in his garden. One day Mr. Bliss decides (for no apparent reason) to buy a car. He heads off to visit some friends afterwards, only to collide with a wagon of cabbages, end up with several passengers, and be hijacked by three bears named Archie, Bruno and Teddy.<br /><br />Like \\"The Hobbit,\\" this little tale was originally written to entertain Tolkien's children. And though it has an air of whimsy, it was actually based on a real incident: Tolkien's purchase of a car, although presumably he didn't end up being hijacked by teddy bears or any of the other disasters Mr. Bliss has to deal with.<br /><br />Tolkien's little story never really goes much of anywhere -- he's just creating an eventful day for Mr. Bliss because of his new car. His writing here has a sort of warm puckish quality, much like the earlier parts of \\"The Hobbit,\\" though obviously much less realistic and without much detail. As picture book prose goes, it's pretty good.<br /><br />The book also has Tolkien's cute watercolor drawings, which lean heavily on trees and landscapes. What is especially striking is that Tolkien's handwritten writing appears on one side of the page, but it's a bit small and spiky to read easily. So the same words are clearly printed on the opposite pages, in case you can't read Tolkien's handwriting.<br /><br />\\"Mr. Bliss\\" is one of those charming little books that Tolkien wrote for his biggest fans -- his kids. It's no \\"Hobbit\\" or \\"Roverandum,\\" but it is a cute picture book.	2004-11-28

Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real?

Bass makes a stunning debut in \\"Sign of the Qin,\\" the first book of a series drawing on Chinese myth and legend. Taut, lushly written and wonderfully characterized, \\"Sign\\" is an enthralling fantasy with plenty of action, mythic monsters, and a dash of romance and destiny.<br /><br />The emperor is horrified when he sees his newborn son, because the child has the mark of the Qin, a rebel sign, on his cheek. He throws out the child's mother, Silver Lotus, and secretly plots to kill the baby -- especially since the commoners adore him, since they believe he is the new Starlord, who will renounce his noble birth and be their savior. But the Starlord has a nursemaid and rebel allies who will do whatever it takes to keep him safe.<br /><br />A recent volcanic eruption has let all sorts of demons loose on the land, and the evil Lord of the Dead Yamu is also plotting against the Starlord's life, calling out vile shapeshifters and evil harpies. To combat him, the lords of heaven send the incorrigible trickster Monkey to take care of the innocent little boy as he comes closer to his rebel allies.<br /><br />Like a flower, \\"Sign\\" has to unfold slowly and carefully. But Bass makes it worth the while, infusing the story with lots of character development and background information. Chinese legends aren't used very often in fantasy, allowing Bass's story to seem entirely fresh and original, complete with sea dragons and conveniently-placed goddesses.<br /><br />Bass's writing is suitably detailed and solemn, with lots of details on swords, filthy streets and jewelry. The descriptions of things like moving tattoos or statues coming to life are astounding. But there's humor as well; the immortality-hungry Monkey provides most of it, but there is also the putrid demon kappa being defeated with good manners, or the elaborate funeral held for a woman who had only fainted. And most stunning of all are the action scenes, usually quite bloody, gritty and very fast-paced.<br /><br />At first glance, Prince Zong (or \\"little Starlord\\") seems like a pretty typical Child of Destiny -- he walks and talks within days of being born, and has immense wisdom. But Bass makes him a little naive and very sweet. The twin rebels (who are also sons of a sea-dragon) White Streak and Black Whirlwind are also well-drawn. Even the villains like Yamu and the snivelling Emperor are well-written.<br /><br />Bass provides a slow-moving but rich fantasy in \\"Sign of the Qin,\\" and the finale promises more adventures to come.

Sounds like a teenybopper fantasy? That's pretty much the description of \\"Love: A User's Guide,\\" where Clare Naylor tries to make a smarter version of Bridget Jones... and fails miserably.<br /><br />Amy works at Vogue, but in one of the less glamourous jobs -- she dresses anorexic models and fashionistas in the latest styles. She's also mired in her high-school inferiority complex -- she's one of those infuriating characters who are gorgeous, believe themselves to be Quasimodo. Despite this, she has quite a few quickies, including a fling with another woman.<br /><br />Then she meets Orlando Rock, a broodingly handsome celebrity who immediately falls for her. Amy tentatively enters a relationship with him, rife with her own insecurities -- which only gets worse when she sees tabloid pics of his sultry costar smooching him.<br /><br />The only thing that makes an idiot look even more profoundly stupid is when the idiot tries to pass himself off as an intellectual. And Clare Naylor's efforts to create a \\"smart\\" chick-lit fail miserably -- the book comes across as aimless, plodding and hyperdramatic.<br /><br />Naylor obviously had no real plot in mind, beyond celebrity-falls-for-everywoman. The plot wanders around aimlessly, trying to be dramatic over Amy's jealousy or poor gorgeous Orlando being pursued by beautiful women. Naylor even tries to spice it up with a lesbian encounter, but it feels confusingly random. And somebody needs to tell Clare Naylor that it takes more to make a smart character than name-dropping Bronte and Baudelaire.<br /><br />Speaking of which, the greatest flaw of the book is Amy -- a naive, neurotic, brainless mess who believes she is intelligent if she can ramble off a few lines from Shakespeare. A genuinely intelligent woman would be smart enough to not try to flaunt her taste for Bronte on the beach. And Orlando is merely a walking Ken doll who is tailor-made for Amy's neurotic desires.

In this, Susan Cooper kicks off her epic fantasy sequence with doses of Celtic legend, a good vs. evil battle, and a hunt for a mysterious, magical treasure.<br /><br />Simon, Jane and Barney Drew have arrived at their great-uncle Merriman's seaside house for a vacation -- and rapidly become quite bored with the seaside village. But when exploring the attic, they unearth a very, very old map that is somehow connected with the legendary King Arthur. As anyone else would do, the kids begin the search to find a golden grail that is somewhere nearby.<br /><br />But they soon find that they are not the only ones who want the map. A seemingly genial pair of vacationers are being slightly too inquisitive, and someone breaks into Merriman's house in search of the map. And Merriman reveals the origins of the map -- and an ages-old conflict between good and evil that hinges on who finds the grail first.<br /><br />Taken alone, \\"Over Sea Under Stone\\" is a solid, even excellent fantasy story. But it's a little out of sync with the rest of the series. However it  sets excellent groundwork, has an intriguing storyline and a good mix of folklore and Arthuriana, and offers us one of the most mysterious and likable \\"magic mentors,\\" Merriman Lyon. It starts off with every kid's fantasy -- treasure maps and ancient kings -- and rapidly blossoms into something much more.<br /><br />One of the most noticeable differences between this and Cooper's later books is the writing; the writing in her later books becomes much more verbose and descriptive and magical. Here it's quite stark and plain, without a great deal of detail or mystical mind-blowing. \\"Over Sea\\" is mostly very prosaic and very rooted in our world, and many important concepts in the series aren't even touched on.<br /><br />The Drew kids are the sort of siblings that pop up in old E.

Sometimes a hit isn't as good as the second time around. Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series debuted in the slow, ponderous \\"Eye of the World.\\" The follow-up is a bit better, with a slightly better plot and some Machievellian intrigues, but Jordan's mediocre writing and glacial pace turn it into another pulpy mess.<br /><br />Rand and company have arrived at the home of the Aes Sedai, the female sorceresses who now hold his fate in their collective hands -- because he can do magic, albeit by accident, they might \\"gentle\\" him. What he doesn't know is that Moraine and the Aes Sedai leader, the Amyrlin, are secretly plotting to keep him safe -- because they suspect he is the Dragon Reborn.<br /><br />All the Aes Sedai intrigues are interrupted when the stronghold is invaded by trollocs and a Myrdraal -- and a message for Rand is scrawled on the wall in blood. Turns out that they were stealing the legendary Horn of Valere, which can raise dead heroes. So Rand and his friends -- including Mat, whose life is bound to a stolen dagger -- go out in search of the horn.<br /><br />Robert Jordan's books are slow. Really slow. Incredibly slow -- the hero, Rand, spends a hundred pages fretting about something that never happens. He spends an entire chapter getting dressed. Long books -- Dosteyevsky, Tolkien -- are often good things, richly nuanced and full of intricate plotting. But Jordan just seems to be describing everything in detail.<br /><br />The plot itself has promise -- the action scenes tend to be swift, gritty and tense; the idea of a stolen horn that can raise the dead is an intriguing one. But between it is endless pages of quibbling and personal tics, as well as dozens of minor characters who have no bearing on the plot. For example, Jordan introduces countless Aes Sedai, but only two other than Moraine have any plot purpose.<br /><br />Sadly, Jordan's writing isn't up to the challenge -- he reads like a second-rate pulp writer. The force of ultimate evil is called Shai'tan (can't he come up with a better name?), and just stops short of cackling out loud. The characters all interact by flirting or bickering, usually with women expressing disdain for the men. Jordan devotes a great deal of attention to the jewelry and clothing of the characters, even devoting a paragraph to a piece of Moraine's jewelry.<br /><br />The characters are more like a collection of tics and personality flaws than actual people -- Rand spends all his time worrying, but breaks out long enough to be a hero. Nynaeve and Egwene pull their hair and snipe, while Perrin feels inferior and Mat flirts. Of all the characters, Moraine is the only one who comes across as a person, especially since she keeps most of her plans to herself.<br /><br />\\"The Great Hunt\\" is one of those fantasy books that could have been quite good if about three hundred pages had been whittled out of it.

Tolkien	Books	4	14	14	N	N	Masterful "Middle-Earth"	Countless scholars and quite a few amateurs have tried to dissect the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. Most do a rotten job. But Paul Kocher actually does it well -- while his essays are a bit outdated, \\"Master of Middle-Earth : The Fiction of J.R.R. Tolkien\\" still stand as some of the best interpretations of Tolkien's work.<br /><br />Kocher tackles such subjects as whether Middle-Earth is really an imaginary world, or one tied closely to reality, followed by a critical look at \\"The Hobbit\\" and how it related -- or doesn't -- to \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" One of the most intriguing essays in here is \\"Cosmic Order,\\" a look at how Tolkien portrays free will, predestination and fate, followed by a study of how Tolkien writes Sauron and the other evil creatures of Middle-Earth, such as orcs (which Kocher thinks are trained to be evil) and barrow wights.<br /><br />Kocher then does a 180 and looks at the free peoples of Middle-Earth, and the importance of each race. A careful study of Aragorn follows, tracing the uncrowned king's subtle development over the entire trilogy and studying his status as a hero. As a grand finale, Kocher examines various short works that Tolkien wrote or translated, including the lesser known creations like \\"Imram.\\"<br /><br />Most people who analyze \\"Lord of the Rings\\" end up like that guy in Nabokov's \\"Pale Fire\\" -- they see only what they want to see. But Paul H. Kocher, who was a professor at Stanford, does a very good job of analyzing \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" Certainly nothing has been put out that disproves him.<br /><br />Kocher obviously had a great deal of respect for Tolkien, even speaking with intense scorn about people who dismiss \\"Lord of the Rings\\" as \\"just an adventure story.\\" But he doesn't pull his punches due to that respect -- he's about as honest as he can be when he doesn't like something, such as the cockney-speaking Trolls.<br /><br />Kocher's essays are somewhat out of date, since they were written in the 1970s, long before the \\"Unfinished Tales\\" book was published, and it only dips into the \\"Silmarillion.\\" But at the same time, his essays are thoughtful and in tune with Tolkien's trilogy, and stick closely to Tolkien's Christian beliefs and his mythic influences.<br /><br />\\"Master of Middle-Earth : The Fiction of J.R.R.

And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.   <br />   <br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.   <br />   <br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement.	2004-11-26

Their unusual courtship and often hilarious marriage is chronicled in \\"My Heart Lies South: The Story of my Mexican Marriage,\\" a story of clashing cultures and hysterical family.<br /><br />She first met her husband Luis in a hotel lobby, while on a writing assignment. After courting her with love songs in a taxi, Elizabeth Borton ended up going home with him to meet his rambuctious family and adoring parents, who approve of the young American \\"mees\\" as Luis's future wife. Suddenly Borton found herself living in Mexico -- but with a lot to learn.<br /><br />At first, Elizabeth struggles to deal with the cultural barriers and how she is being snubbed by the neighbors. But soon she adjusts to her new life, and runs into an ultra-religious cook, troubles with the legality of her marriage, a playboy in-law who falls madly in love with a very proper girl, and finding out how much fun it is to be pregnant in Mexico.<br /><br />Surprisingly, \\"My Heart Lies South\\" is not just an autobiography about Borton de Trevino's \\"Mexican marriage.\\" It's also a portrait of 1930s Mexico, which was very different from anywhere in the United States -- a place solidly entrenched in old traditions. It wasn't backward. They just did not see any reason to change things like the \\"Tia\\" aunts who care for a whole family.<br /><br />Borton's brisk writing goes pretty quickly, telling stories of young Romeo-and-Juliet lovers, authentic Mexican food and getting drunk in front of her husband's clients. She's funny and self-deprecating, not to mention unafraid of telling the world when she committed some social sin. It's almost like a sitcom, except it was all real.<br /><br />Perhaps the most endearing thing she shows us is Luis's family -- a sprawling, warm bunch of people who immediately take her under their wings. Particularly likable is Luis's mother Mamacita, and her playboy brother-in-law Roberto. But Borton de Trevino brings everyone to life, right down to the eccentric cooks and kindly judges.<br /><br />\\"My Heart Lies South: The Story of My Mexican Marriage\\" is a thoroughly charming look back in time, where an American woman clashes with Mexican traditions. The results are funny and heartwarming.rticularly likable is Luis's mother Mamacita, and her playboy brother-in-law Roberto.

Unfortunately, J.E.A. Taylor's \\"Complete Tolkien Companion\\" is far from invaluable. With barely any details and seriously unbalanced data, Taylor's book is all right as a second or third choice, but a flop as a serious guide.<br /><br />From A (\\"Accursed Years\\") to Z (\\"Zirak-Zigil\\"), this book covers people, places, battles, objects and events from all throughout Middle-Earth's history. Taylor includes information from Tolkien's famous \\"Hobbit\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" as well as the Silmarillion, \\"Unfinished Tales,\\" and some other books. (Unfortunately, he doesn't include all of the history books)<br /><br />Is \\"The Complete Tolkien Companion\\" worthless as an encyclopedia? No, not at all -- it's useful for some quick glances, and Taylor has a pleasant if clumsy style. But as a serious source, it fails. It doesn't have enough information, and what it does have is unbalanced and weirdly conveyed.<br /><br />One of the most annoying things is that while Tyler will tell some stuff about various characters, events, and items. But in most entries, he doesn't specify which books they appeared in, what pages, or much else. Where is \\"Khuzdul\\" revealed to be a secret language? He doesn't tell you. And his handling of the information is clumsy: readers are told that Arwen Evenstar shares the \\"Doom of Luthien.\\" What does Luthien have to do with her descendent becoming a mortal? Taylor doesn't say.<br /><br />What's more, Taylor demonstrates a weird tendency to act like the events of Tolkien's books are a 10,000-year-old history. He claims in his preciously-worded foreword that he's going to stop, but he doesn't -- a tendency that crosses the line from fervently geeky to unsettling. What is more, he has a tendency to interject his own opinions into the text: he spends a long time explaining how misunderstood Galadriel is, for example.<br /><br />To very casual fans, \\"The Complete Tolkien Companion\\" might have some worth. But for those seeking more information about Tolkien's Middle-Earth, this is an unworthy choice, in the shadow of Robert Foster's accomplished \\"Complete Guide to Middle-Earth.\\"Tolkien Companion\\" might have some worth.

While these are found elsewhere, such as in the \\"Tolkien Reader,\\" it's a pleasant way to pass an afternoon, taking in everything from translations to humor to poetry.<br /><br />\\"Farmer Giles\\" is about a rather unusual farmer called on to defeat a rather easy-to-defeat dragon, after dealing with a deaf and blind giant. This is definitely a light, fluffy, funny story, while retaining Tolkien's scholarly, tongue-in-cheek edge. \\"Smith of Wootton Major\\" is the beautiful tale of a boy who eats a magical treasure hidden in a cake, and becomes enmeshed in a search for an elf king.<br /><br />\\"Leaf by Niggle\\" ius more for the analytical thinkers among Tolkien's fans. \\"Leaf\\" is something of a glimpse into Tolkien's own soul, concerning his work and his own mortality. On a similarly intellectual note, the collection includes Tolkien's translation of \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,\\" a classic Arthurian story.<br /><br />We then lapse into entirely different material. There is a long poem called \\"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil,\\" written in the style and meter of his songs about himself in LOTR, when he meets the hobbits. It explains a little more about the hearty Maia and his wife Goldberry, as does the second of the poems, \\"Bombadil Goes Boating.\\" There are also several other poems -- some simple and cute, some dramatic and complex -- supposedly written by hobbits.<br /><br />Anyone reading \\"A Tolkien Miscellany\\" will probably be surprised -- this has every kind of writing a fan could imagine the master of Middle-Earth doing. While \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is a classic, it's interesting to see Tolkien stretching his limits in these shorter works.<br /><br />His translation of Gawain is probably the stuffiest thing here, although it's much more readable than most translations. Elsewhere, his work sparkles with beautiful descriptions -- like the faerie descriptions in \\"Smith of Wootton Major\\" -- and warm, almost playful verse. Tolkien even gets to take the sense of humor that is hinted at in his Middle-Earth books, and lets it run wild in \\"Farmer Giles of Ham.\\"<br /><br />While none of these have the scope and brilliance of Tolkien's larger works, \\"A Tolkien Miscellany\\" is an entertaining collection of the professor's shorter works.ions in \\"Smith of Wootton Major\\" -- and warm, almost playful verse.

Recently rereleased is \\"Buried Fire,\\" a simple but well-written fantasy adventure, with a dark lesson about arrogance and power.<br /><br />In a small English village, a boy named Michael fall asleep on a hillside, and is consumed by the thoughts of a sleeping dragon deep underground. Elsewhere in the town, workmen come across a strange Celtic cross buried in the church's foundation -- with a dragon on it. Then Michael staggers home, suffering a strange fever and a drug-like high -- and claiming he can see INSIDE people. Unsurprisingly, the stodgy vicar Tom thinks he's on acid.<br /><br />But when his brother Stephen follows Michael to the spot where he slept, he's given the same strange powers. At the same time, Tom. The boys have no time to savor their powers, because they are not the only ones who have them -- and the other people in the village who have the four gifts of the dragon are using them to try to bring the dragon back. Now Stephen and Tom may be the only ones to stop them -- and to save Michael from becoming one of them.<br /><br />They say that power corrupts, and it corrupts quite a bit in \\"Buried Fire,\\" where the magic and action literally starts on the first page. Stroud lightly sprinkles his story of ancient dragons and magic with a bit of old folklore, and carefully crafts a back-history for the mysterious \\"witches\\" that surround the dragon's influence.<br /><br />\\"Buried Fire\\" starts slow, and takes some time to really get moving beyond Michael's strange powers. The ending, on the other hand, is extremely abrupt -- how about another chapter or two to round things out? But Stroud has a good prose style: detailed, rich and very intense. Particularly imaginative is the first power -- the \\"sight\\" -- and how it allows Michael and Steven to see the kind of souls that people have. This could have turned out silly, but Stroud adds an otherworldly feel to it.<br /><br />Michael seems to be the lead at first, but later he shares the stage with his brother Stephen, who is not as powerful, but is not corrupted by the malevolent Mr. Cleever. Both are strong characters, with Michael falling victim to a longing for power and dominance, and Stephen desperately trying to save his brother. And the villains are all the more sinister because the dragon's thoughts seem to be warping them.<br /><br />Think you knew dragons? Think again.

Barron has said that writing this book spurred him to begin his epic \\"Lost Year of Merlin\\" saga. That said, \\"The Merlin Effect\\" is a book that is only similar to his high fantasy series because of... well, Merlin. The old wizard is only one source of magic and mystery in Barron's third entrancing novel.<br /><br />Kate Gordon has been tooling around around near her dad's research vehicles in Baja, California. Her father, Jim, has come there determined to prove the validity of the ancient sunken ship, the Resurreccion, and the fabled horn of Merlin that it contains. The Horn of Merlin, the Serilliant, was once filled with a mer-king's gift: the gift of forever remaining young. And the \\"Ballad of the Resurreccion\\" mentions this horn.<br /><br />Now Jim, Isabella and Terry, a marine biologist and an obnoxious sonar expert, are finding some very strange things in the vicinity of an enormous, never-ending whirlpool. When they set out to find out more about the whirlpool, Kate finds herself on the Resureccion -- with a strange old monk who has lived down there, kept alive by the presence of the horn. Now they must find the horn, and battle the evil enchantress Nimue, before a rupture in the ocean floor destroys all of them...<br /><br />T.A. Barron has made a reputation for himself with his lush, imaginative fantasies laced with little bits of myth and legend. And \\"Merlin Effect\\" shows how he can take even seemingly silly ideas -- the horn of Merlin on an old Spanish ship? -- and make them plausible fantasy plots. He also gives a few new twists on Arthurian legend, bringing the character of Merlin forward in time without silly gimmicks.<br /><br />Barron's writing is typically lush here, with ornate descriptions of the California shoreline and the strange, eerie interior of the shipwrecked Resureccion (an apt name for the ship, considering the horn's effect). He makes the story come alive with little details, sounds and smells and colors; the message of the book is in the true effect of the horn, which will come as something of a surprise. And little tidbits of real Celtic legend are woven in, such as the various treasures at the climax.<br /><br />Thankfully, Barron doesn't \\"wise-up\\" Kate to the point that she seems unreal. Rather, she seems like a teenager who has seen and experienced too much to not be intrigued by the strange and surreal. Merlin himself is pretty easy to spot, but the way he fakes doddering eccentricity is amusing to read. Even the malicious Nimue is given a bit of extra dimension, when Merlin reveals that once she was good and selfless.<br /><br />T.A.

And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.<br /><br />Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).<br /><br />So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.<br /><br />Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" --  especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.<br /><br />The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter -- each is given his own quirks and strengths.<br /><br />With the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie trilogy solidly entrenched in pop culture, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" is now receiving a well-deserved boost of attention.

It's an imaginative series with a richly epic bent, but his writing is too stiff and undescriptive to do it justice.<br /><br />\\"The Wind Singer\\" introduces us to the city of Amaranth, a rigid and ambitious civilization where everyone is constantly given tests, so they can advance higher in their society. But their world is turned on its ear when Bowman and Kestrel Hath escape from the city with the simpleminded Mumpo. The children are determined to find the voice of the ancient Wind Singer, in the hopes that it can restore life to their city. But they will have to face the evil Morah and its unstoppable army as well...<br /><br />\\"The Slaves of the Mastery\\" is darker than its predecessor -- though the Morah has been defeated, the people of Amaranth are still in trouble. They are attacked and enslaved by the forces of the Master, and the twins are separated -- Bo is in slavery, while the fiery Kestrel is seeking revenge on the Master and his people. But even if the twins find one another again, their experiences and the prophecies of their mother may still disrupt their lives...<br /><br />\\"Firesong\\" brings the story to its finale, as the Manth people are journeying to their new land, led by the twins' mother Ira. Unfortunately, Ira's powers are slowly killing her. What is more, Bo has fallen in love with a beautiful princess, Sisi, but also believes that he the Singer people will call him -- and that he will be called on to destroy the threat to the Manth people, but die as well.<br /><br />The Wind on Fire trilogy has all the qualities of an epic series, starting off with a simplistic story about children on a quest, but turning into the story of a civilization's migration and rebirth. And as a bonus touch, Nicholson successfully imbues the story with philosophy and moral questions that have no clear answers.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while Nicholson can create an epic story, he can't bring it to life. His career as a screenwriter becomes painfully clear in scenes that need description, but don't have it. He can describe scenes in detail, but more often than not, he doesn't make the readers experience the sounds, smells and sights -- he just tells what the characters are experiencing.<br /><br />Kestrel and Bo are the most well-written characters of the series, as a pair of twins who have a psychic connection. Kestrel is written as a fiery rebel, while her brother is quieter, and more angst-ridden. Not many of the supporting characters are fleshed out, though, especially some enemies like the Morah, who are just bad bad bad.<br /><br />The Wind on Fire trilogy has a lot of epic qualities, but thanks to script-like writing, it never quite starts to burn.

Together, their \\"Maps of Tolkien's Middle-Earth\\" is a solid release that adds an extra dimension to ordinary maps.<br /><br />Howe presents four fold-out maps of Middle-Earth: Wilderland, the areas traversed by Bilbo Baggins in \\"The Hobbit,\\" a general map of Middle-Earth, a map of Beleriand and other lands of the north, and the land of Numenor. The latter two haven't been released in this country, which makes them especially interesting.<br /><br />Admittedly, the maps aren't too detailed or intricate; they seem rather basic. But Howe hasn't just drawn colorful maps -- he surrounds the maps with his exquisite illustrations of trees and hills, castles, Bilbo and the Dwarves at Bag End, Gandalf on Shadowfax, the seashore and mountains. With Howe's intricate, Celtic-looking borders separating the illustrations from the maps, each poster takes on almost the look of a medieval tapestry.<br /><br />The foldout poster-maps are exceptional on their own. But Brian Sibley's accompanying guide is almost as good -- he has a separate section for each map that details the various cities, mountains, and other important points. What's more, Sibley details the history of each map in Tolkien's life, and the importance of that part of Middle-Earth in his ongoing story. Sibley's essays are well-written and interesting, and his descriptions of the locations in Middle-Earth is quite well done.<br /><br />Don't expect something too earth-shattering -- \\"Maps of Tolkien's Middle-Earth\\" is precisely what the title implies. It's map posters, accompanied by an insightful guide book. Both are well-done and masterfully illustrated, especially Howe's accompanying illustrations in Sibley's book (both rougher black-and-white pictures, and polished color paintings).

Tolkien in \\"Tolkien and Lord of the Rings: A Guide to Middle-Earth.\\" While those who have read Tolkien's assorted books won't find anything new, it's a good introduction to his books for new readers, and a good \\"refresher course\\" for those who haven't read them in awhile.<br /><br />Duriez starts off by introducing the book, describing his reasons for writing it. Then he speeds off into a mini-bio about Tolkien's life, followed by a dissection of the work he did, and its place in his life. And, since Duriez has written a book about literary club the Inklings, he includes quite a bit about Tolkien's friendships and relationships. For further clarification, Duriez includes a very brief timeline.<br /><br />Then Duriez summarizes the entire plots of \\"The Hobbit\\" and the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, followed by a book-by-book chronology, and an informative chapter on the content of the \\"Silmarillion,\\" and its connections to the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" books. Then he follows up with three A-Z guides -- one to things and people in Middle-Earth, then to themes and concepts in his work (eagles, allegory, theology, quests and so on), and the people and places in his life, such as his family, his friends, the mill he played at as a boy, and the books that influenced his writing. Finally there is a list of summaries, of various books that he wrote.<br /><br />Duriez has certainly done his research -- he seems very comfortable talking about Middle-Earth, and easily quotes everyone from Peter Jackson to Tolkien himself. What's more, he obviously has a deep respect for Tolkien, and an appreciation for the richness and depth of Tolkien's work. For just about anybody writing this sort of book, that's a must.<br /><br />What does it not contain? Well, Duriez admits himself in the preface that it's not meant to be in-depth, and Tolkien fans won't come away with anything they don't already know.

But to marry Joe, she gave up her dreams of kids and a cottage in the country, and remade her body and attitude just to please him. She tries to convince herself that this is a glorious life -- and also tries to believe that Joe, a notorious womanizer, isn't operating under the credo \\"what she doesn't know won't hurt her.\\"<br /><br />But when someone walks in on Joe with his coworker/girlfriend Josie, he finds himself unceremoniously transferred to New York. He and Alice also purchase a small, run-down cottage in the country, which Alice fixes up according to her tastes. Though Joe has vowed to remain faithful, he doesn't like Alice when she is happy, relaxed and dressed in jeans, rather than a docile trophy wife. And now that Alice has found her \\"soul home,\\" she finds a strength she never knew she had.<br /><br />Infidelity is a pretty touchy subject, but Green's tactic of taking on several POVs is what makes \\"To Have and To Hold\\" so good. She takes a look at the various kinds of attraction -- the thrill-based kind, the flirty-only kind, and the true-love kind -- and offers a few subtle insights into what makes a relationship bomb and what makes it work.<br /><br />Green's writing is pretty ordinary, but she has a knack for making convincing characters. She lets the plot unfold slowly, letting the problems and tension unfold, as we find out more about Alice. Green's picture of the urban surroundings is glittery but lifeless, while the New England countryside is warm and cozy -- just as it is meant to be.<br /><br />It's a bit hard to connect with Alice at first -- she's so timid that she changes everything about herself to please her husband. But when she gets her country cottage -- which, we learn, once belonged to a woman who suffered her husband's affairs for years -- we get to see her blossom. It's all the more satisfying, since she was so weak before. And Green dips into the minds of the other characters and giving them motivations, such as the caddish Joe and \\"other woman\\" Josie.<br /><br />Relationships -- good and bad -- sit at the heart of \\"To Have and To Hold,\\" a book that could easily have been called \\"In Glamour or in Jeans.\\" An enlightening bit of high-end chick-lit.ant to be. <br /> <br />It's a bit hard to connect with Alice at first -- she's so timid that she changes everything about herself to please her husband.

Barron has said that writing this book spurred him to begin his epic \\"Lost Year of Merlin\\" saga. That said, \\"The Merlin Effect\\" is a book that is only similar to his high fantasy series because of... well, Merlin. The old wizard is only one source of magic and mystery in Barron's third entrancing novel.<br /><br />Kate Gordon has been tooling around around near her dad's research vehicles in Baja, California. Her father, Jim, has come there determined to prove the validity of the ancient sunken ship, the Resurreccion, and the fabled horn of Merlin that it contains. The Horn of Merlin, the Serilliant, was once filled with a mer-king's gift: the gift of forever remaining young. And the \\"Ballad of the Resurreccion\\" mentions this horn.<br /><br />Now Jim, Isabella and Terry, a marine biologist and an obnoxious sonar expert, are finding some very strange things in the vicinity of an enormous, never-ending whirlpool. When they set out to find out more about the whirlpool, Kate finds herself on the Resureccion -- with a strange old monk who has lived down there, kept alive by the presence of the horn. Now they must find the horn, and battle the evil enchantress Nimue, before a rupture in the ocean floor destroys all of them...<br /><br />T.A. Barron has made a reputation for himself with his lush, imaginative fantasies laced with little bits of myth and legend. And \\"Merlin Effect\\" shows how he can take even seemingly silly ideas -- the horn of Merlin on an old Spanish ship? -- and make them plausible fantasy plots. He also gives a few new twists on Arthurian legend, bringing the character of Merlin forward in time without silly gimmicks.<br /><br />Barron's writing is typically lush here, with ornate descriptions of the California shoreline and the strange, eerie interior of the shipwrecked Resureccion (an apt name for the ship, considering the horn's effect). He makes the story come alive with little details, sounds and smells and colors; the message of the book is in the true effect of the horn, which will come as something of a surprise. And little tidbits of real Celtic legend are woven in, such as the various treasures at the climax.<br /><br />Thankfully, Barron doesn't \\"wise-up\\" Kate to the point that she seems unreal. Rather, she seems like a teenager who has seen and experienced too much to not be intrigued by the strange and surreal. Merlin himself is pretty easy to spot, but the way he fakes doddering eccentricity is amusing to read. Even the malicious Nimue is given a bit of extra dimension, when Merlin reveals that once she was good and selfless.<br /><br />T.A.

She has two sisters, the beautiful Hope and Grace, and a benevolent, wealthy father. Then all their lives change suddenly: the ships their father owns are lost, and the money goes with them. One of the sisters marries a poor but worthy country lad, while the other lost her beloved fiancee who captained one of the ships. After selling their possessions the family moves to the countryside.<br /><br />The father leaves on a trip -- and returns with a single rose, a gift for Beauty, which carries the price of either his life or his daughter. Beauty leaves to go live at the castle of the mysterious Beast, with only her plowhorse to accompany her. She arrives at a castle of invisible servants, magical books, friendly animals, and a melancholy Beast who asks her to marry him every evening...<br /><br />There is nothing new in fairy tale retellings now, but when McKinley first wrote \\"Beauty,\\" it was a relative rarity. And even now, few of them are as intelligently written and have such solid heroines. Rather than giving her story a contrived \\"twist,\\" McKinley merely fleshes out the storyline and gives the characters personalities.<br /><br />The writing is excellent; McKinley writes the more prosaic passages of cottage life and the surrounding friendly village, as well as the more dreamlike, fantastical scenes in the Beast's castle. Lots of atmosphere, either in the poor but warm surroundings of the house, or the eerie feel of the castle.The dialogue is nearly flawless: McKinley doesn't write ye-olde-formal prose, but the characters never sound -- or think -- like modern Americans.<br /><br />Beauty is a great heroine -- brainy, kind, wry-humored, brave and strong. Though the \\"Beauty\\" element is discarded, it is done so with the apparent understanding that this \\"Beauty\\" has brains and guts rather than a pretty face. The Beast himself is a little more shadowy; we never get inside his head the way we do Beauty's, but then the book is hers, not his. Beauty's father and sisters are equally well-done, avoiding the cliches of nastiness in favor of being likable or haunted.<br /><br />Robin McKinley's debut \\"Beauty\\" is still among the best-loved fairy-tale retellings.

Between mysterious flying beasts and pirate attacks, Oppel gives readers a glimpse of life aboard an airship... if airships, not planes, were the major way to travel.<br /><br />Matt Cruse is on the crow's nest, as the \\"ship's eyes,\\" when he catches a glimpse of a sinking airship. The dying balloonist dies shortly afterward -- but not before telling Matt about glorious winged creatures. Matt dismisses these as hallucinations -- but one year later, a routine cruise on the airship Aurora becomes something more when the dead man's granddaughter Kate arrives. Wealthy but treated like a nuisance, Kate is determined to find whatever her grandfather saw.<br /><br />She shows Matt her grandfather's writings about these winged creatures, and Matt is slowly convinced that the old man wasn't just hallucinating. But their investigations are interrupted by a sudden pirate attack -- which leaves the Aurora sinking from a rip in its envelope. Soon the airship and her crew and passengers are stranded on a deserted island, which may hold the secret to Kate's winged beasts... but it also holds the pirates.<br /><br />Oppel really hits his stride in this book, mixing science with science fiction and wrapping it in a fantasy tortilla. While his bat books were quite good, \\"Airborn\\" has the rare quality of slipping readers into his imagined universe. It's one of those stories that can be easily imagined as a reality, even if we do have planes and not airships. He even describes how creatures like the cloud cats could fly, were they real.<br /><br />After the initial rescue, which gets readers hooked into the story, Oppel takes his time to unfold the plot, described in careful detail and with plenty of rich skyborne atmosphere. His setting seems to be, like Hayao Miyazaki's \\"Castle in the Sky,\\" a mix of old and new -- while it's full of airships and similar technology, the attitudes seem to be that of the Victorian or Edwardian era.<br /><br />The pre-pirate plot is a bit slow, but very necessary -- Oppel introduces readers to the Aurora, her chummy crew, and the rich passengers they ferry over the ocean. It also gives Kate and Matt time to get to know each other -- for real, not merely \\"we're two teens in the same place, we're friends! And maybe more someday!\\"<br /><br />Speaking of Matt and Kate, they are definitely good lead characters. Matt is \\"airborn,\\" a kid born in an airship and now at home nowhere except in the sky, even though his father died there. Kate is a good counterpoint, since she is everything Matt is not -- wealthy, adventurous, and all too willing to let people know when she is frustrated. The supporting characters, from the prissy chaperone to the genial captain, are also well-drawn; the only exception is rich boy Bruce, who doesn't get much time.<br /><br />Reportedly he is working on a sequel, which is not surprising.

But a mysterious traveller joins them on their journey -- and soon Moril's father is murdered, his brother is jailed, and his sister is enmeshed in a conspiracy involving the Duke's son. Now Moril must find a way to save his family, using a magical cwidder.<br /><br />\\"In \\"Drowned Ammet,\\" the impoverished Alhammitt (called \\"Mitt\\") has become a radical of sorts, after his father and mother are tossed out because of an evil duke. Later, the Free Holanders also take his father. Mitt is determined to get revenge, but his years of planning go awry, and he ends up desperately fleeing to the North with two captives... only to encounter storms, gods, and much more.<br /><br />Jones is best known for a sort of wry, homey fantasy with a British flavor -- not to mention that they often have dapper wizards. That sort of stuff is mostly missing in \\"The Dalemark Quartet Volume 1.\\" Instead, we get a darker, much more epic story -- there are godlike figures, earldoms, peasants, nobles, and plenty more.<br /><br />Jones' writing is quite detailed in this book, since she not only describes the clothing, woods and people, but also the alternative world of Dalemark. Both stories are connected, but independent, and Jones carefully crafts the politics and conflicts that run under all the magic and the godlike Undying. Certainly not many authors can make an invented world that is simple, yet realistic.<br /><br />Her heroes are also very realistic -- Moril is the kid who makes origami cranes instead of doing his math test. Smart, but daydreamy, and only murder and conspiracies wake him up. Mitt is entirely different, focused on revenge and getting more desperate every day, but learning about himself after he ends up adrift.<br /><br />The first two books of the Dalemark Quartet are included in this two-pack, a pair of solid fantasies that will leave readers wanting to check out the third and fourth books.

Dipping into surrealism and imbued with spirituality, his poetry is compiled into \\"The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens,\\" which includes seven compilations of his work.<br /><br />Over his lifetime, Stevens wrote several books of poetry, but his exquisite poems are best taken by themselves: the lush grandeur of \\"Sunday Morning,\\" the hymnlike \\"Le Monocle De Mon Oncle,\\" and the humid grittiness of \\"O Florida, Venereal Soil.\\" He takes multiple looks at \\"Thirteen Ways of Looking At A Blackbird,\\" and the lush \\"Six Significant Landscapes.\\"<br /><br />In other poems, Stevens dips into outright surrealism, like in the delicate \\"Tattoo\\" (\\"There are filaments of your eyes/On the surface of the water/And in the edges of the snow\\"), and also adds a meditative bent into \\"The Snow Man\\" (\\"For the listener, who listens in the snow,/And, nothing himself, beholds/Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is\\").<br /><br />If nothing else, Stevens' poetry can be read just because it is exquisitely beautiful. He lavished details all over almost every poem he wrote, and gave many of them the quality of a dream. His descriptions are simply written, but brilliantly laid out: \\"When my dream was near the moon,/The white folds of its gown/Filled with yellow light.\\"<br /><br />His style tends to be a bit on the ornate side -- Stevens freely uses the more exotic terms -- such as \\"opalescence,\\" \\"pendentives\\" and \\"muleteers\\" -- wrapped up in complex verse, sometimes with a rhyme scheme and sometimes free-form. And lush detail is added to many of his poems, with descriptions of the moon, sun, plants and lighting, along with dazzling descriptions of the colors.<br /><br />But his writing is more than beautiful. Stevens' work often poses questions about death, life, religion, and art, taking the conventional and turning it on its head. His belief in the importance of his art is reflected in poems like \\"Not Ideas About The Thing But The Thing Itself,\\" which ends with the portentous lines: \\"Surrounded by its choral rings,/Still far away. It was like/A new knowledge of reality.\\"<br /><br />Wallace Stevens is one of the most unique poets of the 20th century, and the sprawling \\"Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens\\" is a wonderful read.cted in poems like \\"Not Ideas About The Thing But The Thing Itself,\\" which ends with the portentous lines: \\"Surrounded by its choral rings,/Still far away.

Independent of the first book \\"Over Sea Under Stone,\\" this is also darker, more magical, more intense, and one of the most beautifully written fantasy novels in existance.<br /><br />Will Stanton is an ordinary boy, until his Midwinter eleventh birthday. On that day, he ventures out into a seemingly changed world. There, he encounters a sinister Dark Rider, then a beautiful white horse that leads him to a hidden place, where he finds two of the Old Ones -- the mysterious Lady and Merriman Lyon, one of the stars of the previous book. The Old Ones are immortal, powerful, wise, and it turns out that Will is the last one born.<br /><br />And as an astonishingly cold winter settles over England, Will is taught some of the ways of the Old Ones, who fight the Dark (forces of evil, like the Dark Rider). He has one of the signs of power, but must get them all: Iron, Bronze, Stone, Wood, Fire and Water. And he must contend with the Dark Rider, his own failings, and a mysterious stranger whose future is inextricably entwined with his...<br /><br />Susan Cooper is at her peak here. Will Stanton's adventures have a sense of unreal mystery and magic about them, where the slightest actions can have significance, time is easily manipulated, and two kinds of reality intersect. Welsh mythos and legend is interwoven more deeply here, including hints of the Arthurian tilt that was featured more prominently in \\"Over Sea, Under Stone.\\" At the same time, Cooper accurately displays a more human side of Will, the side that is deeply attached to his family and home.<br /><br />Her writing also becomes much more detailed here. In her first Dark is Rising novel, Cooper's writing was relatively spare and lacking in detail. Here, she more than makes up for it with intricate details about the halls of the Old Ones, the bustling farmhouse, and the eerie woods where the Walker wanders.<br /><br />Nowhere to be found is the British-kids-on-holiday atmosphere. It's replaced by an warm atmosphere, and one of shocking, powerful magic. This isn't magic infringing on our world, but rather Will stepping from one to another. Her dialogue is more believable, even the little old lady bleating about the snowstorm; and Will tends to think, act, and talk like an eleven-year-old boy who is aged before his time.<br /><br />Will himself is an astonishingly three-dimensional character: he flips between being a smart, quiet eleven-year-old to being an Old One, with all the power that suggests. This transition is not one that is handled lightly, as he gradually loses his innocent, boyish outlook and learns more about the battle between evil and good. Merriman Lyon is a more majestic character than in \\"Over Sea, Under Stone,\\" and the reader gets a saddening view of the sacrifices he's had to make for his battle against the Dark.<br /><br />Susan Cooper does an astonishing job with \\"The Dark is Rising,\\" a spellbinding fantasy that secured the Dark is Rising Sequence as a classic.

That problem fuels \\"Parnassus on Wheels,\\" a sweet little story about books and an unlikely romance, between a quirky bookseller and a stodgy spinster.<br /><br />Andrew McGill became an unexpected literary hit when he wrote a book called \\"Paradise Regained\\" about a farmer's rural life. For his second book, he went trudging around the countryside for more material, leaving his middle-aged sister Helen to stay home and keep house for him. But one day a strange little man arrives at Helen's home, in a bookshop on wheels. The odd Roger Mifflin wants to sell Andrew his Parnassus -- his portable bookshop -- and intends to wait until Andrew returns.<br /><br />Desperate to keep her brother from vanishing into the sunset, Helen takes her savings and buys the Parnassus herself. Then, out of regret for the life she has never gotten to experience off the farm, Helen decides to spend some time driving the Parnassus around the countryside. And as Roger teaches her about books and their importance, she begins to see just how a book -- any book -- can change a person's life.<br /><br />\\"Parnassus on Wheels\\" is not a really outstanding book, but it is charming and sometimes very funny. Christopher Morley gives a glimpse into an earlier era, when rural areas didn't have libraries, there was no Internet to show people what was for sale, and a lot of people read nothing but the Bible.<br /><br />There really isn't much of a plot, since most of it consists of Roger and Helen puttering around the countryside in the Parnassus. If there is a plot at all, it's the sort-of-romance between the two of them. It's cute and slightly sentimental, but peppered with humor such as Andrew and Roger getting into a very undignified fistfight in the road.<br /><br />Helen starts out as a rather annoying character -- she's prejudiced against people who read, and seems to think that people should simply stay on the farm. That makes it all the more enjoyable when she starts appreciating the written word, and decides that she's not going to be an unappreciated bread-making automaton anymore. Roger Mifflin is actually not as odd as he seems to Helen's eyes, although he does have some charming quirks.<br /><br />\\"Parnassus on Wheels\\" isn't deep or detailed enough to really be a classic, but it is a charming little early-1900s novel.

She was brought there at an early age to be the companion to daughter Amy. Edith's humility and goodness make her a favorite in that place, except to a relative of Lady Hamilton's, Ida Clare. Ida is not wealthy, though she is an aristocrat, and (by the standards of the day) is aging to old-maid-hood.<br /><br />Things change drastically with the arrival of Lord Percy, a pal of Amy's brother Arthur. Despite Percy's broken heart, he begins to fall in love with Edith -- except Ida is determined to have him for herself. Around the time Edith nobly rejects her suitor (because they aren't on the same social level), a series of thefts are committed -- and she is the main suspect.<br /><br />It's not hard to see why Alcott buried this novel in a trunk -- by the time she was a serious writer, it would have been painful to have people read this book. It's drips with gooey sentimentality and quite a few romantic cliches of the time -- the secret legacy, the rigid class system (where lowly peasants adore the nobility), the tragic secrets, the nasty nemesis who never does anything really evil, and the backdrops that are uniformly beautiful and majestic.<br /><br />While Alcott's writing at this point was also quite cliched, it's also quite pretty. Assuming that you don't start rolling your eyes at the idea of a moonlit half-castle-half-mansion surrounded by green fields and a lake, that is. But once a bit of disbelief is suspended, the writing does seem quite lovely. The dialogue, however, is ridiculously ornate and self-deprecating.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Alcott stumbles all over herself when she writes the characters -- Edith is a revoltingly sweet wilting lily, as well as being one of those people whose humility becomes almost a personality defect. She has no flaws, just virtues -- she's beautiful, swoons, and sings like an angel. She even takes soup to the sick. Lord Percy is not much better -- virtuous, sensitive, tragic, and utterly dull. And the flat supporting characters all serve merely to gush about how sweet and lovely Edith is, except for the tepidly malicious Ida.<br /><br />Though it was later remade into a solid TV movie, \\"The Inheritance\\" is one of those very few Louisa May Alcott stories that deserves to have stayed buried. It has none of the charm of \\"Little Women,\\" nor the cliched but well-written thrills of \\"Long Fatal Love Chase.\\" Revoltingly sweet and cliched, this reads almost like a parody of the romantic genre.usly ornate and self-deprecating.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Alcott stumbles all over herself when she writes the characters -- Edith is a revoltingly sweet wilting lily, as well as being one of those people whose humility becomes almost a personality defect.

Mix thoroughly, and heat to lukewarm. That's basically the recipe for vicar/author G.P. Taylor's debut novel \\"Shadowmancer,\\" a lame and limp semi-spiritual fantasy.<br /><br />Like many a fantasy villain, Obadiah Demurral wants to play God, and the corrupt vicar does so by trafficking with evil powers -- all-out sorcery and devil-worship. Enter Raphah, a mysterious man from Africa who is after a mystery amulet that will be incredibly destructive if evil people get their hands on it. (Wow, that's original)<br /><br />Are our heroes going to let Demurral and the forces of evil win? Of course not. Troubled teen Thomas Barrick (who has quasi-religious visions) and his pal Kate team up with Raphah to somehow keep Demurral from becoming king of the universe with the help of that amulet. But can our heroes win out against Pyratheon (read: the devil)?<br /><br />Original fantasy is hard to come by, and \\"Shadowmancer\\" doesn't improve the situation. It's your basic good vs. evil-forces-stirring-up-Armageddon story, with a heavy layer of religious allegory. Taylor manages to dredge up a few interesting mythical creatures, and a solid Yorkshire setting, but they're drowned out by the trite writing.<br /><br />No way is religious fantasy a bad thing in itself -- after all, C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien rooted their stories partly in religion. But Taylor's brand of Christianity is very watered-down, very generic, very politically-correct and VERY preachy. He lays this bland religious goo on so thickly that it's hard to read without feeling twitchy and uncomfortable. \\"Riathamus [God] stands at the door of your life and knocks. If you hear his call and answer him he will share your life and live with you always,\\" Raphah announces. It's like he's reading from a pamphlet.<br /><br />Nor can you expect much in the way of character development; everyone is a symbol rather than a person. Demurral is a cackling, mustache-twirling devil-worshiper. Saintly Raphah is as dull as the proverbial ditchwater, and so are the plucky kids who accompany him. There are no shades of grey here. A flawed person either is evil, or he's just waiting to be redeemed.<br /><br />\\"Shadowmancer\\" is packaged as a thrilling dark fantasy for kids.

Though both the crabby enchanter Dallben and the gentle ex-warrior Coll tell Taran that he shouldn't complain, he wants to be a hero. Taran inadvertantly ends up in an adventure when he chases Hen Wen into the woods - only to be chased by a masked, horned man on horseback.<br /><br />Taran is rescued by Gwydion, Prince of Don, who agrees to bring the overeager young man with him to another city to warn them about the Horned King, who is a servant of Arawn Deathlord. But the undead Cauldron-born capture Taran and Gwydion and bring them to Spiral Castle, the home of the enchantress Achren. Achren imprisons Taran; but he is set free by her \\"niece,\\" a flaky-seeming but very sharp girl named Eilonwy. With Gwydion presumed dead, Taran must set out to warn his allies about the growing threat of the Horned King. Going with him is Eilonwy, a pleasant bard-king who frequently stretches the truth, the twiggy and ever-loyal Gurgi, a crabby dwarf, and a very special sword...<br /><br />There are virtually no epic adventures for kids, let alone ones that adults can find absorbing as well. But the Prydain Chronicles definitely fit the category. Even though the action focuses primarily on Taran and his friends, the repercussions and events in them stretch all across Prydain, and Alexander never lets you forget it. And Gwydion's presence gives the feeling that rather than being the pivot of the conflict between good and evil, Taran is one of many cogs in a larger machine.<br /><br />Alexander is at his most versatile in the Prydain Chronicles, varying between a formal \\"ye olde\\" style and then switching to one of the comical arguments between Taran and Eilonwy. Eilonwy and Fflewddur Fflam add humor, with Fflewddur's frequent fibs causing his magical harp strings to break and Eilonwy puncturing Taran's ego when he gets a little too pompous. Yet Alexander includes sinister moments as well as well: The evil Horned King, and the silent, unkillable Cauldron-Born.<br /><br />Taran is an entirely human hero -- he longs for adventure but doesn't know what it's really like, takes himself too seriously, botches things, misjudges others, and has to learn from his mistakes. Eilonwy is a great counterpart, who keeps us from getting bored with Taran and by providing witty commentary on the proceedings. Gurgi initially seems sinister, but shows beginning signs of his steadfast loyalty.<br /><br />Though Lloyd Alexander informs readers that Prydain is NOT Wales, it definitely has the the Horned King, Gwydion, and the sword Dyrnwyn are carefully woven into the plot. But as J.R.R. Tolkien did, Alexander doesn't simply cut-and-paste them from a mythology book. Instead, he makes them essential parts of the story, and thus makes them his own.<br /><br />\\"The Book of Three\\" is not quite the same as its sequels -- it's not quite as grim, and it has a \\"younger\\" feel to the story.

Most fantasy heroes are not round, stodgy, middle-aged men who are respected pillars of the community.<br /><br />But Hope Mirrlees' enchanting fantasy \\"Lud-in-the-Mist\\" defies many such fantasy cliches, written as if \\"The Hobbit\\" had been spun up by Lord Dunsany. It's a sweet pastoral story that slowly blossoms out into a very unique story -- there's a little murder mystery, an amusing village of hobbity people, and a quicksilver dream of beautiful fairyland and otherworldly danger.<br /><br />Fairy is forbidden in the town of Lud -- not just fairy creatures and their exquisite fruit, but mentions of them, the dead who walk with them, and the Duke Aubrey who left with them.<br /><br />But all his life, the steadfastly dull Mayor Nathaniel Chanticleer has a lingering longing/fear for a strangely magical musical note. Despite all this, life remains boring and rather pleasant -- until Chanticleer's son Ranulph begins acting strangely, claiming that he's eaten fairy fruit.<br /><br />After Chanticleer sends his son off to a farm for a vacation, the teenage girls at Miss Primrose's Crabapple Academy suddenly seem to go pleasantly nuts, and then race off into the hills. Life seems to seep out of the old town,and Nathaniel must connect the present crises to a past conspiracy, all of which hinges on Fairyland, fairy fruit, and the sinister doctor Endymion Leer. The journey to discover the truth will take him out of the everyday world -- and change him forever.<br /><br />Haunting music, mad dancing, and ethereal meadows filled with fairy people and strange flowers. All through \\"Lud-in-the-Mist,\\" there's the underlying feeling that there's a frightening, exquisite world that is barely separated from ours. Rather than cliche elves with pointy ears, it relies on a dreamlike atmosphere and faraway lands that are only glimpsed in passing.<br /><br />Originally written in 1926, Hope Mirrlees' third book is an utterly unique experience -- it takes place in a pleasantly ordinary British town and charming pastoral towns, with fairy magic seeping into the cracks. And it's something of a love ode to \\"fairy\\" -- even though the inhabitants of Lud cherish their prosperous, staid existance, the the strange and exquisite blooms over the course of the book.<br /><br />And Mirrlees' writing is capable of bringing that to life -- she intertwines a fantasy, a murder mystery and a personal journey into one. The first part of the book is written in a pleasantly cozy, mellow style that focuses on the colourful, staid town of Lud. But as the story blossoms into a tangle of crises and mysteries, Mirrlees' writing becomes more lush, exquisite and haunting.<br /><br />Chanticleer is very reminiscent of Bilbo Baggins -- he's pleasant, boring, stodgy but has a brave, eccentric interior that helps him become a very unusual hero. And the other inhabitants of Lud are similarly engaging and just a little bit quirky -- fairy-struck teenagers, snippy old ladies, the haughty farmer's wife, the quietly malevolent Endymion Leer, and the happily mad people.<br /><br />\\"Lud-in-the-Mist\\" emerged before the mold was made for fantasy novels, and its exquisitely funny writing shows why it's an enduring classic.es place in a pleasantly ordinary British town and charming pastoral towns, with fairy magic seeping into the cracks.

Nesbittian kids on an adventure.<br /><br />While Susan Cooper's  \\"Over Sea Under Stone\\" is perhaps the weakest of the \\"Dark is Rising\\" books, it's a solid little fantasy story on its own. It's a sprightly, fast-moving little story without much complexity, but the depiction of the genuinely spooky villains and the ancient treasure-hunt are pretty gripping little subplots -- and of course, it sets the stage for the brilliant sequels.<br /><br />Simon, Jane and Barney Drew have arrived at their great-uncle Merriman's seaside house for a vacation -- and rapidly become quite bored. But when exploring the attic, they unearth a very, very old map that is somehow connected with the legendary King Arthur. As anyone else would do, the kids begin the search to find a golden grail.<br /><br />But they soon find that they are not the only ones who want the map. A seemingly genial pair of vacationers are being slightly too inquisitive, and someone breaks into Merriman's house in search of the map. And Merriman reveals the origins of the map -- and an ages-old conflict between good and evil that hinges on who finds the grail first.<br /><br />Taken alone, \\"Over Sea Under Stone\\" is a solid, even excellent fantasy story; as part of a series, a little out of sync with the other books. However it sets excellent groundwork, has an intriguing storyline and a good mix of folklore and Arthuriana, and offers us one of the most mysterious and likable \\"magic mentors,\\" Merriman Lyon. Say \\"Merry Lyon\\" really fast and see what you get.<br /><br />It starts off with every kid's fantasy -- treasure maps and ancient kings -- and rapidly blossoms into something that hints at an endless, epic clash between the Dark and the Light. But it never gets too heavy -- Cooper's writing is plain and workmanlike, heavy on the chirpy dialogue between the kids, but with the occasional spurt of bright, evocative prose or snatch of memorable poetry.<br /><br />The Drew kids are very much the standard kids you find in British children's stories -- plucky, peppy and determined to forge on ahead even if they have little idea what they're doing. They feel rather interchangeable at times, but are pleasant enough to read about. Merriman is a solid counterpoint, a pleasant humorous old man whose demeanor hints that still waters run deep; he's more aware than anyone else of what's going on. As for the villains, they are soaked in a sense of foreboding.<br /><br />While \\"Over Sea, Under Stone\\" lacks the powerful magical presence of its sequels, it is still a pretty entertaining, well-written little fantasy -- treasure, magic, and the legacy of a king.ch of memorable poetry.<br /><br />The Drew kids are very much the standard kids you find in British children's stories -- plucky, peppy and determined to forge on ahead even if they have little idea what they're doing.

Somehow the story never quite gels together, and Crossley-Holland's spare prose doesn't cover those flaws.<br /><br />Arthur de Caldicot has become a knight, and is now engaged to Winnie. Now he ends up in Venice in preparation for the retaking of Jerusalem, still keeping his \\"seeing stone\\" and thinking of his mentor Merlin. But things take a nasty turn when Arthur learns that the Saracens are not bloodthirsty barbarians, but intelligent and cultured.<br /><br />Disillusioned, Arthur is repulsed by the horrors around him -- including Christians fighting one another. And when Lord Stephen is wounded, Arthur is able to go back to England with him, which is where he belongs. With the aid of his seeing stone, Arthur is able to find the final answers of his life and his fragmented family.<br /><br />The fundamental flaw of \\"King of the Middle-March\\" is the same as the previous two books in this trilogy -- there really isn't a lot of linkage between the stories of Arthur Pendragon and Arthur de Caldicot. Okay, human beings can be mean, and glorious things can deteriorate due to human evils -- that's not much to go on. The tale of an innocent young man in the Crusades would have been interesting in itself, but Crossley-Holland never explores the depths of that story.<br /><br />And what's more, this story is... rather boring. The Arthurian interludes are too few to really drag you in; instead it's the minutiae of living with Crusaders. Arthur de Caldicot is not a terribly interesting character, and the details of currying horses and political chitchat just bog the book down even further. Detailed writing could have brought this story to life, but Crossley-Holland's bare-bones writing is frustratingly sparse. Even potentially glorious scenes like the finding of the Grail, complete with a cameo by Jesus Christ, are rendered almost like a poorly-written screenplay.<br /><br />Arthur is the only character of any real importance, and sadly he's not interesting enough to really grab your attention. Despite the time that has gone by since the first book of the trilogy, he sounds exactly the same -- naive, a little clueless, and virtually emotionless.

For the ones who haven't, Jude Fisher is like a best pal when it comes to filling in details. Her \\"Lord Of The Rings: The Complete Visual Companion\\" not only encompasses the three visual guides she wrote before, and rounds it off with the finales.<br /><br />Things have been reshuffled a little to allow for better flow (why bother with recap if it's all in the same book) and the three visual guides together seem almost seamless. Fisher examines in detail the many characters from mild hobbit Frodo down to loathsome Grima Wormtongue, the places (such as the exquisite Lothlorian) pivotal battles, strange monsters and climactic events like the battle of the Pelennor Fields.<br /><br />\\"The Return of the King Visual Companion,\\" the last of the three books, was released over a month before the movie was -- therefore, Fisher was restrained from giving away anything that happens after Frodo and Sam reach Mount Doom. In short, it didn't tell us anything about how the movie ended -- would Frodo destroy the Ring, or would it possess him? Would Aragorn become king? Would he marry Arwen?<br /><br />Now that \\"Return of the King\\" is almost a year behind us, Fisher is free to include new chapters and beautiful photographs from the last parts of the trilogy. She adds on the climax of the entire trilogy, with Frodo struggling into the heart of Mount Doom, and ends the chapter with the ambiguous line \\"I have made my choice.\\" No, it's not clear what he chose just by reading.<br /><br />After that comes a chapter detailing the coronation and wedding of Aragorn and Arwen, a chapter about the Fellowship splitting up for the last time, the Hobbits returning home, and a mention of Sam Gamgee's wedding to his beloved Rosie Cotton. In the final chapter (including the loveliest picture in the entire book), Fisher describes Frodo's final departure from Middle-Earth into the west.<br /><br />Fisher has a pleasant, breezy style, and is able to explain the world of Middle-Earth without dumbing down the material. Sometimes she adds background info (such as Frodo's tragic life before coming to live with Bilbo) that was not a part of the actual script, but is essential to the characters anyway. The varied, colorful photographs are quite gorgeous, and the book has been reissued in a trade paperback with glossy flaps.<br /><br />Anyone disappointed that \\"The Return of the King Visual Companion\\" did not include the climax and ending will be pleased by \\"The Lord Of The Rings: The Complete Visual Companion\\" -- like the trilogy, the visual guides are best read in one big chunk./>Fisher has a pleasant, breezy style, and is able to explain the world of Middle-Earth without dumbing down the material.

But he's suddenly called and told that Grim Tuesday has somehow called in debts of Mister Monday's -- including Arthur's entire world, among others. Houses are being mysteriously sold, creatures are swarming through his city, and the stock market is going wonky. So Arthur has to get back to the House and somehow get everything right again.<br /><br />He narrowly escapes being attacked by one of Tuesday's minions, and ends up being dumped in the Far Reaches. There, he becomes an indentured servant to Tuesday, in an enormous Pit that mines Nothing, and is undermining the very foundations of the House. With the help of his friend Suzy Blue and a nautical captain (and Tuesday's discarded soot-eating eyebrow), he must somehow get the second key and second part of the Will -- or be destroyed by Tuesday.<br /><br />Nix widens the scope of the world he introduced in \\"Mister Monday.\\" Now that we're acquainted with concepts like the House, the Will, and the different Days, he goes full-speed into the storyline. There are plenty of interesting hints about the future -- especially a communique from Lady Wednesday. What will Nix do next? Only time will tell.<br /><br />This book is a little off-kilter -- the bureaucratic terms can make your head spin sometimes. What's more, Nix spends too much time focusing on zipping up with the Ascending Wings and clinging to the top. However, his descriptions of the mine are excellent, full of despair and misery. You can almost smell the soot and grime. Not to mention the hideous Nithlings, as creepy and sinister as anything out of Nix's classic dark fantasy \\"Sabriel.\\"<br /><br />Grim Tuesday is an interesting villain in himself -- the ultimate plagiarizer, a guy who can't actually make things himself.

Unfortunately, \\"Snakecharm\\" falls just as flat on its face as her previous books, although in entirely different ways. It has promise for the future, but the most interesting person in the entire book is Zane's infant nephew.<br /><br />Serpiente Zane Cobriana and his avian mate Danica Shardae have been happily married for awhile, even if the union is making both snakes and birds uneasy. Things get even more tense when Danica faints during a ritual dance, and is found to be pregnant with a half snake, half hawk baby. Zane is initially pleased, but there's the nagging question of which kingdom the baby will rule -- especially when someone tries to kill Danica, and healing them means she will only have one.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a vicious, powerful falcon named Syfka has come to the serpiente city to find a renegade falcon, and she sows doubts in Zane's mind about whether the serpiente/avian alliance will last. Zane suspects that the renegade is someone in the Royal Flight that guards Danica, but the shapeshifting magic of the falcons means that it could be anyone. He has a choice -- find and turn in the renegade, or face destruction from the falcons.<br /><br />\\"Snakecharm\\" has a typical problem: the first three-fourths read as if Atwater-Rhodes was dragging her feet, trying to figure out how to deal with the problems she had brought up. Then slam-bang, she tacks in quickie answers to all of them. Unfortunately, as in her previous books, her plot twists are never explored, and the conflicts are usually fixed in a few pages.<br /><br />There are some interesting concepts, such as the falcon supremacy or the concept of the blended-race \\"Wyvern's Court.\\" Sadly, the falcons just become sneering, two-dimensional nasties and the Court is rapidly accepted by everybody, including Danica's narrow-minded mother.

Dragons, magic, wizards, and dozens of different islands are all entwined in an intriguing contrast between the young and the old, death and life.<br /><br />Arren, prince of Anlad, comes to Roke to tell the wizards there dire news: Magic is seeping out of his country, where words no longer have power and spells are forgotten. The aged Archmage, Ged Sparrowhawk, sets off with the eager, sheltered young prince to find out what is draining the \\"wells of wizardry.\\"<br /><br />As they cross Earthsea, they find more difficulties, places where magic is draining away, the dragons are dueling, spells and songs are forgotten, and the dead are crossing over under the influence of a mysterious figure who is at the source of it all. Great changes are in store for both Arren and Ged before they can deal with the strange forces changing Earthsea...<br /><br />It's undeniable that the original trilogy of Earthsea novels were superior to Le Guin's later Earthsea works, both in literary and storytelling terms. Le Guin's writing had clearly matured somewhat from the more formal manner of \\"Wizard of Earthsea,\\" as here we have better insight into Arren's thoughts and feelings. The dialogue is also less formal, as we have more jokes, teasing, and an amusing scene where Arren and his \\"nuncle\\" Ged are playing around with accents and dialects.<br /><br />It is still fairly formal; however, the villain of this piece evokes greater horror than did Ged's shadow in the first book. At the same time, deep poignancy is present in such scenes as the dead looking out at the living, and the old woman hysterically crying out her true name, because \\"there are no secrets, and there is no truth, and there is no death.\\"<br /><br />The relationship between the young, naive Arren and the more experienced, older Sparrowhawk is the underlying thread in this novel. Though Ged, to Arren, lessons and philosophies are revealed to the reader and spelled out in a way that will leave them thinking carefully. And Le Guin provides an intriguing contrast between age and youth: Ged's experience and wisdom are necessary as Arren knows virtually nothing about what could cause the crisis, while Arren's innocence and loyalty are necessary as a counterbalance.<br /><br />Ged shows a weariness in this book not present before; his reflections on death and life seem to be connected to his greater age. Arren is an essentially good young man, very realistic in that he is not a spoiled brat, but has never been given the opportunity to do anything difficult and good before in his life. The supporting characters are rarely around long, and none develop the depth of those main two; though many references are made to the previous two books, especially the second, it is not necessary to have read them to understand this.<br /><br />An entrancing fantasy epic and a thought-provoking look at life and death, this book may be the most fulfilling and well-made of Le Guin's many Earthsea books.wk is the underlying thread in this novel.

Other poems included are the eerie \\"Tattoo\\" (\\"The webs of your eyes/Are fastened/To the flesh and bones of you/As to rafters or grass\\"), the thirteen-part poem \\"Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird,\\" the haunting \\"Domination of Black\\" (\\"I saw how the night came,/Came striding like the color of the heavy hemlocks\\"), and the languid, semi-spiritual \\"Sunday Morning.\\"<br /><br />The Dover Thrift collection does a good job of showing the various kinds of poetry that Stevens wrote -- some are infused with color, some with darkness, some with a rich overtone, some very brief like the tiny \\"Valley Candle.\\" Many of Stevens' best poems are included in here.<br /><br />One thing that Stevens' writing always has is beauty -- even in the weird ones. With only a few words he can evoke images that are exquisite, soothing, even eerie (\\"My candle burned alone in an immense valley\\"). He also infuses his poetry with intense colors and plenty of nature references, birds and trees, snow and rain and wind.<br /><br />\\"The Emperor of Ice Cream\\" -- despite the somewhat silly title -- is an excellent showcase for some of Stevens' best works. Definitely worth checking out for fans of richly-conceived verse.	2004-11-13

If anything, it seems steadier and more controlled than \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" as several characters become more central and the plot focus widens to envelop all of Middle Earth. It suffers from a bit of sequelitis in places, but the overall book is just as enthralling as the first.<br /><br /> Aragorn finds that Merry and Pippin have been abducted rather than killed -- for what reason, no one knows. Frodo and Sam have left on their own. So Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli race to find the orcs and retrieve the hobbits, but are stopped by the fierce Riders of Rohan, and then by an old and dear friend: Gandalf, who has been resurrected in the new form of a White wizard. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin must use all of their wits to escape the orcs, and then find a strange band of allies that no one could have hoped for.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam head into Mordor -- with an eerily familiar figure, Gollum, following them. Frodo subjugates Gollum, forcing him to swear on \\"the precious\\" that he won't harm him. In return, Gollum promises to guide the two hobbits through Mordor, straight to Mount Doom. But the Ring is weighing more heavily than ever on Frodo, and is starting to reassert its old sway on Gollum...<br /><br />One of the most noticeable changes in this book is the shift of focus. \\"Fellowship\\" was Frodo-centric, since the narration revolved around him, as did all the events and thoughts. But with the breaking of the Fellowship, the narration falls into three categories: Frodo and Sam; Merry and Pippin; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. This triple style allows individuals to shine more brightly, when they are called on to do more than hike with Frodo.<br /><br />Tolkien also presented a wider view of Middle-Earth in general. While the slow slog through Mordor doesn't really tell or show readers much -- aside from what a hellhole Sauron is the middle of -- it's shocking to see the the effects of the orcs, Saruman and Sauron on places such as Gondor and Rohan.<br /><br />Changes can be seen in Frodo even in this book, and which become more pronounced in the third book of the trilogy, \\"Return of the King.\\" He becomes sadder and more introspective, and the Ring's growing hold on him can be glimpsed at times. Aragorn is also changing. He is no longer merely the rugged outcast Ranger, but displays the hints of a future great king, if he can only get to his throne.<br /><br />Merry and Pippin also change: these two innocent young hobbits have to suddenly Sam is more promiment in this book, as Frodo's friend and personal pillar of strength.<br /><br />But where Tolkien really outdid himself is Gollum. Gollum returns, in a substantially different state. Oh, he's still addled and addicted to the Ring, but he displays a dual love/loathing for the Ring, a weird affection for Frodo (who, from his point of view, is probably the only person who has been kind to him), and displays a Ring-induced multiple-personality syndrome. Very rarely can bad guys elicit the sort of loathing and pity from the reader that Gollum does.<br /><br />One noticeable aspect of this book is friendship. When the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, virtually everyone is a stranger, with the exception of the hobbits. However, in this book we get our view of how much Sam loves Frodo and wants to help him. Sam is fully aware of how much Frodo needs emotional support, and he's quite willing to be a pillar of strength for his friend. We see Gimli and Legolas's affection for Merry and Pippin; and Legolas's willingness to kill Eomer if Eomer hurts Gimli shows how far this Elf and Dwarf have come.<br /><br />This book is substantially darker than \\"Fellowship.\\" Frodo is starting to stumble under the weight of the Ring, and other characters die or are seriously hurt. The scene where Pippin's mind is trapped by Sauron is a very disturbing one, as is a violent and saddening scene late in the book. But there is alsosome wry humor: Gandalf's joke as he hears Saruman throttling Grima Wormtongue, Legolas's snippy comments about pipeweed as Gimli and the hobbits smoke up a storm, and Sam's debate with Gollum about whether they should cook the rabbits.<br /><br />Tolkien's second \\"Lord of the Rings\\" novel is a thrilling fantasy adventure, exploring more of his invented world than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did. \\"The Two Towers\\" starts heading into darker territory, and will leave readers panting for more.some wry humor: Gandalf's joke as he hears Saruman throttling Grima Wormtongue, Legolas's snippy comments about pipeweed as Gimli and the hobbits smoke up a storm, and Sam's debate with Gollum about whether they should cook the rabbits.<br /><br />Tolkien's second \\"Lord of the Rings\\" novel is a thrilling fantasy adventure, exploring more of his invented world than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did. \\"The Two Towers\\" starts heading into darker territory, and will leave readers panting for more.	2004-11-12

Oh, whatever.<br /><br />Long ago, the struggle between two of the seven gods \\"sundered\\" the earth. The eldest of the Shapers, Haomane, fought against his youngest brother Sartoris, and now there is a prophecy about the events that will lead to Sartoris's destruction and ultimate defeat. Haomane wants his brother dead, but only soils his reputation by painting him as evil incarnate. Sartoris, wounded by a magical dagger, doesn't seem to care much.<br /><br />Now a red star signals that the prophecy is underway. Sartoris is determined to stop the prophecy (dunce, they always come true anyway!), and sends his grief-stricken, immortal sidekick Tanaros to kidnap an Ellylon (elf) girl to prevent her from wedding mortal heir to the throne, Aarocus Altorus, the descendent of Tanaros's unfaithful wife and her lover.<br /><br />Yes, the sparkle is gone. Say hello to another Tolkien clone, complete with similar names, wise elves separated by seas, a noble king of men engaged to a lovely elf princess, powerful ad wise wizards, dragons, and a little powerful object carried around the neck of one character. It feels as if Carey was sleepwriting this novel, renaming fantasy cliches and tacking them into a story that, as an outline, had promise.<br /><br />And it did have promise -- the shades of grey, the ends justifying the means, and the concept of honor. But it's bogged down by the overabundance of characters. Whittle them down already -- there are too many for any of them to get much character development. Carey has a strong, vivid writing style, although she needs some help with names. Darkhaven? Sounds like a D&D name. \\"Banewreaker\\"? Oh, ditto. And she has an unfortunate tendency to lapse into \\"ye olde fantasyspeak,\\" one of those annoying dialogue problems that afflict high fantasy writers. Enough with the \\"aughts\\"!<br /><br />In theory, most of the characters are interesting -- especially Sartoris, who is perhaps the most three-dimensional person in the book. He's considered an evil god, yet he isn't evil. Same with Tanaris, who murdered his wife long ago, but the fact is that Tanaris is also rather dull in his unending angst. It happened long ago, they weren't worth moping about, get over it. And supporting characters like the beautiful elf girl and noble king are never explored as much as they should be.<br /><br />It's interesting to have a fantasy book that looks at the POV of the bad guys, but Jacqueline Carey fumbles badly by putting it all in a Tolkien-clone universe, and by creating more characters than she can deal with.

That is, until the day Adam Fin comes there, with his beautiful pieces of otherworldly jewelry and a mysterious past. Megan finds herself fascinated by Adam, while Jonah finds him strange. Megan is haunted by the sea, by strange and sometimes alarming characters lurking around, and by the image of the sea hare.<br /><br />But Jonah succumbs to a different kind of siren song, when a beautiful singer at a local bar lures him in with her voice. Soon he has left Megan, the world that he knows, and most of his brain cells to follow the beautiful woman down into the waves. Megan agrees to venture down herself, along with the enigmatic Adam, to find her beloved and try to bring him back. In the process, she and Jonah both must discover the dangerous, angry, grieving beauty of the sea and what they must do for it.<br /><br />The novella is shorter than most of McKillip's books and longer than her short stories, yet full-fleshed and believable, the simplicity of the story masked by the ornate language she employs so well. Repeated use of seaweed, pearls, bright fish, shells, mer-creatures, and exotic sea-creatures in unusual roles add a note of dreaminess to the proceedings--not that they need it. Except for a few key Jonah-Megan scenes, the entire book has the feel of a beautiful, prolonged dream.<br /><br />Also unlike most of McKillip's books, this is a contemporary novel, as evidenced by the first page where Megan finds an Orange Crush can and a styrofoam float. Yet this never interferes with the flow of the book, which deals with imagery as timeless as the sea itself. Don't expect the Big Message to beat you over the head with its theme -- McKillip weaves it in softly and subtlely, though it is hinted in where Megan walks along the beach and sees the junk strewn around. The message about pollution becomes clearest at the end, but during subsequent rereadings one can see the clues lined up, but never overemphasized.<br /><br />The characters are well-drawn: Megan, the rather misty young woman who only really seems to wake up when she heads down into the dreamy world of the sea. Jonah is aptly named, a rather bedazzled young man gets sucked (ironically, by his own will rather than against it) down into the depths. \\"Welcome to the belly of the whale\\" indeed. Adam himself is everything he's supposed to be--sexy, ambiguous, in form as well as in mind, for we see him shift from everything from a man to a splash of shapeshifting sea-foam. His sister is not as defined--we know she is dangerous, beautiful, seductive, etc--but perhaps that is deliberate, as we see little of her but constant hints as Jonah pursues her.<br /><br />One of McKillip's less known novels is also among her best. \\"Something Rich and Strange\\" proves to be a magical, beautiful journey into an enchanted sea realm.

Clare Naylor and Mimi Hare attack well-worn turf in the chic-lit \\"The Second Assistant,\\" which starts on wobbly ground, but gains its footing about two-thirds of the way in.<br /><br />Elizabeth Miller is a second assistant -- meaning she's the assistant of the assistant -- at a large talent agency in Hollywood. Surrounding her are narcissistic stars, hamhanded producers, and Machievellian fellow assistants. After some run-ins with moderately attractive men in \\"the industry\\" who turn out to be sluts or pervs, she becomes a lot more cynical.<br /><br />Doing her work while struggling with vegetables, her drug-addled boss, and her insane shrink isn't easy. At the same time, Lizzie is trying to help an aspiring screenwriter pal get his screenplay onto the silver screen. At the Sundance Festival, both romance and screenplay success seem to be within her grasp, until twin disasters hit...<br /><br />The first third of \\"The Second Assistant\\" smacks of \\"Devil Wore Prada\\" -- gripes about the insane lives of downtrodden assistants. Not to mention the classification of L.A.'s entire population as surgically enhanced, air-headed pond scum. Fortunately the plot actually takes over after awhile, glossing over the flaws. It lacks the bite and fire of Robin Lynn Williams's \\"The Assistants,\\" but it's a fun light read.<br /><br />Hare and Naylor do have a pretty good writing style, even if they do name-drop half the celebrities under the sun. They throw in plenty of Machiavellian plot twists and schemes, while wrapping L.A. in a glow of make-believe -- especially during the difficult Halloween party, the film festival, and Elizabeth rushing to rescue her naked, robbed boss from a cheapo motel. And they have a pretty good sense of humor, such as the scene where Lizzie goes to a shrink, only to have the shrink professionally consult the voices in her head.<br /><br />Lizzie is a pretty nice character, starting out ridiculously naive but rapidly growing a thick skin to protect herself from all the backstabbing. Supporting characters like gloomy, cynical Lara and snort-anything-that-was-once-a-pill Scott are good supports for her, as well as bohemian-geek screenwriter Jason and slutty star Jake. Only love interest Luke (must there ALWAYS be a sensitive soulmate in these books?) is too flat -- he seems tailored to deflate Lizzie's cynicism.<br /><br />\\"The Second Assistant\\" is not the bottom of the literary ladder, and not the top.

And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.<br /><br />We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \\"Mad Baggins\\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.<br /><br />Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.<br /><br />Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the \\"feel\\" of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.<br /><br />Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.<br /><br />One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.<br /><br />Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say \\"everyhobbit.\\"<br /><br />We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit to someone bolder and more decisive. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.<br /><br />Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again.den sides and powers here.

Tolkien's epic saga, the fantasy that created the genre as we know it today. Now, as the blockbuster movie adaptation is over, many readers are checking out the dramatic story that ends Tolkien's masterpiece and life's work.<br /><br />The story opens where \\"Two Towers\\" left off. Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives. And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.<br /><br />In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?<br /><br />Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline, one by one. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel; Tolkien shows that in a struggle against evil, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.<br /><br />This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Aside from Frodo's emotional deterioration, we also have Merry becoming almost catatonic after the battle with the Witch King, and Denethor's descent into suicidal madness. There is a lot less humor, though it is still there: Pippin and Merry both thinking about food, Gandalf's reaction when Pippin pledges his sword to Denethor, some choice witty comments of Frodo's in the last chapters, and Gimli's half-joking threats to axe Eomer if Eomer doesn't consider Galadriel the most beautiful woman in the world.<br /><br />Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, and of course the bittersweet final scene.<br /><br />Frodo is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down by the pressure of the Ring, to the point where he seems to be only a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Yet these actions make chilling sense, even when Frodo recovers his self-control only a moment later. It's a devastating demonstration of the hold the Ring has on him; he tries to resist it while knowing that he's falling too far into its grasp. When he lapses into depression and nihilism, readers will wonder if he can actually give it up.<br /><br />Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves. This book has him chasing orcs with Sting, carrying Frodo physically through Mordor, fending off Gollum, and acting as the ultimate pillar of strength for his crumbling friend right to Mount Doom. Merry is exposed firsthand to the horrifying consequences of war, andPippin moves past his initial flakiness in an effort to be a serious warrior. Aragorn breaks completely from the mold of rugged ranger and into the new status as a king, leading armies (both living and dead) without flinching.<br /><br />As far as the supporting cast goes, Legolas and Gimli assist as well; their friendship grows deeper, even as Legolas falls completely in love with the sea. Gollum's degenerate journey remains intertwined with Frodo's, even though he betrayed the hobbits in the previous book; and the icily passionate war-maiden Eowyn affects the War of the Ring in a stunning way that nobody could have predicted.<br /><br />The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. Another good addition is \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of LOTR can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following LOTR.<br /><br />It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants. But as Gandalf says, \\"I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\\"Pippin moves past his initial flakiness in an effort to be a serious warrior.

Rather than the otherworldly naturescapes and human fears, he seems to focus on how people communicate this time around. Unfortunately, he sacrifices some of the poetry's power in the process.<br /><br />\\"Something there is that doesn't love a wall,\\" is the first line of one of Frost's more typical poems here, a nuanced work about neighbors rebuilding a wall between them. But then there are poems like \\"Death of the Hired Man,\\" a long conversation between a man and his wife, about a former worker who has returned home to die. Another is just about a mountain, as told by a farmhand.<br /><br />Robert Frost even in his more lackluster writings is still a great poet. Unfortunately \\"North of Boston\\" is a bit less engaging than his first collection.  It's laced with Frost's exquisite phrasing (\\"A bead of silver water more or less/Strung on your hair won't hurt your summer looks\\"), but is more mundane and grounded.<br /><br />In the emotional sense, the conversation poetry is quite striking. In a quiet way. Frost seems to have been studying people's interactions, such as the gradual softening of a woman when she finds that someone she had formerly considered worthless is only there to die in a place he loves. On an emotional note, it's beautiful.<br /><br />In the technical sense, some readers might not be thrilled about the conversational poems, which are mostly composed of two people talking in a rather grounded fashion. (\\"Stark?\\" he inquired. \\"No matter for the proof.\\"/\\"Yes, Stark. And you?\\"/\\"I'm Stark.\\" He drew his passport.) But it is quite intriguing to see Frost expanding his poetry and seeing what else he was capable of doing.<br /><br />\\"North of Boston\\" is not Robert Frost's best collection, but it is an interesting and very well-written one. Just don't expect anything like \\"A Boy's Will,\\" his first poetry collection.	2004-11-10

Diana Wynne-Jones has become one of the best known fantasy writers still around today. Wizards, witches, monsters and a good dose of comic relief characterize her books, including the solid duology \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" and \\"Castle in the Air.\\"<br /><br />In \\"Howl's Moving Castle,\\" timid Sophie was the eldest of three daughters, meaning that she had nil chance of destiny finding a great place for her. She vents her frustrations on an old woman who comes into her hat shop... only to find out that the old woman is the Witch of the Wastes, who ages her into a crone. Deeply annoying, Sophie tramps off to the castle of the magician Howl, who reportedly drains the souls of young maidens... and who turns out to be a lot more of a handful than Sophie predicted.<br /><br />In \\"Castle in the Air,\\" the not-so-prosperous Abdullah is a carpet merchant, but spends more time lost in his own thoughts. Things take an unexpected twist when a man sells him a magical carpet. It whisks him off to the garden of a lovely princess, who is fated to marry whatever man she sees first. That's fine with Abdullah. They try to elope, only to have the princess kidnapped by a hideous djinn. Now he's on the run with a mercenary, a malicious genie, and and a pair of cats.<br /><br />You can tell a book is good if Hayao Miyazaki has made an animated movie about it (although if he does the sequel, he'll need to change the title). And while undoubtedly Miyazaki has brought his own brand of creative magic to the film, Jones's variety is intact and present in these two books.<br /><br />Don't think that the wrong two books have been meshed together when \\"Castle in the Air\\" starts -- Howl and Co. are in the book, they just take awhile to show up. Jones takes the opportunity to poke a little fun at Arabian-Nights settings, as well as fairy-tale conventions (why do older sisters get all the tough luck, huh?).<br /><br />Her writing is brisk and highly entertaining, especially when the unfortunate Sophie struggles to deal with the rather immature, erratic Howl, or when Abdullah has to carefully phrase his wishes to the malicious genie -- or risk getting his wishes twisted. And her characters are, in the end, likable people -- they have individual quirks and personalities that make them fun to read about. And colorful ones -- enslaved fire demons, embittered genies, dreamy carpet merchants, and a damsel turned into an old lady.<br /><br />Before Hayao Miyazaki's film comes to the United States, brush up on Diana Wynn-Jones' original fantasy duology. Fun, weird and a little bit twisted.Sophie struggles to deal with the rather immature, erratic Howl, or when Abdullah has to carefully phrase his wishes to the malicious genie -- or risk getting his wishes twisted.

Don't stop working in the fashion industry, Rebecca -- because you're really not much of a writer.<br /><br />Kate Castle is a snotty fashion designer, working for the legendary Penny Moss -- she designs clothes, hobnobs with the rich'n'famous, hangs out with gay publicists, and so forth. She basically slept her way to her current position -- not with Penny, but with Penny's son, Kate's sweet-natured fiancee Ludo. Basically, it's the life most women would kill for, but the self-absorbed Kate wants a few last bed romps before settling down.<br /><br />Her seemingly perfect life changes when Kate has a side fling with hunka-hunka-burnin'-lust Liam Callaghan, and news leaks out. With the dissolvement of her engagement to Ludo, she also loses the job Penny gave her, and is tossed unceremoniously from Ludo's apartment. Suddenly she finds herself with the looming prospect of having to do actual work for her living, and finds that her personality is alienating everyone around her.<br /><br />Chick lit has become something to satirize in recent years, with books like \\"Cassandra French's Finishing School for Boys.\\" But satire is hard to write. And Rebecca Campbell, who works in the fashion industry herself, had better not give up her day job -- this irritating, blandly-written book is the proof of why.<br /><br />The killing point of this book is that Campbell -- after making you despise Kate -- suddenly decides that her heroine is worth caring about anyway, and should be given a happy ending, despite being obnoxiously self-centerd and lacking in any redeeming characteristics. So she starts rigging up a ridiculous path back to Kate's former job, including a defunct fashion mogul (oh how very coincidental), inept coworkers, and finally blackmail over a porn video. Everything falls into place with no effort, which give the book the feel of an amateur who lost control of her plot, then quickly reshuffled it into a quickie ending.<br /><br />Kate frankly is not interesting or intelligent enough to be the \\"anti Bridget Jones\\" -- while nasty people can be compelling protagonists, she's too much of a self-centered idiot to ever be compelling. She just comes across as a shallow, whiny child-woman who will shag any semi-attractive male, if she can avoid being caught. Most of the supporting characters come across as paper dolls, especially Penny. Honestly, isn't the bash-my-evil-boss-by-proxy thing getting a little old?<br /><br />One of Kate Castle's friends says that no one would care if she died in the streets. Well, it's hard to imagine caring if this book died in the remainder bins. Shallow, obnoxious, and poorly written.the book the feel of an amateur who lost control of her plot, then quickly reshuffled it into a quickie ending.

Ever since the publication of J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit,\\" people have imagined wizards as tall, elderly men with long gray beards, loose robes and pointed hats. Diana Wynne-Jones shatters the cliched image with Chrestomanci, a dapper Englishman who happens to be the nine-lived magician in charge of all the magic -- in all the parallel worlds.<br /><br />\\"Charmed Life\\" is the story of Cat and Gwendolen, siblings who are orphaned in a tragic steamboat accident. While Cat is shy, Gwendolen is the opposite: She is an unnaturally powerful witch, and intends to rise high enough to rule the world. She thinks that she's got it made when the powerful mage Chrestomanci brings her and her brother to his castle. But Gwendolen has met her match in Chrestomanci -- and a magical war of wills has begun!<br /><br />\\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" is the backstory of Chrestomanci. Once he was an ordinary boy, whose ambition was to become a cricket player. But when he is tested by a powerful magician, Christopher Chant is found to be Chrestomanci: An amazingly powerful magician with not one, but NINE lives. The problem is, Christopher doesn't want to be Chrestomanci -- and he's already enmeshed in a wizards' smuggling ring that may spell doom for his new friends...<br /><br />\\"Witch Week\\" takes place in England, at a school called Larwood House that is reminiscent of English boarding schools in such books as Harry Potter -- but suspicion seethes in this one. In this world, witches are burned at the stake. And someone is a witch -- but who is it? Unpopular, chubby Nan, who is descended from a legendary witch? Silent Indian boy Nirupam? The identity of the witch (or witches) may change the world...<br /><br />\\"The Magicians of Caprona\\" takes place in Italy, in the city of Caprona. Casa Montana and Casa Petrocchi are two Italian families of spellmakers, who have been feuding for a long time over an insult that neither family can really remember. Their feud is almost all they think about. But unknown to them, war and an evil enchanter are endangering Caprona. It falls to magically inept Tonini Montana and Angelina Petrocchi to save the day...<br /><br />Diana Wynne-Jones is at her best here: the books are funny, dramatic, well-characterized, well-written and well-plotted. The parallel worlds are well-thought out, such as Chrestomanci's world, where magic exists rather than science as we know it.<br /><br />As in many of her books, she shows unusual insights into the thought processes of both young and adolescent children. While readers may sometimes want to smack the lead characters, it's hard not to like the heroes and despise the villains. Young Chrestomanci himself is something of a preteen anti-hero, but is backed (both in childhood and adulthood) by intriguing characters like a bored young deity, lovestruck teachers, duplicitous teens and the occasional girl out to rule the world.<br /><br />Long before there was Harry Potter, Diana Wynne-Jones was penning the funny, imaginative tales about Chrestomanci. \\"Magicians of Caprona\\" and \\"Witch Week\\" pretty much break the mold for fantasy wizards, choosing to be humorous and inventive instead of melodramatic and cheesy.<br /><br />Don't expect fluffy fantasy. Jones's prose is amusing, dramatic, evocative and fast-paced. The intricate magical systems, where a single event can send an entire universe awry, are wonderfully portrayed and dramatically brought to our attention. And despite the Italian setting of \\"Caprona,\\" the books have a crisply British flavor. At the same time, \\"Witch Week\\" captures, without a sense of cozy romance, the trials of being at a school where you're the unpopular kid -- there's a clique of popular students, and a larger number of unhappy, lonely ones.<br /><br />The Chrestomanci books are an inviting, funny and sometimes chilling read for anyone who thought Harry Potter was the ultimate in juvenile wizard fiction.

So it's not a surprise that \\"Realms of Tolkien: Images of Middle-Earth\\" also has the good, the bad, and the really ugly.<br /><br />First, let it be known that several pictures by Alan Lee and John Howe are in here. Howe's breathtakingly vivid paintings rather like still photos, including the lovely picture that inspired Peter Jackson's Bag End. Moviegoers will also see other scenes from the films reflected in his pictures. Alan Lee, on the other hand, produces art that is more delicate and muted, relying on detail rather than a sense of action.<br /><br />Several other artists back them up, and some are quite good -- Ted Nasmith creates colorful, vivid images; his exquisite \\"Grey Havens\\" picture is particularly lovely. Inger Enderfeldt's are delicate and classic-looking. Some do well on only some pictures, such as Tony Ide: his rendering of Theoden in battle is pretty good, but his Treebeard picture is bizarre. Same with Fletcher, who does a good job with Gandalf on Gwaihir the eagle, yet makes the fearsome Lord of the Nazgul look like a squat astronaut on a stone horse.<br /><br />And then there's the really bad stuff. Alessandra Cimatoribus tries to render Treebeard as a sort of stained-glass window, and the result is just weird and squashed. Ita Muscad makes the hobbits look like tots, and Treebeard (see a trend here?) like a giant wrinkly turnip. And Cor Blok is the worst, making childish little sketches with dresses, moon-like faces and stick feet. Worst of all, he makes Gollum look like a duck.<br /><br />\\"Realms of Tolkien\\" doesn't entirely restrain itself to \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- there's also material from \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Silmarillion\\" here as well. (Although strangely enough, the oliphaunt picture on the cover isn't inside). And along with each picture comes the text from the books that it illustrates, since some pictures (like Lode Claes's \\"Nazgul\\") are ambiguous just by themselves.<br /><br />Starting the book is a one-page biography of J.R.R. Tolkien himself, along with the much-beloved picture of him laughing with pipe in mouth. Fans already acquainted with his life might as well skip it, since it tells nothing new. And at the end of the book are brief biographies of each artist. John Howe, Alan Lee, Timothy Ide, Tony Galuidi, Fletcher, Carol Emery Phenix and Inger Edelfeldt all provide their own anecdotes about why they created Tolkien art.<br /><br />\\"Realms of Tolkien\\" is about two-thirds good or middling, and one third outright bad. And if it introduces individual visions of Tolkien's work, then it's definitely worth checking out.t from the books that it illustrates, since some pictures (like Lode Claes's \\"Nazgul\\") are ambiguous just by themselves. <br /> <br />Starting the book is a one-page biography of J.R.R.

Unfortunately the same cannot be said of the novelizations. One is lackluster, two are okay, with occasional moments of brilliance.<br /><br />\\"A New Hope\\" is technically not so great, but the energy and exuberance of Lucas's first huge film just seeps out of the edges. It makes up for its writing shortcomings by not trying too hard, since this was before the immense success of the movie trilogy. Not very detailed, but not too spare either.<br /><br />Ironically, the best film of the trilogy, \\"Empire Strikes Back,\\" is rather dull as a novelization, coming across as fragmented and forced; Donald F. Glut seems to have been feeling the pressure. The flavor returns somewhat in \\"Return of the Jedi\\"'s novelization, which has more energy and spark than its predecessor. It feels like James Kahn was able to move past the overwhelming expectations and turn out something pretty good.<br /><br />Not much has been changed in the years since these novelizations were first published. The first one, ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster, was originally published as \\"Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker,\\" which accounts for the slightly space-serial-esque flavor of the first book. The second and third are less laid-back, and more intense.<br /><br />Since the novelizations were crafted from scripts, it often reads like the writers just inserted some detail here and there, along with \\"he said\\" or \\"she shouted.\\" But there are some scenes and lines that aren't in the final films. These make for some very interesting reading, especially when they add dimension to already existing characters. One example is Luke and Ben having a peculiar conversation about ducks; another is Luke and Briggs chatting on Tattooine.<br /><br />The \\"Star Wars\\" novelization trilogy is something of a mixed bag, but it's worth checking out for fans of Lucas's classic movies. It isn't too different from the scripts, but revisiting it in print is a pleasant diversion.as's classic movies.

It features a different coming-of-age tale from Ged Sparrowhawk's, this time of a spirited girl who has been given everything except freedom. More contemplative and disturbing, this is almost as good as \\"Wizard of Earthsea.\\"<br /><br />As a little child, Tenar was taken from her family by the priestesses, who said she was the reborn High Princess of the Nameless Ones, the dark, ruthless powers who are in the Tombs of Atuan. Her name is taken away and she was afterwards called Arha (which means that she was \\"eaten,\\" spiritually), and she is raised in the cold, uninviting temple. When Arha is fifteen, she finds that a wizard has somehow gained entrance to the massive mazelike Labyrinth, committing sacrilege and polluting the \\"center of darkness\\" with his staff's light.<br /><br />He's searching for half of a powerful ring; he has one half, she has the other. She takes the wizard Sparrowhawk prisoner, and for some reason doesn't want to kill him. Instead she listens to his stories about dragons, magic and his home -- until a vengeful priestess learns that Arha is keeping the wizard alive. To escape horrible deaths, they must escape together from the Nameless Ones, and Tenar will be set free in more ways than one.<br /><br />Ursula Le Guin's worldbuilding was masterful in the first book, and it's no less so in \\"Tombs of Atuan.\\" The decayed, corrupted, darkness-obsessed religion and culture that Tenar is raised in seems very real. The only spot of warmth and life is Penthe, a childhood pal of Tenar's, who longs to get away from the temple and go live a normal, happy life.<br /><br />Le Guin's writing is both spare and descriptive; she makes you feel like you know the characters with only a few pages. Her elegantly understated descriptions bring the grey, cold temple and tombs to life. Themes like religion, disbelief, loyalty, redemption, freedom, and enslavement are woven in, but not preachily. The book suffers somewhat when Ged and Tenar are getting to know each other; even during a crisis, Ged spends a lot of time talking about his past and the Ring. It's less a conversation than an infodump.<br /><br />The relationship between Tenar and Ged is the centerpiece of the book. At first they are enemies, then gradually grow to trust one another even though rationally neither one should. Tenar is a strong, brave, slightly immature girl whose spirit has been kept enslaved to the Nameless Ones, and Ged is the brave, gentle, strong wizard we got to know in \\"Wizard.\\"<br /><br />The second book of the Earthsea cycle, while not as strong as the first, is still a compelling book.

While \\"Kiss of Shadows\\" starts off dark and intriguing, the plot rapidly degenerates into a NC-17 fantasy without much more than sweaty gyrations to recommend it.<br /><br />Part-mortal Princess Meredith NicEssus -- undercover as Merry Gentry -- is a P.I. in Los Angeles, which apparently is swarming with fey and fey-wannabes. Keeping her identity a secret is vital, since she knows the dangers that would follow being uncovered. But while investigating a supernatural date-raper (and falling prey to him) Merry's identity leaks out.<br /><br />Before you can say \\"bonk 'em all,\\" she is given an ultimatum by her aunt, the queen of the Unseelie Court: she and her evil cousin Cel are both going to try to have a baby. The one who succeeds will be the next ruler -- the other is toast. Merry is assigned a harem of fae men, all of whom want her as much as she wants them. Physically, anyway.<br /><br />Here's a warning: \\"Kiss of Shadows\\" has a lot of sex. A LOT of sex. A sufficient amount that, among other things, Merry hops in the happy sack with any guy lucky enough to meet her. Oh, and she has a male harem. Sound like an adult movie? Well, it pretty much is -- lots of excuses to have sex, including an enjoyable rape (did a woman really write this book?) and Merry nearly being molested by the entire L.A.P.D. And that's before it gets really raunchy.<br /><br />For anyone hoping for more than soft-porn, the book is lacking. It starts off strong, with a battered woman and a magical want ad, and Merry going undercover to lure out the magic-sucking guy involved. But once she bonks her selkie boyfriend, the plot goes down the tubes. What is worse, the sex obscures the mysterious cultures and subcultures of the fey and sidhe -- Hamilton hints at interesting cultures, rituals and different races, but seems to lose interest in the idea.<br /><br />Without a developed backdrop, the actual plot feels rushed and half-finished. Hamilton also could use a better editor, since her writing quickly becomes repetitive -- lots of hair, unusual eye color, strange powers. All the men are madly attractive, chiseled, and devoid of any individual personality. All the women are beautiful, usually dainty.<br /><br />Merry isn't terribly interesting -- she starts off as a moderately entertaining P.I. with a barbed sense of humor. Then it just sort of fades away. Queen Andais is also moderately interesting, as the villain of the piece. Merry's harem guys have paint-by-numbers personalities, and after the initial introductions they just become a heap of interchangeable sexy bodies.<br /><br />Buried somewhere in \\"Kiss of Shadows\\" is a really good novella, but it's choked by a poorly thought-out soft-porn movie. Hamilton had the right idea, but the execution is a painful \\"Kiss.\\"e idea.   <br />  <br />Without a developed backdrop, the actual plot feels rushed and half-finished.

Despite a rather distant writing style, Le Guin's story is still a classic that is generally put on the same shelf as Lewis and Tolkien.<br /><br />Ged was born in a village in Earthsea -- a grouping of many, many small islands -- in Gont. The boy soon shows signs of great power, the ability to call animals and to laugh even when his tongue has been bound by a spell. A mage named Ogion apprentices Ged--who is known as Sparrowhawk, as knowledge of his true name would give anyone power over him. But Ogion's discipline and lessons are full of silence and self-examination, something which soon sends Ged to the school for mages in Roke.<br /><br />A rival finally mocks Ged into a magical duel, and a monstrous creature made of shadow attacks Ged, nearly killing him. But upon the completion of his studies, the now-wiser wizard sets off to an island to seek the Dragon of Pendor. As the shadow closes in on Ged and his life becomes increasingly imperiled, he must discern what -- and who -- it is, to make himself truly whole.<br /><br />Le Guin's book has a lot of things in it that tend to annoy readers -- several years are skipped in a few pages, and little of Ged's thoughts and emotions aside from \\"Ged felt this\\" and \\"Ged thought that\\" are revealed. But the spare mythic style and quiet philosophical bent add an extra dimension to a straightforward fantasy story.<br /><br />Le Guin's story spans several years in Ged's life, taking him from a little boy in a dirty village to a powerful and respected mage. But she also spins in Eastern philosophy, in the form of the \\"shadow\\" that stalks Ged for many years -- in some ways, the final explanation for what the shadow is seems fitting.<br /><br />Ged has the makings of a classic hero: he is talented and initially hot-headed, but through his misfortunes is tempered into a more selfless, albeit scarred person (both physically and emotionally). Most of the supporting characters don't appear long enough to get much development, although Ged's buddy Vetch comes across as a sweetheart.<br /><br />Ursula Le Guin's \\"Wizard of Earthsea\\" is a memorable story about a boy becoming a man, and a man coming to terms with himself.

But his early family life was marred by Duke's manic-depressive illness, and the question of who his biological father was (he now calls four men \\"Dad\\"). He made his movie debut in \\"The Goonies\\" when he was thirteen, and continued acting in various movies including \\"Rudy,\\" the recent goofy romance \\"50 First Dates,\\" and even created a sweet short film, \\"The Long and Short of It.\\"<br /><br />In 1998, Astin got the role of a lifetime -- Samwise Gamgee, hobbit Frodo Baggins' loyal pal. So Astin gained, packed up his wife and daughter, and went to idyllic New Zealand for eighteen months. In this book, Astin reveals the hardships, the revelations, and the friendships from the vast movie shoot, and what came after.<br /><br />People just looking for more behind-the-scenes movie dirt may be initially disappointed by \\"There and Back Again: An Actor's Tale,\\" since it focuses a lot on Astin's non-\\"Rings\\" life as well. But this isn't just a \\"Rings\\" story -- it's Astin's story. He focuses not just on the \\"Rings\\" trilogy, but on his own struggles and triumphs. And his life story is an interesting read that seems to mirror Astin's own personality: erudite, funny, friendly, sad and family-oriented.<br /><br />But the \\"Rings\\" shoot is pretty fascinating, especially since Astin was right in the middle of it. He gives us a better idea of what his costars were like (Viggo Mortensen likes to \\"blow through a party handing everybody a copy of three different books that he's read, and then move on\\"), and how they felt about him. One particularly interesting part is Astin describing the time ex-Aragorn Stuart Townsend spent on the set, and the reasons why Townsend didn't work out in the role.<br /><br />Astin frank and candid, doesn't whitewash the truth, but also seems quite generous with his costars. Sometimes he comes across as a bit whiny and know-it-all-ish, but he's also the first one to admit it. Everyone has their arrogant moments, but Astin is brave enough to bare his unflattering mistakes before the world, and say he was wrong. And his writing (with Joe Layden as coauthor) is polished and literate -- not something you see in many Hollywood autobios.<br /><br />Astin also includes a load of personal pics. Most of them have a very laid-back, almost intimate feel -- the hobbits and their costars hanging out, showing off their costumes, bungee jumping, or filming (including Elijah Wood covered in webbing). Not to mention ones like Billy Boyd playing with Sean's daughter, or Sean and his daughter looking over the beautiful landscape of New Zealand.<br /><br />Sean Astin gives readers a glimpse of his life and work in \\"There and Back Again: An Actor's Tale.\\" It's not merely for fans of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" but also for fans of Astin and the moviemaking experience.ey felt about him.

Her lush prose and vivid characters turn the dramatic plot and strange scenarios into a chilling look at good and evil, thankfully without melodrama.<br /><br />In modern times, a young man is interviewing a vampire on tape recorder. The vampire is Louis Pointe du Lac. In 1791, his ultra-religious brother died tragically after an argument, and Louis sank into remorse and despair. Enter Lestat de Lioncourt, a charming vampire who offers Louis a way out of his grief.<br /><br />The two vampires wander the cities of the world, with Lestat teaching his reluctant pupil the ways of vampirism. In time Louis makes a \\"daughter\\": Claudia, a vampire child with the mind of a woman. Now, depressed and unhappy, Louis explains how he and Claudia fled Lestat, only to encounter new tragedies that still haunt him to this day...<br /><br />Moral struggles are rarely present in vampire novels.

His longing to remain as human as possible, in defiance of his curse, is a tragic twist in a dark storyline.<br /><br />Louis is a bit of a whiner, but a deeper look reveals why. He struggles with morality and beliefs that -- unlike Lestat -- he never really let go of. Because he is a vampire, he is by his very nature a killer, yet the idea of murder is repulsive to him.

Tolkien, Charles Williams, Owen Barfield and Their Friends	Books	3	11	14	N	N	Top-heavy "Inklings"	The Inklings were a legendary group of writers in the mid-2th century, now primarily known as the drinking gang of J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. In \\"The Inklings Handbook,\\" Colin Duriez and David Porter do a good job of illuminating several dark corners of the Inklings' history, but they sway too heavily in Lewis and Tolkien's direction.<br /><br />The book opens with several essay-chapters: the history of the Inklings as a group and an Inklings chronology spanning eighty years. There are also some brief studies of Narnia, Middle-Earth, and some obscure Arthuriana written by Inklings members. And, of course \\"Theology and Fantasy In the Inklings\\" -- with Lewis and Tolkien in it, what else could there be?<br /><br />But these essay chapters (plus the introduction) aren't enough to fill up even fifty pages. So Duriez and Porter provide an Inklings encyclopedia of sorts, with alphabetical entries detailing the lives of the inklings, their creations, several books, their friends and influences. Some are absolutely bizarre (Aleister Crowley?), but several are very useful, such as the summaries of Lewis' lesser-known books.<br /><br />It's a given that when people hear about the Inklings, they immediately think about Tolkien and Lewis. It's only natural -- they are the most famous out of the whole bunch. As a result, most fans of these two authors will already know quite a bit about their lives and work.<br /><br />But it's a little disheartening to see that Duriez and Porter lean too heavily on these two writers, retelling information about Tolkien and Lewis that any knowledgeable fan knows. Owen Barfield and Charles Williams are given secondary importance, and quite a few details about them and their work are revealed. But what about J.A.W. Bennett or Lord David Cecil? Barely a paragraph is given to the \\"lesser Inklings,\\" no matter what they did or how much they wrote.<br /><br />Duriez does have an excellent style, relaxed and flowing easily from one topic to another. His research with Porter into obscure scholarly works and undertakings -- such as Williams' translation of the Aeneid -- appears to be quite detailed, and offers quite a few interesting summaries of various books, and of people who encountered the Inklings, such as mystery writer Dorothy Sayers.<br /><br />While it doesn't shed much light on anyone except Tolkien and Lewis, \\"The Inklings Handbook\\" does shed quite a bit of light on the Inklings' works and creations, including ones other than Narnia and Middle-Earth.o another.

Barron created a sweeping fantasy classic in the \\"Lost Years of Merlin\\" series. Now he follows up with a brand new series, taking place eight hundred years after the creation of Avalon -- \\"The Great Tree of Avalon: Child of the Dark Prophecy,\\" full of magic, chills and humor.<br /><br />As the book opens, legendary wizard Merlin rescues an orphaned eagleboy from a pair of mercenaries, and gives him to a flamelon woman with a half-human baby. He also leaves his staff with the eagleboy. The boys are raised together, but are separated when a pack of evil creatures try to kill them. Now Tamwyn is on the hunt for his brother Scree, but is haunted by questions about his own past. There's a prophecy that that year, both Merlin's true heir (and grandson) and the Dark Child of a sinister prophecy will come of age that year.<br /><br />Elsewhere, a young priestess named Elli is accompanying her snobby superior to a meeting with the Lady of the Lake. They end up meeting with Tamwyn, who is beginning to believe that Scree is Merlin's heir -- and that he himself is the Dark Child. But an evil sorcerer is threatening all of Avalon, disrupting the magical waters that sustain it -- and Tamwyn, Elli and Scree may be the only ones who can save their homeland.<br /><br />It's hard to take the story almost a millennium forward, with an almost entirely new cast and new problems. But \\"Child of the Dark Prophecy\\" has a certain familiarity, since Barron explores themes of good, the potential for evil, doubt, power and love -- just as he did in the \\"Merlin\\" series.<br /><br />One thing that hasn't changed is that Barron's writing is vibrant and lush, without getting bogged down in the details. Not to mention his healthy doses of humor, such as the snotty priestess's face being turned green by her facial. There are strange creatures, ranging from little shapeshifting imps to giant mud-dwellers.<br /><br />The one flaw may be the villain; his motives are excellent, but they aren't even hinted at until the final showdown. But, for clarity's sake, Barron also includes a detailed timeline that explains the events of the past eight hundred years, including the marriage of Merlin and deerwoman Hallia, and the war that precedes this conflict. This is very helpful, although don't read it until the book is over.<br /><br />Familiar faces pop up here and there. Merlin himself appears for only a short time; the Lady of the Lake turns out to be an old friend, and half-deaf Shim shows up again (tiny once more). A familiar evil character also returns late in the book. But the book belongs to Tamwyn, nervous about his possible destiny and his growing magical powers, and fiery Elli, with her haunted past. Though initially they despise each other, their friendship starts to grow. Eagleboy Scree doesn't get as much attention -- he spends most of the book in a cave -- but he's an excellent character when he reencounters his brother.<br /><br />Beautifully written and full of thrills, \\"Child of the Dark Prophecy\\" is a worthy follow-up to the \\"Lost Years of Merlin\\" series, yet will leave readers longing for the next book in the series.

472385:US	50881246	RP8QFLRL5KA4R	0375422986	960033606	The Sunday Philosophy Club : An Isabel Dalhousie Mystery	Books	2	63	81	N	N	Dull "Sunday"	Alexander McCall Smith caught the public fancy with his No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, but he hits his first stumbling block as soon as he leaves Africa. The Scottish author tries to set a novel in Scotland, but the story ends up being as tedious and dreary as the grey weather.<br /><br />Isabel Dalhousie is a refined, philosophical Scottish lady who lives alone in an elegant home of her own. Her days are filled with editing, her philosophical club, and philosophy, and trying to get niece Cat married to Mr. Right. Unfortunately, she gets an extra chore when a young man falls in a concert hall. Murder most foul? Isabel thinks so.<br /><br />Snopping around, Isabel uncovers illicit activities that the young man was involved it, and which might have led to his death. So she juggles the moral quandaries of the mystery, while trying to rearrange Cat's love life (she's dating the \\"wrong\\" guy), and uncovers a nest of potential suspects.<br /><br />Along with the sunshine of Africa, the life seems to have gone out of McCall Smith's writing. His first books were pleasant enough light mysteries. But his delving into Miss Marple's domain is just flat -- too little plot, not enough substance attached to that plot.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest problem is that McCall Smith seems determined to tackle the moral questions and ethical dilemmas of this book. And he's just not up to the job. The character of Isabel reflects the nature of his writing here -- pretentious and unaware that it is.<br /><br />The sprawling philosophical debates take up large chunks of time... but since the plot is rather bland, it's no great loss. McCall Smith's writing has that spare charm that the Precious Ramotswe books possessed. However, it can only carry his story so far, and cannot disguise the fact that there is zero suspense and not a great deal of mystery.<br /><br />Most detectives are either quirky or gritty. Isabel is clearly meant to be quirky, but merely comes across as annoying and meddlesome, a mopey divorcee with too much time on her hands. Strangely, the club of the title has absolutely no bearing on the story -- it seems to have been chosen because it sounded good.<br /><br />Agatha Christie, this ain't. The genteel charm of Alexander McCall Smith's prose is what keeps \\"Sunday Philosophy Club\\" from being an utter disaster.

One of Ray Bradbury's relatively few books for children is a wildly imaginative ride, with a strong subtext about friendship and death itself.<br /><br />Eight young boys congregate to go trick-or-treating on Halloween night; the only one missing is Pipkin, the universal favorite (Bradbury devotes an entire chapter to singing Pip's praises). Pipkin does show up, but he acts strangely and isn't wearing a costume. When they show up at the House, a haunted edifice, they find the sinister, skeletal Mr. Carapace Clavicle Moundshroud and an enormous tree hung with jack-o-lanterns -- a Halloween tree. Pipkin appears nearby, and then is carried off into the darkness.<br /><br />To save Pip, Moundshroud takes the boys on a strange trip through time and space, through history and across the world. He shows them the death-related rituals that spawned Halloween: Egypt's mummies, the Celtic Samhain and its lord of the dead, the Christian All Hallows Eve, the Mexican El Dia De Muerte, and others. Through time and across the world, they chase Pipkin and try to save him -- but what can they do against death?<br /><br />Halloween books are generally the realm of the under-eight crowd. At a certain point in life, it's just hard to recapture that magic -- it's like a darker version of Christmas. But Ray Bradbury, who has been captivating people with his dark-edged fantasy for years, presents a uniquely gothic, uplifting story in this book.<br /><br />Ray Bradbury's deft touch keeps this particular story from becoming too leaden and heavy-handed. Kids will be fascinated by the origins of Halloween, a holiday now relegated to candy and costumes; the descriptions of different cultures and what helped shape the Halloween we know today are handled excellently. He also does not become judgemental about any of the cultures, such as ancient Romans, Celts, and Christians, but merely presents how civilizations rise and fall, and how their traditions linger on.<br /><br />None of the boys are really developed too intricately, and remain simply young brave boys who are willing to go through the fire for their friend. Mr. Moundshroud is alternately sinister or kindly: considering who he turns out to be, the sinisterness is not surprising, but he also sympathizes with the boys and allays their fears. The writing is excellent, almost dreamlike, with the sort of delightful overkill that characterizes really good spinechillers. The descriptions of the House and the Halloween tree are the best examples of this.<br /><br />\\"Halloween Tree\\" succeeds in being a good fantasy, a good spinechiller, a good glimpse back in history, and an excellent story about friendship all in one.

Heaven, hell, purgatory and so on. In \\"The Portable Dante,\\" that sprawling supernatural epic is paired with his exquisite love ode, \\"La Vita Nuova.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Divine Comedy\\" is the story of Dante's guided tour through the three parts of the afterlife: Hell, where he is shown (by the poet Virgil) how the sinners are tormented in all sorts of inventive ways, depending on their sins. Purgatory, \\"the second kingdom,\\" where Dante sees the suffering that people undergo to be purified of their wrongs. And finally paradise, where his beloved muse Beatrice shows him heaven, encountering his ancestors, angels, saints, and finally God himself.<br /><br />\\"La Vita Nuova\\" (The New Life) is only loosely connected with the \\"Comedy.\\" It tells of how Dante met Beatrice when they were both children, and he fell in love with her. Many years passed, and Dante's quiet adoration of Beatrice grew stronger, even though they married other people. The story follows his emotional ups and downs, and the writings that resulted... even when Beatrice died.<br /><br />The main similarity between these two books is that they both feature (and adore) Beatrice. \\"La Vita Nuova\\" is an intimate little book, but the \\"Divine Comedy\\" sprawls all over Earth, the solar system (within the bounds of \\"paradiso\\"), and the three parts of the supernatural realm. You can't get much more epic than that.<br /><br />Dante's writing remains rich and detailed, even translated into English. The descriptions of heaven and hell are mind-blowing, and sometimes the \\"Inferno\\" sections are even funny. Yes, hell is funny. But he also excels in describing his inner highs and lows in \\"La Vita Nuova,\\" as he struggles with doubts, sorrow, anguish and joy.<br /><br />But don't think that Dante's journeys are merely supernatural. While \\"La Vita Nuova\\" doesn't describe much beyond art and love, \\"Divine Comedy\\" also tackles religion and politics. It's a bit uncomfortable when Dante describes various people he disliked in hell. And he also takes the opportunity to criticize the Catholic chuch of his time, which had quite a few problems. However, his fervour for his religion, Beatrice and his art shine through.<br /><br />\\"The Portable Dante\\" is an excellent way to check out Dante's most prominent works.

While Frost's \\"voice\\" is a bit unformed in these poems, the rich ponderings of nature and love are never stronger, full of \\"sun-saturated meadows,\\" November-loving girls, and pearly streams.<br /><br />\\"I should not be withheld but that some day/Into their vastness I should steal away,\\" Frost announces in his first poem. He follows up this statement with everything from eerie story-poems (\\"Love and a Question\\") to exultant (\\"A Prayer in Spring\\") to melancholy meditations on nature's beauty, love, and broken hearts.<br /><br />Poets take awhile to reach their peak, and Frost was still starting out in \\"A Boy's Will.\\" That said, it's astounding how good he was even in his first volume of poetry (though at times the rhymes are a little too simple, and the subjects don't vary much). Most striking is Frost's passion -- his enthusiasm, sorrow and thoughts seem to spill off the page.<br /><br />What really makes Frost's poetry come alive is his descriptions of nature -- one poem is entirely devoted to a moonlit search for a brook, since the well has gone dry. Sylvan god Pan even makes a cameo in one poem, an enjoyable little bit about Pan surveying an uninhabited forest. However, he ventures out of the woods from time to time, such as the stirring historical poem \\"In Equal Sacrifice,\\" about Douglas carrying Robert the Bruce's heart to the Holy Land.<br /><br />\\"A Boy's Will\\" is a stirring -- though very short -- collection of Robert Frost's poetry, and has the prestige of introducing this poet to the world. While Frost's poetry still had some growing pains, its beauty and richness make up for any flaws.	2004-10-27
475985:US	50881246	RX584R3WLAEMX	1594130043	669379389	The Return of the King (Lord of the Rings, 3)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	The grand, bittersweet finale	\\"Return of the King\\" is the worthy climax to J.R.R. Tolkien's epic saga, the fantasy that created the genre as we know it today. Now, as the blockbuster movie adaptation is over, many readers are checking out the dramatic story that ends Tolkien's masterpiece and life's work.<br /><br />The story opens where \\"Two Towers\\" left off. Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives.  And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.<br /><br />In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?<br /><br />Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline, one by one. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel;  Tolkien shows that in a struggle against evil, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.<br /><br />This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Aside from Frodo's emotional deterioration, we also have Merry becoming almost catatonic after the battle with the Witch King, and Denethor's descent into suicidal madness. There is a lot less humor, though it is still there: Pippin and Merry both thinking about food, Gandalf's reaction when Pippin pledges his sword to Denethor, some choice witty comments of Frodo's in the last chapters, and Gimli's half-joking threats to axe Eomer if Eomer doesn't consider Galadriel the most beautiful woman in the world.<br /><br />Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, and of course the bittersweet final scene.<br /><br />Frodo is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down by the pressure of the Ring, to the point where he seems to be only a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Yet these actions make chilling sense, even when Frodo recovers his self-control only a moment later. It's a devastating demonstration of the hold the Ring has on him; he tries to resist it while knowing that he's falling too far into its grasp. When he lapses into depression and nihilism, readers will wonder if he can actually give it up.<br /><br />Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves. This book has him chasing orcs with Sting, carrying Frodo physically through Mordor, fending off Gollum, and acting as the ultimate pillar of strength for his crumbling friend right to Mount Doom.  Merry is exposed firsthand to the horrifying consequences of war,and Pippin moves past his initial flakiness in an effort to be a serious warrior. Aragorn breaks completely from the mold of rugged ranger and into the new status as a king, leading armies (both living and dead) without flinching.<br /><br />As far as the supporting cast goes, Legolas and Gimli assist as well; their friendship grows deeper, even as Legolas falls completely in love with the sea. Gollum's degenerate journey remains intertwined with Frodo's, even though he betrayed the hobbits in the previous book; and the icily passionate war-maiden Eowyn affects the War of the Ring in a stunning way that nobody could have predicted.<br /><br />The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. Another good addition is \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of LOTR can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following LOTR.<br /><br />It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants. But as Gandalf says, \\"I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\\"and Pippin moves past his initial flakiness in an effort to be a serious warrior.

Despite a rather distant writing style, Le Guin's story is still a classic that is generally put on the same shelf as Lewis and Tolkien.<br /><br />Ged was born in a village in Earthsea -- a grouping of many, many small islands -- in Gont. The boy soon shows signs of great power, the ability to call animals and to laugh even when his tongue has been bound by a spell. A mage named Ogion apprentices Ged--who is known as Sparrowhawk, as knowledge of his true name would give anyone power over him. But Ogion's discipline and lessons are full of silence and self-examination, something which soon sends Ged to the school for mages in Roke.<br /><br />A rival finally mocks Ged into a magical duel, and a monstrous creature made of shadow attacks Ged, nearly killing him. But upon the completion of his studies, the now-wiser wizard sets off to an island to seek the Dragon of Pendor. As the shadow closes in on Ged and his life becomes increasingly imperiled, he must discern what -- and who -- it is, to make himself truly whole.<br /><br />Le Guin's book has a lot of things in it that tend to annoy readers -- several years are skipped in a few pages, and little of Ged's thoughts and emotions aside from \\"Ged felt this\\" and \\"Ged thought that\\" are revealed. But the spare mythic style and quiet philosophical bent add an extra dimension to a straightforward fantasy story.<br /><br />Le Guin's story spans several years in Ged's life, taking him from a little boy in a dirty village to a powerful and respected mage. But she also spins in Eastern philosophy, in the form of the \\"shadow\\" that stalks Ged for many years -- in some ways, the final explanation for what the shadow is seems fitting.<br /><br />Ged has the makings of a classic hero: he is talented and initially hot-headed, but through his misfortunes is tempered into a more selfless, albeit scarred person (both physically and emotionally). Most of the supporting characters don't appear long enough to get much development, although Ged's buddy Vetch comes across as a sweetheart.<br /><br />Ursula Le Guin's \\"Wizard of Earthsea\\" is a memorable story about a boy becoming a man, and a man coming to terms with himself.

Now with the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It has quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it, set the tone for most fantasy ever since, topped many \\"best book\\" polls, and helped spawn such entertainment phenomena as \\"Star Wars.\\"<br /><br />Following up on events in \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" stars the quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.<br /><br />\\"The Two Towers\\" begins directly after \\"Fellowship,\\" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them. His cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs from the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.<br /><br />\\"Return of the King\\" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.<br /><br />\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.<br /><br />Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual. Merry and Pippin start out a bit flaky, but are matured by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue ranges from goofy and hilarious to solemn and archaic, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary; if you don't have a good attention span, then you won't be able to handle this story. If you do, then probably you can.<br /><br />The fiftieth anniversary version is, simply put, a gorgeous edition-- the binding, cover, golden edges and slipcase are smooth and well-made. The illustrations and expansive fold-out maps are good accompaniments that only serve to make the book feel more complete. It's expensive, but for a truly exceptional addition this is a good choice.<br /><br />Even after all the years, J.R.R.

Tolkien's fantastical epic \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is only the tail end of his invented history.<br /><br />Yes, Tolkien spent most of his adult life crafting the elaborate, rich world of Middle-Earth, and coming up with a fictional history that spanned millennia. And \\"The Silmarillion\\" was the culmination of that work -- a Biblesque epic of fantasy history, stretching from the creation of the universe to the final bittersweet departure of the Elves from Middle-Earth.<br /><br />A complete summary is impossible, because the book spans millennia and has one earth-shattering event after another. But it includes:<br />*The creation of Tolkien's invented pantheons of angelic beings under Eru Iluvatar, also known as God.<br />*How they sang the world into being, and the creation of Elves, Men, and Dwarves (hobbits are not really covered).<br />*The legendary love story of Beren and Luthien, a mortal Man and an Elf maiden who gives up her immortality for the man she loves.<br />*The attempts of the demonic Morgoth and his servant Sauron (remember him?) to corrupt the world.<br />*Feanor and his sons, and the terrible oath that led to Elves slaying one another.<br />*The Silmarils, the glorious gems made from the the essence of the Two Trees that generated the world's light.<br />*Elves of just about any kind -- bad, mad, dangerous, good, sweet, brave, and so forth.<br />*The creation of the many Rings of Power -- and the One Ring of Sauron.<br />*And finally, the quest of the Ringbearer, Frodo Baggins, and the final battle that would decide the fate of Middle-Earth.<br /><br />If you ever were confused by a reference or name mentioned in \\"The Hobbit\\" or \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" then chances are that \\"The Silmarillion\\" can enlighten you about what it meant. What is Numenor? Who are the Valar? Who is that Elbereth Gilthoniel that people keep praying to? How did the Elf/Dwarf feud originally begin? And how exactly is Elrond related to Aragorn?<br /><br />For the most part, it focuses on the Elves and their history, especially where it intertwines with the history of Men -- although Dwarves and Hobbits don't get nearly as much ink devoted to them. But in that story, Tolkien weaves together stories of earth-shattering romance, haunting tragedy, gory violence, good versus evil, the rise and fall of cities and kingdoms, and much more.<br /><br />However, it's not really written like Tolkien's other works. It's more like the Bible, the Mabinogion or the Eddas. Tolkien didn't get as \\"into\\" the heads of his characters here, and wrote a more detailed, sprawling narrative that would have needed countless books to explore in depth.

Someone who had a lack of enthusiasm could not have spent much of his adult life writing, revising, and polishing a history that never was. It's also almost frighteningly imaginative and real: It isn't too hard to imagine that these things could actually have happened.

But those who appreciate the richness and scope of Middle-Earth should examine \\"The Silmarillion,\\" a sprawling fictional history full of beauty, tragedy and love. A work of literary genius.	2004-10-24

This is one trilogy that almost lives up to the words -- a majestic, magical adventure that spans all of McKillip's richly invented world.<br /><br />\\"Riddle-Master of Hed\\" opens with the discovery of a jeweled crown under Prince Morgan's bed -- a sign that he outriddled a king who had never been defeated before. Along with the crown, he wins the right to marry his pal's sister, Raederle, the second-most beautiful woman in the continent of An. But Morgan is stopped on his way by a shipwreck and news of something dark and sinister creeping into the lands. Strange shapeshifting creatures are entering the lands, the wizards have vanished from the land, and somehow the three stars on Morgan's brow are connected to their presence and how to stop them. He heads off to Erlenstar Mountain, to find the High One -- and finds more than he bargained for...<br /><br />\\"Heir of Sea And Fire\\" very slowly resolves the cliffhanger ending of \\"Riddle-Master,\\" focusing instead on Princess Raederle. The land-rule -- a sort of sixth sense given to kings -- of Hed has passed to Morgan's brother, meaning that apparently Morgan is dead -- but Raederle and her father don't believe it's true. She sets off with a few faithful friends, and encounters the semi-sinister harpist Deth, the shapechangers, armies of the dead rampaging through her father's lands -- and disturbing news about her and her heritage.<br /><br />\\"Harpist in the Wind\\" continues from the end of \\"Heir,\\" with Morgan and Raederle planning what to do next. Strange rebel armies -- of both the living and the dead -- are massing in Ymris, and Morgan is taking the dead armies to Hed in an attempt to protect it. Then he and Raederle set off to find the High One and wring some answers out of him -- only he may not be what they expect. As Morgan grows in power and gains knowledge about all of An, he strips bare the secrets of the High One, the shocking identity of the shapechangers, and begins a new age for the lands...<br /><br />There was never a less cliched author than Patricia McKillip -- the scope, majesty and richness of her invented world rival the best of the genre. Her plot twists and turns inside the lush, dreamlike prose that she's so good at, making a snowstorm as eerie as a magical showdown that can redefine an entire world's magic.<br /><br />Her plot can be seen in two ways, as the growth of a naive young prince into a wise paragon of power, and also about the shifting of a land from one era into another. The Four Portions of An are a detailed, real-seeming fantasy world, and her princes, wizards, ghosts, and harpists are wise, sometimes sinister, mysterious and full of power.<br /><br />Morgan is an excellent hero, who is not arrogant or desirous of the power that he is gaining. As confused by his own destiny as by the events around him, he spends much of the first book resisting his fate. Raederle is an excellent counterpart to Morgan, afraid of her heritage and fiercely determined to follow him wherever he goes. They are not a perfect couple: they bicker and argue occasionally, but they do not allow divisions to sit and fester. Deth is the ultimate ambiguous character, keeping you guessing until the end about what the heck is going on with him.<br /><br />There are no elves, dwarves, fairies, gnomes, or similar fantastical creatures in this book. It came to me with a bit of a shock at the end that aside from the shapechangers, there were only humans in this -- humans who can learn magic, who make mistakes and who have to search for the truth instead of having it handed to them on a plate. The magic is startlingly eerie, subtle and pervasive rather than being flashy. Similarly, the shapechangers' menace isn't overdone -- much of their creepiness results from the question of what they are, and why they are doing what they do.<br /><br />The complexity and depth of McKillip's early trilogy is still striking today. Her rich invented world and haunting, complex tale of magic, wizards and riddles make \\"Riddle of Stars\\" (now republished as \\"The Riddlemaster Trilogy\\") a modern fantasy classic.y and depth of McKillip's early trilogy is still striking today.

But de Botton surpasses it with his sophomore effort \\"The Romantic Movement,\\" an intricate study of love, sex, relationship, psychology and literature.<br /><br />Eric is older, more chic, richer and a seasoned professional. Alice begins to be attracted to him immediately, and equally quickly they become lovers. In the first flush of the relationship, they seem to adore and treasure one another. But soon cracks begin to form in the relationship, unbalancing Alice.<br /><br />Eric seems to take her for granted, and has a tendency to attack people who are sensitive, crippled, weak, physically unattractive, etc. Alice, who clearly suffers from self-esteem problems, often blames herself for Eric's inattentiveness and temper tantrums, until she begins to see that his flaws are a part of him.<br /><br />De Botton name-drops everyone from Descartes to Rousseau in this book, but seems more comfortable than he did in \\"On Love.\\" It's essentially the same story -- boy meets girl, boy and girl get into relationship, personalities clash, someone breaks it off, cycle begins anew. But here de Botton polishes out the story's progression, and adds a slightly more upbeat ending.<br /><br />His twining of philosophy and psychology with fiction is a lot more assured this time around. Rather than interrupting the story with long sprawls of intellectual pondering, he weaves them into the story. And he uses more of his wry sense of humor, such as the comment that Madame Bovary essentially killed herself because she shopped too much. (Flaubert plays a big part in his analysis of love, such as the religious-love theory)<br /><br />Alice can be a bit annoying throughout most of the book -- she's sweet and loving, but rather clueless. It's satisfying to see her snap out of it, and realize why her relationship won't work. Eric comes across as a jerk, but de Botton does give him good qualities as well. And Philip comes across as being Alice's potential One And Only.<br /><br />Take the same old story, and mix in shopping, sex and philosophy, and you have \\"The Romantic Movement.\\" Alain de Botton improves on his first book with this strangely touching, wryly intellectual story.ork.

Name-dropping everyone from Julian Barnes to Anais Nin, Darcy Cosper's debut novel ends up an empty, bitter-tasting mess.<br /><br />Joy is fiercely anti-marriage, but somehow has gotten roped into being a bridesmaid/guest at seventeen weddings in six months: A debutante wedding, two gay commitment ceremonies, a Web-based wedding for an open marriage, and weddings for her brother, mother, and father.<br /><br />Then Joy's boyfriend Gabe drops a bombshell -- he wants to marry her. Without really thinking about it, she accepts. But she also has to deal with her lesbian friend Henry's possible breakup, her pal Joan's breakdown, and the possibility of her boyfriend cheating on her with a sexy, sly memoirist. Does Joy really want to get married after all?<br /><br />It's easy to see \\"Wedding Season\\" as a novel about how some people are happiest when unmarried, and how singleness is not a disease. Sure, happiness can't be bought in a little velvet box. But dig a little deeper into the book's message. How independent can a woman be if her determination to remain unmarried is based in a bunch of childhood neuroses and fears? Not very inspiring.<br /><br />Cosper's writing isn't anything to write home about. Her thin plot is worth about twenty pages, so she stretches it out with the seventeen weddings -- several of which are glossed over -- and a dozen subplots. But half the subplots lead nowhere, and the main plot itself putters to an unsatisfying halt.<br /><br />Despite being called a \\"comedy of manners,\\" there's nothing remotely witty or intelligent in this story. The author apparently harbors some bitterness towards marriage, and therefore trots out many arguments against it. So it's not witty, not intelligent -- it's merely a preachy tract, wrapped inside quirky anecdotes about chaotic weddings.<br /><br />Joy herself is a wretched character -- stodgy, peevish, and neurotic. Worse, Cosper has her acknowledge her neuroses, but not overcome them -- at the end, she's as messed-up and fearful as ever, and has treated her long-suffering boyfriend like a doormat to boot. Other characters like the gay brother, the good girl, the neurotic mom and gorgeous boyfriend are merely cardboard cutouts. The only likable character is lesbian pal Henry; despite her over-the-top personality, she's the sanest person in the whole book.<br /><br />The neurotic bitterness and preachiness of \\"Wedding Season\\" spoil what could have been a fun light romp.

Alain de Botton seems to be trying to incorporate both into his wittily literate \\"On Love: A Novel,\\" but his writing leans too far in one direction and fails to really be engaging.<br /><br />On the Paris-London plane, a young man falls instantly in love with a beautiful girl sitting near him. He tracks her down in London, and tries his best to win Chloe over. Soon they are visiting her parents, making love in front of a mirror, and telling each other loving lies over a wonderful breakfast.<br /><br />But their affection for each other is not complete. Chloe doesn't want to move in. He hates her taste in shoes, jam, and reading. The first blush of love fades away, leaving them to notice that they are essentially incompatible. They bicker, drift apart, and gradually Chloe ditches the loser -- and after an unsuccessful suicide attempt, the cycle starts over.<br /><br />\\"If the fall into love happens so rapidly, it is perhaps because the wish to love has preceded the beloved....'' Or so says the unnamed narrator, as he first sees Chloe. De Botton gives some interesting insights into crushes, long-term love and what it takes to make a relationship work -- the relationship between Chloe and the narrator doesn't work because of dishonesty, both to each other and to themselves.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest problem with \\"On Love\\" is that while Alain de Botton shows us a love affair that is essentially based only on emotion, he doesn't let any of that feeling seep through. The look back on the relationship has little warmth or anger -- it's all coldly analytical, as it studies the anatomy of love, and name-drops half the philosophers known to civilization.<br /><br />If the story were more robust, it might warrant the richly overblown philosophical ponderings. But it's a very ordinary story, with very ordinary occurrances, and so the ponderings on the Jesus Complex and Plato seem like someone obsessing on minutiae. It's certainly literate and sometimes quite funny, and de Botton does have some intriguing points -- does a person fall in love because they want to? Do you fall for someone because they are beautiful, or are they beautiful because you are in love?<br /><br />The narrator is a bit of an idiot, and not a terribly sympathetic one -- he seems petulant and immature (throwing a tantrum because Chloe doesn't have \\"decent\\" jam?), and he doesn't learn from his mistakes. Chloe comes across as far more sympathetic -- she's enthusiastic, sweet-natured, and most of her problems stem from the narrator. Okay, she's uncultured, but she deserves better.<br /><br />A philosophical anti-romance novel, \\"On Love\\" is a mixture of wit and first-time awkwardness.

So it's a rare experience to come across both in such quantity as there is in \\"La Vita Nuova\\" (\\"The New Life\\"), the unsung masterpiece of poet Dante Alighieri, author of the classic Divina Comedia. This is, simply put, an ode to his muse and love.<br /><br />\\"La Vita Nuova\\" is a series of poems and anecdotes centering around the life-changing love of Dante for a young woman named Beatrice. The two first met when they were young children, of about eight. Dante instantly fell in love with her, but didn't really interact with her for several years. The two married others, but those spouses are paid no attention.<br /><br />Over the years, Dante's almost supernatural love only increased in intensity, and he poured out his feelings -- grief, adoration, fear -- into several poems and sonnets. During an illness, he has a vision about mortality, himself, and his beloved Beatrice (\\"One day, inevitably, even your most gracious Beatrice must die\\"). Beatrice died at the age of twenty-four, and Dante committed himself to the memory of his muse.<br /><br />It would be a hard task to find another book overflowing with such incredible love and passion as \\"La Vita Nuova\\". It's probably the most romantic book I have ever seen. It's brief and only includes one part of Dante's life overall, but it's a truly unique love story -- especially as Dante and Beatrice were never romantically involved. In fact, both of them married other people.<br /><br />But Dante's love for Beatrice shows itself to be more than infatuation or crush, because it never wanes -- in fact, it grows even stronger, including Love manifested as a nobleman in one of Dante's dreams. There is no element of physicality to the passion in \\"La Vita Nuova\\" -- Dante talks about how beautiful Beatrice is, but that's only a sidenote. And Dante's grief-stricken state when Beatrice dies (of what, we're never told) leads him to deep changes in his soul, and eventually peace. And though Beatrice died, because of Dante's love for her and her placement in the \\"Comedia,\\" she has achieved a kind of immortality.<br /><br />One of the noticeable things about this book is that whenever something significant happens to Dante (good, bad, or neither), he immediately writes a poem about it. Apparently that was his way of dealing with his emotions. Some readers may be tempted to skip over the carefully constructed poems, but they shouldn't. Even if these intrude on the story, they show what Dante was feeling more clearly than his prose.<br /><br />It's virtually impossible to read this book and come out of it jaded about love or true passion. Not the sort of stuff in pulp romance novels, but love and passion that come straight from the heart and soul, in a unique and unusual love story. Every true romantic should read this book.hanges in his soul, and eventually peace.

The prose is a bit plain and not terribly descriptive, but the plot and the sparkling characters are, as always, absolutely stunning. \\"Archer's Goon\\" is an underrated, weird little mystery involving wizards, writers, and spaceships.<br /><br />Howard Sykes comes home one day to discover that an enormous Goon (small brain, big feet, limited vocabulary) is sitting in his kitchen, claiming that unless his dad Quentin produces two thousand words to \\"Archer,\\" they will be in serious trouble. Turns out that Quentin promised a mysterious man two thousand words every three months, in exchange for no more writers' block. And the problem is, when the Goon shows up again and announces that the words didn't get through. Quentin swears he won't write another word, and the Goon remains in their house (he's not supposed to leave without the words).<br /><br />Things immediately go haywire: Howard and his sister Awful soon discover that Archer is one of seven very pushy, devious wizards that \\"farm\\" the town they live in -- there's criminal Shine, tantrum-throwing Torquil, sewer-ruling Erskine, and a bunch of others. If Archer gets the two thousand words, he'll rule the world (or \\"farm\\" it, as they say it), but if he doesn't then any of his siblings could. What do they need the words for? And how can a pair of kids defeat a bunch of very determined wizards -- especially when some people aren't quite who they seem?<br /><br />Diana Wynne-Jones is one of the best fantasy authors out there (well, she bumped into Lewis and Tolkien -- that has to be a sign), and while \\"Archer's Goon\\" is not her best, it's pretty high on the list. It's funny, cute, and seems very simple at first, but rapidly becomes very, very complex. The biggest problem is that in this book -- especially in the opening chapters, the writing is very stark and undescriptive, although it becomes much more descriptive later in the book. But the dialogue is still that great humorous Brit style, especially whenever someone talks to the Goon.<br /><br />Howard is a nice (slightly bland) hero, very like a real adolescent boy in that he botches things and isn't sure what to do when his parents fight. Awful seems that way at first, but behind the insane shrieking she has a brain. The Goon is the biggest triumph of this book -- he initially seems like a simple lunkhead troll-type, but he's really a nice guy. The wizards are almost as good -- some are faking, and some are honest, and it's nearly impossible to figure out what is going on in their heads.<br /><br />\\"Archer's Goon\\" is an early Diana Wynne Jones, back before Jones had reached her full potential.

In her second autobiographical book, the \\"Big Dog\\" turns the focus from her life to herself and her career -- and while at first it's a big loop of trashy enjoyment, her irritating personality taints it all.<br /><br />In \\"Everything,\\" Dickinson presents plenty of the nasty behind-the-scenes details of the modelling world, like eating disorders, sleeping one's way to the top, and lots and lots of airbrushing. She also gives detailed tales of who slept with her, who wanted to sleep with her, and the assorted dates she had with adoring male celebrities. Not to mention tips on how to banish wrinkles (which have only sort of worked).<br /><br />Janice starts off with some basic stuff about supermodels, all anecdotes focused on her not eating, posing in bathing suits in zero-degree weather, and pouting sexily. Then, when she apparently run out of material, she decides to give women relationship tips straight out of a dominatrix's handbook (\\"Get him while he's down: throw salt in his wounds...\\") and gives us details of her many affairs, including a rather icky fling with Rolling Stone Mick Jagger.<br /><br />While \\"Everything\\" is fun for awhile, Janice herself gets annoying. Not only is she extremely self-centered, but some of her stories have a hint of fantasy about them. The men -- Mick Jagger, Donald Trump, Bruce Willis, JFK Jr., three-fourths of the Beatles -- all worshipped her, and all the women either adored her, or were nasty and are promptly cut to bits by Janet's oh-so-witty cattiness. Everyone tells her how beautiful, sexy and wise she is.<br /><br />Gals of normal body size should skip certain chapters: Apparently idolizing the body and industry of her long-ago youth, Dickinson also takes the opportunity to lob a few size-ist barbs at the plus-size models of today. Apparently in her mind, only androgyne waifs (as she once was) are allowed to be models. And when talking about some girls who were late to a modelling show, she comes dangerously close to squawking, \\"When I was your age...\\"<br /><br />The most publicized aspect of \\"Everything\\" has been Dickinson's plastic surgery, and that actually doesn't take up a lot of time -- she goes in to get a bunion removed, and gets new breasts.

Amazingly, according to some of the latest pictures in this book, all the surgery did was make her eyebrows slant like Spock's.<br /><br />Janice does have a small number of interesting stories to tell, like the gossipy story of how Mick Jagger snubbed her when she was pregnant, and how she overcame booze and drugs.

489976:US	50881246	R2I5GCTASM9VLN	0974029092	492528729	1: Silverlance	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Solid adventure fantasy	Written in a hermitage in Ireland, \\"Silverlance\\" is a solid debut for new fantasy writer Peter T. Crowell. The book overflows with rapid-fire action and sparkling writing. It could have used a bit less action and more character focus, but the result is still a spectacular debut.<br /><br />Young satyr Byron Thorn is having his mischievous fun on his Misrule's Day, which happens to be Midwinter's Day. But things take an unexpected twist when a star appears in the sky -- the \\"clarion\\" of legendary hero Silverlance. Before he's sure what's happened, Byron is hustled off to find Silverlance, with his reluctant centaur pal Dindra trying to protect him.<br /><br />But some people don't want Silverlance to return -- including Ravinoth, a malevolent centaur sorcerer who is determined to kill Byron and Dindra. The two pick up an array of friends -- including dryad brothers, a wolf king, a dwarf and a girl who talks to animals -- as they follow the star toward Silverlance, taking refuge in a priestess's land. But Ravinath is determined to stop the hero's return -- and only Byron and his friends can find Silverlance.<br /><br />Peter Crowell puts a few twists in the typical quest fantasy: the hero is a powerless satyr kid, the goal is a person, and there's a lack of Tolkienesque cliches. No secret kings or ancient swords. Just a well-written fantasy story, full of monsters and mythic creatures, and with a bit of distinct C.S. Lewis flavor. Not to mention openings for more stories.<br /><br />Crowell's writing is very polished and sparkles with description. It's somewhat too heavy on action, though -- a few more scenes focusing on the characterization would have smoothed things out. He sprinkles the text with Greek mythic creatures -- centaurs, satyrs and dryads. Even the minotaur makes an appearance, not to mention the wolf called \\"Lukos.\\" And he fleshes out the story with an intriguing back-story of war and magic, complete with dragons and unicorns.<br /><br />Byron is a likable kid, with the usual legends spinning in his head, but discovering that the reality is not quite as thrilling as he thought. Some of the characters introduced later in the story (like Nosh) needed a little fleshing out, but all the supporting characters were likable and pretty realistic. Ravinoth is a suitably evil villain, especially since Crowell keeps him out of the picture much of the time -- it makes him seem even more menacing.<br /><br />Peter Crowell's debut is a solid fantasy story, with good writing and a steady storyline packed with action.

Sick for most of his life, Masaoka became one of Japan's most prominent poets at the turn of the century, and his influence on tanka and haiku remains to this day. \\"Songs From a Bamboo Village\\" not only displays some of his poetry, but offers insights into his life and work.<br /><br />Translators Sanford Goldstein and Seishi Shinoda (both professors) open the book with a detailed biography of Shiki -- a passionate poet, whose strong artistic mother encouraged his education. He wasn't just a poet, but also a columnist who used his \\"A Drop of Chinese Ink\\" to let his thoughts be known, whether they were thoughts on late 19th-century Japanese poetry, or a comic letter from guardian deity Jizu.<br /><br />But his ill health both destroyed him and became one source of his inspiration; but it couldn't hold back his determination to revitalize Japanese poetry until his death. Even when he was dying, his sister helped him write. At the end of the book, the translators also offer several pages of translation notes, which offer insights into Masaoka's poetry, the times in which his lived, and the reflections of his life in his work.<br /><br />Then we are shown some of Masaoka's beautiful tanka poetry -- some is focused on nature, some on emotion, and some are just reflections on little bits of life, such as the tanka that comments on which persimmons are the sweetest. Some even have a humorous bent, such as \\"Vowing not to return/without performing my duty/I head for the front/my portable brush and ink case/stashed swordlike in my belt!\\"<br /><br />Masaoka's writing is minimalistic at times, though often he reflected on the color of a flower or the contents of a bag. However, his poetry serves as an excellent window into his thoughts, whether they were happy, sad, or merely reflections of his own failing body. \\"This iris flowers/have come out/and before my eyes/is passing/the last spring I will see,\\" he wrote at one point.<br /><br />More than a mere collection of poetry, \\"Songs From A Bamboo Village\\" displays the talents and life of a rare man, whose passion for his art and life were sadly cut short.

That's the dilemma that Will Starling has to deal with. \\"The Witches of Chiswick\\" abounds with humor and excellent ideas, but they're loosely tied together in a sloppy plot.<br /><br />Will Starling lives in a future era where art is virtually nonexistant, and the obese populace lives in a stagnant, self-satisfied way. Will is an oddity -- he works at an art museum, is slim, and has an interest in the Victorian era. But the discovery of a digital watch in an 18th-century painting turns Will into a fugitive -- soon a bunch of Victorian cyborgs are killing anyone named Will Starling.<br /><br />Will gets the help of his friend Tim, who tell him that someone is trying to hide the truth about the Victorian era -- it was actually full of technology and magic. It's also ruled over by a coven of witches from Chiswick Townswomen's Guild, who are now trying to kill Will. What ensues is a mad, reality-twisting chase involving Jack the Ripper, a talking sprout, Queen Victoria and the Elephant Man (who is actually a \\"human-alien hybrid spy\\").<br /><br />Robert Rankin has a lot of wickedly weird ideas. He also has humor in abundance -- I mean, the church of IKEA? As evidenced in his light but amusing \\"Hollow Chocolate Bunnies of the Apocalypse,\\" Rankin could be the next Terry Pratchett. He has joke after joke, some of them subtle but others ragingly obvious, and hysterically funny. Just the ideas he comes up with are wickedly funny in themselves.<br /><br />Unfortunately, about a third into his book, everything unravels. Rankin is at his best when he has a simple, straightforward plot with plenty of odd side-streets, but here he tries something major, complex and sometimes philosophical... and the result is that it spins out of control, tearing itself full of plot holes. And despite Rankin's announcement that there is no deus ex machina, that's more or less what he does.<br /><br />Will and Tim are pretty much the only characters given any depth -- Will the odd boy out, who doesn't fit into his world, but would fit nicely into ours. And Tim is even odder -- a websurfing pagan with a liking for weird discoveries, such as Captain Nemo's Nautilus on the bottom of the North Sea. Most of the supporting characters, like Will's parents and legendary mage Hugo Rune, aren't really given much development.<br /><br />There's so much promise in the bizarre SF/fantasy \\"Witches of Chiswick.\\" It's sad that Rankin wasn't quite up to the complex plot he tried to weave underneath all the humor and wild fantasy.that's more or less what he does. <br /> <br />Will and Tim are pretty much the only characters given any depth -- Will the odd boy out, who doesn't fit into his world, but would fit nicely into ours.

As they do, they reflect on their tangled, messy past -- including the fact that son Wade slept with his stepmother Nickie, then got shot by his father Ted, striking his mother Janet. Now Janet and Wade have AIDS, and Nickie is HIV positive.<br /><br />To make things worse, downbeat brother Bryan shows up with his anarchist girlfriend Shw, who is pregnant. She claims she's going to abort, but has secretly arranged to sell her child to a seemingly ordinary couple. And Ted has prostate cancer. In the few days before Susan's launch, the bizarre extended family wrangles out some of their old arguments, and learns a few new things about themselves.<br /><br />Every author stumbles, and consider \\"All Families Are Psychotic\\" as Douglas Coupland stubbing his toe. It's not exactly a bad book, but it lacks the complexity and wry wit that most of his books have. He tends to do modern sociology well, while this mainly seems like a soap opera gone completely mad.<br /><br />Coupland populates this world of his with insane hippies, amorous astronauts and suicidal musicians. So you can guess that there's plenty of trouble. The scenarios are mostly pretty funny, such as the mad chase for a letter to Princess Di, although they get a bit over-the-top sometimes. However, Coupland slows the pace for some insightful looks at America, family and the shattering aftereffects of divorce.<br /><br />The characters lack dimension -- specifically, they lack the \\"likability\\" dimension. Only the jilted Janet is likable, as she steps out of the \\"dutiful housewife\\" mold and becomes her own person. The others are almost good characters, but Coupland never gives us a reason to really like any of them -- even the thalidomide-deformed (and married) Susan is having a fling with her (also married) mission commander.<br /><br />While it's grim a lot of the time, \\"All Families Are Psychotic\\" has sprawling flashes of wit and peculiar humor.

Witty, unpredictable and full of Coupland's little flickers of bitterness and sweetness.<br /><br />Things start to go awry when ex-hippie Jasmice wakes up with \\"divorce\\" written on her forehead. Ambitious twenty-year-old Tyler is a living anti-hippie, devoted to hair-care, sleek technology and big corporations. He considers Jasmine the living figure of sixties idiocy, but he consoles his mother about her rotten husband's departure.<br /><br />As he comforts Jasmine, he contemplates his own life, his sweet girlfriend Anna Louise, and his oddball family, which was based in a weird hippie commune when he was little. Things in Tyler's life are disrupted when the haughty Stephanie, a summer fling, comes to visit -- and stay. Tyler travels with his fling-turned-new-girlfriend to California, but finds himself more alone than he has ever been before.<br /><br />In this book, Coupland takes a look at a small group of people -- young, intelligent college graduates who aren't sure whether to follow their dreams, or chain themselves to a big corporation. Don't worry -- it's not half as boring as it sounds. Coupland keeps the book vibrant with snotty Europeans, scraggly ex-hippies and the offspring they drive crazy.<br /><br />Theme aside, Coupland has a way of tugging at the heartstrings, without becoming really sentimental, and reminds us that \\"the time you feel lonely is the time you most need to be by yourself.\\" His writing is sharp, solid and strangely evocative of a split world: half sand candles and flowers, half leather furniture and big-screen TVs. And he has a unique sense of humor -- he doesn't make readers really laugh, but just exposes the absurd side of things.<br /><br />Tyler starts off superficial and rather snotty, and he spends much of the book doing the wrong thing. But Coupland makes him grow up slowly, making him see the worth of people he thought were freakish before. Not to mention his long-suffering girlfriend Anna Louise, who is obviously The Girl for Tyler. Jasmine is a very real portrait of an aging hippie -- full of life and sweetness, yet incredibly naive.<br /><br />Douglas Coupland's \\"Shampoo Planet\\" tackles some of the same turf as \\"Generation X,\\" yet it gets more intimate and sweet than his first novel did.

Barron's \\"Child of the Dark Prophecy,\\" it seems appropriate for the \\"Lost Years of Merlin\\" series to be rereleased as a box set. Beautifully written and laced through with Celtic myths, T.A. Barron's five book cycle is a thrilling fantasy ride that fills in the gaps of Merlin's youth.<br /><br />In \\"Lost Years of Merlin,\\" a young boy washes up on the coast of Wales, with no memory of who he is. A few years later, the blinded Merlin leaves the woman who claims to be his mother, to find out where he came from. He ends up on the magical isle of Fincayra, with a sprightly woodland girl called Rhia. But the evil Rhita Gawr is threatening to destroy the life of the island -- and may destroy Merlin as well.<br /><br />\\"The Seven Songs of Merlin\\" opens where the first book left off. Merlin is determined to bring his mother, Elen, to Fincayra. But his magic attracts the attention of Rhita Gawr, who wants both mother and son dead. Soon Elen lies fatally ill, and Merlin has only one month to find a magical potion that will save her life. To do it, he will have to master the Seven Songs, and travel into the Otherworld...<br /><br />As \\"The Fires of Merlin\\" begins, Merlin is relaxing with his mother and his sister Rhia, and honing his skills as a wizard. But he soon learns that things are about to get nasty -- he's being followed by creatures that suck away magic. Worse, he learns of a prophecy that he will fight the legendary dragon Valdearg, whom his grandfather defeated long ago. The problem is... neither he nor Valdearg will survive the battle.<br /><br />\\"The Mirror of Merlin\\" dips into T.H. White territory. Merlin and his beloved Hallia head into the Haunted Marsh to find a missing sword. They find a young boy, Ector, lost in the marshes. But then Merlin is infected with the bloodnoose -- which will split his head in half if he can't find a way to stop it. Desperately, he accompanies Ector to find the boy's master -- and learns that the master is none other than the elderly Merlin himself.<br /><br />\\"The Winds of Merlin\\" brings the series to a shattering climax. The spirit lord Dagda warns Merlin of the possible destruction of Fincayra. To protect Fincayra and defeat Rhita Gawr, Merlin must join together all of the peoples of that land -- but he must battle the dark figures from his past, who now have returned to see him dead.<br /><br />Few fantasy series are as beautifully made as the \\"Lost Years\\" series. T.A. Barron takes his love of nature and a handful of Celtic legends, and blends them into an action-packed, magical fantasy. Not to mention a wicked coming-of-age story. Barron's writing is detailed and full of lush description, ranging from the barren wastelands to beautiful forests to the ghostly Otherworld.<br /><br />And his characters are even better drawn -- Merlin is full of doubt and confusion at first, but he slowly gains strength and power. By the end of the series, it's not hard to imagine him as the wise old wizard. Supporting characters like Rhia and Elen are also well done, while the villains are given motives and reasons for acting as they do (revenge, saving their family).<br /><br />T.A.

Tolkien was a prolific writer -- not just in creating the sprawling sagas of Middle-Earth, but also in writing letters, notes, and introspective studies of literature and religion. \\"The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien\\" is a surprisingly entertaining read, and an invaluable source for figuring out Middle-Earth's history, and Tolkien's writing.<br /><br />His letters start off with notes to his beloved Edith, before they got married, when he was in the army. After only fifteen pages, correspondence with publishers starts (regarding the publishing of \\"Mr. Bliss\\"), and continues with details about his writing, illustrations, and plans for future writings. \\"[The created legend] should be 'high,' purged of the gross, and fit for the more adult mind of a land long now steeped in poetry,\\" he writes at one point.<br /><br />But letters to publishers are only some of the letters Tolkien wrote in his long life. Other letters are to his kids and his friends, detailing his trip to Italy, the Narnia books, his friendships, his career, the nuances of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"Beowulf,\\" and explaining his thoughts on philosophy, religion, myth and his own writing -- even describing an aborted sequel to \\"Lord of the Rings\\" called \\"The New Shadow,\\" which he abandoned as being \\"both sinister and depressing.\\"<br /><br />Do hobbits have pointy ears? Did Sauron create the orcs? Were the evil spiders inspired by a childhood tarantula bite? Was the Ring of Power \\"der Nibelungen Ring\\"? Tolkien addressed all of these in his letters. (And the answers are: Yes, no, no, and absolutely not!) Rumors are addressed, questions are answered, and Tolkien gives insights to his writings that -- obviously -- no one else could provide.<br /><br />And unlike in a lot of compiled-letters books, Tolkien's own personality seems to shine through his letters -- intelligent, imaginative, immersed in his faith, work and family, and capable of being quite snippy when he wanted to be. His letter to Allen & Unwin about a \\"Dr. O\\" is particularly funny (\\"Coming home dead without a head... is not very delightful\\"). While Tolkien's style seems very formal at first, it's easy to get immersed in his longer letters. The shorter ones are usually quite short -- one is only two lines long, announcing that \\"I shall be murdered if something does not happen soon.\\"<br /><br />And while Tolkien answered intelligent questions with extensive responses, he didn't seem to like untrue rumors. When Dr. O claimed that the Ring was \\"der Nibelungen Ring,\\" he responded dryly that: \\"Both rings were round, and there the resemblence ceases.\\" Touche, professor. He also shows an endearingly humble attitude towards his work, even calling his charming drawings \\"ill-drawn.\\"<br /><br />J.R.R.

A close pal of J.R.R. Tolkien's and a fellow \\"Inkling,\\" C.S. Lewis was one of the first widely-read fantasy writers, and his books are still widely read and enjoyed by children and adults alike.<br /><br />\\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" opens as four children (Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter) are being shipped to the English countryside at the beginning of World War II. While exploring the vast house where they are staying, Lucy accidently ventures into a winter-locked world called Narnia, which is ruled over by the evil White Witch. The king Aslan is about to return -- but the Witch quickly gets a hold on Edmund's soul.<br /><br />\\"Prince Caspian\\" takes place long after the events of \\"Lion\\" (though in our world, only a short time has passed). Young Prince Caspian escapes his uncle's castle when his life is threatened, and he finds refuge with the hidden races of Narnia -- dwarves, talking animals, dryads, centaurs and many others.  And to help Caspian regain the throne, the two kings and two queens of Narnia are called back...<br /><br />\\"Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\" begins when Edmund, Lucy and their obnoxious cousin Eustace are sucked through a painting into Narnia, where their pal Caspian is now king of Narnia (and an adult to boot). Caspian is heading toward the end of the world to find several knights who were banished, and vanished into the perilous islands along the sea.<br /><br />\\"The Silver Chair\\" heads into slightly darker territory when Eustace returns to boarding school. He and outcast girl Jill Pole are drawn into Narnia, where Jill must perform a task to redeem herself for a stupid act. She must find the dying Caspian's son Rilian, who vanished many years before. The search will send the two children across Narnia with the pessimistic Puddleglum, to carnivorous Giants, creepy underground creatures, and an enemy worse than they could have imagined...<br /><br />\\"Horse and His Boy\\" shoots back in time to the middle of \\"Lion.\\" Shasta lives with the man he thinks to be his father in a hovel by the sea, but when a Calormene warrior purchases him, he escapes with the man's talking horse, Bree. He meets the escaping noblewoman Aravis (who also has a talking horse), and the two are planning to escape to Narnia and freedom. But in the capital city, there is a conspiracy brewing against the visiting Narnian kings and queens...<br /><br />\\"Magician's Nephew\\" clears up many of the questions about Narnia, Aslan and the White Witch. Digory and Polly end up in very serious trouble when they encounter Digory's weird, slightly nutty uncle, a magician who has created magical rings that send the user to other worlds. The two kids end up in the \\"wood between the worlds,\\" and venture into a dying land where they set loose the evil Queen Jadis -- who follows them to the newborn world of Narnia.<br /><br />\\"The Last Battle\\" is definitely the end of the series, where Narnia decays slowly into the final battle between good and evil. Humans are destroying the trees and killing the dryads, and a false Aslan is appearing to mislead the inhabitants of Narnia. Old and new friends will band together as the true Aslan prepares to lead them to a new land.<br /><br />If you don't like allegory (religious or otherwise), then steer clear of the Chronicles. While Lewis's beliefs are presented in a more complicated and subtle manner in his other fictional works, here the parallels to basic Christian beliefs are very obvious. Reportedly even Tolkien, one of Lewis's best pals, found the allegory annoying.<br /><br />But if you can get past the slightly ham-handed treatment, it's a fantastic read. Lewis reshapes typical mythical elements like dwarves, nymphs, talking animals, centaurs and wicked witches into shape in his invented world. And Narnia is an inviting place -- it isn't always fun or pleasant, but there is always the feeling that the good guys will ultimately -- if not immediately -- come out on top.<br /><br />Lewis's writing can become a bit precious at times, in the tradition of many British authors writing for children. But he puts plenty of detail and mystery in his stories, sprinkling them with little mysteries and questions that are explained as the story goes on. Where did the lamppost come from, for example?<br /><br />While not quite as well known as his pal Tolkien's work, C.S. Lewis's Narnia series still a fun and dramatic fantasy story.

About 150 pages, large print, and vast parts of Vanderbilt's life are skipped -- her childhood is about five pages long. As a result, this book seems like half a biography -- just the juiciest bits, with all non-romantic details carefully snipped out.<br /><br />But really, what could be more exciting than a lifetime of love and passion? Quite a few things -- Vanderbilt's \\"love\\" rarely seems to get beyond an elongated crush; she developed interest in several men due to seeing them on movie screens. If she developed a crush, she pursued it, and usually got burned. Crushes are normal in a thirteen-year-old, but not so normal in an adult woman. Vanderbilt consistently puts her men on pedestals, then blames them if they don't live up to her hopes -- and time has not taught her that this is a bad idea.<br /><br />And Vanderbilt's ultra-rushed writing isn't too great either. Instead of detailing important parts of her life and affairs, she just crams as many in as possible. She gives little personality to legendary men like Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra -- they and all her other paramours melt into a bit featureless blob. Yes yes, she loved them all -- she still makes them all boring. At one point she burbles about how much she loves her late son Carter, yet barely mentions him in the book until he took the high-dive out a window. (So much for her criticism of her mother for a lack of maternal love!)<br /><br />Gloria Vanderbilt fails miserably at writing a juicy tell-all -- instead it's a bloodless list of how many men she dated, slept with, and married. In the end, it's something you'd expect from a sixteen-year-old heiress... but not one born in the Roaring Twenties. Tepid, annoying, and unromantic.a bit featureless blob.

Beautiful and sensitive, this lacks the passion of \\"Praise,\\" but has a mellow charm of its own.<br /><br />Hass ponders his childhood, and the childhood of the US: visions of the Franciscan priests coming to California, and bringing illness with them -- \\"They meant so well, she said, and such a terrible thing/came here with their love...\\" He looks back on his mother, on his father's death, and his bond with his brother in college. Not to mention \\"Sonnet,\\" as a man listens lovingly to his ex-wife's voice.<br /><br />But don't think that Hass only contemplates family. He also fixes his eye on nature -- weather, plants, animals, mountains, and the almost magical web that surrounds them in his writing. Even when writing a gritty piece on an airstrip, \\"Layover,\\" he pauses to describe the \\"snowy mountains,\\" \\"moose feeding along the frozen streams/snow foxes hunting ptarmigans...\\" His infatuation with nature peaks in the exquisite \\"Woods in New Jersey,\\" and the dreamlike \\"Iowa City: Early April.\\"<br /><br />Good poets are remembered, while mediocre ones are usually forgotten quickly. Robert Hass is one of the former. His descriptions of love, loss and nature are striking and beautiful, and in that \\"Sun Under Wood\\" is not a change. It's an evolution -- rather than the fire and passion of his earlier works, this is a quieter, meditative collection.<br /><br />The peak of his writing in \\"Sun Under Wood\\" is \\"English: An Ode,\\" an apparent tribute to the power of words. It seems fragmented even for free-style poetry, but as it's read it makes more and more sense -- it explores words, their roots, their meanings, and their evocations, only to end on a distinctly romantic note. It also seems quite appropriate, since his poetry is so evocative. Without having to use dramatic words, Hass brings to mind snowy woods, noisy tarmacs, a tearful eye or a creek fringed by fronds.<br /><br />Hass's writing has changed over time, and \\"Sun Under Wood\\" is a polished, contemplative collection of beautiful poetry.

She doesn't change much in \\"The Au Pairs,\\" except that it's aimed at teenage girls craving a story about designer labels, boys, sex, and beach parties. It's a vaguely interesting brief story, but not much more.<br /><br />Three girls arrive in the Hamptons, destined to be au pairs for a wealthy family over the summer. There's Eliza, whose father's shady dealings destroyed her Park Avenue life -- and she's determined to get it back. There's Jacqui, a beautiful South American pursuing a gorgeous American boy who lives in the area. And small-town girl Mara is simply dazzled by her surroundings -- and her employers' hunky son, Ryan.<br /><br />They soon find that being an au pair is a pain -- men think of them as being slutty, kids are difficult, and sculpted stepmoms ignore the kids and hired help alike. But as Eliza mingles with her old pals -- hiding that she is now poor --  Jacqui discovers the ugly truth about her \\"Luca,\\" and Mara is torn between her domineering white trash boyfriend and the handsome, sensitive Ryan. (No, I can't believe she actually dithers about this either) Cue the parties, Gucci and underage cocktails!<br /><br />\\"The Au Pairs\\" is basically a mix of \\"Gossip Girl\\" and the \\"Nanny Diaries,\\" but without \\"Diaries's\\" wit and sweetness. It's a predictable beach read for girls not yet in a job, and probably unable to imagine more typical chick-lit's career gripes. It's fluff, essentially, and not a great deal more.<br /><br />It's also quite predictable -- we know that Jacqui will learn the truth about Luke, that Mara's goody-two-shoesness will win the day, and Eliza will learn that (gasp!) money doesn't matter. De La Cruz's writing is okay -- not bad, not good, not witty and not stupid. It's middling, without a lot of descriptions beyond the occasional makeout scene.<br /><br />None of the three girls are too bright -- I mean, what sane woman would wear designer clothing around little kids who projectile-vomit? Neither are they very appealing. De La Cruz portrays Jacqui as an unrepentant manipulator, and Eliza as shallow and rather twerpy. Mara is even worse -- she's nice. Boringly nice. Nice in a reality-challenged way. And she will certainly bug strong-minded girls by agonizing about her knuckle-dragger boyfriend.<br /><br />\\"The Au Pairs\\" might be a good light read while girls wait for their nails to finish drying. But otherwise it's lightweight and predictable -- typical chick-lit, except with less likable characters.-- I mean, what sane woman would wear designer clothing around little kids who projectile-vomit?

It seems somehow appropriate that Laurell K. Hamilton's worst Anita Blake novel to date is called \\"Narcissus in Chains\\" -- a tepid, kinky exercise in literary self-worship, chained by adoration of the author's lookalike lead.<br /><br />Anita Blake returns from a six-month sojourn, but her love life is no simpler than it was before. And that her pal Nathaniel has been snared into a dangerous S&M club. To save him, she calls on her sort-of-lovers Richard the werewolf and Jean-Claude the vampire. And they \\"marry the marks,\\" making Anita more powerful than she ever dreamed.<br /><br />But a fight in the club leads to Anita being in danger of becoming a wereleopard, and Jean Claude is arrested. Richard captures the wereleopard. So when Anita wakes, she not only finds that her friends are in (or causing) trouble, but that she now has the intense craving for constant sex called the \\"ardeur\\" from Jean Claude.<br /><br />Of all literary devices in fantasy, \\"ardeur\\" may be the absolute worst. After a relatively solid fantasy/horror series, Hamilton delves into a device that porn writers would be embarrassed to use. But unfortunately, long pages of clinical sex scenes are only a few of the problems that \\"Narcissus in Chains\\" has. It's simply a poorly written book.<br /><br />Hamilton appears to have thrown her writing ability out the window, in favor of  constant Anita-worship. (This seems even weirder when you see that Anita strongly resembles the author) The dialogue loses its sting in favor of descriptions of Anita's clothes, weapons, the genitalia of her assorted sex partners, and the passionless pages of coitus that she bounces through. The prose is turgid and slow-paced, as if Hamilton didn't bother having it edited.<br /><br />Anita herself fast becomes an annoyance -- not only is she endowed with powers as big as Micah's member, but she has a newfound arrogance that grates on the reader. Not to mention an apparent willingness to be quasi-raped by her apparent soulmate. Jean-Claude and Richard start off strong, but as the ardeur strikes they begin acting oddly. Leopard king Micah is basically a gigolo for Anita's personal pleasure.<br /><br />\\"Narcissus in Chains\\" lacks the qualities of good fiction -- even of good romance. Hamilton stumbles through a silly, turgid plot, leaving tatters of the characters' personalities in her wake. A ghastly mess.as a newfound arrogance that grates on the reader.

But new novelist Andrea Seigel tackles a strange death wish in \\"Like the Red Panda,\\" and makes it funny too. Incisive, sharp-edged and smart, this look at the final two weeks of high school for a girl who is far and away the wisest person in her community.<br /><br />Stella is brainy, pretty and wise beyond her years, about to graduate from high school. Up until this week, she was planning on going to Princeton -- now, she wants to die before she gets there. She deliberately flunks tests, ponders her teachers, and contemplates the absurdity of schoolwork (bouncing imaginary balls) and classmates (while befriending the class weirdo).<br /><br />As the school year winds down, Stella visits her bedridden, emotionally abusive grandfather -- discovering that they have more in common than she thought.  She also ponders the loss of her parents when she was eleven, an event that shaped her personality from then on, and the colorless life she has had with her nervous foster parents. In those two weeks, Stella decisely works on how to best leave the world, observing as it moves past her.<br /><br />While \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" is referenced from time to time -- including the observation that you'd want to strangle Holden in real life -- Stella is a wholly different person. This story is a morbid comedy, where \\"Catcher\\" is more of an angry-young-man/coming-of-age tale. And it's that very mix of wit and darkness that makes \\"Like the Red Panda\\" so exceptional -- few authors could handle such a plot without making it trite or maudlin.<br /><br />Rarely could cocaine/heroin ODs be considered romantic or amusing. But Stella ponders the weird romantic streak in her parents' deaths (their \\"hearts snapped in tandem\\") at her eleventh birthday party. She looks back on them -- and her life -- with a mix of honesty and affection. She's not heartless, just brutally honest about herself and the world.<br /><br />Seigel does display some first-time difficulties -- she climaxes Stella's problems with her foster parents by having an awkward blowup. And Stella's relationship with her drug-dealing boyfriend seems tacked in. However, her prose is wonderfully written, with a sort of detached grace as Stella observes the little things, from sex to religion. Sprinkled in are wry observations, like the Jewish temple that her foster parents go to: services are held on Sundays, because \\"this benefited cross-religion plan-making on the weekends.\\"<br /><br />Stella is not a female Holden clone -- where Holden is resentful, she is quietly brutal. She's witty, wry and thoroughly engaging for smart, philosophical young women. Her foster parents are pale characters, especially when compared to her exuberant druggie parents. And her classmates and teachers are gifted with little quirks and oddities, but not to the point of being caricatures.<br /><br />\\"Like the Red Panda\\" is an excellent first novel for Andrea Seigal. Rather than going into \\"angry young woman\\" territory, she opts for a funny, dark, strange journey into Stella's mind.

So it was a bit of a surprise to see a totally different perspective in \\"Be My Sorority Sister: Under Pressure,\\" a book that takes a look at the struggles and friendships of a well-known sorority.<br /><br />Eva Perkins's mother and sister both were in Beta Gamma Psi Sorority, so when Eva enters Edwin Carver University, she's desperate to enter the mostly African-American sorority. After struggling in pre-pledging activites, Eva finds herself on line to become one of the girls -- but soon finds that the sorority can be a lot tougher than she thought.<br /><br />The \\"older sisters\\" are rough to the point of being abusive on Eva and the other new girls, and there is internal strife among the older girls. One ex-pledgee even writes a scathing tell-all article. But the worst thing happens when a girl falls from a rooftop during a pledge ritual, and abrasive Connie lies to the police about what happened. But no one knows how far the lie will go -- or how it will threaten the existance of their sorority.<br /><br />Dorrie Williams-Wheeler crafts an enjoyable light read for teens, maybe giving them something to look forward to in their college years. Not to mention a warning -- Williams-Wheeler doesn't skimp on the abusive hazing rituals, which aren't limited to physical abuse. She doesn't dip into paddling (despite the cover) and similar black'n'blue abuses, but she does mention them. But she also takes care to mention the friendships and bonding that come from the sorority's teamwork.<br /><br />Her writing style is a bit bare and un-descriptive for my taste, but it moves along at a brisk clip. And the dialogue-heavy writing seems like listening in on the girls at the sorority; there are some spelling and grammatical errors, but nothing too major. She also has a talent for making the feel of the book grow tenser and more frightening -- the main flaw is that the final two chapters feel VERY rushed, packing too much into too few pages. Ms. Williams-Wheeler should have stretched it out for several more chapters.<br /><br />Eva is an unusual lead character -- rather than making her a goody-two-shoes, Williams-Wheeler gives her flaws and internal conflict about the goings-on at the sorority. The supporting girls are pretty well-done, with individual quirks and flaws. And the older girls range from the nasty Connie to the likable Cassidy.<br /><br />Even those who haven't yet tackled the subject of sororities might be interested in \\"Be My Sorority Sister: Under Pressure.\\" It might give you a look at what to look forward to -- and avoid -- on a sorority.ain flaw is that the final two chapters feel VERY rushed, packing too much into too few pages.

Her debut novel, \\"In the Drink,\\" is a passable chick-lit book with a vaguely Bridget-Jones air. Amusing in places, but nothing special. Yet.<br /><br />Claudia Steiner is creeping up on the big 3-oh, but has none of the security that most women her age have. She's mired in a ghostwriting job for a kiss'n'tell socialite, she has no money, and her love life is in tatters -- pursued with a married man who is unhappily married to a Romanian stripper. Oh yes, and Claudia is in love with her best male pal, the might-be-gay William. (Why she stays in Manhattan is not entirely clear)<br /><br />But Claudia hits bottom when her boss Jackie becomes too much to deal with, her mum drops in to fight with her, and she's in danger of eviction from her roachy apartment. Suddenly she finds that she has to pull herself up by her bootstraps, even as she finds that Jackie and William have their own secrets hidden behind them.<br /><br />Christensen's take on loser lit is an amusing one, no doubt. And her wickedly dark sense of humor pops up in places where Helen Fielding never even dreamed of -- like Claudia's almost obsessive love of whiskey, or William's rather un-shocking, naughty secret. (Here's a hint -- it involves whips) Not to mention the quippy narrative and fast speed.<br /><br />But it doesn't quite succeed in spoofing loser lit -- it's too close to the real thing to be an urban-lit satire. In places it's depressing where it ought to be funny. And the characters -- boss from hell, annoying family members, depressed young woman, male best friend who she longs for -- are standard chick-lit/loser lit people who fit easily into their slots.<br /><br />Claudia is something of a loser, she knows she's a loser, and she doesn't seem too inclined to rise above loserdom. You'll sympathize with her... yet want to smack her. Jackie is a riot as the aging debutante who has Claudia write her steamy books, and provides much of the book's humor. William is a likable dark horse who serves as a good counterpoint to Claudia.<br /><br />Kate Christensen's \\"In the Drink\\" has the feeling of a first-time novelist still feeling her way around.

First book \\"The Summer Tree\\" is an entertaining read, but Kay was clearly still getting into the idea of writing an original book.<br /><br />Five college students are chatting with a visiting professor, Lorenzo Marcus, who is accompanied by a peculiar dwarf. Suddenly the mysterious man reveals that he is a mage, Loren Silvercloak, and whisks them all into the world of Fionavar. He asks them to come stay awhile -- but none of the students know the strange destinies that bind them to Fionavar. Worse, one of them -- Dave -- vanishes during the crossing.<br /><br />The four friends soon learn of the sinister political and supernatural problems in Fionavar. An evil wolf is lurking around, and the evil svart alfar are killing the beautiful lios alfar (elves). Suddenly sweet-natured Jennifer is kidnapped and tortured by the evil god, the Unraveller. And Paul offers his own life for the sake of Fionavar -- to be hung on the Summer Tree as a human sacrifice.<br /><br />Take the world-crossings of Narnia, and the mythic qualities of Tolkien. That pretty much describes \\"Summer Tree.\\" It's not terribly original, and the plot doesn't really work until about halfway through the book. But it hints at future grandeur, and makes good use of its old Celtic legends and customs in a typical fantasy setting.<br /><br />The biggest flaw of \\"Summer Tree\\" is unoriginality -- Kay lifts ideas from Robert Zelazny and J.R.R. Tolkien, and combines them with a heavy dose of Celtic mysticism and a bit of Arthurian legend. Sure, these are hardly unusual -- but it's hard not to flinch at a lios alfar describing his people to Jennifer. It's an exact description of Tolkien's elves, down to a copy of the Undying Lands.<br /><br />Kay's writing is exceptional, however -- lush, detailed, and rich. He can enspell you, or horrify you. Most compelling is Jennifer's rape -- Kay doesn't get graphic with the details, but her horror and violation are ghastly. At the same time, descriptions of the lios alfar, visions, spells and the strange creatures that populate Fionavar are almost intoxicating. The scenes were Paul hangs on the tree are stunning and powerful.<br /><br />One small problem is that Kay seems to have a little trouble with his lead characters -- he's a little too eager to get them into their respective places. None of them seem very disturbed over being snatched into another world, and expected to become a part of it. And the college students are actually the flattest people in the whole book -- the kindly king, womanizing prince, stern wizard and vindictive priestess come across as much more real.<br /><br />There are deep flaws in \\"The Summer Tree,\\" but its luxuriant prose makes it a worthwhile read.

Tolkien drew extensively on old myths and legends. But the \\"Tolkien Fan's Medieval Reader,\\" compiled by Turgon, lets Tolkien fans get their eager hands on some of the legends and poetry that inspired his works.<br /><br />Tolkien's love of medieval literature was especially strong for epics like \\"Beowulf\\" and the Norse Eddas, which were sprawling mythologic poems and legends. (Try to see how many Tolkien dwarf names you can find in the Poetic Edda) But Turgon -- who is one of the sweet folks on exceptional Tolkien site TheOneRing.net -- doesn't stop there.<br /><br />He includes other old English tales, and some Middle-English stories like \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\\" and parts of \\"The Canterbury Tales.\\" He also includes an excerpted story from the Kalevala, an ancient Finnish text credited with part of the inspiration behind \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" And to round it out are some Celtic stories, such as the Welsh Mabinogion, and the early story of \\"Kilhwch and Olwen,\\" which was also the first Arthurian story.<br /><br />Okay, all these stories are in the public domain -- obviously something written in the thirteenth century can't pull in royalties. But Turgon's compilation does serve a purpose: bringing together a bunch of old texts that fans may have heard of, but probably have never actually read. It's not a replacement for the real thing, but serves as an introduction.<br /><br />Since language changes over time, and some translations are a bit rough, Turgon has smoothed out the old linguistic wrinkles. Nothing that really changes the meaning, but enough to keep readers from going \\"Huh? What's that word mean?\\" Small introductions to each story or excerpt are included, describing how these stories were important to Tolkien's work, and how they inspired his world of dragons, dwarves, elves and human heroes.<br /><br />In a nutshell, Turgon has compiled and edited a solid introduction to the works that inspired Middle-Earth. Fans of the legendary trilogy will love the splendor and richness of these old books -- and might just learn something about J.R.R. Tolkien's writing in the process.as compiled and edited a solid introduction to the works that inspired Middle-Earth.

Well, when viewing an opera, it's a good idea to check up on the plot beforehand, so you can enjoy watching it unfold instead of thinking \\"What's he saying? Why's she doing that?\\"<br /><br />With that in mind, \\"New Milton Cross' Complete Stories of the Great Operas\\" is an excellent resource for anyone checking out an opera.  Gillian Cross does the job thoroughly -- not only does she give a detailed, insightful, act-by-act summary of the operas, but also provides a listing of the characters, the vocal types that should play them, the setting, the time, and a short biography of the composer (Strauss, Mozart, Verdi and many others).<br /><br />The summaries of all these operas, from \\"Aida\\" to Verdi's retelling of \\"Otello,\\" is also rounded by a trio of essays: \\"How to Enjoy An Opera,\\" which might help wary newcomers be more open-minded about operas as a whole, \\"A Brief History of Opera,\\" and \\"The Ballet of Opera.\\" Not to mention an extensive reading guide for more information on the subject.<br /><br />Most operas are more like Shakespeare than a modern movie -- to many average viewers, they seem almost incomprehensible if the plot isn't clear beforehand. But this book does an excellent job of bringing across the plot -- and many of the nuances -- of each opera without seeming dry or dull.<br /><br />In fact, it's a pretty fun read.

It's a good idea, just not executed well.<br /><br />Alexis Lopez is a slightly overweight talent agent, with a nasty \\"gangsta\\" boyfriend and a longing to break Meximericans into the spotlight. She finds her possible breakout star in Marcella Gauthier Bosch, a stunning rich wild child who wants to be a serious actress, but keeps getting offered roles as \\"maids\\" and \\"crack whores.\\"<br /><br />As Alexis struggles to find Marcella an outstanding role with no jiggle, she encounters Olivia. Olivia is a dowdy, traumatized young mom, with a crumbling marriage. But she's also written the brilliant \\"Soledad,\\" a screenplay that chronicles her mother's life -- the perfect vehicle for Marcella. All three women struggle to bring \\"Soledad\\" to the screen, and struggle just as hard to deal with their delicate relationships with men...<br /><br />At first glance, this sounds like a feisty romp, with three very different Latinas plotting to challenge the behemoth that is Hollywood. It's a cool idea, and one ripe to be explored. Unfortunately, Valdes-Rodriguez doesn't give it everything it needs to really bloom. There's too much book here for too little plot -- it putters out about halfway through the book, and just sort of limps to a finale.<br /><br />This is probably the only book I've ever read where the women think about sex about fifty times more often than the men. In fact, at times it seems to be all the women think about -- even the joyless Olivia checks out porn. If Valdes-Rodriguez wants to portray Hispanic women in a uncliched light, she might want to avoid that. Her writing is solid enough, with looks at the different lifestyles and social positions of L.A., with a look at how hard it is to get a stereotype-free role in Hollywood if you aren't a blonde Caucasian.<br /><br />While Valdes-Rodriguez succeeds in making three radically different women, only one of them is really likable. Olivia is as faded as her sneakers -- she doesn't register a single emotion you can identify with. Marcella is a little too insistently wild and decadent, not to mention bitter. The ultra-nice Alexis is much more likable, with her seemingly hopeless love for a sexy Cuban rapper and body image problems.<br /><br />Valdes-Rodriguez had a good idea, just not the characters and plot to flesh it out. \\"Playing with Boys\\" is a dullish, overstretched slice of chick-lit, without much to make it come to life.if you aren't a blonde Caucasian. <br /> <br />While Valdes-Rodriguez succeeds in making three radically different women, only one of them is really likable.

But Dave Eggers does provide a solid punch to the guy in his memoirs, starting off with \\"Rules and Suggestions for Enjoyment of This Book\\" -- and then the actual story of his life begins. It's clever and poignant, but never dull.<br /><br />Dave Eggers was only 22 years old when both his mother and father died within six months of each other, both of cancer. Suddenly he finds himself the sole guardian of his little brother, and decides to move to Berkley to raise Toph nearer his sister. The two guys live in poverty and chaos, without the usual family structure to rein them in.<br /><br />Tangled up in his emotions, Dave devotes his energy into making a magazine, \\"Might,\\" a cross-cultural magazine that descends into shock and rage. What follows is a hilarious and heartbreaking look at Dave's struggles to care for his brother, work assorted jobs, and sink into Gen-X-based satire and philosophy.<br /><br />Don't hate him just because he's clever. And Eggers is quite clever, in a pleasantly self-deprecating way. But don't be deceived by his flippant anecdotes -- lurking just underneath the irony is a core of sincerity. Parts of it have been \\"fictionalized,\\" but it's hard to tell what Eggers may have made up, and what he actually experienced.<br /><br />It starts off on a dark note with the death of Eggers' mother, which you won't be able to skip over. It's morbidly fascinating, like watching a train crash in slow motion. It's almost too painful to keep your eyes on. After that, however, Eggers kicks into gear. He gives serious scenarios a tongue-in-cheek twist, without making them seem less serious.<br /><br />Though a lot of authors just sound indulgent when they get introspective, Eggers doesn't. He explores his feelings of sorrow, love, resentment, fears of his death, his thoughts on his parents and his own stunted emotions. Toph seems to be the rock that keeps him from being swept away, and the scene where the two brothers play with a frisbee is both sweet and haunting.<br /><br />Eggers has a stream-of-consciousness writing style, with lines like \\"We inherited each other and, we felt, a responsibility to reinvent everything, to scoff and re-create and drive fast while singing loudly and pounding the windows.\\" It's a bit like oral storytelling, as if you were sitting in the room with Eggers and listening to him. At first glance it looks sloppy. But on the second or third, it starts to feel... natural.<br /><br />\\"A Staggering Work of Heartbreaking Genius\\"... sorry, \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\" is a unique memoir by a guy who lived a lot in a short time.

Laurell K. Hamilton stumbles further into the depths of Hades with \\"Incubus Dreams,\\" a dreary erotic horror-fantasy thriller... or is it, thrilling horror-fantasy erotica? Probably the latter -- the most colorful thing about it is Hamilton's insistently graphic sex scenes. Squeezed between the bouts of sex is a tepid little plot, which seems to be suffocating under pressure.<br /><br />Anita Blake's life hasn't been the same since she acquired the \\"ardeur,\\" which basically requires her to have sex constantly. Now she's coming to terms with the fact that she has a male harem, and quite an assortment of new powers. However, her old job still exists -- strippers are being mysteriously drained of blood.<br /><br />To make things worse, the St. Louis police department is getting suspicious of Anita's increasingly supernatural connections -- she's getting too chummy with the werecreatures and vampires. So (between random sex scenes), Anita calls on help to find whoever has murdered the strippers.<br /><br />There's a lot of sex in this book. A LOT of sex. So much that the actual plotline can be covered in a mere twenty minutes, if you skip the sex. In fact, Hamilton's strippers-being-sucked-dry plot seems almost like it was hastily tacked between assorted sex scenes. What's worse, the tantalizing plot hints at the end of \\"Cerulean Sins\\" are left dangling.<br /><br />A few flickers of Hamilton's wit do show through, given Jean-Claude's acid comment about Anita having \\"accidental\\" sex. The pace is slower, and Hamilton seems to be cluing in a little on some of the things that made her past two books so unsatisfying. Unfortunately, she hasn't caught on that her graphic, weirdly un-erotic sex scenes add nothing to the book. The consummation of the triumvirate (yes, consummation) is enough to make you cringe.<br /><br />Anita is obviously having an identity crisis -- it's like Hamilton is trying to meld different personalities together. The result? A very weird lead character who spends most of her time being crabby and whiny. Fans of werewolf Richard may be pleased, since Hamilton seems to have lost her disgust for him, but Jean Claude spends too much time clucking. And Micah? A laughable excuse for a love interest. Who needs a personality when you can have gonads?<br /><br />Hamilton's latest is an improvement over the ghastly \\"Cerulean Sins,\\" but it feels as if she wants to have her cake and eat it too -- change the Blake series to erotica, yet retain her old \\"feel.\\" And certainly this time around, it isn't working.racter who spends most of her time being crabby and whiny.

The central idea is a good one and the murderer chilling, but the supporting cast is too monotonous and cranky.<br /><br />Jean Sheridan returns to Stonecroft Academy for her twentieth high-school reunion, and isn't just haunted by unpleasant teenage memories. She's also haunted by mysterious letters that threaten Lily, the daughter she gave up for adoption when she was only eighteen. And those letters may be linked to a secret killer who is among the students at Stonecroft -- a guy who seethes with old anger, and calls himself \\"The Owl.\\"<br /><br />In the past twenty years, five women from the same class have died in various \\"accidents\\" -- and over the reunion, the class beauty vanishes. One of the men in the old class is a serial killer, but is it the TV magnate, the comedian, the shrink, or the bitter playwright? All were outcasts in high school, and all still resent how they were treated. Jean has to unravel the crime, before she and her daughter become the next victims...<br /><br />When a writer has published almost thirty bestselling mysteries, there really isn't much more that can be said about her. Clark returns to her old form here, favoring a storyline in which an imperiled, intelligent heroine unravels the mystery of the psycho killer. She's done it many times, and if no longer fresh, at least it's still entertaining.<br /><br />Clark's writing is not exceptional, but it's pleasant and easy to read. Except for some editing errors that a capable editor should have caught, she has a good flow that carries you away in the suspense. Sure, you know that Jean is being targeted, but the suspense is even stronger because of that. And including her teenage daughter adds a bit of extra jeopardy.<br /><br />The biggest flaw is the characterization. Jean is a solid lead -- like most of Clark's heroines, she's successful, assured, and quite courageous. Laura, a failing actress and ex-class beauty, is also given some dimension. But the male supporting characters are all successful, seething and resentful, apparently so they fit the profile of The Owl. But it also makes them rather uniform.... not to mention hard to tell apart. The exception is tired cop Sam Coogan, who is a welcome relief.<br /><br />Mary Higgins Clark's \\"Nighttime is My Time\\" is a pleasant suspense novel, if flawed by some bad characterizations.

Well, they do in \\"The Unthinkable Thoughts of Jacob Green,\\" a quirky coming-of-age story in 1970s New Jersey. Like his equally talented brother Zach (director/star/writer of \\"Garden State\\"), Joshua Braff shines in his heart-tugging, funny first novel.<br /><br />Jacob Green dreams of an ideal Jewish family, but unfortunately he's got a wildly dysfunctional one instead. His father Abram is an ideal host and father to the world -- but in his home he's an emotionally abusive perfectionist. Since Jacob has a learning disability, he gets the brunt of his father's wrath. Abram calls him an \\"idiot\\" and \\"retard,\\" even though Jacob is clearly a bright young boy.<br /><br />His father's irrational rages cause Jacob to withdraw into his own imagination, especially since his worn-out mother Claire has fallen in love with her professor. His \\"unthinkable thoughts\\" center on his school, his religion, and his lust for the nanny. And it's only through his fantasies on \\"the unthinkable\\" that he can deal with his disintegrating family life.<br /><br />Family relationships are complex enough when the family is what passes for normal. If they're strange -- forget it. Remember what Tolstoy said: \\"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\\" It's a credit to Braff that he can make what seems like a very depressing novel so incredibly funny. And were it not for the endearing Jacob and his quirky fantasies, it probably would be very depressing.<br /><br />Braff has an irreverent, quick kind of prose, with a mixture of darker problems and full-blown comedy (such as Jacob's brother drawing a picture of a rabbi in a threesome with a pig and lobster). The balance between darkness and humor is just perfect. And he makes no apologies for his politically incorrect jokes -- which makes them even more hilarious.<br /><br />Jacob himself is a lovable character, eager to please and with a sort of naughty innocence. His fantasies are reflections what he wants to do, and that makes them even more poignant. Abram is both amusing and disturbing, given his tendency to blow up about trivialities. Supporting characters like brother Asher and Claire are pretty interesting as well, but the book belongs to Jacob.<br /><br />\\"The Unthinkable Thoughts of Jacob Green\\" is hysterical and heartbreaking, a look at a crumbling family and the unique young boy in the middle of it.

Typos and all. (\\"Early Greeks would not think of foistering so many on the Reading Publick by Authors who's viewpoints have become warped through being overly informed on their own subjeck\\") Not to mention a highly entertaining tale about Lorelei and Dorothy dealing with a crooked literary agent.<br /><br />But Loos also handles her OWN life, and her nonfiction anecdotes show that unlike Lorelei, she had plenty of brains. She describes the events that led to her writing \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,\\" how it was turned into a musical, thoughts on money, Jean Harlow, Colette, the status of blondes and how Communism affected them, and her observations about Hollywood.<br /><br />The parts about Lorelei are fun until you read the various columns that Loos wrote over the course of her life -- then they seem somehow pale in comparison to the writer herself. Loos is dryly witty without being mean-spirited, and has a fun observation on almost anything.<br /><br />Loos lived to be ninety-three, and wrote for most of that time. And her columns stretch from the 1920s into the 1980s -- including thoughts on the sexual revolution (\\"Sex, which has been acclaimed by too many misguided poets as a utopian activity, seldom attains that status in the human race\\"). While Loos changed some of her subjects, her writing still feels rooted in glamour, flappers and martinis.<br /><br />The stories about Lorelei pall when you read Loos's columns. Funny, insightful and huge fun to read, this is perhaps even better than Loos's better-known novels.vels.	2004-09-26

Instead, the first book of the Hel's Crucible duology, \\"Into the Forge,\\" focuses on people as far away from the actual war as possible. Paper thin, poorly characterized, this is a mind-numbingly slow journey with a pair of little twits.<br /><br />The book opens in a small village (mostly populated by Men), where the Warrow Tipperton Thistledown is woken by weird noises in the middle of the night. It turns out to be a Man, fighting Rucks and who ends up being killed by them. Before he dies, he gives Tip a little coin on a thong and tells him to go east, give the coin to \\"Agron,\\" and \\"warn all.\\"<br /><br />So, for reasons not entirely clear to them, Tip and Warrow healer Beau Darby set out through the Drearwood. They have to get to this guy Agron and give him the little coin. They hang around with Elves for a very long time before actually getting moving; in the meantime, the sinister Sauron-clone Modru is trying to take Mithgar over...<br /><br />It's not much of a plot description, because there isn't much of a plot -- this duology might have worked better as a single work. It opens strongly, with some action and suspense, but as soon as Tip and Beau meet up with the Elves, the action stops dead. Apparently the weather is so rotten that they can't keep travelling, so they're forced to hang around and talk for hours with the interchangeable Elf lords. (Every Elf is a lord or a lady -- is any Elf NOT of the nobility?)<br /><br />The only sense of urgency that McKiernan can summon up is the need to finish the book. Readers are told how horrible it would be if Modru conquered the world -- then are treated to pages of the Warrows and Elves ambling around, waiting for the weather to improve. The dialogue is absurd -- what half-asleep person thinks \\"distant metal striking metal\\"? What's with all the medieval English? And how many times can Beau say \\"oh my\\" before someone strangles him?<br /><br />McKiernan's writing is not much better, full of odd old words like \\"siss\\" and \\"whelm.\\" It's trite, flowery and overblown. And McKiernan throws in some obligatory romance for half the characters, usually involving lots of googly eyes, soulmates, and \\"making sweet, gentle love\\" several times. Yick. There's even an Elf pervert, who keeps talking about seeing  Tip naked.<br /><br />Tip is annoying and immature; it's hard to imagine entrusting a shopping list to this little idiot, let alone a fate-of-the-world mission. Beau is a little more memorable, but he also responds to any crisis by saying, \\"Oh my.\\" You can guess how annoying it gets. Phais and Loric are dull, generic Elves. Warrow girl Rynna is apparently supposed to be spunky, but ends up being irritating -- what's even stranger is that Tip finds true love with her, merely because she's the first girl of his own kind that he's met.<br /><br />\\"Into the Forge\\" is one of the worst fantasy books in publication -- a slow, lumbering, brain-dead behemoth of a story.

But his life is suddenly thrown into disarray when an evil Nightmare drives the Bard mad, and a band of berserkers captures Jack and his little sister Lucy. Now Jack is at the questionable mercy of Olaf One-Brow, who fortunately is pleased to have captured a skald (bard).<br /><br />But things go wrong again as soon as they arrive at Olaf's home. The sullen shield-maiden Thorgil gives Lucy as a present to the half-troll queen Frith, who is initially pleased by the pretty little girl. But then Jack accidently says a spell that reveals the queen's true appearance (and it's not a pretty sight). Now the queen threatens to kill Lucy unless Jack goes to the legendary Mimir's well, and finds a way to reverse the spell. But Mimir's well lies in the middle of Jotunheim, a hideous wasteland full of trolls, dragons, carnivore plants and enormous beasts.<br /><br />It's hard to find a fantasy as textured as this one is. Farmer weaves history (Viking berserkers and the destruction of the Holy Isle) with legends (Jotunheim, trolls, Norse gods and Yggdrasil), and never makes you suspend your belief that it could have been like this. Plus there's a bit of Irish druidry, all wrapped up in the growing friendship between the Bard and Jack. The book is worth reading alone for the Bard's insights into nature and happiness.<br /><br />But unlike many less talented writers, Farmer doesn't make everything simple. The berserkers slaughter or enslave whole villages, yet they can be kind and honorable as well. Same with the trolls. And wrapped up in her grim tale of pillage and slavery, Farmer works in some humor as well. \\"Just say no to pillaging\\"? Priceless.<br /><br />Jack evolves wonderfully over the book, turning from an ordinary farm boy into a sensitive, intelligent bard. Thorgil takes a rather long time to become sympathetic, although Farmer creates a realistic background to explain why she's such a pill.<br /><br />Nancy Farmer creates another classic in \\"Sea of Trolls,\\" a magical blend of history and myth.

Certainly it's far above the average short story collection.<br /><br />In eight different parts of the world, eight different stories are unfolding on ht evening of March 19, 1929. A young Danish mathematician learns more about the conquest of Africa, when he finds himself on a train with Joseph Conrad and General von Lettow-Vorbeck. A ballet dancer loves and learns about reality. A judge finds himself falling madly in love with a man he's just jailed... for homosexual behavior. A small town is swept by a smallpox epidemic. And through these dark stories run a flurry of artists, students, scientists, Nazis and lovers.<br /><br />Peter Hoeg is a writer for people who like their books deep and intense. There isn't a light or fluffy moment in the whole book. In a way, \\"Tales of the Night\\" is all about love. We see love in all its different forms -- pain, learning, redemption and fear. While it isn't obvious at first, the depths of Hoeg's writing becomes clearer on the second or third time around.<br /><br />Hoeg's writing is beautiful -- very thick and slow, and almost dreamlike. It's not something to be read quickly. He weaves in a lot of symbolism and philosophy, without making them \\"message stories.\\" And at the same time, since the book is set in 1929, he includes some of the political rumblings that came before war.<br /><br />The characters of Hoeg's stories are all loners. Whether they're travellers, lovers, or artists, they all seem to be enclosed in little private bubbles. Not to mention a bit repressed and wrapped up in their own thoughts. Some of them are the sort of people you would despise in real life, but he gives them a sense of humanity and depth.<br /><br />Peter Hoeg was still a newbie writer when he penned \\"Tales of the Night,\\" but his writing already had polish and depth.

Kate Christensen cooks up a morbidly funny story in \\"An Epicure's Lament,\\" full of food and dysfuction with a dash of very twisted sentimentality. Sprinkle with cynicism, and let simmer.<br /><br />Upper-crust, middle-aged Hugo was once a gigolo and an aspiring writer, but now he spends his days in a decayed mansion, cooking and reading essays by Michel de Montaigne, and occasionally having flings with young women. He has Buerger's disease, which is not fatal unless he smokes -- so he smokes a lot. But his life is turned upside down when his brother Dennis arrives, in the throes of a divorce.<br /><br />Worse yet, Hugo's estranged wife Sonia is coming to stay with him, along with her daughter Bellatrix, who was born when they were together -- but isn't his daughter. Hugo is not too pleased by this, but he starts to like his not-daughter Bellatrix. Called on to create a Christmas feast for his fractured, dysfunctional family, ex-paramours and a former hit man, Hugo learns a bit about himself as he prepares for suicide.<br /><br />No, it doesn't sound like a funny book. And it isn't. Not in a slapsticky, goofy way, anyway. Instead it's the morbid, deadpan humor that wins us over, wrapped up in Hugo's wonderfully self-centered thoughts. \\"Lately I'm finding myself increasingly embedded in other people's lives, which nauseates me and fills me with fear,\\" he muses at one point.<br /><br />But though I doubt he'd admit it, Hugo changes over the course of the book -- he gets a bit softer and more accepting. He still ponders rough sex, food, homicide, hypocrisy and writing -- yet he tries to deal with a local pedophile, and forms a bond with Bellatrix. In a way he's like J.D. Salinger's immortal Holden, cynical yet with a little softness under all the crust.<br /><br />The supporting characters really do seem like real people -- some of them wear their hearts on their sleeves (au pair Louisa), and some are strange even to Hugo (Sonia, sometime lover Stephanie). And on the male side, gay Uncle Tommy provides some gossipy fun, while Dennis is a dull, stagnant devoted dad -- the opposite of Hugo.<br /><br />\\"An Epicure's Lament\\" is an unexpectedly funny, bitter, bizarre book, with a cast odder than the Addams family.

But in the 21st-century age of equality, women can be just as phobic as men. And that's the core of \\"Being Committed,\\" a frothy and amusing tale about women who fear getting in too deep.<br /><br />Hannah Lovekin has no desire to get married -- she had a brief union with Jack when she was twenty, and it lasted less than six months. Now she's ten years older and wiser, and has a wonderful, adoring boyfriend. Then Jason asks Hannah to marry him, and she turns the poor guy down. Ba-dum -- she decides she does want him after all, when he falls into the arms of a different woman.<br /><br />Jason still wants her too, but he wants her to deal with her inner demons first -- and that means dealing with Jack. So Hannah contacts her ex-husband, who is still nursing wounds of his own, and begins to struggle through her own hangups. But things get even more complex when Hannah begins to get confused over what man she actually wants....<br /><br />Maxted has a disarming tendency to tackle not-so-frothy topics in a frothy way. In this case, it's how your family, friends and relationships shape how you feel and think. While the ending is obvious to anyone who has read even a few chick-lit books, it's the twisting ride to the finale that counts.<br /><br />Maxted has a pleasantly breezy way of writing, and she does a good job of digging into Hannah's soul. And it's engaging to see Hannah examining her relationships with her parents, her brother and his wife, and her ex-husband. The psychoanalysis-on-top-of-froth makes the narrative a little top-heavy at times, although Maxted does balance it out well overall.<br /><br />Hannah would be an easy character to mess up -- with her hangups and repressed fears, she could easily have been annoying and pathetic. Instead, she comes across as a bit messed up, but a likable, self-deprecating woman. Jack and Jason both come across as three-dimensional and pleasant, although some of the secondary characters (the parents) are lacking.<br /><br />Maxted's fourth novel is a pleasant chick-lit diversion, with a dose of psychoanalysis and family angst. A nice light read with a few heavy chapters.ss as three-dimensional and pleasant, although some of the secondary characters (the parents) are lacking. <br /> <br />Maxted's fourth novel is a pleasant chick-lit diversion, with a dose of psychoanalysis and family angst.

Wodehouse was one of the funniest people of the twentieth century, with his goofy peers, superbrained butlers and absurd stories. David A. Jasen clearly has done his research, but \\"P.G. Wodehouse: A Portrait of a Master\\" is merely a passable biography, not a great one.<br /><br />Pelham Grenville Wodehouse was born to an upper-class British family living in Hong Kong, although he himself was born on English soil. He and two of his siblings also went to school in England, in the care of aunts and uncles, while his parents remained on the other side of the world.<br /><br />Writing was clearly in \\"Plum's\\" blood from an early age -- he wrote his first story at the age of seven. Later he gained attention for penning school stories, but he gained fame as a result of his humorous looks at the British upper-classes, most notably the dim aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his quiet, ultra-intelligent manservant Jeeves.<br /><br />Any biography of Wodehouse would have to be a positive one, since he seems to have led a pretty upright life. The most scandalous thing that seems to have happened to him was being accused of being a Nazi sympathizer. And that was mainly naivete. In his everyday life, Wodehouse comes across as a nice, funny guy who was immersed in his own stories.<br /><br />Despite his efforts to stay objective, Jasen comes across as a scholarly fan. He mentions just about every positive mention of Wodehouse (including from Dorothy Parker). And despite calling Wodehouse by his nickname -- \\"Plum\\" -- he remains respectful of Wodehouse's personal life, his marriage to Ethel, and his relationships with family and friends.<br /><br />Unfortunately while Jasen is a good fan, he's not such a good writer. Well, he's not a bad one. But \\"Portrait of a Master\\" is very dry and sometimes even a bit desiccated. It's basically a chronological look at the events in Wodehouse's life, without much to bring them to life. And it's almost impossible to keep Wodehouse's dozens of short stories and novels straight.<br /><br />Despite the uninspired writing, this is a good resource for P.G. Wodehouse fans. \\"P.G.

Now with the series rounded out to six books, \\"Tehanu\\" has proved itself to be the black sheep of the family -- it's well written, but preachy and lacking in Le Guin's magical touch.<br /><br />Tenar was once a powerful priestess in a darkened kingdom, until the wizard Ged rescued her and brought her away with him. Now Tenar is a widow, after marrying into an ordinary village and living an ordinary life. She's lonely, but takes care of the burned Therru, a silent young girl who was abused by her parents. Suddenly a dragon arrives, with a wounded Ged on its back -- he's lost his powers in saving Earthsea.<br /><br />Tenar helps nurse her old friend back to health, and Ged struggles to come to terms with the loss of his magic, which is something he's always had. Their relationship begins to grow deeper and tenderer. But a new threat rears its head, and it may not be Ged or Tenar -- but Therru -- who is called on to stop it.<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Tehanu\\" is that it really has no story. Each of the previous books had a clearly defined storyline, but in this book, it's basically just Tenar pottering around, Ged moping, and Therru not doing much at all. At the end, the narrative develops some vitality and mystery. Up until then, there is no epic power, no awe-inspiring quality.<br /><br />Certainly there's nothing wrong with a smaller, more intimate story. Nor is there a problem with the feministic slant of the book. However, without the spellbinding quality of the first three books, there really isn't much to hold your attention. Le Guin's writing is still beautiful and poetic, yet it somehow feels empty -- she let the message about women take over the narrative, rather than weaving it in.<br /><br />While it's somehow disappointing to find that Tenar simply became a housewife, it's interesting to see her internal conflicts, her regrets, and her growing love for Ged. Ged is less engaging, since he has lost his powers and mainly thinks about that. And most of the supporting characters -- except the dragon -- are dull and two-dimensional. Please, enough with the 2-D misogynists.

Dunkle has a wonderful flair for storytelling -- she gives you suspense, creeps, humor and romance, all entwined in a wonderfully surreal storyline.<br /><br />Kate and Emily are recent orphans, sent to the estate of Hallow Hill to live with their sour-faced guardian Hugh. Soon after they arrive, the girls become lost in the woods -- and encounter goblins posing as gypsies. Kate finds that she is being singled out by the goblin king Marak to be his bride. The goblin kings always kidnap human girls to be their wives, and since Marak's mad wife has died, he wants a new queen to produce an heir for him.<br /><br />At first, Kate resists Marak as he tries to kidnap her. But Hugh tricks Kate into walking down into Marak's realm and surrendering herself to be his wife, and Emily comes with her. At first Kate is miserable and homesick, since she is destined to remain underground for the rest of her life. But the goblins are falling prey to evil sorcery, which binds them in sleep, and threatens the whole hollow kingdom...<br /><br />\\"Hollow Kingdom\\" is pretty much everything a fantasy should be -- fantastical, well-plotted, and with a well-created alternate world. Not to mention the goblins themselves. Dunkle has obviously thought out a lot of detailed history about elves, dwarves, and goblins, while carefully linking them with old legends. And she actually makes it halfway plausible.<br /><br />Dunkle has a good writing style, polished, quick and full of details. Even long conversations about the history of goblins are kept interesting. Whether it's a goblin chase on a dark night or a sunrise seen through a lake, she makes it come alive. And despite the grimness of the storyline, Dunkle keeps plenty of humor in the dialogue. (\\"You're just like that other King!\\" \\"No. I'm not green.\\")<br /><br />Kate is an excellent heroine, with plenty of spirit and determination. Even though she starts off fearing Marak, she gradually comes to appreciate and love him. And Marak is an interesting combination of truthfulness and charm, as interesting as Kate. Supporting characters like elf-cat Seylin and Kate's sister Emily are also well-drawn.<br /><br />\\"Hollow Kingdom\\" is a truly excellent fantasy, casting a new light on things that go bump in the night.

While Sue herself can come across as naive and sometimes unlikable, her raw emotions and confusion make this feel a bit like a real-life Chinese \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\"<br /><br />She is a disaffected fifteen-year-old, from a middle-class family in Beijing. Loves punk-rock bands, writes poetry, longs to drop out of school, and struggles with her own feelings of nihilistic despair and pessimism. Soon after the book opens, she loses her virginity to Li Qi, only to find that he has a girlfriend and doesn't love her.<br /><br />She immerses herself in the rock scene again, and gets involved with a rising indie-rock god/poet, then a Finnish tourist, while going to a shrink, getting magazine jobs and dropping in and out of school -- a merry-go-round of sex, rock, love, and a neverending search for a vague freedom.<br /><br />\\"Beijing Doll\\" was famously banned in China. And it's not surprising -- this isn't exactly a complimentary look at Chinese youth. Chun Sue's story isn't too different from that of many other disaffected teens, but she does bring a lot of unbridled dark energy to it. Her alter ego is a girl who has seen enough to be jaded, but is naive enough to still not know quite how it all works.<br /><br />Her writing is spare and sharp, with the occasional lapses into poetry. At times the story can get a bit monotonous -- the parade of brief boyfriends tend to blur together, as do Sue's semi-suicidal fantasies. And many older readers will find her angst and complaints annoying. However, Chun Sue does do a good job of capturing the confusion, the contradictions, and the depression of being a teenager.<br /><br />Chun Sue's alter ego, Jiafu, only grows much at the end; readers might be annoyed with her repeated lapses into relationships with men who use her or have serious issues. However, those who remember the darker moments of teenagerhood will probably identify with her struggles. Maybe not with the vast number of boyfriends, or the pessimism about finding happiness. But the confusion on the inside is striking.<br /><br />A unique coming-of-age tale, \\"Beijing Doll\\" is a peculiar roman a clef, with a mixture of the annoying and the sublime.

When people think of wizards, they think of gray-bearded old men with pointy hats and staffs. But nothing could be further from Diana Wynne-Jones' Chrestomanci, a dapper English mage with nine lives and the responsibility of overseeing magic in ALL the worlds. \\"The Chronicles of Chrestomanci, Volume 2\\" compiles two of the books about this unique mage, \\"Witch Week\\" and \\"Magicians of Caprona\\".<br /><br />\\"Witch Week\\" takes place in England, at a school called Larwood House that is reminiscent of English boarding schools in such books as Harry Potter -- but suspicion seethes in this one. In this world, witches are burned at the stake. And someone is a witch -- but who is it? Unpopular Nan? Silent Indian boy Nirupam? The identity of the witch (or witches) may change the world...<br /><br />\\"The Magicians of Caprona\\" takes place in Italy, in the city of Caprona. Casa Montana and Casa Petrocchi are two Italian families of spellmakers, who have been feuding for a long time over an insult that neither family can really remember. But unknown to them, war and an evil enchanter are endangering Caprona. It falls to magically inept Tonini Montana and Angelina Petrocchi to save the day...<br /><br />Long before there was Harry Potter, Diana Wynne-Jones was penning the funny, imaginative tales about Chrestomanci. \\"Magicians of Caprona\\" and \\"Witch Week\\" pretty much break the mold for fantasy wizards, choosing to be humorous and inventive instead of melodramatic and cheesy.<br /><br />Don't expect fluffy fantasy. Jones's prose is amusing, dramatic, evocative and fast-paced. The intricate magical systems, where a single event can send an entire universe awry, are wonderfully portrayed and dramatically brought to our attention. And despite the Italian setting of \\"Caprona,\\" the two books have a crisp, British flavor.<br /><br />Her characters are likable ones. In \\"Caprona,\\" there's a bit of goofiness in the generations-long feud. But the characters themselves are much like real people. And \\"Witch Week\\" captures, without a sense of cozy romance, the trials of being at a school where you're the unpopular kid -- there's a clique of popular students, and a larger number of unhappy, lonely ones.<br /><br />Forget the antics of Harry Potter, and step into the magical stories of of Chrestomanci and his magical worlds. \\"The Chronicles of Chrestomanci, Volume 2\\" is a must-read for fantasy fans.al people.

Kara Dalkey crafts a poignant, suspenseful fantasy, with plenty of Japanese folklore and a dash of romance. It keeps going at a fast clip and is written wonderfully, although it feels somehow unfinished. (Since there's a sequel, don't worry about it)<br /><br />Mitsuko is a shy young girl in the Court, overshadowed by her older sisters, especially the newly-married Amaiko. But when warrior monks threaten her family, her father sends them off to a country estate -- except that the monks attack, and kill Amaiko's husband Yugiri. Amaiko, lost in grief, seems to fall into a coma -- her soul is gone to look for her dead husband.<br /><br />After her family is captured, Mitsuko embarks on a desperate journey to find Yugiri, so that Amaiko can get on with her life. She ends up with an unusual helper -- a tengu (birdlike demon) named Goranu. He takes her to meet gods and devils, down into the depths of the netherworld. But can Mitsuko find Yugiri and rescue her family as well?<br /><br />Ah, if only other historical fantasies were as pretty and rich as this one is. Dalkey clearly has a handle on her Buddhist and Shinto folklore, as well as her historical knowledge of politics and customs. And she makes it all an integral part of a touching, intense plot.<br /><br />Dalkey's writing is spare and vaguely formal, but she gives plenty of detail to the supernatural scenes. And the intricate plot is a convincing one, with Mitsuko struggling to do all sorts of things to rescue her family, and lay Yugiri's ghost to rest. The only downside is that while the ending wraps up most of the loose ends, it feels like it's leading to the next book.<br /><br />Mitsuko is an excellent heroine. She starts off timid, but her courage and strength start growing through the course of the novel. And Goranu is a real winner -- he's a trickster with an acid tongue, but he's actually very kind and eventually loving to Mitsuko.<br /><br />\\"Little Sister\\" is a beautiful little historical fantasy, with plenty of action, romance, and a sweet little romance woven in.

Wodehouse was only embarking on his long, prestigious literary career when he wrote \\"The Swoop! Or, How Clarence Saved England.\\" It's a very brief novel, lacking in Wodehouse's usual complexity, but it's still a quirky little read.<br /><br />A faithful Boy Scout, Clarence is one of those kids who worries a lot about their country -- almost too much. He belongs to a pleasantly staid family who think he's a little nuts, because of his constant moans about how England has deteriorated. But it seems that he might be at least partly right when German prince invades during tea.<br /><br />Nine other hostile armies invade England, much to the indignation of the populace. Unfortunately, the English don't put up much of a resistance, since \\"the Socialists had condemned the army system as unsocial.\\" And suddenly Clarence and the Boy Scouts are the thing standing between Endland and total occupation.<br /><br />\\"At last I begin to realise the horrors of an invasion -- for the invaders.\\" Wodehouse wrote this amusing little book before World War II -- during that war, the idea of Germans invading wouldn't have been as funny. But the ideas are still quite amusing: of a smallish invasion force being politely but firmly ejected from an Essex house, because they interrupted teatime.<br /><br />Plotwise, it's not very complex. In fact, compared to his usual tangles of love, blackmail and stolen policemen's helmets, it's simple. But it is amusing, the idea of a bunch of Boy Scouts overthrowing nine different invading forces. Wodehouse's entertaining dialogue is brilliantly absurd. (\\"An hour ago your camp was silently surrounded by patrols of Boy Scouts, armed with catapults and hockey-sticks\\").<br /><br />\\"The Swoop! Or How Clarence Saved England\\" is a fun little novel by a master humorist, who was just starting to find his niche when he wrote it. It's not the best that P.G.

Was McKiernan's first-written book, \\"Trek to Kraggen-Cor,\\" better than the ones published before it? In a word, no. It's still a poor clone of J.R.R. Tolkien's masterful works, full of weird writing and annoying characters.<br /><br />Perry is the descendent of the great Tuckerby Underbank, living in the Boskydells. As a rather nerdy scholar, he dreams of battles and adventures -- and his fantasies come true when Lord Kian and two Dwarves show up on his doorstep. They need help reclaiming the ancient Dwarf citadel of Kraggen-Cor from the evil Spawn that have invaded, and Perry has memorized the old maps and directions.<br /><br />Perry's thrilled, but his handyman Cotton Buckleburr isn't that thrilled. They travel with Kian and the Dwarves, training and learning to fight as they go, and soon meet up with their allies, the Dwarf army and the Vanadurim. But Perry is about to find out that what's ahead is not a glorious battle, but a horrific slaughter...<br /><br />\\"Trek to Kraggen-Cor\\" is the sort of writing generally classified as \\"fanfic\\": stories written by fans of a TV show, movie, or book. McKiernan is clearly a huge fan of \\"Lord of the Rings\\"; how else could he have taken so many details from Tolkien's masterful epic and transplanted them into a similar backdrop? The whole thing stinks of Middle-Earth. Even small details -- such as the little silver horn or the mushrooms -- were written by Tolkien first and best.<br /><br />Very little actually happens in this book; most of it is talking, travelling, or both at once. The travelling is excruciating; McKiernan gives us every dull detail. The dialogue is a little better, but there's too much melodrama (and, in Cotton's case, poorly-written country-Brit dialect). The preoccupation with clothing details, hysterical laughter, and to-be-continued sign on the end make it even more frustrating.<br /><br />Perry is apparently supposed to be a naive yet plucky hero; he merely comes across as a drip who has no contact with reality. Cotton's folksy attitude wears thin, but he's an acceptable character; Kian really isn't very interesting, nor does he seem very bright. He's basically on it for the adventure. The Dwarves are all utterly interchangeable, including Borin and Anval.<br /><br />The first is not always best, and such is true with \\"Trek To Kraggen-Cor.\\" Only if you liked his excruciating \\"Iron Tower\\" trilogy will you like the travesty of Dennis McKiernan's first duology.ntly supposed to be a naive yet plucky hero; he merely comes across as a drip who has no contact with reality.

It's hard to listen to the Smashing Pumpkins, and not be struck by former frontman Billy Corgan's unique writing -- often his songs sounded like poetry set to music. Now he really is a poet. \\"Blinking With Fists,\\" his first book of poetry, is a stunning, wrenching look at Corgan's ever-expanding talents.<br /><br />Corgan was known for plumbing the depths of his own feelings in his songs. Now he does the same for his poetry. His poems are gritty and jagged, but they shine through as examinations of his emotions: his loves, losses, loneliness, past regrets, and sometimes his hopes. He makes you feel thoughtful, isolated, on a dark street where dogs are barking, and the world seems to be winding down.<br /><br />Billy Corgan rose to prominence during the grunge era of Nirvana in the early nineties, as frontman/writer/vocalist of the Smashing Pumpkins. Later, he was the frontman of the sadly short-lived Zwan. But with \\"Blinking With Fists,\\" (and the novel Corgan is reportedly working on), he shows that he's not just a musician. He gets to take the evocative, eerie writing that he did in the Smashing Pumpkins and Zwan, and turn that writing into something purer.<br /><br />What's even better, free-form poetry allows Corgan to be less restricted in his writing. In \\"Blinking,\\" he doesn't have to form his poetry so that it will fit with music. But it still is very lyrical and beautiful, full of strange images and melancholy atmosphere. It takes a little while to really sink in -- but boy, is it worth it when it does.<br /><br />Billy Corgan has apparently left his band days behind him. But his debut publication, \\"Blinking With Fists,\\" is a breathtaking collection of poetry that bodes well for his solo career. Highly recommended.	2004-09-17

Now Cotton helps the dwarves make their way into their ancestral home, hoping to meet Perry and the others in a battle that will decide the fate of Kraggen-Cor.<br /><br />Inside Kraggen-Cor, Perry, Kian, Silverleaf and many others are trying to figure out how to defeat the evil creatures inside. To find their way through, they follow the path through the hundreds of tunnels, which Perry has memorized. But they find themselves first trapped in the hideous Ghath's abandoned cage -- and then enmeshed in a battle they can't possibly win. Unless, of course, Perry unravels the riddle of Narok, a silver horn that the dwarves fear...<br /><br />Readers who have respect for J.R.R. Tolkien and the unparalleled integrity of his work will cringe at reading McKiernan's early works. Where the Iron Tower Trilogy was blatantly derivative, this is a blatant attempt at a sequel -- everything from the cave-kingdom of the dwarves to the little silver horn is done in \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" Most people who write this sort of stuff are called fanfiction writers.<br /><br />What makes \\"Brega Path\\" better than \\"Trek to Kraggen-Cor\\"? Frankly, it's the ending. McKiernan's endings are either very happy or very depressing, and it's hard not to be charmed by the finale. And surprisingly, McKiernan's writing smooths out quite a bit. But he does get carried away by the idea of a prophecy (enough with the prophecies! Does he write a single book without one?), and too much repetitive action (enough casting of hoods over faces!). The literally earthshattering climax is spoiled by Perry singing in the background.<br /><br />Perry is still a colossal idiot -- until he actually gets stuck in a bloody, nasty battle, he still doesn't fully clue in that he isn't up to being a warrior. Cotton is pleasant, if you can ignore his ridiculous faux-country-Brit accent. The supporting characters tend to be thin and dull, and the dwarves are completely flat. Expect to get them all mixed up, because they are all the same.<br /><br />\\"The Brega Path\\" has more charm than its predecessor, but it's still deeply flawed, with an unengaging cast and a plot that's drawn out way too long.lossal idiot -- until he actually gets stuck in a bloody, nasty battle, he still doesn't fully clue in that he isn't up to being a warrior.

In \\"Cocktail Time,\\" Wodehouse turns his considerable wit toward politicians, scandalous novels, and of course, the carefree twentysomethings of the British upper-class.<br /><br />Lord Ickenham (also known as Uncle Fred) gets a little \\"loopy\\" when he comes to the city. So when he's at his nephew's favorite hangout, the Drones Club, he fires a brazil nut across the street at a stuffy relative of his, Beefy Bastable. Bastable is not exactly a nice person, and so to retaliate against the young idiot he thinks has attacked him, he writes a scathing, scandalous novel called \\"Cocktail Time,\\" denouncing modern youth.<br /><br />Written under a non de plume, \\"Cocktail Time\\" gets denounced from the pulpits and is a huge hit. Bastable is terrified that the book will derail his political career, so he enlists his nephew Cosmo to pretend to have written the book. Since the royalties will let Cosmo pay off his debts, he's more than happy to oblige. There are only two problems: An American con artist (known as Oily) is homing in on Cosmo, and so is Hollywood...<br /><br />If somebody could write songs about brazil nuts and banned books, this would make a GREAT musical. It's lighthearted enough, goofy enough, and complex enough. Wodehouse is in fine form here, writing the lovable characters that fit into the molds we love so much -- stressed young men, disapproving uncles and stolid butlers.<br /><br />Wodehouse's writing is still fresh and funny -- he has a few awkward moments, such as describing a couple dancing the \\"rock'n'roll.\\" Okay, what does that mean? But whatever decade his novel is set in, it has that pre-WW II flair. Not to mention deceptive formality -- at first glance, it looks very dry, but it's actually very goofy. (\\"Yo ho. In fact, I will go further. Yo frightfully ho.\\")<br /><br />Lord Ickenham is a fun character, very smooth and debonair with a distinctly loopy personality. The impoverished Cosmo and his deeply stressed uncle Beefy Bastable are good variations on Wodehouse's classic characters, and he adds a twist by having the butler fall in love with his employer's sister (an unexpectedly sweet touch).<br /><br />\\"Cocktail Time\\" is a funny novel about a nasty novel, and the resulting hijinks are fun for anyone to read.

Zelazny's story is a bit fractured this time around, but he builds up some important new characters and developments, as exiled prince Corwin tries to get back the throne of Amber.<br /><br />Corwin has escaped the clutches of his usurping brother Eric, and comes to the land of Lorraine (I'm not making this name up). One of his old enemies, Ganelon, is the head honcho of that place, so Corwin has to watch his step. Lorraine is being menaced by an army of evil shadow creatures, lead by a goat-headed being that threatens everyone and everything in that land.<br /><br />Then he travels to Avalon with Ganelon, to meet his brother Benedict, who has no ambition but lots of military skill. Corwin is after \\"jeweler's rouge,\\" which can be used like gunpowder, and Avalon is the place to get it. While he's there, he encounters Benedict's great-granddaughter Dara, and slips into an affair with her -- except that Dara is not what she seems, and the threat to Amber is more than just Eric.<br /><br />Don't even try reading \\"Guns of Avalon\\" unless you've already read \\"Nine Princes in Amber\\" -- the Amber series is like a pair of novels, and each story is divided into five novel-chapters. While the two stories in \\"Guns\\" don't seem to have much in common, they are both vital parts of the ongoing Amber story. But it's a little weird to read them at first, since they seem so disconnected.<br /><br />With new worlds to explore, Zelazny expands his writing -- everything is more detailed and wild in this story, from the unpronounceable demon to the talking cats. But he keeps that spare, sardonic edge to his writing. No matter how much detail he includes, it always feels carefully stripped down. Even the dialogue is simple and to the point.<br /><br />Corwin is a little less engaging in this book, since he's sneaking around rather than openly attacking. Well, the guy was trapped in a dungeon for five years -- it's to be expected. But by the climax, he's back in fighting form. And the supporting characters (from the devious Dara to straightforward Benedict) are impossible to grasp. Good guys turn out to be bad, and vice versa -- everyone has ulterior motives, and is secretly plotting.<br /><br />The Amber series picks up steam in \\"Guns of Avalon.\\" While the two-story plotting is a little disconcerting, the scheming characters and brilliant worldbuilding make this a worthy sequel.n a dungeon for five years -- it's to be expected.

But Mike Davis strays from urban theory here: a young adult science adventure with a few hints of sci-fi. \\"Land of the Lost Mammoths\\" is that rarest kind of kid book -- educational and fun, not to mention as intriguing to adults as to their honor student kid.<br /><br />Four young students win special U.N. scholarships, thanks to their brilliance in biology, engineering, linguistics and ecosystems. They're going to Greenland, to study under celebrated scientist Professor Dansgaard. Jack, his half-brother Conor, Qavigarssuag (\\"Qav\\") and Julia soon find that Dansgaard is indeed brilliant, though rather eccentric.<br /><br />But how eccentric? They find mammoth bones in Dansgaard's office, and learn that he believes that mammoths still exist somewhere nearby. He also believes that the descendents of an ancient Viking colony still live in hiding. The group travels to a legendary valley in a glacier, but things start to go wrong, pitting them against the forces of nature -- and a Viking sorcerer.<br /><br />Perceval Press is best known for publishing spellbinding poetry, photography, music and other art. Here they take a small detour -- it's sort of a modern Jules Verne book for kids. Davis doesn't let the plot lag for a moment, and he's not afraid to sprinkle in stuff to give you thrills and chills. Is all this science and history boring? Heck no.<br /><br />The plot is sprinkled with examinations of ecological and political ramifications. For example, Qav brings up the U.S.'s controversial presence in Greenland at one point. Another would be the conflict between the expedition members -- should they bring a gun into a Viking camp? The question of whether they should risk themselves to avoid contaminating an unspoiled culture is a hard one, and not one that Davis chickens out on.<br /><br />The characters are well-drawn and likable, and Davis successfully makes them seem intelligent and innovative without being annoying. And William Simpson provides delicate, detailed black-and-white illustrations, complete with animal skulls and Celtic knots. It adds to the feeling that the present and past are twined together in this book.<br /><br />\\"Land of the Lost Mammoths\\" is a surprising but very welcome \\"bedtime story\\" from Mike Davis, with enough fun and thrills to send readers scrambling for more research books.ying.

That's the problem Corwin has at the start of Robert Zelazny's \\"Nine Princes in Amber,\\" the tightly-written opener of his ten book Amber series.<br /><br />A man wakes up in a hospital and strong-arms his way out -- he doesn't know who he is or where he came from. But then he finds a woman, Flora, who says she's his sister, and starts to piece together his past -- his name is Corwin, he has several siblings (most of whom he has a not-so-pleasant relationship with). And the word \\"Amber\\" -- it brings something to mind, but he can't quite remember what.<br /><br />Corwin gets a bit of help from his brother Random, after he saves Random from a bunch of Shadow creatures. Their cruel elder brother Eric is crowning himself king of Amber, but all the siblings are catfighting for the throne. Corwin and a few of his allied brothers band together with their armies and navies, determined to stop Eric -- but with disastrous results.<br /><br />The Amber series is more like two long novels than ten short ones, and the big blinking \\"To Be Continued\\" at the end of \\"Nine Princes in Amber\\" is proof enough of that. It doesn't finish the story, but just stops. Even though that's frustrating, it stops in a fairly satisfying place -- there's no cliffhanger, just the question of what Corwin will do next.<br /><br />Zelazny is known for having spare, snappy writing. And he's in peak form in \\"Nine Princes.\\" His descriptions are minimalist, but very vivid (someone's weathered skin is \\"porous as an orange rind\\"), and his dialogue is sharp and to the point. And he has a good handle on his fantasy world, whipping up mind-bending idea like the Pattern, green-haired merwomen, magical Trump cards, strange shadow-horses and vaguely-human beasts.<br /><br />Corwin himself is a sort of action-Bogart character -- very tough, seasoned and cynical, but with a mushy core somewhere in there. Most of the characters aren't explored fully, except the Flora, who isn't very bright, and Random, who wants desperately to prove himself. But with all these schemes and secret motives, they all promise more depth in future.<br /><br />\\"Nine Princes in Amber\\" does just what the start of a series should do -- it draws you in and makes you desperate to know what's ahead. Solid, creative family-feud fantasy.hy core somewhere in there.

Without missing a step, \\"Lirael\\" follows in \\"Sabriel\\"'s footsteps, with the same dark blend of humor and horror.<br /><br />Lirael is a daughter of the Clayr, but she won't be a full Clayr until she gains the Sight. On her fourteenth birthday, she is the oldest girl to not yet have gained the Sight. After contemplating suicide, Lirael is assigned to work in the library, and inadvertantly sets loose a hideous Free Magic creature: a Stilken that will call other Free Magic creatures and destroy the Clayr. Desperate to deal with her mistake, Lirael calls up the Disreputable Dog (somehow made both of Free and Charter Magic) and soon ends up finding out more about her past -- and her future.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Sabriel's son Sameth is pursued by the Dead, and is almost killed in the process; the only thing he gets for his trouble is a threat from a mysterious necromancer. Sam is supposed to be the future Abhorsen, but the problem is that he's petrified by the things his mother handles easily. And he's helped loose Free Magic on a world increasingly torn by a mysterious masked necromancer...<br /><br />Nix takes the rich world he created in \\"Sabriel\\" and makes it even richer. It's a bit like a melding of typical high fantasy with an early twentieth-century setting (phones, buses, cricket matches, electricity, guns). Old faves like Sabriel, Touchstone, and Mogget appear here (although Mogget's appearance is a bit brief), along with new and equally likable characters.<br /><br />Some readers may not like Lirael as well as they liked the more self-assured, kick-butt Sabriel, but Sabriel knew who she was, where she was coming from, and knew what she needed to know. Lirael is only learning those things, which makes her a more vulnerable, confused heroine. She becomes stronger and more self-assured as she learns more about Charter magery and her background.<br /><br />\\"Lirael\\" has the same balance of humor and horror as the first book. We have things like the bodies of refugees being turned into decayed Dead Hands, the clawed insecto-human Stilken, or just the aura of darkness around the Book of the Dead. But we also have funny things like Nick or the running joke about the Dog and food.<br /><br />The Disreputable Dog is a lot like Mogget, in that she's more than she seems and a handy source of info, but not as quietly menacing as Mogget was. And Sam is endearingly unsure of himself, and is one of the few fantasy characters to be genuinely terrified of his \\"duties,\\" not just apprehensive. His sister was the one character who fell flat; she seemed a little too \\"bossy princess.\\"<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Lirael: Daughter of the Clayr\\" is that it ends on a \\"to be continued\\" note.

After elevating the world of chick-lit, Helen Fielding does a 180 from Bridget Jones novels, writing a lighthearted spy novel, \\"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination.\\" Olivia's bumbling gets rather annoying after awhile, but it's an amusing light read.<br /><br />Olivia Joules (original name: Rachel Pixley) was orphaned at a young age, and managed to claw her way into a top-level journalism job. But she's always had a vivid imagination, that results in her constantly reporting swarms of locusts, starving zoos and other things. So when she sees a guy who resembles Osama bin Laden (who turns out to be an international playboy, Pierre Feramo) at a Miami perfume launch, she immediately starts sniffing the trail.<br /><br />The next day, there's a missile attack on a local cruise -- and Olivia has good reason to think that Feramo is involved. Then her hotel room is bugged, and a giant sack of cocaine is left under her clothes. Now Olivia is convinced that Feramo is part of the al Quaeda -- but can she be a successful spy without losing her head, literally?<br /><br />Fans of James Bond and Jason Bourne need not apply -- Fielding's spy novel is a lightweight affair, with a decidedly amateur heroine. If you don't take it too seriously, it's an amusing beach-read. But if you take your spy-lit very seriously, you'll loathe every last word of it.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest stumbling block is the idea of writing a chick-lit thriller about al Qaeda, a very real and sinister organization. I can understand Fielding's desire to laugh at what we fear, but it feels weird to have something so very unfunny as the center of her novel. Certainly it's well-written, and Fielding mixes in some elements to keep it from being too fluffy -- including an M16 agent, poisons, drugs and a decapitation.<br /><br />Most of the supporting characters are enigmatic and sinister enough to be convincing spy-lit characters. The exceptions are the Chatty Female Pal and the Demanding Boss, both chick-lit staples. Olivia herself is rather annoying, since she keeps tripping dizzily into danger and then freaking out. Still, she has some guts, even if they don't show up very often.<br /><br />Despite the ditziness of the heroine, \\"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination\\" is an amusing light foray for Helen Fielding. Just hope there is no sequel -- Olivia and her antics will wear thin easily.re the Chatty Female Pal and the Demanding Boss, both chick-lit staples.

No Dungeons & Dragons or Tolkien ripoffs here. Instead, a well-written, intelligent historical fantasy, which reportedly took Clarke a decade to write. With a story this rich, it was worth the wait.<br /><br />It's the early 19th century, in England. The Napoleanic wars threaten England, but that's not the only struggle going on. Magic is all but dead in England; the so-called magicians don't actually want to handle it, but want to leave it to old books and stories. Once the English magicians were powerful and respected, but now they just write boring essays about magic. Except for Mr. Norrell, a cautious little Yorkshire man who taught himself how to do magic.<br /><br />However, things take a twist when he gives his help in the battle against Napolean -- a new magician enters the scene, the enthusiastic and charming Jonathan Strange. The two magicians begin to work together, but things begin to go awry when Mr. Norrell realizes that Jonathan is attracted to all magic -- including the more dangerous varieties. He's increasingly fascinated by the legend of the Raven King, a changeling child who ruled Faerie and Earth...<br /><br />Historical fantasies have rarely been as detailed and rich as this one -- usually either the \\"historic\\" or the \\"fantasy\\" is abused. Often the best authors can do is write alternate universe stories where America lost the Revolution, the Roman Empire never fell, and so on. But Susanna Clarke shatters that with her richly-realized look at 19th-century Britain, with unique magic and a slight mythologic twist.<br /><br />Clarke keeps her writing solid, detailed and dignified, also footnoting extensively, with little wry winks and nudges to keep the book from being too serious. She has a flair for the historical parts of the book, keeping dates, battles, and political movement entwined in the plot. But she doesn't neglect the fantasy either; there's a mythic flavor in the story of the Raven King and the old magicians, reminiscent of old legends from ancient times. Her handling of magic is especially good -- less is more, and hints of past greatness make the magic all the more stunning.<br /><br />The title characters are the best of the book -- both are products of their times. Mr. Norrell is cautious, studious, ingenious and quiet, the sort of person you could imagine having a talk with Ben Franklin. Strange has more of the wild, society-be-damned wit that characterized some great artists of that time. And Norrell's faithful servant is just one of many solid supporting characters.<br /><br />If Jane Austen had written like Diana Wynne-Jones, the result would have been something like \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.\\" Well-written, enticing and thoroughly original, this is a keeper.neglect the fantasy either; there's a mythic flavor in the story of the Raven King and the old magicians, reminiscent of old legends from ancient times.

Taylor struck out with his much-hyped debut, the tepid religious fantasy \\"Shadowmancer.\\" And the follow-up, \\"Wormwood,\\" is even less engaging than \\"Shadowmancer\\" was -- while it's fairly well written, it's loosely strung together with dull characters and a plodding plot.<br /><br />In the mid 1700s, London is gripped by panic -- somehow the earth is overspinning, and suddenly stops so that London is plunged into permanent night. A young servant girl, Agetta, is terrified of what is going to happen, especially because her master, Kabbalah master and scientist Dr Sabian Blake, is predicting that a comet called Wormwood will strike the earth.<br /><br />This information comes from the mysterious book, Nemorensis, that Blake was given by a stranger. The Nemorensis supposedly contains all the secrets of the universe. Unfortunately, the book also exerts a sinister influence over Agetta. But in an attic is Tegatus, an angelic being who might just be the savior London needs...<br /><br />Religious fantasy, or fantasy with religious undertones, is not a bad thing -- J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis and others allowed their religions to influence their life's work. But G.P. Taylor not only has the subtlety of a battering ram -- he's also quite boring. The story plods along in a string of little plot-related scenes, without building up much momentum.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems is the way Taylor handles the fantastical elements of his book. Okay, there are weird creatures. Most fantasy books have those. But his seem to just be thrown into the mix for no apparent reason. His handling of superstition and science in the 1700s is sketchy at best, no matter how brilliant a scientist Blake is meant to be.<br /><br />Taylor has a decent enough writing style, and he has a certain flair for description and atmosphere. But his style is also very repetitive and over-the-top -- where are the editors when you need them? What's worse, his idea of creating a fantasy world seems to be to just toss in a few weird elements that have nothing to do with the plot. The actual fantasy plot is just more of Taylor's lukewarm, generic Christian sentiments.<br /><br />The characters are as thin as the pages. There are a lot of characters for a relatively slim fantasy book, and many of them are left underdeveloped. Blake and Agetta are the only ones who receive any character development, and that isn't saying much. Agetta in particular seems almost manic, considering how fast her moods swing. Tegatus is just freakin' boring.<br /><br />G.P. Taylor strikes out again with \\"Wormwood,\\" another dull religious fantasy that leaves a sour taste in the mouth.

Its sequel, \\"Destruction of the Books,\\" is very different -- darker, nastier, and taking on the promise of epic battles that were only hinted at in \\"Rover.\\"<br /><br />Librarion Juhg is the apprentice to the Grandmagister Wick of the hidden Library. When he hears a rumor of a rare book aboard a goblin ship, he and his ship's crew manage to get the book away -- but not without grappling with the goblins and an evil wizard. He brings it to Wick and the wizard Craugh, who try to figure out what is up with it.<br /><br />But the book is booby-trapped -- it allows horrifyingly evil creatures to swarm into the Library and destroy it from the inside out. The Library is in ruins, and four-fifths of the books are gone. With the dwellers refusing to help, and evil undead armies descending on them, Juhg must do whatever he can to save his friends -- and what remains of the Vault of All Known Knowledge.<br /><br />As evidenced by the big blinking \\"To Be Continued\\" on the end of this book, there's going to be much more. And it feels like a gradual windup to a spectacular battle, rather than part of the battle itself -- lots of talking, with the odd action scene. But in the last third of the book, Odom makes the plot suddenly spark to life, promising excellence in whatever comes next.<br /><br />Odom's writing is pretty good, descriptive and sometimes downright chilling. He does tend to launch into long conversations that talk about A) the importance of books, or B) how destroying books destroys civilization/history, and that gets annoying. However, when those conversations drop out of sight, the narrative speeds up and gets tenser, complete with the climactic battle with the undead goblin-beastie Boneblights.

Was McKiernan's first-written book, \\"Trek to Kraggen-Cor,\\" better than the ones published before it? Not that much. It's still a poor clone of J.R.R. Tolkien's masterful works.<br /><br />Perry is the descendent of the great Tuckerby Underbank, living in the Boskydells. As a rather nerdy scholar, he dreams of legendary battles and adventures -- and his fantasies come true when Lord Kian and two Dwarves show up on his doorstep. They need help reclaiming the ancient Dwarf citadel of Kraggen-Cor from the evil Spawn that have invaded, and Perry has memorized the old maps and directions.<br /><br />Perry's thrilled, but his handyman Cotton Buckleburr isn't that thrilled (since he wisely recognizes that war is messy, bloody, and deadly). They travel with Kian and the Dwarves, training and learning to fight as they go, and soon meet up with their allies, the Dwarf army and the Vanadurim. But Perry is about to find out that what's ahead is not a glorious battle, but a horrific slaughter...<br /><br />\\"Trek to Kraggen-Cor\\" is the sort of writing generally classified as \\"fanfic\\": stories written by fans of a TV show, movie, or book. McKiernan is clearly a huge fan of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- how else could he have taken so many details from Tolkien's masterful epic and transplanted them into a similar backdrop? Among things copied are the Dwarves, every single thing about Warrows, the evil villains, the Elves, and the Vanadurim. The whole thing stinks of Middle-Earth. Even small details smack of Tolkien's life's work.<br /><br />Very little actually happens in this book; most of it is talking, travelling, or both at once. It's even worse when they TALK about travelling. The trek to Kraggen-cor is excruciating, since McKiernan details every dull step of the way. The dialogue is a bit more relaxed, but there's too much melodrama (and, in Cotton's case, poorly-written country-Brit dialect). And McKiernan keeps fixating on hysterical laughter, clothing, and food -- at least one of these shows up regularly.<br /><br />Perry is apparently supposed to be a naive yet plucky hero. But he merely comes across as a massive drip who has no contact with reality. Cotton's folksy attitude wears thin, but he's an acceptable character. Kian really isn't very interesting; he's a pretty typical benevolent warrior-prince. The Dwarves are all utterly interchangeable, including Borin and Anval.<br /><br />The first is not always best, and such is true with \\"Trek To Kraggen-Cor.\\" Only if you liked his excruciating \\"Iron Tower\\" trilogy will you like the travesty of Dennis McKiernan's first duology.h melodrama (and, in Cotton's case, poorly-written country-Brit dialect).

He's rumored to be a monster. But when Jessa arrives, she finds that Kari is not a monster -- but a lonely young boy who has the power to destroy his scheming sorceress mother, and has been sent away because of that.<br /><br />After the death of the Jarl, Gudrun vanishes, and a new Jarl, Wulfgar, is chosen. And Kari vanishes back to the north for a few years, honing his magic abilities. But with power comes greater fear. Kari fears becoming like the evil Gudrun, and others fear his dark magic. Even Wulfgar begins to doubt him, especially when Kari is accused in a prophecy by a priest.<br /><br />But Kari and Jessa have more than just accusations to deal with. A monstrous, bearlike creature is coming to the Jarlshold, with Wulfgar as its target. And Wulfgar's bride's soul is stolen by Gudrun. Kari and his loyal friends band together to defeat the evil Snow-Walker -- but is the good in Kari enough to keep him from becoming like Gudrun?<br /><br />The first book by Catherine Fisher, \\"The Oracle Betrayed,\\" was a tepid mix of Greek and Egyptian cultures. She fares much better with the rich Norse mythology, against a backdrop of monsters, snow, ice, and sorcerous people with eyes like bits of ice. Werewolves, armies of dead men, villages on lakes,  and spirits conjured out of loneliness and misery are only part of this story.<br /><br />It's actually like a trilogy of novellas, each a little over 160 pages long -- \\"The Snow-Walker's Son,\\" \\"The Empty Hand,\\" and \\"The Soul Thieves.\\" With plenty of room to stretch, Fisher's writing is tense, descriptive, poetic, and simple. Her descriptions of magical beasts and phantoms are spellbinding. The main problem is that the climactic battles in \\"Soul Thieves\\" and \\"Snow Walker's Son\\" seem to finish too quickly and cleanly, although the finale is a satisfying one.<br /><br />Though the strong-willed Jessa is the lead character, Kari is the center of the novel -- a boy who never had a normal life, and has a lingering fear of being turned to evil. The supporting characters like Wulfgar, Kari's loyal guardian Brochael, crippled thrall Hakon and others are well-drawn. Gudrun isn't given much dimension (okay, she's evil and cruel, we got it), but her chilly plotting is well-done.<br /><br />Catherine Fisher is well-suited to the robust Norse legends of the snowy north, and the solid \\"Snow-Walker\\" is an excellent fantasy read for adults and teens alike.With plenty of room to stretch, Fisher's writing is tense, descriptive, poetic, and simple.

And in \\"Unexpected Magic,\\" Jones shows her flair for shorter works, with several previously published stories paired with a wonderful new novella.<br /><br />Jones presents us with plenty of stories, mostly fantasy but some that border on SF or horror. A kindly wizard falls for a sniping, obnoxious woman -- and his cats discover her horrible identity. Mum's obsession with her latest whims and fads leads to a plague of fuzzy pink mushrooms -- not to mention a minor family rebellion. A girl falls in love with the sun, and turns into a tree so that it will love her back.<br /><br />Elizabeth develops a friendship with her father's living walking stick, Carruthers. A robot called No One has difficulties following orders, especially with a house full of finicky appliances. Siglin is pursued by a witch-hunt for telepaths, on an alternative world where women rule. And a Boy and an undying cat set out to destroy an evil wizard.<br /><br />And finishing it up is the solid novella \\"Everard's Ride.\\" Cecilia and Alex are a pair of Victorian kids, who have an unexpected visitor when a richly-dressed outlaw arrives on their doorstep in the rain. But as they venture into another world that borders on ours, they find that not everyone is as benevolent as Lord Robert.<br /><br />Those who have collected Jones' short story collections will probably already have several stories from this book. but \\"Unexpected Magic\\" is made worth the while by \\"Everard's Ride,\\" a sprawling 200-page novella that could easily have been published on its own. It's not Jones' best work, but it is an entrancing and original fantasy tale.<br /><br />Jones' style is all over the map in this collection, since they come from different parts of her career. But it's always detailed and deftly written. She retains a sense of humor in many of the stories like \\"The Fluffy Pink Toadstool,\\" with its skewering of the all-natural-all-the-time lifestyle. At other times, she dips into an almost melancholy mood, such as \\"The Girl Who Loved the Sun.\\" One of the few duds is \\"The Fat Wizard,\\" which is just hard to decipher.<br /><br />Even if you already have the stories elsewhere, \\"Unexpected Magic\\" is worth getting just for the wonderful \\"Everard's Ride.\\" Full of humor, sweetness and plenty of cats, this is a good collection of Jones's writing.,\\" with its skewering of the all-natural-all-the-time lifestyle.

Odd things are MEANT to happen.\\" That remark, coming from galactic tyrant Emperor Zhark, sets the tone for Jasper Fforde's fourth book in the still-fresh Thursday Next series, \\"Something Rotten.\\" Funny, literate, and sometimes quite poignant, this proves that Fforde still has the spark.<br /><br />After a disastrous incident in the Wild West, Thursday Next decides to leave Jurisfiction, and goes home with her two-year-old son Friday. But things aren't more peaceful in the real world: The Goliath Corporation has become a religion, there's a politician named Yorrick Kaine blaming the Danes for everything, and a croquet match is set to determine the fate of the world. If they win, the Goliath Corporation (and Kaine) are finished. If they lose, the world has a 22% chance of Armageddon.<br /><br />Thursday's personal life is no easier. Her husband has been \\"eradicated,\\" and her mom's house is full of guests from Hamlet to a 13th-century seer. Now her only hope lies in somehow getting the Goliath Corporation to give her husband back, and in winning the cricket match (with the help of Hamlet and a bunch of Neanderthals). But Kaine and the Corporation aren't about to go down without a fight... and they might take Thursday down with them.<br /><br />Jasper Fforde won readers' hearts with the comedy/mystery/fantasy/satire \\"The Eyre Affair,\\" and kept winning them with the two sequels. Though \\"Well of Lost Books\\" was a bit shaky, \\"Rotten\\" gets its footing quickly. Any book that has Ophelia staging a coup and taking over the play must be a winner. But Fforde also wraps up some threads from the earlier books, such as Landen's eradication. The question of Thursday's punishment (for changing the end of \\"Jane Eyre\\") is also dealt with, in a poignant and unexpected twist.<br /><br />Fforde seems more comfortable than ever in his literate-spoof world. His writing is assured and detailed, with a few dizzy puns and plenty of English-major humor (like Hamlet being a Mel Gibson fan). He wraps dozens of seemingly random threads together, tying them off neatly at the end. The climactic fight between Thursday and Kaine is both funny and brilliant, as they set one literary creation against another (including Beowulf and the Jabberwock).<br /><br />The smart, tough-yet-loving Thursday is joined by a bunch of characters both lovable and infuriating, including her Latin-spouting tot Friday and a bunch of Neanderthals. Gran Next has a secret identity revealed, and Landen returns... spasmodically, on and off. Most winning are the exuberant Hamlet, and Thursday's brother, the Irreverend Joffy. Oddly enough, the villains -- such as Mr. Goliath and hit woman Cindy -- tend to be two-dimensional, but fictional ones (like Emperor Zhark) are enormous fun. Oh, the irony.<br /><br />Jasper Fforde returns with \\"Something Rotten,\\" a solid entry in the ongoing fantasy-detective series.

The lead: a single professional with a tumultuous love life and an unobtrusive job. Chick lit? Not exactly -- it's a book for guys. Like \\"Love Monkey,\\" John Dearie's debut novel is a sort of chick-lit for guys, well-written but too uneven.<br /><br />Jack Lafferty has no interest in settling down, especially when his beautiful, hypnotic fiancee Kim sleeps with a client three weeks before they were supposed to get married. While attending a pal's wedding, he meets the beautiful Sarah, and starts to form a friendly rapport with her -- and then to develop other feelings as well.<br /><br />Confused and rapidly falling for Sarah, Jack runs into his ex-fiancee and ends up in bed with her (courtesy of old feelings and alcohol).  He's wracked with guilt, but goes on a prearranged date with Sarah anyway. Everything goes well -- until Kim appears, and tells Sarah about what she did with Jack. Now Jack has lost Sarah -- unless he learns to be bold, to take risks with love, and find a way to win her heart and trust back.<br /><br />If men constantly wonder what women think about, then women think just the same about men. \\"Love and Other Recreational Sports\\" is a bit like listening in on a men's locker room conversation, especially since it's written by a guy as well. Some of his \\"insights\\" seem a bit cliched -- such as the subplot about the newlyweds -- but quite true to life as well.<br /><br />Dearie has a fairly pleasant writing style, about on par with average light fiction. But he doesn't quite know how to balance his book. He spends too much time having characters yammer about the intricacies of the male mind. Despite this, the plot itself is fairly interesting as it unfolds, watching as Jack tries to figure out what he wants to do.<br /><br />Despite having a male protagonist, it's hard to really like Jack until the last quarter of \\"Love.\\" Then he seems to develop some passion and drive, and drop his cynical, whiny attitude. It's pleasant to see his friendship with Sarah slowly bloom into real love and respect, despite the odds. Kim is a typical temptress type, while Jack's goofy pal Alex provides some welcome comic relief.<br /><br />\\"Love and Other Recreational Sports\\" is a beach read for both sexes -- intriguing to women, sympathetic to men.

And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.<br /><br />We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \\"Mad Baggins\\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.<br /><br />Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.<br /><br />Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the \\"feel\\" of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.<br /><br />Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.<br /><br />One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.<br /><br />Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say \\"everyhobbit.\\"<br /><br />We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit to someone bolder and more decisive. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.<br /><br />Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again.den sides and powers here.

And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.<br /><br />Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).<br /><br />So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.<br /><br />Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" --  especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.<br /><br />The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but multidimensional and immensely interesting to read about.<br /><br />\\"The Hobbit\\" was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and continue reading.

But the main problem is Belle Morte, who has taken a person interest in Anita -- and whose emissary is still able to cause trouble for Anita's \\"people.\\" And possibly death for Asher.<br /><br />Some lip service is paid to a serial killer and a gang of secret agents who, of course, want to enlist Anita's oh-so-impressive services. But that's not where Laurell K. Hamilton's interests lie -- it's pretty clear she is focusing on the endless parade of \\"who's on top?\\" vampire politics and all its courtly trappings, and in writing maybe/maybe not sex scenes.<br /><br />Problem is, she's not very good at it. The supposedly courtly etiquette of the vampires is staggeringly dull, with much hilarious talk of \\"American sex\\" (your basic sex) versus \\"European sex\\" (just about any kind of physical contact). And the sex scenes require endless before-during-after talking and ridiculous angst. At least two pages are required to get Asher out of his underwear. And her attempts at compelling, intense scenes -- such as the were rescue squad or the long-distance prods of Belle Morte -- end up laughably melodramatic.<br /><br />Worst of all, no sense of humor -- despite Anita's oh-so-witty barbs, the funniest line in the whole book is Asher announcing that he's known saints and priests who did not have the self-control of a nymphomaniacal narcissist. Add Hamilton's endless descriptions of anime-style flowing hair and brightly-colored eyes, and you have a recipe for tedious, slow-moving slogging.<br /><br />It's pretty evident that Anita is self-absorbed and not very bright, as well as a glaring Mary Sue with contrived angst and unreal sex powers. Everyone (including the villain and the government) wants her, because she's so tough and special, and despite the fact that she's utterly abrasive and a raging narcissist. Hamilton tries to cover this with protestations that she \\"loves\\" all the guys around her, but it's never convincing.<br /><br />But over the course of \\"Cerulean Sins\\" she becomes truly loathsome: emotionally manipulating the vulnerable, endlessly sniping at Richard, and refusing to let Asher leave unless he has sex with her. And while she admits that it's massively hypocritical to insist that Jean-Claude be faithful to her alone while she has sex with anything that will hold still, she insists on it anyway.<br /><br />Poor Asher. He gets put through the wringer in this one. After being stabbed by an old flame, he has to deal with Anita lying and manipulating him so he'll have \\"European sex\\" with her, and apparently not caring how distraught it makes him. The poor guy deserves better.<br /><br />\\"Cerulean Sins\\" is a long, tedious slog of painfully boring sex, painfully boring dialogue, and painfully boring vampire politics that exists just to be talked about. A ghastly experience.astly experience.	2004-09-04

Soap opera? Well, sort of -- it's Nobel Prize Winner John Galsworthy's sprawling family epic \\"The Forsyte Saga.\\" While it has a distinctly soapy flavor, \\"Saga\\" retains its dignity and look at turn-of-the-century mores and society.<br /><br />The Forsyte family is determinedly regal and hard-nosed, almost to the point of a fault. One staid family member, Soames Forsyte, becomes obsessed with the beautiful but poor Irene, and finally gets her to marry him -- on condition that if their marriage doesn't work, she walks. Well, their marriage doesn't work. Soames is frustrated that Irene shuts him out of her life and her bed -- even more so when he learns that she is in love with sexy, arty architect Bosinney, who is building them a new house.<br /><br />Soames rapes Irene and ruins Bosinney. His marriage falls into ruins, and Bosinney is killed in a car accident. So Irene leaves permanently, living in an apartment by herself. Then Soames announces that he wants to marry a pretty French girl, Annette, and Irene weds Soames' cousin. But the problems of the older generation get inherited by the younger one -- Soames's daughter falls madly in love with Irene's son, but their parents' secret pasts doom their love.<br /><br />Three novels (\\"A Man of Property,\\" \\"In Chancery,\\" and \\"To Let\\"), connected with two short stories (\\"Indian Summer of a Forsyte\\" and \\"Awakening\\") -- it's a pretty big story, sprawling over three generations and four decades. It's a bit soapy, with all the scandal and family weirdness, but the dignified writing keeps it from seeming sordid.<br /><br />It's a credit to Galsworthy that he can communicate so much without ever getting into his characters' heads. He displays emotion in undemonstrative people like Irene through little mannerisms and twitches. At the same time, he can give us heartrending looks into aging patriarch Old Jolyon's lonely mind. His writing is very nineteenth century, dignified and with plenty of furniture/clothing details. It's pretty dense, but all right once you get used to it.<br /><br />Galsworthy was a solid supporter of women's rights, and you can see in Irene and Soames' relationship -- Soames, who sees his wife as another piece of property, and the determined Irene who only wants her own happiness, but can't afford to live on her own. Their respective kids Jon and Fleur are nice but kind of boring beside their darker, more intense parents.<br /><br />For a look at the social shifts that helped define the twentieth century, take a look at the \\"Forsyte Saga.\\" Or if you just want to soak in a tale of family woe, love, hate and dark secrets, \\"Saga\\" still works.ng is very nineteenth century, dignified and with plenty of furniture/clothing details.

Books	3	10	10	N	N	Intermittently amusing light read	Can you write a  short story in only 55 words? Sure. Making it a GOOD ultra-short story is the challenge. And \\"The World's Shortest Stories\\" is an amusing light read, with many so-so stories, some duds, and some little hidden gems that might make you smile.<br /><br />The majority of the stories are made up mostly of dialogue, with a twist (like piranhas or bigamy) at the end. Each one takes about ten seconds maximum to read. There's love (a werewolf has a tendency to kill his girlfriends on the full moon), murder (a sex kitten turns out to be a hit woman), terrible puns (\\"Abra-cadaver!\\") and sex (\\"Brenda promised the horizontal hokey-pokey if he wore a chicken suit and spoke French\\").<br /><br />Some of the short stories feel unfinished, as if the author had a good idea but couldn't follow it through. And others are downright dour, rarely managing to get any sort of emotion from the reader; an exception was \\"It Was a Year Ago,\\" a gut-wrencher about drunk driving. But more often it's maudlin, emotionless vignettes like \\"Photographer's Regrets.\\"<br /><br />But perhaps two-thirds of the humorous stories manage to evoke a smile or  little laugh, like \\"Harry's Love,\\" about a man's adoration for his curvacious, golden, sensuous... trumpet. And a few of them give twists that will get a grin out of you, like \\"Dragon Tale,\\" about a peculiar tattoo. Not to mention the vampire support meeting.<br /><br />\\"The World's Shortest Stories\\" has quite a few duds sprinkled through the hits, but it's still an amusing -- and very short -- book of even shorter stories.	2004-09-02

But there are only so many good fantasy series out there, and the sequel anthology \\"Legends II\\" has a deadweight of tepid stories.<br /><br />Silverberg himself contributes a story in his classic Mahjipoor series, an eerie tale of Mahjipoor's early history; George Martin provides a solid prequel for his dark epic Song of Fire and Ice series, while Tad Williams gives an insight into the post-death activities of a supporting character from the Otherland series, complete with a funny Tolkien homage (\\"Fare thee well also, Tharagorn, Cuddler of Elves\\"), and Terry Brooks gives an enticing if rushed epilogue to \\"Wishsong of Shannara.\\" And Neil Gaiman provides a short-ish sequel featuring the hero of his \\"American Gods\\" book, an eerie dark gem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are some very sketchy choices to round off the volume. Elizabeth Haydon's cataclysmic novella is bogged down by her overdramatic writing and overemotional characters. Anne McCaffrey's story is weirdly anticlimactic, as if she changed her mind what she wanted to happen in the \\"Moreta\\" book. And what is Diana Gabaldon's bizarre \\"Lord John and the Succubus\\" doing in this? It's more historical romance than fantasy.<br /><br />The problem with \\"Legends II\\" is that it feels cobbled together, as if Silverberg chose whichever bestselling fantasies he could find (short of the \\"Harry Potter\\" series), and ignored the quality. At least it includes a wide range of fantasy. There's historical fantasy (Orson Scott Card's alternate US), sci-fantasy (Tad Williams), and dark fantasy that verges on horror (Neil Gaiman).<br /><br />Perhaps a few of these stories were last-minute additions, since apparently a couple of authors pulled out. As it is, it feels rushed -- there's little of the gut-wrenching horror of King's novella, or the minimalist splendor of Le Guin's story. The overall collection feels, in a word, bland, despite some fairly good offerings.<br /><br />\\"Legends II\\" fails to live up to the promise of its predessor, but it would have been a solid anthology if a few of the novellas were trimmed away.

And in her third American release, she shows no sign of slowing. \\"Dragon Rider\\" is a solid draconian fantasy, although laced with a bit too much whimsy.<br /><br />In fantasy stories, peaceful valleys are prime targets. This one is no exception -- the home of a clan of dragons is being threatened. So the silver-skinned Firedrake sets out to find the Rim of Heaven, which may be the sanctuary they need. Along the way he and his brownie sidekick Sorrel pick up a human boy, Ben, who wats to help them out.<br /><br />But their quest is being complicated by Nettlebrand, a strange manmade dragon with metal scales and a serious attitude problem, and a bow-and-scraping homunculus. Nettlebrand's goal is to destroy Firedrake and the other dragons, unless Firedrake, Ben and Sorrel can defeat him, and find the Rim of Heaven.<br /><br />Cornelia Funke strays into lighter turf with \\"Dragon Rider,\\" which was originally written seven years back. It's not lightweight exactly, but it lacks some of the somberness of her past two books. It's not vaguely dark like \\"Thief Lord,\\" and it doesn't have the overstrained seriousness of \\"Inkheart.\\" Rather it feels like Funke loosened up and decided to just write something more whimsical.<br /><br />No Anne McCaffrey dragons here -- Funke doesn't overburden readers with the nitty-gritty of dragons. At times she does take the whimsy too far (a dragon living on moonlight? What's up with that?). However, her solid writing and fantasy trappings avoid being precious, and add a grounded feel to a 100% fantastical storyline.<br /><br />And Funke doesn't fail readers with her characters. Firedrake, Ben and Sorrel are likable and well-rounded, and while Twigleg the homunculus gets annoying, he's well-done. Nettlebrand is an intriguingly original villain, although he could have used a few more motivations.<br /><br />While \\"Dragon Rider\\" can be a bit overwhimsical at times, it's a pleasant, more laid-back fantasy that brings Lloyd Alexander's standalone fantasies to mind.

Full of invented legends and exotic characters, Dunsany's short stories are a wonderful early fantasy read.<br /><br />He writes about desert cities, where the sea is only a legend; of a rocking horse that revels in a little boy's fantasies; of cities that are \\"quite dead; of dreams and redemption, long-dead cities that were supposedly going to last forever, prophets and swords, desert curses and terrible, beautiful gods.<br /><br />There are boats on the banks of the Yann river, the \\"everlasting\\" city of Zaccarath, a stone age tale of religion and sacrifice, and the hashish man. Most striking is \\"The Field,\\" in which Dunsany experiences strange feelings while sitting in a field of flowers -- a field with a terrible secret.<br /><br />Dunsany had a masterful flair for exotic-edged fantasy. Before anyone had ever heard of J.R.R. Tolkien or \\"The Hobbit,\\" Dunsany was spinning his stories. And while Tolkien has been the most powerful influence on modern fantasy, Dunsany did his share too -- he can be seen in descriptions of beautiful temples and desert cities.<br /><br />His writing style is typical of the late 19th/early 20th century, rather formal and ornate. But the imagination of the stories frees them up. \\"I dreamt that I had done a horrible thing, so that burial was to be denied me either in soil or sea, neither could there be any hell for me,\\" Dunsany says ominously at the start of one story. And half the horror of that is wondering what the horrible thing is.<br /><br />Dunsany is shown in his glory in \\"The Dreamer's Tales,\\" a rich collection of beautiful fantasy stories. Funny, poignant, majestic, this is a keeper.	2004-08-27

His stories are grotesque, whimsical, humorous and solemn. And, of course, \\"The Book of Wonder\\" is brimming over with unique fantasy stories.<br /><br />It's a mix of all kinds of fantasy tales: a man whose interest in his imaginary land eclipses the real world; a magical window that shows amazing things; suitors try to make a cold-hearted queen cry; the story of the Gibbelins, who eat \\"nothing less good than man\\"; and of Miss Cubbins and the Dragon of Romance. Most entertaining is the tale of Chu-bu and Sheemish: idol Chu-bu is inceansed when a new idol (Sheemish) is moved into his temple. And their resulting squabble has the power to level a city.<br /><br />Dunsany's fantasies aren't as vibrantly realistic as J.R.R. Tolkien's, or as pensive as C.S. Lewis's. Instead they're like fantastical, melancholy little paintings. Some are whimsical like \\"Miss Cubbins and the Dragon of Romance\\" or \\"Chu-Bu and Sheemish,\\" while others are majestic and vaguely mythic, like \\"How One Came, As It Was Foretold, To the City of Never.\\"<br /><br />Dunsany's writing is lush and descriptive, but in the slightly distant style of the late nineteenth/early twentieth century. \\"Night was roaming away with his cloak trailed behind him, with mists turned over and over as he went,\\" Dunsany writes. He handled comedy, tragedy, horror, and made-up legends with skill and imagination. And though his made-up legends and myths aren't actually in this book, you can see hints of it in some of the stories.<br /><br />\\"The Book of Wonder\\" is an excellent collection of some of Dunsany's best short stories, both funny and frightening. Vivid and beautifully written, this early fantasy writer is a must-have.	2004-08-27

Tolkien is often credited with creating the fantasy genre as we know it. But Dunsany was one of the handful of fantasy writers who came first -- even creating mythical gods, cities, heroes and legends before Tolkien penned the Silmarillion. As a result, his stories are refreshingly original and untainted by any other writer's work.<br /><br />Dunsany wrote enchantingly in this book. His prose is majestic and lush in manner, which may scare off people who prefer lighter reads. This isn't something that can be skimmed, like the Bible or the Iliad can't be skimmed. They're too complex, and too rich. Dunsany had an exquisite manner of writing, and he never skimps on lush details and beautiful descriptions.<br /><br />Fans of classic fantasy -- or readers looking for something fresh and thoroughly cliche-free -- might enjoy \\"Time and the Gods,\\" with Dunsany's rich writing and imagination.	2004-08-27

Since she has managed to get engaged to a married man, and might be hit with a scandal, Lorelei goes overseas. She cuts a gold-digging swathe through Europe, dazzling wealthy men, seeing the \\"Eyefull\\" Tower, and recording thoughts both witty and vapid.<br /><br />Loos followed up her hit novel with \\"But Gentlemen Prefer Brunettes.\\" The sequel is the story of Lorelei's travelling buddy Dorothy, as told by Lorelei. Dorothy has led a more colorful life -- she started off in the circus before heading to NYC. There, she became a Ziegfield Follies Girl, and then a \\"companion\\" to wealthy men.<br /><br />Anita Loos's \\"Gentlemen\\" books first started when Loos encountered a starlet who had men tripping over themselves to help her with her things. Loos was as pretty, as young, and much smarter, but nobody helped her. What was different? Loos was a brunette, and the starlet was a blonde. You do the math.<br /><br />Loos had a fun, deft sense of humor. She skewered flappers and/or gold-diggers, wealthy men, and the social mores of the 1920s. She also deliberately litters her books with misspellings and run-on sentences, adding to the feeling of overal ditziness. At the same time, her books are such good light fun that they can be read without taking note of the satire.<br /><br />\\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes\\" gives a wink-nudge look at the flapper era, while giving us the origins of the present-day lite chick-lit genre.

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home.

Acting in hundreds of movies, this impressive British thespian has had a life even more interesting than his career. In \\"Lord of Misrule,\\" Lee describes his long life with humor and solemn clarity, and with almost too many stories for the book to hold.<br /><br />Christopher Carandini Lee was born in 1922, to an Italian countess (who was descended from Italian royalty) and a soon-gone British soldier. His was an unusual childhood masked by a conventional British schoolboy's life. At the age of seventeen his world (along with his stepfather's finances) suddenly began to come apart. He fought in World War II, in the Royal Air Force, only to dip back into acting.<br /><br />Lee rapidly became known as one of the best villains of the movie business, playing Dracula alone a staggering ten times. Here he recounts how he acted with legendary actors like Errol Flynn (who mangled his finger) or his good pal, monster great Boris Karloff (complete with lisping jokes); his marriage; the good, bad and ugly of his varied career; and finally two of his most prominent roles: the evil wizard Saruman of J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and Count Dooku of the \\"Star Wars\\" prequel trilogy.\\"<br /><br />Technically, \\"Lord of Misrule\\" isn't an entirely new book -- it was once published as \\"Tall Dark and Gruesome.\\" But here it's updated with new information and photographs from the past few years. Not to mention a friendly foreword by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" director Peter Jackson, which serves as a good warm-up.<br /><br />Lee himself has a very formal, erudite way of writing, sprinkled with literary references to P.G. Wodehouse and G.K. Chesterton. (And Tolkien, of course) But don't think this book is stuffy. If anything, the eighty-plus years of Lee's life zip by too fast. He clearly has a wealth of stories to tell, and the book is barely big enough to contain them.<br /><br />Lee also strikes a good balance between humor and darkness. In one taut anecdote, he describes how his daughter was born with deformed feet. In another, he wryly describes how he used to scurry across the Italian border dressed as a girl. It's also augmented by plenty of photos. Some are professional photos, but many are personal photos -- Lee with his wife and daughter, or his friends, at his investiture, or as a bright-eyed baby.<br /><br />Very few actors have lived a life even half as interesting as the roles they have played, but Christopher Lee is one of the few.

The conclusions get even worse when she sees a hickey on his neck, not knowing that a grieving, half-asleep male friend gave it to him.<br /><br />Godai's life doesn't get much better when Grandma Godai comes for an indefinite period of time, and starts meddling in his love life, getting the dog drunk, and going to a disco. Overwhelmed and depressed, he goes on a trip elsewhere and encounters a chatterbox hiker, then falls into a well with Kyoko during a festival. And in the \\"Lost Episode: Yusaku's Island,\\" everyone is stranded on a deserted island, where Kyoko and Yusaku try to keep the others from partying.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the sixth Maison Ikkoku volume is that it feels a little like it's in a holding pattern -- there really isn't any advancement, unless you count Kyoko biting Yusaku's shoulder. That, and the baseball and marooned-on-a-deserted-island plots are a bit overdone. However, Takahashi's deft sense of humor and strange characters keep the plot floating.<br /><br />Certainly the storyline about the acid-tongued Grandma Godai is funny -- she doesn't think her wishy-washy grandson has a chance with Kyoko, but she's trying to help him anyway. A development fans will like: Yusaku and Kyoko actually go on a date, only to run into the crazies from Maison Ikkoku. And Takahashi's delicious humor (like the drunken Mrs. Ichinose jumping into the already-fully well) is what keeps the plot moving.<br /><br />Yusaku hasn't changed too much, but in this storyline his ego takes some blows when he sees Mitaka's luxurious condo, and hears constant derision of his hopes to win Kyoko. And Kyoko's muddled feelings get even more complex. And Grandma Godai is a fun character of Yoda-like stature, still possessing plenty of vitality (even if she keeps talking about dying).<br /><br />The sixth volume of Maison Ikkoku doesn't really move the plot forward, but it's still a fun, romantic, cute story-line.

He ran into a few dead ends (like his flirtation with socialism) and didn't get into the Japanese army during WW2 (something he was quite grateful for). But then Kurosawa fell headlong into scriptwriting and directing -- something that would make him famous around the world.<br /><br />Usually when people talk about Kurosawa, they mention \\"Star Wars.\\" And yes, Kurosawa's \\"Hidden Fortress\\" was a shaping influence on George Lucas. But Kurosawa gave the world plenty of other movie flourishes: the \\"wipe\\" effect between scenes, slow motion, pointing a camera at the sun, and many other things.<br /><br />Kurosawa really gives insight into his heart and his artistry in this. Masterfully told, it's about the various parts of his life -- boyhood, adolescence, maturity, and everything in between. It's not about the making of each film, but mainly the things that were most memorable. After reading this, you'll have newfound respect for screenwriters and directors, and everything they struggle with.<br /><br />But Kurosawa keeps a sense of humor about himself too. He admits frankly when he did something stupid or ignorant. And he relates some very funny anecdotes, such as his odd marriage proposal: \\"It looks as if we are going to lose the war, and if it comes to the point of the Honorable Death of the Hundred Million, we all have to die anyway. It's probably not a bad idea to find out what married life is like before that happens.\\" Amazingly, despite a proposal like that, he got married. And in retrospect, Kurosawa seems entirely aware of how odd it sounds.<br /><br />Kurosawa not only elaborates on his filmmaking, but his formative years as well -- a \\"slow\\" boy with a love of kendo and painting. His childhood was full of those events that seem insignificant to an adult, but he remembers them clearly as being deeply momentous at the time. He also describes his family as well -- his rebellious brother, sweet-natured mother, and strict father. One rather disappointing thing is about his wife, Yôko Yaguchi. He was married to Yaguchi for forty years and had two children with her, yet doesn't talk much about her.<br /><br />Akira Kurosawa wrote a lively and engaging memoir in \\"Something Like An Autobiography. Honest, intriguing and insightful, it's a good read for anyone, not just movie buffs.nd in retrospect, Kurosawa seems entirely aware of how odd it sounds. <br /> <br />Kurosawa not only elaborates on his filmmaking, but his formative years as well -- a \\"slow\\" boy with a love of kendo and painting.

The concept of the Fabulous Girl (FG) first came up in Kim Izzo and Ceri Marsh's first book, \\"The Fabulous Girl's Guide to Decorum.\\" But they belly-flop in their second book, \\"The Fabulous Girl's Guide To Grace Under Pressure,\\" primarily because it comes across as a retread of the first book.<br /><br />What do you do if you have a crush on a coworker -- and you already have a guy? How do you deal with a scandal? Being caught in flagrante by your boss? (Hint: Say it will never happen again!) And what about blind date etiquette? Izzo and Marsh cover these problems and many more, covering friends, sex, dating, work and longtime relationships.<br /><br />For a modern woman, the field of etiquette can be a tricky one. How can you be courteous at your work and everyday life, without losing the necessary toughness? Izzo and Marsh have a fair number of tips for where the lines should be drawn. Good tips, bad tips, and really ugly tips (\\"He proposes, but you're not ready\\").<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Guide to Grace\\" is that it treads very little new turf. Like its predecessor, it's mostly about manners. Not serious pressure. And when reading tips on relationships and workplace problems, there's a certain feeling of deja vu. It's like Izzo and Marsh had to write another book, but couldn't quite think of enough original material, so they retread old ground.<br /><br />What's more, it doesn't really handle situations that are \\"under pressure.\\" Okay, you have a friend who is a wolf in sheep's clothing. How is that \\"pressure\\"? It's a mildly sticky situation, but certainly not anything to get too worked up about. There are a handful of situations that are genuinely tense -- such as advice on stalker ex-boyfriends -- but there's a lot more on how to avoid embarrassment. Not sticky, not tricky, not outrageous -- just moderately embarrassing.<br /><br />Kim Izzo and Ceri Marsh boldly go where they've already gone in \\"The Fabulous Girl's Guide to Grace Under Pressure.\\" While it has some fairly interesting tips -- but nothing too \\"pressured\\" -- this book ends up feeling stale and thin as a month-old Saltine.ure.\\" While it has some fairly interesting tips -- but nothing too \\"pressured\\" -- this book ends up feeling stale and thin as a month-old Saltine.	2004-08-21

And he gives those artistic sensibilities a workout in \\"45301,\\" a stunning collection of photographs that takes the mundane surroundings of various countries, and transform them.<br /><br />Light is the core of \\"45301\\" -- soft light, sharp light, colorful light and light being smothered by shadows. Even color comes second to the presence of light. There are smoldering abstract images that look like they're about to burn through the page -- the pictures are that striking and that vivid. And then there then smoky, ghostly shots of what look like mountains.<br /><br />Mortensen's focus on the seemingly ordinary continues in this book. There are images of blurred, chaotic trees, the melancholy skyscape of \\"Hacia Mariel,\\" or the quiet, chilly movement of \\"Fototeca.\\" More color and movement is found in images like the intense glow of a dying campfire, or the dramatic image of riders silhouetted against a colorful sky.<br /><br />There isn't any writing in the conventional sense, unless you count the picture index. The photographs in \\"45031\\" are overlaid on examples of Mortensen's handwriting. It's often indecipherable, scribbled out and either thin and pale, or dark and sprawling. That makes it even more enticing, and an effective frame for such enigmatic photographs.<br /><br />And Mortensen again shows his ability to make the mundane seem magical. Horses, riders, trees, sky, clouds and houses all get the treatment, either shown in motion, shot from unusual angles, or in a strangely distorted manner. And of course, light and color are what the magic of the pictures sometimes depends on -- a strangely colored sky is all it takes to lend the photo an eerie look.<br /><br />Given its gritty, otherworldly look, \\"45031\\" is a strangely dizzying book to read. With entrancing abstract photos and a unique format, this is another winning collection by Viggo Mortensen.	2004-08-19

While \\"Sphere\\" has a steady plot and a fair amount of charm, Asaro's built world is a bit bland and simple. But fans of romantic fantasy will enjoy the quirky lead characters.<br /><br />Chime is an ordinary girl in a village -- except she has a magical ability that she keeps hidden. But the king's mage shows up one day and whisks her away, saying that she is powerful enough to be not only a mage, but the future queen. The king's rather foppish nephew Lord Muller is as displeased by this as Chime is, but they gradually warm up to one another.<br /><br />Then Chime's rival Iris has a sudden burst in magical ability, reaching out to the king's long-lost son Jarid, who is even more powerful. As Iris marries and heals the tortured Jarid, both Muller and Chime find themselves displaced from the roles they thought they would have. But they don't have much time to feel sorry for themselves, since a neighboring kingdom is threatening them, and even Jarid is a possible threat to those around them...<br /><br />Catherine Asaro doesn't seem entirely comfortable writing fantasy -- \\"Charmed Sphere\\" is a pleasant fantasy that seems geared at adults and teens (preferably ones who like a little romantic sparring). Just about everything in it is relatively fluffy and good, but not great.<br /><br />The setting is pretty standard ye-old-medieval-European-kingdom, without much to really make it stand out. Her ideas about magic -- which are wrapped up in geometry and color -- are surprisingly unique. And her writing is good. Not outstanding, but good and descriptive, and keeping a good pace going. But Asaro really shines in some of the darker scenes, like descriptions of Jarid's inner thoughts.<br /><br />Chime is a good heroine, a tomboyish country girl who wanted to stay where she was. And the magic-impaired Muller, who is initially more interested in clothes than being king, makes a good foil to Chime. But the supporting characters like Iris, and aging mage Della, tend to be 2-D and not terribly compelling. The exception is Jarid, who is tormented by his inner demons.<br /><br />\\"Charmed Sphere\\" is less than charmed, but it is an amusing middleweight story.

It's a solid fantasy romp with some sharp social commentary and chilling wizardry, but it suffers from somewhat less of the delightfully observant Bartimaeus.<br /><br />It's been two years since budding magician Nathaniel summoned the djinn Bartimaeus, and the two ended up enmeshed in a bizarre conspiracy. Now Nathaniel is working his way up in the world of politics and magic, with the sardonic Bartimaeus as his servant. But then the two end up in another hair-raising adventure -- a golem is attacking people in London, and Nathaniel is trying to find out who sent it, and why.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the resistance against the magicians is growing, and the golem is supposedly an instrument against the magicians. But that isn't quite the case. Instead, a fiery young resistance member, Kitty, is doing some plotting of a very different sort -- and her plans will bring her neck-to-neck with Nathaniel and Bartimaeus.<br /><br />Stroud takes readers to a parallel world where England is ruled not by bluebloods, but by wizards. It's not a new idea, but he gives it a new spin by wrapping it in political power as well as magic. If the backstabbing mage's world of the first book wasn't chilling enough, Stroud presents the eerie Night Police in this one.<br /><br />Stroud's writing is solid and detailed, with plenty of gloomy atmosphere and the occasional hair-raising episode. Perhaps the biggest flaw of this book is that the action more often than not focuses on Nathaniel rather than the cynically lovable Bartimaeus. However, it's to Stroud's credit that he can make the intricate political plotting so interesting, while mixing in some grimly funny magic as well.<br /><br />Nathaniel is still a flawed anti-hero, like Harry Potter's more ambitious cousin. While he's a passable lead character, the one who really steals all the scenes is Bartimaeus. He doesn't appear nearly enough, but his acerbic observations tend to be right on the money. And Kitty is a more likable person than Nathaniel, with a bit more fire in her personality.<br /><br />The sequel to \\"Amulet of Samarkand\\" suffers from a lack of djinn, but Jonathan Stroud manages to keep it going at a steady pace. \\"The Golem's Eye\\" is a creepy fantasy read, for anyone seeking something a bit darker and deeper than Harry Potter.n't appear nearly enough, but his acerbic observations tend to be right on the money.

But \\"Sex With Kings: 500 Years of Adultery, Power, Rivalry and Revenge\\" is a genuinely engrossing book, full of funny and tragic stories about royal mistresses through history. From Madame de Pompadour to Camilla Parker-Bowles, Eleanor Hermann studies these controversial -- sometimes fascinating -- women.<br /><br />There are mistresses of all types: married and single, noble and low-born, beautiful and ugly, smart and stupid. Some befriended the queens, some attacked (and were attacked by) them. Some died alone and unhappy, some became nuns, and some lived in luxury to the end. Some were sweet and pious, and some were nightmares. Hermann studies why the kings got involved with these women, and how brains and sweet natures could mean a lot more than a pretty face. They could (sometimes) influence politics, succession, and their illegitimate children were sometimes better-loved than the king's legitimate kids.<br /><br />The mistresses themselves are a colorful bunch, from the bratty, grasping Lola Montez, bawdy Nell Gwynn, pious Louise, and the legendary Madame de Pompadour. One of the most memorable is the grasping Madame de Montespan, who used black magic to ensnare the king, only to eventually drive him into the arms of a \\"batlike\\" governess.<br /><br />Yes, it's called \\"Sex with Kings.\\" But it's not all about sex -- in fact, it becomes clear that sex is only one factor. Hermann does a pretty good job of studying all angles of mistresshood. Sure, a mistress sometimes got the prettiest dresses and jewels, but she could be kicked out on a whim. There were dozens of setbacks, and only a very wily mistress could avoid them. The author also devotes attention to the mistress's children, her lover the king, and sometimes the mistress's husband. Even the unfortunate queen gets a chapter, as well as the occasional mistress who married the king.<br /><br />But Hermann keeps it funny and light as well. One particularly funny story is of a plain German princess and a French transvestite prince -- both of whom ask how they can possibly sleep with the other. But she doesn't avoid the touchier issues of mistresses either, like the religious or political angles. Nor does she cater to double standards by blaming either the kings or mistresses.<br /><br />Hermann finishes up the book on a promising note, pointing out recent marriages between royal men and the title-less women they love. But even if mistresshood is a thing of the past, the unique story of these women is well mapped-out in \\"Sex With Kinds.\\" A fun and unique read.articularly funny story is of a plain German princess and a French transvestite prince -- both of whom ask how they can possibly sleep with the other.

Robert Rankin does a passable job in a light-as-air fantasy/mystery, which succeeds more in its sly spoofing of fairy-tales and nursery rhymes than it does as a mystery.<br /><br />Teenager Jack is going to the city to make his fortune (in true fairy-tale style), after a lifetime of sweatshop misery. Despite the efforts of a homicidal farmer, he makes it there -- only to end up in Toy Town, where teddy bears, dolls, and nursery rhyme figures roam the streets. After being mugged, he's taken under the wing (paw?) of  a living teddy bear and detective, Eddie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Eddie's boss Bill Winkie has vanished with a large advance fee, and so Jack agrees to fill in. The case: Humpty Dumpy was mysteriously boiled in his swimming pool. Then Little Boy Blue is spitted on a shepherd's crook. Finally Madame Goose is plucked and strangled, and Eddie goes missing -- and at each crime, a chocolate bunny is left. With only a few clues and a bunch of chocolate bunnies, Jack sets out to find the sinister serial killer...<br /><br />Fantasy satire -- NOT mystery -- is clearly Robert Rankin's strong point. Sure, there is suspense and mystery, but that's not really what catches your attention. Instead, it's the wickedly funny idea of Mother Goose (also known as \\"Madam Goose\\") running a brothel, a horse named Anthrax, or a hard-boiled teddy bear detective who bleeds sawdust.<br /><br />Rankin's bizarre sense of humor bleeds through in dozens of ways, like the intricate question of whether Humpty Dumpy jumped off the wall, due to depression and an eating disorder, or the details of Jack Spratt's divorce. He never misses an opportunity to turn G-rated fluff into wickedly funny spoofs. His writing itself is spare in the Terry Pratchett style, except for the draggy first chapters and the somewhat limp finale.<br /><br />Jack is a model for the fairy-tale hero -- naive, clueless about the real world, with the occasional brainstorm. Not much personality beyond that. Kindly yet hard-boiled, brothel-frequenting teddy bear Eddie is one character that could have been a disaster, but is insanely funny instead; most of the supporting characters are one-note, but few of them appear for long.<br /><br />Robert Rankin produces an amusing light fantasy, with a fitful serial-killer storyline.

Carrie Karasyov and Jill Kargman don't forge much new territory, but they manage to craft a beach read with a likable lead and storylines straight out of a guilty-pleasure soap.<br /><br />Melanie is newly married to coffin mogul Arthur Korn. But now the honeymoon is over, and she is desperately trying to fit into his world -- a chic, coded world that sees her as a trailer-park upstart and ex-stewardess. And the harder she tries to impress, the nastier everyone is to her. And unknown to her, Arthur is besotted with a gorgeous socialite-author.<br /><br />Her neighbors have problems of their own -- Morgan Vance is being threatened by his trashy mistress Maria, whom he has just had a baby with. Problem is, Morgan has just realized how he loves his wife -- and he's willing to hire a hit man to get Maria out of his life. Meanwhile, one horrible interview shatters Melanie's chances of ever making it in high society -- until she figures out what is really important.<br /><br />\\"The Right Address\\" is one of those books that you'll enjoy a lot more than you think you should. It's a guilty pleasure, with soapy subplots and dirty little secrets. Some of the stories -- like the Mexican maid mistress -- are kind of over the top. But in the end, the story is an amusing light read -- nothing more, nothing else.<br /><br />Kargman and Karasyov do manage to avoid one deadly sin of Manhattanite chick-lit -- they don't name-drop. Well, they do, but mostly in a negative way -- rather than necessities, designer labels are part of the clique atmosphere. If you don't have THIS designer or get special purses from THAT person, you are gauche -- end of story.<br /><br />Most of the writing is quite ordinary, except for the occasional spurt of wit (a chaotic room is called \\"total Iraq\\"). But one of the most striking passages of the book is a pleasant interlude where the shunned Melanie goes walking in one of the un-chic areas of New York, and comes to a stunning realization. Nor, for all their barbs, do the authors descend into vengeful vitriol.<br /><br />Melanie is a likable character -- she always tries her best, is honest and genuinely kind, but she doesn't fit in a world of artificiality. Morgan is almost a cliche of the cheating man, but his increasingly lost wife Cordelia is a character almost as nice as Melanie. And the swarms of acid-tongued socialites are loathsome and catty in a rather over-the-top way.<br /><br />If Plum Sykes' \\"Bergdorf Blondes\\" had you gagging with distaste, then \\"Right Address\\" might be the antidote.

Her entertainingly fluffy satire \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\\" certainly fits the bill, with its love-seeking heroine and amusing jokes. It never dips far below the surface, but its lightness is part of its appeal.<br /><br />\\"A gentleman friend and I were dining at the Ritz last evening and he said that if I took a pencil and a paper and put down all of my thoughts it would make a book.\\" Meet Lorelei Lee, a pretty blonde socialite with a love of jewels, men, and luxury. She has a married boyfriend, but is convinced to go abroad so her name won't be \\"smirched.\\"<br /><br />So Lorelei and her pal Dorothy head off to Europe, bumping into exalted people (like \\"Dr. Froyd\\") and winning the hearts of wealthy men, in between days-long parties. Gold-digging, millionaires, money and love all get wrapped up in the tangle of Lorelei's everyday life...<br /><br />Lorelei first appeared in Harper's Bazaar, and a short story stretched out into a full-length novel that appeared in serials. A first edition sold out almost instantly. Now Lorelei has countless descendents -- sure, those determined gals have been updated for the twenty-first century, with jobs and Web access. But light women's fiction could be seen to stem from Loos's novel.<br /><br />A satirical edge runs through \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,\\" poking fun at the jazzy gals whom Loos had to deal with regularly. Loos doesn't spare anything -- the book is riddled with intentional typos, like \\"encyclopediacs,\\" \\"safires\\" and \\"maskerades\\" (yet she can spell \\"champagne\\"). The shallowness of the flappers is best shown in straight-faced jokes about the latest Parisian styles of buttons. Loos's satire doesn't bite down to the bone, but it does scratch lightly in a deliciously catty way.<br /><br />Lorelei has an entertaining mix of determination, idiocy, and a constant belief in her own towering intellect. She's so much fun it's hard not to like her, in spite of the fact that she's an utter airhead. She talks matter-of-factly about how she has \\"almost one of everything\\" (diamond-wise), and tries to reform the entire world (without success, needless to say).<br /><br />Gentlemen may prefer blondes, and people seeking a fun light read may prefer \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\\" If you are in the mood for vintage chick-lit, Loos's witty little novel is a fun diversion.t to like her, in spite of the fact that she's an utter airhead.

But postmistress Mary \\"Harry\\" Haristeen (and her loyal pets Mrs. Murphy, Pewter and Tucker) suspect foul play. Was it really the wife? Or his mysterious girlfriend -- or a spurned ex-lover? When a second victim is found horribly killed, Harry and her fuzzy detectives set out to unravel the mystery...<br /><br />Rita Mae Brown's Mrs. Murphy mysteries aren't too taxing, especially with the love-it-or-hate-it gimmick of talking animals. They don't talk out loud, but they have long arguments and debates. The animals are a bit too cutesy at times, especially when Brown uses them to point out human absurdities, but newly-adopted puppy Brinkley is an adorable addition.<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Tail\\" is that it feels unfinished. While the mystery is dealt with nicely, the ending is too abrupt. And the whole matter of Harry and her ex-husband Fair's maybe-they-will-maybe-they-won't relationship is just left dangling. But Brown has a pleasant if undetailed way of writing. Except for a few dud lines (\\"Stop. Or I'll give you the third eye of prophecy!\\"), the dialogue tends to be funny and even cute. And Brown keeps it light with some funny scenarios, like the animals raiding a store of communion wafers.<br /><br />Harry mellows out a little in this book, although she seems no closer to deciding whether to get back together with her loving ex-husband Fair. She does grow up a little, accepting that the woman who broke up her marriage isn't pure evil (even if she is called \\"Boom Boom\\"). Fair is likable as the repentent ex who desperately wants to get back with Harry. But the other human characters are a bit two-dimensional, with a few exceptions like the friendly minister Herb.<br /><br />Amusing if vaguely unsatisfying, \\"Tail of the Tip-Off\\" is a pleasant mystery with a cutesy gimmick and a likable heroine.

But Neil Gaiman creates his own sparkling fairy tale in \\"Stardust,\\" an entrancing fantasy tale that never loses its magic. With beautiful prose, likable characters, and a mesh of the grotesque and the ethereal, this is a magnificent story.<br /><br />Years ago, Dunstan Thorn fell in love with a beautiful slave from across the Wall. Nine months later, he got a baby boy on his doorstep. His son Tristan grows up unaware of his heritage. He longs for the beautiful, frosty Victoria Forester, and when she rejects him, he makes a rash promise -- he'll pursue a fallen star over the Wall and bring it back to her, if she gives him her hand.<br /><br />But when he finds the star, he learns that it is a beautiful young girl, a daughter of the moon named Yvaine. The dying Lord of Stormheld threw a gem to the distance and accidently knocked her from the sky. Now his sons are trying to get the gem back, since the one who gets the gem will be the next Lord. What is more, an ancient witch is pursuing the star, determined to cut out her heart so she and her sisters can be young again. To protect the lovely star, Tristan is called on to be a hero, and to learn who he really is...<br /><br />Few fantasy stories are as well-done as \\"Stardust.\\" Gaiman mixes humor, romance, grisly realism and airy-fairiness in a tight little plot. It only really picks up two-thirds of the way into the book, but what a trip it is. It slides rather than explodes to a conclusion, where everything slips into place and all the loose ends are neatly tied together, in a way that makes perfect sense.<br /><br />His writing is a mix of beautiful details and fast-moving plot. Gaiman frequently pauses to describe the creepy Stormhelm, where murdered ghosts watch their brothers compete, to the beautiful forests of Faerie where little sprites mock people. Some scenes -- like a unicorn's skewering a witch -- are breathtakingly vivid.<br /><br />Everybody loves an everyman hero, and despite his mystery background, Tristan definitely qualifies. He's a little goofy and a lot clueless, but his earnestness makes him lovable. Yvaine is a bit off-kilter in a good way, sharp-tongued and a little naive, but a good match for Tristan. And supporting characters like the evil Septimus and youth-hungry witch are solidly written; even Victoria is shown in a new light.<br /><br />The beautiful adult fairy-tale \\"Stardust\\" is an entrancing read, wonderfully written and full of intriguing characters. An outstanding, timeless story, and sure to enchant fantasy readers.

He is Jeremy Duncan, the sullen star of the hit comic strip \\"Zits.\\" In the third treasury, \\"Zits Supersized,\\" Jeremy continues with the typical troubles of a teen -- clueless parents, a longing for freedom, hijinks with pal Hector, and a commitment-phobic girlfriend.<br /><br />Living in the suburbs with his orthodontist dad Walt and child-shrink mom Connie, Jeremy longs for the wild, dangerous life of a rock star. Unfortunately, he's mired in a relatively quiet life. But even if he's not a rocker, Jeremy has plenty of excitement in his life -- he makes the mistake of sleeping nude on the roof, starts calling his dad \\"Walt,\\" and gets a summer job digging koi ponds. If only he knew what a koi was.<br /><br />A new guy arrives at school -- Pierce, who lives up to his name by having several pounds of metal sticking through various body parts. Jeremy makes the mistake of having an all-night horror-movie marathon... while his parents are out of the house. And Jeremy has a bad breakup, then encounters a beautiful orthodontist's daughter at a convention, but he still can't forget Sara.<br /><br />Remember \\"Calvin and Hobbes,\\" which so aptly showed the inner thoughts of a six-year-old? Fast forward about nine years, and Calvin has transformed into Jeremy Duncan. (Hobbes has turned into a stocky Hispanic teenager) With the same sort of whimsical realism, \\"Zits\\" appeals to all age groups by spoofing both teens and parents at once.<br /><br />Jim Borgman and Jerry Scott (of \\"Baby Blues\\" fame) also add in the unedited \\"Good Night Dude\\" spoof of the classic kids' book. It's a few stanzas longer, with some wink-nudge naughty material (\\"And a picture of.../a girl with some big bazooms\\"). \\"Good night clutter/good night dust/good night week-old pizza crust!\\" Jeremy says joyously.<br /><br />Jeremy himself is the contradiction of a teenager -- he wants to be a bad boy, but is locked in the personality of a good boy. His long-suffering parents try desperately to understand him, which only drives him crazier. His high school is inhabited by an amusing array of freaks: the airhead patrol, the militant vegetarian, the gooey couple who never stop hugging, and the barb-tongued gossip.<br /><br />\\"Zits\\" has lost its initial freshness, but the fifth and sixth books in this treasury show that it's still solidly in its groove.

Formerly a short story in the \\"Legends\\" collection, \\"New Spring\\" is another dud for Robert Jordan, as he stretches a good novella into a ponderous, boring novel, which moves as fast as a brain-dead snail.<br /><br />It goes back in time a few decades, to when a very important fortune is told: a baby has been born, and this boy child may be the key to defeating the evil Dark One once and for all. But the Shadow is trying to kill the still-helpless Dragon Reborn, and so the good guys have to rescue him and keep him hidden away until he's old enough to fulfil his destiny.<br /><br />Moiraine Damodred is becoming a full-fledged Aes Sedai (sort of a female wizard), and Lan Mandragoran (Aragorn, anyone?) is the lost king of a lost kingdom. And together they will try to search for the Dragon Reborn and hide him away -- but their quest is not going to be that easy.<br /><br />Expanding short stories into novels is always a risky idea. For every \\"The Gunslinger,\\" you'll get ten novels like \\"New Spring\\" -- stretched-out to the breaking point. In its original form, \\"New Spring\\" was pleasantly written and well-paced, but Jordan fills it in with... well, filler. So we have too little plot and too much writing -- a lethal combination for any book.<br /><br />The writing itself would be nice if two-thirds of it were pared away. Unfortunately it's full of weird physical quirks (hair-pulling, straightening clothing) and facial expressions, or details about the rooms/furniture/dishes/random inanimate objects. And the actual content of the book takes place very late in the plot, with an obvious \\"to be continued\\" tacked on for more inevitable prequels.<br /><br />With a plot moving as fast as a glacier, Jordan has plenty of time to expand his characters -- but he doesn't. Moiraine was one of the most interesting characters of the Wheel of Time series, and it's good to see her \\"early years,\\" although it does take away from her mystique. Lan is good at brooding and doesn't have much more of a personality, and the Aes Sedai sniff and whine and snipe a lot.<br /><br />While Jordan's \\"New Spring\\" in its original form was a pleasant background read, the expanded novel is a bloated, sluglike mass of dull writing. Not recommended except to die-hard fans.to see her \\"early years,\\" although it does take away from her mystique.

Wodehouse -- and you will get what Carola Dunn clearly wanted for her debut mystery. Unfortunately, \\"Death At Wentwater Court\\" is too predictable and too easily unravelled, and the mysteries are solved with whimpers instead of bangs.<br /><br />Daisy Dalrymple -- in defiance of her class -- has taken on a job as a journalist. She arrives at Wentwater Court to do an extensive article on the Dalrymple house, but soon finds that there are potentially deadly secrets lurking there. Lady Wenwater has either a lover or a blackmailer, and her much-older husband is unaware of this. His daughter is infatuated with the blackmailer, and his sons either worship or hate his new wife.<br /><br />Then the blackmailing guest is found dead in an icy river, and almost everyone present had a motive for wanting him dead (not to mention his army of ex-lovers and their husbands). Daisy teams up with police detective Alec Fletcher to unearth who did the blackmailer in, and why. But soon Daisy learns that the crime is more complicated than she thought...<br /><br />\\"Death\\" is an extremely simple book -- it more or less goes from point A to point B without a lot of twists and turns. It has a fun, cozy atmosphere with a classic setting reminiscent of Christie and Sayers, but without the sizzly plot and dynamic twists that they were well known for. It's almost painfully easy.<br /><br />Dunn seems to chicken out about halfway through the book, as if she's afraid to make things too complex. Half the red herrings -- such as Lady Annabel's scandalous past, or her stepdaughter's darker side -- are built up as plot developments, only to be brushed aside with a \\"oh, is that it?\\" response. And what's the point of a murder mystery if the killer starts sobbing for no reason in front of the detective? However, she does handle the character relationships well, as well as the pleasantly earthy atmosphere of a country manor.<br /><br />Daisy herself isn't a terribly good character -- while she's refreshingly flawed and likable, she doesn't actually do much detecting. The other characters -- the stoic aristocrat, his neurotic kids, the tough cop -- are more or less stereotypes, pleasant but not memorable. Damsel-esque Lady Annabel in particular lacks a personality, and her blackmailer is all evil, all the time.<br /><br />Carola Dunn has a good sense of atmosphere and subtle interaction, but she strikes out in her first attempt at mystery writing. Here's hoping the rest of the Daisy Dalrymple series is far and above the pallid \\"Death in Wentwater Court,\\"<br /> <br />Daisy herself isn't a terribly good character -- while she's refreshingly flawed and likable, she doesn't actually do much detecting.

Robin Furth doesn't give us any new material, but fans and newcomers alike will probably want to check this out.<br /><br />Furth includes plenty of data on the first four novels of the series, starting with an essay that refreshes the reader's memory. Furth starts the actual content with a list of characters with biographical info, from \\"Abigail\\" to \\"Zoltan.\\" Then it's the areas of Mid-World, from the lair of the vampire nuns to Roland's long-lost homeland; the areas of our own world, and portals between the worlds.<br /><br />The appendices are also quite solid. The first explains in detail the various terms and phrases used in the High Speech, Mid-World language (\\"graf\\" is apple beer) and sayings (\\"If it's ka, it will come like the wind\\") and a bit of the Sisters of Eluria's language. The second appendix explains different drugs, languages, dances, holidays, instruments, and so on. The third explains various cultural figures and items from our own world, ranging from Humphrey Bogart to the Hobbit. The fourth and final appendix is a series of maps -- not too complex, but detailed enough.<br /><br />The Dark Tower series -- currently at six volume and a short story -- is enticingly complex and mysterious. It's also interlinked with other novels of King's, like \\"Insomnia\\" and \\"Eyes of the Dragon.\\" And so it's inevitable that even the die-hard fans will forget this character or that fair-day; with Furth's book, they can refresh their memories and maybe have a few points clarified.<br /><br />Furth does an excellent job organizing and annotating the book, including the books in which the items appear, and which pages are significant. She also maintains a calmly distant attitude in the book, without getting too gushy about King's work. But she does slip up occasionally; it's jarring to hear about \\"screwing\\" someone with a gun in a scholarly work.<br /><br />Robin Furth's \\"Dark Tower Concordance Volume 1\\" is a good accompaniment to the Dark Tower series, and even those who have read the series many times will want to keep it at hand. Very useful.someone with a gun in a scholarly work. <br /> <br />Robin Furth's \\"Dark Tower Concordance Volume 1\\" is a good accompaniment to the Dark Tower series, and even those who have read the series many times will want to keep it at hand.

Including &quot;Sister Light Sister Dark&quot; and &quot;White Jenna,&quot; this is a mythic-hero/coming-of-age tale with a twist -- the mythic hero is a strong girl.<br /><br /> &quot;Sister Light Sister Dark&quot; introduces Jenn, a baby girl orphaned three times: Her mother died in childbirth, the midwife died while taking her away, and the warrior woman who adopted her was also killed. She's taken in collectively by the followers of Great Alta, a benevolent goddess. But when the hame is threatened by war and death, Jenna learns of the prophecy of a white-haired child who will be their savior.<br /><br /> &quot;White Jenna&quot; picks up where &quot;Sister Light Sister Dark&quot; left off: Jenna is reluctantly accepting her fate as the legendary Anna. Now she and her two pals are trying to warn the other hames about evil Lord Kalas's attacks, and along the way they run into Carum, the prince whose life Jenna saved in the previous book. (Naturally, they have fallen in love) Now they are trying to raise followers to overthrow usurper, but will they be killed when they try?<br /><br /> Most stories of independent, amazonian tribes of women are unrealistic and dedicate their plots to tubthumping. Jane Yolen never falls into that trap. Her tale is both delicate and strong, with plenty of pseudo-medieval history nuggets, enticing fantasy and slam-bang battle scenes.<br /><br /> Yolen's writing is detailed and evocative, especially when she writes battle scenes. She also creates the whole religion and civilization around Great Alta very well. It seems like a medieval civilization that could actually have existed -- women who are farmers, hunters, warriors, priestesses, cooks, and anything else they need to be.<br /><br /> Most intriguingly, Yolen paints this fictional civilization in the Dales as real; she litters the text with scholarly reports, analysis of old legends about the Anna, and old folksongs from the Dales. At the same time, she injects some extra fantasy with the &quot;dark sisters,&quot; a sort of shadowy alter ego that Jenna and the other women have.<br /><br /> Jenna herself is a likable heroine. She doesn't seem to do quite as much as a chosen-one role might suggest. But Yolen's portrayal of a reluctant teen who doesn't see her own potential is excellent. Carum is a good love interest, never becoming too gooey and possessing strength and personality of his own. Most of the supporting characters are given their own quirks to make them interesting.<br /><br /> Want to read about a strong, intelligent mythic hero who happens to be a woman?

And something in the Russian city of Yaroslavl called out to Anna Fishbein, whose yearly visits to that place are chronicled in the quietly poignant &quot;On the Way Home.&quot;<br /><br /> In 1990, Anna Fishbein made her first visit to Yaroslavl, while doing photographic work on an indie movie. In the years since then, she has returned to photograph the people and places of Yaroslavl -- jaded children with cigarettes in their mouths, newlyweds standing quietly beside one another, workers and businessmen caught during quiet moments on leafy streets.<br /><br /> Looking at the photos of &quot;On the Way Home&quot; is like watching a sleeping giant slowly coming back to wakefulness. And not just in Yaroslavl either -- you get the feeling of timeless unity in her pictures, as if you could see these people anywhere in Russia, anywhere in time. Maybe even anywhere in the world, if that part of the world was slowly rising from its own ashes.<br /><br /> The simple black-and-white photos have a sort of solid, quiet appeal. They're a little too gritty to be really beautiful, but instead they have a sort of peace ingrained in each picture. The people in them tend to appear solemn and calm, usually thoughtful; they stand on leafy streets, in parks, hospitals, and other ordinary places. They quietly look at the camera, or at each other, without ever looking self-conscious.<br /><br /> Quiet and introspective, &quot;On the Way Home&quot; lets us have a peek at the people of Yaroslavl through Anna Fishbein's eyes. The latest of Perceval Press's excellent books is definitely worth a look.	2004-08-01

Tad Williams has that originality and talent in his richly-written &quot;Dragonbone Chair,&quot; but his glacial plot and prose could use some speeding up.<br /><br /> The High King Prester John is dying, and the land of Osten Ard is just waiting for the inevitable. Down in the kitchens, dreamy scullery boy Simon drifts through his work, and sometimes goes to the wizard Dr. Morgenes for lessons. But those visits allow Simon to see that not all is well: the new king Elias is weak-willed and petulant, and his advisor is the evil priest Pyrates.<br /><br /> When Simon learns that Elias has imprisoned his tormented brother Josua, and helps the prince to escape, he becomes a hunted man -- all the worse when his closest ally is killed. Desperately, Simon tries to find a sanctuary. But now Pyrates is resurrecting the evil Sithi monarch Storm King, and no one may be safe...<br /><br /> Tad Williams gives a lofty spin to the old favorites in his fantasy: smallish trolls (more like hobbits), elvish Sithi, a strong-willed princess, and a kitchen boy who blossoms into a hero. By mixing in some real civilizations like Vikins, and a parallel version of Christianity, he adds to the realistic flavor of his invented world. There are even references to the old Norse and Celtic religions, when someone refers to the old gods.<br /><br /> Williams has an undeniably lovely way of writing -- rich, detailed, and with a kind of medieval grandeur. Unfortunately it moves VERY slowly. It takes hundreds of pages for major events to happen, at which point Williams seems to realize that he needs to get moving, and hits the gas. We even get a detailed stagger-by-stagger description of Simon bumbling through some caves.<br /><br /> Simon is a bit immature and annoying at first, just as he should be. But his painful ascent to manhood is delicately handled by Williams. Dr. Morgenes is a pleasant spin on the wise-old-kindly-wizard type, and even minor characters like the Sitha Simon rescues are given individual personalities. The villains are a little less interesting, since Elias is a childish pain and Pyrates is pure evil.<br /><br /> Tad Williams' &quot;Dragonbone Chair&quot; is a richly-imagined, beautifully-written epic fantasy that leaves you wishing for more. If only Williams had pared down a couple hundred pages and gotten the plot moving faster.leasant spin on the wise-old-kindly-wizard type, and even minor characters like the Sitha Simon rescues are given individual personalities.

That is the question raised once you hear about &quot;Hole in the Sun,&quot; one of talented artist Viggo Mortensen's many books. Yes, it's photos. Of a swimming pool. And Mortensen's exceptional photographic skill makes it all come alive.<br /><br /> Mortensen displays different abstract photographs -- some color, and some black and white only -- in a sort of visual silence. At first he shows the quiet pool, undisturbed and photographed from many angles, even the reflections in the increasingly murky water. Then the pool is abandoned, and the wear and tear on it is revealed.<br /><br /> It's a surprisingly poignant book. There's no poetry, not much but the pictures. And without anything to distract the reader, Mortensen shows us the many facets of the pool. As it deteriorates, his pictures become sadder and lonelier-feeling, like watching a beautiful old statue falling into disrepair.<br /><br /> And Mortensen proves that yes, just about anything can be made interesting in the hands of a skilled photographer. He captures the eerie quality of cacti reflected in blue, and a little white butterfly drowned in the water. Some -- like the stark &quot;Blue 17,&quot; are so abstract that you can't tell what they are. His color photographs are startlingly vivid, so that readers can even see the splotches of green on the pool walls.<br /><br /> Painter/poet/actor/photographer Viggo Mortensen again proves his skill with a camera, in a book that shows that anything can make a good photo. Beautiful and skillful.	2004-07-28

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of &quot;Little Women&quot; come alive.<br /><br /> The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, &quot;poor little rich boy&quot; Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br /> The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br /> There's a clearly autobiographical tone to &quot;Little Women.&quot; Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- &quot;scribbling&quot; down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br /> Sure, usually classics are hard to read.

If the subject is already interesting, then Mortensen's photographs are outright fascinating. Mortensen's &quot;Miyelo&quot; is a photography book that is more than just a book, but an experience.<br /><br /> &quot;Miyelo&quot; is a collection of photographs focusing on the Lakota Ghost Dance, a recreation of a dance first performed in South Dakota in the late 1800s. Along with these photographs are more items related to the Ghost Dance -- Mortensen's own words, essays by experts of all stripes, chants, and quotations from everybody from Mark Twain to Crazy Horse to Lao-Tze.<br /><br /> &quot;Miyelo&quot; is one of those books that leaves you a bit dizzy after you've finished it. Mortensen shot the photographs for this book while filming the movie &quot;Hildago&quot; in the California desert. The result is surreal but extremely effective, almost like a vision of the past.<br /><br /> Mortensen's photography is never more entrancing than it is here. Just about every photo is shimmering and blurred, like a hallucination or a mirage. It gives the entire book the quality of a dream set on paper. &quot;Miyelo 15&quot; features a Lakota man standing in front of a shimmering desert landscape, while &quot;Miyelo 5&quot; shows only a series of transparent figures that seem to be moving. Living up to the name of the dance, these people look like ghosts.<br /><br /> Accompanying the photographs are Mortensen's foreword (which reads almost like poetry): &quot;After one of the dryest summers in memory, nearly all green had bled from the landscape, leaving cottonwood bark tatter and twig tip as grey as reflected dawn on the creek; pale as wrist scar, frost grass, clay cut bank and barely there clouds running for cover to the Black Hills.&quot;<br /><br /> But as wonderful as the essays and foreword are, it's Viggo Mortensen's dreamlike photography that makes this book truly unforgettable.

And here the fantasy master's &quot;Merlin Trilogy&quot; is brought together in one volume: the ethereal, beautifully-written fantasy stories &quot;Passager,&quot; &quot;Hobby,&quot; and &quot;Merlin.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Passager&quot; introduces us to a nameless, homeless boy who has been abandoned for sketchy reasons. The boy lives wild in the woods, but gradually rediscovers his human nature when he encounters a woodsman, who takes him in and gives him a name and a home...<br /><br /> &quot;Hobby&quot; opens with Merlin losing his new adoptive family in a fire. With no one to take care of him, he wanders through the woods again, calling himself Hawk. But then he suddenly encounters a vicious man called Fowler, who kidnaps him -- and not even taking refuge in the circus can keep him safe.<br /><br /> &quot;Merlin&quot; takes us to a different part of the Arthurian legend. Hunted by Fowler, he runs back into the woods and takes refuge there. Unfortunately, he is captured by a village of the wodewose, the wild people who live apart from civilization, and they want to harness his magical dreams. When the village is invaded, Merlin must try to keep himself alive -- and the little boy who will change his life forever.<br /><br /> Few authors can mix fantasy and history as Yane Yolen can, and she doesn't drop the ball in this. On the fantasy side, we have a boy of mysterious origins who dreams of the future; on the other hand, we have medieval lords and underlings, not to mention her skilful use of the wodewose.<br /><br /> These three very, very short novellas are lushly, dreamily written. And most intriguing of all, the first one is almost entirely in Merlin's own mind -- every little event or emotion is seen through the eyes of a wild boy. The second and third are more grounded, but they retain that vague mistiness and sweetness, like a half-remembered dream. Her writing is descriptive and almost sensuous.<br /><br /> Jane Yolen brings the preadolescent Merlin to life in the &quot;Merlin Trilogy,&quot; a magical and beautifully written trio of novellas.

Salinger's &quot;Catcher in the Rye,&quot; a dark-edged little novel about teen disaffection. Wry, cynical and strangely touching at times, this book is a look into the confusion and turmoil of a young mind.<br /><br /> Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from a prep school for failing almost every subject he was studying. And he couldn't care less -- after all, it's full of phonies. Over the weekend, Holden wanders the streets of New York, thinking about the school, the teachers, the phonies, and his nebulous family -- especially his brother Allie, who committed suicide.<br /><br /> Fearing the repercussions of going home and telling his parents what has happened, Holden just keeps touring New York in his peculiar cap. He meets a girl he once liked, a teacher who is sympathetic to his plight, but Holden always ends up pushing others away. And when he does go home, his temptation to run away is changed irrevocably.<br /><br /> Remember the disaffected anti-hero of &quot;Igby Goes Down,&quot; who flunks school over and over, and runs away to hang out in New York? Igby has Holden to thank for his existance. &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; catches teen dissatisfaction and dreams of freedom, making it seem almost painfully realistic.<br /><br /> Most classics don't include the anti-hero sputtering four-letter words on the first page. But Salinger's style for &quot;Catcher&quot; is an unusual one. Through Holden's eyes, it's a bitter and very straightforward style, peppered with wry observations. The biggest flaw would be the handling of Holden's own &quot;phoniness,&quot; since it's obvious he can be as phony as the people around him. It's subtle, but too subtle -- to less discerning readers, it seems like Holden is just a bitter hypocrite.<br /><br /> Holden Caulfield is a surprisingly nuanced character -- at first glance he just seems like an unusually obnoxious young boy who hates everything. But as the book unfolds, we see that he cares for genuine things, especially the innocence he no longer has. And he lacks the ability to connect with other people. None of the other characters really come to life... but they don't really need to. This is Holden's story.<br /><br /> &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a bitter pill to swallow, but it's definitely worth it. Disaffected, yearning and wry, this is a modern classic.But as the book unfolds, we see that he cares for genuine things, especially the innocence he no longer has.

So expect plenty of classic bombshell references in &quot;The Bombshell Manual to Style,&quot; an informative though rather thin description of how to let your inner sex kitten purr.<br /><br /> After a list of quotes from bombshells through the decades (does Drew Barrymore come off as bombshellish?), Stover starts giving intricate descriptions of how to live day to day as a bombshell. A bombshell's tantrums (brunettes get to destroy stemware), wardrobe (for weight-lifting, a triangle bikini and jeans), jewelry and &quot;underpinnings,&quot; perfumes, handbags (and their contents), shoes (mostly mules and slingbacks), makeup, a Bombshell's sanctum sanctorum (a piano is a must) and a soundtrack to her day (Tchaikovsky for bubble baths).<br /><br /> And, perhaps most importantly, attitude. &quot;If you can learn to use your mind as well as you use a powder puff, you will become more truly beautiful,&quot; Sophia Loren once said. So Stover also focuses on the attitude and feelings -- love of animals, optimism, laughter, and a bit of sentimentalism.<br /><br /> Don't take &quot;Manual&quot; as a complete guidebook to life unless you're a Paris Hilton heiress, since few women's lives can completely conform to what is described in here. Rather, take a tip here (perfume) or a tip there (shoes), if you're unsure of how to be feminine and sexy without seeming vampish. Certainly it has a lot of good pointers and recommendations.<br /><br /> Probably &quot;Manual&quot;'s big flaw is in being too restrictive. What if a Bombshell likes J.D. Salinger or Sylvia Plath -- is she disqualified? And the assumption runs through it that a Bombshell can afford the designer price tags and furnishings that are absolute musts for a bombshell. As Ms. Loren said, being a bombshell shouldn't be restricted by whether you wear Dior or not -- how about a Budget Bombshell book?<br /><br /> Laren Stover presents a fun and alluring vision of the classic bombshell beauty in &quot;Bombshell Manual of Style.&quot; Sure, you can't do it all, but you can at least put on some Manolos and spriz some Chanel on.hether you wear Dior or not -- how about a Budget Bombshell book? <br />  <br /> Laren Stover presents a fun and alluring vision of the classic bombshell beauty in &quot;Bombshell Manual of Style.&quot; Sure, you can't do it all, but you can at least put on some Manolos and spriz some Chanel on.	2004-07-26

But the Discworld series didn't start off on such good ground. In first Discworld novel &quot;The Colour of Magic,&quot; Pratchett lets his plot get away from him and meander over the edge of the Disc.<br /><br /> Discworld is a flat planet, balanced atop four elephants that stand on a giant turtle's back. And somewhere on that vast Disc is Rincewind the wizard -- cowardly, greedy, unlucky, a dropout and not very good at what he does. Enter Twoflower, a rather clueless tourist, and the Luggage, which walks around on hundreds of tiny legs.<br /><br /> Despite the fact that he doesn't want to, Rincewind is required to help the Discworld's first tourist ever (it's Twoflower, in case you're wondering). They're attacked by thieves, gamble with gods, encounter Death (who speaks ALL IN CAPITALS), and bumble through magical spells that can cause some major problems. But that isn't the biggest problem, when they encounter the very edge of the Disc...<br /><br /> &quot;Colour of Magic&quot; doesn't have much of a plot -- it basically has a long string of confusing, unhappy incidents that plague Rincewind, and it ends on an unsatisfying note. But at least the ride is fairly fun -- Pratchett spoofs the fantasy cliches with wink-nudge fervor.<br /><br /> Pratchett peppers his satirical little novel with lots of fun ideas, such as the quirky gods of Discworld and the dragon that vanishes if you stop believing in it. Unfortunately, the dialogue and writing aren't quite up to par. At times it's the delicious tone of British comedy, and sometimes it's so serious that it seems like Pratchett is writing an entirely different novel.<br /><br /> Rincewind isn't a very engaging character in this volume -- we laugh at him, not with him. His constant efforts to keep himself alive are especially funny, since his luck is a mixture of bad (he always gets into trouble) and good (he always gets out of it). Twoflower is an amusing character, but the Luggage steals the show despite not being able to speak.<br /><br /> Fans of comic fantasy might enjoy &quot;Colour of Magic,&quot; but it's by far the weakest of Pratchett's many Discworld books.

With two recent Dark Tower releases and a forthcoming grand finale, fans of Stephen King's dark fantasy series may want to brush up on the first four volumes of the series. &quot;The Gunslinger,&quot; &quot;the Drawing of the Three,&quot; &quot;The Waste Lands&quot; and &quot;Wizard's Glass&quot; all have their individual flaws, but the overall effect is excellent.<br /><br /> &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; introduces us to Roland Deschain of Gilead, the last gunslinger of a long-dead land. The hardened cowboy/knight wanders through a wasted world, tracking a &quot;man in black&quot; who can help him find (cue ominous music) the Dark Tower. Along the way he finds Jake, a young boy who was killed in a car accident in our world. But in the name of his quest, Roland may be called on to sacrifice what he loves...<br /><br /> &quot;The Drawing of the Three&quot; kicks off mere hours after &quot;Gunslinger&quot; ends. Roland is sick, and being pursued by carnivorous &quot;lobstrosities.&quot; But then he ends up transporting his mind into our world -- specifically, into the minds of junkie smuggler Eddie Dean, and legless civil rights activist Odetta Holmes (and her evil alter ego, Detta). Roland &quot;draws&quot; these two into his own world, but Eddie's withdrawal and Detta's malevolence might kill his quest before it even starts.<br /><br /> &quot;The Waste Lands&quot; begins with Roland tutoring Susannah (formerly Odetta/Detta) and Eddie in how to be gunslingers. But while the newlyweds are rapidly getting the hang of it, Roland is not doing well. Because of a paradox he created when he saved the boy Jake, his mind is starting to deteriorate. In Manhattan, Jake is suffering from the same thing. To save them both from madness, the gang draws Jake away from our world. But no sooner has he joined them than they come to a ruined city, with an insane mono train and a sinister figure following them...<br /><br /> &quot;Wizard's Glass&quot; opens with the gang (or ka-tet) riddling desperately against an insane train, which is on a suicide run. Eddie barely manages to defeat it with a bunch of stupid jokes, and the ka-tet continues their journey. Along the way, Roland tells them the story of his first love Susan Delgado, a beautiful girl who was promised to a dirty old man, and how he lost her when he was only fourteen. And the story is linked to what is ahead -- a person from Roland's past awaits them, along with the hard-won Wizard's Glass that destroyed Roland's family.<br /><br /> Stephen King is best known for being a horror writer, covering everything from evil cars to telekinetic high-schoolers. But &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; is a gritty fantasy with a few horror elements in it, and though it has some grotesque images, it's more fantastical than icky. Not to mention that it has homages sprinkled through it to &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; the &quot;Childe Roland&quot; story, &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; and even King's own books.<br /><br /> King's writing is full of slam-bang action, even if it doesn't excel in the technical sense. And the gunslinger is an excellent lead character, a mixture of rock-hard determination and affection for his friends. Eddie comes across as rather annoying at times, but he's evidently supposed to; on the other hand, Susannah is remarkably complex with her double personality. And Jake serves as a surrogate son for Roland, while displaying his own brand of eleven-year-old toughness.<br /><br /> As the release date for &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; approaches, fans may want to brush up on this epic series, and newbies may want to find out more about it.

Yuta recognizes the man -- Shingo, a rich young psycho who died with his sister Akiko long ago. But actually, they ate mermaid's flesh with differing effects. Now Shingo is immortal, and Akiko is still alive, trapped in a living doll's body. Now Shingo is trying to find and kill his sister -- because so long as she is alive, he is pursued by a horrifying vision...<br /><br /> In &quot;Mermaid's Mask,&quot; Yuta and Mana come across a little boy called Nanao who escaped from a moving car. When Nanao takes some &quot;medicine,&quot; his scrapes instantly heal, and the immortal pair suspect that he's like them. But the real truth comes to mind when they learn that the boy's mother has kidnapped him from her own son -- and that because of the mermaid's flesh, she can tear off her own scarred face and replace it with another...<br /><br /> Don't expect humor and lightness in Takahashi's Mermaid Saga. There's the occasional moment of dry humor, like Mana constantly referring to Nanao as &quot;squirt.&quot; But overall it's even more violent and gruesome than the other Mermaid stories, such as when Nanao's &quot;mother&quot; skins her own face, though Takahashi keeps it tastefully shadowed.<br /><br /> Mana and Yuta have changed a little over the course of the series -- Yuta is a little happier and less haunted, and Mana has become less clueless. They mesh well together, although they are not explored quite as much in this volume as in the previous two. And supporting characters -- like the insanely possessive mother, or the evil Shingo -- are chillingly well-drawn.<br /><br /> Things get nasty and bloody in the third excellent volume of Takahashi's Mermaid Saga. &quot;Mermaid's Gaze&quot; is a good horror-fantasy read -- just don't read it after dark.br /> Things get nasty and bloody in the third excellent volume of Takahashi's Mermaid Saga. &quot;Mermaid's Gaze&quot; is a good horror-fantasy read -- just don't read it after dark.	2004-07-22

Katherine Langrish's debut novel has a few dropped threads, but dips into traditional goblins and ghouls as its inspirations. And it's inspired indeed.<br />Peer's father has died, just after completing a new longship. Enter Baldur, his ogrish uncle, who takes all of Peer's money and drags him and his faithful dog away. Peer's new home is a miserable place, in a land surrounded by angry neighbors and mischief-making trolls. He's treated like a slave by his uncles Baldur and Grim, and his only solace is the Nis (a neglected house sprite) and a girl from the neighboring farm, Hilde.<br />But things take a nastier turn after Peer encounters the ghoulish Granny Green-teeth: She reveals that at a forthcoming double wedding for troll princes and princesses, the uncles are going to give him as a wedding present. What's worse, they also plan to kidnap Hilde and give HER as a gift too. Determined to save himself, Peer runs away from home -- only to end up right in the trolls' hands...<br />&quot;Troll Fell&quot; is a good example of what a fantasy should be -- not derivative, well-written, quick-faced and with enough quirks to keep it from being too grim. Langrish doesn't stoop to deus ex machinae, but keeps the plot simple and straightforward, while peppering it with plenty of northern ghoulies, ghosties and long-legged beasties.<br />Her writing is solid and descriptive, bringing to life everything from the bleak hills to the bizarre underground kingdom of the trolls. Langrish is particularly good at making the readers feel what the characters are feeling, such as Peer's almost crippling claustrophobia, or his horror at seeing faithful dog Loki thrown into a dogfight. A few threads -- such as Granny's threat to Peer -- are left unsatisfied, but a sequel might take care of those.<br />Peer and Hilde are a good hero and heroine, with their own flaws and squabbles and weaknesses. The supporting cast is equally good -- the scraggly, disgruntled Nis, the stupid lubbers, the grandmotherly yet homicidal pond-dweller Granny Greenteeth, feisty grandpa Eirek, and the greedy, scheming Baldur and Grim.<br />&quot;Troll Fell&quot; lives up to its promise as a suspenseful, well-written fantasy.

Now that the quest is underway, King's world of cyborg bears, insane trains and sex-addict demons coalesces into a tight, engrossing story.<br />Newlyweds Susannah (formerly Odetta/Detta) and Eddie Dean are rapidly becoming expert gunslingers, even proving themselves as Susannah guns down cyborg bear Shardik, and Eddie takes out robots. But Roland is having problems. Since he saved the life of eleven-year-old Jake in the previous book, he remembers two realities -- one where he saved Jake, and one where he let him die. Now that paradox is slowly driving him insane -- and worse, in his own world, Jake is also going mad.<br />They find a doorway to Jake's world, but it's guarded by a malevolent demon. Susannah manages to trap the demon (by having sex with it) as Eddie barely manages to draw Jake into Mid-World. Now they are a &quot;ka-tet,&quot; or a group brought together by destiny. But the ka-tet has barely formed before it's threatened, by a mysterious figure that is following them at a distance -- and an insane train that traps them on its suicide run....<br />In &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; and &quot;Drawing of the Three,&quot; King spent his time establishing the main quest and the lead characters. Now he's got those in the bag, and the story revs up as Roland and Co. set off to find the Dark Tower rather than just talking about it. It feels like the series had finally hit its stride.<br />The world that has &quot;moved on&quot; is not a nice place -- just about everything is dangerous, bleak or at least rough-edged. But King manages to keep the weirder elements --  like the cyborg animals or the riddling train -- from seeming silly. His writing is not usually good in the technical sense, but it excels at having atmosphere and lots of gruesome slam-bang action.<br />Roland remains the rough cowboy with a hidden heart of gold and a tragic past. His bond with lonely Jake is a particularly touching detail. Eddie becomes a bit annoying at times with all his wisecracking, but he has a past almost as hard as Roland's. Susannah is perhaps the most interesting of all -- two opposing personalities merged into one.

But she starts into a downward spiral when she first dates a sexy photographer who turns into a psychologically abusive Mr. Hyde, an Italian prince who turns out to be married, and then a married guy whose wife threatens her job. Can she find happiness, and a guy who doesn't possess (much) of a deep dark secret?<br />At first, &quot;Bergdorf Blondes&quot; seems like light fun, full of freebie designer wear and beautiful people with little, if anything to do. Sykes strains to make some kind of witty statement about &quot;champagne bubble&quot; socialites, but even she doesn't seem to have a clue what her exact statement is. In theory, it's a satire. But aren't satires supposed to be witty?<br />Sykes does seem to be aware that her plot -- rich girls search for fiancees and clothes -- is thin and insubstantial. So she tries to shore it up with constant name-dropping (does Versace even make tissues?) and cutesy slang. It's fun for about forty pages, but then it just gets boring and increasingly irritating. Even the sex talk is cutesy -- enough with the lead character talking about &quot;going to Brazil&quot; (having sex) and &quot;finding Rio&quot; (I think you can figure that one out). At the end, in her eagerness for everybody to be happy, she even has Julie  Bergdorf conveniently forget that the lead slept with her boyfriend.<br />Sykes would have readers believe that her protagonist was capable of getting into Princeton on intellectual merit-- extremely doubtful, considering what Princeton is like. Her characters are almost offensively air-headed. Sykes would also have you believe that her narrator is less dizzy than her friends (good Lord, she uses the word &quot;inverse!&quot;), but if anything she's even more idiotic. She achieves a happily-ever-after purely by cosmic chance. And the other characters, from her rabid Angophile mum to her psychologically abusive boyfriend, are basically walking cardboard cutouts.<br />Had Plum Sykes written a biting satire or a fun little bit of uptown fluff, &quot;Bergdorf Blondes&quot; might have been an entertaining light read. Instead she tries to do both at once, and achieves neither. Boring, precious and shallow -- much like her characters.ess for everybody to be happy, she even has Julie  Bergdorf conveniently forget that the lead slept with her boyfriend.<br />Sykes would have readers believe that her protagonist was capable of getting into Princeton on intellectual merit-- extremely doubtful, considering what Princeton is like.

Sick and possibly dying, he stumbles away and collapses. But he still has to find and &quot;draw&quot; two people to assist him in his quest for the Dark Tower. He finds a door that leads him into our world, and inside the head of Eddie Dean, a young junkie/drug smuggler. Eddie reluctantly allows Roland's voice to guide him, as his beloved brother is murdered and his drug deal self-destructs.<br />As Eddie goes cold turkey, Roland starts to pursue the second person: Odetta Holmes, a beautiful African-American civil-rights activist, who lost her legs when someone pushed her off a train platform. She is also schizophrenic -- she has a second personality, the foul-mouthed, psychotic Detta. Now Roland and Eddie are stuck with a woman who can turn into a malevolent killer at any moment. And now Roland pursues Jack Mort -- and runs into a familiar face from his past.<br />&quot;The Drawing of the Three&quot; is almost very good, but not quite. Unlike &quot;The Gunslinger,&quot; this is pretty obviously a bridge between the first and third books, setting up the scene for the rest of the series. So it's rather awkward at times, as King tries to write a story around his formative characters. In that, he does a pretty good job.<br />King's writing is not technically very good, but it has an evocative slam-bang quality -- the lobstrosities, the doors, the airplane, the blistering postapocalyptic world that Roland lives in. The descriptions comes alive with vibrant intensity. But he doesn't seem to be at ease with the constant, sprawling flashbacks to Eddie and Odetta/Detta's past lives, which add a weirdly fragmented quality to the book. It's easy to lose track of the action.<br />Enigmatic gunslinger Roland doesn't get much fleshing out in this book -- it's all about Eddie and Odetta/Detta. King brings their struggles and feelings up in all their beauty and ugliness, showing Eddie's love for the brother who led him astray. Odetta/Detta is particularly interesting: One personality is a cultured, refined heiress, and the other is a murderous, racist psycho.<br />King stumbles over his fragmented narrative at times, but &quot;Drawing of the Three&quot; is a good follow-up to &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; and sets the stage for the remainder of the Dark Tower series.to Eddie and Odetta/Detta's past lives, which add a weirdly fragmented quality to the book.

While &quot;The Magic Lantern: An Autobiography&quot; is prettily written and lets you see a little of Bergman's persona, he wrote with little detail and few interesting anecdotes.<br />Bergman covers his childhood at a Lutheran parsonage in Sweden, and his early fascination with the mechanics of filmmaking -- the &quot;magic lantern.&quot; He describes his failures and successes, his marriages, his love affair with muse Liv Ullman, and the many now-legendary figures that he dealt with in his illustrious career.<br />Ingmar Bergman creates atmospheric, riveting films full of emotion... which is the exact opposite of &quot;The Magic Lantern.&quot; It's heavy in uninteresting details and bits of information -- Bergman lectures at length about Swedish taxes, but doesn't tell us about his feelings or his motivation.<br />And while people who write autobiographies are entitled to keep parts of their lives private, Bergman's lack of emotion carries over to his family. He barely mentions Ullman, and only includes one emotionless anecdote about their love affair. Their daughter Linn isn't mentioned at all. For that matter, none of his kids or wives are given much attention.<br />If one slogs through the swamp of boring details, there are a handful of interesting stories, involving people like Charlie Chaplin, Ingrid Bergman and Greta Garbo. But Bergman seems to be half asleep. There's little humor, pathos or anger in his writing -- it's flat. There's something wrong with a book when the most passionate anecdote is about Bergman and a cinematograph. It's no coincidence that Bergman calls this book &quot;The Magic Lantern&quot; -- filmmaking seems to be the only passion he can describe.<br />Ingmar Bergman is an excellent director, but as a writer he leaves something to be desired. &quot;The Magic Lantern: An Autobiography&quot; comes across as a distasteful duty he didn't pay much attention to, rather than a look into his mind and life. Dull and ponderous.idn't pay much attention to, rather than a look into his mind and life. Dull and ponderous.	2004-07-12

But then Jessup and Emily Volnik return to Scotland, and clue in the castle's relieved owner as to the nature of the family Boggart -- harmless, but loves mischief. But a trip to Loch Ness starts to mess things up -- Jessup and Emily encounter an investigator, working for an eccentric millionaire, who is trying to find the legendary Nessie.<br />The problem is, the Loch Ness monster is actually a boggart, who sank into depression and sleep after his castle was destroyed. Despite the urgings of the Boggart, Nessie can't change form for very long -- he keeps popping back into his monster form. Now the Boggart and his friends must tackle the best of modern technology, to keep Nessie hidden.<br />Like most sequels, it's best to read &quot;The Boggart&quot; before tackling &quot;The Boggart and the Monster.&quot; But don't expect a stale rehash. Cooper gives her story about boggarts a new twist with the Loch Ness monster. What's more, she manages to weave in the legend of Nessie, without making it feel like a cash-in-on-a-mystery-creature book.<br />The story goes at a more breakneck pace than the first book, and at times it's easy to lose track of it. But Cooper's writing is vivid and compelling, bringing the lakes, hills and ruined castles of Scotland to life. And she gets into the heads of the boggarts wonderfully -- Nessie's loneliness and depression, and the Boggart's desperation and giddy enjoyment.<br />Jessup and Emily are nice heroes, not exceptional but well-drawn and likable. The Boggart himself is the scene-stealer -- one minute he'll be cheerleading Nessie, then pulling dog's tails, and making an ROV explorer do an underwater dance. And Nessie is a nice addition, a rather pitiful boggart who has lost his knack for boggartry.<br />Susan Cooper serves up a solid sequel in &quot;The Boggart and the Monster,&quot; returning to the world of Celtic sprites and spirits. Fun and enjoyable.then pulling dog's tails, and making an ROV explorer do an underwater dance.

Sexy immortals with angst to spare are the cornerstones of Anne Rice's fiction.  &quot;The Mummy or Ramses the Damned&quot; takes a different direction, mixing romance with horror and supernatural thrills. It has its flaws, but the raw energy of the book keeps it roaring up to the finale.<br />Lawrence Stratford uncovers the mummy of Ramses the Second, or &quot;Ramses the Damned.&quot; But before he can unravel the mysteries around the mummy, he's murdered by his amoral nephew Henry, and the mummy is shipped to England. Lawrence's daughter Julie takes possession both of the family fortune and the mummy -- only to have the mummy revive when exposed to sunlight, and try to kill the murderous Henry. He's Ramses, an Egyptian king who drank an elixir of eternal life taken from a Hittite priestess.<br />Long ago, he faked his own death and wandered the world, eventually returning to Egypt and becoming the mentor/lover of the legendary Cleopatra -- only to lose her first to Antony, then to death. At first, Ramses is thrilled by the early-twentieth-century England, and he and Julie start to fall in love. But on a trip to Egypt, he comes across the mummy of Cleopatra, and revives her with a vial of the elixir. Except that this Cleopatra is mad, murderous, torn by her old loves and hates -- and unkillable.<br />This is not your parents' &quot;Mummy&quot; story. Except for one mildly funny scene where Rameses first revives, there are no stumbling mummies covered in bandages. Instead we have a tortured immortal who wakes up into a new world, while still being rooted in the Egypt of three thousand years ago.<br />Rice's lush prose is well-suited to the splendor of early twentieth-century England, when Egyptology was the fad -- she has lots of fun with the lace, pearl buttons, and opera houses. Her most awkward points are when Rameses is marveling at/criticizing 1914 England. At the same time, she gives new twists to the tale of the mummy, such as having him romance Cleopatra.<br />Ramses gives a slightly new twist to the tormented, lonely immortal, by having his almost childlike response to things like faucets and shoes. Julie falls for him a bit too quickly (yes, he's gorgeous, but what else?), but a good love interest. The other characters -- the youth-craving Elliott, his clueless but sweet son Alex, and the money-hungry, evil Henry -- are all intriguing and fully explored. But Cleopatra is what makes the book -- she's seductive but mad, tormented but still loving. Dislike her, but Rice will make you pity her too.<br />&quot;The Mummy or Ramses the Damned&quot; gives new twists to the story of a mummy come to life. Rather than an undercooked horror novel, Rice gives a thrilling, chilling look at immortality, and how what you want is not what you get.br />Ramses gives a slightly new twist to the tormented, lonely immortal, by having his almost childlike response to things like faucets and shoes.

Parker takes readers back in time with her debut novel, &quot;Rashomon Gate,&quot; a tightly-wound mystery taking place in 11th-century Japan. With likable characters and plenty of different plot threads, Parker does an excellent job of making Heian-era Japan come alive.<br />Minor bureaucrat Sugawara Akitada gets a request from his former teacher/foster father, Professor Hirata. Hirata reveals that someone in the university faculty is blackmailing someone else. So Akitada takes a job as a teacher at the university, and begins to investigate the possible motives and criminals. But then a body shows up -- a young pregnant girl with ties to people at the university.<br />Soon Akitada uncovers a sinister web of corruption, blackmail, and suicide from the year before. Then another body shows up -- an antisocial poetry professor, whose half-naked body is hung from a statue of Confucius. Now Akitada must sort out different crimes -- the dead professor, the pregnant girl, and a vanished elderly prince -- but finds that he may be the next victim...<br />Parker's debut is a polished one -- she manages to juggle a bunch of interconnected plot threads without dropping any of them. And without being too obvious about it, she gives a strong feel for the culture, hierarchies, complexity and accomplishments of Heian-era Japan.<br />Parker's writing is solid and descriptive, with some light moments sprinkled through the book. Her dialogue is a bit too &quot;modern American,&quot; but not so much that it makes the book seem unrealistic. She includes some humor from sidekick Tora and his fact-finding missions (which usually involve lots of booze), and a bit of romance when Akitada desperately tries to woo Hirata's beautiful daughter.<br />Akitada is the model of a nice guy; while not perfect, he tries to do the right thing, and has plenty of brainpower to back it up. Tora is a good sidekick, a bandit-turned-valet/handyman/snoop who likes women, wine, and making kites with little princes. The supporting cast is well-drawn and likable, from the grandfatherly Hirata to imperious little prince Minamoto to the rough but kindly outcasts that Tora befriends.<br />&quot;Rashomon Gate&quot; is a solid, well-written mystery with humor, romance, and likable characters.

Unfortunately. J.E.A. Taylor's &quot;Complete Tolkien Companion&quot; is far from invaluable. With barely any details and seriously unbalanced data, Taylor's book is all right as a second or third choice, but a flop as a serious guide.<br />From A (&quot;Accursed Years&quot;) to Z (&quot;Zirak-Zigil&quot;), this book covers people, places, battles, objects and events from all throughout Middle-Earth's history. Taylor includes information from Tolkien's famous &quot;Hobbit&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; as well as the Silmarillion, &quot;Unfinished Tales,&quot; and some other books. (Unfortunately, he doesn't include all of the history books)<br />Is &quot;The Complete Tolkien Companion&quot; worthless as an encyclopedia? No, not at all -- it's useful for some quick glances, and Taylor has a pleasant if clumsy style. But as a serious source, it fails. It doesn't have enough informaton, and what it does have is unbalanced and weirdly conveyed.<br />One of the most annoying things is that while Tyler will tell some stuff about various characters, events, and items. But in most entries, he doesn't specify which books they appeared in, what pages, or much else. Where is &quot;Khuzdul&quot; revealed to be a secret language? He doesn't tell you. And his handling of the information is clumsy: readers are told that Arwen Evenstar shares the &quot;Doom of Luthien.&quot; What does Luthien have to do with her descendent becoming a mortal? Taylor doesn't say.<br />What's more, Taylor demonstrates a weird tendency to act like the events of Tolkien's books are a 10,000-year-old history. He claims in his preciously-worded foreword that he's going to stop, but he doesn't -- a tendency that crosses the line from fervently geeky to unsettling. What is more, he has a tendency to interject his own opinions into the text: he spends a long time explaining how misunderstood Galadriel is, for example.<br />To casual fans, &quot;The Complete Tolkien Companion&quot; might have some worth. But for those seeking more information about Tolkien's Middle-Earth, this is an unworthy choice, in the shadow of Robert Foster's accomplished &quot;Complete Guide to Middle-Earth.&quot;example.<br />To casual fans, &quot;The Complete Tolkien Companion&quot; might have some worth.

It's an intriguing read, with plenty of interesting details about a unique life, but somehow Rossellini never quite bares her soul.<br />Rosselini writes about her childhood in Italy, with movie icon Ingrid Bergman as a mother, and revolutionary filmmaker Roberto Rossellini as a father. She reluctantly entered acting -- and almost stopped forever when her first film was a flop -- and became a Lancôme cosmetics model, only to be fired for her age. She tells of her son's adoption, her battle with scoliosis, her failed marriage to Martin Scorsese, and the background of her vast mixed family.<br />&quot;Some of Me&quot; is less like an autobiography than snapshots of Rossellini's life. It's non-linear, darting from adulthood to childhood to adolescence with no order. She doesn't explain much about her husbands and lovers, but explains plenty about the wet nurse who cared for her and her twin sister as babies.<br />Rossellini gives the feeling of being at peace with the world -- she's gotten past her initial heartbreaks and problems. Some strong emotions -- grief at her mother's loss, anger at Lancôme's attitude towards her -- seep through. But Rossellini never really bares her deeper emotions or her soul. This book is like having a deep conversation with her: you will hear about her life, but won't be able to really get down and deep.<br />Despite that, Rosselini has a bright style, full of melancholy and humor. She relates conversations with her now-dead parents, talks about pelting the paparazzi with rocks, and Audrey Hepburn's dirty fingernails. She lets readers see another side of Ingrid Bergman -- a loving neat-freak, who calmly tells her daughter that she's acquainted with the F-word.<br />&quot;Some of Me&quot; is an apt title -- it gives us part of the picture, and leaves you feeling that parts of it are still hidden.

Tolkien's Gandalf -- Merlin, the magical wise man who mentored the legendary King Arthur. In the Merlin Trilogy, Mary Stewart presents her fantastical but realistic portrayal of Arthurian legend -- it's engrossing and hauntingly written, and has become a classic of the fantasy genre.<br />&quot;The Crystal Cave&quot; tells of a young boy in Wales, a king's bastard grandson who is constantly treated with suspicion. But Merlin learns that he is no ordinary boy -- he has ancient powers at his command. And as he travels across the land, Merlin sets into motion events that will lead to the birth of Arthur, the future king of Britain.<br />&quot;The Hollow Hills&quot; take us to ahead in time. Merlin is guardian of Arthur, a boy who has no idea that he's going to be king -- or any of the other things that await him. Eventually, Merlin takes him to learn of his true identity, and Arthur begins to establish himself as a strong young king. But his malevolent half-sister Morgause does something that may destroy Arthur and Merlin as well...<br />&quot;The Last Enchantment&quot; takes us to the end of Merlin's long life, as he sees Arthur rise in power. But Arthur is threatened by his evil half-sister Morgause, and the child they conceived during an incestuous night together (Arthur didn't know she was his sister). Merlin watches as the end of Arthur's kingdom begins, as he falls in love and watches his pupil/lover Nimue take his place.<br />Merlin has been reinvented countless times, ranging from a confused little boy to a Druid holy man to a deranged lech. Mary Stewart's is a unique vision, only rivalled by T.A. Barron's Merlin -- her Merlin is entirely human and sympathetic, but endowed with mystical, earthy powers that seem like something out of an old Celtic legend.<br />Stewart's writing goes at a slow burn. Nothing happens quickly; even battle scenes are sort of distantly written. This can get a little dull at times, but her slow style is perfectly suited for the intricate, engaging relationships between the characters. And she has a flair for suspense, building up a sense of doom over Arthur's entire life.<br />Merlin is not a distant sage or a weird old man here. Instead he's an ordinary person who becomes an extraordinary one, with doubts and weaknesses like anyone else. Arthur and the other supporting characters aren't quite as interesting. They're only seen through Merlin's eyes, so they fail to be quite as three-dimensional.<br />Mary Stewart wrote many novels, but none have proved as popular or as striking as the Merlin Trilogy, and the sequel &quot;The Wicked Day.&quot; Engaging, spellbinding and beautifully written.ut her slow style is perfectly suited for the intricate, engaging relationships between the characters.

This raw dark fantasy seriesstarts off in &quot;The Gunslinger,&quot; a fragmented but compelling story of the last gunslinger, Roland.<br />As the story opens, the last gunslinger Roland is travelling across a world that has &quot;moved on.&quot; He's hunting a mysterious man in black, who holds the key to a secret Roland has been hunting for his entire life. He stops in a town full of druggies and religious fanatics, only to leave it partly ruined -- and still in pursuit of the man in black.<br />But a part of our own world enters: Jake, a young boy who was killed in a horrible traffic accident. The gunslinger takes Jake under his wing, and along on his quest. Together they cross horrors and dangers -- until they find the Man in Black, and the doom that waits for Jake a second time. All for the sake of finding one thing: The Dark Tower, the linchpin of the universe.<br />&quot;Gunslinger&quot; is only a small sliver of the vast story that the Dark Tower series has become, and it's also the most fragmented. For a long time the story-line meanders from one ominous thing to another, speckled with Roland's reminiscences about his not-so-pleasant childhood. Things only become earth-shaking in the last part of the book, where Roland catches up to the Man in Black.<br />The world King creates is a nasty, desert-like place, part medieval, part postapocalyptic horror, and part old west. Sex, drugs, rock'n'roll (&quot;Hey Jude&quot;), religion and long-ago politics are mixed in with the basic quest. King's writing is detailed, raw and vivid, with plenty of shoot-'em-up action, succubi and mutated monsters to keep readers on their toes.<br />The Gunslinger is like a dark fantasy version of those gritty P.I.s that Humphrey Bogart sometimes played. He's rough, tough, dark, he doesn't reveal much of his feelings, but he has the occasional soft spot, and his hidden feelings seep out rather than being obvious. Jake is a good sidekick, kind of naive, and completely clueless about this strange world he's been hurled into.<br />&quot;The Gunslinger&quot; is perhaps the weakest of King's Dark Tower books, but the ending hints at the future outstanding developments.

Now he takes his love of horses one step further. In &quot;The Horse is Good,&quot; Mortensen presents his unique vision of horses from across the world, from a perspective that isn't entirely human.<br />Mortensen presents a sort of ethereal photographic exercise, showing all sorts of horse photographs. Some are sharp black-and-white shots, and some are colorful. Some are blurred, and some take awhile to figure out where the horse is in the photo. And some are distant and obscured by weather conditions, like a the final shot in a depressing movie finale.<br />Mortensen took his photographs all across the world, presenting us with photos from Morocco, South Dakota, Montana, New Zealand, Denmark, Brazil, Iceland, California, and Argentina. Surprisingly, he keeps the perspective fresh -- you don't get sick of page after page of horses. You're more likely to be struck by the quiet, earthy beauty captured in each image, all different.<br />And Mortensen's photography itself is pretty varied -- there's color and stark black-and-white photos, with some bright and blurry and some sharply focused. The shots themselves vary in a technical sense. Mortensen took some photographs from the rider's point of view (never has the back of a horse's ears looked so interesting), and others from the horse's point of view, down below where photographs are usually shot. That unusual technique makes the photos seem less like a simple photo, and more like a split second through a horse or lonely rider's own eyes.<br />Viggo Mortensen's love of horses shines through brightly in &quot;The Horse is Good,&quot; a simple, beautiful study of one of mankind's oldest companions. Quiet and very lovely.	2004-07-01

But being an assistant is in a class of its own.&quot; That comment sets the tone of Robin Lynn Williams' &quot;The Assistants.&quot; This witty little novel is a wickedly funny look at the spiderweb known as Hollywood, and an ode to overworked personal assistants everywhere.<br />The assistants are: Michaela, willing to sleep her way to the top. Griffin, a frustrated manager who pretends to be gay. Kecia, trying to deal with partyboy actor Travis, and imminent IRS doom. Jeb, madly in love with his boss's wife. And Rachel, a sweet small-town girl who is new to Hollywood. They deal with all the same people -- treacherous managers, aging divas, brainless heartthrobs, and yes, other disgruntled personal assistants.<br />As if things weren't hard enough, they encounter some brand-new problems. Kecia, Michaela and Jeb are unceremoniously fired. Rachel finds herself babysitting an aging sitcom star, who is claiming she has a terminal illness. And Griffin is going crazy trying to deal with Travis' murderous ex-con brother. Finally, the personal assistants have had enough of their borderline abusive bosses -- they've sacrificed their morals, their dignity, and now they're going to fight back.<br />Apparently working for a year as a personal assistant can scar you for life. At least, that's the impression one gets from &quot;Assistants.&quot; There's plenty of name-dropping, everyone current from Keira Knightley to Luciano Pavarotti, and even the &quot;Friends&quot; finale. But it's a look at Hollywood that's stripped of the glamour, leaving just the shallow glitz.<br />Williams clearly has a wickedly barbed sense of humor. She spoofs the mindless blockbuster movies (an &quot;Armegeddon&quot;/&quot;Deep Impact&quot; clone called &quot;Fire in the Hole&quot;), teenybopper stars, and Hollywood's many sins. Most interesting is the uphill struggle to get anywhere as an actor or writer in Hollywood. Michaela tries to sleep her way into a successful career, while Rachael tries to get through on talent. Finding out which one succeeds is pleasant -- not to mention a bit uplifting.<br />Williams also has plenty of writing talent. Her style is spare and concise, and she manages to juggle half a dozen interconnected plots without dropping anything. She also does an excellent job of giving each character their own distinct voice, background and an individual outlook on a very unfair world.

Anne Rice boldly goes where she's gone before in &quot;Servant of the Bones,&quot; a flaccid deviation from her Vampire Chronicles. Rice's plot has some raw promise, but it's quickly squandered by the dull characters and meandering, bizarre plot. It would take all of a genii's power to give some life to this story.<br />A genii arrives at a man's house one night, and relates the story of his life (and afterlife), and a weird tale it is too. Azriel was a young Jewish boy in Babylon, who had the unusual gift of being able to talk to the god Marduk. He permitted himself to be turned into a living gold statue, a human sacrifice for the sake of the Jews -- but things go horribly wrong when an old witch curses and murders him. Now he is no longer human, but a powerful spirit that isn't an angel or a demon.<br />Azriel spends centuries sleeping inside his own gold-encrusted bones, occasionally getting woken up to do something for his masters. Then he's suddenly out and about -- and there's no master. He witnesses the murder of a young girl, who recognizes him as &quot;the Servant of the Bones.&quot; The angry Azriel is determined to unravel the mystery of why the girl was murdered.<br />&quot;Servant of the Bones&quot; follows the format of the Vampire Chronicles: an incredibly attractive immortal relates his life story to a listener (who, oddly enough, never seems to need the bathroom during the long oral bio). But the grandeur and richness of her other writings is missing here.<br />Rice seems to be aware that her plot is too short and thin to be an entire novel. So she stretches it with lots of filler -- current events (no Bill-Clinton worship, please), her late husband's incomprehensible poetry, and endless descriptions of Azriel's skin, hair and eyes. Her usually colorful, sensuous prose is weirdly lifeless and dull here. And the plot is glacially slow.<br />Most strangely of all, Rice starts playing fast and loose with religion and history. And devout followers of Judaism will probably be grinding their teeth: the faithful are shown as self-righteous, slobbering fanatics, while the hero worships other gods and shares prostitutes with his dad. She bangs readers over the head with her assertions that there were many versions of the Old Testament. And Rice tries to bring Azriel to the present by a story-line about terrorists, murder and a cult, but the present-day story-line feels tacked-on.  It's like a supernatural Bond flick.<br />But it doesn't exactly help that Azriel is not a terribly interesting character at all. Over the centuries he never develops a personality, and his actions seem pretty random. Why is he so besotted with Esther? We never know. The villain is cookie-cutter, and most of the supporting characters (including the narrator) are utterly forgettable.<br />This story is a complete misfire for Rice, and a bewildering squandering of her considerable talents. Her dull characters and weird views on Old Testament history are only a few of the problems in the turgid, colorless &quot;Servant of the Bones.&quot;daism will probably be grinding their teeth: the faithful are shown as self-righteous, slobbering fanatics, while the hero worships other gods and shares prostitutes with his dad.

That seems to be the general message of Rumiko Takahashi's Mermaid Saga, starting off with &quot;Mermaid Saga: Forest.&quot; It's creepy, dramatic, and after reading it, you may never look at a mermaid picture the same way again.<br />In the first story, a strange young man named Yuta is travelling through Japan. He's one of the few human beings who has eaten the flesh of a mermaid and become immortal -- most of them die or turn into monstrous &quot;lost souls.&quot; He finds a mysterious village made up of vicious old women -- and a young girl named Mana, who has been made into an immortal without her knowledge.<br />Then it's flashback time, to Yuta's encounter with a young pirate girl named Rin several centuries in the past -- and a strange woman who wants the mermaid flesh for a mysterious reason. In the present, Mana and Yuta are taken captive by a white-haired young woman, who has been fed mermaid's blood -- and now she wants to switch bodies with Mana.<br />Takahashi clamps down on her humorous style in &quot;Mermaid Saga: Forest.&quot; There's no pratfall humor, cute characters, or funny scenarios involving alcohol, nudity or magic spells. There's blood, amphibious &quot;lost souls,&quot; some very nasty revenge plotting -- oh yes, and mermaids who make barracudas look cuddly.<br />And Takahashi weaves in some rather melancholy material about immortality. Sure, most people think it would be fun to live forever, but Yuta reveals that his wife aged and died while he stayed the same, and he tells Mana not to adopt a kitten because it will only die on her. And the romantic involvement with Rin is clearly doomed from the start, since Yuta would outlive her as well.<br />Mana and Yuta are a lot like Takahashi's other lead couples -- they start off on shaky ground, since Mana is basically a spoiled teenage brat, and Yuta is much older, with a lifetime of sorrow behind him. And her supporting characters are astoundingly vivid, like the ruthless land mermaid, or the old/young woman who was fed mermaid's blood.<br />Rumiko Takahashi strays into darker waters with &quot;Mermaid Saga: Forest,&quot; an imaginative and suspenseful dark fantasy collection. Highly recommended.the ruthless land mermaid, or the old/young woman who was fed mermaid's blood.<br />Rumiko Takahashi strays into darker waters with &quot;Mermaid Saga: Forest,&quot; an imaginative and suspenseful dark fantasy collection.

Eric Garcia gives us the wickedly funny evil twin of the chick-lit genre, in &quot;Cassandra French's Finishing School For Girls.&quot;<br />Cassandra French is your average modern L.A. woman -- she has two weird pals, a crazy mother under house arrest, a not-so-fulfilling job, and three gorgeous young men chained in the basement. Those three men are being remade and revamped at Cassandra's &quot;finishing school,&quot; where she takes boorish, alcoholic gropers and turns them into sensitive, polite, woman-friendly, color-coordinated men.<br />Then Cassandra meets hot actor Jason Kelly, who seduces her in an effort to sue the studio she works for. So Jason becomes the newest student at the Finishing School -- Cassandra doesn't plan to let the pretty-boy celebrity use women anymore. But things start to spin out of control when the enraged Jason manages to tangle himself up with chains and wires, and electrocutes himself. Now Cassandra has to dispose of the body, deflect suspicion, deal with the fiancee and unborn baby of one of the &quot;boys,&quot; and keep her friends from blabbing about her secret school...<br />It's a rare woman who hasn't met a jerk like the ones Cassandra has to deal with -- the sensitive, adorable Owen starts off as a drunken creep who doesn't understand the word &quot;no.&quot; Okay, nobody could really approve of Cassandra's methods to revamp her slobs and jerks into gentlemen (except toward guys like Jason). But it's certainly funny to see her do it.<br />For awhile, Garcia seems to be coasting plotwise -- Cassandra entangles herself with two men, scuppers a club, and teaches the boys. It's funny, but a little monotonous. But when Jason dies, things descend into a hilarious downward spiral. Cassandra's careful plans and regulations go completely out the window, and Garcia knows just how to milk the humor.<br />Cassandra is a hilarious retake on the chick-lit heroine. She's just avoids being amoral, by considering her &quot;teaching&quot; to be a favor to women, men, and the world in general. There's also a likably kooky backup cast of the tormented Claire, the idiotic yoga teacher Lexi, Cassandra's nutzoid mother, and the likable young nightclub owner whom Cassandra definitely likes.<br />Think a boot-camp &quot;Bridget Jones,&quot; and you have &quot;Cassandra French's Finishing School For Boys.&quot; Eric Garcia's best thus far, and a thoroughly entertaining read.dow, and Garcia knows just how to milk the humor. <br />Cassandra is a hilarious retake on the chick-lit heroine.

While it starts off strong, the draggy pace and boring recounting of the lead's life bogs it down, despite Rice's typically beautiful writing.<br />Tarquin Blackwood, a young vampire, arrives at the Vampire Lestat's apartment to deliver a letter asking for his help. Before he can drop it off, however, Lestat himself appears and take Quinn under his wing. But after the two of them feed, Lestat sees a strange spirit-like creature attach itself to Quinn, sucking some of the blood from him. This is Goblin, an invisible doppelganger who has been with Quinn his whole life.<br />Quinn recounts his life to Lestat: His childhood with Goblin, the invisible friend who never went away, quirky Aunt Queen and his mother, a vicious country singer called Patsy. He tells of his run-ins with the sexy ghost of his ancestor's mistress, his love for the promiscuous Mona Mayfair, and the strange events that led him to become a &quot;Blood Hunter.&quot; Except that now that he is a vampire, Goblin is becoming more powerful -- and malevolent -- as well.<br />&quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; starts off strong with supernatural mystery and mayhem in a Southern Gothic setting, with plenty of dirty family secrets, murder and ghosts. But as soon as Lestat starts listening to Quinn talk about his life, things start to drag. It wouldn't be surprising if Lestat wandered off to watch TV during the course of Quinn's monologue. It's that dull.<br />Occasionally Quinn offers a tidbit that is genuinely enticing, like the intricacies of his Southern gothic family, or the clues he uncovers about the beautiful, evil Rebecca. But it often feels like Rice is trying too hard to make it all feel surreal and supernatural. Hermaphrodite vampires and sex with spirits? Her lovely prose can't gloss over the self-conscious weirdness.<br />And Rice's writing is undeniably lovely, full of an aesthete's love of velvets and marble and cameos and so forth. The dialogue is where she stumbles -- there's too much of it. At the start of the book, there is an entire chapter of Lestat bickering with a Talamasca. And when he decides to seduce a thirtysomething servant, Quinn has what may be the worst (and most racist) pickup line in history: &quot;Be my chocolate candy. I'm real unsure of my masculinity.&quot; Time to swoon, girls.<br />It doesn't help that Quinn isn't a terribly interesting character either. He's basically a hormonal, immature teenage boy who can see ghosts. Aunt Queen, with her love of cameos, is a far more engaging character, while Patsy is fairly two-dimensional, if easily hateable. Lestat is enigmatic and alluring, for the relatively small part of the book he's actually in.<br />&quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; is too stretched out for its own good, but it's far from the worst Anne Rice has written.

It's a tragicomic experience, centering on the devastation of the Holocaust, and a modern-day quest for the past.<br />A young Jewish American man -- same name as the author, Jonathan Safran Foer -- travels to the Ukraine. His reason: to locate Augustine, a woman who apparently saved his grandfather from the Nazis... only he just has a photo to guide him. He's accompanied by an annoying, flatulent dog, and an old man haunted by war memories.<br />He also corresponds with the old man's quirky grandson Alex, and new revelations are made about both young men through their letters. And in the third story-line, we are treated to the history of Trachimbrod, an endearing shtetl full of peculiar people... which was destroyed by the Nazis long ago.<br />&quot;Everything is Illuminated&quot; seems to be primarily about the past and present, and how those two things connect. To twentysomethings now, World War II seems as distant in some ways as the Trojan War, unless brought to life by someone else's words. Foer may not have been there during the Holocaust, but his unique novel will leave you thinking and wondering about the past.<br />It's certainly an unconventional story. Foer has a quirky, offbeat style that gets a little off-kilter. And he bends everything from his narrative to the characters to the English language (&quot;spleening&quot;?).  Not to mention reality -- by naming his alter ego Jonathan Safran Foer, he blurs the line between fiction and reality. Is this based on anything real? Does Alex exist? Is there a Trachimbrod? At the end of the day, none of it matters. Even if these things don't actually exist, they certainly do have real counterparts.<br />Foer's book is not quite a work of genius. Sometimes the fragmented, topsy-turvy narrative runs away from him. Not to mention that the in-jokes -- the flatulent dog, the Russo-American dialect -- do not age terribly well. But the humor and magical realism tinges start to fade as the Holocaust looms overhead. While the opening chapters may make you laugh, it becomes far deeper and more intricate later on.<br />&quot;Everything&quot; may not be totally illuminated, but it is a quirky, sometimes saddening book that stumbles and takes a few risks.

And Dennis McKiernan's &quot;Red Slippers: More Tales of Mithgar&quot; deals with a handful of the loose ends from his now-finished fantasy series. They're a mixed bag, but McKiernan's faux-Tolkien writing is somehow more palatable in short stories.<br />Aravan and his crew from the Elvenship arrive at the &quot;Red Slipper,&quot; a bordello/inn, for some R&amp;R. They eventually start swapping stories: The story of Durek the Dwarf and how he almost drowned. The story of two Elves and a human who went hunting a giant leech. A legend and a real story clash in the tale of Gelvin, a petty thief whose stolen jewel destroys him. The evil mage Modru takes a horrible revenge on the swordsmith Dwynfor.<br />And when Urus, Riatha, Bair and Bair's girlfriend Jaith all arrive, there are some extra stories: How they went to the world of the Fey folk, and discovered what happened to drive them to Mithgar -- not to mention a comic tale about how they destroyed a cursed throne. And the Warrows share a particular tale about how the spirit of a dead High King ordered three Warrows to repay a debt handed down through the generations.<br />As proven in &quot;Tales of Mithgar,&quot; Dennis McKiernan is a lot better at writing short stories than novels. Newbies to this series will be hopelessly lost, but fans will probably be glad to see their old favorites again. His writing still pulls heavily from half the writings of Tolkien, but fortunately his generic Elves, halflings, dwarves and evil beasties are kept strictly on leashes.<br />McKiernan does a passable job of filling in the gaps, although one long-running mystery is brought up, then left unsolved. The story about Gelvin is so choppy that it's almost unreadable, and &quot;Groaning Stones&quot; is just flip-forward boring. However, in many of the other stories -- with comedy, action, and a bit of tragedy -- he manages a few solid thrills and chills.<br />His language is still painfully ye olde and sometimes incredibly clunky, with lines like &quot;He makes my very essence cower.&quot; There's also an unfortunate tendency to make the characters either bicker over minutiae, or laugh like lunatics. By cut-and-pasting chunks of his earlier novels, he makes some of the stories seem unevenly written. Not to mention that, again, he tends to be very repetitive -- especially when describing sexy dancing by Riatha and Jaith.<br />Those who have read the Mithgar series will probably gobble down McKiernan's latest, especially since it ties up most of the loose ends.

Perceval Press's &quot;Twilight of Empire: Responses to Occupation&quot; breaks that trend with understated, thought-provoking essays on the controversial Iraq war, which provide a pat on the hand and a punch to gut at the same time.<br />Amy Goodman's introduction at the start makes you start to think about the motives behind the war, and question what goes on behind the curtains. Then it's a look at Iraq itself, and at the damage wrought both by Saddam and by American troops. It's sobering, and more than a little shocking.<br />Mike Davis offers a rather stretched glance at empires, invasions, and the difficulties that come after them. Naomi Klein offers economic glimpses at financial motives behind attacking Iraq; women's activist Jodie Evans provides her journal insights from Iraq itself; and Ambassador Joseph Wilson puts his extensive knowledge of the Middle-East to use. Publisher Viggo Mortensen offers a quiet, bleak prose poem, &quot;Back to Babylon.&quot;<br />No war in decades has inspired controversy the way the present Iraq war has. And the general reaction to it is to knee-jerk. But &quot;Twilight&quot; wisely avoids propaganda, whining, ranting and name-calling. Instead, most of these writers merely present their opinions and stimulate the readers' thoughts. Some have even been to Iraq to see what has happened with their own eyes.<br />Whatever your political leanings, it's impossible not to be shocked by the deterioration of Iraq that is shown to us here, a crumbling country which is being weighted down to the breaking point. The political commentary is secondary to the vivid pictures of Iraq -- a place most people have never seen -- and its struggling people by those who have seen the aftermath.<br />Lynsey Addario's photographs prove an effective illustration of the essays. They're bleak, stark, and often very disturbing. There are pictures that are saddening looks at the struggling Iraqi people, and some that are simply appalling on a moral level, like an soldier goofing off in Saddam's pool.<br />Whatever your thoughts on the Iraq war are, &quot;Twilight of Empire&quot; is worth checking out, if nothing else to make you think, reconsider, wonder, and sympathize.

Now rereleased in their original order, this charming little collection mixes drama, comedy, and romance in equal measure.<br />Yusaku Godai has just returned from his stint in self-imposed exile... and he has a bad cold, Kyoko isn't home, and the other tenants are tormenting him. No sooner has he recovered than it's the holidays, and despite his poverty Yusaku manages to give his beloved manager a special gift for Christmas. But Valentine's day brings a new set of problems when Kozue gives him a gift of pansies (meaning: Keep me in your heart), and Kyoko finds out about them.<br />Things get more complicated when a frustrated Kozue asks Mitaka for advice on men -- and people think that Mitaka is secretly involved with Yusaku's girlfriend. But Yusaku has bigger problems: he finds himself threatened by the memory of Kyoko's late husband Soichiro, when Kyoko's father-in-law asks him to bring her Soichiro's old diary.  And Kyoko finds a strange entry in the diary, but the postcard that was tucked inside is missing. It fell out in Yusaku's bag. Will he do the right thing and return it to her?<br />Since the previous volume of &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; had lots of drama and misery and angst, Takahashi lightens things up here. Kyoko's imagination runs wild when she's urged to have kids -- she sees herself surrounded by dozens of squalling babies. Soichiro's food-diary is pretty odd. Yusaku's hormones run wild when Kyoko buys a leotard. And finally the &quot;ship of fools&quot; plays dress up with their high-school clothes -- yes, even the relatively sane Kyoko joins in.<br />But the romance ante is upped too, as Yusaku and Kyoko accidently kiss (after Akemi drunkenly smooches both of them), and Yusaku goes to great lengths to prove himself to the woman he adores. The two of them aren't involved -- and won't become so for a long time -- but Takahashi knows how to stretch out romantic tension without making it snap.<br />Our loser hero has grown up a little, and become more responsible and less of a goofball. And Kyoko (who is having sexy dreams about Yusaku) is definitely starting to move past Soichiro, although she's still definitely hung up on her late husband. And except for the beleagered preteen Kentaro, the other inhabitants of Maison Ikkoku are as nutty as ever.<br />In its fifth volume, &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; opts for fluffier standalone fare, but it's still quite touching and romantic.

A working-class boy secures a scholarship, and manages to pass himself off as one of the carelessly moneyed types who populate the school, hiding his middle-class Catholic/Jewish background. He and his classmates adore the (then-modern) classics, and are thrilled when major writers are called on to judge writing competitions at their school.<br />But the boy doesn't make an impression on Robert Frost. And because of a nasty cold, he can't even get into a competition judged by Ayn Rand. But when he learns that Ernest Hemingway -- his literary hero -- is the next judge, he's determined to catch the great man's attention. But to create a true-to-life story, he delves into a real-life story from his own school -- with disastrous results.<br />Don't read &quot;Old School&quot; if you need a lot of thrills. Like the school itself, &quot;Old School&quot; is a quiet, restrained book. And without preaching or being arrogant, Wolff manages to show us how important honesty of all kinds is to good literature. And at the same time, he can give his straightforward story twists and new dimensions.<br />Wolff shows exceptional insight into literature -- and how a teenage boy sees it. For example, the narrator becomes enamored of Ayn Rand's books at one point. Then he meets the author herself, and her arrogance and disdain strip away his appreciation for her works -- he sees how writers like Hemingway focus on people who may be ordinary, but are magnificent in their ordinariness.<br />Wolff's writing is spare and quiet, and his characters are sort of the same. There's the narrator, a naive young teen boy who grows up a lot over the course of the book -- even if he is the least alive of the characters -- the quirky classmates and the imposing Dean. And he does a wonderful job of translating Frost, Rand and Hemingway into his own words: Frost is faux-humble, Rand is unabashedly hypocritical and self-absorbed, and Hemingway is endearingly rambly.<br />&quot;Old School&quot; is an ode to good literature, and the &quot;old schools&quot; of the mid-20th century.

Not quite a drama, not quite a romance, and not quite a comedy, Rumiko Takahashi's charming series is still a charming mess of romantic problems.<br />The hapless college student Yusaku Godai is still trying to win the heart of the widowed manager Kyoko -- and a hunky, wealthy, charming rival called Shun Mitaka doesn't help his case, since Mitaka is as enamored of Kyoko as Godai is. Nor does the kitten he catsits, which happens to be called &quot;Kyoko Baby,&quot; or the comical sports injuries he gets.<br />But things take a nasty turn when Kyoko's parents begin nosing in her personal life -- her mom wants her to quit her job and remarry, and doesn't care that Kyoko likes her job and is still mourning her husband. Her dad doesn't want her to remarry at all. And when Kyoko encounters Godai and his sort-of-girlfriend, her jealousy begins to spin out of control.<br />&quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; is the only one of Takahashi's long-running series to not include a fantasy/SF element, so it's more like a witty sitcom. The slapstick tone of the first stories has been toned down a little, and the more dramatic, intense stories start to shine through, like Kyoko saying that she wants to stay a part of Soichiro's family a little longer.<br />Takahashi's artwork has become more polished by this point; it's not as polished as it now is, but the &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; style had settled firmly into its groove. She relies a little more on intentional comedy (a drunken Godai hugging Kyoko) than on slapstick, although she doesn't shy away from stuff like having Kyoko Baby wet Godai's bed.<br />Godai's one of those young guys who are a little bit hapless and pathetic. He's nice and generous and loving, but a mildly wimpy type. He dreams of Kyoko, but isn't yet mature enough for her. Kyoko herself has experienced a lot more -- true love, loss, and now she's starting to love again. Previously-introduced characters like the pleasant rivals-for-love Mitaka and Kozue return, and there are a few new ones like Kyoko's pushy, obnoxious parents.<br />&quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; starts to really blossom in the third volume, with more dramatic character tension and quite a few surprise twists. Highly recommended.eviously-introduced characters like the pleasant rivals-for-love Mitaka and Kozue return, and there are a few new ones like Kyoko's pushy, obnoxious parents.<br />&quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; starts to really blossom in the third volume, with more dramatic character tension and quite a few surprise twists.

The tale of a lovesick young college student who falls in love with his apartment manager is still sweet and funny in its third volume.<br />The presence of Yusaku's sort-of-girlfriend Kozue complicates things even further for him when Kyoko becomes incredibly jealous. And Kozue makes things even more awkward when Yusaku thinks that she wants to &quot;do it&quot; with him -- except he doesn't really know what he wants. And Kyoko's undefined budding relationship with Mitaka is disrupted, when her mother decides that the hunky coach would be an ideal second husband for her daughter.<br />But things take a dramatic turn when Mrs. Ichinose overhears Mitaka and Kyoko talking about a wedding -- not knowing that Kyoko is advising Mitaka on his sister's wedding. Devastated, Yusaku decides to move out of Maison Ikkoku and into a new apartment... an apartment occupied by a sultry masseuse and her bearish gangster husband, who get our wishy-washy hero to let them stay until they can afford a new place. And when Yusaku wants to come back to Maison Ikkoku, a jealous Kyoko tells him that he can't...<br />Things are never easy for the happless Yusaku Godai. And his non-relationship with Kyoko is probably the hardest of all -- every time something goes right, something will go wrong within a week. Their tangled feelings are a source of great amusement for the other inhabitants of Maison Ikkoku, including sexy waittress Akemi, the stone-faced peeping-tom Mr. Yotsuya, and earthy hard-drinking Mrs. Ichinose.<br />Takahashi's knack for characterization continues, especially her characters' abilities to either mess things up, or totally misinterpret what others are saying and thinking. Godai is still kinda spineless, but in a likable way; just about everyone knows at least one boy like him. Kyoko is a sweet, slightly introverted woman still dealing with her grief for her husband, and who gets insanely jealous over other girls near Godai. And while Mitaka and Kozue are obstacles for the two leads, they're not bad people. They're actually both quite likable, especially the suave, dog-phobic Mitaka.<br />&quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; is still engaging, romantic and funny, and shows every sign of getting funnier, more romantic, and brimming over with more angsty misunderstandings.

Tolkien	Books	2	11	13	N	N	Flawed and tainted	If you're looking for insightful, intriguing books about J.R.R. Tolkien, even as an introduction... look elsewhere. &quot;I Am In Fact A Hobbit: An Introduction To the Life and Works of J.R.R. Tolkien&quot; isn't up to the task, with flawed information and a very unpleasant aftertaste.<br />Author Perry C. Bramlett starts off with a by-the-numbers biography of Tolkien's entire life. He then tosses off some condescending information about Tolkien's children's books, before going on to the real meat of the storytelling: &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; &quot;Silmarillion,&quot; and many other major and minor works that he created. Finally -- apparently to make the book thicker -- he includes a timeline, website guide, and audio recordings guide.<br />There is some worthwhile material in this book, like the examples of how character names came about, and possible influences on Tolkien's work. And at the end of the book, Joe R. Christopher writes a wonderfully personal essay, which has all the life that Bramlett's boring prose lacks.<br />But Bramlett makes quite a few basic errors that should have been caught, including ones that are grammatical, misspelled and in his story retellings (the fay star in &quot;Smith of Wootten Major&quot; was IN the cake, not ON it). And, despite the aura of giving &quot;just the facts, ma'am,&quot; he throws in quite a few interpretations of his own, including a very strained idea of what Edith Tolkien's conversion to Catholicism inspired -- a loss of immortality? Surely he jests.<br />What's more, you get the idea from this book that Bramlett really doesn't like Tolkien as a person very much. He presents him as a bit of a Neanderthal towards women, very pushy and negative, and presents none of the vibrant genius that Tolkien clearly possessed. The Tolkien Bramlett lets you see here is like a stained paper doll.<br />Written in a dull style, with lots of misleading information, Perry C. Bramlett's &quot;I Am In Fact A Hobbit&quot; is not the place to start if you're just getting into Tolkien's works. It adds nothing, and takes out a lot.he place to start if you're just getting into Tolkien's works. It adds nothing, and takes out a lot.	2004-06-14

Tolkien, and the portrayal of things like goblins, elves and generic medieval civilizations always hinge on how the Master did it. But in his debut novel &quot;The Dark Tide,&quot; Dennis McKiernan takes so much so that the derivative elements far outweigh the original stuff. It's turgid, silly, and almost funny.<br />Tuck Underbank is a Warrow -- think a hobbit with shoes and &quot;large jewel-like eyes&quot; -- living in the peaceful Boskydells. When an unnaturally cold winter strikes and the evil Modru threatens the world, he and a number of his fellow Thornwalkers go to the High King's aid. But a vast expanse of lightless blizzard called the Dimmendark (sounds bad, doesn't it?) is spreading over the land, and Tuck soon finds that the &quot;dark tide&quot; is going to swamp them all.<br />Despite the fact that they're tiny and temperamental, the Warrows get included in the military forces. But the High King doesn't have enough warriors to hold off the horde of slobbering monsters who are coming to attack. And the battle goes horribly wrong, separating the friends from one another and possibly dooming them all.<br />The general feeling when reading &quot;Dark Tide&quot; is that McKiernan wanted to rewrite &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; in his own way, by including some horribly nauseating romance. There is literally nothing in here that Tolkien didn't do first and better. Even some of the names, such as Gildor and Laurelin, are lifted directly, while others (Underbank, Proudhand) are barely altered.<br />The Warrows themselves are like hobbits on some sort of armed testosterone trip. Imagine Frodo Baggins in the Marines -- silly image, isn't it? McKiernan doesn't stop there, carefully retreading every single fantasy cliches, including the Strong Noble Hero, the Damsel in Distress, the Evil Creepy Creatures, The Cackling Dark Lord, and the Small Yet Plucky Hero Who Must Save The World. It's all been done before, and it was a lot better the first time.<br />McKiernan writes in his own painful ye olde fantasye style, full of semicolons, mangled old-English phrases, and words like &quot;naytheless&quot; which actually don't make any sense. He assigns four or five names to every species, land, seasonal holiday, and so forth -- then insists on trotting those names out whenever he can. He also has difficulty with accents: One minute the Warrows sound like English countryfolk, then pirates, then Cockneys, then some sort of crazed redneck dialect.<br />He also tries to duplicate Tolkien's style, spelling &quot;wagon&quot; as &quot;waggon&quot; and having crowd murmurs in italics, as well as having Tuck and Company switch from using contractions and ordinary words, to formal prose. Every now and then he throws in the word &quot;lo.&quot; His writing is full of unwanted details. And sometimes his use of words is bewildering: on the very first page, we hear about Tuck kicking up &quot;clots&quot; of snow.<br />The good guys tend to all be buddies, and all the humans inexplicably adore the Warrows. Tuck Underbank is a pitiful excuse for a hero. He cries constantly, and never takes the initiative. High King Aurion and his son Galen are sickeningly noble and brave, while Gildor is just a generic elf. And the female characters are simply insulting: Merrilee is Tuck's token girlfriend, while Laurelin is a sweet, innocent, beautiful, utterly helpless princess who gets kidnapped and has to be rescued.<br />&quot;Dark Tide&quot; rips off and distorts J.R.R. Tolkien, and mixes the remains with some bad sword-and-sorcery.

While Ahern needs to polish up her writing, she has plenty of raw talent, and a good grasp on her quirky characters.<br />Holly and Gerry were the perfect couple. Not sickening perfect, but perfect for one another. And so when Gerry dies of a brain tumor, Holly feels utterly lost and depressed, staying in her apartment and deteriorating. Finally she emerges from her cocoon, but still isn't ready to reembrace life. Despite the efforts of her family and friends, she can't move on.<br />Then she receives a package from beyond the grave: the List. Gerry wrote it before his death, leaving her instructions to do things like buy a bedside lamp, sing karaoke, and ends every note with &quot;PS, I love you.&quot; Holly obeys the List -- sometimes happily, sometimes reluctantly -- and her new experiences help her to remember the past, while looking to the future.<br />&quot;PS I Love You&quot; is not your typical chick-lit. Sure, it has most of the usual trappings -- a young woman out in the world, the loud'n'lovable gay confidante, the outspoken best friend, the eccentric family complete with pink-haired baby sister. But there's no gooey love story with some new Hot Guy Du Jour, nor does it avoid the darker, more depressing experiences.<br />Ahern's writing is the sort that will be excellent when she gets a bit more writing experience. It's almost painfully awkward in places, the sort of thing that normally gets smoothed over by editors. But she has plenty of talent -- she makes the settings and characters come alive. And she knows how to mix grieving and humor, without making the humor less funny or the grief less heart-tugging.<br />Holly herself is a likable character, very true to life and sympathetic. Her family seems a little too bizarre at times, but weirdly enough, we all knows jerks, freaks and lovables like this.  Worse, we're related to some of them. And Gerry himself, despite being dead, is one of the more intriguing personalities in the book even if he only appears in Holly's memory.<br />Ahern needs to work on her sometimes-awkward writing style, but her humorous, melancholy slice of chick-lit  is a sweet read, especially for anyone who has had to say goodbye, and &quot;PS I Love You.&quot;Worse, we're related to some of them.

Unfortunately, with a limp title character and a meandering, weird plot, &quot;Merrick&quot; is most noteworthy for its unrealized potential and what it could have been, if Rice had cultivated it.<br />David Talbot encounters his protege/semi-lover Merrick Mayfair, an octaroon witch who now works for the Talamasca. He has an odd request for her: Louis de Point du Lac, a tormented vampire, wants to call up the spirit of the child vampire Claudia, so he can be reassured of her fate. And he needs Merrick's help to do so, since she has the ability to call up and control the dead with her voodoo magic.<br />David reflects on his first encounters with Merrick, her trips into the jungle in search of mystery artifacts, and the malevolent spirit of her dead sister Honey in the Sunshine. Now those artifacts may help her raise up Claudia's spirit, and might give Honey's spirit a way back into the world as well. But when Claudia is brought forth to speak with Louis, what she has to say may destroy him...<br />&quot;Merrick&quot; was advertised as the spot where the Mayfair and Vampire Chronicles converged, but that's kind of misleading. Except for some mentions of Julian Mayfair, there's only a vague connection with the &quot;white Mayfairs.&quot; It's mostly vampires and more vampires, with only the Talamasca (a sort of supernatural FBI) as a connecting point.<br />As always, Rice's writing is lush and brimming over with steamy New Orleans atmosphere. But she could use some editing. There are constant references to Merrick getting snockered on rum, her breasts, her clothes, David lusting after her, Louis burbling about how he loves her, and so on. And Rice seems to lose her way in the final chapters, as if she wasn't entirely sure how to wrap up what she had started.<br />The biggest flaw of the book is Merrick herself. She's certainly an intriguing character, a beautiful witch who wants to be a vampire, and isn't afraid to bend the men (and vampires) around her fingers to get what she wants. But she doesn't seem to have any flaws, motives, or recognizable emotions. We get no insights at all to what she's thinking. Louis is a rather ineffectual presence, and David is basically there to lust after Merrick. But Lestat's brief appearance toward the end sets the pages on fire.<br />While &quot;Merrick&quot; is overflowing with promise, hardly any of that promise is actually used.

Her writing is lackluster and the setting is sketchy, but the intricate plotline has promise, if she can learn to use it sufficiently.<br />The Archon, a vessel for an unnamed god, is sacrificed so that the drought will end and it will finally rain. But young priestess Mirany finds out something far more sinister when she goes to clean out the Archon's quarters -- he has left a note for her, warning her that the Speaker is not speaking for the god. Instead, she and her power-hungry lover are planning to set up a new, fake Archon to be their puppet.<br /><br />Mirany ends up befriending Oblek, a sozzled old musician, and Seth, a boy who has a deep, dark secret that he can never tell Mirany. When the god speaks directly to Mirany, she sends Seth and Oblek to find the new Archon in an impoverished village. But Mirany may have gone too far in her investigations -- and she may be the next one murdered.<br /><br />\\"The Oracle Betrayed\\" starts off on a shaky note. The setting is a random mishmash of ancient Greece and Egypt, and Fisher doesn't really explain the civilization or religious system at the beginning of the book. What are the Nine? What's up with that scorpion? Why's the old man dying? You'll find out eventually, but it's rather frustrating to have to take such things on faith.<br /><br />Fortunately, Fisher's plot steadies itself as she progresses through the book.

It lacks the oomph and tightness of the first two books, but the hilariously literate mystery is still enthralling.<br />Thursday Next is in self-exile. After her husband was erased as a blackmail ploy and the world was almost reduced to goo, she is lying low to wait for her baby's birth, and to figure out how to bring her husband back. Problem is, she is now living in an unpublished detective thriller in the Well of Lost Plots, a sort of fiction limbo. The fictional people are thrilled to meet an Outlander (a person from the real world), but Thursday must deal with some generic extra roommates, and a pregnancy by the husband who no longer technically exists.<br />Then her mentor dies horribly, and Thursday finds that her brain is being invaded by memory-erasing mindworm. She sets out to uncover a black market that is recycling characters, and to avoid the attacks of the evil Aornis. Soon the world of fiction is under attack yet again -- and it's Thursday Next to somehow stop everything from collapsing.<br />One of the greatest things about Fforde's books is how hysterically smart they are. Fforde peppers his book with the Lewis Carroll, Falstaff, the Questing Beast, Mr. Toad, the Minotaur, the early works of the Brontë sisters, Heathcliff, and much more. What's more, he gives them a wink-nudge twist worthy of the best of British comedy.<br />That isn't to say that it's perfect. Fforde seems to lose the flow from time to time, and the plot takes quite some time to figure out where it's going. But his dialogue is still wickedly funny (when talking about discarded fantasy novels: &quot;Do you have unicorns?&quot; &quot;Yes, sackloads&quot;), and his subtle satire is delicious. It almost makes you forget that the plot meanders.<br />Thursday is a little more weathered in her third mystery; she's a little more vulnerable than before, which has dulled her edge. She still totes a gun and can be the toughie when required, though. The hilariously tough Ms. Havisham and nurturing Gran serve as nice foils and backups. So do ibb and obb, a pair of generic background characters who have no personalities, backgrounds... or senses of humor.<br />Fforde's unique fantasy-mysteries are like reading an Escher print, with a bit of Monty Python sprinkled in the margins. &quot;Well of Lost Plots&quot; isn't as good as the two before it, but it's still wickedly intellectual goofiness.

Lewis, it's probably about his children's series &#34;The Chronicles of Narnia,&#34; which is a colorful but straightforward fantasy tale about skipping between worlds and a lion god-king.<br /><br />But Lewis was in his best form when he wrote his Space Trilogy, a sprawling H. G. Wells-inspired story about a philologist traveling between worlds and encountering increasingly strange life-forms. Unlike most sci-fi stories, Lewis manages to do double-duty with his focus -- the first volume, &#34;Out of the Silent Plane,t&#34; is a solid, dreamy slice of imaginative science fiction with deep philosophical underpinnings.<br /><br />During a walking tour of England, philologist Dr. Ransom encounters an old despised schoolmate named Devine, who is busy trying to abduct a mentally handicapped teenager. Things take a nasty turn after Devine and his accomplice Weston drug Ransom, and load him onto a spaceship. Over the course of a month's interstellar travel, Ransom learns that they are traveling to the planet Malacandra (Mars) -- and worst, he's destined to be a human sacrifice.<br /><br />After landing on Malacandra, Ransom manages to escape, and quickly finds himself alone on a strange alien world. But fortunately there is life on this world. He soon is taken in by the otterlike hrossa, and learns that there are three sentient species on Malacandra: the peaceful poetry-loving hrossa, the workaholic pfifltriggi, and intelligent seroni. When a hross friend of Ransom's is killed by the murderous humans, he sets out to find the mysterious, powerful Oyarsa, who might be able to help him and stop his kidnappers.<br /><br />While it does have some interplanetary travel, &#34;Out of the Silent Planet&#34; feels less like your average space opera, and more like a novel by H. G. Wells (the spaceship journey) or Edgar Rice Burroughs (the detailed descriptions of the weirdness of Malacandra). Big fleshy plants, sentient otter-people, decreased gravity and petrified forests all give it the feeling of a truly alien world, as do the three species who populate it.<br /><br />In fact, the aliens are perhaps the most alien you can find in fiction -- three dissimilar species, who work together and have no problems like war, starvation, lies, power-lust or any of the other problems that human beings have. It's underscored by Lewis's contemplative stretches of ethical and philosophical dialogue, and the thought-provoking approach to ideas like consciousness, cruelty, love and so on. And he takes some razor-sharp jabs at ideas such as the &#34;white man's burden&#34; or that people who &#34;aren't useful&#34; to society (such as the handicapped) being disposable.<br /><br />Lewis' writing has a dreamlike, somber quality that lends the story an eeriness that really permeates the entire story. And while Lewis' Christian beliefs are on view, I wouldn't classify this as a religious book -- rather it's a science fiction tale as seen and perceived through the lens of a man of faith. For instance, the character of Oyarsa could be seen as an angelic figure, a nearly invisible shimmer of light and shadow that rules Malacandra, but others might just perceive him as an alien. Others might see him as both.<br /><br />Lewis reportedly based Ransom on his close friend, fantasy author/philologist J. R. R. Tolkien, and there's an obvious affection for his protagonist even as he's kidnapped, sent into space and becomes a &#34;stranger in a strange land.&#34; He almost goes bonkers once or twice, but always makes it through with steadfast morality and intellect. On the other hand, Weston and Devine are the kind of person you have probably encountered in many comment sections -- they pay lip service to great advances and high ideals, but they are cold cruel men who value science and self above compassion and humanity. The opposite of the Malacandrians, in fact.<br /><br />&#34;Out of the Silent Planet&#34; is a spellbinding, vivid and beautifully written piece of science fiction, with the intelligence and open-mindedness to see that the limits between the scientific and the spiritual don't have to exist. Off to Mars!e that the limits between the scientific and the spiritual don't have to exist. Off to Mars!	2004-06-04

And \\"Beauty,\\" Susan Wilson's limp, colorless reworking of \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" is a failure as a fairy-tale retelling, because it lacks magic. More specifically, it lacks the magic of good writing.<br />Alix Miller arrives in New Hampshire paint the portrait of Leland Crompton, a reclusive writer who only communicates via computer. When Alix arrives, she learns why he's a recluse: Leland is disfigured by a rare disease called acromegaly (also called \\"Elephant Man's Disease\\"), and so he uses his detective alter ego to live the public life he can't.<br /><br />Despite already being in a relationship with hunky, well-off Mark, Alix starts to fall in love with Leland despite his outward deformities. But long years of loneliness and being shunned make Leland think that she can't possibly want to be with him. Can Alix dump her worthless boyfriend for the guy she really loves? And can Wilson resist the urge to give the book a gratuitous weeper ending?<br /><br />A modern \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" complete with the Beast's emotional hangups? Nope, doesn't work. Susan Wilson turns a classic fairy tales into a prosaic, predictable, plain-vanilla romance weeper. Take some boring dialogue, boring characters, a predictable storyline and a mess of scientific inaccuracies (related to acromegaly) and you have a recipe for a disastrous retelling.<br /><br />Wilson tries to maintain the fairy-tale atmosphere with the forbidding house and mystery recluse. But it dies when Leland comes onto the scene; it becomes a predictable emotional tug-o-war between Susan and her two lovers. It's painfully obvious what her decision is going to be, and the plodding, cliched dialogue between the two reluctant soulmates only makes the trip seem longer.<br /><br />What's more, Wilson's style is simply too dull. There's no sparkle or magic to her writing. She tries to spice things up with a gratuitously tragic ending, that merely turns it into a cheap melodrama, but by that time readers will find it hard to care what happens to Alix or Leland.<br /><br />Alix is an uninteresting heroine, especially since she doesn't seem very bright. Why did she get involved with Mark in the first place, since he's a jerk who just seems to use her as a sex toy? Leland is an uncompelling character, since he seems rather social and outgoing for a shunned recluse. And Mark... what else need be said? Wilson apparently cannot write well enough to give Leland a decent rival.<br /><br />Some writers like Jane Yolen can give modern spins on old fairy tales, without losing that hint of magic.

Byatt reached her artistic pinnacle in the erudite, exquisite &quot;Possession.&quot; But she's still in excellent form in &quot;Little Black Book of Stories,&quot; a simple short story collection that embraces the tender, the macabre, and the fantastical, all wrapped in her lush prose.<br />&quot;The Thing in the Forest&quot; opens with a pair of young girls wandering in the woods -- only to come across a ghastly, inhuman monster. That monster haunts their memories as they grow up separately. &quot;Body Art&quot; tells of a obstetrician and his strange quasi-romantic relationship with a messed-up art student, which raises questions about birth, death and love.<br />&quot;A Stone Woman&quot; is born after surgery, when Ines finds that her body is slowly changing into a form of living stone. &quot;Raw Material&quot; takes a nasty twist, when a creative writing class, and a strange story, ends in murder. And &quot;The Pink Ribbon&quot; introduces James, an old man caring for his senile wife Mado... until a strange young woman with a connection to Mado comes into his life.<br />The thing that links the parts of &quot;Book&quot; together is the fantastical and horrific. &quot;Body Art&quot; is the one that doesn't fit in, since it's all solidly set in the real world; but the rest is a mass of Icelandic troll-women, ghosts of people who are still alive, and the Loathly Worm. Even &quot;Raw&quot; is a horror story, based on the evil that people can do.<br />Byatt's stories are beautifully self-contained, even if they don't always end on a completely conclusive note (the exception being &quot;Thing,&quot; which feels unfinished). And her writing is still outstanding, flexible and versatile; she can write like a child or an intellectual, a writer or a scientist. She goes slightly overboard describing the various kinds of stone that the &quot;Stone Woman&quot; turns into, but that's a minor detail.<br />Richly-written and wonderfully evocative, &quot;Little Black Book of Stories&quot; is a rewarding if slightly flawed collection of Byatt's latest. An excellent way to pass a sunny afternoon.tle Black Book of Stories&quot; is a rewarding if slightly flawed collection of Byatt's latest. An excellent way to pass a sunny afternoon.	2004-06-02

After peddling such ghastly books as &quot;The Kennedy Curse&quot; and &quot;Just Jackie,&quot; Klein engages in literary graverobbing with the putrid &quot;Farewell Jackie: A Portrait of Her Final Days.&quot;<br />His primary focus is the final illness and death of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, of non-lymphoma cancer that seemed easily treatable. By this time, Ms. Onassis had transcended her tabloid-speckled former lives and had a good job, a man she loved, and grandchildren she adored. But when her cancer spread, Onassis tried to die with the illusion of dignity she had maintained in her life.<br />Reading &quot;Farewell Jackie&quot; is a bit like watching someone break open a grave to frisk the bones of the dead. Padding the story of Jackie's illness and death are stories of her earlier life -- primarily her second marriage, and various love affairs she had (one of which has been denied by the man involved). Dirt-dishing, anyone?<br />Jackie Kennedy Onassis is portrayed as downright saintly in this book; Klein glosses over the hypocrises and flaws in her personality, such as being &quot;religious&quot; yet ignoring tenets of that religion. Even the volatile nature of her relationship with her second husband. Oddly enough, this adoration doesn't extend far enough, especially at the end. Any semblance of dignity is shredded when Klein goes into grotesque detail about Onassis's final mental and physical deterioration.<br />What's more, Klein's writing is deplorable. He transcribes private conversations and moments when Onassis was alone -- all obviously faked. Not to mention that Klein is in desperate need of an editor for this book's many errors. On one page, Klein informs us, &quot;Jackie a wreck.&quot; Verbs? We don't need no stinkin' verbs.<br />Farewell, Jackie. Too bad Klein had to write this book and peddle it as a memorial volume for you. &quot;Farewell Jackie,&quot; thankfully, is clearly destined to sink into the mire of obsequious, poorly-written Kennedy books.s clearly destined to sink into the mire of obsequious, poorly-written Kennedy books.	2004-06-02

It's so light and frothy and predictable that it ultimately is a lot more annoying than entertaining, with the designer brand-names and cutesy kids.<br />Becca Reinhart is a high-powered businesswoman. Edward Kirkland is an idling playboy with a shallow socialite girlfriend. The only thing they have in common (besides oodles of money and a disinclination to marry) is friendship with the adoring couple Amy and Arthur. Unfortunately, Amy and Arthur are killed in a tragic plane crash, leaving a four-year-old daughter behind.<br />But because they were unmarried and made separately, their wills leave joint custody to Becca and Edward. Despite the fact that they don't even know each other, Becca and Edward do their best to be a surrogate mommy and daddy for little Emily. They have no experience, and have to deal with nosy child shrinks, a delighted &quot;Bubbe,&quot; and their own growing attraction.<br />&quot;Family Trust&quot; is your basic chick-lit with a precociously, sickeningly cute child thrown in, apparently because Becca and Edward would be disgusted by each other otherwise. You can basically tell within in the first few chapters just what is going to happen at the end. And the stretch of goofy plot developments, like Becca hunting down a nice Jewish man to marry quickly, don't make the trip any more fun.<br />Brown's writing is amusing and breezy in many places with her spoofing of yuppie childrearing, but it lacks wit. In its place, she puts dozens of brand-names, chic New York locales, and drooling descriptions of the characters' clothes, hair and furniture. It's amusing in a way for a few chapters, but then the materialism starts to wear a bit thin -- enough about tiaras, Mozart classes, mohair cardigans, and no more about &quot;jungle cat&quot; fads.<br />Becca and Edward are singularly flat characters -- they're both gorgeous single people with a soft spot for kids. Not much more to them than that. Emily herself is one of those obviously fake, idealized small children that populate such books. The one shining star is Becca's warm, flamboyantly-dressed mom, who comes across as the most real person in the whole book.<br />Predictable and lighter than a feather, &quot;Family Trust&quot; is a basic point-A-to-point-B chick-lit novel, with forgettable characters and blah writing.hey're both gorgeous single people with a soft spot for kids.

Harris' Young Heroes series is perhaps the best so far, with its thrilling plot and excellent characterization. &quot;Jason and the Gorgon's Blood&quot; gives an extra dimension to the mythical hero, while giving readers a likable underdog to root for.<br />Jason and a bunch of other boys are apprenticed to the wise old centaur Chiron. One day a bit of misbehavior gets them all sent on an errand, only to return to find that Chiron has been beaten almost to death -- and two mysterious jars have been stolen from him. He reveals to Jason that the jars hold the Gorgon's blood; one can cure anything, even raise the dead, and the other is a potent poison. He also reveals that Jason is the rightful heir to the city of Iolcus, which fellow apprentice Acastus is prince of.<br />Now a horde of nasty centaurs have stolen them, and it's up to Jason and his fellow apprentices to find the jars before Iolcus is destroyed. But the boys don't know enough about the dangers ahead of them: harpies, angry goddesses... and Acastus himself, secretly plotting to kill Jason. Jason has to somehow whip the boys into a cooperative team, before the army of centaurs can use the Gorgon's blood for themselves.<br />The Young Heroes series is an interesting idea in itself -- Greek heroes and heroines shown as uncertain teens. And Jason's gradual journey is a solid, pulse-pounding one, hinting at his future adventures with the Argonauts. It has the basics of the other books -- god cameos, monsters, hints of the adult lives of the heroes -- but somehow it's a bit smoother this time around.<br />Yolen and Harris's writing is detailed and fast-moving. There are a few nuggets of humor thrown in, but overall the tone tends to be grim. And of course, Greek mythology buffs will be delighted by the cameos by such characters as harpies, Chiron the centaur, Argos the shipwright and Alcestis (who makes an appearance in some myths about Hercules).<br />The relationship between Acastus and Jason is excellent. Jason is struggling both to keep himself alive and to be a leader, knowing that Acastus wants him dead. Acastus, on the other hand, grows from being a brat prince to being a conflicted young man who respects Jason. That theme of gradual friendship under fire is freshly written.<br />&quot;Jason and the Gorgon's Blood&quot; is an intense, intriguing look at the early life of one of the greatest Greek heroes of legend.

It's a beautiful, engrossing book with plenty of interesting characters and a lush prose style that is unforgettable.<br />Old, wealthy Oswaldo lives in a decayed house, reflecting on his aged body and lonely life, until he decides to create a &quot;water villa&quot; like nothing anyone has ever seen. Max travels from London to New Orleans to woo a beautiful woman he has fallen in love with, gets an American makeover, and puts on a spectacular Futurist banquet -- all to get her attention.<br />Sensitive artist Anton and his depressed wife Josephine struggle to have a child, even as Anton goes to Venice to work for Oswaldo on his &quot;water villa.&quot; And Lach leaves his girlfriend Vera for the beautiful Italian Francesca, only to learn that Vera is also in Italy -- working on a portrait for Oswaldo. As the story unfolds, the lives of these friends, lovers and acquaintences mingle together.<br />Water is the center of this novel -- a sea-themed banquet, a water villa, mentions of levees and the Sargasso Sea. And &quot;Marriage of the Sea&quot; itself is like water -- going quickly from one story to another, mingling all of them together into one fluid mass that is always shifting around. There isn't much of a plot, nor much in the way of humor (except Max's pitiful efforts to impress Lucinde), but the half-dozen subplots serve to keep it afloat.<br />At first glance, Alison's view of New Orleans and Venice don't have much in common besides water. But as &quot;Marriage&quot; progresses we see that they share a sense of genteel decay, with the boarded-up ballrooms and decrepit villas sinking into the sea. Her sense of atmosphere is outstanding, recalling A.S. Byatt at her best; the entire book has a sort of liquid, murky feel.<br />And the characters are, if not well-rounded, then engagingly realistic -- the confused, artistic Anton, the depressed Josephine, the puppy-like Max, and the creepy Lach. Each one is searching for something -- a lover, a home, a baby -- and Alison draws us into their respective quests without making them pathetic.<br />Jane Alison's &quot;Marriage of the Sea&quot; is a liquid, languid journey to New Orleans and Venice, with a dash of dark humor and some mild tragedy.

Miserable, he decides to get over her (in the tradition of old novels) by going to the US, and somehow ends up in the dinky Vermont town of New Cardiff. The inhabitants are a bit odd but friendly, and Colin befriends quite a few when he sketches their portraits. He also becomes acquainted with Mandy, a smart, supportive young woman who starts giving him therapy for his broken heart.<br />But then Vera -- the woman who dumped Colin -- comes onto the scene. She reveals that the guy she supposedly dumped him for was all part of an elaborate joke. Colin forgives her for her involvement in tricking him, but now he's got an awkward love triangle to deal with. Vera is determined to scupper his new relationship with Mandy, and Mandy is saying that she never wants to see him again.<br />&quot;New Cardiff&quot; starts off on a promising note, with a guy going to new places to mend his broken heart. And the basic plot is a classic one -- a love triangle where the third party has to deal with old and new lovers, as represented by the countries they come from. But it feels instantly forgettable. Webb adds nothing new to the tale, and despite being around 350 pages long, the story itself is very short.<br />But Webb's writing is not up to the task -- it's suspended somewhere between bland screenplay and not-detailed-enough fiction. No descriptions, little action -- just page after page of dialogue. And the dialogue isn't exactly Shakespeare either: &quot;It doesn't really show.&quot; &quot;It doesn't?&quot; &quot;We've had worse.&quot; &quot;Than this?&quot; &quot;Much.&quot; There are stretches of dialogue that are ALMOST witty, but they fall short because they are so underwritten.<br />And as a result, the characterization suffers. There's plenty of chemistry and cute bits between Mandy and Colin -- although his tale of first having sex with Vera is cringingly bad -- but unfortunately Vera is a cardboard cutout. The villagers also are bogged down with basic personalities and nothing else-- the nosy guy, the Jesus freak, and so on.<br />&quot;New Cardiff&quot; suffers from a terrible case of underwriting and an overabundance of cliches.

She vacations in Hotel Croix St. Bernard, a ski lodge in Valmeri, France, and encounters an odd gaggle of people including a lustful count, likable poet Robin, and sexy TV executive Emile. But things take a nasty turn when an English publisher, Adrian Venn, and his young wife are nearly killed in an avalanche.<br />When it seems that Venn is probably going to die, his assorted children show up, including an illegitimate daughter married to Emile, who is having a fling with his wife's half-sister. Now it's a fight between the French and the British -- the inheritance will be divided differently, depending where Venn dies. Amy, trying to do a good deed, ends up ensnaring herself in a bitter family feud.<br />Diane Johnson seems to have a bit of a love-hate relationship with France -- love everything about it except the attitude towards Americans. Blaming American planes for an avalanche is only the start; the cultural clashes between France, England and the United States are at the core of the novel, adding spice to a typical family feud.<br />Johnson's writing is fresh and detailed, and for much of the novel she intrigues with stories of sexy Eurotrash, chic ski lodges and extended families linked by one loathed man. And she manages to wriggle in some cultural insights: how different cultures are seen across the world and how those viewpoints can be wrong -- like lumping all Americans into one big group.<br />Unfortunately, things start unravelling near the end. The plot simply  starts meandering, as if Johnson couldn't figure out what to do to wrap up the storyline. There's a shocker lawsuit and divorce thrown in to maintain tension, but &quot;L'Affaire&quot; simply runs out of plot twists. So it grinds to a halt in a flurry of legalspeak.<br />Johnson tends to create characters by type: the French tend to be calculating and obnoxious, the Brits tend to be bitter, and the Americans nice but a bit dumb. Amy seems like a nice if bland character, until she starts sleeping around for no good reason. The supporting characters tend to be rather obnoxious, except for well-meaning teenager Kip, who just wants his sister and nephew to be all right.<br />&quot;L'Affaire&quot; loses steam at the end, but it's an amusing light read with a twisted family and a young woman just trying to help.

Lackluster characters, silly dialogue and a lack of imagination make &quot;Wizard&quot; an ideal cure for insomnia.<br />Nell is a young princess in Xandria, who is learning some witchcraft but craves more knowledge. The ante is upped when, on her birthday, a horde of evil banshees invade the castle and attack her father. The wizards fail to banish the creature, but Nell manages to. That unexpected success spurs her to ask if she can try to become the next Imperial Wizard.<br />Of course, her father says no; not only is she a princess, but she's a girl, and only boys can be wizards. But Nell won't be held back -- she sets out on the necessary journey, believing that she just might be the prophecied chosen one who will defeat the evil Graieconn of Darkearth, a dark lord who can't stand even a little light. But is Nell the chosen one, and can she do what all the boys who tried before her have failed in?<br />If you think it sounds familiar, that's because it is. Koller draws on everything from Star Wars to Harry Potter -- you have the necessary dark lord, dragons, castles, prophecies, magical wands, generic medieval civilizations, plucky princesses and pyrotechnic magic. There is not a single original element in the entire book.<br />Worse, it isn't even well-written. The dialogue is on par with a Saturday morning cartoon show (&quot;Spirits of the Sacred Light! Take this darkness from our sight!&quot;), and the descriptions are lackluster at best and wretched at worst (&quot;Oozy things squished under her feet&quot;).<br />Nell is like a thousand plucky princesses that we've seen before; she really has no personality worth speaking of, and her courage and gutsiness seem two-dimensional because there is no reason for her to act as she does. Supporting characters like Minna the demidragon and her father come across as cardboard props.<br />Unoriginal and terribly written, &quot;A Wizard Named Nell&quot; only promises to get more grindingly terrible as the series progresses.

Her cousin Fan Shaw (also about fourteen) is already dressed like a young woman, and hangs out with a gang of shallow, trendy girls. Polly befriends old ladies, sings Scottish airs, and reads books on history. Can she fit in? What's more... does she really want to?<br />Fast forward about five or six years: The Shaw family learns that Polly is returning to the city, intending to give music lessons to help support her brother. Time hasn't really changed Polly -- she's still sweet-natured, moral and pleasant to everyone. But the Shaw family is in serious financial trouble -- and Polly will help out the only way she knows how.<br />In the late 1800s, &quot;Girl&quot; was written in two separate halves, which might explain why the second half is so much better than the first. The first isn't bad, but it suffers from a sort of prissiness. Virtually every story centers on Polly's moral struggles, with no break. Her story is far more engaging when she learns confidence and strength, not when she's wavering about peer pressure.<br />As in &quot;Little Women,&quot; Alcott's writing is still pretty readable for modern readers, although most people will not know what a &quot;pannier&quot; is. She also writes a good understated love story, in Polly's gradual interest in her cousin Tom. You'll know that these two really need to get together, but it's going to take them awhile. So sit back and enjoy the ride.<br />Polly may put you off at first with her air of vague goody-two-shoes-ness, but she improves over the course of the book. Somewhat more realistic are the spoiled little brat Maud, the grumpy Tom, and the pretty but air-headed Fan. Grandmother isn't quite so engaging; she seems like an idealized older person who exists just to dispense wisdom.

If anything, &quot;Naked Sun&quot; is more imaginative and tightly-written than the previous novel, &quot;Caves of Steel,&quot; with its unconventional detecting and seemingly unsolvable crime.<br />Cop Elijah Baley isn't too fond of robots. Or Spacers. So he's less than pleased when he is sent to Solaria, a sparsely populated world where robots do all the work, and humans &quot;toil not, neither do they spin.&quot; He's there to investigate a strange murder -- a scientist named Delmarre was murdered, and his widow Gladia is the only possible suspect. But she seems too ditzy and fluttery to crush a person's skull.<br />When an official is poisoned right in front of Baley, his suspicions are confirmed -- somebody is still murdering, and it may be linked to some touchy political subjects that Delmarre was working on. No human was close enough to kill either man, and no robot was capable of murder. With the assistance of his robot sidekick R. Daneel Olivaw, Lije Baley starts to unravel a mystery that seems to have no suspects...<br />Does a world full of languid, long-lived people waited on by robots sound like paradise? It won't after &quot;Naked Sun,&quot; where such a civilization is enough to drive you nuts with boredom. Asimov did an excellent job with the Solarian civilization, where actually being in the same room as another person is considered an unspeakable intimacy and the world &quot;children&quot; is almost obscene.<br />Since this is all completely foreign to Lije Bailey (who comes from overcrowded Earth), it comes across as alien to the readers as well. It also adds an enticingly weird dimension to his detective work: Bailey has to solve a mystery entirely through communication equipment, and robots keep clearing away evidence. Add some agoraphobia and solid social commentary, and you have a story that is reminiscent of Agatha Christie writing Star Wars.<br />Bailey and Daneel make an excellent team -- there's Bailey's human gut feelings and intuitions into the human mind, coupled with Daneel's cool calm robot logic, and his lack of prejudices. The supporting characters are also nicely done, particularly the mildly neurotic Gladia and the nervous Gruer.<br />Asimov's &quot;Naked Sun&quot; is a tighter, tauter mystery than &quot;Caves of Steel,&quot; with a bizarre civilization and a mystery that seems impossible to figure out. Immensely enjoyable and thought-provoking.of Agatha Christie writing Star Wars.<br />Bailey and Daneel make an excellent team -- there's Bailey's human gut feelings and intuitions into the human mind, coupled with Daneel's cool calm robot logic, and his lack of prejudices.

But his most outstanding work may be &quot;History of Danish Dreams,&quot; a magnificently dreamlike novel -- not of Danish history, but Danish dreams.<br />The manipulative Carl Laurids was adopted by the steward of Morkhoj, a place where (the tyrannical Count has declared) time stands still. Elsewhere, little Amalie Teander is nearby when her fearsome grandmother dies; despite the fact that the old lady was illiterate, she somehow predicted the future in the newspapers... and then in her last will and testament, including how her daughter-in-law would die and how the house would be run.<br />And then there is the sweet, innocent Anna Bak, seemingly one of God's chosen, and Adonis, who turns away from thievery. Taking place in several generations over four centuries (16th to 20th), it shifts from surreal aristocratic realms to impoverished fishing villages, as the fates of the different people intertwine.<br />Don't expect a taut thriller like &quot;Smilla&quot; or a chilly sociological study like &quot;Borderliners.&quot; Hoeg's first novel is far more nuanced and rich, with a dark, weight atmosphere hanging over the ornate language. It's a social satire, but so subtle that it only dawns on readers gradually just what he's saying through his surreal stories.<br />This book is well-named -- &quot;History of Danish Dreams&quot; does, indeed, seem like a dream. It's a reflection of our own world, but twisted and darkened. At times, Hoeg lets the storyline run away from him, as if the many intricate storylines are spilling out of his hands. But he makes up for this with his outstanding, poetic descriptions of the decayed Count's lands, the dusty house of Amalie's family, and the stinking little village.<br />His characters tend to be rather distant; there are so many of them that it's a bit difficult to get attached to them. But they are definitely interesting, from the manipulative Carl to the observant Amalie to the sweet, innocent Anna. Somehow the nastiest characters are the most fascinating, such as the Count who declares time &quot;a common, modern invention.&quot;<br />A strange and unique debut, &quot;History of Danish Dreams&quot; is Peter Hoeg's best novel to date.

Zelazny writes with his usual minimalist poetry, but the finale and characters are definitely lacking. It's a nice read, but far from Zelazny's best.<br />Charles Render is a neuroparticipant therapist -- he taps into his patients' dreams and analyzes them to tell them what their undisclosed problems are. For example, he finds out that one man imagines enemies because the alternative is being ignored. His own problems go un-dealt with -- the death of his wife in a car crash, which has left him with some lingering guilt issues.<br />Then he meets Eileen Shallot, who wants the same kind of job he has. The problem is: she's been blind all her life, and no therapist of that kind has ever been blind because they get overwhelmed by the dreams. But he agrees to help Eileen gradually -- by letting her see through his eyes.<br />&quot;Dream Master&quot; was once a short story, and was expanded dramatically to make it into this novella. It's definitely a mixed blessing -- on one hand, Zelazny has plenty of room to paint strange dreamscapes and weird twists of the imagination. On the other, &quot;Master&quot; is definitely padded.<br />So long as &quot;Master&quot; sticks close to the interactions between Charles and Eileen, the story stays solid and sleek. But there are also a lot of scenes that do nothing except distract, like anything involving Jill DeVille (Charles' bland girlfriend) or the talking doggie.<br />Certainly Zelazny takes an unconventional and interesting idea -- psychotherapy using a &quot;dream machine&quot; -- and manages to wring a whole book out of that sole idea. His sparse prose really blossoms in the dream sequences, becoming lusher and stranger. They're not terribly strange as dreams usually are, but they're definitely interesting.<br />Charles isn't a terribly likable protagonist; he's a bit of a know-it-all. Okay, he's a doctor, but his condescension towards his patients comes across as arrogance. Eileen seems a little more likable, with her obsession with overcoming her disabilities. The other characters -- Charles' son and Jill -- are pretty much nonentities.<br />&quot;Dream Master&quot; makes up for lackluster characters with Zelazny's imagination and excellent prose.

Tolkien is known best for the thrilling epic &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and the works that accompany it. But &quot;Poems and Stories&quot; encompasses several shorter, less-well-known works, while giving a more rounded view of Tolkien's unique brand of genius.<br />&quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot; is a charming collection of poems, mostly linked to Middle-Earth. They range from dark to whimsical, with trolls, dragons, elves, and &quot;shadow-brides.&quot; The poem &quot;The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth&quot; dips into medieval dramas, followed by Tolkien's thoughtful, fantasy-based ponderings &quot;On Fairy-Tales,&quot; a long essay on the nature of good fantasy.<br />Then Tolkien's short novels come into play. &quot;Leaf By Niggle&quot; is an odd, pleasant little story about an artist named Niggle, who has to make a journey; &quot;Smith of Wootten Major&quot; is a beautiful little tale about a lost fairy king and a young smith who ate a fay star. Finally there's &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham,&quot; a tongue-in-cheek comic tale about a bumbling farmer who, because of a deaf, nearsighted giant, inadvertantly becomes a hero.<br />There's no flagging of quality in &quot;Poems and Stories&quot; -- all of the material Tolkien wrote that is included here is top-notch, whether comic, dramatic or poetic. Some readers may be put off by the classically-written &quot;Homecoming of Beorhtnoth,&quot; but it is still an excellent piece of work. He can argue forcefully, charm with sweet poetry, or tell an amusing story about bumbling heroes and not-so-fierce dragons.<br />Tolkien's exceptional writing is put on display in &quot;Poems and Stories,&quot; a beautiful collection full of the Master of Middle-Earth's art. Highly Recommended.	2004-05-22

The reknowned author of &quot;House of the Spirits&quot; is out of her element in her second excruciating fantasy for teens, &quot;Kingdom of the Golden Dragon.&quot; Tepid thrills, horrible love stories and constant preaching bog down a thin plot until it collapses.<br />In the Himalayas, Buddhist monk Tensing and his crown-prince sidekick encounter the legendary Yetis, and save the meager tribe from extinction. Elsewhere, Alexander Cold (who now insists on being called &quot;Jaguar&quot;) accompanies his grandmother to the Kingdom of the Golden Dragon, a place that allows virtually no outside (read: American) influence inside. Nadia comes along with them.<br />But things take a nasty turn when Nadia and a bunch of other girls are kidnapped by the Sect of the Scorpion, a band of vicious warriors. Alexander goes after his friend, only to stumble into Tensing, who has rescued Nadia. Then they uncover a sinister plot to kidnap the king, and that the Sect is planning to make off with a magical statue that tells the future.<br />In &quot;City of the Beasts,&quot; Allende couldn't stop preaching. In &quot;Kingdom,&quot; she's gotten even worse. While talking about how wonderful the isolationist dictatorship Kingdom is, she condemns the materialism of (yes, again) the nasty nature-destroying Western civilization. And again, there are more hairy subhuman beastie tribes -- although the &quot;army of Yetis&quot; scene is more funny than thrilling.<br />Her preaching doesn't end there, either -- her slobbering monologues on the tenets of Buddhism get old fast, like listening to someone reading from a religious pamphlet. And with a complete lack of subtlety, she makes the villain a cartoonish megamogul, and the heroes a band of pure-hearted, nature-loving pacifists.<br />Does Allende's writing salvage the wilted plot? In a word... no. Her writing is tepid and lacking in detail, the pace is glacial, and the attraction between Nadia's pal and the prince turns into true love in about five pages. Perhaps the most annoying fact is that the characters are never really in danger. Whether it's invincible martial arts, healing with &quot;the energy of the universe,&quot; telepathy or turning invisible, the heroes have a superpower for every occasion. I have yet to meet a Buddhist monk who could do half the things Tensing does.<br />Allende seems reluctant to spend any time actually developing the characters. Alexander and Nadia, being &quot;pure of heart,&quot; are about as fun as dental surgery. Alexander in particular has shed any skepticism and quirks, and now believes everything he hears. In short, he has essentially become a male version of Nadia, who dazzles the idiot natives with her little tricks. And super-monk Tensing drops strings of cliches (&quot;We are what we think. Our thoughts construct the world&quot;) before sauntering off to kick butt.<br />Isabel Allende's sophomore excursion into the world of young adult fantasy proves that &quot;City of the Beasts&quot; was not a solitary flop.

Barron takes a brief but inspiring look at heroism in &quot;The Hero's Trail: A Guide For a Heroic Life.&quot; Don't expect a parade of government leaders and superstars-who-rose-up-from-their-backwater-farm stories. Instead he presents smaller, more intimate stories about real-life people from all cultures and walks of life.<br />Barron starts off by explaining what he means by heroism and comparing the ideal to hiking. He brings up people who are well known (Pocahontas, the Biblical Esther), legendary figures (Sheherezade, Prometheus), artists like MS sufferer and poet Mattie Stepanek, scientists like Stephen Hawking, and world leaders such as Abraham Lincoln.<br />And then there are the less obvious ones -- the heroes that are relatively little known. There's Sokhoeun Chhunn, a girl whose response to racist insults was to organize cultural events; Samuel Long, who won at everything he tried despite his deafness; and then-six-year-old Michael Munds, who organized a charity competition for the families of the Oklahoma City Bombing. One of the most touching is Sadako Sasaki, a girl ultimately killed by radiation from WW II, who made cranes for world peace.<br />Perhaps most likable about &quot;The Hero's Guide&quot;  is that Barron really doesn't allow barriers in what he considers &quot;heroism.&quot; He devotes page after page to people from different cultures, countries, and many of them are kids, like a young boy who started counselling others to keep them out of gangs. Sometimes their heroism is based on generosity, courage, or their strength of convictions. But it's remarkably insightful.<br />Barron clearly admires the many heroes he profiles here, but he doesn't gush about them. Instead he presents the facts, what made the person special, and allows the readers to draw their own conclusions. Interspersing the real-life stories are Barron's own anecdotes, and a few final thoughts on what makes a hero.<br />T.A.

This crazy quilt of magazine articles is obviously a rush-job, and leaves a &quot;bad taste&quot; in the mouth.&quot;<br />Peter Jackson is best known for co-writing and directing hit movie trilogy &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; But he started off as a young Kiwi boy experimenting with a camera, and later getting together with his buddies to film the low-budget horror/SF-comedy &quot;Bad Taste.&quot; An understated indie career led to the brilliant docudrama &quot;Heavenly Creatures,&quot; which kick-started the career of star Kate Winslet. And from then on, he started the sprawling adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved epic fantasy, which has been embraced as a worldwide phenomena on par with &quot;Star Wars.&quot;<br />Peter Jackson (who reportedly condemns this biography) is a fascinating figure in modern filmmaking. Unfortunately, since this biography is unauthorized and unapproved, Pryor has to stitch together just about every magazine article or press release ever written about Jackson. It's very unsatisfying since all of it has been said before. And the first time around, it didn't sound so.... well, smarmy.<br />Pryor paints Jackson in extreme colors, apparently so his adoration won't seem &quot;fannish.&quot; But it doesn't make Jackson seem like a three-dimensional person. It makes him seem either like a saintly genius, or a creep. His personal life, friendships and interactions with actors aren't really dealt with, which makes him seem a lot more distant than he is. At least there's no dirt-dishing -- Jackson seems to have led a pretty much blameless life.<br />Pryor's writing style leaves something to be desired. He misspells some of Tolkien's words like &quot;uruk-hai&quot; (which he spells &quot;urak-hai&quot;). And Pryor uses overwritten gushing to cover up the book's biggest flaw: He doesn't know what Jackson is like. Pryor only describes his behavior, his words, and what other say about him -- the man himself remains an enigma at the book's end.<br />The saving grace of &quot;Peter Jackson&quot; is how it shows off the impact Jackson has had on his native New Zealand, both as a filmmaker and as a worldwide celebrity. However, this can't gloss over the opportunistic, slightly sneering tone that pervades Pryor's book. If you like Jackson -- as a director and a person -- it will make you squirm.<br />Fans of Peter Jackson may be hungry for more info on this beloved director. But you're better off waiting for the official (and approved) biography by Brian Sibley. Ian Pryor's &quot;Peter Jackson: From Prince of Splatter to Lord of the Rings&quot; has the slippery feeling of a rushed-to-print biography to cash in a filmmaker's fame.itten gushing to cover up the book's biggest flaw: He doesn't know what Jackson is like.

Eight more marriages came after that, including George Sanders, Prince Frederick von Anhalt, and Conrad Hilton (yes, from THAT Hilton family). Not to mention a small army of lovers that included Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Frank Sinatra, and more.<br />Gossipy memoirs are always a fun guilty pleasure, the sort of thing to tuck inside a weekly news magazine at lunch. Gabor reveals plenty of sexy details (including making out with Greta Garbo) that are above and beyond even what tabloids usually print, and she does in it a very straightforward, matter-of-fact manner.<br />Unfortunately, her exploits start to get annoying. The word &quot;diamond&quot; is used constantly (we get it, Zsa Zsa -- you love diamonds), and there is little of Gabor's life except who she slept with and why. There isn't a great deal about her daughter or family... except when ex-hubby George Sanders married her sister Magda. Some of her stories are questionable -- like Sanders wanting to watch Gabor bed a Catholic priest, or Gabor sleeping with Sinatra to make him leave her apartment. And others raise weird questions (if she's so amazingly sexy, why did her husbands keep cheating?).<br />Gabor gushes ad nauseam about her assorted lovers and husbands, few of which are actually around much. Initially, since her first lover was a god-king, it's an interesting tale. But when she gets to Hollywood, these guys mostly start to blur together. What's more, Gabor certainly was telling the truth when she said she liked being around men more than women -- her descriptions of women like Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly and any other beautiful heterosexual actress are pretty catty, to say the least.<br />Zsa Zsa Gabor's autobiography starts off as a delicious gossipfest, but eventually deteriorates into a listing of the men she slept with and/or married. &quot;One Life is Not Enough&quot; is way more than enough.ore than women -- her descriptions of women like Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly and any other beautiful heterosexual actress are pretty catty, to say the least. <br />Zsa Zsa Gabor's autobiography starts off as a delicious gossipfest, but eventually deteriorates into a listing of the men she slept with and/or married. &quot;One Life is Not Enough&quot; is way more than enough.	2004-05-19

Wrong. Wendy Holden misfires badly in &quot;Azur Like It,&quot; a tepid Brit-chick-lit nove. Saddled with an offensively dumb heroine and a boring plot, it has only a few moments of over-the-top color.<br />Kate Clegg toils at her thankless job at the Slackmucklewaite Mercury (known as the &quot;Mockery&quot;) in a small North-English town. She yearns to escape to a real journalism job, but has to be content with small-town stuff for the time being. Things go downhill when megamogul Peter Hardstone buys the Mockery and wrecks what little worth it had. Gone are Kate's dreams of covering the Cannes Film Festival -- all she gets to do is interview witchy reality-TV starlet Champagne D'Vyne.<br />That all changes when Kate encounters Nat Hardstone, the hunky son of her boss. Kate is swept off her feet by the sexy Nat's advances, and most of all by his willingness to get her sent to the Cannes Film Festival. She doesn't notice his shady, manipulative behavior, and ends up in France by herself, abandoned and friendless. But with some friends to help out, she might just salvage her trip...<br />&quot;Azur Like It&quot; is strictly by the numbers chick lit, with a slightly different setting. But a boring plot set in southern France is still boring. Holden tries to spice it all up to make it fun and delicious, but without a solid plotline or much of an idea where it's all going.<br />Holden manages some uproarious kitsch moments, like the description of the Hardstone mansion's &quot;Baroque'n'Roll&quot; interior decoration. But those are offset by the boring, like much of Kate's horrible first days in France. Not to mention the embarrassing: It's hard not to wince when we're treated to a cringeworthy sex scene in a restaurant, involving Nat's big toe.<br />What's more, &quot;Azur Like It&quot; is hideously predictable. It's obvious early on just what a creep Nat is, and that Kate will end up in more trouble if she goes along with him. And her constant parade of misery -- getting her jacket burned off right before the festival -- gets tired after a while.<br />Kate is so blindingly naive and trusting that you may want to club her. Her Goth-y pal Darren is far more likable, and the caricatures -- the flamboyant decorator, the snotty trophy wife -- are the most fun, even if they rarely are more than cardboard cutouts. The most entertaining is certainly Champagne, a horrendously rude, untalented starlet who aspires to be the next Bond girl.<br />Take your average chick-lit book, cut out the plot, add kitsch and an exotic setting, and you have &quot;Azur Like It.&quot; It's pretty at the start, but degenerates into a mass of cliches and purple ceilings.end up in more trouble if she goes along with him.

The sudden disappearance of the jacket, the death of the dog, and the sudden deterioration of Grady's personal life all mesh together...<br />Chabon litters &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; with references to pop culture and high culture, the literati and Marilyn Monroe in the same breath. The result is even smarter than either alone would be. And despite the label of a &quot;cool&quot; writer, Chabon's elegant prose proves that he's more than just a wonder boy.<br />Grady may be suffering from a hideous case of writer's block (although the result is that he actually writes too much), but Chabon clearly wasn't. He manages to grab hold what could have been a horrendously silly caper, and turns it into a wry work of art. His writing is sharp, bright and full of little points like a pinecone.<br />Grady is not a likable guy -- he's a coward, a philanderer, and he's in the throes of a very ugly midlife crisis. But he seems real, and somehow appealing. The flamboyant gay editor Crabtree and the death-obsessed James are nice supporting characters -- Crabtree and Grady are the &quot;wonder boys&quot; of the past, and James is the wonder boy of tomorrow. The supporting cast -- including  a perpetually sozzled author, a sultry transvestite, and a sultry boarder -- add plenty of extra flavor.<br />Clever and incisive, &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; is a vivid look at aging, writing and the academic life.

Now the second volume of this quirky epic is out: &quot;The Hidden Land.&quot; It suffers from a bit of middle-volume syndrome, but it keeps up the pace and builds up suspense and plot for volume three.<br />In the first book of the trilogy, five cousins suddenly got swept away into the Secret Country -- a magical land of wizards, dragons, unicorns, nobles and kings, which they thought they had made up as a game. Now they have taken the parts they set down for themselves, ranging from sorceresses to crown princes -- and a person they never made up has shown up: the mysterious Claudia.<br />Now things take a not-so-unexpected turn, when the kids try to keep the King from being murdered. But the king dies anyhow -- and the question of whodunnit only makes things more complicated. Since he is the crown prince, Ted has to ascend the throne, but since he isn't really Prince Edward, he's uneasy about it. But despite his lack of experience, he must find a way to ready the Hidden Land for war against the Dragon King... even if he dies in the process.<br />Dean jumps headlong back into the story without missing a step. &quot;The Hidden Land,&quot; like its predecessor, takes a lot of basic fantasy elements and whips them together into something fresh. Kids in a fantasy land, wizards, unicorns, evil dark lord, and plenty of other stuff. Don't worry -- Dean's sense of whimsy and mystery carries it through.<br />Her descriptions are detailed but avoid being grandiose. Dean takes the story seriously but doesn't make it pretentious. She also mixes together &quot;ye olde&quot; speak and modern English, keeping the medieval people from sounding like modern Americans, and Americans from sounding like ye olde medieval types. You can't forget that these scared, confused kids are not native to the Secret Country.<br />Ted is perhaps the character who grows the most in this book, since he's struggling to keep afloat as the new King. But all the cousins have become more confident and able. (In a few cases, they act oddly because of their adventures). Some are stronger, some are wiser, and some are just handling the situation well. But they are still portrayed as kids stuck in a fantasy game gone wild.<br />&quot;The Hidden Land&quot; suffers from the awkwardness of being in the middle of the trilogy.

Mix thoroughly, and heat to lukewarm. That's basically the recipe for vicar/author G.P. Taylor's debut novel &quot;Shadowmancer,&quot; a lame and limp semi-spiritual fantasy.<br />Like many a fantasy villain, Obadiah Demurral wants to play God, and the corrupt vicar does so by trafficking with evil powers -- all-out sorcery and devil-worship. Enter Raphah, a mysterious man from Africa who is after a mystery amulet that will be incredibly destructive if evil people get their hands on it. (Wow, that's original)<br />Are our heroes going to let Demurral and the forces of evil win? Of course not. Troubled teen Thomas Barrick (who has quasi-religious visions) and his pal Kate team up with Raphah to somehow keep Demurral from becoming king of the universe with the help of that amulet. But can our heroes win out against Pyratheon (read: the devil)?<br />Original fantasy is hard to come by, and &quot;Shadowmancer&quot; doesn't improve the situation. It's your basic good vs. evil-forces-stirring-up-Armageddon story, with a heavy layer of religious allegory. Taylor manages to dredge up a few interesting mythical creatures, and a solid Yorkshire setting, but they're drowned out by the trite writing.<br />No way is religious fantasy a bad thing in itself -- after all, C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien rooted their stories partly in religion. But Taylor's brand of Christianity is very watered-down, very generic, very politically-correct and VERY preachy. He lays this bland religious goo on so thickly that it's hard to read without feeling twitchy and uncomfortable. &quot;Riathamus [God] stands at the door of your life and knocks. If you hear his call and answer him he will share your life and live with you always,&quot; Raphah announces. It's like he's reading from a pamphlet.<br />Nor can you expect much in the way of character development; everyone is a symbol rather than a person. Demurral is a cackling, mustache-twirling devil-worshiper. Saintly Raphah is as dull as the proverbial ditchwater, and so are the plucky kids who accompany him. There are no shades of grey here. A flawed person either is evil, or he's just waiting to be redeemed.<br />&quot;Shadowmancer&quot; is packaged as a thrilling dark fantasy for kids.

Farrow's autobiography has a sort of wispy appeal, with her stories about life with Frank Sinatra and Andre Previn, but it only comes to life in the last third of the book.<br />Farrow came from a celebrity family and started acting early. It was the cause of her deteriorated brief marriage to legendary singer Frank Sinatra, and new homebody ways didn't save her second marriage to Andre Previn -- but she did adopt many special-needs or orphaned children, alongside her own biological ones. But her sprawling adopted family was imperiled when her longtime boyfriend Woody Allen was found to be having an affair with her adopted daughter.<br />The first two-thirds of &quot;What Falls Away&quot; lacks any real punch. It's low-sugar cotton candy, with Farrow talking about the celebrity life and her time with her two husbands.  And she talks about adopting children, of course -- although as the number goes up, it gets harder and harder to tell them apart.<br />But Farrow's biography starts showing a pulse a third of the way. Her long-term affair with Woody Allen was a bit of a freakshow, and it's only when it comes to Allen that Farrow starts to show any passion of any kind -- good, bad, or just passionate. She tries to hold back her obvious -- and justifiable -- anger, but it seeps through the ink.<br />Unfortunately, as &quot;What Falls Away&quot; starts to show signs of life, Farrow's own portrait of herself unravels. It comes across as alarming that she was merely worried by Allen's bizarre behavior toward Dylan, a young girl he sexually abused. And that after finding explicitly pornographic photographs of her adopted daughter, Farrow went back to work with Allen. Yet Farrow seems helpless to stop Allen from doing anything. She couldn't even throw him out of her apartment -- her son had to do it.<br />Farrow's writing is wisp-thin and sort of vaguely new-agey, especially when she writes about her transcendental trips with the Beatles back in the sixties. It's not that good, but it's pleasant enough. Virtually everyone is painted in rosy hues, save Allen (who is painted a sort of slimy sludge color) and Soon-Yi (Farrow obviously doesn't know what her daughter is thinking). In fact, it's hard to tell what Farrow herself is thinking -- she only seems to skim the top of her feelings.<br />Mia Farrow doesn't exactly bare her soul in &quot;What Falls Away.&quot; What she does do is expose Woody Allen, and a life that mixes the disquieting and the impressive.y new-agey, especially when she writes about her transcendental trips with the Beatles back in the sixties.

Artist of many shades Viggo Mortensen did for the epic movie trilogy &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; and like many other visitors was struck by the beauty and warmth of this little island country. And as an accompaniment to exhibitions in Massey University and the Wellington City Gallery, he presents &quot;Mo Te Upoko-O-Te-Ika/For Wellington.&quot;<br />Mortensen often presents hauntingly everyday photos, but in &quot;Mo Te Upoko-O-Te-Ika/For Wellington,&quot; he shifted toward the abstract. &quot;Erfoud 17&quot; presents a spray of flowers in a shimmery orb, while &quot;Plimmerton&quot; gives us silvery streaks across the darkness. The &quot;Lost&quot; photographs were taken as Mortensen tried to use the flash as a light source. (Waste not, want not)<br />These pictures are bold sweeps of vivid color, almost looking neon at times -- golden whirlpools against a dark backdrop, two glowing expanses of greenish-gold and electric blue clashing. It's like looking at the aurora borealis through night vision goggles. Color and light are the strongest elements in these pictures, and the effect is subtle and primal.<br />Poetry, paint, film and photograph are the big sweeping canvas that Mortensen has painted his art on, and he's in excellent form in &quot;Me To Upoko-O-Te-Ika/For Wellington.&quot; Fluid, shimmering and thoroughly enticing.	2004-05-14

But most of them, like &quot;Les Passementeries Horribles&quot; (in which embroidery and tassels act ominous) or &quot;The Prune People&quot; (which is pictures of people with prunes for heads) are amusing even if they make no sense.<br />Edward Gorey's delicate pen-and-ink illustrations would be fun even if he didn't possess the morbid whimsy that fills almost every story. Okay, if you are easily offended, then the &quot;Loathsome Couple&quot; will offend you with a pair of crazy killers lure, photograph and murder small children (&quot;They spent the better part of the night murdering the child in various ways&quot;). But he did so in the best of bad taste.<br />His slightly warped sensibilities were also shown in the chilly skies and barren-looking outdoors, cute children and haughty adults in Victorian attire. There are occasional splashes of color (like the blue backdrops of &quot;L'heure Bleue&quot;), but even then it tends to be a bit eerie and faded like old photographs.<br />The eerie whimsy of Edward Gorey's work is alive and well in &quot;Amphigorey Also.&quot; A few of the works are duds, but overall it's a strange and wonderful ride.ot;Amphigorey Also.&quot; A few of the works are duds, but overall it's a strange and wonderful ride.	2004-05-12

So Masklin is following the instructions of the Thing (a computer who is smarter than all the other characters put together) and going on a secret mission with Angalo and the Abbot to Florida.<br />After they sneak aboard the Concorde, freak out the stewardess and hijack the plane, the nomes learn that none other than Richard Arnold (grandson of Arnold Bros, founder of The Store) is on board. Now they must somehow send the Thing into space, so it can contact the spaceship and whisk the nomes away. Easy? No way.<br />Technically, anybody who has read the end of &quot;Diggers&quot; will know exactly what will happen in &quot;Wings.&quot; But like flying on the Concorde, it's the ride that's half the thrill. &quot;Wings&quot; is a little tighter and funnier than its predecessors, partly because it  has a much smaller cast -- the small bickering trio, plus the Thing. It doesn't get much better than that.<br />The nomes are fun protagonists, partly because they're so likably naive about the world in general. If they were left alone, they would probably produce a cute little civilization, and their naivete produces plenty of entertaining humor (Concerning the sound barrier: &quot;All right, own up. Who broke it?&quot;). Pratchett manages to make us laugh with the nomes, not at that.<br />The long-suffering Masklin has a new slew of problems the moment he leaves, ranging from the Thing refusing to talk to him to Angalo razzing the stewardesses. Atheistic Angalo and the abbot just avoid biting out each other's throat. But it's the Thing's dry, superior guidance that really steals the show.<br />Pratchett brings his Bromeliad trilogy to a close full of action, suspense, and frogs.

With detailed writing and nuanced, likable characters, this is a modern fantasy classic.<br />&quot;Sabriel&quot; is the story of a teenage girl living happily at a girl's school, while her necromancer father (the Abhorsen) roams around putting the dead to rest. All that changes when a sending brings her father's sword and bells, meaning that he is dead or incapacitated. So Sabriel takes on her father's duties... and the specter of a horrible evil creature that is reaching out from death to snare her.<br />&quot;Lirael&quot; takes us to the cold citadel of the Clayr, a race of seers. Young Lirael is depressed because she doesn't have the gift of Sight yet, even though everybody else her age does. But things take a sinister turn when she sets a horrifying, bloodthirsty creature loose, and must work (with the help of the mysterious Disreputable Dog) to get rid of it. But what Lirael doesn't know is that the outside world is in danger too -- from a new evil threat.<br />&quot;Abhorsen&quot; brings the series to an explosive conclusion. Lirael and her nephew Sameth (along with &quot;cat&quot; Mogget and the Disreputable Dog) are in danger from the Dead. What's more, the Destroyer Orannis has escaped from his prison and is being assisted by an evil necromancer and the Dead called Chlorr -- and a pal of Sameth's. Now Lirael has to stop the Destroyer before he... well, destroys all life in the world.<br />The Abhorsen Trilogy is a perfect example of dark fantasy, with its grotesque dead, magical bells, enchanted and shadowy beasties. It takes the trappings of high fantasy and lets us see them through a mirror darkly. Not to mention that the characters are likable -- especially the gutsy Sabriel -- and the acid-tongued animals and black humor add a wry spin to the fantasy stories. &quot;Lirael&quot; is a bit limper than the first and third books, since it takes a long time to get going, but it's still a worthy and spellbinding book.<br />Garth Nix's Abhorsen Trilogy is a thrilling fantasy epic, and not to be missed by anyone who enjoys a little chill down their spine.

Now Colbert produces &quot;The Magical Worlds of Lord of the Rings,&quot; with its insights into the literature, legend, and religion behind &quot;Lord of the Rings.<br />Colbert does a fairly good job of giving us insights into the myths (Norse legends), literature (&quot;Beowulf,&quot; the book &quot;Babbitt,&quot; Shakespeare's influence on faeries and elves), religion (the source of Galadriel: Mary, mother of Jesus), and Tolkien's own opinions at the time (industrialization destroying the beautiful countryside where he grew up).<br />Colbert makes some rather obvious errors (usually linked with the &quot;Silmarillion&quot; rather than &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;), but nothing too awful. Overall he does a pretty good job of addressing common questions like &quot;How Many Languages Did Tolkien Invent?&quot;, &quot;Who Was Tolkien's First Dark Lord?&quot; or &quot;How Did Orcs Get So Ugly?&quot;. He writes breezily and conversationally, as if addressing a bunch of listeners.<br />Does &quot;Magical Worlds&quot; stand above other Tolkien guides? Nah. It's a pretty good guide for entry-level fans, but long-time fans will already know much of this material. However, fans who are new to Middle-Earth and who don't know a lot of the background will probably find this invaluable.

Her musical memoir, &quot;Baby Plays Around: A Love Affair, with Music&quot; takes on the internal workings of a rising little band.<br />Freelance writer Helene Stapinski wanted the play the drums since she was a little girl, so she jumped at the chance to join I Hate Jane with two other women (and briefly roped her new husband into helping out). The band becomes unbalanced when Elizabeth leaves in a huff, and a pair of men join the group. But then things smooth out, and things appear to be going well.<br />Professionally, that is. One day Helene's husband comes to her and admits that &quot;baby's been playing around&quot; with some little tart at his newsroom. Unsurprisingly, Helene is enraged, and the searing fights and all-out brawls seem to show that their marriage is doomed. So Helene buries herself in Stephonic (&quot;I Hate Jane&quot;'s new name) and plays the drums like never before...<br />Not everybody can say they have relationship advice from Elvis Costello. And that weirdly intimate chapter where Elvis saves Stapinski's foundering marriage is one of the best in the entire book. Overall, she does an excellent job of bringing the band life to the readers -- the good (musical highs), the bad (internal tension), and the ugly (Stapinski being fired for no good reason).<br />Stapinski's writing is pleasant and descriptive, like a novel. A very you-are-there feel. And her humor is likably self-deprecating: when thinking about how she has no cool indie music in her CD collection, she thinks &quot;Bless me Elizabeth, for I have sinned I just purchased the new Sting album.&quot; That is, until she remembers the wonderful band Yo La Tengo.<br />That isn't to say that Stapinski's writing is all fun. Her relevelations about her disintegrating marriage are heartbreaking. And there's some understandable bitterness toward the vaguely stalker-like newsroom tart, and a lesser amount toward band frontwoman/singer Julie, who apparently considered herself queen of all she surveyed onstage.<br />Helene Stapinski draws readers into a crazy quilt of glittering clubs, Inuit towns and the heart of New York City. &quot;Baby Plays Around,&quot; and a what a tune she plays in here.here's some understandable bitterness toward the vaguely stalker-like newsroom tart, and a lesser amount toward band frontwoman/singer Julie, who apparently considered herself queen of all she surveyed onstage.<br />Helene Stapinski draws readers into a crazy quilt of glittering clubs, Inuit towns and the heart of New York City. &quot;Baby Plays Around,&quot; and a what a tune she plays in here.	2004-05-10

In the third collection of movie art, Gary Russell introduces us to the images and models that helped Middle-Earth come alive, and the excellent people behind them.<br />&quot;Return of the King&quot; introduces us to new civilizations, new monsters, and lots of new enemies and allies -- even more than &quot;Two Towers&quot; did. So the concept art ranges from armor and clothing (Faramir's regal armor, the Haradrim, Eowyn's masculine disguise, the archaic &quot;Dead&quot; armor), the perfect pirate ships, different kinds of Mumakil (prehistoric elephants), weaponry (different sketches of the Grond battering ram), and monsters like the hideous spider Shelob, whose sketches take up a full six pages.<br />On a more sweeping scale, there are full-fledged paintings, mattes, models and special effects shots.  Among the artists are the excellent Alan Lee and John Howe, who both paint and sketch their usual beautiful material. Jeremy Bennett also does a good job, although his stuff is substantially rougher. As for models? Try the ghoulish head of the dead king, different Fell Beast models, the Mumakil, and much more.<br />It's nice to see the concept art in all its stages. For example, one Witch-King sketch from 1996 shows (Ben Wootten apologetically says) D&amp;D-influenced armor. At the same time, an early sketch of Gandalf confronting one of the Black Riders is shown in nearly identical form in the finished movie. Okay, Pippin isn't there -- but the pose and setting are similar.<br />The comments from the many artists also give a greater insight into how the various things in the film evolved. Some things (like battering ram Grond) were pretty thoroughly described in the original novel. With other things, like the Fell Beast, the concept artists had to be a little more creative. So it's intriguing to see how their designs shifted and changed, ranging from the grotesque to the silly to the final designs used in the movie.<br />&quot;The Art of Return of the King&quot; is a good insight into the making of the epic film, and the concept art behind everything from spiders to siege towers.

Debra Weinstein's debut novel is a brilliant, multilayered look at the world of poetry and the people who populate it. Funny and yet strangely lyrical, &quot;Apprentice To The Flower Poet Z&quot; is a lovely read.<br />Student and wannabe-poet Annabelle Goldsmith stumbles into a dream job when she becomes the &quot;apprentice&quot; (read: assistant with a more glamorous title) to Z., a famed poet who writes poetry about flowers. Among Annabelle's duties is buying ink, trespassing for flower desciptions, and buying a boyfriend's underwear for the charming, enigmatic Z. Vaguely she knows that all this is awful, but she  submits meekly anyway.<br />Annnabelle also takes up with an older student, Harry, who enmeshes her in some weird erotic situations to serve as his muse. Then Annabelle meets Z's husband and sullen daughter Claire, both of whom hide more unflattering secrets about this glamorous poet. But Annabelle discovers the most shocking fact about Z yet -- and it's tied to Annabelle's own budding poetry.<br />&quot;I want the world to think poetry, the way it thinks television...&quot; So says Spence, Z's sexy boyfriend. That may be a bit much to ask, but Weinstein certainly makes the world of modern poetry -- either beautiful or ruthless -- closer to readers in this book. While there are a few subplots that seem to peter out (like the story of Harry's mentor, or Annabelle's shrink sessions), the main plot is the mesmerizing one.<br />Weinstein herself is a poet, and it shows. She has a sort of spare poetry to her prose writing, a bit like a prose haiku -- minimal details, but still evocative.

Tolkien, and the tepid collection &quot;Halflings, Hobbits, Warrows and Weefolk&quot; seems to back that up. A few stories are entertaining, but most are poorly written or hideously plotted. (An eagle called King Cumulonimbus? Please, wake me from this nightmare...)<br />A tale of troll invasion kicks off the volume (Mickey Zucker Reichart's &quot;The Eranis Pipe&quot;) followed by plodding, dialogue-heavy tales (Jody Lynn Nye's father-and-daughter &quot;Moon Shadow&quot; and Judith Moffet's leaden &quot;Origin of the Hob&quot;), and the ghastly R.A. Salvatore story &quot;A Sparkle For Homer,&quot; which involves an idiot halfling in a giant's castle. Charles de Lint's otherworldly story is good, but seems out of place.<br />The saving graces of this volume are stories by Craig Shaw Gardner (&quot;A Fumbling of Fairies&quot;) and John Dalmas (&quot;The Stoor's Map&quot;). The first involves the adventures of the sneezing wizard Ebenezum and his hapless apprentice, while the second is the story of a halfling elopement that runs into some serious spider trouble.<br />The title is a bit misleading -- only one story dares to refer to hobbits (the story called &quot;Hobbits,&quot; which starts off promising but ends grotesquely). And no stories refer to Dennis McKiernan's Warrows; probably the name was included just to make the title snappy. The standard &quot;wee folk&quot; tend to loosely fit the hobbit mold, but with too many magic spells and too few brains.<br />Most of the stories are overwritten and unnatural-sounding (enough about wiggling toes already!), and the characters tend to be dull and over-talkative. What's more, some of the authors are sufficiently unimaginative that they cobble bits from J.R.R. Tolkien's work, most notably hobbit holes and the name &quot;Bracegirdle.&quot;<br />If readers are desperately hungry for hobbits, this might make you happy for a little while.

That much is evident if you check out just a few Norse legends, with their gods and dwarves and elves and so forth. But in investigating the legends that lead up to &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; David Day goes wide of the mark.<br />He describes the legends about rings and ancient civilizations, dating back to the earliest recorded history. He dips into legends from all times -- the Celts, Arthurian legend, the Norse legends of gods, elves, dwarves and human heroes, the opera &quot;Ring of the Nibelung,&quot; and many others. He includes synopses, analysis, and plenty of speculation.<br />So what does this have to do with Tolkien? Not much, unfortunately. Day flounders in just about every ring-related legend he can find, and cobbles mythical material from every mythology he can get his hands on. Filler makes up most of this . Just because a legend has a ring doesn't mean it's in any way connected to &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; or that they are in any way the roots of Tolkien's Ring saga.<br />As a result, this book is a crazy quilt that will drive Tolkien fans nuts. Tolkien famously drew on Norse and Anglo-Saxon legends for his books, but not a lot else. Arthurian legend (a sketchy source itself) is cited too heavily, as is Celtic legend. What does the Celtic ogre Balor have to do with Sauron? Uh, well, they both have one eye... they're powerful... they're evil... bingo! says Day. Connection made.<br />Day's scholarly ramblings also have a lot to be desired. He paraphrases things from &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; without telling readers that he is doing so, and offers his speculation as unadorned fact. He even stoops to trashing Christianity despite Tolkien's devout beliefs. Even legends are misquoted, such as his half-made-up descriptions of the silver horse Grani. No sources, no citations. Those familiar with the background of Tolkien's work will be incensed, and those who aren't familiar will be grossly misled.<br />The saving grace of Day's book is Alan Lee's exceptional artwork, which is elegant and magical as always. But even Lee's wonderful pictures cannot save a fetid, self-important volume with more fiction than fact.will be grossly misled.<br />The saving grace of Day's book is Alan Lee's exceptional artwork, which is elegant and magical as always.

Taking the three concepts behind the French flag (liberty, equality and fraternity), Kieslowski created a colorful, emotional masterwork.<br />In &quot;Blue,&quot; Julie loses her composer husband and her young daughter in a horrible car crash. Enveloped in her grief, she leaves her country mansion and takes a small apartment in Paris. But the haunting memory of her husband's music -- and the love of his former coworker -- keep drawing her back to her old life.<br />In &quot;White,&quot; Polish immigrant (and born loser) Karol Karol is divorced by his sexy, ruthless wife Dominique. She takes all his money, his home, sleeps around and rubs it in his face, and leaves him penniless in the street. But Karol turns the tables on his beautiful Dominique when he becomes a rich man, and begins to spin an elaborate plot against her.<br />In &quot;Red,&quot; the warm-hearted model Valentine accidently runs over a pregnant German shepherd. She takes the dog to its owner, but finds that he's a cold-hearted, callous ex-judge who uses a radio to spy on his neighbors. Valentine's disgust prompts the judge to turn himself in, and a strange friendship is struck between the embittered old man and the idealistic model... one that will change both their lives.<br />Obviously, reading the scripts for the Three Colors Trilogy can't quite recreate the experience of actually watching the film. The characters -- especially Julie and Valentine -- don't seem as rich without Juliette Binoche and Irene Jacob. And what words can recreate the swell of shimmering violins whenever Julie fades out? But Kieslowski's screenplays hint at the splendor and grandeur of his visions for these films. He brings the words to life in a way that few screenwriters can, and his descriptions of the characters and how they look, act, feel is phenomenal.<br />The Three Colors Trilogy is a modern classic of cinema, with its haunting characters and beautiful direction.

And what if renovations and pollution made them sick? This goofy tale of a cute ghost, a conscientious schoolboy, and a bunch of freaky spooks is an amusing light read, even with its preachy passages.<br />Humphrey the Horrible is a ghost -- a cute, light, pinkish ghost, son of a Hag and a legless Scottish ghost. He and his family live in a ruined castle... but all that changes when headless Aunt Hortensia arrives, having been forced out of her old home. Soon all the ghosts are homeless, and looking for a ghastly new place to dwell. They end up spending the night at a boy's dormitory, and enlisting the help of one of the boys there, Rick.<br />A plan is formed: Rick can go ask the Prime Minister to help find a &quot;ghost sanctuary.&quot; When they arrive in London (with a water spirit, family of vampire bats and mad monk they picked up), Rick manages to argue the ghosts' case, and get them a hideous old castle. But their new home may be even more dangerous than the old one -- and could destroy all the spooks of England.<br />Don't expect anything too deep from Eva Ibbotson, and you'll be satisfied. Few people can actually write light fantasy, and her flair for the grotesque (the Shuk, a one-eyed disfigured dog, or playing games with Aunt Hortensia's head) adds to the goofiness of it all.<br />Ibbotson's writing is quirky and full of entertaining puns and poignant moments. Not to mention that over-the-top British style, with an almost conversational feel and plenty of icky moments. The book sags about halfway through, with some rather preachy stretches about vegetarianism and pollution. But when the exorcists show up and the witches are enlisted, things kick back into high gear.<br />Humphrey is reminiscent of the white witch from &quot;Which Witch?&quot; -- he's supposed to be grotesque, but ends up being cuddly. Rick comes across as a much more solid character, especially when he saves the life of a baby vampire bat. And the other ghosts are a motley bunch, with their own unique complaints and quirks (Humphrey's brother utters bloodcurdling shrieks).<br />&quot;The Great Ghost Rescue&quot; is a fun light fantasy, dripping with humor and ectoplasm.

Tolkien, the Silmarillion. But &quot;The Gods of Pegana&quot; (first published in 1905) got to that turf first, with the littler gods under an overseeing deity (MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI -- isn't that a great name?) who made all of them, the lush language and complex histories. It's not hard to see why Tolkien was a fan of Dunsany's.<br />Dunsany seems to have been having a good time creating his own myths and legends. But even so, there's a feeling of melancholy to &quot;The Gods of Pegana,&quot; and the sense that even at the beginning of the world, things are headed straight for the apocalyptic end. There's little of Dunsany's humor and irony in these stories, though his semi-mythic, descriptive language is very much present (&quot;... then shine the blue eyes of the gods like sunlight on the sea, where each god sits upon his mountain.&quot;)<br />Before the Silmarillion, there was &quot;The Gods of Pegana.&quot; This enticing early fantasy is a wonderful example of the invented myth, and a good read for fans of the classic fantasies.	2004-05-05

She's Holly Golightly without the baggage and the hick ex-husband -- smart, funny, sexy and sympathetic. She's also the subject of &quot;The Fabulous Girl's Guide to Decorum,&quot; an amusing but unbalanced mix of tongue-in-cheek goofing and etiquette lessons.<br />Kim Izzo and Ceri Marsh take a look at the life of the Fabulous Girl (hereafter called &quot;FG&quot;): Her career (how to dress for job interviews, how to deal with low-dignity &quot;Jill Jobs&quot;), society (the noveau riche, when to applaud), friendship, sex and dating (why you should not date a rocker), couplehood, weddings and divorce (on eloping: &quot;Remember, there's nothing more chic than running away and coming back married&quot;), and how to entertain.<br />If chick-lit came in nonfiction form, this would be it. Lots of stuff about love lives, pals (male and female) and jobs, with cutesy codewords (&quot;Jill Job&quot; is a I-do-it-just-for-the-money job). And it's definitely not Miss Manners. There's less focus on which fork to use than there is on proper workplace manners, or how to support your buddies.<br />Hidden under the froth are some genuinely good tips. Izzo and Marsh give plenty of pointers about how to conduct yourself with sophistication and style, even in an embarrassing situation. They also draw out the lines when it comes to chivalry (how should a guy help a woman into a cab?) and little details for the 21st century like when it's rude to talk on a cell phone.<br />That isn't to say that &quot;Guide&quot; has its Manolo-shod feet on the ground. The chapter on sleeping with one's boss made me squirm, as did anything having to do with flings and the obnoxious &quot;Bingo.&quot; What's more, the description of FGs as being &quot;smart&quot; didn't quite fit in, since the sort of chic urban life they talk about seems to require &quot;savvy&quot; rather than &quot;smarts.&quot;<br />&quot;The Fabulous Girl's Guide To Decorum&quot; is a bit confused as to whether it's an etiquette guide or a tongue-in-cheek nonfiction chick-lit.

If the subject is already interesting, then Mortensen's photographs are outright fascinating. Mortensen's &quot;Miyelo&quot; is a photography book that is more than just a book, but an experience.<br />&quot;Miyelo&quot; is a collection of photographs focusing on the Lakota Ghost Dance, a recreation of a dance first performed in South Dakota in the late 1800s. Along with these photographs are more items related to the Ghost Dance -- Mortensen's own words, essays by experts of all stripes, chants, and quotations from everybody from Mark Twain to Crazy Horse to Lao-Tze.<br />&quot;Miyelo&quot; is one of those books that leaves you a bit dizzy after you've finished it. Mortensen shot the photographs for this book while filming the movie &quot;Hildago&quot; in the California desert. The result is surreal but extremely effective, almost like a vision of the past.<br />Mortensen's photography is never more entrancing than it is here. Just about every photo is shimmering and blurred, like a hallucination or a mirage. It gives the entire book the quality of a dream set on paper. &quot;Miyelo 15&quot; features a Lakota man standing in front of a shimmering desert landscape, while &quot;Miyelo 5&quot; shows only a series of transparent figures that seem to be moving. Living up to the name of the dance, these people look like ghosts.<br />Accompanying the photographs are Mortensen's foreword (which reads almost like poetry): &quot;After one of the dryest summers in memory, nearly all green had bled from the landscape, leaving cottonwood bark tatter and twig tip as grey as reflected dawn on the creek; pale as wrist scar, frost grass, clay cut bank and barely there clouds running for cover to the Black Hills.&quot;<br />But as wonderful as the essays and foreword are, it's Viggo Mortensen's dreamlike photography that makes this book truly unforgettable.

What if her charge's parents were moneyed but insensitive, treating their child like a pet? The answer is &quot;The Nanny Diaries,&quot; an amusing and sometimes poignant chunk of high-level chic-lit.<br />Nanny is a student at NYU with a teeny apartment, but unfortunately she can't handle the money thang. So she's interviewed by wealthy Mrs. X as a potential nanny for her only son Grayer (poor kid), and is eventually accepted. Her duties include French lessons, stomach bugs, walks in the park, feeding Grayer, and so on. What Nanny didn't count on was being summoned in mid-vacation, serving as Mrs. X's fashion consultant, being heckled for her job, and attending Mommy &amp; Me meetings with all the other nannies.<br />What's even worse, Nanny soon learns that not all is well with the X family, and not just because Grayer is treated like a pet. Mr. X is obviously having an affair (with the &quot;Chicago&quot; woman) and their marriage is starting to split at the seams. Now Nanny must perform above and beyond the call of duty -- valiantly keeping herself and Grayer from being scarred for life.<br />Since both Nicola Kraus and Emma McLaughlin once were nannies, it's not surprising that they take some not-so-good-natured revenge on the royalty of Manhattan. The job is hell, and only a masochist would like it. Her Christmas present from this moneyed bunch? Earmuffs. But they manage to keep their revenge from running away from them, never turning this into an unfunny former-boss roast.<br />There's nothing too surprising in &quot;Nanny Diaries,&quot; but it's an entertaining ride. Kraus and McLaughlin deftly juggle the absurd and compassionate viewpoints. Their satire pokes straight through the idle rich and makes them bleed. About halfway through &quot;Nanny Diaries,&quot; the plot seems to sag -- yes, we know Mrs. X is a pain in the butt with her crazy demands! We get it! -- but revs back up when the X family starts to disintegrate.<br />Kraus and McLaughlin are actually excellent character writers. Even the excruciating Mrs. X has a human side and feelings, and Grayer (however much aggravation he causes Nanny) is the most sympathetic person in the whole book. Nanny herself is a fun character, keeping all her frustrations inside and letting rip at toys.<br />&quot;Nanny Diaries&quot; is a pleasant beach read, amusing chick-lit that helped spawn the I-hate-my-job-and-my-boss-is-evil books.

Nevertheless, they show Jones' particular brand of charm and cuteness, focusing on ordinary everyday things that become infused with magic -- and some very annoying houseguests.<br />In &quot;Chair Person,&quot; the family has just decided to get rid of a hideous old chair when bustling Aunt Christa arrives with a used conjurer's set. Her experiments in magic have an unexpected effect when the chair transforms into Chair Person, who is clumsy, stupid, gluttonous, and who recites commercials constantly. How can Simon and Marcia deal with Chair Person?<br />&quot;Four Grannies&quot; draws on the attitudes of bossy elderly types.

But when one of the grannies gives him a  a chopstick that happens to be magical, the prayer machine causes some unique mayhem...<br />&quot;Who Got Rid of Angus Filch?&quot; features Angus Filch, the houseguest of your nightmares. His wife threw him out, and now his old college buddy's family can see why: He's controlling, obnoxious, complains constantly, torments the dog, jeers at the furniture, watches raunchy TV shows, never pays, grabs the kids by their hair to punish them, and gets up in the middle of the night to set fire to his supposedly contaminated sheets.  But the kids of the family receive unexpected help -- from some very angry furniture.<br />Diana Wynne Jones is in excellent form here; readers who don't like short stories may still like these.  The characters are all delightfully realistic, from the reclusive wannabe inventor to the nightmarish grandmothers who don't want kids in the bathroom too long, lest they become &quot;peculiar.&quot; All sorts of hilarious situations arise, such as Emily (&quot;Four Grannies&quot;) becoming sickening pious, or Chair Person regaling a church group with the fate of the wildebeest.<br />As these are all earlier short stories of Jones', ranging from the mid-1970s to late 1980s, they aren't very detailed as some of her current books.

Now &quot;Wonder Tales&quot; compiles two of his best short story collections, with their exotic fairy tales ranging from the comic to macabre.<br />&quot;The Book of Wonder&quot; is a mix of all kinds of fantasy tales: a pair of dueling idols; a man whose interest in his imaginary land eclipses the real world; a magical window that shows amazing things; suitors try to make a cold queen cry; the story of the Gibbelins, who eat &quot;nothing less good than man&quot;; and of Miss Cubbins and the Dragon of Romance.<br />&quot;Time and the Gods&quot; is a radically different kind of story. Ever read the Silmarillion? Dunsany jumps into similar turf with his invented legends of gods and heroes, such as the story of Time and how it overthrew even what the gods favored, how Inzana lost her golden ball (an enchanting little sun legend), the meeting between Night and Morning, and the tale of Slid, an upstart young god.<br />Dunsany's fantasies aren't as vibrantly realistic as J.R.R. Tolkien's, or as pensive as C.S. Lewis's. Instead they're like fantastical, melancholy little paintings. Some are whimsical (&quot;Miss Cubbins,&quot; &quot;Chu-Bu and Sheemish&quot;), while others are majestic and mythic, like the entire &quot;Time and the Gods&quot; book.<br />Dunsany's writing is lush and descriptive, but in the slightly distant style of the late nineteenth/early twentieth century. He handled comedy, tragedy, horror, and made-up legends with skill and imagination. Not to mention that his mythmaking -- one of the earliest examples of a fictional mythology -- is astoundingly realistic and beautifully made.<br />&quot;Wonder Tales&quot; is an excellent collection of some of Dunsany's best short stories.

Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, but he does have the distinction of being one of the first fantasy writers in history. &quot;In The Land of Time: And Other Fantasy Tales&quot; is a collection of various stories he wrote, drawing from all of Dunsany's writing.<br />Among the longish (none of Dunsany's stories is really long) is Dunsany's short novel &quot;Gods of Pegana,&quot; a collection of Dunsany's invented myths for countries that never really existed, and the novella &quot;Sword of Welleran,&quot; in which legends come to life, including the famed sword of a hero. Not to mention a vast variety of short stories ranging from murder mysteries (&quot;Two Bottles of Relish&quot;) to Victorian character study (&quot;Thirteen At Table&quot;), from horror (the creepy &quot;Ghosts&quot;) to whimsical fantasy (&quot;The Wonderful Window,&quot; the centaur-themed &quot;Bride of the Man-Horse&quot;).<br />One of the good things about &quot;In The Land of Time&quot; is that except for Dunsany's war stories and club tales, just about every kind of fiction he wrote is in here. Fantasy, horror, regular fiction and invented myths -- this guy wrote 'em all. And editor S.T. Joshi does a pretty good job pulling together some of the best things Dunsany wrote. The main problem is that the collection is kind of serious. Since Dunsany could be very funny in some stories, this is leaving a big gap in the collection.<br />Like the fantasy writers who came after him, Dunsany dipped into myths that weren't his own (like &quot;Charon,&quot; a memorable short story about the ferryman of the dead). At the same time, he wove his own legends and myths about gods and heroes, in a vaguely Middle-Eastern setting. If you didn't know better, you could almost believe that these legends were really from some crumbled desert city. And his slightly formal, sparklingly lush language only adds to this feeling.<br />&quot;In the Land of Time: And Other Fantasy Tales&quot; is a solid collection that shows nearly all of Lord Dunsany's considerable writing range.

When Masklin ventures off to the mysterious Florida, to find the descendent of Arnold Bros., a fanatic called Nisodemus takes the opportunity to rally the nomes in rebellion. Just then, Dorcas (a sort of nome technogeek) reveals the Cat (a bulldozer), which might help them against the humans.<br />Terry Pratchett seems to have found more solid footing in &quot;Diggers.&quot; The book feels a lot steadier and surer, now that he's established the groundwork. He weaves in a little subtle social commentary (particularly on religious fanatics); it's not as subtle as it could be, but it isn't too annoying.<br />&quot;Diggers&quot; is also faster-moving than &quot;Truckers.&quot; His sense of quirky humor (like the idea of Florida being made of orange juice) is present constantly, but he doesn't do it in a mean-spirited way. You laugh with the innocent nomes, not at them. Probably the biggest problem is that &quot;Diggers&quot; ends on a cliffhanger of sorts, with the line &quot;I'd very much like to know what Masklin has been doing these past few weeks.&quot;<br />Masklin and the Thing aren't present for most of the story; they show up again in the third book, &quot;Wings.&quot; So most of the focus is on Grimma, the girl Masklin wants to marry, and Dorcas the nome technogeek. Their characters are well-drawn, and their struggles to deal with the fanatical nome is tense and well-plotted.<br />While it's not his best work, Terry Pratchett is in good form in the second book of the Bromeliad trilogy. &quot;Diggers&quot; is a good return for the nomes, and a fun fantasy read.ey show up again in the third book, &quot;Wings.&quot; So most of the focus is on Grimma, the girl Masklin wants to marry, and Dorcas the nome technogeek.

But he struck out in &quot;Woman in the Dark,&quot; a tepid novella that originally appeared in &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine before vanishing for twenty years. Since this will be interesting only to Hammett completists, maybe it should have stayed lost.<br />A lovely young woman stumbles to a smalll house with an injured foot. It turns out the inhabitant of the house is Brazil, an ex-criminal who did time for killing a man in a brawl. A thug arrives to bring the girl, Luise, back to the man she is living with -- except Brazil punches him out. Now they're both in trouble... and in danger... and on the lam.<br />&quot;Woman in the Dark&quot; isn't a particularly thrilling thriller. Hammett's heart didn't seem to be in this tale; it's slow and wandering, and the grand showdown is somehow anticlimactic. What's more, it's very rushed -- it almost feels like Hammett scribbled it out with the intent of expanding it into a full-length novel.<br />Hammett's gritty, somewhat minimalist writing is a little awkward this time around. &quot;One of the men pulled off his cap -- it was a gray tweed, matching his topcoat -- and...&quot; is only one example of the unusually choppy style. But his sense of atmosphere is still unparalleled, with all the grime, grease and smoke of his urban backdrop.<br />The characterizations are sketchy at best. Brazil is much like Hammett's other anti-heroes, with a tough-guy attitude over some very intense feelings. Love interest Luisa is a walking paper doll, a typical exotic kept woman who falls for our anti-hero -- although it's never quite clear why they do fall in love.<br />&quot;Woman in the Dark&quot; is an unusually flat, sketchy novel by a classic mystery author. One of Hammett's few misfires, this is a curiosity but nothing worth getting excuted about.	2004-04-30

This warped coming-of-age tale is shown in its original screenplay format here.<br />Igby has flunked out of virtually every prep school his elite, rich family has sent him to. Now he's being sent to military school -- but he has no intention of staying. So he flees to the heart of New York, living in the loft where his godfather's mistress lives and hanging around with a beautiful college bohemian called Sookie. But Igby's life begins to unravel when his secret is found out, and Sookie falls in love with his brother.<br />Burr Steers certainly had a good thing going when he wrote &quot;Igby Goes Down.&quot; It's a bit hard to follow if you haven't watched the film, since the movie has only a vague sort of plot. But Steers keeps it interesting with lots of witty dialogue and intricate details (he even describes what kind of shirt Sookie should wear in one scene). It's hard to believe that this was his first screenplay -- the end result is that polished.<br />That isn't to say that the screenplay really comes alive by itself. Without the vibrant sullenness of Kieran Culkin, Igby seems a lot less interesting and sympathetic, and Ollie seems much less cold without Ryan Phillipe's deadpan performance. And there are some scenes (like a freakish dream Igby has about Mimi) that never made it to the screen.<br />Adding to the interest is a series of black-and-white stills from the movie, and some production notes at the back. The notes include the origins of &quot;Igby Goes Down,&quot; information on Steers, and what the actors have to say about their characters. It makes for interesting reading.<br />Lovers of teen rebels will probably like &quot;Igby Goes Down,&quot; and people who loved the film will enjoy getting a behind-the-scenes look at the screenplay and production.nplay and production.	2004-04-29

J.R.R. Tolkien created the vast backdrop of his Middle-Earth over the course of his life -- except that mythology evolved as time went on. Now the first batch of his old notes, drafts and rewrites are compiled in &quot;Book of Lost Tales.&quot;<br />It presents some of the material from Tolkien's &quot;Silmarillion&quot;... except that these stories are different. In the tradition of some old Norse myths, the story is told to a human mariner called Eriol. Eriol makes his way to Tol Eressea, an island full of Elves, and is told about their history -- the Ainur, the creation of the world, and many other stories.<br />Some parts of &quot;Book of Lost Tales&quot; are almost indistinguishable from the stories in &quot;Silmarillion.&quot; Others are drastically different: at some points Tolkien refers to the Elves as &quot;fairies,&quot; the Dwarves are shown as evil, and legendary hero Beren was once written in as an Elf (which changes the story centering on him).<br />But this isn't a book for newbies. Instead it's for people who read and enjoyed &quot;Silmarillion,&quot; not just &quot;Hobbit&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; It also isn't quite as scintillating as &quot;Silmarillion,&quot; however. Why? Because, to put it politely, Christopher Tolkien is a solid scholar, but not a very good writer. His constant analysis of Daddy's work is rather dull and long-winded, though he is to be commended for organizing and publishing them to start with.<br />Tolkien's writing genius, however, shines in every discarded note he wrotes. His prose here is more poetic and flowing. It's a lot less mythic and more &quot;fairy-tale-ish.&quot; And in many of the stories, he provides a lot more detail and insight than in the later drafts.<br />&quot;Book of Lost Tales&quot; is strictly a treat for die-hard Tolkien fans, as anybody who isn't will be hopelessly lost. But oh, what a treat it is.be hopelessly lost. But oh, what a treat it is.	2004-04-29

Lola Schnabel is one such artist. And she exposes her art in &quot;Remember Me,&quot; revealing a scratchy collage of mind-bending photos and paintings. Warning: contents may take a bit of time to digest, but they're worth it.<br />Schnabel's drawings/paintings are vivid and sharp. Sometimes they're just pencil drawings, minimalistand deliberately smudged in places. Others have thin layers of bright paint on them. Her photographs are quite different -- much softer and blurrier, as if seen through a thick window. They seem much more distant and grounded.<br />Schnabel (who had a role in the movie &quot;Basquiat&quot;) doesn't waste time trying to lure in viewers. Her work is just there, and it has no pretenses. Her work has a rough, exhilarating quality, like a an urban crazy quilt. As an added bonus, Rene Picard wrote an essay to accompany &quot;Remember Me.&quot; It serves as a good counterpoint to the artwork, as Picard spins up some poetic prose about Schnabel's art and persona.<br />Schnabel's work is full of light and color. Specifically, her photos have light and her paintings/drawings have color. Splashes of vivid color spread over her drawings and paintings -- sometimes stylized, sometimes just accentuating the rough pencilwork. And her photographs are simply lovely -- horses in the woods, friends and family, graveyards.<br />Beautiful and vivid, budding artist Lola Schnabel's work is like a pile of rough diamonds -- unpolished but still precious. The title is a pretty fortunate one -- &quot;Remember Me&quot; shouldn't be forgotten.	2004-04-28

Sure she can turn a phrase, but she didn't stop turning.<br />Promising actress/telepath Sinah Dellon came to the tiny hick town of Morton's Fork looking for info on her birth mother. Not only does nobody want to admit her mother lived there, but Sinah becomes the local pariah. Elsewhere, rich-boy alcoholic Wycherly Musgrave crashes his car, and takes up temporary residence in Morton's Fork. The residents think he's a magical &quot;conjureman,&quot; but all he wants to do is be left alone with his booze and nightmares.<br />Meanwhile, Truth Jourdemayne, her fiancee and a pair of psychics are coming to Morton's Fork, and Truth is getting a bad feeling about something to come. Sinah and Wycherly meet and explore a sanatorium that burned down in the early 1900s -- which is somehow connected to Sinah's ancestors. The problem is, sinister powers are starting to hijack their thoughts.<br />Bradley took a sloppy mishmash of occultism, mythology (such as her hideous misuse of &quot;sidhe&quot; mythos), and the a few of the flashier New Age trappings, and cooked them together into a half-baked fantasy novel. It's pretty much by-the-numbers -- here's the Mysterious Ancestry! The Hidden Chambers! The Magical Bloodline! The Sinister Cult! The Voices In Their Heads! The Evil Magic! The Good Magic! Even a quickie on an evil altar!<br />In &quot;Gravelight,&quot; it feels like Bradley didn't have the slightest idea how to fill in the middle of the book. The character spend too much time wondering if they're crazy (or in Wycherly's case, thinking about booze). Bradley has a lovely writing style, but it becomes repetitive. For example, Wycherly has a recurring dream about the woman he accidently killed dragging him into the river. The first time, it's powerful. But she keeps reusing the dream so often that it loses its power.<br />And the characters aren't much better than the writing. Either they're good and dull (Sinah and Truth) or they are jerks (Wycherly) with no redeeming features. The Morton's Fork residents are portrayed as inbred rednecks, and Truth's coworkers have no personalities.

Kyle Clayton was one of those incisive 80s authors who wrote hit cynical novels. Since then, life has been one boozy debauched streak. Now he has married an exotic Turkish woman, Ayla, and at her urging has converted to Islam (which seems to be the one part of her life where she follows tradition). Her family (best described as Mid-East hillbillies) is uncomfortable with him, and her dad HATES him. And his marriage to Ayla would be even more endangered if she knew he was planning to get a mistress.<br />Around this same time, Kyle's latest short story comes out: a thinly-veiled retelling of his problems with Ayla's family, and his doubts about Islam. The story is a huge hit, but (a la Salman Rushdie) now militant Muslims are mad at him. Now Kyle is faced with a rapidly deteriorating marriage, a bigoted multimillionaire with some dirty secrets in his closet, and a devout doorman who has declared a fatwa against him (IE, he's going to hunt Kyle down and kill him). That is, if Kyle's father-in-law doesn't kill him first.<br />&quot;Gotham Tragic&quot; is the jaded New Yorker novel with a millennial twist, with plenty of humor and attitude. Not to mention weird plot twists -- there's a waittress whose aunt has supposedly written a book proving the existance of God. But Wenzel keeps a tight grip on his plot, and it never quite runs away from him. Some readers may be a little offput by the upbeat ending, but it doesn't come out of nowhere.<br />Wenzel's humor just avoids being silly at times (a Chinese teenager is called &quot;Wey Tu Yung&quot;). But it's to Wenzel's credit that he manages to do what Kyle set out to do. He tackles philosophical and religious questions and paradoxes -- and not just for Islam either, but also relating to Judaism and Christianity. In America at this time, that's especially hard to do in a novel without treading on some toes, but he manages to do it.<br />Kyle grows up quite a bit over the course of &quot;Gotham Tragic,&quot; usually in painful ways. His wife Ayla could use a bit more fleshing out, like the smart waitress/aspiring actress Erin. Don't be worried about stereotyped Muslims here -- there are Muslim characters of all types and stripes, open-minded or... well, like Ayla's dad.<br />&quot;Gotham Tragic&quot; lightly walks the tightrope between satire and serious novel, only tripping occasionally over itself.

That doesn't seem to be a problem with John Whaley's translation of &quot;Selected Poems,&quot; a lush collection of all kinds of poetry by Goethe.<br />The full range of Goethe's talent is shown here. There are stately poems like &quot;Roman Elegies&quot; (&quot;So diverse are the arrows of Amor; mine are not insolent thoughts...&quot;) and the &quot;Metamorphosis Of Plants.&quot; On the otherhand, Goethe wrote little ditties like &quot;Untitled - From Egmont&quot; (&quot;Glad heart/and sad heart...&quot;) or the four-line &quot;Whatever You Think Truth or Fable.&quot;<br />As a bonus for the bilingual, Whaley includes both the original German and the English translation. His translation seems like a pretty solid one. He preserves the rhyme and rhythm of the original poems, without making them dull. He also includes some basic biographical info that make the poems more relevant. Some of his translations are a little weird (&quot;Are there not nicer rewards touching the sensitive hearts?&quot;), but overall he's done a good job.<br />And what of Goethe? This collection of various poems does an excellent job of showing just what a good poet he was. There are poems of all types: long, short, funny, melancholy, complex and stately, or simple and whimsical. There are special emphasis on nature and love, but also poems devoted to a poet Goethe admired, and also on little observations like a dying fly.<br />The solid translation makes Goethe's &quot;Selected Poems&quot; blossom as they should. A vivid, vibrant collection of deservedly classic poetry, and a must-read.	2004-04-25

Certainly many of the great wits of history didn't. And their words on everything (religion, sex, history, literature) are compiled neatly by subject, for reference by the incurably cynical (or people with GREAT senses of humor).<br />Editor Aubrey Dillon-Malone compiles quotes from everyone from Oscar Wilde to George Bernard Shaw, Ian Fleming to Zsa Zsa Gabor. The country is &quot;a kind of rural grave.&quot; Democracy is &quot;a system in which you say what you like and do what you're told.&quot; A gourmet is &quot;a glutton with brains.&quot; And so on, and so forth, from &quot;ability&quot; to &quot;zoo.&quot;<br />Dillon-Malone does a pretty fair job of collecting other people's cynical quotes and organizing them into the &quot;Cynic's Dictionary.&quot; This thick little book is a bit like Ambrose Bierce's classic &quot;Devil's Dictionary,&quot; only less biting. Plenty of famous wits like George Bernard Shaw (who pops up frequently), Oscar Wilde (ditto), and Shakespeare, and Dillon-Malone knows just where to put them.<br />Some of the quotes, however, aren't as cynical or witty as Dillon-Malone would clearly like them to be. And at times it feels like he is stretching his material thin. He cobbles together quotes from just about everywhere; for example, Calvin Klein's line on makeup (&quot;what it takes to look natural&quot;) is not witty, merely dumb. But he isn't snobby about garnering his nuggets of wit.<br />&quot;The Cynic's Dictionary&quot; is an amusing light read with an acidic edge.

Her writing isn't that good; she spends more time describing designer clothes, furs and shoes than she does describing the characters.

Martin expertly lampoons the religious, social, and cultural conventions of the WASPs of the time, with a father who doesn't know best, a pair of troublemaking kids, and a homemaker mom who talks with the voices in her head.<br /><br />Martin's plays are both cynical and silly (he identifies a luxury item as \\"a thing you have that annoys other people that you have it\\"), with plenty of humor both dark and light.

Alan &quot;Weirdstone of Brisingamen,&quot; a spellbinding story in the true tradition of imaginative and inventive fantasy. Using various bits of Celtic and Norse mythology, Garner wound together an astounding story.<br />Colin and Susan, a pair of English schoolkids, are sent to Alderly for a six-month vacation with their mother's old nurse and her husband. Things start off normally enough, with the kids exploring the area and the myths, legends and superstitions surrounding it. But things begin to take an eerie turn when they encounter a spell-chanting old woman named Selina Place - and then a horde of svart-alfar, hideous and hostile goblins.<br />They are unexpectedly rescued by the wizard Cadellin, who is the keeper of a company of knights sleeping deep under Alderly. They will awaken at some time in the future, to combat the evil spirit Nastrond and his minions in the final, magical battle. There's just one problem: long ago, Cadellin lost the Weirdstone of Brisingamen, the magical jewel that bound the knights there in the first place. Susan realizes too late that the little misty teardrop gem in her bracelet is the Weirdstone - and it's been stolen. The kids team up with Cadellin, the dwarves Fenodyree and Durathror, the lios-alfar (elves), and their friend Gowther to find the Weirdstone - and save the world.<br />Written in the 1960s, this book effectively combines the English-schoolkids-swept-into-magical adventure subgenre with mythology and the overlap of our world with another. Garner's wizards, dwarves, elves and goblins are as legit as Tolkien's, as Garner draws heavily from mythos and legends. There are similarities to Tolkien's creations, but they are sufficiently different that not once do you feel the need to compare. Garner lifts from Norse and Celtic mythologies for this book (mentions of the Morrigan and Ragnarok are featured within pages of one another) and manages to cobble it together into a coherent and believable whole.<br />Alderly is effectively shown - from the moment the kids venture out of the farm, there is the sense that enchantment is thrumming through the land, and that a magical creature could be lurking nearby. The sense of atmosphere is somewhat stunted by the fact that we rarely hear the characters' thoughts, though, but such creatures as the svart-alfar and the lios-alfar are effective in the simple, evocative descriptions.<br />This is a book more for Tolkien fans than Diana Wynne-Jones fans. Though there are a few funny parts, it is overall a relentlessly serious book, with many of the characters using archaic-sounding language. Another good thing: the kids speak like twentieth-century preteens (&quot;That WOULD have made a mess of things!&quot;) while such characters as Durathror speaking like warriors from centuries ago (&quot;... for there I think it will be, and so to Fundindelve, where I shall join you if I may.&quot;) In addition, there is no cutesy magic or gimmickry, or casual magical elements popping up every page or two. The magic featured in here is deadly serious and very intense.<br />Colin and Susan are the archetypical kids-on-holiday-in-magical-place: brave, respectful, inquisitive, curious, and in completely over their heads. Cadellin is an excellent wizard, dignified and powerful but sufficiently human to be sympathetic, such as his reaction when he hears that the Weirdstone has been stolen from Susan. This guy deserves a seat right below Gandalf, and alongside Merlin, Ged and Ebenezum. The dwarves are serious and unusually cool-headed for the fantasy portrayal of dwarves; the lios-alfar are featured less prominently, but the &quot;elves of light&quot; passage is one of the most moving paragraphs in the book, both sad and beautiful.<br />The only problem with this book is its shortness, and its presence as only one of two.

Now in &quot;Zingerman's Guide To Good Eating,&quot; Ari Weinzweig offers a glimpse into the best foods available.<br />&quot;Guide&quot; is half cookbook, half gourmet bible. Weinzweig offers some good recipes (like gazpacho with sherry vinegar, or grilled Tuscan pecorino cheese), but the core of this book is what goes into those. And it's enough to drive a devoted foodie insane -- olive oils, vinegars and oils; pasta and grains; meats; cheeses, and seasonings.<br />And Weinzweig doesn't skimp on the details either. Within every chapter, he describes the different kinds of... whatever he's talking about. For cheeses, he provides a buying guide, then the different kinds: Parmigiano-Reggiano, cheddar, mountain, blue, et cetera. For deli meat, it's salami, Serrano ham, prosciutto, and smoked salmon. As a bonus, he describes the history and making-of each product.<br />Warning: Do not read this book on an empty stomach. The descriptions of food will make you drool -- especially the people who have tasted Zingermans' food before. Even the less savory ideas (salmon anemia) can't kill the response this book will provoke. (And a certain feeling of confidence is inspired by the radio hosts and cookbook authors quoted on the back, as well as restauranteur Mario Batali of &quot;Babbo&quot;)<br />A lot of food books can be condescending to the non-gourmet. But Weinzweig avoids that. His style is almost conversational, like having a chat with a gourmet chef. He talks about his own experiences, his own likes, and descriptions of his chats with people who know best. (Including a conversation that compares selecting prosciutto-pigs to dating)<br />So for those who can't experience Zingerman's itself, the &quot;Zingerman's Guide To Good Eating&quot; is a must-have --  both for recipes and info about fine food in general. Just don't read through on an empty stomach.and info about fine food in general. Just don't read through on an empty stomach.	2004-04-21

Don't think Viggo Mortensen is just an actor, as talented as he is in that. &quot;Recent Forgeries&quot; is a collage of his works of all kinds, with poetry woven together with pictures and paintings... not to mention the CD. Pieced together but never patchy, this is a must-have.<br />Mortensen offers a display of poetry, often melancholy and thoughtful (&quot;I taste the blood/that shimmered/on your lips/Lingering, like guilt does&quot;). There's also a selection of what seem like short stories woven in, like the slice-of-life &quot;Relay&quot; or the charming &quot;Bedtime Story For Henry.&quot; And of course, paintings and photographs: the vivid &quot;Sun Losing Its Yellow,&quot; soothingly surreal &quot;Mute,&quot; and the quiet still photographs like &quot;School.&quot; (A mildly decayed stone gate)<br />Accompanying the &quot;Recent Forgeries&quot; book is a CD, in which Mortensen reads his poetry out loud, including &quot;Bedtime Story For Henry,&quot; &quot;Clear,&quot; and a handful that are not included in the book itself. Mortensen's smooth voice is accompanied by Buckethead, DJ Bonebrake and others.<br />Most people who act don't have a lot of artistic dimension beyond that. Chalk one up for the eclectic bohemian: Mortensen has mastered self-expression in different ways, and shows it well in &quot;Recent Forgeries.&quot; There's a little of everything -- everything, that is, that can be pressed between book covers. Along the way, the photos, paint and words seem to run together into a sweeping, colorful landscape.<br />Mortensen's assorted artwork can evoke anything -- his poetry ranges from funny (like the quirky &quot;Home&quot;) to poignant to ironic, and his artwork can be soft or angular, usually filled with great waves of color. At first some of them look random, but closer inspection shows just how careful and deliberate they are. His photographs are about the only thing that stay the same -- Mortensen focuses on little things that most people would miss, like signs, trees, empty stone gates with overgrown roads, and so on.<br />A rich, well-rounded look into the mind of a talented artist. Viggo Mortensen's &quot;Recent Forgeries&quot; is a treat for anyone who appreciates art in all its forms.

It's all been done before, and less annoyingly.<br />It charts Mick Jagger's early life as a rambunctious, relatively ordinary little kid, to a teen music enthusiast and then to a budding pop star. His bizarre sex appeal made him a universal sensation, and his work with fellow Rolling Stone Keith Richards made him a musical one. Not to mention (of course) a string of high-profile girlfriends and wives that included models, socialites and singers.<br />Seay writes about Jagger with the sort of gooey compliments lavished on media favorites. Here, Jagger can do no wrong, or at least not much of it. His tumultuous love life (involving both sexes, Seay constantly reminds us) dominates this book. He slept with this person! He had a fling with that person! It pretty much makes up the entire book, as Seay spends little time focusing on the creative side of the Stones.<br />Despite claiming to be &quot;the story behind the Rolling Stone,&quot; there really is nothing new about Jagger in this book. Seay just lists the same fights, concerts, and interview snippets, while adding nothing to them. Jagger remains enigmatic throughout the book, and Seay only stops now and then to offer some guesses on what the rock star was thinking.<br />Seay also has an annoying habit of playing favorites with the assorted people who surrounded Jagger, especially women. For example, Marianne Faithfull is venerated as a saintly junkie/convent girl, whereas Anita Pallenberg is vilified as a &quot;depraved den mother&quot; who would try to get advantages with &quot;her body and her wicked imagination.&quot; Bianca's gambling and sexy clothes make her an even bigger target. On the other hand, the raging excesses of the Stones are often glossed over.<br />Sleazy excess and Jagger's overactive love life are the focuses of &quot;Mick Jagger: The Story Behind the Rolling Stone.&quot; There's nothing new here, and little worth checking out.er.<br />Sleazy excess and Jagger's overactive love life are the focuses of &quot;Mick Jagger: The Story Behind the Rolling Stone.&quot; There's nothing new here, and little worth checking out.	2004-04-20

It's a straightforward, solid sci-fi adventure, though it lacks in character development and spends too much time on action chases.<br />Fourteen-year-old Jack Morgan is a thief, a fugitive, and an orphan accused of a crime he didn't commit; the guy raising him is a holographic replica of his Uncle Virge. When Jack is hiding on an abandoned planet, he sees ships engage in a battle, and one crashes. When he and Virge check out the wreckage, a dragon-like creature leaps at Jack -- and becomes a two-dimensional, tattoolike image on his skin.<br />It turns out the dragon is Draycos, a K'Da warrior whose symbiotic host died in the attack. The K'Da are incredibly smart and dangerous, but they die in six hours if their host dies. Jack soon learns that there are advantages to having the stalwart Draycos on his side -- especially when they are being attacked by the Valahgua, the deadly race who have lethal energy weapon &quot;The Death.&quot; Together Jack and Draycos must clear Jack's name and stop the Valahgua.<br />&quot;Dragon and Thief&quot; takes place in a pretty standard sci-fi setting, with space travel, cool gadgets and a few trappings reminiscent of cheesy SF movies. Aliens, battles, and a teenaged anti-hero are the basis of it all. Zahn doesn't add a lot to the setting, but he gives a good feeling for the grit and danger of it.<br />Written with a young adult audience in mind, &quot;Dragon and Thief&quot; could use a few more pages. Zahn keeps the plot going by fast, but fails to pause for much development -- he barely even describes the future world that he drops readers into, and the characters don't get a lot of development. But he's clearly thought out the sci-fi elements, such as the Valahgua and the K'Da. The idea of a giant dragon that turns into a tattoo could have been silly, but Zahn pulls it off well.<br />Draycos (the dragon of the title) is by far the most interesting character in the book. He's a &quot;poet-warrior,&quot; with a strict code of ethics and wicked fighting skills of all stripes. Jack (the thief) is substantially less interesting as an anti-hero, and he never develops much of a personality. Uncle Virge is much more interesting (which is surprising as he is actually dead).<br />&quot;Dragon and Thief&quot; is a flawed but promising start to a new sci-fi series.

While the opening book, &quot;Truckers&quot; lags in places and takes quite some time to really get moving, it's imaginative and very funny. Certainly it's a good place to start off with Pratchett's fiction.<br />Masklin and the other nomes are tiny people who scavenge on the streets, and now there are only a handful of them left. In an act of desperation, they climb into a lorry and ride to... The Store. Also known as Arnold Bros (est. 1905), where a complex civilization of nomes (about two thousand) live in semi-peace and prosperity. They either are dazzled by the idea of &quot;Outside,&quot; or insist that the whole world is in Arnold Bros (est. 1905).<br />Seemingly, everything is fine for Masklin and his friends, especially when the mysterious Thing (a black box that is a spaceship's flight computer) comes to life and tells them more about their history. But suddenly their world is disrupted by the news of &quot;All Things Must Go -- Final Sales.&quot; Now the nomes must escape the Store and find yet another place to live.<br />Tiny people living in a department store? Who are from another planet? That is something that could have bombed easily and hideously. But it doesn't, at least not in &quot;Truckers.&quot; Clever plot elements like the sign-based religion (they take &quot;everything under one roof&quot; seriously!) and the department-based clans (Stationari, Corsetri) keep this unlikely plot afloat.<br />While &quot;Truckers&quot; is a self-contained story in itself, it has plenty of loose threads (mostly involving the Thing and the origins of the nomes) at the end, for the second and third books of the trilogy. The writing has Pratchett's usual sparseness and wit; the only problem is that it takes forever for the nomes to do anything. At least it's a fun slow ride. The wacky truck drive near the end is one of the best parts of the book.<br />Masklin and his nome band (especially the indefatigable, vaguely frightening Granny) serve as a good window into the nome civilization, since they're learning about it too. The better-off nomes are a bit snottier but eager to explore the Outside. But the Thing steals the show; despite being just a computer, it has a better idea than the nomes what is going on.<br />&quot;Truckers&quot; will delight fans of Pratchett, but you don't need to be a fan already to enjoy this story. While the plot takes awhile to go anywhere, the quirky characters and wonderful worldbuilding make it worthwhile.ially the indefatigable, vaguely frightening Granny) serve as a good window into the nome civilization, since they're learning about it too.

A hard-edged whodunnit, Hammett's writing had become very polished and his characters even more intricate by the time he wrote this, and while it's not the best he had written, it's a solid example of his work.<br />Nick Charles was a rough'n'tough detective... until he married wealthy socialite Nora. Now he's retired early, drinks a lot, and has no apparent wish to come into contact with his messy past life. Enter Dorothy Wynant, daughter of weird (and possibly insane) inventor Clyde Wynant. As it happens, Wynant's secretary/mistress has just been murdered, and was found dying by his ex-wife Mimi.<br />Nick keeps insisting that he doesn't want to detect, but somehow he gets sucked into it anyway when a gangster (ex-boyfriend of the murdered woman) invades his home and nearly kills him. Dorothy keeps popping up and pleading for help and protection; Charles' old flame Mimi is acting oddly; and her husband has some secrets of his own. Despite Nick's aversion to detective work, he and Nora set out to unravel the mystery surrounding the Thin Man. (Wynant, for your information)<br />Hammett's cynical attitude was a huge part of his writing, but there's a new dimension to it in &quot;Thin Man.&quot; Charles spends a lot of time trying to distance himself from his detective past, and in a way it feels like Hammett was distancing himself from his detective novels. Was Nick's dissatisfaction a sign of Hammett's? Quite possibly.<br />But many of the things about &quot;Thin Man&quot; are vintage Hammett: lying waifs, men in disguise, lots of lying and booze. Almost everyone is sociopathic, and Nick and Nora aren't exactly what one would call &quot;heroes.&quot; However, the dialogue is sharp and witty and the action is slickly exciting. Best of all, Hammett's writing had evolved a bit from his minimalist style; here he describes things like Mimi snarling in a bit more detail.<br />Nick is the quintessential Hammett anti-hero (cynical, tough, and more than a little obnoxious), except here he's a bit weathered and tired out. Sam Spade and the Continental Op were on top of their games, but he's past his. Nora comes across as a little perkier but as tough in her own way. The crazy Wynant family, like manipulative mom Mimi and freaky son Gilbert, serves as a nice source of conflict.<br />&quot;The Thin Man&quot; wasn't the best thing Hammett ever wrote, but it's still a solid mystery read.

And unlike many a story of elves or faeries since, Tolkien keeps that sense of mystery and magic in the world of the supernatural.<br /><br />It takes place in a little town \\"not very long ago for those with long memories, not very far away fro those with long legs.\\" The Master Cook of that village takes a vacation, and returns with an apprentice in tow. But something odd happens at the Feast of the Cake -- the cook stirs in a \\"fay-star\\" with little trinkets in the cake, and it's accidentally swallowed by a boy there.<br /><br />The boy (later called Smith) is changed by the fay-star, which sparkles on his forehead. When he grows up, Smith ventures into Faery itself, and even meets the Faery Queen herself. The message she gives him is for her mysterious, missing husband, the King -- who turns out to be the last person anybody in Wootton Major would have expected.<br /><br />\\"Smith\\" is a fairy tale in the best sense. Don't expect cackling witches or convenient loopholes in spells here; Tolkien was too skilled for that. Instead we have majestic fey and sparkling magic, woven with a tidy medieval town (consider the custom of naming people after their jobs -- Smith, a smith, capisce?). Never once does it become precious or cutesy, only more enchanted as it goes along.<br /><br />It's also among Tolkien's simpler writings, especially since it is effectively a short story. In fact, it's so simple that it barely has a plot -- the vanishing King is the closest it has to conflict or a complete plot.<br /><br />But Tolkien's writing sparkles with little details of the fey, with only a minimum of description. His glimpses of Faerieland are too brief, but written with the exquisite, haunting quality of his better-known works (\\"Once in these wanderings he was overtaken by a grey mist and strayed long at a loss, until the mist rolled away and he found that he was in a wide plain\\"). And he gives the impression of a world of magic far greater than any human could grasp (\\"... bearing the white ships that return from battles on the Dark Marches of which men know nothing\\").<br /><br />And Smith is an odd sort of hero, infused with a kind of otherworldly light and grace that shines from him in the form of \\"Starbrow.\\" Perhaps it was so stand in for the ability to see the magical and fantastical in the mundane world -- and if so, perhaps Tolkien felt that he himself had been given a fay-star that never left him.<br /><br />Certainly the beauty and sweetness of \\"Smith of Wootton Major\\" suggest that he had one always -- an underrated little tale of magic and faerie, which highlights Tolkien's sublime writing.brief, but written with the exquisite, haunting quality of his better-known works (\\"Once in these wanderings he was overtaken by a grey mist and strayed long at a loss, until the mist rolled away and he found that he was in a wide plain\\").

And sometimes, it does figure-eights. Marian Keyes' &quot;The Other Side of the Story&quot; is an intriguing, very complex interweaving of three women's lives, and the little karmic ripples in their various lives. It can get a little bewildering at times, but Keyes' book is clever, funny, and quite touching.<br />Party planner Gemma's father has left her mother for the hard, bossy Colette. Now Gemma is emotionally supporting her broken mother, trying to plan a spoiled rich girl's medieval birthday party, and writing frenzied emails to her best friend. She's angry at her dad, and fantasizing about her mother finding love with a hunky younger man. Pal Susan sends the emails to a literary agent, Jojo... who, in an ironic twist, is the Other Woman in an affair with a married man.<br />Even more ironically, Jojo is also agent to Lily, author of surprise bestseller &quot;Mimi's Remedies&quot; (a cute, gooey little fairy tale that people love). And Lily is living with Gemma's ex-boyfriend Anton, whom she stole from Gemma. Now she feels guilty about it. When she learns that Gemma is writing a book to be agented by Jojo, she becomes convinced that somehow karma will rear its head and bite her. Three lives are thrown into turmoil, and three women make sudden changes for better or worse.<br />&quot;The Other Side of the Story&quot; isn't just good chick lit, it's a good book overall. Keyes takes a few wry pokes at the publishing industry -- no punches pulled, she doesn't pretend that even surprise hits are set for life. There's a bit of a lesson here -- there's another &quot;side of the story&quot; for every person, be it the Boyfriend-Stealer, the Other Woman, or the Frustrated Daughter. And their side is just as valid.<br />It's a little disconcerting when Keyes switches lead characters several chapters in. First we're listening to the slightly off-kilter thoughts of Gemma, then we're hearing about Jojo. And once Jojo is firmly set in the book, it's off to Lily-land. But once you adjust to the sudden changes of perspective, the book settles into a smooth rhythm.<br />Keyes manages to juggle a lot of plot threads -- younger boyfriends, failing books, cheating husbands -- without leaving any dangling. And she strikes a good balance between humor and drama. On one hand, we have Lily's purchase of a house she can't afford, and the subsequent financial (and emotional) problems. On the other, we have Gemma's hilariously over-the-top visions of her mom  going out in the world and dating a hunk.<br />Gemma is perhaps the most endearing character; she's a little weird, but in a likable way. Lily is struggling with guilt and worry, and Jojo is a smart, ambitious businesswoman. Keyes shows her skill in making each different woman believable and likable in her own way.

While the worldbuilding and background for the first book of his new series is outstanding, his writing doesn't live up to his imagination. It's a flawed but deeply interesting book overall.<br />The Briar King is a remnant of the old pagan beliefs, living on only in little superstitions and children's songs. But after the old holter Aspar rescues a nerdy young priest, they learn of strange things that are stirring in the woods, and human beings are dropping dead or being sacrificed -- and Aspar encounters a greffyn, a mythical monster whose touch and breath can kill. They're all signs that the Briar King is waking.<br />But the Briar King isn't the only source of trouble: the royal Dare family is being quietly turned on its head. Someone is trying to kill the queen, Princess Lesbeth has vanished mysteriously, and idealistic young knight Neil has fallen in love with Princess Fastia (who is married). Worst of all, one of the royals has gone mad, and threatens to destroy his entire family. The only one who may escape is immature Anne, who has been having strange visions.<br />It's virtually impossible to write semi-original fantasies now, but Keyes dodges the typical cliches -- elves, wizards, Dark Lords and demons. The story is engaging and unusual, but it starts stumbling partway through. But it demonstrates that Keyes has a good story worth telling; it ends on a &quot;to be continued&quot; note, of course.<br />Keyes starts off strong with mysterious occurrances and plenty of creepiness. He puts a lot of effort and description into his worldbuilding, such as the Dare family, the pseudo-Christian religion and well-crafted myths. But about halfway through &quot;Briar King,&quot; Keyes starts to lose control of the story. There are too many subplots that only seem to be marginally tied together (what is up with that love potion subplot?), and it loses the creepy quality.<br />Keyes' writing is pedestrian most of the time, although it blossoms whenever something really freaky is happening. The description of Aspar encountering the Briar King is brief, but strikingly ominous. And once you get past the typical lead characters (spirited princess, priest with a lot to learn, cocky swordsman), there are plenty of unique supporting roles (like the dead old woman in the caves).<br />&quot;The Briar King&quot; is an unsteady but promising start to Greg Keyes new series.

While his biography of actress Marlene Dietrich is well-written, he seems too disconnected from his subject.<br />Marlene Dietrich was a dominant sex symbol alongside the distant Greta Garbo. Her big break came with Josef von Sternberg, a German director who found the struggling actress and made her his muse, lover and inspiration. Dietrich kept spreading her wings in Hollywood, and in the 1940s she entertained Allied troops for her adopted country.<br />Spoto does a pretty good job of covering Dietrich's many-faceted life. Hausfrau and actress, Berlin cabaret and Hollywood, he checks it all out and describes it with a fair amount of detail. And despite the varied nature of Dietrich's love life, he at least tries to keep his tone professional and detached. (Even when describing Dietrich placing a bouquet of violets in a rather, um, intimate place)<br />What's Spoto's biggest problem? He seems to have no idea what made Dietrich tick. When describing the real Dietrich -- the woman behind the image -- he seems genuinely befuddled by her real personality, and spends too much time speculating on her motivations. However, he sheds a great deal of light on Dietrich's mystique, and how it was created by von Sternberg.<br />Donald Spoto's &quot;Blue Angel&quot; sheds some light on the not-so-angelic Marlene Dietrich, but his lack of insight into Dietrich's mind makes it a somewhat frustrating read.	2004-04-16

Byatt is the master of fiction that focuses on art and literature, like the &quot;Matisse Stories&quot; or &quot;Possession.&quot; But in &quot;Biographer's Tale&quot; she misfires by hammering square pegs into round holes, despite a solidly engaging idea and some likable characters.<br />Student Phineas Nanson decides to ditch his present studies to become a biographer -- specifically, to &quot;biograph&quot; a famous biographer, Scholes Destry-Scholes. Destry-Scholes was writing a long biography of Elmer Bole when he was apparently killed in a whirlpool. He carefully studies Destry-Scholes' elusive notes and writings about three unnamed men who turn out to be Carl Linnaeus, scientist Sir Francis Galton, and dramatist Henrik Ibsen.<br />Phineas continues hunting down clues and twisty truths about Destry-Scholes, running into two compelling women along the way. But the facts are seldom as concrete as they seem, something Phineas finds out. He soon begins to unearth new information about his subject, that changes the way he sees Destry-Scholes.<br />Cross avant-garde classic &quot;Pale Fire&quot; with the mind-bending &quot;House of Leaves&quot; and you will get something like &quot;Biographer's Tale.&quot; Like Nabokov's quirky study of critical analysis, this is a highly literate study with plenty to fuel it. Byatt's writing is pleasantly lush and detailed. Her grip on Victorian artistes, not to mention the layers of writing, is rarely paralleled.<br />But there's a certain out-of-control quality to &quot;Biographer's Tale.&quot; Several times, Byatt interrupts the narrative to have Nanson ramble at length about his childhood, primates, magic, and any number of any other topics. The problem is, it isn't very interesting. Nanson's thoughts tend to be kind of random, and his actions are bloodlessly briefly-described. Add to that that she flings in some elements like interviews, letters, poetry, and a stumbling conclusion, and the result is a tangle.<br />Self-important graduate student Nanson is the biggest weakness of the book. Since it's all in first-person, he rambles incessently; he has the distant, coy quality of a trickster you only encounter over the Web. Byatt tries to make him quirky, but he merely seems insubstantial. Other characters, such as Destry-Scholes' niece or the gay guys, have more substance, but they are still seen through Nanson's eyes.<br />Predictable and plodding, there's a novel in the spirit of &quot;Pale Fire&quot; locked somewhere in &quot;Biographer's Tale&quot;'s cold, distant shell. But Byatt forgot to unlock the door before sending this puppy off.portant graduate student Nanson is the biggest weakness of the book.

Lewis: The Gift of Friendship	Books	4	21	22	N	N	Pen pals	Just about everyone who knows things about the life of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; author J.R.R. Tolkien knows that he was pals with fellow fantasy writer C.S. Lewis (author of the &quot;Narnia&quot; series). But where that's usually a sidenote in Tolkien biographies, Colin Duriez makes it the center of double-biography &quot;Tolkien and C.S. Lewis: The Gift of Friendship.&quot;<br />Duriez focuses on Lewis and Tolkien's early lives, the differences in their religious progressions, their wartime experiences, their fantasy works and their involvement in Christian literary club The Inklings. In 1926, the quiet Tolkien (&quot;Tollers&quot;) and ebullient Lewis met and became friends over a shared love of Christianity, language myth and imagination.<br />Duriez's main idea in &quot;Gift of Friendship&quot; is that this friendship created some of the most influential fantasy and science fiction ever, by mutual support. Religious beliefs and &quot;the horns of elfland&quot; were important for them both. For example, it was partly through Lewis's encouragement that Tolkien managed to finish his stories of Middle-Earth, and Tolkien in turn helped with Lewis's more serious works.<br />Duriez doesn't reveal anything new about the friendship or the men in it, and he focuses quite a bit on the Inklings at large at one point. (Since he wrote a book on them, it isn't surprising) However, he clearly is a big fan of both men and his enthusiasm is obvious. He briskly clears away some misconceptions (for example, Tolkien did not hate the Narnia books, he merely &quot;disliked&quot; them) and throws in some literary analysis of Middle-Earth, the Ransom books and Narnia that doesn't stray too far from the authors' intents.<br />&quot;Tolkien and C.S. Lewis: The Gift of Friendship&quot; doesn't offer more than a few tidbits that are new, but it's a good focus on Tolkien and Lewis's friendship and how it affected their epic books.	2004-04-08

Things get more complicated when old mysteries are solved. &quot;The Hunting of the Hind&quot; tells of a deer-woman so beautiful that she drives men mad, and the princess who is trying to free her. And McKinley presents two old fairy tales given a new spin: &quot;The Princess and the Frog,&quot; a story of brotherly treachery, and &quot;Twelve Dancing Princesses,&quot; given a darker tinge.<br />Robin McKinley's writing is better suited to novels than short stories. In &quot;The Door in the Hedge,&quot; she does a pretty good job. Not a great job, not even a good job -- just a pretty good one. When it comes to style, her writing is nearly impeccable, but it's in the actual stories told that she stumbles over her own quill pen.<br />&quot;Stolen Princess&quot; takes forever to move past McKinley's lectures about customs and problems in the kingdom, but moves steadily and well once it gets to Princess Lindanel's kidnapping. This one could easily have been expanded into a full-length book. &quot;Hunting of the Hind&quot; is even better, tight and strong. But the two fairy-tale retellings are stilted and too short.<br />McKinley's writing is detailed and has some moments that are pure poetry, such as Lindanel's first meeting with the prince of Faerieland, or Princess Korah finding the Hind. The biggest difficulty is the characterizations -- the three last stories are too short for her to develop the characters enough for readers to really like 'em.<br />Flawed but pretty, &quot;The Door in the Hedge&quot; is a nice read for fans of retold fairy tales. Just don't expect anything like McKinley's usual level of storytelling.characters enough for readers to really like 'em.<br />Flawed but pretty, &quot;The Door in the Hedge&quot; is a nice read for fans of retold fairy tales.

Viggo Mortensen wears plenty of different hats as an artist. \\"Coincidence of Memory\\" collects assorted poetry, paintings and photographs ranging from the late 1970s to 2002. Whenever they are from and whatever they are, his creations are vivid and very striking.<br />In both his visual and literary art, Mortensen shows a sort of evocative simplicity. His poetry can bring to mind very powerful emotions that are left up to us to imagine (\\"Tried to say something/that filled my mouth/and longed to rest/in your ear/Don't dare write/it down for fear it'll/become words, just/words...\\"). He can also bring to mind simpler, more everyday things like arguments, frozen roads and observing the changes in nature.<br />His photography has the delicacy of a painting, with skilful use of light and color -- and the paintings are even better. For example, one is a simple shot of a mossy tree trunk surrounded by dry grass; another is of a leafless tree reflected in a car hood, and yet another is a darkly-lit picture of some little plants on the ground. Most striking is a photograph of electrical cables \\"intruding\\" on a grassy spot.<br />There's an intimate, capture-the-moment feel to Mortensen's photographs, as if you can see these things through his eyes for a moment. The paintings are just as good, such as \\"Self-Portrait, April\\". It's a picture of Mortensen's lips and chin, with all other featured obscured by a collage-like swirl of hazy artwork. The paintings are definitely absorbing, even if you don't understand the story behind them.<br />Viggo Mortensen's evocative, thoughtful artwork is shown in three different forms -- poetry, photographs and paintings -- in the beautiful \\"Coincidence of Memory.\\" A haunting, remarkable collection of Mortensen's work.	2004-04-05

And this is the charming setting of Jane Yolen's Pit Dragon Trilogy. The first book, &quot;Dragon's Blood,&quot; is a bit uneven but a solid story about freedom, courage, and friendship.<br />Austar IV was originally settled by criminals, and the place still isn't very inviting. Most of the people are &quot;bonders&quot; (slaves) or prostitutes, and the main source of money is betting on the &quot;pit dragons,&quot; who fight for gamblers. And orphaned bonder Jakkin dreams of freedom, and has a secret plan to fill his bag with gold and free himself -- steal a new dragon hatchling and quietly raise it to fight in the pits.<br />At first, a disaster involving a panicking dragon seems to dash his dreams. Then Jakkin finds an uncounted hatchling and spirits it away to the hills. But he soon learns that someone knows his secret -- the pretty Akki, an independent girl who is hiding an odd secret of her own. But even her help may not be enough to free Jakkin from slavery.<br />In &quot;Dragon's Blood,&quot; Yolen shakes off the dust of the old Anne McCaffrey stereotypes about dragons and the humans who raise 'em. Though there are a handful of similarities, Yolen's dragons are raised to fight and are actually sort of alien lizards. And there's nothing refined about the world she creates here -- it's gritty, dusty, raw and very dangerous.<br />&quot;Dragon's Blood&quot; doesn't have much of a storyline except raising the hatchling and getting to know Akki, and at times it drags. But Yolen keeps it interesting with plenty of details and interesting characters. Her dragons are particularly good -- they're intelligent but still animals, with individual personalities and strengths. Hey, she even uses them as a curse source. (&quot;Fewmets!&quot;)<br />Jakkin is a nice, solid hero, your basic good kid who does something mildly wrong in an effort to free himself. He's not so much a hero as he is a human being who tries to help others, be they dragons or other people. His fellow bonders -- including a vindictive old junkie and the mysterious Akki -- are also nicely done, although relatively little time is spent on the other bonders.<br />&quot;Dragon's Blood&quot; is a solid start to a solid sci-fantasy trilogy. Yolen takes the old cliches about dragons and whips them back into shape.

At first she was just a poet, although an outstandingly vivid one, and then she became a punk rocker with a unique look and style all her own. Upon her marriage to MC5 rocker Fresh Smith, Patti Smith vanished from the limelight for many years to be a quiet, obedient housewife... only to reappear when her husband died.<br />At first, Bockris starts off strong with descriptions of Smith's childhood rebellions and love of rock'n'roll (including as her blunt description of her first glimpse of the Rolling Stones). Then she first arrives in New York and becomes enmeshed in the gritty avant-garde gaggle of artists and musicians -- so far so good. But the story starts to unravel when music comes back into the picture.<br />When Smith's music comes onto the scene, Bockris distances himself. He sticks to her eccentricities and naster moments, with little emphasis on her music (such as her rivalry with Debbie Harry, which is never explained in full). The descriptions of Patti's husband, lovers and friends aren't very well-rounded -- we basically get a 2-D picture and that's it.<br />&quot;Patti Smith: An Unauthorized Biography&quot; is mainly patched together from interviews and articles. That's always a problem; it puts a distance between the biographer and subject. And some of Bockris' comments about Smith's marriage seem suspect, almost like he was determined to see it as a failure. He seems disappointed that she opted to be a housewife for awhile rather than a punk goddess.<br />Unbalanced and patched together from previous material, &quot;Patti Smith: An Unauthorized Biography&quot; is a passable starting point, but by no means a good source for info on Smith's life and art.l, &quot;Patti Smith: An Unauthorized Biography&quot; is a passable starting point, but by no means a good source for info on Smith's life and art.	2004-04-05

Don't look here for hot gossip or lesbian secrets, however, because &quot;Here Lies the Heart&quot; is not that kind of autobiography. Rather, De Acosta charts out the fascinating life and people she was fortunate enough to meet, with energy and wit to spare.<br />Starting early in her life, Mercedes De Acosta had a love of the arts -- just about anything, so long as the person who made it was a passionate artist. As a little girl, she met presidents and royalty. She was part of an eccentric Spanish family living in the US, who dared to skim by controversy (backless dresses, divorce).<br />Mercedes herself was an unusual person, who pursued Eastern religion, fought for animal and women's rights, wore pants before it was acceptable, and threatened to divorce her new husband when he referred to her by a married name. She worked (rather disappointingly) in Hollywood and travelled all over the world. And throughout her life De Acosta met and/or befriended poets, playwrights, singers, actors -- including Isadora Duncan, George Bernard Shaw, Noel Coward, Greta Garbo, Sarah Bernhardt, Marlene Dietrich, and many others.<br />Mercedes De Acosta wrote one of the rarest kinds of autobiographies: She talked a lot more about other people than she did about herself. In fact, we get to know her a lot better by how she saw other people than how she described herself -- impulsive, romantic, and tending to self-examination. Her memories become a bit fantastical in places, like where she claims to remember hugging a bear when she was a baby. But it feels like kicking a puppy to complain about accuracy problems.<br />Though De Acosta had affairs with some of the people in &quot;Here Lies the Heart,&quot; you wouldn't really know it just by reading. She seems to focus just on friendship, and the impressive or enlightened qualities that the people she knew had -- at times, she even seems to have crushes on them all. Part of a poet's passionate nature? Maybe. Her writing certainly has a touch of poetry in it, very detailed and full of strong images like black ships, coats thrown over beds and scarves blowing in the wind.<br />Mercedes De Acosta's &quot;Here Lies The Heart&quot; is an endearing memoir of a unique life.

While occasionally the &quot;top fives&quot; can grate a little, this is a charmingly original, wry and thoughtful novel - an offbeat romance for our times.<br />Rob owns a little music shop in London, which is a good thing because he is musically obsessed -- pop music, he claims, makes him fall in love. But even pop music can't heal his heart when his longtime girlfriend Laura breaks up and moves out. What's worse, Rob has no idea WHY she broke up with him, and he feels mixed feelings about losing her (he cares about her) and her musical tastes (bad).<br />He immerses himself in his rickety business with his weirdo employees (these guys alone are worth checking out the book for). He dates a folk singer. He learns that Laura is now involved with the repulsive guy upstairs. And finally, he assesses his past sex life and romances (the top five, specifically), getting a bit of insight into what Laura's problem with him might be: He's stuck in his mid-teens.<br />Thirty-five is kind of old to grow up. But like many real people, Rob learns that it's change or die (in his case, alone and surrounded by records). &quot;High Fidelity&quot; is a nice blend of musical/movie memoir, love story and belated-coming-of-age tale. It's kind of geeky and pokes fun at itself, but therein lies its charm.<br />Hornby writes a nice, breezy kind of prose, peppered with plenty of pop culture and musical references. Not to mention the top five lists: Top Five Episodes of Cheers. Best Side One Track Ones Of All Time. Top Five Bands or Musicians Who Will Have To Be Shot Come the Musical Revolution. At times the pop culture name-dropping gets a bit tiresome, but it mostly underlines how quirky and mildly obsessive Rob can be.<br />And oh, he can be quirky. He can also be a self-centered jerk, and a bit confused and clueless to boot. Hornby's alter ego is likable for his flaws, and somehow manages to shed a little light on how men think. Good backup comes in his clerks Barry and Dick, who are just as geekily eccentric about music and lists as Rob is.<br />Music buffs and Brit-lit fans will devour &quot;High Fidelity.&quot; Charmingly insightful and brimming over with self-conscious eccentricity.

Tolkien's tales of Middle-Earth weren't restricted just to fantasy epic &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; His life's work was spread over hundreds of stories and invented legends -- some were compiled into &quot;The Silmarillion.&quot; But some were left over, little odd bits that make up &quot;Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-Earth.&quot;<br />Tolkien presents stories spanning Middle-Earth's history, with dragons and mythical heroes like Turin, background information on Elf queen Galadriel and her husband Celeborn, and different accounts of searches for the One Ring, including more exposition about the wizard-turned-bad Saruman and the other Istari. There are also essays about palantiri, wizards, and the family line of Elrond's mortal brother Elros. Best among these is a &quot;lost chapter&quot; where Gandalf talks to Frodo about the Dwarves.<br />This isn't a novel, or even a sort of pseudo-history like &quot;Silmarillion.&quot; It's more like a patchwork quilt of little odd bits that don't belong anywhere else. Anybody who hasn't read &quot;Silmarillion,&quot; &quot;Hobbit&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; will be hopelessly lost. But those who have read and understood those books will eat these right up -- there's plenty of info about favorite characters like Gandalf, Galadriel, and the heroes and villains from Tolkien's sprawling epics.<br />Tolkien's vivid writing is shown in its different states here -- there's the stately semi-mythic writing, and the more intimate conversational style of &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; He even dabbles briefly in first-person storytelling through the eyes of Frodo Baggins. Lots of details and ethereally evocative descriptions make it all come alive.<br />&quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; is a fill-in-the-gaps sort of book, and Tolkien's storytelling genius still shines through in this disjointed collection of essays, bits and pieces.

But what about guys? Kyle Smith presents the flip side of chick-lit, a light relationship-based book for guys called &quot;Love Monkey.&quot; It's funny, light and sometimes quite sweet.<br />Average guy Tom is in his early thirties, lives in New York, has a rather pitiful rewriting job at Tabloid, enough money to live cushily, and a LOT of ex-girlfriends. He is a &quot;manboy&quot; who lives an essentially lonely existance despite the women who surround him, including platonic-but-might-become-more-pal Bran (and one particular male friend, a playboy called Shooter who dispenses love life advice).<br />Then... Tom goes out with Julia, a pretty feminine young woman whom he has silently longed for for months. Unfortunately, the following little dance-of-dates just frustrates Tom further, as he starts to clue in what kind of girl Julia really is (here's a hint -- she has a boyfriend already). But a sudden disaster might force Tom to change for real...<br />The basic mold of &quot;Love Monkey&quot; is shared with Nick Hornby's &quot;High Fidelity&quot; -- dissatisfying lives for thirtysomething males, who reflect on their failed relationships and vaguely problematic lives. Hey, Smith even mentions &quot;High Fidelity&quot; early on. The big difference between these two is the tone of the novel -- &quot;Love Monkey&quot; is a bit less sardonic, more comedic.<br />Smith does a good job of balancing out contradictions in a modern guy's life -- how to be real, and how to be the kind of guy that women say they like. He does a good job of taking a tangle of sex, pop culture, romance, questions about maturity (grow UP already!), and just what the heck it is Tom wants from his life. Most of the time he himself (Tom, not Smith) seems pretty confused about it.<br />Smith has a certain knack for snappy dialogue and genuinely funny comedic scenarios that will make you giggle and cringe at once. Tom takes awhile to grow on you, but he seems like a nice guy once you read on (much, I suspect, like his real-life counterparts). The supporting characters are all pretty sizzly; Shooter is an especially delicious character.<br />&quot;Love Monkey&quot; is the flip side of chick lit, relationship fiction about young men and their love lives and careers.

And, unlike with many books, the contents live up to it. Writer/NPR commentator/translator/airline attendant Hollis Gillespie shares nuggets of her life (and razor-edged wisdom) in this offbeat, zany memoir.<br />Gillespie draws readers into her life, past and present: Her three best pals are Lary (who offers to shoot her sometimes), Daniel (a likably weird artist) and Grant (gay bartender/seller of porno-religious signs made by an angry ex-nun). She struggles with horrible bleach jobs, jars of teeth,  imperfect German (&quot;It would please me greatly to purchase medicine for my fluid nostrils&quot;), and Myrtle the lesbian ghost.<br />She suffers the world's least dignified mugging, a visit to the Amsterdam red light district (rubber fists?), and the question of whether she flashed people when she was soused. At the same time, Gillespie deals with more touching topics. As the daughter of an alcoholic trailor-salesman and a kleptomaniac bomb-making mom who wanted to be a beautician, she describes her family's trials and distances, one of the last visits to her terminally ill mother, and how her young niece was hospitalized.<br />&quot;Bleachy-Haired Honky Bitch&quot; veers between wacky and touching, past and present. Gillespie's stories are less like a memoir or autobiography than like a collection of columns, loosely strung together. She also has the unique knack of being able to take little experiences, ramble about them in an engaging way, and wrap it up without losing her way.<br />Gillespie comes across as real and a bit twisted, like the zany pal of yours who lives down the street. Life keeps swinging at her, and she keeps dodging. Her tone is honest, endearingly self-deprecating, with a dose of sarcasm to keep her observations sharp. Backing her up are her likably eccentric pals, who serve as her partners in crime (translation: in ear-piercing and drinking).<br />Funny and poignant and strange, &quot;Bleachy-Haired Honky Bitch&quot; is a unique look at a witty woman who tells us of her personal storms.

The only detailed writing in the whole book (aside from nature descriptions) is how she describes the lost, forgotten people who can't get medical care, food or water.<br />\\"Choices\\" is also endowed with the sort of in-the-moment anecdotes, that makes you feel like Ullmann is handing out snapshots of her life -- her breakups, her safari with her young daughter, her work on an Ibsen play, and even how a rusty old wok hinted at a future breakup. She takes some looks backward in time as well, at her mother and grandmother, and at her daughter's time with her father.<br />\\"But within this framework I have choices, and I am described by the way I make or neglect them.\\" So says Ullmann, with the certainty of a woman who has made her \\"Choices.\\"	2004-03-30

Take the worst of fantasy and the worst of romance, and you have &quot;Rhapsody.&quot;<br />A boy called Gwydion is thrown back in time, promptly falls in love with a girl, sleeps with her, and is dragged back forward in time -- and learns that she must have died in a cataclysm long ago. Elsewhere, the pretty ex-prostitute Rhapsody is being stalked by a powerful thug who was once her &quot;client,&quot; whom she rescued a child from. She ends up escaping with a pair of mysterious mercenaries.<br />The three of them somehow go through the Root of the World-Tree, an enormous tree honored by the elf-like Lirin. Problem is, they then end up fourteen centuries in the future. But their enemies are still hot on their trail, and Rhapsody (with her array of superpowers) must somehow stop the forces of evil.<br />&quot;Rhapsody: Child of Blood&quot; combines the worst traits of romance and fantasy. All the romantic interests are hunks and babes. On the fantasy front, there are orc-like Bolg, evil priests in their evil temples, evil demons, elegant Lirin, creepy warlords, mysterious mercenaries -- basic staples of generic fantasy. It's like a D&amp;D game, only less fun. Rhapsody even has a magical sword (Daystar Clarion -- a name worthy of a seven-year-old writer).<br />It's undeniable that Hayden has a lovely prose style, although the book drags while the characters are in the Root. Her descriptions are detailed, gritty and have plenty of action, and the concept of &quot;Naming&quot; is a unique and interesting one. But her lack of subtlety destroys the atmosphere. The plot meanders all over the place. Grunthor, for no apparent reason, has a Cockney accent. And various attempts at comedy fall flat, such as a pickpocket who keeps grabbing a certain part of the male body.<br />Rhapsody herself is the biggest flaw in this book. She's pretty tolerable through the first part of the book, a part-Lirin ex-prostitute. But she becomes a hideous caricature after being &quot;purified&quot; by magical fire. Rhapsody is talented, kind, self-sacrificing, modest, charismatic, and so incredibly beautiful that a crowd follows her when she simply passes through a town.  Of the supporting characters, few have any noticeable dimensions. Only the lumpish Bolg Grunthor really has much personality.<br />Anything worthwhile in &quot;Rhapsody: Child of Blood&quot; has probably been done better elsewhere. Elizabeth Hayden's debut falls flat on its too-perfect face, a spastic collection of cliches. Painfully bad.ain part of the male body.<br />Rhapsody herself is the biggest flaw in this book.

The classic &quot;Lolita&quot; is paired with its own screenplay adaptation, and the comic &quot;Pnin&quot; and witty &quot;Pale Fire.&quot;<br />&quot;Lolita&quot; is the tale for which Nabokov is best known. The redundantly-named, middle-aged (dirty old man) Humbert Humbert is haunted by some teenage love he had long ago, and which he thinks he has refound in the prepubescent Delores Haze (called &quot;Lolita&quot; by Humbert). He sets out to seduce the unsuspecting girl, but her mom is standing in the way...<br />&quot;Pnin&quot; is a gently comic tale about Timofey Pnin, a timid, moderately neurotic Russian professor who now lives in the United States. He's amazed by technology, fussy, a bit weird about his health, and has problems with American train schedules. The unfortunate Pnin stumbles from one problem to another, trying to keep everything under control in uncontrollable circumstances.<br />&quot;Pale Fire&quot; is perhaps the best literary satire out there. Poet John Shade wrote the sprawling 999-line poem &quot;Pale Fire,&quot; shortly before being murdered. After his death, the poem is being painstakingly dissected and annotated by his neighbor, Charles Kinbote. Except Kinbote is a nutjob, who interprets &quot;Pale Fire&quot; as being all about him, and will come up with weird symbolism to justify his belief.<br />&quot;Lolita: A Screenplay&quot; is almost a different version of &quot;Lolita.&quot; Here Nabokov recounted the same events of the novel, but from an ominiscent perspective -- that of the person who would be watching the movie. Very rich, very well-adapted, very evocative for a screenplay, this is almost as good as a book in itself.<br />Nabokov could handle just about any kind of writing, this collection shows us. From the opulent poetry of &quot;Pale Fire&quot; to the solid screenplay, from the erotic drama of &quot;Lolita&quot; to the chuckling comedy of &quot;Pnin,&quot; he handles it all. His writing is detailed and lush, rich almost to the point of choking. He shifts perspectives, tells a story through annotation, sees through the eyes of a pedophile, and does it all with a certain winking flair.<br />Nabokov's writing is a combination of believable characterizations and rich language. Humbert Humbert, for example, is a horrendously believable person, especially since he makes constant excuses for his pedaphilic behavior -- the characterization is so good, in fact, that newcomers might even think (incorrectly) that Nabokov sympathized with the creep. At the same time, he creates the rather pitiful, absentminded Pnin, the self-serving nutcase Kinbote -- and they're all delightfully three-dimensional. You could bump into people like these on the bus at any time, and they would be just as he describes them.<br />Comedy, drama, satire and screenwriting are collected in the second Library of America collection of Nabokov's novels.

Keith Richards is a hard person to tie down into a biography, with his rollercoaster life and career. And not having access to him makes &quot;biographing&quot; even more difficult. Christopher Sandford's meandering focus and lack of new material make this an unsatisfying rock'n'roll experience.<br />Keith Richards was the pirate bad boy of the Rolling Stones. Without the outright sex appeal of Mick Jagger or the angel-faced nastiness of Brian Jones, Richards carved a niche by being himself -- strong, kind of shy, and devoted to making music. He rose to prominence as the brilliant guitar player and songwriter, ran off with Jones' much-abused girlfriend Anita Pallenberg, had two children, got hooked on heroin and finally turned his life around so he wouldn't lost it.<br />&quot;Satisfaction&quot; is anything but. Most of the information in &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is recycled from other books. And about halfway through the book, Sandford seems to get bored with his subject, writing a bunch of stuff about Bianca, Mick, and the other Stones, before meandering back to Keith, Anita and Patti Hansen. Not to mention that small errors pepper the text (Brian Jones had two illegitimate children who were older than Julian).<br />Most annoyingly, Sandford soft-pedals a lot of the controversy and news swirling around the Stones. He avoids talking much about the then-shocking music and statements they made, or the many small ways they tried to rub the anti-rock crowd the wrong way. It's like he doesn't want to admit that they were rock's bad boys at the time.<br />He does give good insights into different parts of Keith's life, such as his prematurely hard-edged son Marlon, or the appeal of ex-model/actress Anita Pallenberg. But his insights also seem recycled; it's as though he has difficulty understanding what motivates any of the people he writes about. His writing itself is dull and spiritless, almost patronizing, and the anecdotes tend to be either brief or garbled.<br />Keith Richards was better profiled in Victor Bockris's biographer.

One of Vladimir Nabokov's lesser-known works is &quot;Pnin,&quot; a gently comic story about a perpetually lost Russian expatriate and the chaos that is his life. Nabokov slyly lampoons America, expatriates, psychiatry and fussiness through Pnin, but he managed never to be mean-spirited about it.<br />Timofey Pnin is a timid professor of the Russian language at an American college, who moves every semester. Originally from Russia himself, he struggles with English, trains, appliances, dental work, and his relationship with his manipulative ex-wife, who insists that he give financial aid to her young son. The offbeat Russian expatriate drifts through his life, trying to arrange things the way they should be.<br />At first glance, Pnin looks like a clueless, absentminded loser. However, after Nabokov shows us his lost loves, his absurd little life, his reminiscences, we see him differently. Okay, he's still a clueless, absentminded loser. But he's a loser with depth! &quot;Pnin&quot; has pessimism, but there's a certain sense of comic optimism as well (despite Nabokov's explanation that he dislikes happy endings). Pnin's theme song should be &quot;I Will Survive.&quot;<br />Nabokov's writing is less rich here than in many of his other novels, in keeping with the humorous plot. Perhaps the funniest chapter is when he describes Victor's lack of psychiatric complexity, making fun of shrinks everywhere. But there's plenty of subtlety with the satire, such as the tragic story of Mira, a woman Pnin loved who was killed by Nazis. Or how Pnin washes the dishes after a disastrous party.<br />Pnin is ethical, generous and forgiving as well as fussy, picky and more than a little strange; he's perhaps the most sympathetic character Nabokov ever made. Nabokov pokes fun at Pnin while making us like him for his essential kindness. He's no buffoon, but a person who could really exist. The other characters aren't quite as vivid, although Victor (Pnin's ex-wife's son) is very good: the hapless artist son of two shrinks, who disappoints them by not having any weird complexes.<br />In the end, Nabokov's &quot;Pnin&quot; is a sort of personal Don Quixote who is dealing with the strangeness of his own life. Comical and a bit saddening, this is an undeservedly little-known book.hapless artist son of two shrinks, who disappoints them by not having any weird complexes.<br />In the end, Nabokov's &quot;Pnin&quot; is a sort of personal Don Quixote who is dealing with the strangeness of his own life.

Al In &quot;My Story,&quot; Bergman describes not only her working life, but the men she fell in love with and married (three wildly different men!), her four children, her ambitions (&quot;Joan of Arc&quot; was something she wanted to make for years), the scandals and the love that filled her career, and the cancer that ultimately ended her life.<br />Bergman's story has a candid quality that not many star autobiographies have. She had almost universal sympathy for others, such as her more difficult diectors and costars, or her ex-husbands. One moving passage has her describing how she wept at Rossellini's death, and was happy that third ex-husband Lars had become a father. Her writing isn't very detailed; at times, it's downright stilted. But it's pleasant enough to read, with elements of humor, of romance, of joy and sadness.<br />Between Bergman's anecdotes and stories, Burgess explains Bergman's life further, with &quot;Ingrid got this part&quot; or &quot;Ingrid went here&quot; or &quot;this person said this thing about Ingrid.&quot; He quotes her frequently, along with letters, costars, and plenty of other information that Bergman might not have remembered or known about. He fills in the gaps, so to speak.<br />Bergman's bright personality and Burgess's tight journalism make this a unique book, describing the life of a unique woman. &quot;My Story&quot; is definitely worth telling.	2004-03-29

A.S. Byatt's &quot;Matisse Stories&quot; have a similar effect (though the effect of Matisse and his artwork only really is established in the third story). A mixed bag of three stories, all focusing on women and Matisse's paintings.<br />&quot;Medusa's Ankles&quot; introduces us to an aging woman who is drawn into a hair salon by the &quot;rosy nude,&quot; a Matisse painting. Her semi-friendship with the hairdresser deteriorates when he leaves his middle-aged wife for a pretty young girlfriend, forcing the woman to face her own aging and life.&quot;Art Work&quot; introduces a very artistic couple and their eccentric housekeeper -- who has a few secrets of her own. And &quot;Chinese Lobster&quot; takes on the sobering topic of sexual harrassment, when a young art student files a suit against a visiting professor who is lecturing on Matisse. But it turns out that the student may be the problem...<br />Matisse is sometimes the center of these stories, but elsewhere you can barely find the poor guy. His paintings -- and the destruction of them -- is the center of &quot;Chinese Lobster.&quot; But his art is only a minor part of the other two stories. Byatt's flair for description doesn't fail her now -- she paints vivid, lush descriptions of restaurants, hair salons and past memories. At the same time, she adds small &quot;everyday&quot; touches like live lobsters, little dishes, paints.<br />While both &quot;Medusa's Ankles&quot; and &quot;Chinese Lobster&quot; are solid, self-contained little stories, &quot;Art Work&quot; is something of a mess. It seems to focus on too many subplots (Debbie's feelings about giving up her work, her husband's artwork) before settling on one. And her descriptions of art galleries and so forth seem rather off, as if she has never tussled with them and isn't sure how it happens.<br />While &quot;Art Work&quot; bogs down the overall effect somewhat, &quot;Matisse Stories&quot; is a charming little (very little) collection for fans of the French artist.

But he's suddenly called and told that Grim Tuesday has somehow called in debts of Mister Monday's -- including Arthur's entire world, among others. Houses are being mysteriously sold, creatures are swarming through his city, and the stock market is going wonky. So Arthur has to get back to the House and somehow get everything right again.<br />He narrowly escapes being attacked by one of Tuesday's minions, and ends up being dumped in the Far Reaches. There, he becomes an indentured servant to Tuesday, in an enormous Pit that mines Nothing, and is undermining the very foundations of the House. With the help of his friend Suzy Blue and a nautical captain (and Tuesday's discarded soot-eating eyebrow), he must somehow get the second key and second part of the Will -- or be destroyed by Tuesday.<br />Nix widens the scope of the world he introduced in &quot;Mister Monday.&quot; Now that we're acquainted with concepts like the House, the Will, and the different Days, he goes full-speed into the storyline. There are plenty of interesting hints about the future -- especially a communique from Lady Wednesday. What will Nix do next? Only time will tell.<br />This book is a little off-kilter -- the bureaucratic terms can make your head spin sometimes. What's more, Nix spends too much time focusing on zipping up with the Ascending Wings and clinging to the top. However, his descriptions of the mine are excellent, full of despair and misery. You can almost smell the soot and grime. Not to mention the hideous Nithlings, as creepy and sinister as anything out of Nix's classic dark fantasy &quot;Sabriel.&quot;<br />Grim Tuesday is an interesting villain in himself -- the ultimate plagiarizer, a guy who can't actually make things himself. So he copies other people's art and machines, and sells them. Arthur is still trying to fight against his destiny (just accept it, kid), and such memorable characters as Japheth the Thesaurus and the quirky Suzy appear to back him up.<br />While it drags at times, &quot;Grim Tuesday&quot; is still an intriguing, imaginative read with plenty of darkness and humor.

The delicate writing, interesting magic and likable hero serve to elevate this far above the Harry Potter series.<br />Henry is a shy, quiet boy who (like most kids) has various brief ambitions as to what he wants to be when he grows up. When he mentions wizardry to his mother, she sends him off to Wizards' Hall to learn magic. Things don't start off smoothly -- Henry is renamed Thornmallow (prickly on the outside and squishy inside), and he messes up even basic spells. Despite his failures, he tries hard.<br />But all is not well at Wizards' Hall. One night Thornmallow and his pals overhear a cold voice talking about taking over the Hall. Thornmallow is the one-hundred-and-thirteenth student needed to defeat the evil wizard Nettle and his quilted Beast... except that they don't really know how to stop Nettle. To save his friends, Thornmallow will have to call on magic he never knew he had.<br />Despite all the hype around the Harry Potter series, &quot;Wizard's Hall&quot; comes off as the superior story. &quot;Wizard's Hall&quot; has a kind of magical intimacy and subtle magic to the story, without any slam-bang effects. No sparkles, no fireworks.  Instead, everything about the Hall seems to have a bit of magic in it -- as does the writing.<br />Yolen's writing shimmers the moment she introduces us to the Hall. Her descriptions of things talking pictures, star-studded ceilings, soups with lizards swimming in them, and a small avalanche of snow and roses are astonishing, especially since she rarely goes into too much detail. Even the magic of this book is beautiful and subtle, based on singing and chanting. Reversely, there's the horrific Quilted Beast, which seems to be a perfect example of unnaturality.<br />Thornmallow is a likable little guy, quiet and definitely suffering from a confidence problem. It's hard not to feel for him as he struggles with his magic, and suffers the consequences of battling with Nettle. His friends and mentors are a quirky bunch, and Nettle's aura of evil is pronounced without being over-the-top.<br />Beautifully written and exquisitely plotted, &quot;Wizard's Hall&quot; far outstrips the Harry Potter series.

Now this kooky strip and its bizarre characters are back in this book, &quot;Liberty Meadows: Big Book of Love.&quot;<br />Welcome to Liberty Meadows, an animal preserve overseen by timid vet Frank and beautiful animal shrink Brandy. As Frank tries to muster the courage to ask Brandy out, the two of them also have to deal with the nutty animals there: a crazed Cow, Leslie the hypochondriac bullfrog, Ralph the tiny belligerant bear, Truman the water-fearing duck, and Dean the chauvinist pig in rehab.<br />This loony crew tries to deal with dates (where Brandy's crazed ex tries to kill Frank), the evil catfish Khan, camping trips with psychedelic mushrooms, falls into mine shafts, severed noses, truck-sized ticks, the insane stalker Cow kidnapping a celebrity and -- worst of all -- Dean's trip through the land of Cold Turkey.<br />You'd be hard-pressed to find a weirder comic strip than Liberty Meadows. Frank Cho combines the realistic drawing style (Frank and Brandy) with more traditional cartoon styles (the animals, and supporting humans like the handyman). Filled with wry pokes at pop culture and political correctness, it's refreshing and amusing in a sea of stale comics.<br />What sets this apart from &quot;Liberty Meadows: Eden&quot;? Despite the fact that the comics included are the same, there are also full-color Sunday strips. Not to mention a funny &quot;framing&quot; story: on the 100th anniversary of the Liberty Meadows sanctuary, a reporter is interviewing Ralph and Leslie (much older, but as crazed as ever).<br />If you weren't lucky enough to read &quot;Liberty Meadows&quot; during its stint in the papers, check out &quot;Liberty Meadows: Big Book of Love.&quot; Silly, weird, bizarre, and immensely entertaining, this is definitely worth a read.	2004-03-26

Author Vladimir Nabokov unearthed the extremely brief novel in his papers, 20 years after he dashed it off (and thought it was gone forever). It's &quot;Lolita&quot; before there was &quot;Lolita&quot;... but not quite as interesting.<br />The main character is a middle-aged, respectable, well-off man, living alone and lonely. He also has a distinct &quot;liking&quot; for teenage girls who are just hitting adolescence, but doesn't dare to try anything. One in particular catches his notice, a coltish girl on roller skates who talks to him at times and gains his affection and lust.<br />He proposes to the girl's widowed mother, who is terminally ill and pretty crabby; he has no interest in his &quot;monstrous bride&quot; but it's the only way he can get to the girl. The wife's condition gets worse over the following months, and she dies. And the man choreographs his own downfall as he plots to seduce his new stepdaughter...<br />The mind of a pedophile is a disgusting thing, and Nabokov makes no excuses for it. &quot;The Enchanter&quot; is a pretty straightforward story in comparison, without a lot of twists or surprises. It's far from a bad book, but it's not a terribly good one either. It's fairly ordinary, especially when compared to modern classic &quot;Lolita.&quot;<br />The high point of &quot;The Enchanter&quot; is the rambling thoughts of the lead character as the book opens. Then it dips down and proceeds more or less steadily.  Nabokov's lush language and complex symbolism aren't really very present here. His writing is blander and more straightforward, with a lack of polish.<br />The characters are given no names -- they're just the man, the girl, the wife. And the only characters we really get insight into are the lead character and the teenage girl. He's a lech, a creepy pedophile, with nothing good about him. Though he's the center of the novel it's impossible to feel any understanding for him, only a sort of disgusted pity. And Nabokov evoked that with a flair. And the girl is a sort of vibrant athlete that can be seen at any school.<br />&quot;The Enchanter&quot; is a sort of pale shadow of &quot;Lolita,&quot; a straightforward story about a pedophile and how his obsessions bring him down.

He was shipwrecked, then rescued by the wealthy Alabaster family. While continuing to study butterflies, he marries the beautiful eldest daughter Eugenia and for a time, lives the good life. The only problem is that unknown to him, Eugenia is wrapped up in a lifelong tangle of obsession and incest.<br />&quot;The Conjugial Angel&quot; introduces us to a group of mediums who gather to call up spirits.

Now she struggles with her past emotions, her present doubts, and her longing to communicate with her love again.<br />As in her prior works, Byatt's writing is almost dizzily lush. She has a good sense of detail, describing ribbons, moths, butterfly wings, and the flames of gaslights. But pretty words are not all that Byatt has to offer -- she makes use of poetry (her own, and that of others), Darwinism and religious faith, Swedenborg, a family whose opulence covers their decay, and the nuances of love. Not to mention the dialogue: Eugenia's rambling explanation about her relationship with her brother is chilling.<br />Perhaps best of this collection is that Byatt has a fantastic grasp on period descriptions and dialogue -- it all sounds like a novel from the 19th centuy, with the polish of a modern book. Which is not to say that &quot;Angels and Insects&quot; is perfect. Byatt spends a little too much time on the moths and too little on the Alabaster family. And she's not at her best in &quot;Conjugial Angel,&quot; which lacks the punch of the first novella. It's moving at the end, but takes awhile to get there.<br />Delving into such topics as survival of the fittest, poetry and love, Byatt produces a solid pair of novellas written in her usual sensuous prose.

It's a fluffy but enjoyable time travel adventure for cat-lovers and historical fantasy buffs alike; there's a little roughness around the edges, less detailed writing, but it's a pleasantly whimsical little trip through time.<br />Jason is up in his room after a fight with his mother and brother, with only his cat Gareth for company. To Jason's surprise, Gareth suddenly starts speaking to him. He is, surprisingly, a magical cat who can travel through time and space -- to any nine lives in the past. He takes Jason on a trip through time, to ancient Egypt where the boy-pharaoh wants to worship him; the Roman empire, where they are recruited by a legion and then captured by Celts; ancient Ireland, where they make enemies with a court magician and friends with a very special saint; Imperial Japan, where a young Emperor is given Gareth and a bunch of kittens as a gift; Renaissance Italy, where the two bump into a talented young painter;  Spanish-dominated Peru, where they befriend a scatterbrained, silver-tongued young captain; they introduce a special cat to the Isle of Man; witch-hunters in medieval Germany; and finally making friends with a kindly cat-peddler in 1775 Boston.<br />&quot;Time Cat&quot; has no central plot. Instead, it is a series of vignettes: A couple of chapters are devoted to each time period. It's like an extended daydream, displaying what are presumably the time periods that interest (or possibly frighten) Alexander himself. He also displays some educational material about cats -- how they were seen through history, things about Manx cats, and about all the roles that cats can play in a person's life.<br />Jason is a sympathetic kid, very quiet in nature (except for the brother-punching incident near the beginning) with some clear insights into cats and some fuzzier insights into history. Gareth is a cool, calm, wise, serene -- the ideal cat. And he talks too! There are too many supporting characters to cover adequately, but some stand out in particular, such as Diahan, the Irish princess who shows signs of Alexander's later heroine Eilonwy, and Don Diego, a scatterbrained, homesick young Spaniard who gets things wrong -- but a few things very right.<br />Even people who don't like time travel stories may like this one, for its lack of pretension or faked dilemmas. And for cat lovers, this is a delightful little historical treat.many supporting characters to cover adequately, but some stand out in particular, such as Diahan, the Irish princess who shows signs of Alexander's later heroine Eilonwy, and Don Diego, a scatterbrained, homesick young Spaniard who gets things wrong -- but a few things very right.<br />Even people who don't like time travel stories may like this one, for its lack of pretension or faked dilemmas.

And in Tom Grimes's funny, smart novel &quot;WILL@epicqwest.com,&quot; the edgy and smart are very much present. Only here, they're mixed with chemically-augmented satire -- an intoxicating mix.<br />Will is the 21st-century lost-long twin of Holden Caulfield: a depressed loser college student with a weird family, who also has enough medication in his body to open his own pharmacy. He's wrapped up in his own bizarre thoughts and lets schoolwork go to the wayside. Oh yes -- he has a quest to go on (get it? epicqwest.com?).<br />I.S. (Information Sickness) is &quot;a virus that makes people think, and occasionally laugh, too much,&quot; and kills them when it overloads their minds. Our anti-hero is out to stop the malevolent Dr. Bones and his sexy henchwoman, and save everyone from overload and imminent death. To save humankind (or something like that, Will joins forces with his talkative computer Spunk to stop Dr. Bones before it's too late.<br />&quot;Wacky&quot; is not usually a good word to associate with a satirical novel. But &quot;WILL@epicqwest.com&quot; has a certain sense of wackiness that keeps it from being heavy-handed. Grimes takes pokes at postmodern civilization: at sex, philosophy, computers, love, parents, capitalism, learning and drugs to keep us happy -- and it's all through the jaded eyes of a heavily medicated college student. It's either hysterically funny, or insanely scary.<br />Most cool genre-bending authors trip over their own efforts to be edgy and cool.  Grimes doesn't. While peppering the story with pop culture references, he excels in his writing -- at some times it seems like a straighforward first-person story. At other times, all those drugs in Will's system twist his viewpoint a little bit. The dialogue is amazing, especially during scenes where the characters are having major &quot;moments&quot; (&quot;I loved you even before I saw you airbrushed onto a haystack&quot;). Even the chapter titles are called things like &quot;Part Two, Chapter Two: In Which I Sate the Reader's Need for Narrative Drive, or Suffer the Wrath of the Marketplace.&quot;<br />Anti-hero Will is a witty, strange protagonist with unusual priorities. It's hard to summarize a guy whose brain takes up an entire book, and seems to spill over the edges. He's weird, and it works. And Spunk, the Pancho to Will's Don Quixote, is what makes the quest a winner, with his constant opinions and input. (Think C3-PO, but much less subserviant)<br />Sardonic and edgy, this is a must-read (especially for cynical students).

But early in her writing career, she also took a side-trip into young adult fiction in &quot;The Night Gift.&quot; It's a bittersweet little story about friendship, love, and the lives of a small group who are changed as they work for a friend.<br />The ugliness of his life -- and his room -- prompted Joe Takaoto to try to commit suicide. Now he's returning home from the hospital. His sister Barbara teams up with her friends Josclyn and Claudia to help make sure he doesn't harm himself again. When they stumble across a decrepit old house, they know what to do -- they will beautify a room in the house for him, painting it and filling it with fish, shells, and other things.<br />When the girls sneak a baby redwood down from the Basin, they meet handsome Neil, who gives them a ride back. Josclyn nurses a secret crush on Neil, and for awhile, she believes that he likes her too. But when he learns who Neil really likes, a rift is formed in their group. And when Joe returns to see the room, the group learns the truth about friendship and giving -- and receiving -- love.<br />&quot;The Night Gift&quot; is not a typical coming-of-age novel. There are plenty of realistic problems that aren't dealt with melodramatically (suicide, dropping out of school, first love), and McKillip's deft touch keeps things from ever getting cheesy or overemotional. The climax of the book is as quiet, delicate and saddening as anyone could hope for.<br />Her usually lush language is a little more toned down, but it springs out in descriptions of nature -- shooting stars, trees, and the decorated room. And her sense of atmosphere is also excellent. Joe, in some ways the focal point of the book, only appears in one scene, but his presence hangs over the entire book, save a few scenes that are all about an angsty love triangle.<br />Josclyn is a good protagonist, a frustrated student who faces losing a first love that wasn't really hers. Neil, the object of her affection, is a genuinely nice guy, not a heartbreaker; her brother Brian is a sardonic dropout with a heart of gold, and Claudia is the &quot;outcast&quot; with her low confidence. However, some of the supporting characters like the parents and Barbara could have used a bit more fleshing out.<br />Patricia McKillip avoids the traps of a typical young adult novel in &quot;Night Gift&quot;, with her sober looks at being a teenager, being a friend, and giving love and help to people who most need it.

Byatt's lush prose and dreamy storyline were among the best parts of her hit novel \\"Possession.\\" Unfortunately, her short stories don't quite live up to that standard. They are woven together with words and a delicate sense for what is beautiful, but seem as cold as the ice princess's skin.<br />\\"Crocodile Tears,\\" the strongest story in the collection, is a haunting, ambiguous little tale about a woman fleeing from where her husband died. So she goes to France and immerses herself in art, in beauty, and encounters a stranger with his own story to tell. Less compelling is \\"A Lamia in the Cevennes\\" (a painter encounters a magical snake), \\"Cold\\" (an ice princess has relationship problems with her hot-blooded desert husband), \\"Bag Lady\\" (a weird story about being at the mall), \\"Jael\\" (artists and the Biblical story), and \\"Christ in the House of Martha and Mary\\" (a cute little story about a cook).<br /><br />Generally short stories are written that way because they are too brief or insubstantial to stand as novels. \\"Elementals\\" is sunk in a velvety carpet of artistry, beauty and lush language. But it lacks a soul. Few of the characters, except for the lead of \\"Crocodile Tears,\\" have any depth or development. The rest seem like paper dolls.<br /><br />Byatt's writing is intoxicating; she takes the best of both prose and poetry (she can write both) and mixes them together. And in \\"Elementals,\\" she stretches her wings into different kinds of stories -- parables, stream-of-consciousness, human drama and fairy tales. Unfortunately, the handling of these stories is clumsy, especially in the tritely plotted \\"Cold\\" and instantly forgettable \\"A Lamia in the Cevennes.\\"<br /><br />Though \\"Elementals\\" is described as \\"stories of fire and ice,\\" ice dominates this cool, pretty little collection of stories. In the end, \\"Elementals\\" is elegantly-written but hollow.	2004-03-21

But it's too strained, limp and irritating to be more than self-conscious urban chic-lit.<br />Clarissa Alpert is twenty-eight (real age: thirty-one) and needs a husband. Since she has no skills, no independent income, and her dad may stop sending her money, she needs a rich husband before she hits her &quot;marry by&quot; date. She's slept with every rich'n'powerful guy in Hollywood, but the man she needs is rich producer Aaron Mason.<br />She dates him. They get married very quickly. She uses a turkey baster on their wedding night to make sure that she gets pregnant. But the next morning he reveals that his incredibly wealthy parents have disowned him, and they're going to live at a struggling-actor apartment complex. Clarissa, being quite spoiled, is appalled. But she struggles to maintain her life in the dingy apartment... until she learns that Aaron has some weird secrets of his own.<br />Hollywood is one of those places that just asks to be spoofed. And Grazer does a passable job. Her satire is over-the-top, but cute enough to be vaguely amusing. Not everybody there is like Clarissa and her cohorts, but there are enough that a book like &quot;Maneater&quot; is inevitable. So... whatever. Such satire is amusing in itself.<br />What &quot;Maneater&quot; lacks is good writing. It drags on a lot longer than it should, and too little gets accomplished. Once Clarissa marries Aaron, the only semi-surprising development is that she actually lives in the dingy apartment. Name-dropping, sex-related talk and plenty of whining fill in the gaps between plot developments. (Of which there aren't many)<br />Clarissa is a not-so-good character from the start. She's selfish, spoiled, vain, artificial and described as being sociopathic. So by the time she has a sudden change of heart, you may not care. You may want a Clarissa voodoo doll instead. Supporting characters are caricatures -- shallow pals, hunky ex-boyfriend, annoying quirky parents, and an equally annoying husband.<br />&quot;Maneater&quot; is an overlong piece of froth. Like Clarissa's mother, it's too thin and weird to be much more than a failed satire.a sudden change of heart, you may not care. You may want a Clarissa voodoo doll instead.

His discarded scribbles. His shopping lists. Just about every word J.R.R. Tolkien ever wrote has been carefully scrutinized and compiled into the &quot;History&quot; series. The finale of the series, &quot;The End of the Third Age,&quot; is a prized curiosity for fans.<br />It contains Tolkien's (sometimes garbled) notes and drafts of &quot;Return of the King.&quot; Different lines, altered characterizations, changed scenes, and a radically different Scouring of the Shire appear in these drafts. (Frodo killed &quot;Sharkey&quot; in earlier drafts) Christopher Tolkien provides plenty of explanation between nuggets of text about &quot;my father's&quot; writings. And the crowning touch is a couple drafts of the unused epilogue, in which we see Sam talking with his family.<br />People who aren't devoted fans of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; books may be completely befuddled by &quot;End of the Third Age.&quot; It's a fangeek thing, but it also serves as a literary curiosity. How did the story evolve, and how it was originally different? Well, this is part of what Tolkien wrote before the story was finished and published.<br />Tolkien's outstanding writing is hinted at even in the roughest, most incomplete fragments. And what makes this of special interest is not what was unfinished, but what was finished and not included. The epilogues (which were unfortunately not used) are beautiful, sweet and touching, and show Tolkien's love of family. They also serve as a better wrap-up to the trilogy.<br />The sweet epilogues lift &quot;End of the Third Age&quot; from a fan curiosity to a sort of &quot;director's cut&quot; book. For die-hard fans, it's a must-have. For casual fans, it's certainly something to check out.	2004-03-19

As a result, it's hard to come across both in such quantity as there is in &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot; (&quot;The New Life&quot;), the unsung masterpiece of poet Dante Alighieri, author of the classic Divina Comedia.<br />&quot;La Vita Nuova&quot; is a series of poems and anecdotes centering around the life-changing love of Dante for a young woman named Beatrice. The two first met when they were young children, of about eight. Dante instantly fell in love with her, but didn't really interact with her for several years. Over the years, Dante's almost supernatural love only increased in intensity, and he poured out his feelings (grief, adoration, fear) into several poems and sonnets. During an illness, he has a vision about mortality, himself, and his beloved Beatrice (&quot;One day, inevitably, even your most gracious Beatrice must die&quot;). Beatrice died at the age of twenty-four, and Dante committed himself to the memory of his muse.<br />It would be a hard task to find another book overflowing with such incredible love and passion as &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot;; it's probably the most romantic book I have ever seen. It's brief and only includes one part of Dante's life overall, but it's a truly unique love story. Dante and Beatrice were never romantically involved. In fact, both of them married other people.<br />But Dante's love for Beatrice shows itself to be more than infatuation or crush, because it never wanes -- in fact, it grows even stronger, including Love manifested as a nobleman in one of Dante's dreams. There is no element of physicality to the passion in &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot;; Dante talks about how beautiful Beatrice is, but that's only a sidenote. (We don't hear of any real details about her) And Dante's grief-stricken state when Beatrice dies (of what, we're never told) leads him to deep changes in his soul, and eventually peace. And though Beatrice died, because of Dante's love for her and her placement in the &quot;Comedia,&quot; she has achieved a kind of immortality.<br />One of the noticeable things about this book is that whenever something significant happens to Dante (good, bad, or neither), he immediately writes a poem about it. Some readers may be tempted to skip over the carefully constructed poems, but they shouldn't. Even if these intrude on the story, they show what Dante was feeling more clearly than his prose.<br />It's impossible to read this book and come out of it jaded about love or true passion. Not the sort of stuff in pulp romance novels, but love and passion that come straight from the heart and soul, in a unique and unusual love story.

Though at first it's rather confusing and hard to understand, by the halfway point Ullmann's delicate sensitivity is fully revealed.<br />Ullman describes (in alternating chapters) her life as a wealthy but unfulfilled star, and her childhood in Norway. It describes the collapse of her marriages, her love affair with reknowned director Ingmar Bergman, and the experiences of moviemaking and the life that surrounds it -- both the life of a star, and the life of a woman, a mother, and an artist.<br />The first third or so of &quot;Changing&quot; is incredibly difficult to read. It seems like Ullmann is picking more or less random incidents in her life and stringing them together out of chronological order. Some of the stuff, like anecdotes about her daughter Linn, feels unfinished, and it takes awhile to really understand what is going on.<br />But about halfway through the book, the picture starts to paint itself. Ullman's past and present link themselves together more fully, and you can start to appreciate the delicacy of her storytelling. She spends relatively little time focusing on the glamour of her profession. Most of those anecdotes are a blur. Instead, there are anecdotes about her struggle to finish her book, her guilt at leaving her daughter with nannies, how she acted, a walk in the rain with her daughter, her affection for the men in her life, and what she sees in people around her. Good, bad, sad, happy -- Ullmann seems to see it all.<br />Any woman called a muse (as Ullmann once was for Bergman) might find it difficult to stay humble. But Ullman manages it. She doesn't really describe herself so much as let the anecdotes describe her. Most of the time she seemed rather wistful and a bit lonely as she looked back over her life.<br />&quot;Changing&quot; seems like an appropriate title for a book about this actress's life in various stages. Ullman's biography is a deceptively simple, beautiful read from a unique woman.e an appropriate title for a book about this actress's life in various stages.

Most people, if they studied such languages, preferred the \\"dead\\" languages, not venturing into the world of more modern literature from countries like, oh, for example, Italy. That idea is the basis of talented Matthew Pearl's literate thriller \\"The Dante Club,\\" a rich blend of Dante's epic poem and a gritty murder mystery.<br />It's 1865, at Cambridge. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow is working on the first English translation of Dante Alighieri's \\"Divine Comedy,\\" and the other members of the Dante Club (J.T. Fields, James Russell Lowell, and Dr. Olivier Wendell Holmes) are backing him up in the face of controversy. Some people believe that this violent, powerful, foreign, implicitly Catholic work will somehow undermine the morals of Boston... or something like that.<br />A judge is found dead, eaten alive by South American maggots and flies. Later a corrupt minister is found buried upside-down with horribly burned feet. Only a few men -- the Dante Club -- recognize these horrific crimes for what they are. They're based on punishments from Dante's \\"Inferno.\\" No sooner has the Club scared away the man they think is the murderer, than another Dante-related death takes place. And if they don't hunt down the killer, both they and the Dante translation may end up dead...<br />Matthew Pearl writes like someone a lot older than he is. It's hard to believe that \\"Dante Club\\" is his first book, given the smoothness of it. And like Longfellow, he's unafraid to tackle weighty issues: racial prejudice after the Civil War (a smart young black cop who assists the Club), the capacity for evil, the power of literature, and the religious and social prejudices of the time.<br />Pearl does what seems impossible -- he juggles all these, never drops them, and never bogs down the book with them. Instead, it only makes a murder mystery an intelligent, thought-provoking novel. It takes a lot of guts and brains to link the Civil War in any way with the warring city-states of Dante's Italy, but Pearl does it. Not to mention making Longfellow one of his heroes -- a gutsy move if there ever was one.<br />\\"The Dante Club\\" starts off rather shakily -- despite the gruesome murders, it takes the plot awhile to start racing. But when it does, it becomes horrific, suspenseful and quite detailed. Pearl's love of Dante is what keeps all parts of the book tied together. It's obvious he's as interested in the Divine Comedy as any member of the club, and he's at his best when his characters are passionately describing Dante's works.<br />A nice detail is the Club itself. These guys aren't cops or detectives. They are poets, publishers and scholars. In the course of their investigation, they make mistakes, jump to conclusions and occasionally flip out. Dr. Holmes and James Lowell are the best characterized, but all the characters are nicely written. Longfellow is perhaps the most interesting, becoming obsessed with Dante's work after his wife's death.<br />\\"The Dante Club\\" is a rare book, a mix of mystery, fact and fiction, historical novel and literary ode.

But talented actor Viggo Mortensen is a man of many gifts -- poetry, photography, painting and music among them. &quot;SignLanguage&quot; is a unique blend of his art and what he captures on film.<br />In &quot;SignLanguage,&quot; he demonstrates his ability to take the ordinary -- bicycles, ferns, flowerpots, a dead fish and a baby's chubby legs -- and give it a mysterious, ethereal spin. Some are more posed, like &quot;Te Anu,&quot; a shot of costar Elijah Wood sitting in the snow. Others are more intimate like &quot;Fell,&quot; a haunting collage of light, shadow and leaves. You can sit and stare at that one all day.<br />Several photographs are from Mortensen's time in New Zealand shooting the fantasy epic &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; As a result, there are shots of New Zealand's beautiful scenery, such as a haunting shot of misty forests as pretty and ominous as anything in the films. Additionally, there are some pictures of Mortensen's castmates. These moments are captured with surprising delicacy, as if Mortensen has cropped away the outside world and just left in the images he wants his readers to see.<br />And peppered in with the photos are paintings: The layered, deceptively simple-looking &quot;Sun Losing Its Yellow,&quot; the haunting, darker &quot;Element of Surprise.&quot; Kevin Power's thought-provoking, intelligent essay on Mortensen's work is, if not a good summary, then a good springboard into the work itself. Certainly reading it puts you in the right frame of mind to fully appreciate Mortensen's work.<br />The meditative, capture-the-moment quality of Mortensen's work is one that is rare to find in any kind of art. And &quot;SignLanguage&quot; proves yet again that when it comes to Viggo Mortensen, still waters run deep.	2004-03-16

Among his early works was the Continental Op in &quot;The Dain Curse,&quot; a scattered but interesting three-tier mystery.<br />Diamonds have been stolen, and the Continental Op has been called in to find out what has happened. But he finds that the whole story that is given to him has a &quot;wrong&quot; feeling to it -- mysterious men, a diamond he finds on the ground. When the Op digs further, he finds a web of murder, jealousy and hate that spreads back over young Gabrielle Leggett's life.<br />After the trauma of her father's murder, the Op takes Gabrielle to the Temple of the Holy Grail, a San Francisco cult. At first it seems like a slightly goofy but harmless little pseudo-religion -- until a hideous specter in the Op's room, and a murder that seems to have been committed by Gabrielle, shows that something sinister is lurking there. And finally, the &quot;Dain curse&quot; seemingly strikes again when Gabrielle's young husband is found dead...<br />Before anyone knew about Sam Spade, Hammett was churning out pulp fiction about the Continental Op in his trademark spare, sharp prose. &quot;The Dain Curse&quot; feels like three loosely connected short stories -- only Gabrielle Leggett ties them together, and the idea of the &quot;Dain curse&quot; (which is never fully dealt with -- though it makes an enticing title) which supposedly kills everyone around Gabrielle.<br />Hammett's writing is as dry and spare as always. However, the stories sometimes seem too short, especially the second one, which ends on a hurried note (we're only told of Gabrielle's marriage as a sort of postscript). And the types of stories are uneven: one is a smart mystery, one is a thriller with a freako cult, and one is more a character study.<br />Gabrielle is hardly a compelling character at first; she's pretty helpless and dull. Hammett doesn't give her a lot of attention for the first and second stories. But she's given some good expansion in the final story, where her &quot;dope&quot; addiction is dealt with. At the same time, the seemingly amoral Op is given further depth. Though even he may not know it, the intense conversations in the last third show that he's a lot more than he seems.<br />&quot;The Dain Curse&quot; is a somewhat uneven mix of lurid mystery and practiced, intelligent suspense. Hardly Hammett's best, but worth checking out.pretty helpless and dull. Hammett doesn't give her a lot of attention for the first and second stories.

Though she loves her father, Meggie is puzzled by all the unanswered questions she has, like where her mother is and why Mo suddenly makes them move without warning, as if he's trying to escape something. One night a strange man -- Dustfinger -- arrives at Meggie's house, speaks with her father, and vanishes again.<br />The next morning, Mo and Meggie leave again suddenly to stay with eccentric Elinor, a tough woman with an obsessive love of books. Dustfinger comes along with them -- along with a mysterious green book that is, for some reason, very valuable. Meggie finds out just how valuable when her father is kidnapped by the thugs of the evil, sadistic Capricorn -- Mo is able to bring book characters out of their books and into the real world. And Capricorn is willing to use Meggie to make Mo do exactly what he wants.<br />&quot;Inkheart&quot; lacks some of the sparkle and memorable characters of &quot;Thief Lord.&quot; Despite this, it's a solid fantasy story that manages to transcend what sounds like a very silly storyline. Okay, reading people in (Meg's mother) and out (Capricorn and his deformed thugs) sounds absurd even in a fantasy book, but Funke manages to pull it off in believable fashion.<br />Funke's writing (very well translated) has a nice breadth of detail, and she gets across the personalities of the characters quite well (&quot;Capricorn would feed the bird to the cat on purpose, just to watch it being torn apart...&quot;). What it lacks is suspense and pacing. Funke is good at evoking mystery but not a building sense of suspense. And the book drags quite a bit near the beginning, although it picks up near the middle.<br />Meggie and Mo are nice but unassuming lead characters. There's really nothing that makes them stand out. Not so for Dustfinger and Elinor. Dustfinger is a tormented sometime-traitor who can't cope with living in our world, giving him a more pitiful personality. And Elinor is a take-charge, reclusive, tough book-lover whose odd behavior makes her more endearing.<br />&quot;Inkheart&quot; is a bit clumsier and draggier than Funke's first novel. But it stands as a pleasant little fantasy, especially for those who, like Meggie, adore books.near the beginning, although it picks up near the middle.<br />Meggie and Mo are nice but unassuming lead characters.

Ironically, they could easily have been from a different planet from the grungy, rebellious punks profiled in &quot;Punk: The Definitive Record of a Revolution.&quot; It's not definitive, and it's top-heavy with Sex Pistols stuff. But it's worth a look to get the feel of the punk life.<br />It starts off, oddly enough, with Andy Warhol and the collection of rich/artistic/beautiful freaks he collected in his Factory. One thing he did was sponsor the now-legendary Velvet Underground, which was the dark side of the rest of the music world. From the legacy of the Velvets came other bands who bent the rules, musically and stylistically (Iggy Pop and the Stooges, and the New York Dolls among them).<br />With Max's Kansas City and CBGB's as a sort of ground zero, punk bands of all kinds began to blossom. There's Blondie, Television, the Sex Pistols, Siouxie and the Banshees, the Clash, the Dead Boys, the Sex Pistols, the Ramones, Patti Smith, and did I mention the Sex Pistols? Additionally, they take a hard look at the roots of punk, the different kinds of bands there were, the magazines that covered it, the drugs that were done, what effect the music had and what the punks did.<br />&quot;Punk: The Definitive Record of a Revolution&quot; is a big, fat, clumsy, thick, aggressive-looking book that is almost impossible to read standing up. But if you can manage to keep the dang thing open, then you'll have a pretty good time watching as the punk revolution unfolds. It's basically a collection of quotes and interviews from all sorts of people who were around there at the time.<br />One thing that &quot;Punk&quot; stresses is that punk itself was not merely a kind of music or dressing. Merely having safety pins or funky hair does not make you . It was a mindset, a way of life and the way you acted towards the universe in general. And this is backed up -- quite a few of the photographs don't feature people in outrageous clothes, but their attitude is evident in their faces. Some are taking the whole idea seriously, some aren't.<br />What it lacks is enough stuff about the less rowdy aspects of punk -- what were they rebelling against? That's never quite clear. The outside world seems to be a haze for Colgrave and Sullivan. But they do give it their best. There are plenty of photographs that are worth checking out, many of them clear black-and-white candids (like the strangely pretty picture of Johnny Rotten and his &quot;chalice&quot;).<br />There's definitely a leaning towards the Sex Pistols, even though they were by no means the only, most lasting or most important punk band. But there's lots of information about just about every band, from the mysterious German Nico and the dark Velvet Underground to the rowdy and raucous later bands, and finally to the remnants of it today. (Gisele wearing a Sid Vicious T-shirt?)<br />&quot;Punk: The Definitive Record of a Revolution&quot; is a nice read about a now nearly-dead subculture. Die-hard fans of the Sex Pistols will run to read it, and fans of classic punk bands may want to give it a sniff, but a definitive history of punk it is not.he photographs don't feature people in outrageous clothes, but their attitude is evident in their faces.

Not just now in times of political turmoil, but anytime. Terry Pratchett gives it a comic spin in &quot;Jingo,&quot; with a simple message (War is Stupid!) and plenty of hijinks from the Watch.<br />A weathercock surfaces in the middle of the sea. Since weathercocks usually don't bob around by themselves, it turns out that it's attached to a new island that rises up out of the sea. Fishermen claim the island -- unfortunately, they are from two different lands: Ankh-Morpork and the desert land of Klatch. Soon both lands are at loggerheads over ownership of the new island, Leshp. (a sign in Ankh-Morpork: GREASY FORANE HANDS OFF LESHP) War is imminent, and unfortunately Vimes and his Watch are about to be dragged into it.<br />Diplomacy takes a nasty turn when Vimes meets (in his official capacity as a duke) a Klatchian prince and the sinister-seeming 71-Hour Ahmed. Soon the prince is injured, and Klatch is furious. Now the war has gotten personal, and is no longer just about Leshp. Vimes and Co. have to enlist the help of the eccentric Leonard of Quirm, while the Patrician somehow ends up enlisting a pair of unlikely spies: Nobby and Colon.<br />Any Discworld book that features the unattractive Nobby trying to do an exotic dance is worth checking out. But &quot;Jingo&quot; also has the advantage of lampooning just about everything connected with war: Racism, outdated ideas about how to make war, protests by stupid people, xenophobia foreign cultures (Vimes being offered the sheep's eyeball is a riot), politics, and those little time management computers (here called a &quot;disorganizer&quot;).<br />Don't worry -- Pratchett's dryly goofy humor is quite intact despite the messages woven in. From the Prid of Ankh-Morpork to Nobby's deficient love life, he peppers the story with the strange and hilarious. However, at times it dips a little into slapstick (Nobby in drag, getting in touch with his feminine side), and some scenes are more sitcom than satire. His writing is, as always, spare and clear, not too descriptive, and Pratchett manages to avoid banging readers over the head with his messages.<br />The crusty, hard-boiled Sam Vimes is back in full, here chafing at the idea of being a duke (especially if it means dressing up). Tough werewolf cop Angua gets to spread her wings a little, and supporting characters like 71-Hour Ahmed skim close to stereotypes, but just to make a point. Not to mention the hordes of weird recruits that the well-meaning, clueless Carrot manages to find.<br />War satire is a hard thing to write.

George Tremlett's biography &quot;David Bowie: Living on the Brink&quot; doesn't reveal much that's new, but he does manage to give a new spin to Bowie's story.<br />Author George Tremlett first encountered David Bowie (born David Jones) in the 1970s, as the talented young musician was blossoming into what would be a long and fruitful career. He chronicles Bowie's troubled family (including a family history of schizophrenia), Bowie being taken under the wing of Kenneth Pitt, his marriage to wild child Angela Bowie, and a colorful career that never failed to fascinate.<br />Most biographers either trash or glorify the people they are writing about. George Tremlett really does neither. Not for long, anyway. On one hand, he analyzes song lyrics, quibbles on Bowie's sexuality and sometimes makes excuses for dumb stunts. On the other, he is quite willing to chronicle Bowie's flaws -- his sometime insensitivity, coldness and weirdness. Bowie's complexity seems to fascinate Tremlett.<br />His writing is a hodgepodge of the conversational, the distant and professional, and his own experiences. It's a bit uneven, but it works. Most of the information is gleaned from other books; Tremlett gives it a slightly new outlook, refuting some rumors and questioning others. Thankfully, he does not try to spin up his conversations with Bowie into a friendship, as many rock journalists do.<br />Those looking for a trashy read will be sated by anecdotes like Bowie's two lovers (one male, one female) arguing over him, and the glitz, seediness and glamour of 1970s London. But Tremlett also covers a side of Bowie that you don't see often: the businessman. He tackles the complicated world of agents, music deals, bestselling records and everything that fills in the gaps. And he makes it clear that Bowie is not just an excellent musician, but a capable businessman as well.<br />Sometimes conversational, sometimes distant and professional, &quot;David Bowie: Living on the Brink&quot; is a nice solid read about the Man Who Fell To Earth. Recommended for fans of classic rock'n'roll, and Bowie himself.ician, but a capable businessman as well.<br />Sometimes conversational, sometimes distant and professional, &quot;David Bowie: Living on the Brink&quot; is a nice solid read about the Man Who Fell To Earth.

But Jean Harlow wasn't the person the public believed her to be, as revealed by &quot;Platinum Girl: The Life and Legends of Jean Harlow.&quot; It's serviceable, but not too much more.<br />Jean Harlow was born into an unhappy but not horrific family (her original name was Harlean) and jumped into a teen marriage while still at school. Her  marriage disintegrated as her star rose (nude photos didn't help), where her striking face and platinum hair made her a fashion icon -- something not hurt by legendary weird rich guy Howard Hughes. Two marriages, one husband's mysterious suicide, one scam and many movies later, the Platinum Girl suddenly died of kidney failure.<br />Eve Golden keeps a professional attitude towards Jean Harlow. There's plenty of focus on her mind, fears, hopes and her professional life. On the other hand, there's little of her sex life, and what Golden does dip into, she does to debunk (the freaky story about Harlow's brief marriage to her second husband). A tone of professional and personal respect -- but not fannishness -- permeates the book. A particularly nice touch is her emphasis on Harlow's early love of writing, which prompted her to write a novel later in life.<br />Harlow lived a comparatively peaceful life, with some tragedy and scandal but not a huge amount. A really good writer could manage to keep it moving. But Golden isn't a particularly adept writer; she gets rather tedious at times (enough about bleaching hair!), and fails to elaborate about some points like Harlow's slimy stepfather. She emphasizes Harlow's &quot;normality&quot; in the opening chapter, but doesn't really follow up on that. It seems like she's trying to get us to continue reading.<br />&quot;Platinum Girl: The Life of Legends of Jean Harlow&quot; is a nice but unimpressive work that describes the basics of Harlow's life. While the professional attitude towards Harlow's too-short life is refreshing, the mediocre writing bogs it down.onal attitude towards Harlow's too-short life is refreshing, the mediocre writing bogs it down.	2004-03-09

It's a flawed dark gem; there's a work of genius buried somewhere in the clumsiness.<br />Richard Papen somehow manages to get transferred from a culturally dead backwater in California, to the elite liberal arts college of Hampden in Vermont. Once there, he manages to get accepted into the tiny class of elite students who are studying Greek -- the charming gay Francis, obnoxious sponger Bunny, frightening super-intellect Henry and the beautiful, too-close twins Charles and Camilla.<br />At first, he tries to hide his impoverished origins and fit in with the beautiful, wealthy students who happily bounce off to Italy for vacation. But he soon learns that there is a dark edge to their love of ancient Greece -- the bacchanal, a barbaric ritual that ended in a man's death. And to keep the secret of that death, Richard will help his new friends kill again -- only this time, it's one of them who will die.<br />&quot;The Secret History&quot; is definitely a first novel. Donna Tartt writes with a sure hand and confidence, name-dropping just about every Greek and Roman scholar you can think of (also Milton and Donne for good measure). She has a way of writing that sweeps along in a tangle of beautiful words, glossing over the flaws those words have created, without losing the aura of Greek tragedy. It's less about the death of Bunny than it is about what his death does to the others. In short, this book is gorgeous. But it's far from perfect.<br />Her descriptions are almost peerless, very beautiful and haunted (mostly in keeping with the idea that &quot;beauty is terror&quot;). There are plenty of natural descriptions, from the snow in Richard's apartment to the stream Camilla plays in. Tartt certainly has the &quot;you are there&quot; factor in her ornate, detailed writing. The story is also impeccably paced, starting off slow and building up to the inevitable event.<br />Unfortunately, Tartt's details leave something to be desired. Her descriptions of the group are almost like a parody of elite college students. Why is Bunny talking about &quot;old top,&quot; &quot;old man,&quot; &quot;chum&quot; and so forth? Why does Californian Richard suddenly turn into a 19th-century preppie? Why is Francis wearing a pince-nez in the 1980s? And she goes way over the top in making Bunny &quot;dislikable&quot; -- he's a moocher, obnoxious, has a grating voice and is prejudiced against Catholics, Italians, gays, et cetera. It's as if his death has to be justified in Tartt's eyes by making him a huge pain in the butt.<br />Another flaw crops up in characterization. The little circle of students is shown as being coolly intelligent, cultured, and charming despite their fatal flaws. All other students -- all the &quot;ordinary&quot; people -- are coke-snorting, gauche, loud and stupid. Couldn't be some elitism there, could there? Richard is, unfortunately, a terrible lead character; he's not too bright, clueless, dull and self-pitying. His adoration of the rich, pretty and hedonistic never wears off. With the exception of the unfortunate Bunny, the others are intriguing rather than well-rounded, with their wildly varying personalities and hidden secrets.<br />Despite the elite literary edge, the core of &quot;Secret History&quot; is unsound.

Fans of Patricia McKillip will know to some degree to what to expect in her novels -- magical atmosphere and beautiful, totally original plots. In her latest novel, &quot;Alphabet of Thorn,&quot; McKillip delves into a strange language, and an invader who cannot be stopped.<br />The Twelve Crowns of Raine have a new queen -- very young, very timid and very unhappy. Lost in the shuffle is Nepenthe, a girl left to unravel old, mysterious alphabets. She was abandoned as a baby and raised in the library, and is quite happy there.  Her knack with languages comes into play when she gets a book from student mage Bourne, the nephew of a possibly treasonous nobleman. The book is written in a language made out of thorns that no one except Nepenthe can decipher.<br />It tells the story of the warrior emperor Axis and the sorcerer Kane -- except that the book also shows that Kane was a woman. She was Axis's cousin, lover and right hand. What makes the book puzzling is that Kane claims to have helped Axis conquer countries that hadn't existed yet. As Nepenthe struggles to uncover the mystery of Kane and Axis -- and her own origins -- the queen of Raine is warned... about the thorns that will destroy Raine.<br />Patricia McKillip's novels are both predictable and unpredictable -- you can expect lots of rich language, ornate kingdoms, and enticingly weird magic. At the same time, you can never predict how that magic is going to appear. In &quot;Alphabet of Thorn,&quot; McKillip tackles something old and something new, magicwise. On one hand, there's the floating magic school and stuff like that. On the other, there's Kane's frightening, majestic, bend-time-and-space magic.<br />As always, her writing is lush and slightly dreamy. McKillip includes lots of little details like peacock feathers, pearls, crumbly books, candles and pebbles. She revitalizes ideas like the abandoned person with a Hidden Identity, the long-dead king who will return in times of need (sort of a female King Arthur) or the disguised sorceress. The only downside is that when a certain part of Kane's story is revealed, Nepenthe's secret is also out in the open before it's actually revealed.<br />Nepenthe's a nice lead character, reluctant and confused without being self-pitying; her lover Bourne is rather less defined, but still good with his own confusion. Other supporting characters like the naive young queen, kindly librarion and the aging sorceress are nice supporting roles; Axis and Kane are rather lacking in dimension (king obsessed with conquering, and a sorceress obsessed with him) until the end. They seem as distant and weird as they do to Nepenthe.<br />McKillip expands her boundaries in the enticing, mysterious &quot;Alphabet of Thorn.&quot; It's an adult fairy tale that revitalizes the ye olde kingdom genre, and tells a good story while it's at it.rthur) or the disguised sorceress.

And Francesco Delbanco's debut novel \\"Ask Me Anything\\" is pretty darn earnest. While it suffers from some awkwardness typical of new authors, Delbanco has a good grip on what makes a tight, optimistic light book.<br />Rosalie is a familiar sort of character to chick-lit readers: Mid-twenties, aspiring actress, has guy troubles, confused, busy but with plenty of time to hang out with pals. But she's a bit different at heart, more contemplative and confident. Her day job is as an advice columnist for a fluffy girl magazine, GirlTalk, giving nuggets of wisdom to angsty teenagers.<br /><br />But the \\"Annie Answers\\" job is merely to support her way in a theatre troupe, First Borns, made up of rich kids, weirdos and sometime boyfriends. Rosalie is confronted with choices about her future and her heart: When other members of the First Borns start to get engaged, she finds herself falling into an affair with a fellow member's slick daddy.<br /><br />Genuinely ordinary lead characters are a rarity. And Delbanco keeps a hand firmly in \\"normal\\" turf while dabbling in the lives of the rich'n'glamorous of Manhatten. Rosalie is no spoiled rich kid. In fact, her style of living, brushing elbows with that of her wealthier friends, is pretty normal by comparison, and she isn't as preoccupied with designer stilettoes and trends as you'd expect. It offers no new insights about the present generation of young single women, but then, it never claimed to. Nor does it seem to try.<br /><br />Delbanco's writing is solid and nicely detailed, without the strained I-must-be-witty air of many similar books. Dialogue is her stumbling block; it's too contrived and self-conscious. She needs to just relax and let the words flow.

Your single smart woman in a job-from-hell, some quirky coworkers and plenty of witty little observations. It's a guilty pleasure with a literate twist and a likably wry main character.<br />Glossy magazine Fashionista is like &quot;Seinfeld&quot; -- it's about nothing. All they do is retread celebrity fashion of the moment, check out celebrity fashion of the past, and just about anything vapid involving celebrities. (Seeing a trend here?) Vig Morgan got involved in this magazine for the glamour, but finds that it's sadly lacking. Iron-rod editor-in-chief Jane McNeill is intent on keeping it vapid and celebrity-driven, even though her staff yearns to give the mag a little substance.<br />Then a rebellion starts brewing in the ranks. Vig finds herself turned into the linchpin of a conspiracy to get controversial fashion artist Gavin Marshall and his Gilding the Lily (or, to be blunter, &quot;Jesus in Drag&quot; -- Jesus statues in designer women's garb) exhibit into the magazine. But will the uproar be enough to overturn Jane?<br />Ever since the publication of &quot;The Nanny Diaries,&quot; there have been a slew of my-job-is-hell-and-my-boss-is-a-demon books. &quot;Fashionistas&quot; manages to avoid the pitfalls of most books like that. The biggest pit that it DOES fall into is the not-a-relationship that Vig has with the mysterious Alex Keller -- it really adds nothing to the book, and just seems to take up pages that could be devoted to catty power struggles.<br />Those catty power struggles are what make &quot;Fashionista&quot; so delicious at times. Vig's deadpan recounting of the quirky workplace characters is fun to read. While their oddities sometimes strain believability, they always manage to seem like people who could actually exist. And Messina does a decent job of lampooning the art world (Jesus statues with women's designer clothes), the fashion world, and magazines in general. Since she herself writes for magazines, it somehow doesn't seem surprising.<br />Vig actually seems like a smart, interesting female lead. She doesn't whine constantly about her weight, her boyfriend, and grimly takes it in stride when she has to cover Cate Blanchett's &quot;curly&quot; phase. Sort-of-boyfriend Alex is a nonentity, and so are quite a few of Vig's coworkers. Maya is a good sidekick for Vig: She's an emotional mess with unpublished novels, a nasty ex, and many stages of grief.<br />It's a nice beach-read.

While &quot;Laurel Bacall: By Myself&quot; covers much of Bacall's life, the centerpiece of it is her marriage to Humphrey Bogart. Here Bacall reflects back on her eventful life, relationship and how things are for her since.<br />Teenage Betty Bacall first saw Humphrey Bogart in &quot;Casablanca,&quot; and decidedly did not think he was sexy. But she started to think otherwise when she became a rising model-turned-starlet in Hollywood, a nervous budding It-girl. She met and befriended Bogart, then trapped in an alcoholic, abusive marriage with a woman he didn't love.<br />Their friendship quickly become a hidden love affair, despite their age difference. After his divorce from third wife Mayo, the two of them married and had two children, until Bogart's untimely death of cancer. Bacall chronicles her sorrow at his loss, and her life &quot;by herself.&quot;<br />Bacall does a good job with this biography. She writes her own life story as a smart but insecure woman who isn't afraid to reveal her embarrassments and flaws. She comes across as a lot stronger than she believes herself to be, though she falters quite a bit in middle-age. At times Bacall may frustrate readers by being somewhat clueless about her own relationships and marriages (drinking and marital discord).<br />&quot;By Myself&quot; is not exceptionally written, however; the style is quite plain and lacks quite a few details. Bacall compensates somewhat with her dry, self-deprecating wit and forthrightness. There's a bit of lingering displeasure with some people like her ex-husband and Bogart's ex-wife Mayo, but Bacall keeps any negative feelings strictly reined in, and her discreet.<br />Don't expect lots of dirt and dish -- Bacall clearly isn't interested in talking about glitz and tawdry little affairs people around her were having. Nor does she name-drop a lot -- after all, why would Lauren Bacall have to? Rather she's interested in the solid, serious romance she and Bogie had, and the day-to-day life of acting, and her family with her adoring, very supportive mother and her children.<br />This is &quot;old Hollywood&quot; as people like to remember it.

Now most of their failings are common knowledge. And in &quot;Golden Girls of MGM : Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Lana Turner, Judy Garland, Ava Gardner, Grace Kelly, and Others,&quot; Jane Ellen Wayne only soils their names more by making them dull.<br />Wayne opens each chapter with a coyly feeble teaser. She then gives a brief description of the women's lives and how they got into the movie biz, and what they did when they got there. Among these actresses: much-married Elizabeth Taylor, deceptively icy Grace Kelly, busty Lana Turner, fiery ex-Sinatra wife Ava Gardner, mysterious Greta Garbo, tragic Judy Garland, and some weren't quite so juicy (Katherine Hepburn, Hedy Lamarr, Esther Williams).<br />Why bother with one trashy biography when you can have a bunch all in one book? Be assured that Wayne will give you a detailed description of every lover, abortion, suicide, police-cover up and failed marriage that went on under Louis B. Mayer. Despite all this dirt, Wayne seems to be scared to have any strong opinions about anything (Joan Crawford is painted very blandly). You'll find every rumor -- true or not -- reported in various other trashy bios. Insights? New information? Decent writing? Not a trace.<br />&quot;Golden Girls&quot; fails even as a guilty pleasure. In a word, it's boring. Very boring. Gossip about stuff like affairs, abortions, failed marriages and massive scandals are related in the driest prose that Wayne can manage. She glosses over major events in these actresses' lives, but gives detailed transcripts of uninteresting personal conversations. It only makes her inept attempts at being coy painful. And it takes a special kind of ineptitude to make Katherine Hepburn so boring.<br />The worst kind of trashy biography is a dull one. And &quot;Golden Girls of MGM : Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Lana Turner, Judy Garland, Ava Gardner, Grace Kelly, and Others&quot; is very boring indeed.

Barron expanded his fantasy writing career after the critically acclaimed &quot;Heartlight,&quot; with the follow-up novel &quot;The Ancient One.&quot; His intense love of nature is melded together with modern concerns, time travel, legends and myths, and a cast of quirky supporting characters.<br />Kate is spending time with her Great-Aunt Melanie in the dying Oregon logging town of Blade. The people there are angry and afraid for their about-to-be-ditched jobs, and are threatening something Melanie is struggling to protect. Recently a giant volcanic crater was found to harbor a strange, &quot;lost&quot; land where the Halami Indians once dwelled. It's a mysterious, dangerous and beautiful place: There's a lake with a strange living island, a cursed spring that mesmerizes anyone who sees it -- and giant redwood trees that could keep the loggers employed for a year or two more.<br />When some of the loggers try to cut down the redwoods, Kate and Melanie set out to stop them. But when Kate takes Melanie's walking stick, she finds herself and logger's grandson Jody transported five hundred years into the past. After getting the help of a Halami girl, Kate struggles to find a way back to her own time. But to master the staff that took her back in time, she will have to battle the evil Gashra, an evil volcanic creature that threatens to destroy them all.<br />Showing concern for the natural world is nothing new in fantasy; it dates back to the Ents of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth. And it's pretty clear that Barron loves nature. At times &quot;Ancient One&quot; borders on preaching, but always manages to veer back; even the loggers aren't evil, just desperate and misguided. His story's simplicity and lack of twists would be a downside in most books, but it fails to slow down the pace or lose reader interest.  His enthusiasm is what keeps &quot;Ancient One&quot; moving forward and interesting, along with his unusual fantasy creations.<br />His lush descriptions of Oregon wildlife (both past and present) are loaded with detail, giving a you-are-there feel to it. Barron's writing is detailed all the time, and he's at his peak when he describes the natural surroundings. A comic vibe is added with the owl-like Tinnanis, especially their delicacy-addicted king (who is promised ten thousand peppermint drops by Kate). The scene where Kate confronts Gashra is rather too short, but is quite vivid nevertheless.<br />Kate is stronger in this outing than in &quot;Heartlight.&quot; Here she is more in control, more sure of herself, and less dependent on others; she's a heroine that boys and girls alike can relate to. Laioni is a bit flatter, but a good sidekick. Jody and Kandeldandel are both outstanding, a hardened logger boy and a flittery Tinnani.<br />Nature-lovers unite under &quot;The Ancient One.&quot; T.A. Barron's love of nature elevates what might have been an ordinary fantasy tale into a beautiful, beautiful thing. Highly recommended.Oregon wildlife (both past and present) are loaded with detail, giving a you-are-there feel to it.

759352:US	50881246	R2FMDYXCPAXK5M	0765343576	855912849	Sister Light, Sister Dark: Book One of the Great Alta Saga	Books	4	21	23	N	N	Unique epic	One of the best reprints produced by Starscape books has been the reissue of Jane Yolen's Alta trilogy, the first of which is &quot;Sister Light, Sister Dark.&quot; While it takes awhile to get going, this unique and imaginative fantasy book introduces us to a fantasy story that's both familiar and innovative.<br />Jenna was orphaned three times: Her mother died in childbirth, the midwife died while taking her away, and the warrior woman who adopted her was also killed. She's taken in collectively by the follows of Great Alta, a benevolent goddess. They're somewhat Amazonian -- there are no men in their &quot;hames,&quot; they are warriors, farmers, priestesses, and everything else that they need to be.<br />But Jenna is different from the rest. There's a prophecy that a white-haired child who lost three mothers is the Anna, a savior who will change everything. Events are set into motion when Jenna and her friend Pynt encounter teenage prince Carum in the woods, who is being hunted by a vicious warrior. Killing the warrior and saving Carum leads to destruction for Jenna's home and family...<br />Jane Yolen crafts a wonderful, believable place in the Dales. Not only is it very detailed and plausible-sounding, but she also sprinkles it with songs and historical studies. While the Alta series is often labelled &quot;feminist fantasy,&quot; there's no preaching or two-dimensional male characters. Yolen simply shows us Jenna and Pynt operating on the same level as Carum, and leaves it at that.<br />Her writing is earthy and has plenty of detail without bogging itself down. The concept of &quot;dark sisters&quot; (sort of a nighttime-only spiritual twin) is an unusual and well-crafted one. The only problem is that it takes quite some time for the plot to get moving, and it's a jolt when it finally does; we go from no action to all-action in an instant.<br />Jenna is an excellent reluctant lead. Her mixed feelings (she both wants and doesn't want to be the Anna) are quite plausible, as are her strength and gutsiness. She's not some sort of supergirl; she cries, feels pain and loneliness like anyone else. Pynt is a good sidekick, with her mischievous attitude. And Carum is a strong counterpart (and romantic interest) to Jenna.<br />Since &quot;Sister Light Sister Dark&quot; ends on an unfinished note, readers will want to check out the second volume of the trilogy (also available from Starscape) &quot;White Jenna.&quot; A unique epic fantasy.e plausible, as are her strength and gutsiness.

Experimental novel &quot;Pale Fire&quot; is a strange, haunting, magical experience, and as different from most novels as it can get. Like a textured surrealist painting, that is hard to take in on only one reading, let alone describe to someone who's never read it.<br />&quot;Pale Fire&quot; is a poem, 999 lines and divided into four cantos, written by poet John Shade. It's moving, vibrant and breathtaking. And it's posthumously annotated by scholar (and head case) Charles Kinbote, supposedly from the fictional Zembla (don't ask). In the &quot;backwoods,&quot; Kinbote overdissects and reexamines the strange poem. Increasingly he is drawn into the web of words, stuck on the poem and believing it to be about him.<br />A strain of subtle, dark humor runs through &quot;Pale Fire.&quot; Not funny-ha-ha humor, but one that only becomes apparent if you study it. In a nutshell, the humor here pokes at critics who read what they want to see into literature. Everyone has seen a passage or a line that strikes them to the soul. The entirety of &quot;Pale Fire&quot; does this to Kinbote, and his obsession with making it about himself is weirdly hypnotic.<br />Most unique (and funny) is the sort of analysis that Kinbote does of &quot;Pale Fire.&quot; It's overblown, unlikely, and tailored to his delusions. He sees what he wants to see, and tries to turn ordinary phrases into deep allusions, and even adjust the whole point of the poem. What else do literary analysts do? It's hilarious to see Kinbote bend, twist and mangle every little phrase to fit. After all, who hasn't heard that &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; is about World War II or the atom bomb? Or listened to a professor pinning a mess of Freudian theory on poor Hamlet?<br />The poem &quot;Pale Fire&quot; is the soul and core of this unorthodox novel. Perhaps only in A.S. Byatt's &quot;Possession&quot; does another poem so completely show the soul of a fictional character. Nabokov's poetry has the classic flavor of his prose. It's delicate and evocative without being overdescriptive. &quot;I was the shadow of the waxwing slain/In the false azure of the windowpane&quot; is among the loveliest excerpts, from the very beginning of the first canto.<br />And Nabokov's narrative is both dizzying and madly brilliant. He takes us on a ride into Kinbote's very, very disturbed mind and makes the journey stranger as the book goes on. At the same time, he crafts this as a puzzle. Not a mystery, a puzzle. Hints are dropped, questions are raised, and just try to dare to overanalyze any of it.<br />&quot;Pale Fire&quot; is a book that has to be read to be believed: A satire within a poem within a novel.

It's basically about marital bickering that lasts a lifetime, between two people who were never willing to work on what they had. Tyler has plenty of promise here, but it's bogged down by lackluster writing and a very by-the-numbers plot.<br />Michael Anton was a reserved Polish boy, who fell for the beautiful Pauline Barclay when he first met her in the early 1940s. She was suffering a minor injury from a patriotic demonstration, and he bandaged her wound. After the war is over, they marry, but they don't quite settle into suburban bliss. Why? Well, contrary to appearances, they are not suited to one another.<br />He is controlled, reserved and cold. She is ebullient and outgoing. And while some couples can make &quot;opposites attract,&quot; Michael and Pauline simply drive each other nuts. They have three children, cling to their ever-dying marriage over the years, until a family crisis involving their young daughter causes a permanent problem for these long-suffering &quot;amateurs.&quot;<br />Pauline and Michael, if they were real, would be ideal examples of why you should get to know your fiancee before you get married. In fact, forget that: don't even get engaged before knowing the person! &quot;Amateur Marriage&quot; succeeds in being a sobering, rather depressing look at a marriage that should never have taken place.<br />The biggest problem with this book is that it seems like Tyler wrote it on autopilot. The marriage's disintegration is pretty tedious to watch, and there's no feeling that it's building up to some sort of climax. When the book ends, it's not a relief or a shock -- just sort of &quot;oh, that's it.&quot; The fast-forwarding through the years of their marriage also makes it hard to get a handle on how things are going for them. Even the description of the cultural shifts of the sixties and seventies are, simply put, rather dull. Her writing is quite nice, but it fails to cover up the plodding plot.<br />It's also rather hard to really connect with the characters. Through the first third of the book, it seems like Pauline and Michael have plenty of promise. They're both closed off to one another, unwilling to heal the rifts, and thus perfectly suited to this novel. But unfortunately, they also get on the reader's nerves with their ceaseless bickering and superficiality.<br />The spark is missing in &quot;Amateur Marriage.&quot; Die hard fans of Tyler may run to read it, but it's unlikely to draw any new fans in with its plodding, poorly-utilized plot.to cover up the plodding plot.<br />It's also rather hard to really connect with the characters.

Angela Bowie's &quot;Backstage Passes: Life on the Wild Side With David Bowie&quot; aspires to be witty and caustic, but ends up merely sounding bitter, without revealing anything really worth knowing.<br />Bowie describes how she arrived on the music scene of the 1960s and met the budding singer David Bowie. After a very unconventional relationship, they married (he proposed by asking if she could deal with the fact that &quot;I don't love you&quot;?) into an open, bisexual union. A child, several albums and a drug addiction later, they split.<br />A gag order was part of the divorce settlement between Angela Bowie and her ex husband; this book was published once the order ran out. Alas, there really isn't anything to justify the order. She is bitter -- nobody could mistake that. But aside from intimate rashes and lack of sexual prowess, she really has nothing too grubby to say about David Bowie. Bowie apparently contents herself with acid-flecked comments whenever she can manage it. There are jilted ladies of the rock world (Marianne Faithfull, Bebe Buell) who handle themselves with decorum, but apparently Bowie doesn't want to.<br />The problem with Angela Bowie is that, like many paramours of rock stars, she assumes that she's a lot more interesting than she actually is. Her life is detailed, but not terribly interesting. What's worse, there's little contact with the intriguing people in the rock world. There's a spattering of stars like Mick Jagger who make real appearances (okay, we know Mick is a &quot;billy goat&quot; -- next shocking revelation!) and Michael Jackson, and others like Marianne Faithfull and John Lennon are mentioned but never really shown. Even Bowie's own ex-husband (the whole reason people read the book) is a nebulous presence.<br />Bowie's writing wobbles dangerously, with plenty of rants and flash-forwards, as well as her opinions on the music industry. There's a lot of sex and drugs, but not much rock'n'roll. If you want to hear about the various people who wanted to sleep with both Bowies, Angela will tell you gladly. Same with the gender-bending clothes. Unfortunately, you won't be told nearly so much about his music.<br />Readers may put down &quot;Backstage Passes: Life on the Wild Side With David Bowie&quot; wondering why the famed rock star bothered to put a gag order on Angel Bowie.

Parker's &quot;Rashomon Gate&quot; was a solid, multilayered mystery that strays away from the typical twentieth-century American/British settings. The attention to detail, humor and horror intertwine to make her second book &quot;The Hell Screen: A Mystery of Ancient Japan&quot; even more likable than the first.<br />Sugawara Akitada is returning to Heian Kyo (Kyoto) after a time as a provisional governer far from home. He rides ahead of his beloved wife and young son, since his mother is dying and he wants to get there before she does die. When he spends the night at a Buddhist monastery along the way, he hears a scream in the middle of the night -- and when he returns to Heian Kyo, he learns that a woman was murdered by her brother-in-law that night.<br />To make things even worse, his sister Akiko's new husband is accused of stealing imperial treasures. Looking for the stolen objects leads him back to the murdered woman, and a disturbing secret about his own family: His other sister, Yoshiko, is in love with the man who seems to have murdered his sister-in-law. Perhaps most horrifyingly, he will learn the grisly secret behind the monastery's graphic depiction of torture, the &quot;hell screen.&quot;<br />The basics of your average murder mystery are here: A lot of clues, coverups, clever tricks, red herrings, a persistent detective and a disgruntled cop. The setting is unusual in itself, since most mysteries don't dip into Heian-era Japan, which is shown in rich detail in &quot;Hell Screen.&quot; Parker has clearly done her research. She doesn't overwhelm you with too many details of her research, just letting it flow.<br />Parker also shows her ability to manage subplots: Akitada is distracted by his mother's rage toward him, and a startling secret about his parentage. We also get to see more of Genba and Tora, a pair of ex-ruffians who work for Akitada. There's also more humor in this book than in &quot;Rashomon Gate,&quot; as if Parker has loosened up. (Exhibit A: The imposing, obese acrobat, Miss Plumblossom, and what she does to poor Tora) As in the first book, there are multiple crimes with multiple guilty parties -- theft, cold-blooded financial murder, and even a serial killer.<br />Akitada is a good detective. He's smart and has a logical mind, while still being flawed; his carelessness almost gets him killed at one point. Tora and Genba serve as good backups, and police superintendent Kobe is still stubborn and unwilling to take Akitada's help. Additionally, Akitada's sister Yoshiko -- a minor character in the first book -- gets to go front and center when she tries to stand by her imprisoned lover.<br />Mystery fans will enjoy Parker's second mystery set in Heian-era Japan, and the likable hero and characters she's crafted for it. &quot;Hell Screen: A Mystery of Ancient Japan&quot; is a solid sequel, and highly recommended.(Exhibit A: The imposing, obese acrobat, Miss Plumblossom, and what she does to poor Tora) As in the first book, there are multiple crimes with multiple guilty parties -- theft, cold-blooded financial murder, and even a serial killer.<br />Akitada is a good detective.

Additionally, Akitada's sister Yoshiko -- a minor character in the first book -- gets to go front and center when she tries to stand by her imprisoned lover.<br />Mystery fans will enjoy Parker's second mystery set in Heian-era Japan, and the likable hero and characters she's crafted for it. &quot;Hell Screen: A Mystery of Ancient Japan&quot; is a solid sequel, and highly recommended.	2004-02-28

British books have an especial flavor, even if every one is compared to &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary.&quot; But Anna Maxted's sophomore novel &quot;Running in Heels&quot; falls flat even if you just compare it to itself--whiny, disjointed and annoying.<br />Babs is getting married. Her best friend Natalie is feeling abandoned and lonely, stuck in a relationship with a nice guy that she doesn't care about, and sure she is about to lose her best friend. Not-so-impulsively, Natalie gets involved with a sexy bad boy, then angers her brother by revealing his secret love child to their mom.<br />But that is only the start of Natalie's downward spiral. Her flirtation with anorexia becomes a full-blown eating disorder, as her love life becomes similarly... well, disordered. But despite Natalie's fears, Babs is still her friend through thick'n'thin (literally). And Babs is going to pull her buddy back from the depths and set things right.<br />The biggest problem with &quot;Running in Heels&quot; is that even Maxted doesn't seem to know what the plot is supposed to be. For awhile, it seems like this is going to be another cute, overwrought tale of love, lust, Mr. Wrongs and best female friends. Then, apparently desperate for more plot, Maxted taps into anorexia as a Big Hulking Problem. The transition isn't smooth. Instead it's like being yanked by the hair into a different book.<br />Maxted's writing has a rambling, rather random quality. While &quot;Running&quot; is obviously about a deeply messed-up person, the random strings of weird, self-absorbed thoughts are just annoying. The mind of an anorexic is a tangled place, but Maxted doesn't seem to know how to handle the actual problem. The solution for the anorexia is a cop-out.<br />Natalie's self-destruction might be a little easier to put up with, if she weren't such a pain. She whines, she's self-destructive, and her self-pity is overwhelming. Her boyfriends are virtual nonentities. The characters who come alive and make us like them are the ebullient, noisy, fun pal Babs, and the lovable gay boss Matt. A little more focus in them might have bounced &quot;Running&quot; up to being worthy.<br />Only a pair of quirky supporting characters save this book in any way.

In \\"Gollum: A Behind the Scenes Guide,\\" he talks frankly and easily about how this complex, difficult character was brought from the book to the screen.<br />Andy Serkis was unenthusiastic when he heard that they were searching for actors to play Gollum in \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" But after his now-wife began gushing about what a wonderful character Gollum was, he went in for an audition, armed only with a voice that sounded like his cat throwing up hairballs. Not only did Serkis get the role, he also learned that there was more needed for Gollum than just the voice: He had to suit up in a motion capture suit to provide Gollum's movements as well.<br />\\"Gollum: A Behind the Scenes Guide\\" is more than just a guide about how the first really convincing CGI character was created. Serkis also chronicles bits of his everyday life in New Zealand, the birth of his son, September 11th, the premiere of \\"Two Towers,\\" and the more widespread reaction to everybody's favorite Ring junkie (Gollum appeared on SNL and \\"The Simpsons, for example). Not to mention a sweet poem Serkis wrote to his young daughter.<br />To give further dimension to Serkis's story, there are lots of concept drawings and clay statues of Gollum (warning: avoid certain pages unless you're willing to see Gollum naked). There are also detailed sections written by Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, the mocap crew, and many others about how they also helped create Gollum. For example, there was a lot of thought given to what kind of nose Gollum should have, or whether he should have a potbelly.<br />Serkis has a nice, conversational style, with plenty of self-deprecating humor and excellent descriptions (\\"... suddenly this bald lunatic in pale green spandex comes lolloping into view. It was like a very bad nightmare, like a Dali painting gone wrong\\"). He's got a nice vocabulary and a great actor's sense, getting into Gollum's bald little head. And despite his claims of \\"ignorance of great literature,\\" he makes some nice references to Narnia, Shakespeare, Dickens, Hugo, and ancient Norse sagas.<br />Andy Serkis and the people at WETA created movie history with the flawless Gollum.

Teen author Christopher Paolini's &quot;Eragon&quot; is probably the most-publicized fantasy since the Harry Potter series. Is it as good as they say? In a word... no. Paolini has raw, unrefined talent and an undeniable flair for writing, but he's bogged down by every fantasy cliche in the book.<br />Eragon is an impoverished lad living with his uncle in a secluded village, barely scraping by. That changes when he finds a strange blue stone in the woods. He tries to sell it, with no luck -- it's harder than diamond, and no one knows what it is. Then it hatches -- into a baby dragon. When Eragon touches her, he accidently burns a scar into his hand and forms a mental bond that allows them to communicate without speaking.<br />He raises the dragon in secret, naming her Sephira, until his farm is attacked and his uncle Garrow murdered by the evil minions of the ex-Dragonrider Galbatorix, who is now the evil king. Seeking revenge, Eragon gets the help of the old storyteller Brom, who is more than he seems. When the new Dragonrider (Eragon, of course) sets off with his new friends, he sets out to deal with Galbatorix...<br />Is &quot;Eragon&quot; an amazing fantasy? No. Is it bad? Again, no. The handling of much-worn elements is clumsy but hints that he has promise. Paolini's writing has a certain eagerness that makes his story somewhat appealing, but fails to overcome his inexperience. The storyline is one that has been done elsewhere; it's a fairly standard S&amp;S quest-against-evil.<br />Nobody could accuse Paolini of being too innovative. Young, clueless hero raised by an uncle in the wildlands? Check. Wise old magical man who teaches the hero? Check. Ancient sword? Check. Dragons? Wise and fair elves? Evil magical villain? Stumpy, grumpy dwarves? Check. We've seen these all before, in fantasies ranging from &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; to &quot;Star Wars&quot;; there's even a bit of Ursula Le Guin's &quot;true names&quot; tossed in. Arguably this could be seen as a more fantastical retread of Arthurian legend, but that doesn't make it original.<br />What boosts up &quot;Eragon&quot; is the writing. Paolini has a genuine flair for description of landscapes and places, right down to the raging storms and burned-out villages. His writing is still a bit raw (some is horribly awkward), but he has a talent for writing action scenes and a solid ability to bring up what things look, smell, sound or feel like. He also has the ability to evoke emotions when the characters feel them, such as Eragon's grief when he sees Garrow dead.<br />Eragon himself is a pretty typical fantasy hero, rather angsty and uninformed. He's likable, but not really compelling yet. Saphira is rather spotty; sometimes she's alien and intriguing, and sometimes she seems almost like a human with scales. Brom is your typical old wizard who knows everything, and Arya your basic fair elf maid love-interest. Unfortunately she isn't really given much of a personality in the brief time we see her.<br />Paolini has some raw talent and a pleasant writing style, which keep &quot;Eragon&quot; from being truly annoying.

Fires. All these crop up in Douglas Coupland's atmospheric collection of essays and short stories, &quot;Polaroids From the Dead,&quot; topped by the picture of a curiously blank-faced Sharon Tate.<br />Coupland populates &quot;Polaroids&quot; with people who contemplate the past, and how it fringes on the present: mothers telling their children parables, an older woman revelling in a Dead concert, a younger group observing aging hippies. And he himself is in quite a bit of it. There are essays on Brentwood (the site of Marilyn Monroe's mysterious death), a trip to Germany post-Berlin Wall, a letter to late rocker Kurt Cobain, descriptions of Palo Alto, and musings on the human preoccupations with crime, celebrities, fame, aging, death, and dead celebrities.<br />&quot;Polaroids From The Dead&quot; seems like an apt title for this book. Each short story isn't really a story. There's no true beginning and no end. It's just a snippet that shows the outlook and some of the life of the people in it, and their thoughts. While this type of writing is very vivid while you're actually reading it, it makes the characters difficult to remember later. Likewise, the essays show one of the facets of Coupland's outlook. It's pensive, a little sad at times, and at other times just provokes your thoughts and makes you wonder.<br />Likewise, the black-and-white photographs sprinkled through the book are curiously intimate; some of them (like a burning stick of dynamite) don't make sense until you're partway through the story. OJ and Nicole, models of T-Rexes, the Vietnam monument, flowers and skeletons turn up in the photographs. They don't add a great deal, except perhaps to underline the words Coupland writes.<br />&quot;Polaroids From The Dead&quot; is a collection of snapshots of all kinds -- photos, experiences, and stories. Meditative, melancholy and atmospheric.	2004-02-22

Patricia Kennealy-Morrison has something all right, but her obnoxious attitude and sketchy details make it hard to regard &quot;Strange Days: My Life With And Without Jim Morrison&quot; as much more than a curiosity.<br />Kennealy-Morrison was a journalist/editor working for Jazz'n'Pop magazine in the late 1960s. She was sent in to interview legendary rock bad boy Jim Morrison of the Doors, and was immediately impressed by him (the feeling was mutual, she says). They soon struck up a friendship, then became lovers while remaining on opposite sides of the United States.<br />Morrison and Kennealy-Morrison wed in a witch handfasting some months later, despite the fact that Morrison was still with his longtime lover Pamela Courson. Kennealy-Morrison chronicles the remainder of their increasingly volatile relationship, her abortion, Morrison's mysterious death in Paris, and the production of the distorted movie adaptation by Oliver Stone.<br />Never has so much been written over so little. Not very often, anyway. Morrison's brief involvement with Kennealy-Morrison is blown up into an affair to rival Guinevere and Lancelot (her own comparison). What an unbiased reader sees is a rather average rock romance, full of the necessary sex, drugs and rock'n'roll. And lots and lots of Kennealy-Morrison's everyday life.<br />Kennealy-Morrison has a curiously self-centered view of the world: whenever anybody is less than friendly to her, they must be upset over her gender, brains, religion or relationship with Morrison. Her attitude (a bull getting ready to charge at a matador) wears thin quickly. She heaps scorn on almost all rock'n'roll stars, on any girl who slept (or wanted to) with Jim, on any friend of Pamela Courson's, on Doors fans, on rock audiences... pretty much everybody. Special vitriol is reserved for Pam; rather than take Morrison to task for his behavior, Kennealy-Morrison vents on the pleasant, clueless Courson.<br />While Kennealy-Morrison is clearly knowledgeable, she seems to use her IQ solely to set herself above the groupies. She lacks the class, wisdom and vibrance of other rock paramours like Marianne Faithfull. If this book is anything to go by, her intellect is stagnant and unsophisticated, and her personality is childish (she beats a groupie for coming on to Jim). In fact, her claims that she's a strong, decisive, take-no-guff woman becomes funny when you see that she was allowing a ridiculous amount of garbage from Morrison. There's no denying that Kennealy-Morrison is a talented writer. At times her lyrical, detailed writing makes this seem almost like a novel. It's especially vibrant during scenes like Doors concerts and the famous Woodstock. But too often her words are used as arrows rather than paintbrushes.<br />&quot;Strange Days: My Life With And Without Jim Morrison&quot; is a weird read. In the end, it's hard to see it as anything but Kennealy-Morrison's side of the story, but without any wisdom brought by time and thought.

The two first met when they were young children, of about eight. Dante instantly fell in love with her, but didn't really interact with her for several years. Over the years, Dante's almost supernatural love only increased in intensity, and he poured out his feelings (grief, adoration, fear) into several poems and sonnets. During an illness, he has a vision about mortality, himself, and his beloved Beatrice (&quot;One day, inevitably, even your most gracious Beatrice must die&quot;). Beatrice died at the age of twenty-four, and Dante committed himself to the memory of his muse.<br />It would be a hard task to find another book overflowing with such incredible love and passion as &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot;; it's probably the most romantic book I have ever seen. It's brief and only includes one part of Dante's life overall, but it's a truly unique love story. Dante and Beatrice were never romantically involved. In fact, both of them married other people.<br />But Dante's love for Beatrice shows itself to be more than infatuation or crush, because it never wanes -- in fact, it grows even stronger, including Love manifested as a nobleman in one of Dante's dreams. There is no element of physicality to the passion in &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot;; Dante talks about how beautiful Beatrice is, but that's only a sidenote. (We don't hear of any real details about her) And Dante's grief-stricken state when Beatrice dies (of what, we're never told) leads him to deep changes in his soul, and eventually peace. And though Beatrice died, because of Dante's love for her and her placement in the &quot;Comedia,&quot; she has achieved a kind of immortality.<br />One of the noticeable things about this book is that whenever something significant happens to Dante (good, bad, or neither), he immediately writes a poem about it. Some readers may be tempted to skip over the carefully constructed poems, but they shouldn't. Even if these intrude on the story, they show what Dante was feeling more clearly than his prose.<br />It's impossible to read this book and come out of it jaded about love or true passion. Not the sort of stuff in pulp romance novels, but love and passion that come straight from the heart and soul, in a unique and unusual love story. Every true romantic should read this book.use of Dante's love for her and her placement in the &quot;Comedia,&quot; she has achieved a kind of immortality.<br />One of the noticeable things about this book is that whenever something significant happens to Dante (good, bad, or neither), he immediately writes a poem about it.

In the wake of the hit movie trilogy, there have been plenty of books of photos and Middle-Earth info -- some good, some bad, some just blah. But don't start shunning the book displays just yet: &quot;Lord of the Rings: Weapons and Warfare&quot; has plenty of good information yet.<br />It handles the more militaristic aspects of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films: Loads of swords, arrows (like the giant uruk-hai crossbows called &quot;sappers&quot;), shields and armor. There are also the more unusual allies that our heroes pick up (the unstoppable dead army of Dunharrow), battle plans (a step-by-step examination of the Pelennor Fields battle), unconventional weapons (the mumakil or &quot;oliphaunts&quot;), and sinister fortresses (the Black Gate).<br />There's also relevant biographical info about certain people like Elrond, Eowyn, Faramir, Eomer and Aragorn, and it stretches back to the first film with its stuff about Weathertop and Isildur. And, as a bonus, the extremely articulate Christopher Lee (the amazing actor behind Saruman) writes a brief but bright foreword, in which he talks about his love for myth and fantasy, the Tolkien books, the movies, and finally about what he hopes &quot;Weapons and Warfare&quot; will offer to the readers.<br />Admit it -- even the most peaceful person gets a little thrill when watching a hero felling a dozen evil beasties with a big legendary sword. There's something intensely exciting about swords, arrows and all medieval warfare, however bloody and freaky it may be. &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; has an extra bonus: There's not only the multiple human civilizations (Gondorians, Rohirrim, Easterlings, Haradrim), but also Elves, Orcs, and Uruk-hai, as well as the ancient Numenorean civilization. More to love!<br />The only problem with the book is simple: those seeking information about how the authentic weapons, armor and war formations were created will be disappointed. So if you want to know about how they made all those weapons at Weta, how they managed to plan all those battles, you're out of luck.  And if you're a book purist, you will be equally out of luck -- it sticks close by the films.<br />Even people who aren't fans of military history may be intrigued by the level of detail and richness in the &quot;Lord of the Rings: Weapons and Warfare.&quot; And, of course, Rings fans should check this out pronto.ated will be disappointed.

But her brief Mermaid series is an excellent display of Takahashi's dark side, in a world where a handful of humans who eat mermaid flesh become immortal, and the rest turn into fishlike, monstrous creatures called &quot;lost souls.&quot;<br />Like the other two collections of Mermaid stories, &quot;Mermaid's Scar&quot; focuses on the immortal duo Mana and Yuta. In &quot;Dream's End,&quot; Mana encounters a lost soul who has somehow retained his human soul, turning him into a tormented monster. &quot;Mermaid's Promise&quot; brings Yuta back to where he once met a young girl who fell in love with him -- and who has somehow been brought back to life as a soulless creature. &quot;Mermaid's Scar&quot; brings Mana and Yuta to a town where a woman somehow recovered from deadly burns -- and discovers an immortal boy with a horrifying secret. &quot;The Ash Princess&quot; goes back to 17th-century Japan, when Yuta was still wandering alone. Here, he finds a travelling old man and his young daughter -- a girl brought to life with a mermaid's liver.<br />Perhaps the most common comparison to the Mermaid series is the action/fantasy/romance series &quot;Inuyasha.&quot; However, the Mermaid stories have none of the humor and goofiness that pop up in &quot;Inuyasha&quot; (although the story of the undead, tormented ex-girlfriend is quite familiar). The tone is melancholy, sometimes outright macabre, with a few sweet scenes of romance between the two immortals. Perhaps the best scene is the hauntingly lovely last moments with Nae and Yuta.<br />The relationship between Yuta and Mana is pure Takahashi -- they love each other but somehow won't admit it (and Mana gets pretty jealous at times). They stick with one another through thick and thin, and occasionally show little indications of how they actually feel. (&quot;It sounds like you've fallen for me,&quot; Yuta says half-jokingly at one point)<br />Takahashi's dark &quot;Mermaid's Scar&quot; is a fantastic mixture of dark fantasy and gently understated romance.

So in 1925, when four-year-old Michael lost his little toy dog on the beach, fantasy author J.R.R. Tolkien made up a story to comfort his son. It explained away the loss of the toy, and wove a magical story around a little dog named Rover.<br />Rover is an ordinary little puppy near the seaside in England, until he runs into a grumpy old man and ends up biting off part of his pants. The old man happens to be a wizard (Artaxerxes by name), and promptly transforms Rover into a toy dog (and no, I don't mean a tiny dog -- I mean a real toy). Rover subsequently gets picked up and sold to some little boys (presumably the Tolkien kids).<br />Fortunately, Rover encounters another magical being, a crusty, kindly sand-wizard named Psamathos. That wizard, in turn, gets Rover (who is renamed Roverandom) flown to the moon, where he spends time with the Man in the Moon and his winged dog Rover. And then he's heading off to encounter a talking whale, a mer-dog, a sea serpent -- and a dragon.<br />Like the vastly underrated &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham,&quot; &quot;Roverandom&quot; is a charming little bit of whimsy. No deep themes, no epic clashes, not even really a villain. The writing is charming and magical, with phrases like &quot;There was a cold wind blowing off the North Star&quot; sprinkled through it. It almost gives the feeling of being in another world. Best of all, in the middle of the book are Tolkien's own illustrations, cute little drawings and ethereal paintings.<br />Rover is well-named, since his adventures are all over the map and don't really progress from one to the other. It's merely a cute little dog roaming over the moon, the ocean, and the land, conversing with shrimps and bothering wizards. He's an outspoken little guy, but likeable. The grumpy wizards are also excellently done, reminiscent of Gandalf.<br />While &quot;Roverandom&quot; is a book aimed at children, adults may enjoy the whimsical humor and beautiful writing.

In the first book, \\"The Secret Country,\\" Pamela Dean draws readers into a magical story that brings to mind classics of the fantasy genre.<br />Patrick, Ruth, Ellen, Ted, and Laura have played at the \\"Secret\\" for almost a decade, weaving elaborate medieval fantasies full of magic, treachery, wizards, unicorns, sorceresses and plenty of political intrigue. But one day things change: Ted and Laura discover a house that wasn't there before, and a little sword with blue stones stuck in a hedge. The sword somehow pulls them into the Secret Country, where their games have become reality.<br />Patrick, Ruth and Ellen have also been pulled into the Secret Country, and now have the status and abilities of their fictional alter egos. But they don't have time to be excited about it, before being swept into a growing war and possible treachery. But the Secret Country now threatens to be more deadly than a mere game -- they don't know as much about the future events as they think, and they aren't sure how they can get back home.<br />While it sounds like a thousand D&D roleplaying novels, \\"Secret Country's\\" sense of humor and delicate writing elevate it beyond other novels where the heroes get sucked into their own fantasy world. But despite seemingly cutesy plot elements (unicorns) and names (\\"Well of the White Witch\\"), this book avoids being precious at any point.<br />The writing has the crisp quality of old favorites, bringing to mind classic fantasy authors like C.S. Lewis and Susan Cooper. With relatively few words she brings the book's events to life (\\"Ted was watching Matthew dismember some complicated shellfish\\"), with humor and plenty of detail. The contrast between the teenage heroes and the medieval lords is sharply defined by their speech and behavior.<br />At the start of the book, like in the Narnia Chronicles, it's a little hard to separate the individual leads from one another. But as the book progresses, they start to become distinct and vivid individually.

Sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll. Those three things make up the bulk of &quot;Walk This Way: The Autobiography of Aerosmith.&quot; And amazingly, that repetition doesn't make it bad. Rather it just adds a guilty pleasure tinge to one of the better rock band biographies out there.<br />They were some young boys from Boston who wanted to make music, but nobody could have guessed that they would become one of the biggest rock bands of the 70s. Girlfriends and wives, drugs of all kinds (one rock wife used cocaine as eyeliner), plenty of concerts and devoted fans, and a life of reckless excess caught to Aerosmith. They partied hard, and it almost destroyed them. Somehow they got their act back together, cleaned up, and are back rocking onstage.<br />Unlike the disappointing autobiography by the Rolling Stones, Aerosmith's book has a feeling of authenticity. You get the feeling that because of their wild pasts, this is a bit of a confession for them -- &quot;I was bad and this was what I did, and now I know I was an idiot.&quot; They give a sense of the day-to-day life of a major rock band, both the good and the bad. The level of detail is simply astounding -- and many little questions are answered. Wanna know why Steven started putting scarves on his mike stands? This book will tell you!<br />There are extensive, insightful interviews not only with Steven Tyler, Joe Perry other Aerosmith members, but with just about everyone they spent any time with during those years. Bebe Buell (mom of Steven's first daughter, movie star Liv), Teresa Tyler, Tim Collins, Liz Derringer, Jack Douglas, Elissa Perry, somebody called Rabbit, and lots of others. In fact, it gets a bit difficult to tell the not-so-prominent people apart at times. But it's good to see many different viewpoints, the best way of determining what kind of people they are.<br />Music aficionados, 70s buffs and Aerosmith fans will devour &quot;Walk This Way.&quot; It's not just a guilty pleasure, but a mesmerizingly grubby look at Aerosmith's pheonix-like life, destruction and resurrection.

One of the latest reprinted novels is &quot;Power of Three,&quot; a unique story about three very unusual siblings, and the Moor that is under attack.<br />The leader of the mound of Garholt has three children. Eldest Ayna has the Sight, and youngest Ceri has the Gift of Finding AND the Gift of Thought. The middle child, Gair, considers himself extremely ordinary, and tries to become wise and skilled to make up for his lack of extraordinary gifts. Gair isn't as ordinary as he had thought, but his secret talents lie hidden until a disaster falls.<br />Long ago, their uncle Orban killed a Dorig (a water-dwelling reptilian creature) for its golden collar, and the Dorig's brother laid a curse on everyone. Now the Dorig invade the mound when the chief is out on a hunt and the three kids manage to escape, taking refuge with the Giants (who are apparently ordinary human beings). They learn that they're running out of time -- the Moor will soon be turned into a lake, driving out the Giants and killing the Moung People and Dorig, unless they find a way to stop it.<br />&quot;Power of Three&quot; is in some ways a much darker book than many of Jones' others. There are more complex issues about morality and ethics. Not to mention the enviroment, and the question of what makes a person special. (Even before Gair's gift surfaces, he's considered special for his hunger for knowledge) There's murder, trickery, there are battles (not magical ones either), hostage situations and curses that affect entire populations.<br />Jones gives the Mound People a semi-Celtic flair; the story about how the kids' dad had to win their mom is reminiscent of old Irish legends. The shapeshifting, water-dwelling Dorig are suitably mysterious and alien. Jones fills her story with atmospheric wildlands, cozy British houses and plenty of vivid descriptions.<br />Gair is clearly the center of this book. He's a likable kid, quiet when his rotten cousin isn't taunting him, and more thoughtful than his siblings. Ayna and Ceri are also well-done. The biggest problem is probably Gerald and Brenda. While Jones does a passable job with these two, it takes awhile to warm up to them because we don't get a lot of insight into their thoughts.<br />&quot;Power of Three&quot; is a fast-paced, well-written fantasy adventure, full of strange and mysterious creatures (and a few who are all too familiar).

It's a vivid, poetic, bittersweet look at things like clinical depression, poverty, child abuse, and Linda Holeman does a wonderful job of bringing them to life.<br />Mercy lives with her mother Pearl and her Aunt Moo, both impoverished and eking out a meager living with the help of Moo's boyfriend Barry (known as B), who is off in Indonesia. One day, Mercy chops off her blonde hair and dyes it black. It's only one of the ways she is trying to harden herself against the ever-worsening conditions of her life: Her mother's sinking depression, her aunt's blossoming alcoholism, and B's sexual advances (and threats if she tells on him).<br />At her new school, Mercy has few friends, even though a girl called Andrea is trying to befriend her. The only people she really communicates with is her Italian-American boss, Vince, and the kindly Mamma Gio. But Mercy's already-difficult life takes a sharp downward turn when Pearl overdoses on pills, and B announces that he's returning.<br />Things are bad when &quot;Mercy's Birds&quot; starts, and they only improve near the end. Even then, it's not improvements that defy belief. Rather, it's about a fractured, battered family growing back together, and gaining a strong little circle of friends. There's no perky &quot;happily ever after,&quot; but things are winding up to become happier and brighter.<br />Holeman's writing is very vivid, and full of symbolism (such as the bright mask that Mercy creates, or her stiff black hair). She doesn't milk tragedy or sadness for sympathy, and the background she makes for each character is very realistic. And even though the world Mercy lives in is in some ways a very dark place, Holeman reminds us that dreams can still come true.<br />Mercy is not your typical troubled teen. As we see, her angst and anger are a way of coping with the very real problems of her life, especially problems she can't deal with alone. Her mom is virtually a nonentity, and Aunt Moo is at least trying to make an impression, even if she doesn't quite know how. Good supporting characters are the twinkly-eyed Italian widow Mama Gio and her son Vince.<br />&quot;Mercy's Birds&quot; is a unique book, and not one just for young adults.

The first volume of the talented Rumiko Takahashi's &quot;Ranma 1/2&quot; series introduces us to Ranma Saotome, a tough teenage martial artist, and one of the few guys for whom a cold shower actually works.<br />Genma Saotome and his son Ranma appear at the Tendo home, after a lifetime of martial arts training. If Ranma marries one of the Tendo girls, the future of their training center will be secure. Only one problem: Ranma turns out to be a girl accompanied by a panda. After youngest daughter Akane bumps into a naked boy in the bathroom, Ranma (now a strapping boy) reintroduces himself.<br />It turns out that Saotome Sr. and Jr. had a magical mishap in China's cursed springs, and now cold water turns Ranma into a girl, and his dad into a panda. Hot water restores them to their normal forms. He quickly finds himself affianced to Akane (who says she hates boys and calls him a pervert), and going to a school where the reigning athlete falls in love with him (in girl form) but wants to kill him (in boy form) To make things worse, an old schoolmate of Ranma's shows up with a mysterious grudge, fully planning to bash in Ranma's head.<br />As this was the beginning of the series, the first stories are also the shakiest, since they have to establish the story and characters. The artwork is a bit smudgier. And the characters are somewhat different than they are later in the series: Akane is more belligerent (not to mention long-haired), Soun more dignified, and the slapstick comedy is less prominent. But by the time Ryoga appears, the stories have gotten their footing. (The old bread battle is a riot)<br />Ranma is an essentially likable guy, even if he can be a jerk (such as saying that his girl body is better than Akane's); fans of Takahashi's &quot;Inuyasha&quot; series will see hints of that lead in Ranma. Akane's roughness is tempered with her teen crush on Dr. Tofu (who likes her sister). Supporting characters are given plenty of quirks that give them further dimension (like Ryoga's complete lack of direction -- he couldn't find his way out of a holey paper bag).<br />&quot;Ranma 1/2&quot; is an entertaining martial-arts romantic comedy, with likably strange characters and plenty of unlikely fight scenes.

If only the actual content of the book were half so interesting. Alas, it's mostly whiny, poorly written and makes rather feeble grabs for sympathy and understanding, but doesn't actually get either.<br />Andrea Sachs wants to be a writer for the New Yorker. But for any chance at that, she has to work as a personal assistant for Miranda Priestly, chief editor of the prestigious fashion magazine Runway. She doesn't like fashion (despite an overriding concern with top-notch brand names) but is willing to do it to move up the ladder of success.<br />Soon she discovers that Miranda is, in fact, a boss from hell. Lunch demands, business trips, and phone calls are all given a manic twist as Miranda makes demands that no human being should have to put up with. Is it going to get worse? And just how far into Hades can Miranda take Andrea before enough is enough?<br />Only fashionistas and wannabe-fashionistas will find this book a compelling read. It's not even a good beach read -- even beach reads are supposed to have some semblance of a plot, or likable characters. This thinly-veiled roman &agrave; clef seems only to be a chance for the author to portray her ex-boss Anna Wintour as evil incarnate (get it? &quot;Devil Wears Prada&quot; -- how deviously subtle!). Worst of all, we're supposed to pity a woman who is working at a Vogue-like mag as a first job, getting prestigious resume material, and is making a mint to boot. Cry me a river, you lucky dog.<br />The writing is quite unbalanced. Despite Andrea's supposed apathy towards fashion, the designer tag of every dress, jacket and shoe is put forward. Weisberger's writing has a certain fluffy charm, but it lacks in zest. Perhaps in time it will balance itself out and be genuinely engaging. At the moment, it's just moderately interesting, with some typos that made me blink in disbelief. (&quot;Heroine-chic&quot; was a joke, right?)<br />The only characters who you'll remember as you flip the last page are Andrea and Miranda; the others are thin paper dolls. Andrea is pretty thin herself (and I'm not talking about her weight). Her whiny, petty, self-centered behavior has the occasional good deed thrown in, but it isn't enough to make her likable. On the other hand, Miranda's over-the-top evil behavior is funnier than it is evil.<br />Like wearing an ill-fitting miniskirt, this book is unpleasant and kind of embarrassing. Roman &agrave; clef novels are rarely good, but this one is worse than most. The devil who wears Prada is the only truly interesting thing about this flimsy novel.joke, right?)<br />The only characters who you'll remember as you flip the last page are Andrea and Miranda; the others are thin paper dolls.

But the basis for that film was Witi Ihimaera's magical, lore-laden novel &quot;Whale Rider,&quot; a bittersweet story about a Maori girl and her mysterious destiny.<br />The first great-grandchild of the Maori chief Koro Apirana is born... but a girl called Kahu, not the hoped-for boy, and soon her mother dies. Koro is upset, since only a male can carry on the line. He hopes for a destined chosen one to restore the Maori people, but his hopes are growing more and more futile. He starts teaching young boys about the old traditions, looking for the one who can &quot;pull the sword from the stone.&quot;<br />Meanwhile, Kahu grows up into an inquisitive and sweet-natured eight-year-old. She loves her grandfather, but his bitterness over her not having been a boy has never really worn off. But one day, whales are found beaching themselves near the town where Kahu lives, and she hears their song. Searching for his old friend, master and rider, the oldest whale will find Kahu.<br />Few novels have the earnest simplicity that &quot;Whale Rider&quot; does. Ihimaera tackles subjects like tradition, sexism, faith, and of course the Maori culture. Not a lot of books and movies handle the Maori, who are the native people of New Zealand, and Ihimaera does an excellent job of conveying the creation myths, a handful of traditions, and the danger to it now (illustrated by Rawiri's journeys to Australia and Papua New Guinea).<br />Since the story is told through Kahu's biker uncle Rawiri, it takes us awhile to get to know Kahu. Similarly, the book is rather ordinary near the beginning, and the writing is too simple. But it grows in majesty, mystery and poetry as it progresses to its haunting, magical climax. Among the best parts of the book are the almost mythological sections devoted to an ancient whale who carried the Whale Rider long ago.<br />Kahu is a nebulous figure for much of the book, but flowers about halfway through, when Rawiri returns to New Zealand. Koro is an enigmatic character, crusty and grumpy, but is deeply concerned for his people and loves his granddaughter underneath it all. Nanny Flowers, who threatens to divorce Koro on at least a daily basis, is a wonderful character.<br />Sweet, beautifully written and memorable, &quot;Whale Rider&quot; is a memorable tale about traditions and culture, and about a little girl in white who rode a whale out to sea.ebulous figure for much of the book, but flowers about halfway through, when Rawiri returns to New Zealand.

Few Arthurian novels handle a complicated relationship the way Elizabeth Wein's story does, about two very different young boys.<br />Medraut is the son of King Artos and his sister Morgause -- a child of incest, who can never become High King. Instead, legitimate twins are born, Lleu and Goewin. When sickly Lleu is fourteen, Medraut arrives to find him terribly sick. He heals his half-brother, and stays with the High King's family. This gets him away from his malevolent mother, but it's hard for him: He envies Lleu's position, his authority, and the fact that he won't kill even an animal. He isn't suited to be High King, but Medraut is.<br />But things get even worse. A disaster causes Artos to strip Medraut of his authority. And Morgause arrives for a visit -- and Medraut finds out that she is poisoning Lleu, hoping that if he dies, Medraut will become the king's heir. But a fight with Lleu, and an offer from Morgause, will drive Medraut to desperate lengths, in which the hunter will become the prey.<br />&quot;Winter Prince&quot; has a delicacy and harshness to the story. It's a story about two brothers who envy and love one another, and how they struggle to deal with their feelings. What's more, they're not just competing for the sense of who is on top, but also for Arthur's affection and acceptance. Lleu has it, Medraut wants it. It's a weird, complicated relationship, made even more so by Medraut's bitterness and Lleu's moderate brattiness.<br />Having the book written as a long story told from Medraut to Morgause (whose incestuous pursuits don't end with her brother) also makes it seem like he's finally exorcising his demons. The writing is detailed and almost like a dream at times, especially during the chapters with Lleu and Medraut alone in the woods.<br />Medraut is wonderfully-written; he's tormented and bitter, but it's impossible not to sympathize with this guy. Lleu is more of an enigma, but is also sharply-written and very vivid, a different kind of person. Morgause is a walking poison pillar, exactly as she should be; Artos, Ginevra and most of the other supporting characters are rather nebulous.<br />&quot;Winter Prince&quot; is a bittersweet little tale that has rightly been brought back onto bookshelves. It's a unique twist on the typical Arthurian story, full of darkness and light. Highly recommended.t it's impossible not to sympathize with this guy.

That book is included here, along with the confusing &quot;Red Harvest&quot; and magnificent, polished &quot;Thin Man,&quot; two other crime novels by Hammett.<br />The mysterious &quot;Maltese Falcon&quot; is at the center of international intrigue -- and murder. Cynical Sam Spade and his partner Miles Archer are hired by a beautiful, seemingly helpless woman to find a man who she says has run off with her sister. Not only is the woman lying, but someone kills Archer. A slimy fop, a cultured gangster, and a breathy femme fatale are all in the same web of crime and murder, centered on a bejewelled bird called the Maltese Falcon.<br />&quot;Red Harvest&quot; is the full-length novel introduction of the cool-as-ice Continental Op. He travels to Personville (or &quot;Poisonville,&quot; depending on your accent) to meet a client. Except the client has just been murdered. Rather than go home to San Francisco, the Continental Op meets the dead man's wealthy father, and begins a one-man battle against the vicious gangsters who control Personville. But the death and mayhem draw him in, threatening his life as he struggles to stay afloat.<br />&quot;The Thin Man&quot; was Hammett's last and lightest novel. Nick and Nora Charles are a wealthy couple who have a weird kind of compatibility, but ex-private-eye Nick is through with crime solving. Or so he thinks. One day when Nick is out drinking, he encounters young Dorothy Wynant, daughter of peculiar inventor Clyde Wynant. Her dad has vanished, and soon his secretary/mistress is found dead. Nick finds himself sucked unwillingly into a sordid, messy crime that will leave more murdered bodies behind it.<br />This collection shows the unevenness of Hammett's writing at times. &quot;Maltese Falcon&quot; and &quot;Thin Man&quot; are complicated and polished, while &quot;Red Harvest&quot; is a dense mass of shootings, conspiracies and mysterious crimes. What they all have in common is tense, sparse writing, and hardened, cynical anti-heroes who are surrounded by other ambiguous characters.<br />The three-pack of &quot;The Maltese Falcon,&quot; &quot;The Thin Man,&quot; and &quot;Red Harvest&quot; is a good way to introduce yourself to Hammett's gritty, engrossing crime novels.

It's a twist on the boy-meets-girl story, in which the girl is a haunted widow and the boy is a struggling college student.<br />Yusaku Godai's life changed forever when the beautiful Kyoko became manager of the rundown Maison Ikkoku. His attempts to get closer to her were thwarted when he learned that her beloved husband died not long ago. Now he has another problem -- Shun Mitaka. He's rich, handsome, debonair, nice, and he's in love with Kyoko too.<br />To make things even more complicated, Yusaku has to deal with Kozue, a girl he once worked with who has a massive crush on him. He likes Kozue, but not that way. Misunderstandings about restaurants, dog phobias, stinging jellyfish, puppet shows and a sprained ankle make Yusaku's life even harder -- and that's not including his crazy, obnoxious neighbors.<br />&quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; is hard to describe -- it's a little too dramatic to be a romantic comedy, but too funny to be a straightforward drama. There are a lot of situations that Takahashi does well and often, like Yusaku bursting in on the bathing Kyoko. The story is more streamlined and fluid, and even the dramatic interludes burst into comedy quickly enough (usually because of the crazy inhabitants of Maison Ikkoku).<br />Yusaku grows up a little, gaining confidence and backbone (although he's still  a pushover). Kyoko's jealousy and temper are shown more vividly here, when she thinks Yusaku is playing around with several girls. And one of the nicest things about Takahashi's work is that romantic rivals are not portrayed as mean or bad. Mitaka and Kozue aren't bad people, just unfortunately in love with the protagonists. They both actually seem quite pleasant, especially the dog-phobic Mitaka (which presents a major obstacle to a relationship with Kyoko).<br />Both longtime fans and newcomers will enjoy the second volume of &quot;Maison Ikkoku,&quot; with all its embarrassing humor and sweet romance.

It's kind of like quicksand -- it may suck you in, but you won't like it a bit.<br />Little Robin Cleve was murdered. Nobody knows who did it (reports of what the &quot;suspicious man&quot; supposedly spotted nearby vary). This crime essentially fractured his family, turning his mom into a hermit, drove away his father, and sending his two sisters into the care of a maid and some (of course) maiden aunts. Twelve years after Robin's death, the trail is cold, but that doesn't stop his sister Harriet from searching for the murderer.<br />Who is it? Harriet decides that it must be Danny Ratliff, one of a family of criminals. (Why does she decide this? Don't ask -- there is no rational reason) Recruiting the help of a friend, Harriet begins trying to get to Danny, to prove that he murdered her brother. Soon she is stalking the Ratliffs -- and takes actions that will change her life forever.<br />&quot;The Little Friend&quot; was a highly anticipated second novel, after the darkly, wittily literate &quot;Secret History.&quot; That was written ten years ago, and apparently &quot;Friend&quot; is what Tartt has been occupying herself with since then. Sometimes this book almost reads like a parody of the Southern gothic books, except that Tartt is serious. Really serious. Dead serious. (Look at her picture in the book flap if you don't believe me) A heavy, significant air lies over the entire novel, but the ending is empty and the plot is left flapping in the breeze. Who dunnit? If Tartt herself knows, she ain't telling.<br />Many much-hyped novels read like first drafts, but this doesn't even rise that high. It writes like a book that was started and written for the heck of it, with no real planning or ending in mind. Tartt seems less interested in evoking images or feelings in her readers, than she is in seeing how many words she can use to describe something of no consequence. There are lots of rambling, overlong sentences that trip over themselves.<br />Harriet's precocious intelligence is apparently supposed to impress us. Instead, it seems like she's Tartt's alter ego -- very cynical, obnoxious and a know-it-all. The supporting characters are paper dolls. And when they aren't two-dimensional, they're hampered by so many cliches that they are impossible to take seriously. (Why must every book of this kind have little old maiden aunts? What's with the African-American and redneck stereotypes?) What's more, they're boring. Like the sister Allison, they're prettily written but washed out and colorless.<br />&quot;Little Friend&quot; might have just been boring and plodding, if it had had a real ending. But it doesn't.

Instead, it seems like she's Tartt's alter ego -- very cynical, obnoxious and a know-it-all. The supporting characters are paper dolls. And when they aren't two-dimensional, they're hampered by so many cliches that they are impossible to take seriously. (Why must every book of this kind have little old maiden aunts? What's with the African-American and redneck stereotypes?) What's more, they're boring. Like the sister Allison, they're prettily written but washed out and colorless.<br />&quot;Little Friend&quot; might have just been boring and plodding, if it had had a real ending. But it doesn't. Instead of being a mystery, a thriller, or a character study, it's just a big soggy lumpy mess. Embarrassing, plotless and leaves a very sour taste in the mouth.	2004-01-21

This collection includes both -- the stories about Damar, &quot;The Hero and the Crown&quot; and &quot;The Blue Sword,&quot; and Sleeping Beauty with a twist in &quot;Spindle's End.&quot;<br />&quot;The Blue Sword&quot; introduces us to Harry (Angharad) Crewe, a bored, rather plain young woman in the remote colony of Daria. That changes when she encounters Corlath, the golden-eyed Hill-King of Damar, and the powerful young man realizes that she is a part of his future. So he kidnaps her, and Hary soon begins experiencing visions of the hero queen of Damar, Aerin -- and those visions will lead her to her destiny.<br />&quot;The Hero and the Crown&quot; is the story of Aerin, the daughter of a king and a witch -- allowed to remain, but never accepted. Despite this, she yearns to be a hero, and her discovery of a fireproofing agent gives her the chance to be one. After slaying the Black Dragon, an ancient monster, Aerin pays a price and must go to the mysterious wizard Luthe for help -- only to find herself embroiled in a battle against a dangerous foe.<br />&quot;Spindle's End&quot; takes readers to a lighter place. Princess Rosie is under a curse put on her by an evil fairy: on her 21st birthday, she will prick her finger on a spindle and die. In an effort to save her, Rosie is given to matter-of-fact good fairy Katriona, and grows up as a strong, independent girl who can speak to animals (a remarkably well-done touch) and assists a blacksmith. Needless to say, things get complex as the deadline for the curse approaches...<br />The range of McKinley's writing is shown in this collection. &quot;Hero&quot; and &quot;Sword&quot; are grittier, more complex, more mature and more nuanced. Damar is a lot like India, and McKinley clearly worked on making the cultures and conflicts believable, while dashing in some interesting magic. &quot;Spindle's End&quot; is frothier and lighter. The kingdom is more generic, and the magic more cutesy. But all the books have quirky, unconventional heroines, realistic animals (especially horses), and detailed writing.<br />Robin McKinley's works usually hit the mark, whether they are light and sweet or darker and grittier. This collection will entertain and amuse fantasy fans who appreciate a sword, a strong hero (of either gender), and plenty of unusual twists.ndle's End&quot; is frothier and lighter.

With the fate of Middle-Earth -- and his beloved Arwen's life -- on the line, Aragorn fully accepts his fate as Gondor's future king, and recruits the help of a long-dead army. And Gandalf takes the hobbit Pippin to the ravaged land of Gondor, the last stronghold against Sauron.<br />The actual climax and precise endings of the film are left up to the readers' imaginations (this isn't exactly a storybook), although the final sentence hints at the bittersweet events of the ending. The prose is fairly standard, nothing special; quotes from the film are littered through it, some directly from the books.<br />The pictures are what make this book stand out, with phenomenal shots of Minas Tirith, Pippin in his silver and black Gondorian armor, a helmeted Gondorian guard, an angelic shot of Eowyn, two Elven smiths reforging Aragorn's sword, and Frodo fending off Shelob with the phial Galadriel gave him. What's more, there are scenes that never made it to the final film, such as Aragorn tending the wounded Faramir in the Houses of Healing, or Frodo and Sam looking at a broken statue crowned with flowers. (Somewhat disappointing are the lack of pictures of the monstrous spider Shelob, or the ghostly army of the dead)<br />While it won't satisfy those longing to know the grand finale, &quot;The Return of the King Photo Guide&quot; will be eagerly devoured by fans of the films, with its wonderful pictures and semi-storybook outline. Definitely should be purchased for the photographs, and newbie fans may find it helpful too.	2004-01-19

So it's not exactly surprising that the quirky whodunnit &quot;Last Leg&quot; has a lot of humor. Stolen body parts, sex-obsessed males (human and not), headless chickens and industrial waste somehow weave together in this book.<br />Marl Trevicker wakes to a monstrous hangover, an absent wife (she's having breast enlargement surgery), a dirty house, a comatose (hungover) brother on his couch, and his libidinous cat having an intimate encounter with his neck. What's more, his leg is missing. No, not a real leg -- due to a freak accident that rearranged his life, he has a prosthetic leg. And it's gone. And somebody is breaking into his home.<br />Well, clearly that sort of thing can't be allowed to continue -- and he wants his leg back. He enlists the aid of Cranci, a sexy private detective who aids in his problems. (Yes, he has the hots for her) That is, until his cat is kidnapped... er, catnapped, and he's swept up into a bizarre conspiracy of breaking-and-entering, toxic waste, the occasional interrupted assault, and the missing body part...<br />Gritty, raunchy, weird and quite funny, &quot;Last Leg&quot; has the flavor of Carl Hiaasen (PG-14-rated humor and odd urban characters) he collaborated with Raymond Chandler (lots of amusing one-liners). The peculiar crimes in Marl's life mixed with more realistic problems (industrial waste being dumped in a river) are somehow meshed together, although readers might be a little confused by the connections.<br />Hanson flips smoothly from passages that almost seem like a script, to evocative descriptions complete with sounds, smells, textures, and other little details that make them come alive. As for Marl's thoughts, this seems like a pretty accurate glimpse (well, as far as I can tell) inside an average male head. A little stream-of-consciousness, some life musings and flashbacks, and lots of woman-related thoughts.<br />The world of &quot;Last Leg&quot; is peopled with very quirky characters, like Marl (who has the cushiest job in the world, and they can't fire him), a guy with tattooed hair, a lust-crazed cat, and many more. Marl has a sort of everyman appeal; he's not quite hapless, although at times he seems to think he is. Cranci is an enigma who hides some very surprising motives, and Cliff a little too woman-crazed at times (make that a LOT!), but a good sidekick and sounding board.<br />Fans of Dave Barry and Carl Hiaasen's novels will enjoy the comic whodunnit &quot;Last Leg.&quot; Entertaining, frenetic and very quirky.ashbacks, and lots of woman-related thoughts.<br />The world of &quot;Last Leg&quot; is peopled with very quirky characters, like Marl (who has the cushiest job in the world, and they can't fire him), a guy with tattooed hair, a lust-crazed cat, and many more.

Rock biographer Victor Bockris teamed with Debbie Harry and Chris Stein to produce this book, a quirky and enlightening view of Blondie's rise to fame. Good anecdotes, wonderful pictures, and an intimate look into what it was like.<br />Stein and Harry first give us a glimpse of their early lives and childhoods, and then the events that propelled them to the music biz, including early band stuff (like the Stillettoes). They lived in cold apartments run by very strange people (sometimes smoking even weirder stuff), were saved by the cats, performed in the legendary CBGB's, and swirled around the music scene with the Ramones, Television, the Kinks, and now-extinct punk journalists. Then they hit the big time, jetting across the world and clinging to their rough edges.<br />Harry and Stein have not a single bad thing to say about their musical peers, only pleasant camaraderie. Harry's quirky wit is an easily-acquired taste; she's straightforward and dryly humorous. The parts that are more clearly Stein are a little less vivid to read. At times it's easy to get lost in the prose and forget which is which, however. What's more, the stories are less focused on the perks of fame than on the day-to-day life in a band.<br />The only problem is that at times, it's necessary to skip back to figure out who the heck so-and-so is, and what connection he had to Stein and Harry. However, Bockris does an excellent job of slipping in articles and written anecdotes by Harry. While the result gets a little bumpy at times, it's overall a smooth ride through the years.<br />The pictures are a mix of stylized publicity shots (like the pouty &quot;Punkmate&quot; picture) and candids. The candids are wonderful, ranging from Harry wielding a hammer in Japan to a window riddled with bullet holes to makeup for a Giger-inspired music video (truly eerie). The pictures seem spontaneous and natural, and the grubbiness of some of them gives a better idea of what it was like to live there. (Not to mention posing with the Ramones, Nancy Spungeon, Bill Murray, Joan Jett and others)<br />&quot;Making Tracks: The Rise of Blondie&quot; is not merely for Blondie fans, but for fans of now-classic rock and good music.

Set in a small Japanese fishing village in the mid-20th century, this is a beautiful story that will charm the romantic at heart with its simplicity and intensity.<br />Shinji is a poor young fisherman, living with his widowed mother and relatively carefree. That changes when he sees a lovely young pearl-diver named Hatsue looking out to sea. Shinji soon finds that he can't get Hatsue out of his mind; he's fallen in love, for the very first time. She soon falls in love with him as well -- it's first love for them both, and for a few days everything seems fine.<br />But things start to go wrong when an unhappy young girl sees the two of them leaving a secluded spot. Soon rumors are spread about Hatsue and Shinji's relationship, and the arrogant Yasuo even physically chases Hatsue when she is getting water. When Hatsue's overprotective father forbids her to see Shinji again, and seems about to betroth her to Yasuo, Shinji has only one chance to be reunited with his love.<br />Generally the word &quot;romance&quot; conjures images of busty half-naked women being held in impossible positions by chiseled he-men with torn shirts. But &quot;Sound of Waves&quot; is genuine romance, about the sort of love that any person could experience if they are open to it, in any part of the world. He is also one of the few authors who can convey the joy and pain of being in love. Not to mention the exalted way one can feel, without losing sight of their humanity: Shinji and Hatsue definitely have hormones, but keep them in check. There's a kind of mature innocence to how these two interact.<br />Yukio Mishima's writing is both brief and detailed. Simple and descriptive, evoking the wind, sea, trees, and shorelines. The story is a simple one (boy meets girl, girl and boy fall in love, boy and girl are separated, etc), but its simplicity is part of its appeal. There are even some things about pearl-diving and fishing included, to give a glimpse of the lives that Hatsue, Shinji and their families live.<br />The best thing abou this brief novel is the lead characters. Shinji is a shy, inexperienced, capable teenage boy, not a confident stud. Hatsue captures his attention not through mere physical beauty (though she sounds quite pretty), but through her sweetness. The wannabe-playboy, and the &quot;ugly&quot; girl who wistfully falls for Shinji, are like real people.<br />This is romance as it should be written, beautiful and tender with lovable characters and haunting prose. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for in sweetness.

History-Making 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup!	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Scores a goal	How often does a sports fan get to meet his/her idols, let alone interview and photograph them? AND get to write a book about it? Soccer fans will flock to &quot;Soccer Dreams,&quot; Leah Lauber's account of her rise to a junior journalist for  the St. Petersburg Times, and how she covered the 1999 World Cup for women.<br />Lauber first began playing soccer at the age of seven (and still plays it to this day), and even went to the Summer Olympics. But her liking for soccer took a surprising turn when she joined the X-Team, a special band of kid journalists for the largest paper in Florida. Not only did she get to interview women's soccer stars, but was sent out to cover the 1999 Women's World Cup, an exciting and important sports event.<br />Lauber's style is simple but pleasant, without the meandering style or embellishments that many young writers have. Aside from her chronicling of what she did, she includes interviews, articles, and even the query letter she sent to X Press asking to be part of its X-Team. She also doesn't leap straight into the heavy beef of her story, but builds up gradually to it by introducing her longtime love of soccer and pre-journalism experiences watching the soccer team.<br />The photographs were (mostly) taken by Lauber and her family members, and they're pretty good. Mostly candids, flattering but fresh and un-self-conscious, such as a shot of a tired Mia Hamm, Michelle Akers with an icepack, and Lauber herself (especially when she received the call about winning the contest). An especially nice detail are the sequences of &quot;action&quot; photos on the field.<br />Nicely-written and full of excellent photographs, &quot;Soccer Dreams&quot; is a rousing and entertaining read, especially for aspiring writers and soccer fans. Excellent work.	2004-01-01

While fresh at the start, it goes too fast and too choppily.<br />Rose was an &quot;East&quot; baby (her mom believes that what direction a baby is born facing will determine its personality). Or so she thought. Actually, she was born facing North, but her superstitious mother brainwashes everyone into believing that she's an East baby. Her family is poor and rapidly decaying, since her sister is very ill and they're about to be evicted from their farmhouse.<br />Then a white bear appears at their door and informs them (very painfully) that if Rose comes with him, the sister will be cured and the family will be well-off. Rose comes with him, to a palatial lodge full of everything she could need, including a strange servant, and something that sleeps near her every night. But a trip home ends in disaster, when she accidently discovers a curse on the bear -- and learns of a troll princess's magical plot.<br />There isn't much that's new in &quot;East,&quot; except for minor details like the wind roses (whatever those are), &quot;birth direction&quot; superstitions, the dresses that Rose weaves, or the presence of Neddy. Overall it begins and ends more or less as you'd expect. It's prettily written in many places, with plenty of descriptions of nature and the outdoors.<br />The multiple points-of-view are what make and break this book. On one hand, it's interesting to see the same events from the points-of-view of Rose, her father, her brother Neddy, and the bear (the troll princess's thoughts serve mainly as backstory). On the other hand, most of the humans sound alike, and the transitions from one chapter to another are painfully choppy. It also goes by too fast. The book starts at a leisurely pace, then suddenly speeds up (the months Rose spends in the bear's castle seem more like a few days).<br />Rose is a good enough heroine, although she doesn't seem as freaked-out as you'd expect. Her father is wonderful, a man who is haunted by a vague sense of guilt that he has lied to his daughter. And considering that most of the bear's thoughts are rendered in very short sentences, they're very evocative. What's even better, the bear (unlike in many stories) had already encountered Rose before asking her to come with him.<br />Fans of fairy-tale retellings will eat up &quot;East,&quot; but many readers might be put off by the abrupt pacing.

He doesn't know much about it, but he knows that Simon Lovelace, the man who has it, has had someone killed to get it. He also has a personal motive -- Lovelace hurt and humiliated him, and his obnoxious, cowardly master didn't help him. Ever since, Simon has been plotting to get back at Lovelace.<br />Bartimaeus is peeved, but has to obey Nathaniel. It immediately becomes clear that the amulet is a lot more important than it looks -- and someone will kill to keep it a secret. Lovelace tracks the amulet to Nathaniel's house and attacks them, while Bartimaeus is captured and confined in the Tower of London. Despite their initial dislike, they must join forces, or Lovelace will use the amulet for an unspeakable crime.<br />An alternative universe with magicians as the ruling class is hardly a new idea. But Jonathan Stroud manages to make it fresher than before with a complicated British government ruled by magicians. Not to mention a rebel band of &quot;commoners&quot; (meaning: non-magic-users) who are sick of being treated like cattle. (That's something you won't see in &quot;Harry Potter&quot;)<br />Stroud is also a writer who can handle just about any words he tries. He switches freely between first person (Bartimaeus) and third person (Nathaniel) narratives. The writing is pretty detailed; not too much, just enough to make it all come alive. What's more, the constant tussling between Nathaniel and Bartimaeus adds a note of much-needed character tension.<br />The biggest problem with &quot;The Amulet of Samarkand&quot; is that Nathaniel (who spends much of the book being rather demanding and snobby) took a VERY long time to grow on me, and even as he does good things, you get the feeling he's not a really good person. Bartimaeus is, however, an amazing character -- witty, sardonic, irreverent and wry, looking on with annoyed amusement at the rest of the scrambling cast, including his fellow djinn and demons.<br />&quot;The Amulet of Samarkand&quot; is a solid, genuinely suspenseful fantasy with a sparkling title character and a rather annoying supporting lead. Well-written, interesting, this is one of the really good fantasy books of the past year.t problem with &quot;The Amulet of Samarkand&quot; is that Nathaniel (who spends much of the book being rather demanding and snobby) took a VERY long time to grow on me, and even as he does good things, you get the feeling he's not a really good person.

And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a darn good read.<br />We open some sixty years after the events of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is &quot;Mad Baggins&quot;). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.<br />Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.<br />Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the &quot;feel&quot; of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.<br />Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as &quot;The Hobbit&quot;: it's lighter and more cheerful. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.<br />One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.<br />Frodo himself is the quintessential &quot;little guy&quot; hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say &quot;everyhobbit.&quot;<br />We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of &quot;Hobbit&quot; -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit to a bolder, more decisive person. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.<br />Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today.

Centuries later, young Prince Tristan is about to become king of Eutracia, where those of &quot;endowed&quot; blood get to rule. Except he doesn't want to. When he gets lost in the woods and ends up in a cave full of red water, his sister Princess Shailiha and the wizard Wigg search for him -- and encounter signs of the sorceresses' return.<br />Tristan's coronation is interrupted by horrible flying creatures that murder all the wizards but Wigg, his parents, and most of the people in the area. Then the sorceresses kidnap Shailiha -- and her unborn baby -- with the help of a mysterious fifth sorceress (the title character has virtually no impact on the story). Now Tristan and Wigg must rescue Shailiha before the sorceresses get their hands on unspeakable magical power.<br />Few books can truly be said to have no redeeming characteristics, but &quot;Fifth Sorceress&quot; is among those. It's a stinking, sloppy, poorly-written and poorly-characterized mess. There are only so many ways that things can be handled originally in fantasy. With wise and cryptic wizards, magic trinkets, winged warriors and a chiseled hero, how original can the book be? Even the concept of &quot;pure blood&quot; was painful.<br />The writing is poorly edited and inconsistent. At one point, Tristan is raped by one of the sorceresses. Weirdly enough, he doesn't seem traumatized at all by this. Killing his own dad has only slightly more effect. Newcomb's style is unsubtle and repetitive; the words &quot;blood,&quot; &quot;endowed,&quot; and &quot;Chosen&quot; show up constantly. His obsession with sex shows in his weird choice of words (how can a person have a &quot;sexual longing&quot; for WATER?), and  his &quot;shocking stuff&quot; (heads being strung on rope like beads) either read like bad porn or an unnecessary effort to shock.<br />Perhaps the most offensive aspect of the book is the way women are portrayed. Either they're evil, perverted dominatrix fiends who wear sexy clothes (gotta have some gratuitous leg-flashing), or they are subserviant idiots who either get pregnant and cry, or serve as convenient sex toys for the protagonist. Apparently Tristan's endowed twin Shailiha (Princess Leia, anyone?) is supposed to be a spunky female character. The less said about Shailiha, the better.<br />Tristan is a whiny, spineless excuse for a hero. While reluctance can be a good trait in a hero, here it just makes him seem like a spoiled brat who doesn't want to deal with responsibility. Wigg is a cookie-cutter wizard. Shailiha is so much baggage; she's basically a walking womb for an &quot;endowed&quot; baby the sorceresses want. She goes insane fairly soon into the book (apparently a woman can't retain her sanity if her husband is killed), and is even more annoying when she's insane.<br />&quot;Fifth Sorceress&quot; comes across as &quot;Star Wars&quot; reimagined by an S&amp;M enthusiast. A putrid, poorly-written, excruciating excuse for hack fantasy. It takes the worst of the genre and cobbles it together in one reeking bundle.

Nobody takes him seriously; his nickname is &quot;flunk-out.&quot; He's about to storm out, claiming that nobody could study in Maison Ikkoku, when the beautiful Kyoko walks in the door, announcing that she's the new manager. Yusaku immediately is smitten with her.<br />Unfortunately their relationship gets off to a rough start, though Kyoko is kind and supportive of him. First his neighbor claims he's peeking into her room. Then Yusaku accidently gets into a few compromising situations with Kyoko -- and suspects that she has a boyfriend named Soichiro (which is also her dog's name). When the landlord comes to visit, Yusaku finds out who Kyoko's mystery man is, and why she still thinks about him.<br />Takahashi's artwork is a little rougher and smudgier here than in her later series, but closer to how people actually look. And, in keeping with that, they act very much like real people. Some of the supporting characters, in the first volume, border on caricature, but the primary people are 3-D. And while there's plenty of humor, Takahashi tugs at the heartstrings in all the right places (such as Yusaku wondering how he can ace his test without Kyoko encouraging him, or Kyoko thinking that Yusaku didn't mean it when he said he loved her).<br />Without Chinese curses or rampaging demons to deal with, the inhabitants of Maison Ikkoku can themselves be formidable problems. Misunderstandings, teen crushes, drunken proclaimations of love in the streets, domineering relatives and lost &quot;perfect&quot; spouses make it a lot harder to fall in love. You know what's got to happen, but somehow the Real World always intrudes.<br />Yusaku is a lovable naif. The poor guy wants desperately to tell Kyoko how he feels, but there's always something in his way -- especially his own financial shortcomings. Kyoko is a fantastic portrait of a woman who, while determined to stay faithful to her dead husband, is starting to appreciate her hapless tenant.<br />Those who enjoy a funny, sad, almost-squeaky-clean almost-romance (like most of Takahashi's other works) will definitely like &quot;Maison Ikkoku.&quot; Move in and join the ruckus.n love.

And with &quot;Fellowship&quot; and &quot;Two Towers,&quot; Jude Fisher offers a window into what the movie's going to contain.<br />In it, she outlines what happens to the increasingly splintered band of heroes as the battle for Middle-Earth revs up. She not only talks about what they do, but how they've changed over time (such as Sam's growing inner strength, or Frodo's deterioration). And it has some fantastic pictures to boot.<br />The photos for this book are nothing short of phenomenal, especially for fans of Minas Tirith; plenty of pictures from all angles, the White Tower, Denethor's hall, archers on the walls, and a close-up of a guard near the Tree. There are also shots of Fell Beasts, Osgiliath, the Paths of the Dead (very creepy), Gandalf looking out at Mount Doom, and Frodo and Sam struggling up the slopes of said volcano; the one disappointment is the lack of Shelob pictures. The final shot of Frodo staring at the Ring is hauntingly ambiguous.<br />Jude Fisher includes a recap of the previous two movies, just in case any details are forgotten. And her descriptions of movie action have gotten a bit more flowery, as if she's really gotten swept away by the story; thankfully, this doesn't really obscure what's going on, even if does get a bit distracting. There are more spoilers (especially the death of one character, and the secret identity of another) but the climactic events are kept mysterious.<br />Longtime fans and newbies alike will find &quot;The Return of The King Visual Companion&quot; a good source before heading into the film. Today, we fight! Tomorrow, we go to the movies!	2003-12-07

Rumiko Takahashi manages to take what sounds like a typical second-rate fantasy story, and transforms it into something funny, romantic, sinister, and very hard to classify.<br />This boxed set includes the first two volumes of the manga and the first three episodes of the anime. In the manga, schoolgirl Kagome is dragged by a monster into an old dry well on the family shrine's grounds. She emerges in medieval Japan. As if that wasn't weird enough, she learns that she is the reincarnation of a venerated priestess who died clutching the Sacred Shikon Jewel fifty years before.<br />And when the jewel turns up (from inside Kagome's body)  and is shattered, she has to join forces with the hostile young half-demon Inu-Yasha -- who was sealed with a spell by Kagome's pre-incarnation. They don't like one another (they bicker constantly, even though the first signs of attraction are blooming) but they have to work together. Not just to collect the jewel shards, but to defeat deadly demons like Yura of the Hair, and Inu-Yasha's ruthless half-brother Sesshomaru.<br />In addition, this set includes the first volume of the anime TV series, currently running on the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. It basically includes the events of the first manga volume, up until midway through the Yura storyline. There's slightly less gore, and the dialogue is slightly different (for example, Kagome calls Inuyasha \\"peeping tom!\\" instead of \\"animal!\\"), but overall it's very faithful to the manga's content.<br />This is a good introduction to the Inu-Yasha series, and will probably leave a lasting impression on those new to either the manga or the anime. A worthwhile buy.	2003-12-06

Food, food, food, and more food; the lead character lives and breathes foods. Robin McKinley is an able writer, and it's intriguing to see her shift from monsters and spirits to vampires. But unfortunately the execution leaves something to be desired.<br />Rae Sneddon (known to everyone as &quot;Sunshine&quot;), who makes cinnamon rolls at her stepfather's bakery, is kidnapped by a gang of vampires one night when she goes out to an old lakeside cabin. She's stuffed into an evening gown and chained in a decrepit ballroom, near a hungry vampire who is also trapped there. But he doesn't eat her. Instead, Con sticks it out, asking her to tell him stories and anecdotes, and she tries to oblige.<br />Sunshine draw on her own magic to help herself and Con escape during the day. After he vanishes, she tries to go back to her old life. But a mysterious wound, suspicious SOF officers, and the revelation of impending global doom (because of vampires) draws her back to Con, when both of them are threatened by the vampire who chained them together in the first place...<br />McKinley shifts her territory here. Instead of more generic medieval fantasy, she goes in for contemporary vampire/fantasy; she has the skill to make any scene at night absolutely bloodcurdling. The problem is, between the spellbinding stretches of intriguing, dark, sensuous material, there are much longer stretches of baking, whining, historical infodumping, un-erotic semi-sexual interludes with Con and Mel, and thinking about the personal quirks of customers.<br />The backdrop is intriguing, if underused; the rather poorly-defined world of vampires, werewolves, demons, and other &quot;Others&quot; is given a fresh twist, and the possibility of them taking over human civilization is genuinely chilling. Rae's blossoming magic (fuelled by sunlight) is an unusual twist, and one that I wish had been explored further.<br />Rae isn't a particularly engaging heroine; she seems more like a dissatisfied middle-aged woman than a young, inexperienced one. There really isn't anything likable about her. Con is intriguing, an enigmatic walking corpse, but McKinley doesn't let us in his head. Many of the promising characters (like Rae's mom or her biker boyfriend Mel) aren't explored in full; they're both extremely interesting, but left on the backburner in favor of even more baked goods.<br />&quot;Sunshine&quot; is an interesting read, but not a very fulfilling one. Enough loose threads are left dangling for a sequel, but hopefully one that's tighter and sharper than this one.n't a particularly engaging heroine; she seems more like a dissatisfied middle-aged woman than a young, inexperienced one.

But Moser and Crawford focus mainly on the dumbest of the dumb, the most bizarre antics of any celebs out there. It's a dopey bathroom book, but at least it delivers the goods.<br />In this book, the various &quot;dumbest things&quot; of various rock stars and groups are included, ranging from the &quot;aging rock geezers&quot; like Mick Jagger (who disappointed a pair of very imaginative groupies), the weird but lovable Ozzy Osbourne before his hit TV show (he is sick of being asked about the bat thing) and Aerosmith (Steven Tyler used to shoot nuns' livestock). There are guys who never were old enough to be aging rock geezers like Jim Morrison (who got attacked by a furious old lady who thought he had yelled &quot;look at those t*ts&quot; at her) and Keith Moon (who once danced naked on the Jaggers' table). There are the weirdos of yesterday who are still around (like Michael Jackson -- nuff zed). There are three out of the four Beatles. And there are bands and singers of today, such as Courtney Love (who punched her husband on first acquaintance), Oasis (they like to hit each other too), and Bjork (once destroyed a nightclub).<br />For each band or singer, there's not merely a listing of their idiotic stunts. Oh no. Their listings of greatest hits and/or movie roles are included, as well as stupid quotes (&quot;If God wants me to become a woman, then a woman I will become&quot; -- very deep, Mick; &quot;I like Beethoven, especially the poems&quot;). The tone is wry and witty.<br />There are some problems with this book. For one thing, some of the material is definitely of the urban legend variety. For another, they have a few weird choices, where you wonder why certain groups were excluded. And did Linda McCartney really do more dumb things than her famed hubby? I don't think so. And really, I'd classify the Spice Girls (anyone remember them?) as being pop rather than rock, although George Harrison's witty remark about them is immensely funny. (And their dumb quotes are even funnier. &quot;Who's Hillary?&quot;).<br />Though far from perfect, &quot;Rock Stars Do the Dumbest Things&quot; will make you glad to be... well, not a rock star.

With amazing pictures but incomplete text, this is a pretty good but unsatisfying coffee table book.<br />It charts the Rolling Stones from their respective childhoods, to becoming the baddest rock band in England. Then it follows them into parenthood, marriage, addiction, rehab, the death of messed-up bandmate Brian Jones and the near-breakup of the band in the 1980s. Music, mayhem, and the occasional arrest make up this book.<br />The pictures virtually MAKE this book. Many of them are ones I hadn't seen before, and there are actually more candids than posed pics. Pics of Mick Jagger being punched in the street, Keith Richards playing with his son on a tire swing, and the Stones examining possible cover photos are among these. The pictures have an intimate quality, and many of them get across the camaraderie or alienation between the Stones.<br />One of the major problems with the book is the lack of insights into the dynamics behind the music. Wives, girlfriends, children, fellow musician friends and so on are barely mentioned, occasionally pictured (Marianne Faithfull is barely visible behind her huge hat). It feels incomplete to have no view of what these guys are like to anyone except one another.<br />If they had included interviews from more than just the Stones themselves, it would feel more rounded, like the Aerosmith autobiography &quot;Walk This Way,&quot; which included interviews from just about everybody associated with the band. And about half of the essays don't add to the book's content at all, especially the ones that analyze the Stones from a distance instead of talking about the writer's personal experience.<br />&quot;According to the Rolling Stones&quot; will delight fans of the Stones, especially those who like to see backstage pictures and hear how this song or that song came to be.

Silmarillion was the Bible. And the Histories of Middle-Earth series is the big stack of history books. Author J.R.R. Tolkien wrote a vast fictional history of Middle-Earth, and the first five volumes of the Histories are compiled here.<br />The evolving backdrop of stories about Elves, Men, and the rich tapestry of fictional history is shown here, such as earlier versions of the legendary romance of Beren and Luthien, or the history of the Valar. Not the finished product of &quot;Silmarillion,&quot; but older drafts riddled with footnotes and commentary from Tolkien's son Christopher. What's more, it includes linguistic evolution, exquisite poetry, and a time travel story that evolved into something much greater.<br />It takes a certain amount of geeky dedication to read these books. They are not light reading, and it takes knowledge of the final material to understand their significance. In many of the stories, there is greater detail than is found in the Silmarillion. And in many cases, there are huge differences, such as the mortal Beren originally being an Elf. (Which changes the whole story of Beren and Luthien, and also how we see their distant descendants, Aragorn and Arwen)<br />Fans of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Silmarillion&quot; will undoubtedly enjoy seeing how the unrivalled fantasy stories came to be.

And if this is so for &quot;House of Leaves, then Mark Danielewski is a swirling mixture of the mad and the magnificent. This book is unlike any other that I have ever read -- hard and surreal, strange and magnificent.<br />Will Navidson moves into a house with a secret, a door that leads into a bizarre tangle of stairways and passages. After his experiences are put down in the Navidson Record, a blind man named Zampan&ograve; makes further studies of the house -- and then the tattoo artist Johnny Truant, after Zampan&ograve;'s death.As the reader goes deeper into the house (the word &quot;house&quot; isusually printed in blue), reality and perception start to warp...<br />Trying to explain &quot;House of Leaves&quot; is like trying to explain &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; in one sentence. Summarizing is hard enough; summarizing it briefly is virtually impossible. But if the actual story of &quot;House of Leaves&quot; is fantastic, then the way it's written is even better.It's sprinkled with anecdotes, letters (often with crossed-out lines), footnotes, lists, appendices, and pseudo-interview snippets from people like Anne Rice, Camille Paglia, David Copperfield, Stephen King, and Stanley Kubrick. There are pages that are entirely blotted out, or have only a single word, or are printed upside-down, sideways, tilted, running into a mess of letters, or in a spiral. There is poetry, pictures of tattered pages, musical notes, collages and paintings.<br />Danielewski's style is amazing. It's in flux -- some parts of it, in keeping with who wrote it, are dry and flat (Zampan&ograve;), and some are more casual (Truant). But as the book grows darker and more surreal, it doesn't alienate -- instead, it draws you in and warps how you see the world for just a little while, as if the book is reaching out of its pages to grab the reader's brain. Almost like the house, one might say.<br />The kind of terror and horror in &quot;House of Leaves&quot; are not the kind you read in hack horror books, where something transforms or a nasty thing leaps out of the shadows and eviscerates screaming extras. It's a creeping, subtle thing, like oil dripping over the surface of a pond. It's like a hallucination, surreal and continually shifting, where the laws of physics don't apply.<br />This genre-busting post-modernist book is like taking a rollercoaster through a Dali-designed funhouse.

And with a title like &quot;Boogers Are My Beat: More Lies, But Some Actual Journalism,&quot; you know it's gotta be worth looking at. While it's not Barry's strongest collection (it feels a little fragmented), it's still the sort of stuff to split your sides.<br />In this book, Dave starts off with some older columns from the presidential election that will live in infamy (if the mention of dimpled chads make you twitch, these chapters will make you have a seizure). Then he proceeds to spoof, lampoon and chuckle over such things as belligerent turkeys, the Oscars, the perils of fatherhood (and having a birthday party for a two-year-old), determining what the Lone Ranger was saying to his horse (even consulting Stephen King on that), an RV in a Wal-Mart parking lot, moving to a new house (his windows have some sort of window leprosy), using the GOOD TOWELS, being subjected to post-terrorism airport security, and having a sewage station in North Dakota named after him. He finishes up with two nonhumorous columns about September 11th.<br />The &quot;actual journalism&quot; is mostly confined to A) making fun of the Republican and Democratic conventions, and B) covering a swingers' convention. Yes! They do have conventions! Not at the same place as the Dem and Rep cons, though. Sprinkled through it is the same gleeful bathroom humor, gender jokes, anagrams, and weird names for rock bands that he is famous for.The only exception is the final two columns, sensitive, serious, and more or less pinpointing what the average person feels. (These are put at the end, so they won't ruin down the burp-humor before it) One of the big changes is that for &quot;hapless humor,&quot; he now focuses on his baby daughter rather than his dogs.<br />The only problem with this collection of columns is that it feels kind of patched together -- first we have election humor from a few years back, then ordinary humor on a variety of topics, then serious stuff. It's more than a little jarring, and makes the book seem shorter than it is. I was a little surprised to see at the end that it was as long (or even longer) than his other works.<br />&quot;Boogers Are My Beat&quot; is a great new serving of Barry humor, even if it has three different flavors and one of them isn't funny.

Since that series has a flat planet on the back of a turtle, it stands to reason that Pratchett can make almost any unlikely plot work. In this case, he mixes scifi and fantasy with a healthy dose of satire in the Bromeliad Trilogy.<br />In &quot;Truckers,&quot; a small band of tiny nomes, led by the desperate Masklin, have nearly been killed off by the rough life on city streets. But then they find themselves in the vast Store (also called Arnold Bros, est. 1905) where there are even more nomes -- nomes who think that Outside is a legend. But they're about to have a rude awakning -- in less than a month, the store will be demolished. And if the nomes don't get away quickly, they'll be wiped out too.<br />&quot;Diggers&quot; picks up the tale of the nomes after they escape the doomed Store. They take up resident in an abandoned quarry and start to make new lives there. But when the quarry is set to be reopened, a new, long-term plan must be made -- they must get the Thing (a little talking black box) back to the ship that brought them to Earth in the first place!<br />&quot;Wings&quot; is a parallel tale to &quot;Diggers,&quot; as Masklin struggles to get the Thing back to their ancient ship. To do that, the Thing says, it needs to go to Florida. Masklin and his friends haven't got the faintest idea where Florida is or how to get there. But to save their tiny race, Masklin will venture into the unknown -- a huge flying truck called a Concorde. But will they be successful in finding the ship?<br />A civilization of tiny people living in a department store sounds like the dorkier juvenile fantasy stories, but Terry Pratchett's unique spin makes it thoroughly entertaining. He sprinkles the books with Bible-like quotations (&quot;And Arnold Bros (est. 1905) said, Let there be Signs, so that all within shall know the proper running of the Store&quot;), and plenty of humor (&quot;You may be interested to know that we've just broken the sound barrier!&quot; &quot;All right, own up.

While &quot;Wings&quot; has somewhat less tension (because we KNOW what's going to happen), it's fun to see the highly improbable schemes of the nomes being put into action.

Especially an idealistic-to-a-fault one who has to deal with a... well, shall we say, interesting group of students. (That is to say, more than a little insane)<br />Miss Barrett arrives at Calvin Coolidge High, to teach English to a motley band of students. Among them are: Hormone-addled Linda; resentful, angry Joe Ferone; woman-hating Rusty (who repeatedly tells Barrett that he would like her if she weren't &quot;a female&quot;); Edward Williams Esq., who thinks that everything is racially-prejudiced; soppily romantic Alice, and a slew of others. Miss Barrett realizes over time that the kids are screaming out not just for education, but for love and understanding. But will her idealism break through to them?<br />This isn't really a novel as people generally think of it -- it's composed of skits, letters, notes, and occasionally stretches of dialogue between the teachers and students. Sounds awful? It isn't. Instead it's cute and quirky, and if you get past the odd format it will become immensely enjoyable and coherent. The dialogue is funny, especially since quite a few of the students don't spell-check. (&quot;Fuk&quot;?) There are also suggestion box excerpts (&quot;You think it's fair when a teacher takes off 5 points on a test just because I misspelled his name wrong?&quot;; &quot;We're behind you 85%!&quot;) and book reports (&quot;We study myths to learn what it was like to live in the golden age with all the killings&quot;; &quot;We read it because it's a classicle&quot;). One chapter is even devoted to the extremely imaginative lies that the students think up to explain what happened to their homework (&quot;Some one stole it&quot;) with a bit of honesty as well (&quot;I didn't know we were supposed to do it&quot;).<br />There are more serious moments, such as one young woman dying after a botched abortion, and a lovelorn girl jumping out of a window  because her crush read one of her love letters. And Barrett's disillusionment near the end is as saddening as the response of the students is uplifting. It's also rather pleasant to read that a teacher with genuinely good intentions and hopes can make a positive difference, even though it lacks in realism. The peculiar narrative drags a bit during the first fourth, but picks up after that with more about the students and less chitchat between teachers.<br />&quot;Up the Down Staircase&quot; is touching and funny, a novel in the barest sense but immensely enjoyable. It's a little weird and drags at times, but it's still fun. And if you're a teacher, you'll probably be weeping at the traumatic memories it brings back.a botched abortion, and a lovelorn girl jumping out of a window  because her crush read one of her love letters.

Like its predecessor, it succeeds where most teen books fail -- it's funny and entertaining.<br />Jessica is attending SPECIAL, a summer camp for the brilliant and talented, and rapidly learns that SPECIAL is as full of loons and freaks as her high school. She encounters Paul Parlipiano (\\"gay man of my dreams\\"), is given advice on her writing (she accidently turns in her diary as homework), considers going to Columbia, and writes to Hope. A lot.<br />Things get sticky when Jessica gets back. First, 9/11 threatens to throw a monkey wrench in her plans for Columbia. Marcus, the guy she almost slept with last year, is acting weird -- and she can't tell if he still likes her; her sister is pregnant; the girls encounter Hy again at a book-signing; the newly-gorgeous Len Levy becomes Jessica's boyfriend, until his lack of personality makes things hard; Jessica takes Ecstacy and regrets it in the morning; and worst of all, an anonymous person is sending out \\"Pineville Low\\" emails full of shock-gossip.<br />At first it seems like \\"Second Helpings\\" is slipping a bit. The first fifty or so pages seem less funny, a little more over the top, and less cohesive. But things snap together when Jessica gets back to her home turf, with her insane family and creepy classmates. If anything, the latter part of the book is tighter than \\"Sloppy Firsts\\" was, with many of Jessica's loose threads being tied up neatly but not improbably. (Her grandmother and Hy's book among them)<br />As in the first book, McCafferty knows how to make things wry, sardonic and delightfully overwrought through Jessica's eyes. But in the last chapters, she also shows an ability to write tender, loving, sweet stuff with a minimum of cynicism, and make it sweetly sexy without being vulgar. And the Pineville Low emails are a stroke of genius; McCafferty kept me guessing all through the book who the writer of those emails was.<br />Jessica has matured but not gotten any less confused or prone to embarrassments. Marcus, more than before, is a weirdly attractive enigma wrapped in a mystery. Bridget and Pepe serve as a nice support system for Jessica, while Sara, Scotty and Manda all continue as annoyances. Len Levy, a cameo in the first book, appears in all his distinct lack-of-glory.<br />Those tired of the more typical teen novels may enjoy \\"Second Helpings.\\" This may the second helping, but it sounds like Jessica has plenty left.lle Low emails are a stroke of genius; McCafferty kept me guessing all through the book who the writer of those emails was.<br />Jessica has matured but not gotten any less confused or prone to embarrassments.

Namely, his sculptures (such as the David statue) and his paintings (such as the Sistine Chapel's ceiling). But poetry? Not a lot of people know he did that too.<br />In &quot;The Poetry of Michaelangelo: An Annotated Translation,&quot; James M. Saslow offers a bilingual presentation of Michaelangelo's poetry, one Italian and one English. Sonnets, madrigals, and other poetic forms are used. And Michaelangelo's poetry is not the best technically -- some are kind of strained, and there are some grammatical errors. But they brim over with the kind of barely-restrained feeling that makes them come alive.<br />The poetry is heavily annotated, letting us know is the poem was written for someone (sometimes as an epitaph), influences, and the significance of the language used (since a lot of nuances could slip right by). But he doesn't just offer translations and footnotes. Saslow offers insights into Michaelangelo's musings on death, love and temptation, religion, and his own personal and artistic struggles.<br />Saslow does a solid job with the poetic translations, and explaining them to a modern audience. While Michaelangelo was a genius with stone and paint, he was pretty overwhelming with poetry as well.	2003-11-03

I think not	Robertson Davies' &quot;Salterton Trilogy&quot; is a well-written, often funny and sometimes poignant look at the realistically odd occupants of Salterton, the deceptively quaint Canadian city with two cathedrals and one university.<br />&quot;Tempest-Tost&quot; opens with the organization of an amateur production of Shakespeare's &quot;The Tempest.&quot; A motley crew of actors join it, including an exuberent professor, his quiet daughter, a quiet mama's boy, a beautiful rich girl, a womanizing soldier, and an infatuated schoolteacher. Love, ambition, jealousy and infatuation rapidly tangle together, climaxing in an unusually dramatic opening night.<br />&quot;Leaven of Malice&quot; is half satire and half mystery. The Salterton Bellman announces that Solly Bridgetower and Pearl Vambrace are engaged -- the only problem is that it isn't true. Professor Vambrace sees it as a personal affront, and sues the paper. Pearl and Solly are haunted by false rumors, reports, and claims about who faked the announcement. All they can do is try to find out themselves.<br />&quot;Mixture of Frailties&quot; opens with the death of Solly's domineering mother. Her will leaves money to Solly's family only if he produces a male heir with his wife Veronica (previously known as Pearl); until then, her money is to be used in a trust for a young female artistic hopeful, who will go to Europe for a few years to study whatever she is good at. And finding the right girl is only the start of Solly's problems.<br />The tone of the Salterton Trilogy is lighter and less introspective than Davies' other books. Sometimes it's outright hilarious (there's a girl called The Torso, for crying out loud!). The first book is perhaps the funniest and most real-seeming, but it's also rather unfocused because there is no plot. The second and third books are tighter, but a little more rarified in humor and a little more surreal in tone.<br />Solly Bridgetower is the unacknowledged center of the trilogy. He barely registers in &quot;Tempest-Tost,&quot; but becomes the central figure of the second and third books. He's not a strong person, but he is a likable one. Pearl is only a little more prominent at first, but it's great to see her break out of her shell and become her own person. And without a doubt, Humphrey Cobbler is Davies' best character -- a vivid, devil-may-care artistic genius who winks and nudges in every book.<br />The Salterton Trilogy is often eclipsed by Davies' better-known Deptford Trilogy, but that doesn't mean it's bad. By no means. It's a pleasant and warmly amusing trio of interconnected stories, and ones you won't forget in a hurry. Highly recommended.arely registers in &quot;Tempest-Tost,&quot; but becomes the central figure of the second and third books. He's not a strong person, but he is a likable one.

Lian Hearn, in &quot;Across The Nightingale Floor,&quot; is clearly brimming over with wonderful ideas, but the characters are pretty cold and the dramatic tension is nil.<br />In the Three Countries, a young boy named Tomasu discovers that his family has been cruelly slaughtered by Lord Iida; he's only saved by the semi-mysterious Lord of the Otori, Shigeru. Given the name of Takeo, he becomes Otori's ward, and learns that he is a member of the Tribe, a people with mysterious powers and abilities. As he learns his new skills, he learns more of his past.<br />But Shigeru has problems of his own when he's betrothed to Kaede, a beautiful young girl who is said to bring death to any guy who falls for her. To make things worse, Shigeru is in love with Lady Maruyama, a powerful relative of Kaede's. At the center of the betrothal is more political plotting and devious scheming, that will put Takeo to the test as he tries to kill Iida, who sleeps every night in the Nightingale Floor...<br />Japanese history and folklore are a much-underused fantasy source, compared to Anglo or Celtic fantasy, which is used in every other fantasy novel you come across. Hearn has definitely done his research, and he seamlessly integrates fantasy elements into a medieval Japanese setting. Concepts such as the Tribe, the complicated political strife and the Nightingale Floor (a floor that squeaks loudly at the slightest touch) are fantastic.<br />What's wrong with the book? The writing. While Hearn has the basic descriptions down, nothing comes alive. Tense, dramatic, action-filled scenes are flat and rather slow; one scene has Takeo creeping along to some dying condemned men, but there's no sense of urgency. The sudden passion Kaede and Takeo have is laughable. And when two major characters die tragic deaths, I felt completely unmoved. The good guys are utterly noble in all things, while the bad guys are evil through 'n' through.<br />Takeo in particular seems passionless and kinda dull. He goes through all sorts of harrowing experiences, but doesn't seem to feel anything. Shigeru was so noble and distant that I found it hard to care much about him. Kaede alone, with her growing sense of desperation, was a compelling character.<br />While the idea itself is twisty and intriguing to watch unfold, the execution is definitely lacking. Those hoping for a sort of Japanese &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; won't find the richness they were looking for.through.<br />Takeo in particular seems passionless and kinda dull.

Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Ring&quot; trilogy wholeheartedly embraced the film adaptation when it premiered almost three years ago. Now Weta Workshops (who did all the special effects, prosthetics, armor and makeup for the films) have produced a gorgeous bookend set along with the hardcover book.<br />Chosen by a special poll, the special hardcover edition is pretty nice to look at, but let's face it, the bookends are the best part. They're handpainted and very detailed, capturing the moment when Gandalf waits to be let in, only to be rebuffed by &quot;We don't want any more visitors, well-wishers, or distant relations!&quot;<br />One bookend has Bilbo moving to the door, and the other has Gandalf knocking with his staff on Bilbo's round green door. Fans of the movie will be pleased to know that they really do look like Ian Holm and Ian McKellen. Collectors of Tolkien merchandise will be delighted to put &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; &quot;Silmarillion,&quot; and other Middle-Earth books beside the trilogy, between these bookends.	2003-10-30

Was McKiernan's first-written book, &quot;Trek to Kraggen-Cor,&quot; better than the ones published before it? In a word, no. It's still a poor clone of J.R.R. Tolkien's masterful works.<br />Perry is the descendent of the great Tuckerby Underbank, living in the Boskydells. As a rather nerdy scholar, he dreams of battles and adventures -- and his fantasies come true when Lord Kian and two Dwarves show up on his doorstep. They need help reclaiming the ancient Dwarf citadel of Kraggen-Cor from the evil Spawn that have invaded, and Perry has memorized the old maps and directions.<br />Perry's thrilled, but his handyman Cotton Buckleburr isn't that thrilled. They travel with Kian and the Dwarves, training and learning to fight as they go, and soon meet up with their allies, the Dwarf army and the Vanadurim. But Perry is about to find out that what's ahead is not a glorious battle, but a horrific slaughter...<br />&quot;Trek to Kraggen-Cor&quot; is the sort of writing generally classified as &quot;fanfic&quot;: stories written by fans of a TV show, movie, or book. McKiernan is clearly a huge fan of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;; how else could he have taken so many details from Tolkien's masterful epic and transplanted them into a similar backdrop? Look at the Dwarves, the &quot;Watcher&quot; kraken, the death Ghath, every single thing about Warrows, the evil villains, the Elves, the Vanadurim. The whole thing stinks of Middle-Earth. Even small details -- such as the little silver horn or the mushrooms -- were written by Tolkien first and best.<br />Very little actually happens in this book; most of it is talking, travelling, or both at once. The travelling is excruciating; McKiernan gives us every dull detail. The dialogue is a little better, but there's too much melodrama (and, in Cotton's case, poorly-written country-Brit dialect). The preoccupation with clothing details, hysterical laughter, and to-be-continued sign on the end make it even more frustrating.<br />Perry is apparently supposed to be a naive yet plucky hero; he merely comes across as a drip who has no contact with reality. Cotton's folksy attitude wears thin, but he's an acceptable character; Kian really isn't very interesting. The Dwarves are all utterly interchangeable, including Borin and Anval.<br />The first is not always best, and such is true with &quot;Trek To Kraggen-Cor.&quot; Only if you liked his excruciating &quot;Iron Tower&quot; trilogy will you like the travesty of Dennis McKiernan's first duology.ry-Brit dialect).

Mysterious shootings. A cultured Fat Man, a conflicted PI, and a mystery object everyone wants. Hardboiled detective fiction was exemplified in &quot;The Maltese Falcon,&quot; and now it's the standard.<br />&quot;Shoo her in, darling.&quot; A beautiful red-haired woman comes into Miles &amp; Archer's detective agency. She claims to be looking for her sister, who has supposedly gone off with a guy called Thursby, and pays the two private eyes too much money. Later on, Miles is shot -- and no one knows who did it. Since Spade has been dallying with Miles' wife, he's a prime suspect.<br />Things go from bad to worse when Spade is kicked around by little weaselly Joel Cairo and the mysterious Fat Man. They, like the red-headed Brigid O'Shaugnessy, are searching for the priceless Maltese Falcon, a jeweled bird statue covered in black enamel. Who has the Falcon? Who stole it? Who killed for it? And who might kill again to get it back?<br />Everybody's seen the movie adaptation, starring Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade. So it's a little hard to not see him as Spade, however different Bogart looked. The same atmosphere is here, but it's much more sinister than the movie, or even of Hammett's other detective novels.<br />The writing is fantastic. Hammett's style is sharp and lean, without a lot of description where it isn't needed. Instead of giving us a feature-by-feature description of Spade, he just says that Spade looks like a &quot;blond Satan.&quot; Interpret that as you will. The dialogue is sharp and often a lot more realistic than you'd expect. What's astonishing is that Hammett shows us the characters just through their actions. Not a single thought is revealed.<br />Antiheroes are hard to write, but Hammett did it best. Morality is a palette of grays here; nobody is really good. If they're not outright despicable, then they have hidden creepy depths. Brigid O'Shaugnessy's little-girl act hides a nasty interior; Sam Spade, the &quot;blond Satan,&quot; is as tainted a person as some of his enemies. Perhaps the only truly likable person is the smart secretary Effie.<br />Lapse into the smoky, shadowed world of old San Francisco, where men and women from across the world pursue a priceless treasure.

What's not to love?<br />Smith is a mystery man, an ex-assassin who has joined his cousin in a caravan going from dusty Troon to Salesh, with a sickly half-demon playboy Lord Ermenwyr and his beautiful nurse, a mysterious courier, the capable cook Mrs. Smith, a cold Yendri healer, a sulky runner, and a load of glass butterflies. As the caravan proceeds, they thwart attacks<br />When the caravan arrives (minus a few passengers), the butterflies are shattered and Smith and his friends have to open a hotel, only to have a celebrity guest croak in the middle of an orgiastic festival of free love. One verbal mage duel and a few surprises later, a Yendri sacred site is endangered, and a race war may break out -- with religious Yendri fanatics seeking out a mythical object that could wipe out all human beings.<br />When the first page casually mentions the \\"Festival of the Respiratory Masks,\\" you can tell you've got a winner. This is not a tightly-written book, but it makes up for its lack of tightness with continuous humor and a cool invented world with interesting magic, some rather weird demons, and invented fantasy races whose \\"magic\\" is scientific in nature (the Yendri doc's explanation of infection is a hoot).<br />Fans of Terry Pratchett will find some similarities in \\"Anvil\\": Smith is somewhat reminiscent of Sam Vimes, and the humor is like a mildly racier version of Pratchett's. The verbal duel is pure genius, where two mages call each other names -- and magically transform one another (\\"I know you are, but what am I?!\\"). And like Pratchett, Baker manages to toss in a little social commentary -- religion, enviromental problems -- without being preachy.<br />The main problem lies in the structure. \\"Anvil\\" was originally three novellas, and so the story is divided into three main parts. What's wrong with that? Only the barest threads seem to tie the plotlines of the first two to the third climactic one. The dialogue is spectacular, especially when the demon siblings are bickering (\\"You can't tell us to shut up. We're DEMONS\\"; \\"You're going to break heads! You're going to rip off limbs! You're going to do amusing things with entrails!\\")<br />Smith is a likable guy, solid and essentially honest in nature. Mrs. Smith is a pleasant older woman whose respectable appearance hides her racy past; Willowspear and Burnbright are okay but not amazing. It's fussy, sickly, blunt, underage-playboy-mage-turned-junior-gigolo Lord Ermenwyr who really steals the show, whether he's resurrecting demons or whining about his food.<br />\\"Anvil of the World\\" is one of those books that begs for a sequel.

Still waters run deep, and quaint towns run weird. While it's not Davies' best work, it's still entertaining and quite amusing.<br />An amateur production of Shakespeare's &quot;The Tempest&quot; is being put on in Salterton, under the guidance of Ms. Valentine, and a seemingly random assortment of people arrive to audition. The usual problems -- revealing &quot;arty&quot; costumes, warring auditions, simmering rivalries, and some rare old books -- crop up, with a few extras in the bargain.<br />Hector Mackilwraith, a prissy, aging teacher, joins because of his crush on the beautiful heiress Griselda Webster. But Griselda is flirting with womanizing soldier Roger, who's romancing her to gain a sense of class, and is worshiped by the colorless Pearl. The relationships and mistakes they make come to a climax as the &quot;Tempest&quot; begins to storm...<br />Anyone who's watched &quot;Midwinter's Tale&quot; knows that putting on a play is never a picnic, and it's even worse when there's internal tension and weird actors. There's a sense of the fantastical around &quot;Tempest Tost,&quot; even though nothing really fantasy-like happens. His tone is less barbed than traditional satire, but no less amusing or insightful. His style is a good combination of the more formal styles of the early twentieth-century and the more streamlined style of more recent times.<br />Where the book excels is character development. The plot really has no beginning or end; it just stops after awhile. The characters just border on parody, with fussy teachers, effusive &quot;bad girls,&quot; gypsy philosophers, slick serial womanizers, precocious teens, pompous professors, and more. Humphrey Cobbler, who is a sort of gypsy philosopher, is the most vivid and engaging guy in here.<br />The characters are very multifaceted, like real people. Roger is an expert portrait of a human Ken doll who feels no need to be anything else; Griselda and Freddy are the slightly fickle but kindly daughters of an eccentric; the Torso seems like she'll be a pain at first, but is revealed to be a diamond in the rough.

Though his first few books were wobbly, &quot;The Whistle, the Grave, and the Ghost&quot; shows that Strickland has settled solidly into Bellairs' niche.<br />Lewis Barnavelt, on a camping trip with his Scout troop, wanders away from the campfire. He soon finds a dirty silver whistle, and a strange grave with the inscription &quot;Hic Iacet Lamia&quot; (Here Lies Lamia). That night, something rips a hole in his tent. Uneasy about the whistle and grave, Lewis investigates further, and discovers that a lamia is an ancient female vampire. Rose Rita dismisses the idea, but Lewis is dubious -- especially when he has dreams about an eyeless creature sniffing him out.<br />Mrs. Zimmerman and Uncle Jonathan investigate the woods, and don't find anything odd. But when Lewis is cornered by a couple of bullies, he finds the whistle in his pocket, and blows it. A snakelike creature appears and attacks the boys, who are hospitalized with a strange blood problem. And Lewis learns that there was something in that grave that wants not just his blood -- but his life. His friends seek out the help of the only person who can stop the lamia...<br />It's getting harder and harder to tell the difference between vintage Bellairs and the newer stuff by Strickland. Strickland has gained the knack for creepy dreams, horrific monsters with visceral shocks, and bits of old myth and legend. He's also incorporated the Roman Catholic elements that Bellairs did, in the priest Father Foley, who plays a key part.<br />The pacing and descriptions are spot-on, and the creepy visions and gradual buildup of tension are well-done. Lewis's subtle changes as the lamia starts to take him over are especially well-done. The primary flaw is that the climactic battle is rather fragmented (it just isn't fair to end a chapter like Chapter Thirteen was).<br />Lewis is well-written here, the bullied underdog with the occasional dark impulse; Rose Rita is the matter-of-fact counterpart whose duty it is to work out what is going wrong in her friend. Mrs. Zimmerman and Jonathan Barnavelt are their old lovable selves.<br />With &quot;The Whistle, the Grave and the Ghost,&quot; Strickland's steady footing on the Bellairs series is reestablished.

Despite worldwide fame, Ingrid Bergman's life was riddled with tragedies and problems, including an affair that could have wrecked her career.<br />Ingrid Bergman lost her parents, then her beloved aunt, as a young girl. Growing up in Nazi Germany, she soon became an actress and rose to fame, first in Sweden and then in Hollywood. Then problems arose -- Ingrid met one of her favorite directors, Roberto Rossellini, and left her husband for a whirlwind movie shoot/love affair. The scandal was overwhelming, and it was years until the stigma evaporated -- after which Ingrid was appreciated all over again for her talent and courage.<br />Donald Spoto's telling of Bergman's life is solid and informative, with quotations by Ingrid, her husbands, children, costars, directors, and lots of other people who had known her. Letters are reproduced, and her different performances are analyzed (some of these movies were downright terrible).<br />He also does a pretty good job of analyzing Ingrid's motivations -- why she was attracted to the elitist Peter and passionate Roberto, her strong artistic sense, her workaholic attitude, and her feelings about her children and loves. It's a pretty good analysis, overall.<br />Despite the title, the book isn't a dirt-fest. In fact, that's one of its weaknesses. Oh, it shouldn't be showing only her flaws, but Spoto seems to adore her a little too much. She herself is quoted as saying that she's imperfect. Even though Spoto reveals her weaknesses and failures, he doesn't seem to think any of them really matter.<br />It definitely could have used better perspective, but &quot;Notorious: The Life of Ingrid Bergman&quot; is a solid, interesting, well-written look at the life of a talented, artistic woman. Highly recommended.	2003-10-20

Doug Chiang's detailed artwork can't be faulted, and stops the book from being a total loss, but Orson Scott Card's accompanying novella is just plain bad.<br />It tells the tale of how robots conquered our world, destroying civilization and turning mankind into slaves in a vast jungle. On the world called Robota, a robot called Kaantur-Set rules through a living corpse called Font Prime. But one day a mysterious man with no memory arrives with a sentient monkey, encountering the &quot;cubed&quot; beasts and outlaw humans. And a revolution is formed against the robots...<br />Card should leave robot fiction in the realm of Asimov. Some authors can make robots seem real, through tiny nuances; Card doesn't have the subtlety to do that, and so his robots -- with the exception of the weird Elyseo -- are flat and completely unsatisfactory as a threat.<br />To make things worse, this seems like half a story rather than a complete one. All the REALLY interesting stuff, such as the jewel, &quot;cubing&quot; (turning animals into sentient creatures), the alien Olm, Font Prime's preservation, the destruction of our civilization and retaking of Robota, are mentioned but never dealt with. Which is a shame, because the actual novel is rushed and rather boring. The climactic battle sputters out before it really starts.<br />Caps is absolutely insufferable. He's merely dull when he has amnesia, but when he turns into a robot-human prophet he's impossible to like. Beryl is a warrior Barbie. Kaantur-Set is a cut-out villain, whose constant screeching makes him/her hard to take seriously. Only Elyseo (weird robot) and Rend (weird monkey) have any worthwhile personality.<br />The saving grace is Chiang's artwork. He's worked for years with Lucasfilms, and that shows. It's careful, detailed, nuanced and sometimes looks like a photograph taken in an action scene. Some of the pictures are beautiful, some are outright horrific. (Star Wars buffs may want to check out certain fight photographs, which resemble concept artwork for the movies)<br />Without Chiang's artwork, this book would have been utterly worthless. The novella is dull and pointless, but the pictures are pretty and vivid, really outstanding as illustrations. Taken together, the book is merely mediocre.are beautiful, some are outright horrific.

Her reminiscences and thoughts add up to both an entertaining read and a glimpse back in time.<br />The story behind the Pillow Book is that when Shonagon (possible real name: Nagiko) was serving the Imperial Family, the Empress received a bunch of notebooks that she couldn't use, so she gave them to Shonagon. Part diary, part lists, part essays on things around her, the Pillow Book pretty much defies classification.<br />One of the most intriguing things about the Pillow Book is the glimpse into tenth-century Japan that it gives. Shonagon's stories are about little things like flutes, disobedient dogs, clothes, and the Empress's ladies betting on how long it would take a giant mound of snow to melt (no, I'm not kidding). It makes the past seem a little less distant. And the people in it seem more like people and less like historical paper dolls. An example is the Empress chatting as her hair is being done one morning.<br />It's pretty obvious that Shonagon was a bright and witty woman, although she could be quite a snob. However, her appreciation for simple pleasures will probably win over readers. Her charming love of beauty is often enchanting; she often lists things that she finds pleasing, such as moons, summer nights, flowers and willow trees.<br />She also listed her pet peeves (such as parents worshiping a very unappealing child -- something that made me chuckle), things she found depressing or annoying. A stickler for form and ettiquette, she had very precise ideas about how things should be done (right down to how lovers should act).<br />&quot;The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon&quot; is beautifully-written and highly entertaining. You don't have to be well-versed in this sort of literature to appreciate this unique memoir by a unique woman.nique woman.	2003-10-16

It has some good points, but overall an unsatisfying book.<br />The book starts off with a comprehensive timeline of Spinal Tap, followed by a meticulous transcript of the mockumentary, transcripts of the film outtakes, song lyrics ranging from goofy ballads to hard-rock fiascos like &quot;Sex Farm.&quot; Finally there is an A-to-Z that lists not only stuff in &quot;This is Spinal Tap,&quot; but all the rock bands that influenced it.<br />One of the problems with the book is the transcript. It's a good transcript (it includes ad-libs, stammers and stuff like that) but still only a transcript. It includes all the words but none of the action, which means you need to have seen the movie to understand anything at all. The song lyrics are pretty well-documented, but have some flaws. What's more, there isn't much background info to them. Why not tell us what's up with the kiddie ballad &quot;All The Way Home&quot;?<br />The A-Z reference is both tiring and informative. Wading through a sea of rock trivia that is half fiction and half fact can be a headache. But it offers more insights into the cut scenes from &quot;This Is Spinal Tap,&quot; not to mention the influences behind it. (For example, Jeanine Pettibone was influenced by Anita Pallenberg as well as Yoko Ono)<br />It's not bad, but it fails to be good. Die-hard Tap fans may be interested in the lesser-known bits of trivia, and can use the transcript to identify what that drowned-out line was. But beyond that, it isn't a particularly useful guide.	2003-10-14

It's hard to read this excruciating little book without feeling queasy.<br />The book traces the Kennedy family back to the immigrants escaping impoverished Ireland (a protracted and very dull chapter) to the assassination of JFK, to the death of JFK Jr. and his wife Carolyn. The genuinely tragic material (David Kennedy's psychological breakdown and drug OD, for example) is buried below more sentimental slop, the type of writing that perpetuated the Camelot myth in the first place.<br />New material isn't really to be found in this book; most of it can be found elsewhere. The only possible new material is his continuous negative coverage of Carolyn Bessette, whom Klein pours venom on continuously (even to the point of saying presumptuously what Jackie would have thought of her). The Kennedys themselves get off lightly; even Teddy and Joe are carefully whitewashed. Most of them aren't even dealt with; the book is surprisingly skinny, and most of the supposed tragedies Klein mentions are never really elaborated on.<br />Perhaps most absurd is Klein's desperate clinging to the myth of the \\"Kennedy Curse.\\" Despite saying that they're narcissistic and thrillseeking, he claims that a supernatural curse is the only reason why the extended family could possibly have all these problems. Choosing to use cocaine, avoid basic safety measures, leave a girl in a submerged car, seduce the babysitter and ski backwards are not signs of a curse -- it's just recklessness, based on free choice. Why should I sympathize?<br />Many of the other deaths and problems are hardly unique --  alcoholism, cancer, strokes and various other problems. Sad, to be sure, but I doubt that if you counted all the relatives of ANY large family, that you would find anything different. He even claims the early death of immigrant Patrick Kennedy from tuberculosis must be the start of the \\"Kennedy curse.\\" Again, far from unique.<br />Fans and foes of \\"America's first family\\" will find nothing new here, unless they happen to hate Carolyn Bessette. A literary bow-and-scrape, a drooling love letter to the Kennedy family in general, this book would serve a better existance as a paperweight.h of immigrant Patrick Kennedy from tuberculosis must be the start of the \\"Kennedy curse.\\" Again, far from unique.<br />Fans and foes of \\"America's first family\\" will find nothing new here, unless they happen to hate Carolyn Bessette.

It's a dark fantasy triumph with a new and nastier villain, plenty of ugly demons, and ambiguous characters galore. Though a few plot twists are broadcast way in advance, it's a solid sequel that doesn't slip into the same sort of plot as the first book.<br />At Ravenscliff, Devon March meets the new caretaker -- a gnome. Devon is shocked when the supposedly friendly Bjorn Forkbeard directs him to the Stairway Through Time, which takes him to what seems to be a Hellhole. To make things worse, Edward Muir (Alexander's father) shows up with his new fiancee, Morgana, who seems to have a certain druglike effect on the men around her. Cecily and her mother loathe Morgana instantly, which puts Devon's new relationship to the test.<br />That's the last thing Devon needs, because he has been hearing strange laughter and weeping, and demons are creeping through Ravenscliff. Isobel the Apostate, a powerful witch burned five hundred years ago by the Nightwing sorcerers, has returned to open the Hellhole. To make things worse, Devon has a hideous vision of demons overrunning Ravenscliff and killing his friends -- and is told that he will cause that to happen. To save the present from Isobel, he will travel through time and space to medieval England-- and learns a hideous truth about his own past.<br />The Ravenscliff series is darker, grittier and more twisted than the Harry Potter series and similar fantasy tales. It's New England gothic without being over-the-top, complete with haunted houses, graveyards, weird caretakers and undead sorcery. Somehow, Huntington manages to avoid being bogged down in cliche -- although his cliffhanger will leave readers howling.<br />His handling of the Nightwing sorcerers in old England is very well-done, once he gets past the initial awkwardness of time travel. The main stumbling block is Morgana's identity, which I figured out in a few pages. However, the handling of succubus/witch Isobel is phenomenal; she's genuinely scary from the first chapter onward. And the lingering question of who the weeping women in the basement is, and what connection she has with Bjorn and Devon, is a fantastic subplot. (Although having the old lady die just before revealing Devon's secret made me groan)<br />Huntington keeps up the good work with Devon's character development, especially since nobody tells him anything. His growing dread and confusion are excellently done. Bjorn Forkbeard is a nice addition, especially since it's genuinely hard to tell what he's thinking. Edward Muir is a blueprint for an irresponsible rotter; the other supporting characters are generally solid.<br />Though there are a few flaws at Ravenscliff, the sequel to &quot;Sorcerers of the Nightwing&quot; is a fine piece of dark fantasy that won't disappoint. &quot;Demon Witch&quot; definitely casts a spell.dling of succubus/witch Isobel is phenomenal; she's genuinely scary from the first chapter onward.

Girl and boy correspond throughout their lives. That more or less sums up &quot;Love Letters,&quot; a two-person play by A.R. Gurney about two people who grow up in tune with each other's written words.<br />Andrew Makepeace Ladd III (&quot;Andy&quot;) and Melissa Gardner first write to one another when Melissa asks Andy to her birthday party. Their writings continue, growing longer and more familiar as they seek friendship in their respective boarding schools. They sympathize (and amiably bicker) throughout marriages, children, divorces, love affairs, and careers that take them down (and up) different paths.<br />The simplicity of &quot;Love Letters&quot; is what makes it work. Gurney doesn't ram anything down your throat -- rather than saying that Andy's first marriage to a Japanese girl didn't work out, he writes Andy as simply saying that he doesn't want to talk about it, and that it's over. And despite the differences between a tragic, free-spirited artist and a down-to-earth lawyer-turned-politician, Gurney shows that they're alike under the skin.<br />Their actual love affair in middle-age is a bit of a bump in the road. Not because their love isn't convincing (it's more than convincing!), but because it seems like a distraction from their affair of words. Rather dull by comparison, actually, to have them both agonizing about their love and responsibilities. However, the final eulogistic letter from Andy is sweet, sad and sensitive, one of the best theatrical scenes I've ever read.<br />It's a sweet, simple romantic play about on-paper soulmates. Recommended, especially for romantics and those putting on plays on a budget.	2003-10-09

No, not Harry Potter -- Timothy Hunter, a bespectacled young wiz who predates the present wizardmania. The second of Carla Jablonski's novelizations (of Neil Gaiman's graphic novels) is a pleasant enough adaptation, but really adds nothing.<br />The land of Faerie is dying. The falconer Tamlin (who can turn into a bird), onetime lover of Queen Titania, seeks to bring it back to life, but the haughty queen won't listen to him. Faerie has been disconnected from the mortal world, and now it's withering away. Who can help it? Timothy Hunter might.<br />Timothy, still adjusting to the knowledge of his magical ability, is suddenly faced with a new question -- who is his father? The man he's always lived with and called &quot;Dad,&quot; or Tamlin? His questions are violently answered when he encounters a horrific beast that is destroying Faerie. To save Faerie, will Tim die?<br />&quot;Bindings&quot; takes the story Gaiman created in the first &quot;Book of Magic&quot; and uses it as a springboard. There are new characters, a new tone, a faster pace, and the start of an overhanging story arc about Faerie, Titania and Tim's mysterious past. Things suddenly get a whole lot more complex.<br />Unfortunately, Jablonski's novelization really doesn't do anything for the story -- it's a good story but it could have been much, much better. It evokes little, describes little, and the main additions are minor scenes that weren't in the graphic novel. There's a little more insight into the thoughts of Tamlin and Tim, but the lack of description becomes a little frustrating.<br />While &quot;Books of Magic 2: Bindings&quot; makes a nice companion piece to the graphic novels, it's not immensely gripping on its own. A good fantasy story, given a middling treatment.	2003-10-08

The sequel, &quot;Year of the Griffin,&quot; takes a slightly different turn, focusing on some rather strange young wizards-in-training, as they try to keep themselves in the frying pan rather than the fire.<br />Because the offworld tours have stopped, money has become scarce. Wizard Corkoran, the new head of Wizard University (who is obsessed with reaching the moon), hopes to soak the parents of the new first years. They consist of a mysterious young foreigner, a pirate girl, an impoverished prince, a half-Marsh girl with a jinx, a runaway dwarf, and the griffin daughter of Wizard Derk. None of them have any money, and quite a few aren't even supposed to be there. To top it off, their magic is anything but normal.<br />When Corkoran stupidly sends out money-seeking letters to their parents and relatives, the students start trying to magically protect themselves from the Emir, a pirate, the dwarf overseers, and the Romanesque Empire. Add some primitive griffins, a vindictive teacher, and some magic gone horribly awry, and it's a year to never forget... especially when they take an unexpected trip to Mars.<br />Those expecting a retread of &quot;Dark Lord&quot; will be disappointed; &quot;Year&quot; is more along the lines of &quot;students at a wizard school battle evil,&quot; albeit far more imaginatively than most books with that theme. Jones happily mashes together Roman empires, pirates, fantasy dwarves (complete with armor and underground cities), and ties it together with her previous book. Don't worry, reading &quot;Dark Lord&quot; is not necessary, though it is recommended.<br />Writing is amusing, descriptive and often pleasantly quirky; Jones never stops juggling personal quirks and weird relationships. However, the final chapters are the weakest part of the book. While the conclusion is being cooked up through the entire book, it feels a bit lifeless. The way the problems are dealt with feel a bit contrived. However, the long-suffering tiny assassins and the wandering furniture add the typical Jones sparkle to the proceedings. (Things never go quite smoothly in her worlds)<br />The quirky cast is mostly quite well done. Elda is a pleasant heroine, although her crush on Corkoran is a little distracting. Felim and Ruskin are delightful, while Olga and Lukim are just engaging. (No pun intended) Claudia and Corkoran, while well-written enough, never really come to life.<br />While not really on the same theme as &quot;Dark Lord of Derkholm,&quot; &quot;Year of the Griffin&quot; is still an entertaining fantasy tale with a bit of botched magic, student crushes, and the occasional dizzy assassin.s.

Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy is effortless. Finding some of the books analyzing it is easy. But finding something worthwhile and thought-provoking, something new and insightful? Now there's a challenge. And Greg Wright's &quot;Tolkien in Perspective&quot; rises to the challenge very well.<br />Wright wraps his analysis of Tolkien in his analysis of culture, religion, Christianity in particular, philosophy, myth and how all of the above interact. How is &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; a Christian book? What is a &quot;Christian book,&quot; anyway? What was Tolkien's intent as he wrote it? How can myths and Christianity be compatible? What is the nature of Middle-Earth's magic? Not only does Wright address such questions, he also addresses the alternative viewpoints and claims (like claims that they're evil or for druggie hippies).<br />Perhaps the biggest challenge is that since Wright (thankfully) does not dumb down the material, some of it may be unfamiliar to the readers. However, if this is not an obstacle, it may prove to be the most satisfying religious analysis of Tolkien's works. He's a fan, and clearly very well versed in Tolkien's writings as well as his fellow fans.<br />Most books shy away from Tolkien's Roman Catholic beliefs and the specifics of how that affected his trilogy. Wright doesn't do so. He's not Catholic, but he doesn't ignore or vilify that which is in Tolkien's world; his book meets the topic head-on. Perhaps most refreshingly, he strikes a good balance when looking at Tolkien himself. He doesn't blast the Master of Middle-Earth, but doesn't put him on a pedestal either. Rather, he acknowledges Tolkien as a good yet flawed (as everyone is) human being.<br />Wright's writing style is versatile, switching from scholarly and intense to almost conversational. While sometimes his analyses are a little hard to follow, they're striking and thought-provoking, especially his analysis of &quot;myth&quot; at the beginning of the book. The commentary he provides on philosophy (past, present, and Tolkien's) also adds extra dimension to his analysis and speculation.<br />If you're tired of the ready-baked analyses of &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; then &quot;Tolkien in Perspective: Sifting the Gold from the Glitter&quot; offers a fresh point of view on the religion and philosophy attached to.

After graduating from college, Ava is directionless, aimless, lonely and not feeling at home anywhere.

The thought of her mother's past haunts Helen as she stumbles across a corpse on the beach, falls in love for the first time, and starts to really get to know her mother.<br />Reading &quot;Book of Dead Birds,&quot; you can almost smell the birds and salt of the Salton Sea. Brandeis has a special talent for putting her readers into the places she writes of, even if they've never been there. And she knows how to tug at the heartstrings without straining them.<br />Brandeis's writing has an understated lyricism, a sort of poetry without self-consciousness. Her social commentary is all the stronger because it doesn't beat you over the head, and the tragedies all the more terrible because they aren't milked. Ava's sections are more introspective and far-reaching, while Helen's are starker. Sprinkled between chapters are bits of Helen's &quot;Book of Dead Birds,&quot; saddening and humorous at once.<br />Ava is a startlingly vivid character, whose life is not so much sad as it is empty. It's fantastic to see her gradually coming into the happiness she deserves. Helen is quiet, repressed, keeping her past hidden and only letting her sorrow show for the birds. Supporting characters, like the unfortunate little girl Jeniece and the fiery prostitute Sun are equally well-done.<br />As pretty and deceptively simple-looking as a bird, this book is a haunting, ultimately heartwarming look at mothers and daughters. Highly recommended.antastic to see her gradually coming into the happiness she deserves. Helen is quiet, repressed, keeping her past hidden and only letting her sorrow show for the birds.

Tolkien was the literary giant whose \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy turned fantasy books from slightly odd literary blips into a full-blown genre. Not quite as well-known are his smaller fantasy tales, translations and the backdrop of Middle-Earth itself. Now his lesser-known (but still wonderful) books are released in a boxed set.<br />\\"The Tolkien Reader\\" is a mishmash of material both by and about Tolkien, including an essay by noted fantasy writer Peter Beagle, a short play, a story/reflection on writing and mortality, the hilarious comic fantasy \\"Farmer Giles of Ham,\\" and a series of poems -- ranging from gloomy to cute to sad -- focusing on Tom Bombadil and Middle-Earth.<br />\\"The Silmarillion\\" is a the type of book that many authors have tried to emulate, but still stands unrivalled: The Bible of Middle-Earth. This is the history of the Elves and Middle-Earth, from Eru (God) creating the world and the races on it, through wars and disasters, until the events of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" itself, when the Elves finally leave Middle-Earth forever.<br />\\"Unfinished Tales\\" fills in a few of the mystery gaps in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"The Hobbit.\\" Want to know more about Gandalf, Bilbo, Galadriel, and other people in Middle-Earth? This collection of writings, organized by Tolkien's son, offers more insights into the world of Middle-Earth.<br />\\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\\" steps out of Tolkien's imagination, and into classic Arthurian fantasy. It's the story of Sir Gawain, and how after being challenged by a mysterious Green Knight, must forfeit his own head. Added on to it are Tolkien's translations of the beautiful poem \\"Pearl,\\" and \\"Sir Orfeo,\\" a tale rooted in the legend of Orpheus and Eurydice.<br />Tolkien's full writing range is put on display in these books. He wrote comic fantasy about inept farmers and easily-intimidated dragons, and he also wrote sweeping fictional histories that spanned thousands of years. He wrote cute poems about dancing elf kids, melancholy poetry, and upbeat songs about the Man in the Moon. He wrote elaborate backstories for Middle-Earth, but also translated the classic Arthurian tale of Sir Gawain. In these stories, he proved that he could write (and translate) just about any style of fantasy imaginable, without it seeming stale or strained.<br />From charming to mind-bogglingly complicated, the \\"Tolkien Fantasy Tales\\" are a great way to introduce yourself to the full range of Tolkien's genius.

Before its voluntary departure from the Washington Post, &quot;Liberty Meadows&quot; had gained a loyal following that brought it back from possible cancellation more than once. Now this kooky strip and its bizarre characters are back in this book, &quot;Liberty Meadows 1: Eden.&quot;<br />Welcome to Liberty Meadows, an animal preserve overseen by timid vet Frank and beautiful animal shrink Brandy. As Frank tries to muster the courage to ask Brandy out,  the two of them also have to deal with the nutty animals there: a crazed Cow, Leslie the hypochondriac bullfrog, Ralph the tiny belligerant bear, Truman the water-fearing duck, and Dean the chauvinist pig in rehab.<br />This loony crew tries to deal with dates (where Brandy's crazed ex tries to kill Frank), the evil catfish Khan, camping trips with psychedelic mushrooms, falls into mine shafts, severed noses, truck-sized ticks, the insane stalker Cow kidnapping a celebrity and -- worst of all -- Dean's trip through the land of Cold Turkey.<br />You'd be hard-pressed to find a weirder comic strip than Liberty Meadows. Frank Cho combines the realistic drawing style (Frank and Brandy) with more traditional cartoon styles (the animals, and supporting humans like the handyman). Filled with wry pokes at pop culture and political correctness, it's refreshing and amusing in a sea of stale comics.<br />If you weren't lucky enough to read &quot;Liberty Meadows&quot; during its stint in the papers, check out &quot;Liberty Meadows: Eden.&quot; Silly, weird, bizarre, and immensely entertaining, this is definitely worth a read.	2003-09-25
968645:US	50881246	R36P5O1XO2KST	0375700889	619497840	The House of Sleep	Books	2	1	2	N	N	House of snoozes	Jonathan Coe's books are usually vividly witty, biting and occasionally outright scathing, with characters that are usually either very human or distant and weird. \\"The House of Sleep\\" is a morbidly snoozy exception, with an unbalanced plot and characters as gray and forgettable as a dream.<br />It centers on the sleep disorders of a bunch of students: Sarah, a narcoleptic who thinks her dreams are the reality. Gregory, her boyfriend, who has some kinky sexual practices involving her eyes. Terry, a movie snob who used to have idyllic dreams, and who is seeking the \\"perfect\\" arthouse film.<br /><br />As time goes on, Sarah still feels an odd attraction for Robert, even though she is now dating the dripping-with-joie-de-vivre lesbian Veronica; Robert, in turn, is desperately seeking her. Terry's weird movie obsessions alienate those around him, and Gregory has since become a man obsessed with eradicating sleep itself.<br /><br />Some of the problems with \\"House of Sleep\\" lie in the plotting. Coe falls back on cliches unworthy of his writing, like the letter-tucked-in-a-book, something more worthy of shlockmaster Nicholas Sparks rather than a writer of Coe's caliber. Not to mention Robert's method of reconciling his love for Sarah, which was both unexpected and, in context, more than a little silly. It felt slapped in, as if Coe were thinking, \\"How can I fix this whole situation with a guy in love with a lesbian? I know!\\"<br /><br />Much of the character interactions ultimately hinge on psychobabble, where all of them (especially Sarah) are picked apart. Ultimately, the arguments just aren't that convincing. And without the arguments, the character interactions make no sense. That same psychobabble also sucks the book dry of wit, humor, or acerbity. The writing is undeniably poetic and vivid, and Coe's usual delicacy with words, descriptions and dialogue save this from being a fiasco.<br /><br />Sarah is a lifeless character, who doesn't connect with anyone and just sits in a corner staring at her knees. She's apparently supposed to be sensitive, but seems instead to feel nothing. Robert is a dead fish; Gregory descends into near-madness, and Terry is just a jerk. Feminist/lesbian banker Veronica is the most likable, vivid and well-written character in the book.<br /><br />Despite the witty turns of \\"Rotter's Club\\" and \\"Winshaw Legacy,\\" Coe's second novel seems like Sarah wrote it in her sleep. Lame, pallid and not really worth it except as a study of wordcraft.She's apparently supposed to be sensitive, but seems instead to feel nothing.

The author cuts right to the chase in the second book of the Seventh Tower series, &quot;Castle,&quot; by picking up where &quot;The Fall&quot; left off. Things get darker and tenser, and the mystery becomes even more twisted.<br />Tal's family is being mysteriously victimized, and will become outcasts unless he can get into the mystical land of Aenir. But now he's captive of the Icecarls, and is the grudging ally of the tough wannabe-shieldmaiden Milla. After meeting with the ancient Mother Crone, Tal agrees to help sneak Milla in, so they can both find Sunstones -- he for his family, she for her people.<br />But they have more trouble. After getting inside and consulting with Uncle Ebbitt, he tells them that they must find the Codex in Aenir. Then things take a hideous turn: The two kids are captured. Tal is imprisoned in the Pit -- and discovers something about his father's fate. And Milla is trapped with the half-shadow-half-man monster Fashnek, in the Hall of Nightmares...<br />Though &quot;Castle&quot; is not as strong as &quot;Fall,&quot; it's a darker, weirder story that adds to the mystery. Why does Sushin hate Tal and his family so much? What is happening to the Sunstones, if they're dying and becoming useless? And who was the mysterious Longface, a Chosen taken in by the Icecarls -- what was he terrified of?<br />Nix's talent for fantastical horror is also more evident here, in the hideous Fashnek, who has an insectile shadow-claw over part of his body. While &quot;Fall&quot; was pretty much pure fantasy, &quot;Castle&quot; has the darker, more macabre bits -- probably even more as the series progresses. And his talent for creating familiar but alien cultures now extends to the Icecarls as well as the Chosen.<br />Tal was a well-rounded character to start with, and he doesn't disappoint in this book. Milla gets a bit more depth, and shows some liking for Tal and Uncle Ebbitt. She softens a little bit, while being no less tough. Uncle Ebbit is likably quirky, but more serious, and the Mother Crone is an intriguing old wisewoman.<br />The second part of the &quot;Seventh Tower&quot; series is a little darker than the first book, and a little more of what fans expect from Nix. And he knows when to stop, just to make them dash eagerly for &quot;Aenir.&quot;being no less tough.

Now Marianne Faithfull offers her own side of the story of during and after that time, with dry wit and fractured nostalgia. If you ever heard the stories about Marianne, then hear what she has to say.<br />Marianne Faithfull was born the daughter of an idealistic British gentleman and a haughty countess, and schooled in a convent that sheltered her from the outside world. All that went out the window when she came into contact with the blossoming rock'n'roll scene, and was recruited by Rolling Stones manager Andrew Oldham into recording pop song &quot;As Tears Go By.&quot; Soon afterwards, Marianne was wooed by rock star Mick Jagger, and left her husband to live with Jagger.<br />At first, it seemed fantastic; Marianne lived in a haze of drugs, music and glamour with Jagger, the doomed Brian Jones, darkly intriguing Keith Richards, and the fascinating Anita Pallenberg. It was a time of rebellion, shifting sexuality, drugs and general strangeness. But criminal trials, addictions and Jagger's dalliances caused cracks in their relationship. After Marianne and Jagger broke up, she descended into heroin addiction, and her son was taken away. But she pulled herself up out of her addiction and released a new kind of music -- music that reflected her past, in all its darkness.<br />Marianne's memoir is refreshingly just and honest -- she gives people like Jagger their due, only speaking badly when it's called for. She not only speaks out on the sexism of the press toward her (and their revolting, idiotic Mars bar story), but also about the hideous consequences it almost had for her mother Eva. Looking back on the fur rug and the handling of Marianne's presence, it's hard to believe that such ghastly mishandling of the facts could take place and actually be believed for so long. When the press turned on the Stones, they also turned on Marianne.<br />And she's the first to admit (many times) that she's made mistakes; if anything, she seems harder on herself than anyone else, recognizing when she should have done better, spoken up, acted differently. (Such as when she blasted Jagger during an emotional moment) What's more, she offers greater insight into Richards, Jagger, Pallenberg, Bob Dylan and others -- not just about them, but the effect they had on people around them. (Richards' Byronic presence, Jones' tormented baby pictures, Pallenberg's hypnotic effect -- all these are amazing insights) And she doesn't pretend that her post-junkie life and romantic relationships were idyllic -- there are low points and high points, stumbles and falls. But it's inspiring to see her releasing new music and overcoming her past problems.<br />The writing is wonderfully vivid, reading almost like a novel at times; Faithfull intersperses her rockspeak with literary and mythologic references (the Lady of Shalott is mentioned multiple times) that give &quot;Faithfull&quot; added sophistication. She also doesn't glorify the drug use that almost killed her; it's pretty horrifying for awhile there despite her initial romantic ideas about it. Faithfull also demonstrates a dry sense of humor that made me chuckle. (Lacking a true finale, she ends the book with cooking tips)<br />A weaker woman than Marianne Faithfull might have been killed by all she's gone through.

And some are just ink on paper, not actually formulating into an engaging story. &quot;Louse,&quot; unfortunately, is one of the third kinds of books. Failing to evoke anything at all, it ends up being as sterile and dull as the penthouse.<br />Herbert Horatio  Blackwell is a reclusive, eccentric mogul who hides away from the world (and germs) in a carefully sterilized penthouse atop a casino. He employs and controls compulsive gamblers, who pay off their debts by sacrificing their long-term memories and becoming his devoted slaves. One of these is his manservant Herman Louse.<br />In the detached little community of G, Louse encounters a subversive element. This is a problem, since he has been brainwashed into subservience. But as he tries to ignore the conspiracy brewing around him, he inadvertantly gets drawn into it.<br />&quot;Louse&quot; does pretty well in concept, with its bizarre otherworldly setting, strange characters and robotic civilization. It's hard to tell if this surreal setting is even in our world. And the concept of a &quot;king&quot; who controls people is always a winner, especially if there's a twist. In concept, at least, David Grand cannot be faulted.<br />The problem with &quot;Louse&quot;? Unlike Kafka, it fails to evoke any emotional response at all. Kafka could evoke horror, misery and despair. Grand can't do that. It's arguable that this is deliberate, a reflection of the sterile life that Louse and the others are leading, but there's no emotion in scenes like Louse's flashbacks, or near the end. Everything is painfully clinical and detached, even when some kind of vividity is called for.<br />The dialogue is almost as bad. The characters tend to exchange short, random sentences that sound like Hemingway on acid. The descriptions are uneven and minimal, and most of the supporting characters have only a few words to describe them physically or mentally. This is not so bad, because virtually all of them speak and seem to think alike.<br />Blackwell is hard to take seriously, since he's so obviously a copy of Howard Hughes (the lives of his parents, his movies, planes, and phobia about bacteria). Louse isn't a particularly engaging narrator -- one of the problems with a narrator who feels nothing is that the reader then feels nothing. Supporting characters are similarly two-dimensional.<br />&quot;Louse&quot; has an unengaging title and an unexciting storyline. Not recommended for those who like even a spark of inspiration in their book reading.se virtually all of them speak and seem to think alike.<br />Blackwell is hard to take seriously, since he's so obviously a copy of Howard Hughes (the lives of his parents, his movies, planes, and phobia about bacteria).

Having temporarily abandoned her melodramatic vampires, Atwater-Rhodes draws on the most popular works of Shakespeare and Laurell K. Hamilton. One wonders why she still tries.<br />Danica Shardae is the heir of the avian (bird) shapeshifter throne, which is at war with the serpiente (snake) race, and has been for many generations. After the death of one of the serpiente heirs, his sister Irene Cobriana appears at the Hawk's Keep to ask for peace talks in the land of the Mistari (tigers). Reluctantly, Danica's mother accepts.<br /><br />But when they arrive, the heir Zane Cobriana makes a strange offer to Danica: Peace can be achieved if they are married. (Or, as Atwater-Rhodes puts it, he chooses her as his naga and she chooses him as her alistair) Reluctantly, Danica agrees -- but her mother does not. As they plot secretly to wed when both are declared rulers of their people, strange assassins lurk in the shadows to somehow stop their marriage.<br /><br />It's never a good sign when a book has a glaring flaw on the first page. In this case, it's the use of the masculine name \\"Alasdair\\" (the Celtic form of Alistair) for a female character. Not a great way to start. While Atwater-Rhodes has smoothed out some of the flaws of her earlier writing, such as zooming fast to the finish, it's still too self-conscious, too formulaic. The revelations about the assassins (who act like four-year-olds) are awkward and stilted, as if she merely got tired of writing and wanted to finish quickly.<br /><br />\\"Hawksong\\" has a lot of the problems her previous books have: Supporting characters are paper-thin (the bodyguards, fussy in-laws, and flaky seamstress most notably). Everyone is gorgeous. Every nonhuman has some outstanding characteristic like weird eyes. Nobody falls in love because they want to, just because she feels the need to include a love story. All attractive men give off a sexy-danger vibe and move gracefully. And she spends a lot more time thinking about cool names for different stuff than she does making the characters worthwhile. (It wouldn't have detracted from the book if she hadn't fussed so much with all the different terms for a spouse)<br /><br />While Danica is thankfully not the tough-girl caricatures present in Atwater-Rhodes' last three books, she's pretty dull. She doesn't have much motivation to suddenly take mercy on Zane's brother, supposedly the defining moment of her characte; she never acts, only reacts. We never get to know Zane very well, because he has no depth. He smolders and sizzles a lot, then turns into a tender, sensitive, ineffective wuss, much like the male leads of her prior books.<br /><br />While this stands above the prior books of Atwater-Rhodes, that's still pretty low. \\"Hawksong\\" isn't so much a mess as a flat, featureless, flavorless mass.racefully.

But Dashiell Hammet was responsible for a lot more -- the hardboiled crime novel as we know it today, with femme fatales, charmingly sinister crooks and cynical antiheroes.<br />&quot;Red Harvest&quot; introduces the Continental Op, cool-as-a-cucumber private detective who arrives in Personvilles (often pronounced &quot;Poisonville&quot;) for a client, Donald Wilson, who has been suddenly murdered. Soon the Continental Op finds himself being hired by Donald's father Elihu to clean up Personville. To do so, he'll have to fight fire with fire, and play dirty with the many dangerous crooks.<br />&quot;The Dain Curse&quot; starts off with an ordinary diamond heist where things don't seem quite right. It soon leads the Continental Op to Gabrielle Leggett, a young woman with a drug habit, an attachment to a cult, a bizarre family secret, and who is convinced in the &quot;Dain Curse&quot; that has supposedly slain her entire family. The Op sets out to discover the origins of the cult and cure Gabrielle of her drug use...<br />&quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; starts with a simple case, in which a young woman asks the private investigators Sam Spade and Miles Archer to trail her sister's lover. Except not only does she not have a sister, but she's wrapped up in a bizarre hunt for the priceless, elusive Maltese Falcon. Sam Spade must unravel a tangle of lies and murder to find out who killed Miles, and what is going on with the Falcon.<br />&quot;The Glass Key presents Ned Beaumont, a gambler-turned-murder-investigator who has to start investigating when a Senator's son is murdered. What he uncovers is more than murder, but deception, desperate political games, gangsters and money.<br />&quot;The Thin Man&quot; brings us Nick and Nora Charles, wealthy and dysfunctional New Yorkers who seem like unlikely detectives. When a friend reintroduces Nick to the family of eccentric genius Richard Wynant, they find a confusing web spun around Wynant (the Thin Man). His ex-wife has married a bitter rival, and his kids aren't being forthright. Who is the Thin Man, and what has he done?<br />Hammett's writing style is spare and to-the-point, but is shockingly vivid when it needs to be (such as the human sacrifice scene in &quot;Dain Curse&quot;). His leading men are hardened, cynical, and live by their own sense of justice, but surprisingly deep and human. The supporting characters are also good: sighing femme fatales, cultured obese gangsters, accursed damsels, charismatic cult leaders, frightened young girls, and corrupt politicians.<br />There's a certain amount of narrative awkwardness in some of the books; &quot;Curse&quot; reads like three novellas, and &quot;Harvest&quot; is virtually impossible to understand at first. Some of the books may need to be read multiple times to really absorb the story, so that their complexity and twisting storylines can be fully appreciated.<br />Only a handful of authors have managed to do what Dashiell Hammett did for the crime novel.

Things shift unexpectedly, adults cease to make any sense at all, and the love/social life suddenly becomes a lot more complex. For Jessica Darling, lead of \\"Sloppy Firsts,\\" these things are all in a day's suffering (the sort that readers can identify with).<br />Jessica Darling's junior year is not going well. Her best friend Hope has moved away, her dad only cares about her athletic success, and her mom is obsessed with her obnoxious sister's wedding (to a rich, dull guy called G-Money). She hasn't had a period in months, hangs out with a bunch of painfully dumb girls called the Clueless Crew, and longs after the beautiful yet unattainable Paul Parlipiano.<br />When a new girl named Hy moves into the neighborhood, Jess thinks she might have found a new pal -- except Hy has some secrets of her own. And \\"dreg\\" Marcus Flutie starts showing some attentiveness to Jess after she helps him fake a urine sample, while she continues to nurse her crush on Paul. All that, and she has to ask fun, normal, pleasant Scotty to her sister's wedding.<br />\\"Sloppy Firsts\\" is almost sure to make you do two things: Laugh, and cringe at memories of teenhood. More often than not, teen angst novels are excruciatingly self-conscious, cooler-than-thou and never, ever written accurately. Magazine editor and writer Megan McCafferty knocks the trend on its ear with this book, with a likable heroine who actually seems real.<br />As in many teen-oriented books, there are a lot of pop-culture references -- MTV, Christina Aguilera, half a dozen magazines, and so on. What \\"Sloppy Firsts\\" also has is also real humor (both acid comments and humiliation), developed characters, and genuine pathos. McCafferty tackles real subjects like the loss of Jessica's brother, teen sex, muddled emotions, cliques, parental relationships and expectations. All this with no preachiness. And the humor is pretty fun in general -- Jess throwing up on Paul's shoes, jokes that people don't get, dirty nicknames (\\"The Headmaster\\") and school editorials that start a catfight.<br />Jessica is a very real teenage girl. She's undeniably smart, clear-headed, and frustrated and confused by a thousand things at once. Her parents are clueless at first, but when you expect them to be the basic idiot parents, McCafferty unexpectedly blossoms them out into more sympathetic adults. The boys (Paul, Marcus, Scotty) are all mysterious to Jessica, as they should be. And the Clueless Crew's gushing exclaimations had me torn whether to gag or mock them -- everyone has met some girls like these.<br />Whether you're a teen looking for a like soul in a funny book, or an adult looking to understand a teen, \\"Sloppy Firsts\\" is a humorous, wry, endearing read.on't get, dirty nicknames (\\"The Headmaster\\") and school editorials that start a catfight. <br />Jessica is a very real teenage girl.

But Keith Ablow gives the title character of his novel a chilling spin, and lets the readers see through a window into the killer's twisted, fragmented mind. It's a freaky rollercoaster ride, and one that readers won't forget in a hurry.<br />The Highway Killer (also called Jonah) roams from one seemingly random town to another, choosing victims seemingly at random. He's attractive, intelligent, cultured, religious, a nurturing psychologist who travels from hospital to hospital -- and is overwhelmed by a dark urge to kill, to absorb the life of his victims into himself. There's no way to track him and no way to tell who he will attack next.<br />The FBI calls in Frank Clevenger, a famous forensic psychiatrist who is also trying to balance out his life with a troubled adopted son, who has been expelled for dealing drugs at his school. But he becomes enmeshed in the investigation, and soon a newspaper starts publishing front-page letters from the Highway Killer to Frank. He must use his own past, the letters, and the victims to delve into the Highway Killer's mind -- and what is driving him to murder.<br />They say you should write what you know, and Keith Ablow is a prime example of this. Like Frank, he is a forensic psychiatrist, and so he's ideal to bring us the tormented Jonah, a serial killer who is both good and evil, and who is so conflicted that he's blotted out part of his past that holds the key to his psychosis.<br />Most mystery novels can't balance out the personal and the professional -- or, better yet, tie them together. Ablow does both. Frank's personal life is tied in to why Jonah wants him to help. The writing is taut, but the best parts are when he gets inside the characters' heads, giving us a vivid picture of what they think and why.<br />Frank is an excellent protagonist; he's almost as psychologically complex as the Highway Killer. One outstanding scene is when Frank reveals the similarities between his adopted son Billy's abusive childhood and his own youth. It's a wonderful scene, and shows Ablow's tight focus on how people's minds work. Jonah is a crazy quilt of good and bad, and probably the best fictional &quot;psychopath&quot; I've ever read about. And Billy, who is struggling with his own past abuse, helps give a human edge to the aspects of Frank that are necessary to the plot.<br />&quot;Psychopath&quot; is the sort of book that can scare you stiff -- the only demons and monsters it has are the kind that really exist inside the human mind. Tightly-written, intriguing, and it'll keep you riveted up to the end.etween his adopted son Billy's abusive childhood and his own youth.

And this is \\"First Meetings\\" 2.0, with the original \\"First Meetings\\" collection being added to with an extra background story.  It's a small book, but Card never tries to flesh it out too much. It's the content of the stories that really makes it worth the buy, because of what he does with them. \\"Boy\\" adds an extra dimension to Ender's father and the situations that came years later. \\"Pest\\" is interesting, but a little too \\"talky\\" to really be outstanding. \\"Investment\\" is a nice bit of backstory, with a slightly humorous tone that makes it lighter than the books. And \\"Ender's Game\\" (the short story) is merely pleasant to read because it's nice to see how this short story blossomed and expanded.<br />Fans of Card will not be disappointed by this moderately interesting collection of stories. Pleasantly written, fleshing out both key and supporting characters, it may interest Enderverse fans but not many others.	2003-08-12

It has flaws more pronounced than Jones' later books, but is still an entertaining fantasy with hints of her present greatness.<br />Frank and Jess's dad stops their pocket money when they accidently break a chair. Desperate for money (especially since Frank owes the vicious bully Buster Knell), they begin &quot;Own Back Limited.&quot; Their first customer? Buster and his gang. Buster has had a tooth knocked out by Vernon Wilkins, and wants the Own Back kids to knock out one of Vernon's, as payment for Frank's debt. When they tell Vernon, he gets a baby tooth from his little brother (so it's still &quot;Wilkins' tooth&quot;), and all seems to be right with the world at first.<br />The problem is that soon a pair of peculiar little girls insist that the Own Back kids do something nasty to Biddy Iremonger, a weird old lady -- because they say she put a spell on the younger girl. At first Frank and Jess won't. But when Vernon's little brother becomes horribly ill, they discover that Biddy really IS a witch. And what's more, she's not too pleased about their little business...<br />This was Jones' first book, and it shows. There are some problems that were ironed out in her later novels, but there is also a sprightly unself-conscious quality to it. She builds up the menace of Biddy, making you wonder if she really is a witch at first, then revealing it in a matter-of-fact way that makes you feel almost as shocked as Jess and Frank.<br />Unfortunately, there are some distracting parts of the book -- the G-rated profanity of the bullies (&quot;eyesballs in salsa&quot;?) isn't particularly convincing. And the animosity of some of the characters is sort of brushed away and not really dealt with again again. And the supporting cast aren't as well-defined as her later characters are; they tend to blur together at times.<br />Frank and Jess are acceptable lead characters -- they seem a little too alike at times, although they become much more different by the last part of the book. Buster is a by-the-book bully, but one who thankfully is somewhat redeemed. Vernon is a likable guy, and Frankie, Jenny and Martin are somewhat more anemic.<br />Despite its flaws, &quot;Witch's Business&quot; is still a clever little fantasy mystery with plenty of weird magic, persistent British preteens, and a humorous finale.they tend to blur together at times.<br />Frank and Jess are acceptable lead characters -- they seem a little too alike at times, although they become much more different by the last part of the book.

Daneel Olivaw, Book 1)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A classic	Take a complex scifi novel and meld it with a hardboiled mystery -- the result is &quot;Caves of Steel.&quot; Isaac Asimov's most famous series continues with this book, a genre-bending trip into the future. Plenty of whodunnits and political tension, not to mention more robots.<br />Elijah Bailey, a cop in the future domed New York, is called to investigate a murder: a Spacer scientist was killed in Spacetown. Things get even worse when Lije is assigned a detective partner, Daneel Olivaw, who isn't just a Spacer -- but also a robot, albeit one who looks exactly like a human. Despite his dislike for Spacers and robots alike, Lije begins investigating the death of the scientist (who also created Daneel in his own image). Even so, his prejudices start to get in his way.<br />But the further Daneel and Lije dig, the more complex -- and sinister -- the mystery becomes. There are the Spacers, who have plans for Earth that almost no one knows about. There are the Medievalists, a growing faction of romantic-minded Earth citizens who long for the &quot;good old days&quot; and hate robots with a passion. And soon Lije discovers that the murderer might just be closer to him than he thinks...<br />&quot;Caves&quot; has aged remarkably well, considering that much of the futuristic stuff isn't particularly impressive anymore. But it's the layout of Asimov's futuristic civilization that is so impressive -- there are the overcrowded, resentful, technophobic Earth people, and the lofty, sparse, technology-loving Spacers. The vast cultural differences and friction give a feeling of deep realism. Neither civilization is portrayed as being wholly bad or good -- each has its moral and logical pros and cons. Are we headed for this? Maybe. Asimov doesn't preach too hard.<br />There are also deeper currents to a book that seems, on the surface, to be a straightforward SF/mystery. Asimov explores the mistrust, fear, lack of logic, and ignorance that keep people apart. The Spacers and Earth people have let their differences become mistrust: The overcrowded Earth people are crammed like sardines, with little food and highly regulated lives. The Spacers are underpopulated, live in luxury, and are assisted by robots.<br />Lije is a likable guy from the start; Asimov doesn't make him brilliant (he makes two erroneous accusions before figuring out the mystery) or lacking in biases. But he is determined to overcome his own shortcomings; his open-minded attitude is well-done. Daneel makes up for Lije's shortcomings by being logical and unbiased, but he doesn't have Lije's imagination.<br />A must-read for fans of science fiction and mystery, but also an intriguing read for anyone, and a captivating book for those who enjoyed &quot;I Robot.&quot;h people have let their differences become mistrust: The overcrowded Earth people are crammed like sardines, with little food and highly regulated lives.

Wrede's \\"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons,\\" bringing together four charming little fantasy stories. Wrede cleverly pokes fun at all the things you've come to expect from princess tales, including the now-cliched rebellious princess trope.<br /><br />\\"Dealing with Dragons\\" introduces Princess Cimorene, youngest daughter of the king of Linderwall. Like most medieval tomboys, Cimorene is considered rough, unseemly and stubborn -- she wants to fight with swords and learn magic. On the advice from a magic frog, she goes out in search of a dragon to be housekeeper for. But when she's not sending away valiant knights, she's dealing with some very troublesome wizards.<br /><br />\\"Searching For Dragons\\" picks up when the dragon Kazul goes mysteriously missing. Cimorene is, unsurprisingly, very concerned about this and wants to find her. Enter Mendanbar, a young king as unconventional as Cimorene -- not to mention in need of a wife. But even though he goes along to find Kazul, with wizards and laughter all around, he'll find that he's much more interested in Cimorene.<br /><br />\\"Calling on Dragons\\" skips ahead to when Cimorene and Mendanbar are mrried, and Queen Cimorene is pregnant. All is right, right? Wrong. Magic is vanishing in the Enchanted Forest; the king's sword has been stolen. To combat the troublesome wizards, Morwen the witch teams up with Cimorene, Kazul, Telemain the Magician, and a rabbit called Killer.<br /><br />\\"Talking to Dragons\\" skips ahead even further, to when Daystar is sent off by his mom Cimorene with only a magic sword. Poor kid -- he has to help King Mendanbar escape from an evil wizard's spell, without knowing that Mendanbar is his father. He teams up with a hot-tempered firewitch, Shiara, a dragon, a lizard, and a rather annoying princess. Can Daystar clue in before all is lost?<br /><br />One of the best things about \\"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles\\" is that it is a pretty decent high fantasy story -- the first book is easily the most enchanting, but the three sequels are also still pretty amusing. But while telling its own story, it's gently poking fun at the sort of things you find in these sorts of stories -- princesses, dragons, fairy godmothers and magical swords -- and how they're typically used.<br /><br />And Wrede's writing matches this plot nicely -- quirky and clever, with a slightly British bent (\\"Oh bother!\\") and plenty of humorous dialogue (\\"If they'd simply done what they were told, they wouldn't be here.\\" \\"Still, turning them into slabs of stone forever seems a little extreme\\"). Perhaps the biggest problem with the series is that the third book is rather weak at times, and the dragons are somewhat less prominent in the fourth.<br /><br />Since the Rebellious Princess is pretty standard now, it's fun to see one that doesn't whine much, even if she likes all sorts of things that aren't princessy (magic, fencing, cooking cherries jubilee). So her sensible approach to getting her own freedom is quite delightful, especially since it shows that she doesn't need a man. She has one, though -- and Mendanbar is a good love interest, quirky and pleasant enough. There's also a solid backing cast, including Cimorene's son in the fourth book, the cat-keeping witch Morwen, and the friendly dragon Kazul.<br /><br />Fractured fairy tales, dragon politics and melting wizards can all be found in \\"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles,\\" a charming little quartet of quirky fantasy books.Shiara, a dragon, a lizard, and a rather annoying princess.

But the book it's based on is only a classic because the movie is. You know those books that are so simple you can read them in one afternoon? \\"The Graduate\\" is so simple you could write it in one afternoon.<br />Ben Braddock is the graduate, a young man from a good family who has just finished college. By his family's expectations, he should now go on to a good graduate school and then to a good career. But Ben doesn't really have any ambitions, and isn't sure what he wants to do with his life. He's cynical and depressed, unwilling to go in any one direction.<br />Then he meets Mrs. Robinson, the seductive wife of his father's best friend, and a woman old enough to be his mother.Though Benjamin is initially reluctant, Mrs. Robinson has some idea of what Ben is feeling. She lures him into an affair, which goes very awry when he meets Elaine Robinson, his lover's daughter -- and falls for her.<br />Charles Webb seems to be shooting for a biting, witty look at the stagnated culture of the 1960s, and how that culture turned itself inside out with rapid, bewildering changes in morals and worldviews. The problem is, this book is neither biting nor witty. Some parts of it are amusing, but it's impossible to get into the story. As a social commentary, it makes its point. But as a novel, it's a failure.<br />It's hard to really get into a book when it's written like a screenplay. Unfortunately, Charles Webb's style is less like an author and more like a screenwriter. Minimal description, basic dialogue, and a few bloodless descriptions of the characters' actions; even the sex scenes are ice-cold, almost like a step-by-step \\"how-to\\" guide for seduction. And the lack of insight into what the characters are thinking or feeling makes most of them feel like cardboard cutouts, just types like \\"wealthy sexy woman\\" or \\"disillusioned youth.\\"<br />Some authors are able to take the minimalistic approach and make it work. Webb's writing just seems like he was too bored to include further detail. Ben comes across not as a disillusioned youth, but as a spoiled brat who stalks a girl he won't be interested in for long. Elaine is both boring and rather annoying, as she seems willing to marry anybody who asks. Mrs. Robinson is one of the few characters that has a spark of life to her.<br />Very rarely does a movie outstrip the novel it's based on. But \\"The Graduate\\" is one of those.

Alas, now she has her own fan-oriented biography -- a rather vague background outline, peppered with career information and talk of how great she is.<br />&quot;Woman&quot; follows Shakira from her childhood as a bright, talented child to a burgeoning singing sensation in her native Columbia, then finding instant stardom in the US. Her religion, her family, her boyfriends, and her insights into life (such as when a bag of her songs was stolen) are gone into, but not in-depth.<br />Few biographies of actors or singers who are still alive are any good. However, &quot;Woman&quot; is lacking even among the quickie celebrity biographies. Ximena Diego, a Spanish-language entertainment editor, shoots for a professional look at Shakira, and succeeds in outlining her career, her CDs, her career ups-and-downs, and the festivals and concerts she played at. Unfortunately, there isn't much more to the biography than that.<br />Ximena Diego is a fan of Shakira's, and it shows. We're told frequently how talented, how sweet, how wonderful Shakira is. Why do we need to be told at all? The most frustrating thing is that while Diego has clearly done her research, she fails to balance out Shakira's personal interactions with her professional life. There's hardly anything about her friends or non-music accomplishments.<br />Die-hard Shakira completists may want this, or people who are just finding out about her. But for those who want something of substance about the &quot;woman full of grace,&quot; wait for the next book.	2003-07-30

Mac Randall's &quot;Exit Music: The Radiohead Story&quot; is a solid, informative cache of background info on this band, without being either vindictive or fawning.<br />It charts the group's origins, the guys behind the music, and their rise from an unusually sedate gathering of British guys to a world-famous band with immensely popular music and legions of devoted fans. No tabloidy gossip here -- it's focus on the band and what they do best.<br />The pictures are the main disappointment; they're black and white, and are basically shots of the band members and not much else. Randall is a fan but not a fanboy; his attitude is cool and professional. He offers a basic, informative description of Radiohead's history. As the band members do, there is relatively little info on their early personal lives or love lives, but plenty on their careers and music.<br />It's not earthshattering, but a good source of information and background information. Solid read for Radiohead fans, old and new.	2003-07-29

With that basic concept, Isaac Asimov spun a collection of thought-provoking stories about these robots of the future -- sad ones, shocking ones, funny ones, and more.<br /><br />Told within the framework of a robot-shrink's reminiscences, \\"I, Robot\\" contains several stories: \\"Robbie,\\" about a little girl's robot nursemaid and best friend who is sent away by her shallow, controlling mother. \\"Runaround,\\" in which Gregory Powell and Mike Donovan find themselves in a dangerous situation on Mercury -- with Speedy (SPD), a robot who seems to be drunk.

And \\"The Inevitable Conflict\\" offers a glimpse into the growing influence of machine over man.<br /><br />It's a testament to Isaac Asimov's skill that the stories of \\"I, Robot\\" are still so impressive today, despite having been written from 1940 to 1950. With a variety of futuristic robots and the three laws of Robotics, he offers intriguing looks at politics, ethics, theology, and other concepts. Even stuff like senses of humor and white lies are looked at. If a robot can't harm a human, could it tell a human a truthful answer that would make that human feel bad?

It also, unfortunately, resulted in huge numbers of shameless imitators. Of all these, no fantasy is as horribly imitative as Dennis McKiernan's \\"Iron Tower\\" trilogy. Literally everything in this book is derived somehow from Tolkien's work, and it's so painfully written that reading it is a chore.<br />In the peaceful land of the Boskydells, the tiny Warrows are readying themselves for war against the evil Dark Mage Modru and his hordes of Rucks, Hloks, Ghuls and Ogrus. Tuck Underbank and his teammates arrive at the citadel of Challerain Keep to help the High King, only to be driven out. Only a small band of Elves, Dwarves, Men and Warrows hold the key to defeating Modru and saving the world from eternal darkness.<br /><br />The \\"Iron Tower\\" trilogy is very, very painful to read. McKiernan copies so much from Tolkien that a semi-experienced fan can pick out the elements as they appear. What's more, it's horribly written. The old quest story has been done to death, and so has the band-of-several-races saves the world. In fact, Tolkien's work is one of the few in which it actually DOES work; McKiernan can't manage it, and for some reason features that sort of plot in just about every book he writes.<br /><br />And while McKiernan may say (as he does in the foreword) that he's just homaging Tolkien, I found otherwise. A homage is a nod to someone in an otherwise original book; McKiernan just copies everything. In here you'll find shallower duplicates of Galadriel (dull Elf seer Rael), Frodo (Tuck), Sting (Bane), Legolas (Gildor), Aragorn (Galen), Brega (Gimli), the abandoned Dwarf city of Moria (Kraggen-Cor) complete with its own versions of the Watcher and the Balrog (the kraken and utterly unscary Ghath), hobbits (Warrows), mithril (silveron), Theoden (Aurion), the Rohirrim (Vanadurim) and the Shire (Boskydells). Many secondary elements like the sunken island of Atala, Gyphon and Modru are also derived from Tolkien's extended works. Even a few names (Gildor and Laurelin) are directly lifted. Painful? You bet.<br /><br />McKiernan's writing is even worse. His dialogue is absolutely absurd, full of weird platitudes and bad invented languages. (It doesn't count as an ancient language if you misspell the words!) The Warrows switch accents constantly, sometimes in mid-conversation. Cockney, pirate, formal English, old English, early twentieth-century English, and some that were just weird. After this, I never want to hear \\"Lor,\\" \\"Yar,\\" \\"Ar,\\" or anything else like that. He describes boring travel in intricate detail, so we get pages of the characters just riding from point A to point B. (And note to McKiernan: did we need a detailed description of how Tuck's mom embroiders? Who cares what noise the needle makes?) But battle scenes are plodding and bloodless, and the characters don't stay in any peaceful place for very long.<br /><br />McKiernan's attempts at fleshing out this story achieve nothing. He has about sixty names for every species, building, forest, mountain... you get the idea. (I could not care less what Elves call Dwarf mountains, okay?) There is also a boring series of appendices, timelines, songs, translation keys. But just having a lot of different words for the same things doesn't make Mithgar even slightly interesting.<br /><br />Character development and conflict is nonexistant. The characters don't have any motivations except \\"we're good, we have to save the world\\" or \\"we're evil, we have to destroy it.\\" When they fight, they make up in about a page; they have a tendency to start laughing helplessly like escaped mental patients. And when all else fails, McKiernan falls back on preaching about gender equality and a kidnapped princess. (Does anyone see a contradiction here?) The climax is straight out of a bad horror movie and is the silliest thing I've ever read.<br /><br />The characters are even more annoying: Tuck Underbank (nothing like\\"Underhill,\\" right?) cries incessently and can't make a single decision for himself. Galen is, simply put, boring and pompous. Gildor is the token Elf, also very boring; Brega seems like he might be interesting, but he quickly loses his gruffness and becomes boring too. Danner is a psycho-hobbit who spends the whole book getting offended; Vidron is the most three-dimensional character in the book, but his constant coddling of the annoying Warrows takes away from the idea that this guy is a great general. But the female characters are outright offensive. Merrilee is a whiny twerp who bursts into tears after a battle (why? Because she's a girl) and needs Danner to tell a crowd that she's the equal of a guy. And Laurelin is a sugar-sweet, innocent, golden-haired paragon of virtue who spends the book crying.<br /><br />The feeling coming out of \\"Iron Tower\\" was that McKiernan wanted to rewrite \\"Lord of the Rings\\" as HE thought it should have been written (come on, Frodo does NOT need a girlfriend).

Anne Rice is one of the few authors whose lives and opinions are as interesting as what they write, and Michael Riley offers more insight than virtually any other interviewer has done.<br />Michael Riley was a friend of Stan Rice's, and met Anne Rice at her wedding to Stan; he remained a pal after Anne shot to fame. Yet &quot;I had rarely if ever seen an interview or profile that  I thought did justice to her.&quot; So the two sat down and discussed many things about Rice: Her youth and her Catholic upbringing, about good and evil, New Orleans, California, her mold-breaking fiction, the immensely popular vampire Lestat, the handling of sex in her books, intellectual pretentions and elitism, the movie adaptation of &quot;Interview With The Vampire,&quot; and what in her life inspired aspects of her books.<br />A less respectful reviewer probably would have descended leering or sneering, given that Rice's works include erotica, S&amp;M fiction, and a Lolita-type novel. But Riley is professional, affectionate yet not gushing, and his questions have brains behind them. (Not the usual &quot;what's your favorite food? Do you have any pets?&quot;) His respect for Rice is clear, and it makes the book especially interesting that he has genuine interest in what she says. But of course, the book hinges on Rice and what she has to say to Riley -- whether or not you agree with what she's saying, her warmth and humor are in clear evidence, and she's clearly thought through what she says.<br />It may not be necessary to know the author to enjoy his/her works, but it definitely can't hurt. Fans of Anne Rice will find this a must-read, and even casual readers of her books should give it a shot.	2003-07-19

But his novella &quot;Amsterdam&quot; is something of a misfire, reading more like the sluggishly-filled-out outline for a novel rather than a novel itself. His usual introspection and depth is both missing and sorely missed.<br />Molly Lane is dead, her mind and body wrecked by an unspecified brain disorder. Now her assorted lovers and friends reunite one last time, including Molly's ex-boyfriends Clive and Vernon, respectively a prominent composer and a not-so-respected newspaper editor. Because of Molly, they are friends -- and they enter into a pact because of her death.<br />But things go awry when Vernon gets his hands on photos of the Foreign Secretary Julian Garmony, cross-dressing and photographed by Molly. Eager to bring down Garmony and bring up his readership, Vernon wants to publish the photos in his newspaper; Clive is disgusted by this, yet he allows a rapist and murderer to go free for the sake of his musical inspiration. Which man is worse?<br />&quot;Amsterdam&quot; is like a city in winter, pretty at a distance but rather empty and cold when you walk through it. In theory it has all the elements needed for a great novel, but it feels vaguely unfinished, as if McEwan was expanding an outline into a full-fledged novel but somehow never finished the job. It's too quick in places, crawls like a slug in others.<br />The characters are lacking in the complexity found in most of McEwan's other books, where many dimensions can be found. Clive is almost impossible to connect with; Vernon is more understandable, given his waning career. Garmony is poisonous without it being clear why, and George Lane (Molly's staid husband) seems promising but doesn't go much of anywhere.<br />Aside from the characters, the prose is rather obvious and often lacking in insight: it describes what the characters do, but very little of what they think. As a result, some of the actions -- such as Clive watching a woman being attacked -- seem almost random. It feels half-finished, as if McEwan weren't quite sure how to make the novel come to like. But in places, such as Mrs. Garmony's public speech about her husband and Vernon, his brilliance shines forth.<br />So while an acceptable novel by most standards, it's perhaps the least of McEwan's works thus far. Has its moments of brilliance, but overall dreary and empty.Clive watching a woman being attacked -- seem almost random.

Tolkien has been to Theonering.net, the massive fan website that contains far-reaching news, rumors, info and discussions about Middle-Earth. Now the webmasters of that site have compiled essays, film reviews, much-asked questions into the &quot;People's Guide to J.R.R. Tolkien,&quot; both for and by &quot;the people.&quot; (Meaning the fans)<br />After a foreword by the foremost Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey, the book launches into a series of essays by the very kind Tehanu, Anwyn, Quickbeam, Ostadan, and Turgon. They examine charges of racism and sexism, explore the relationship between Sam and Frodo, defend escapism, study the effects of 9/11 and Tolkien's world, Christianity's indirect impact on Middle-Earth (&quot;Wake up and Smell the Dogma&quot; being one of these), its relationship to Arthurian legend, its mythological roots, analyzing Tolkien's &quot;Letters&quot; book, the real hero of &quot;Rings&quot;, nature's place in Middle-Earth, and many other ideas and concepts.<br />And, in keeping with what's going on now, there is movie analysis. First they handle the ghastly Rankin/Bass film and mediocre Bakshi film. Then they go over the new live-action Peter Jackson trilogy, and the multiple viewpoints on the films themselves are great (Anwyn's is probably the most in-depth). Among the essays is Quickbeam's visit to New Zealand in 2000 where he checked out sets, filming, and actually met Jackson himself (as well as talented actors Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Bernard Hill and Orlando Bloom). The end of one section gives us an unusually sweet, romantic glimpse of Jackson and Fran Walsh. (Too many interviewers treat them just as coworkers, and not as a loving couple with two kids. Both sides can be seen here)<br />That's not to say that it's all serious analysis: There is the &quot;Merchandising Hell&quot; chapter, full of nightmare cash-in merchandise (&quot;lembas&quot; nutrition bars sold at health clubs, Gollum toothpaste), gaming, a C.S. Lewis-inspired &quot;Screwtape&quot; letter, and the reclaiming of the word &quot;geek.&quot; (Geek pride!) Finally there is a Q&amp;A section handling questions like why hobbits aren't inclined to use the Ring's power, or Elf astronomy. (Not to mention the extremely cute &quot;Yes, Elanor, there really is a Gandalf!&quot; letter)<br />The &quot;People's Guide&quot; benefits both from the authors' knowledge of Tolkien, and their knowledge of who they're talking to. The book isn't overly complicated or nitpicky, but it's far from dumbed-down. It's conversational, but instructive. Even people well-acquainted with Tolkien's work may come away with new perspectives on it, and new fans will find insights for the first time.<br />Perhaps one of the best qualities of this book is the sense of familiarity it provides. Readers (assuming they've been to the website) will already be acquainted with the authors. You know they're not going to pull anything deranged out of their hats or show any scholarly contempt; you know they're genuine fans, not just analysts. Oh yes -- they're geeks too, the best kind of fan. (&quot;Are we not geeks?&quot;)<br />Whether you have been a fan for years, or watched the new movies and were hooked, this is a must-read.

Now she's a trust-fund fashionista, with little to do but shop and spend with fellow celebrities and socialites. What's more, she hopes to catch the eye of an obscure European prince, Stephan -- assuming that someone else doesn't snare him. To impress him with her charity and selflessness, she arranges to adopt a Chinese orphan baby, aided by her feisty transsexual pal India, and loyal maid Bannerjee.<br />Until she receives the devastating news: her fund is now empty. What will she do? Marry a rich guy, if she can, and in the meantime must gird her loins and take on a new challenge: getting a job, despite having no skills. Much to the delight of the poisonous top socialite Teeny Van der Hominie, Cat has to vacate her apartment, and takes a position on a blossoming webzine focusing on fashion and the New York nightlife.<br />&quot;Cat's Meow&quot; name-drops almost to a fault (including a cameo by Prince William), and lampoons the rich and shallow who are not required to make anything of their lives. Yet it's hard to tell if the lampooning is wholehearted; near the end the tone toward the lampooned start to look mildly alluring. Sort of, &quot;yeah, I know it's all stupid, but it's still kind of fun.&quot;<br />The writing is pretty fluffy and undetailed, sprinkled with New York fashionista insights about clothes, Botox, ex-boyfriends and special temperature-controlled wardrobes. (I am not making that up) It's amusing at times, assuming that you are not annoyed too much by Cat's bumbling.<br />Cat is essentially a spoiled rich-kid, who is offered a prime position at a major magazine and turns it down because it's too menial; fortunately, De la Cruz keeps her amusing with things like the &quot;Muslim chic&quot; costume or her baby, unfortunately named Boing. She's certainly more likable at the end than at the beginning. Stephan is a Ken doll; Bannerjee is amusing, with her crush on Prince William. But it's India who steals the show as the take-no-guff transsexual best friend.<br />If you're looking for an amusing fluff novel about love, money, celebrity and weirdly-named babies, this might be a nice diversion. These still waters sure don't run deep, but they may make you laugh.who is offered a prime position at a major magazine and turns it down because it's too menial; fortunately, De la Cruz keeps her amusing with things like the &quot;Muslim chic&quot; costume or her baby, unfortunately named Boing.

The story of a strong young wysard is continued, in a quest to save himself, his mentor, and the world from an unspeakable foe.<br />In &quot;Wysard,&quot; Ryel went on a quest to defeat the evil daimon Dagar and to reunite the body and rai (soul) of his mentor Edris. In the twisting path, Ryel saved the lovely Sovrena Diara, and encountered Michael, an acolyte of Dagar. Now Ryel is on the road again, encountering a simpering poet and a tough soldier.<br />But when Ryel cures a man called Redbane of a strange illness, he contracts the illness himself (much to Dagar's delight). And to find the spell he's looking for, Ryel must go into deeper, darker places than he's ever gone before: the Fraternity of the Sword, religious fanatics -- and if he loses his battle with Dagar, he will lose everything.<br />Kephart's fantasy world is a stark, complex one, a bit like Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea, but much grittier, sexier, frightening one. No elves or dwarves, pixies or time travel here. Instead, Kephart takes care to craft a bunch of different cultures, religions, customs and traditions, all well-written and very intriguing to read about.<br />It's possible to get a little lost even if you've read &quot;Wysard&quot; (and you should -- readers who don't will be hopelessly lost if they don't). The plotting is steadier and we have a better glimpse into Ryel's mind as his situation gets worse and worse. The prose flows a little better, as does the dialogue.<br />Ryel is a solid hero, flawed but very likable; Edris pops up from time to time, gruff but a good mentor for Ryel. And Dagar takes the cake as a seemingly indestructible, very gleeful villain; other characters like the Countess and Alleron are good supporting cast. All the characters are distinct and individual, very well-written.<br />&quot;Lord Brother&quot; is a worthy follow-up to &quot;Wysard,&quot; and a treat for those who like their fantasy a little darker and unpredictable. &quot;Lord Brother&quot; is a rare read.and a treat for those who like their fantasy a little darker and unpredictable. &quot;Lord Brother&quot; is a rare read.	2003-07-16

With the advent of the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; It has quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it, set the tone for most fantasy ever since, topped many &quot;best book&quot; polls, and helped spawn such entertainment phenomena as &quot;Star Wars.&quot;<br />Following up on events in &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; stars the quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed: Mount Doom.<br />&quot;The Two Towers&quot; begins directly after &quot;Fellowship,&quot; after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them; his cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs of the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised, the Ring's slave Gollum.<br />&quot;Return of the King&quot; brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.<br />&quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone who has read it. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences, and the mechanization of the countryside for the most moving passages of the book. His beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.<br />Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of how he is influenced by the Ring. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage over the course of the trilogy. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual Obi-Wan Kenobi wizards. Merry and Pippin start out as a chirpy boy and a well-meaning flake, but are matured and made more multi-dimensional by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.<br />Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue ranges from absolutely hilarious to solemn and biblical, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary; if you don't have a good attention span, then you won't be able to handle this story.

Now he expands further, in a darker, grittier, more realistic fantasy set in our world, where a confused young boy has to escape dark forces that want to use him for their own ends -- or kill him.<br />Arthur Penhaligon has asthma. As a result, he ends up in the hospital regularly. But one day he encounters a strange man called Mr. Monday and his creepy butler, who leave him with a Key shaped like a minute hand and a little book with dancing letters. When he returns home after another stay in the hospital, Arthur finds that the Key seems to be attracting unwanted attention -- a statue of a Komodo dragon comes alive, and a winged man-dog tries to come into his house. What's more, a House has appeared -- one that is also inside the little book.<br />Soon Arthur is being pursued by more dog-faced Fetchers, and a strange plague is sweeping his town -- and somehow the Key is keeping him alive, even though he was supposed to die of an asthma attack. His answers lie inside the House. But what lies beyond it is like nothing in our world, where ghastly nithlings roam and the Piper's children run wild in the streets. And the sinister Mr. Monday wants the Key back.<br />Garth Nix takes his focus from high fantasy (such as the Abhorsen trilogy or the Seventh Tower series) to a more modern fantasy that takes place in our world. Though Arthur skips to another world, he's clearly from our own world. But Nix doesn't downplay his brand of horrific fantasy either; stuff that would seem silly for most other authors is magic in his hands.<br />As in his other books, he melds an exceptional, original fantasy world with elements of horror. The handling of the parallel world, the Will, Sneezer, and the Key and Atlas are all wonderfully woven together (not to mention the characters of Dawn, Dusk, Noon for each day, and so on). At the same time, we have the bloodwinged, silver-tongued Noon and the ugly Fetchers, not to mention the hideous nithlings. This is dark fantasy at its best.<br />Arthur is a likable kid, with an unusual problem (asthma). Like most of Nix's heroes, he's desperately running and searching, and learning from those ahead of him. Quirky Suzy is reminiscent of a Lloyd Alexander heroine. The writing is detailed, evocative, and never lags for a minute.<br />&quot;Mister Monday&quot; is another great book from Garth Nix, combining darkness and fantasy and leaving me eagerly awaiting the next book in the series.

Tolkien's Middle-Earth. Unfortunately, a lot of it stinks. The good art is excellent, but plenty is mediocre or just awful, rough-looking futuristic stuff that seems utterly alien to Tolkien's work.<br />John Howe's have the vividity and beauty we expect from him, especially his outstanding picture of Gandalf that inspired the Peter Jackson movie's Gandalf; Alan Lee's are more ethereal and colorless, but still beautiful (especially his Luthien painting). Nasmith's are usually quite good; they're not as good as Howe or Lee, but head and shoulders above average. Goldsmith is fairly good, not exceptional.<br />Michael's Hague's are mediocre, lacking in imagination and sparkle but serviceable. Robert Garland's paintings range between the exquisite (his lovely &quot;Smith&quot; picture) and the cartoonish (his eye-popping &quot;Haven&quot; picture); the same is true of Edelfeldt, who is divided between bad and good. Phenix and Galuidi are just awful, garishly colored and totally unrealistic. Galuidi's Saruman looks like a picture for a D&amp;D game, and his Barad-dur looks like a cheap scifi cover.<br />Each painting is accompanied by a relevant quote or piece of verse, usually an excerpt from the book in question (not just &quot;The Hobbit&quot; or &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; but other books as well). There are some nice bits of artwork in this book, but only buy it if you can't find Nasmith, Lee, Howe or Goldsmith anywhere else.	2003-07-04

But Johnny soon finds that the trolley has more than garbage -- there's a new newspaper dated from decades ago.<br />Before you can say &quot;what the disc!&quot;, Johnny and his friends (dignified Yo-less, wannabe-nerd Bigmac, abrasive Kristy, and not-so-dignified Wobbler) are whisked back in time to 1941. At first they're intrigued by the weirdness of the old place, but things take a nasty turn: Bigmac is arrested, while Wobbler is first harassed by a bratty kid and then accidently left behind. When Johnny and his pals reappear, they soon discover that their brief trip back in time has completely messed up the timeline...<br />This book is more complex than &quot;Johnny and the Dead&quot; and better-written than &quot;Only You Can Save Mankind.&quot; Pratchett's quirky characters, occasional social commentary and funny speculation (the trouser-legs-of-time description is the best time description you can find). The appearance of the elderly Wobbler is a stroke of genius, as is the &quot;... I'm a Muslim&quot; joke that serves an important part of the plot.<br />Pratchett's writing is clearer and quirkier here than before. The storyline is far smoother and more detailed, and he puts in extra scenes that add to the characters (such as Yo-less dealing with a '40s woman's racism) without distracting us from the story. And the funnier scenes (like the police interrogaton, or the &quot;spy!&quot; harrassment) are absolutely hysterical.<br />As before, Johnny is the one really normal person as well as the smartest. Yo-less makes less of an impact unless dealing with stereotypes, and Bigmac makes very little unless being interrogated. The rather self-satisfied Kristy barges undiplomatically at Johnny's side (though she does deal with '40s sexism in a very amusing way), and Wobbler has the subtlest and perhaps most interesting role.<br />&quot;Johnny and the Bomb&quot; incorporates the strengths of the previous two books, finishing it off with a flourish (and lots of explosions). Funny, cute, a time travel story for the thinking reader.absolutely hysterical.<br />As before, Johnny is the one really normal person as well as the smartest.

Harry Potter? No, Timothy Hunter, a comic character that predated the Potter series; Hunter's adventures are darker and more mysterious. Now<br />Timothy Hunter seemed like an ordinary boy, an average boy with a depressed father and a sprightly best friend. But that was until he ran into a strange man called John Constantine. Constantine reveals that Timothy is more than he appears -- he is a powerful mage, perhaps destined to be the most powerful in the world. And he's there to show Timothy the world of magic that he can choose -- if he dares.<br />To show Timothy this, Constantine takes him to the beginning of time, through space to the United States, to the land of Faerie, to one of many possible futures in his own life. He meets Merlin, Baba Yaga, and the queen of Faerie herself. But there are evil forces that want Timothy dead, and will chase him to the end of the universe (literally) to make sure he ends up that way.<br />Jablonski's novelization of the first &quot;Book of Magic&quot; is a competant one, neither excellent nor bad. If you've never read the comics, you'll still understand what's going on, and probably look forward to future adventures involving Timothy, Molly, Zatanna and the rest. Gaiman's dark, sometimes sinister brand of magic is well-translated into the novelization, and he includes a foreword on Jablonski's work.<br />The writing style is pleasant, not very descriptive but gives some good insights to Tim's thoughts. Fortunately, she never goes off-the-wall or out-of-character. The simplicity of the writing wasn't always okay; I had trouble picturing some of the characters (the only real description of Titania is &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;green&quot;). The characterizations are pretty well-done; Timothy in particular is well fleshed-out.<br />Fans of the &quot;Books of Magic&quot; comic series may not bother with &quot;The Invitation,&quot; but it's definitely worth reading for both newcomers and fans.series may not bother with &quot;The Invitation,&quot; but it's definitely worth reading for both newcomers and fans.	2003-06-30

Unfortunately, anyone with an objective viewpoint won't be able to keep a straight face if they read John Granger's exceptionally poorly-written analyzation of the Harry Potter series. Self-congratulatory, lacking in scholarly objectivity and often hysterically funny, this is an insult to the readers' intellects.<br />Granger goes over the top with his analyzation of names, incidents, characters, and so forth. (Rita Skeeter -- wow, how deep that meaning is) Thought that Harry Potter was just a cool wizard character? Wrong -- you'll find Granger desperately digging for ways to set Harry Potter up as a Christian King Arthur figure, more exalted than Aragorn or Caspian, and falling flat on his face time and again. The obvious (snake as force of evil) is mixed with the ridiculous (Lily Potter was a Slytherin student because of her eye color), into a wild mishmash that made me feel vaguely dizzy.<br /><br />Granger spends a great deal of time and effort trying to prove the symbolism and influences of the Harry Potter series. Problem is, he's terrible at it. He cites such animals as stags, pheonixes and gryphons as being symbolic of Christ, yet they had symbolic importance in non-Christian religions as well (the stag was the companion animal of a Celtic god who also had a... snake. So much for that theory). Significant symbolism that has no connection to Christianity is omitted entirely (such as the Grim).<br /><br />His strained interpretations become even sillier when you get to his interpretations of names. \\"Harry Potter\\" is first likened to Shakespeare's Harry Hotspur (oh yeah, I see the resemblance), and then it's claimed that the name is derived from the Cockney pronunciation of \\"heir\\" and a Biblical verse about pottery. Only the truly naive could swallow a double interpretation as strained as that. Farcical Gilderoy Lockhart's name is interpreted as a poke at fellow British fantasy author Philip Pullman (Granger sidesteps precisely how he came to this conclusion). It sounds more like Granger's the one who wants to jab at Pullman.<br /><br />If these aren't enough to put readers off, equating Rowling with C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien may. (His logic seems to be that if she enjoyed Lewis's books, she must write similarly allegorical stories herself) Though Rowling has never even hinted at such, Granger is convinced that her works are consciously, head-bangingly allegorical and he's insistent that even the most insubstantial elements are significant. The problem is, many of them are so disjointed and redundant that it's hard to imagine any author cramming two or three \\"hidden meanings\\" for every character, place, or event in such a huge book series. And the way he goes on about Rowling liking Lewis, Dickens and Austen, you'd think she was the first fan those authors had ever had.<br /><br />What's more, he seems very self-satisfied with his own educational background, not to mention rather congratulatory over basic Latin included in the books. Many fantasy books also include Latin; it's not unusual, exceptional, or even very hard to decipher if you have even the most basic knowledge of linguistic roots. Having a degree in Latin or interest in classic literature is far from exceptional (the University of Chicago is hardly Oxford or Yale), nor does it make him better-equipped to interpret the Potter series. Worst of all, Granger predicted several things about the fifth volume of the Harry Potter books -- all of which are incorrect.<br /><br />There are books out there by less educated and less self-satisfied authors that will give better insights to the Harry Potter series. Unless you're looking for some good nonfiction humor, pass this one by. It's a manic mess that will give the discerning reader a really bad headache.fellow British fantasy author Philip Pullman (Granger sidesteps precisely how he came to this conclusion).

1068511:US	50881246	R1CQSDZ5TMOQM7	1582343586	378018122	Hey Nostradamus!: A Novel (Coupland, Douglas)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Hey!	People really freaked out about school shootings a few years ago, but Douglas Coupland cranks back the dates a little for &quot;Hey Nostradamus!&quot;, his latest satirical, poignant book. It resembles a non-apocalyptic, smoother &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma&quot; in some ways, but stands alone entirely.<br />High-schoolers Jason and Cheryl were secretly married in Vegas; shortly afterward Cheryl told her new husband that she was pregnant. Only hours afterward, she was dead -- gunned down by three outsider classmates who decided to shoot their classmates. Jason kills one of the assassins, but is too late to save Cheryl. Media spin casts him as a possible conspirator, and his manic-religious father brands him a murderer (just before Jason's alcoholic mother hits his dad with a lava lamp).<br />Years later, Jason is still haunted by the death of his pregnant wife (nobody knows that they were married), angry at his rigid father and the hardcore, empty Christian group YouthAlive! that added to his pain. Now he is gradually slipping into a new relationship with a woman named Heather -- one with a difficult secret of her own.<br />The book is split into four sections: the first is Cheryl's, looking back on her life and her death, then at Jason (before, during and after the shootings), then to Heather, and finally to Jason's ultra-religious father Reg. It's a bit reminiscent of Coupland's &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma,&quot; with the teen boy growing to manhood haunted by his lover/wife and child, and the passages by the POW of a dead person, but there the resemblance ends.<br />Coupland touches tricky subjects like religion and school shootings carefully. Though he comes down hard on preachy, gossipy, judgemental types, his beef is not with religion or Christianity so much as people who use it for themselves; at one point, Jason says that his father has a &quot;pagan&quot; mentality that sacrifices everyone else. (After his dad said that one of two identical twin boys didn't have a soul) The YouthAlive people are thoroughly disgusting, but the worst part is that there are actually people like these, vultures and gleeful puritans.<br />Needless to say, the most vivid characters are Jason and Cheryl (even though Cheryl's dead as it ends); Coupland does a good job with feelings of teen desire, frustration and maturation. Heather's a less 3-D character, while Jason's parents are a little different -- his mom rises above the alcoholic cliche, and while Coupland provides greater insight into Reg, I still despised him.<br />It's very much a Douglas Coupland book, very insightful and well-written. Definitely worth reading and thinking about.have a soul) The YouthAlive people are thoroughly disgusting, but the worst part is that there are actually people like these, vultures and gleeful puritans.<br />Needless to say, the most vivid characters are Jason and Cheryl (even though Cheryl's dead as it ends); Coupland does a good job with feelings of teen desire, frustration and maturation.

Patricia McKillip has gained a reputation as one of the few truly original fantasy authors out there. With her exquisitely ethereal prose and haunting stories, she is on top form in \\"In the Forests of Serre.\\" Princes, princesses, witches and wizards, firebirds and black jewels are all spun together by a master.<br />Prince Ronan of Serre lost his wife and child, and now he tries to die by going off to fight in wars for his tyrant father. When returning from a battle, he accidently kills a chicken belonging to the witch Brume; the old woman curses him, but Ronan doesn't take it seriously. Yet when he returns home, his father reveals that he's betrothed Ronan (the only heir) to Princess Sidonie of Dacia, a small but magical kingdom. While Ronan broods about this, he sees a beautiful firebird pass by the castle, and is enspelled by it.<br />Princess Sidonie is no happier about being married off in a barbaric land, but she has to marry Ronan to keep Dacia from being invaded. She travels to Serre with a wizard, and encounters Ronan wandering in the forest without knowing who he is. When she comes to Serre, she finds that her future husband has vanished -- Ronan is searching for the firebird, because he can't find his way home until he gives it to Brume. But things have become more complicated -- because a wizard has taken Ronan's identity...<br />Like all McKillip's books, this novel is deceptively simple and intriguingly written. She uses simple concepts (witch, wizards, scribe, prince, princess, firebird, a country's magic, and talking animals) and spins her unique prose around them. This is not a book for people who like all the usual elements used in the same old way.<br />McKillip's prose is detailed and lush, bringing to mind the best of medieval tapestries and Loreena McKennitt music; when Ronan is in the woods, McKillip describes moths clinging to him, and spiderwebs covering rips in his clothes. The dialogue is more flowing and natural than in some of her other books; the sentences are longer and less flowery. At the same time, her descriptions of things like transformation into a firebird are exquisite.<br />Ronan is a slightly less vivid character at the beginning, compared to his faded mother and half-nuts father; he becomes more interesting as he stops moping and starts obsessing on the firebird. Princess Sidonie is a likable heroine, not gung-ho but very interesting and determined. The wizard Gyre adds an element of mystery to the plot, while the witch Brume will creep you out.<br />Venture into \\"Forests of Serre,\\" where \\"nothing is predictable.\\" It's haunting, beautiful and magical, not just for fans of fantasy.books; the sentences are longer and less flowery.

With a few bonuses (book excerpts and photographs), this is sort of a cliffs' notes to the film. Cute, fluffy, and might be a nice diversion even if you've seen the movie.<br />In the early sixties, when women could vote and have jobs but not win respect, Barbara Novak wrote the controversial feminist manifesto \\"Down With Love.\\" The book urged women to have \\"sex a la carte,\\" relationships without love, and wean themselves onto chocolate instead of men. It turns the dating world upside down and turns Barbara into a feminist icon.<br />Things go wrong when she is supposed to have a business dinner with Catcher Block, an incorrigible man-about-town with a keen interest in stewardesses. After he cancels their business talk three times, Barbara disses him on a talk show. Catcher's revenge: Make Barbara abandon her own principles and fall in love with him.<br />This novelization is a cute enough retelling, although the warring viewpoints grated on me after awhile. The writing is very plain-vanilla, with very few details included; it's best suited to those who have seen the movies and have a clear idea of what the characters look like. Sometimes the cuteness of the first-person narrative works (the final chapter), and sometimes it doesn't (the phone marriage proposal, which is simply silly).<br />It wouldn't be worth buying if it weren't for the bonuses: an array of behind-the-scenes photos in the middle of the book, featuring more commentary on the clothes than the actual actors (admittedly, the clothes are gorgeous). Then there's a humorous few chapters from \\"Down With Love\\" (\\"You've got to do what men do, and put yourself first.\\") And finally, Catcher's expose on Barbara, very funny and more than a bit self-serving.<br />If you liked the movie then this might be a nice companion piece. At the very least, it's cute and has some photographs worth looking at. (Nice shot with the space helmets)he space helmets)	2003-06-17

If you like mysteries in general, and murder mysteries in particular, then \\"Feet of Clay\\" is an offbeat story that you might just enjoy.<br />First a priest is murdered, and found with a slip of paper in his mouth. Then a curator. And Vimes has no idea how this is happening, or why anyone would kill a couple of harmless old men. To make things worse, he learns that the extremely un-royal Corporal Nobby Nobbs may be the rightful king of Ankh-Morpork (if that doesn't warp your view of reality, nothing will), and that the Patrician is being slowly poisoned -- but no one knows just how the poison is being administered.<br />The answer to the mysteries may lie in the golems: Not-living-but-not-dead creatures made out of clay, who don't speak and always follow orders. Theoretically they can't kill . But they come under suspicion when, inexplicably, they start destroying themselves as the evidence starts to point toward a golem murderer. However, Vimes soon learns that the conspiracy is far more extensive -- and sinister -- than the golems...<br />\\"Feet of Clay\\" is not merely a murder mystery (although it has one of the coolest ways of murdering a person that I've ever heard of). Pratchett also offers some commentary on society, on what makes a person a person. His handling of the golems is remarkably thought-provoking. And their connection to the attempted murder is also very hard to unravel -- you won't guess who or how or why.<br />This is, in some ways, more serious at times than his other books; one scene has Vimes exploding over the death of a little child and a cleaning lady. But don't think he's abandond his skewed brand of Discworld humor: the rebelling dwarf, the unsuccessful assassination at the beginning, Nobby's outrageous behavior and seven grandmothes, and especially a vampire with self-destructive tendencies (sunglasses tester, garlic stacker, pencil factory worker, holy water supplier). Not to mention the organizer with the little imp inside.<br />As always, Vimes is the hard-boiled scrap of sanity among the weirder characters. Angua is, unfortunately, much flatter than the weirder characters; Carrot is his usual likable self, while Nobby gets to act more bizarrely than usual as he is accepted into the upper crust as an aristocrat (a thieving, unsanitary one). Detritus is a likable clod, and we get a new character in Cheery Littlebottom, a dwarf female who wants to start looking like one. And Pratchett outdoes himself with Dorfl, a secretive golem who never speaks or changes expression.<br />While not Pratchett's best, \\"Feet of Clay\\" is a solid mystery/fantasy/commentary with plenty of humor and suspense.

The most flagrantly derivative fantasy trilogy out there limps to a silly climax in \\"Darkest Day,\\" a sad ending to an unworthy trilogy. (And, alas, the beginning of an equally unworthy series)<br />The Boskydells have been freed from Modru's Horde by the High King's armies. Tuck and Merrilee are reunited just as the armies start off to the land of Gron, where the evil Modru is planning to yank back the even more evil Gyphon from the void to which he's been banished. And wimpy Princess Laurelin is somehow a part of his evil malevolent plot. So Warrow Tuck Underbank must somehow save the world, armed only with a prophecy and a little red arrow.<br /><br />The main positive thing that can be said about \\"Darkest Day\\" is that the all-too-similar elements are toned down a little. What's there is essentially the same as before, with the dull Elf seers, tough-wannabe hobbit clones, gruff Dwarves, and a thousand other little elements. There's not much that's new. Unfortunately, what McKiernan puts in instead is even worse.<br /><br />Lacking a ring or a Mount Doom, he creates a climactic human sacrifice scene that wouldn't be out of place in a third-rate horror sequel. Modru's motives for kidnapping Laurelin are revealed, and boy are they stupid. The epic final clash is nothing more than background noise, and the characters become thinner and whinier as their numbers increase. As the final insult, McKiernan includes some shortish appendices and timelines, in the manner of Tolkien's \\"Return of the King.\\" Including these fails completely to give the trilogy any depth.<br /><br />The writing, while not quite as atrocious as it was in the first book, is still bland and obsessed with details that nobody could care less about. Dialogue is mind-blowingly trite, with the heroes speaking as if in the throes of manic, wild emotion; McKiernan is even subtle enough to have the villain Modru hiss when he talks. And while I love a well-written love story in any kind of book, the relationship between Merrilee and Tuck is so hideously sweet that it will make your teeth ache.<br /><br />The weepily ineffective Tuck remains ineffectual and inexplicably liked by everyone; McKiernan injures him badly, apparently thinking that readers will sympathize. Psycho-Warrow Danner's storyline is concluded in a very theatrical manner. Galen, Gildor the Elf and Brega the Dwarf are still bland and uninteresting, as they have the same personality. And the insultingly weak Laurelin cries, whimpers and whines her way until somebody gets around to rescuing her. The stupidity of Modru's motives takes away any shreds of interest I had in him.<br /><br />Written in a style to make Tolkien fans whimper and English majors grow dizzy, \\"Darkest Day\\" is a fittingly limp finale to a dull, derivative trilogy.n Modru hiss when he talks.

In \\"The Boggart\\" she goes into related but different territory, loosing an ancient Scottish spirit on a modern family. Often cute and very interestingly written.<br />The boggart has lived in a decayed Scottish castle for centuries, making harmless mischief and shapeshifting into different forms. But when the elderly caretaker dies, the castle is inherited by the Volnik family, modern Canadians who don't know about the boggart. They arrive in Scotland to check out their rather decrepit property; the boggart decides to take a nap inside a rolltop desk... right before the desk is shipped back to Toronto.<br />When the desk arrives, the boggart makes the most of his situation by wreaking havoc with the electricity, furniture, non-Scottish foods like pizza, and eventually with traffic. His tricks, though not malicious, can quickly spin out of control and become dangerous. But eventually he wants to go home, communicating with Emily and Jess through the computer. Unfortunately, it's not so easy to get a boggart back to Scotland -- especially when the adults believe the boggart is nonexistant, and an obnoxious parapsychologist is sniffing around.<br />Until relatively recently, few people knew about the mythical boggart (similar to the bogle). Cooper saves this book from being a typical story of a mythical creature wreaking havoc in the real world by using a little-known Celtic spirit; the result is that the boggart is charming and likable, almost childlike in its mischief, delight over electricity, and quickly-forgotten emotions. The best parts of the book are the ones from the boggart's point of view, such as its memory of a Scottish chieftain who died long ago.<br />\\"The Boggart\\" is a slightly less sparkling book than the \\"Dark is Rising\\" books, mostly because her prose is plainer and less detailed here. It only really blossoms when we head to Scotland, the sort of ancient atmospheric surroundings that Cooper seems most comfortable writing.<br />The boggart, the star, is likably mischievous; Cooper manages to make it inhuman at the same time. It never thinks or acts like a human. Emily and Jessup are likable characters, with distinct personalities. Supporting characters like the parents or the actors are well-fleshed out, never acting like idiots if they don't know about the boggart.<br />A unique mix of folklore and modern technology. This book could have been so very mediocre, but instead it's a funny, intriguing fantasy.

But when he ventured into the void beyond life, he encountered the daimon Dagar -- who murdered Edris. Now he leaves Markul, with a strange mocking voice in his head and visions of his dying mother and a mad princess.<br />After healing his mother, Ryel travels to the city of Almancar, where the<br />Sovrena Diara has gone mad under Dagar's influence -- the same influence that whispers constantly in Ryel's mind. Even as he heals her, he learns two things: That Edris's rai (spirit) is still around, and can be reunited with his body... and that an evil wysard is trying to bring Dagar back with the same spell...<br />\\"Wysard\\" reads a bit like an earthier, sexier \\"Wizard of Earthsea\\"; it has some of the same themes, the same atmosphere, and one can imagine Le Guin using similar ideas (the misty, ascetic wysard city, the decadent Almancar with its incestuous royals and rich brothels, the proud horse-riding Steppes folk). Kephart manages to deal with Ryel's training quite well through flashbacks, more skillfully than most authors can.<br />Perhaps the biggest problem is that the pace is a little rushed; if it had been slower, it would have been easier to get acquainted with Ryel, Edris and the rest rather than paying attention to where the plot was going next. And readers may be frustrated by the big blinking \\"To Be Continued\\" that ends the book, leading up to sequel \\"Lord Brother.\\"<br />Ryel is a likable guy, and his loving but tense relationship with Edris is exceptionally well-done; Edris himself is a bit abrasive, definitely not easygoing, and a good change from the usual wizard mentors.  The voice of Dagar is mocking and nasty, more effective than a blustering villain.

But his lesser-known profession was that of an professor and linguist, working at Oxford for over three decade. These three translated poems are excellent examples of his non-Middle-Earth work.<br />\\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\\" is a relatively little-known Arthurian legend, in which the knight Sir Gawain must forfeit his life to a knight who allowed Gawain to behead him -- then picked up his head and rode out. \\"Pearl\\" is a beautifully written, though somewhat more difficult to read, poem that chronicles the death of a child (possibly allegorical). \\"Sir Orfeo\\" is a version of the classic myth of Orpheus and Eurydice.<br />Tolkien's method for these works is unusually readable -- most translators sacrifice either readability or meaning; as far as I can tell, Tolkien sacrificed neither. \\"Sir Gawain\\" is probably the easiest translation I have come across; \\"Pearl\\" is haunting, laced with religious references, and very beautifully written; \\"Orfeo\\" is not so substantial as the first two, but still entertaining. It's a bit like a medieval ballad.<br />This book is not so much for fans of Middle-Earth, as for fans of all Tolkien's works. Beautifully written, highly recommended.	2003-06-08

No Potter-clone here -- the second book \\"Curse of Arkady\\" is a solid, entrancingly mysterious fantasy for all ages.<br />Jason Adrian, home from Camp Ravenwyng, is having more disturbing dreams -- about a sinister figure in an old house. When he wakes, he finds a message warning him about the \\"Curse of Arkady.\\" All but a handful of the Magicker students have been dismissed and memory-wiped, and the remaining kids are keeping in touch through their crystals and the Web, trying to keep their identities a secret -- which is becoming more and more difficult.<br /><br />As Gavan tries to get a special Magicker Academy approved by other Magickers, the kids begin to suspect that something bad is coming -- the Dark Hand, a group of evil ex-Magickers. A sinister new therapist has arrived and has a particular interest in Jason; wolfjackals are circling around. And when Jason follows his stepfather to a construction site, he uncovers the secret of the Dark Hand -- and the evil sorcerer Brennard.<br /><br />Though lower-profile than the Harry Potter series, the \\"Magickers\\" books may well be the stronger fantasy series: They are more descriptive, more instrospective, the created world is more complex and serious-minded, the adult characters are capable and pivotal, and it explores the out-of-school time as well. And Drake isn't afraid to sprinkle homages to Star Wars, the Matrix, \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the Potter series itself. And the second book of the \\"Magickers\\" series proves that the first was not a fluke (though you won't understand the second unless you've read the first).<br /><br />Drake's writing is still detailed and action-packed, and she juggles the multiple storylines like an expert. Nothing is dumbed down (as shown by the faked master's degree). Her eye for detail is very present as she shows seemingly insignificant clues from Book 1 to be important plot devices. And fans of the first book will be pleased to see one character return, who had seemingly gone.<br /><br />This book is a little more humorous than the first, with incidents like Stefan turning into a bear just before a football game, or the teacher's face appearing in a soccer ball. On the other hand (no pun intended), the sight of the Dark Hand encroaching on ordinary suburban homes is even more sinister, right up to the shatteringly well-written climax.<br /><br />Jason is a solid lead character, an ordinary kid called on to do extraordinary things yet unsure what to do about them. Tomboyish Bailey is given a little more dimension and brains in this book. Trent continues struggling to keep up with the other Magickers; Brennard finally makes his appearance, and his charming facade just covers his nastiness. His attempts to lure Jason to the Dark Hand are just what you would expect from this guy.<br /><br />\\"Dragon Guard,\\" the next Magickers book, will premiere just as readers have glutted themselves on the fifth Potter book.

It also, unfortunately, resulted in huge numbers of shameless imitators. Of all these, no fantasy is as horribly imitative as Dennis McKiernan's \\"Iron Tower\\" trilogy. Literally everything in this book is derived somehow from Tolkien's work, and it's so painfully written that reading it is a chore.<br />In the peaceful land of the Boskydells, the tiny Warrows are readying themselves for war against the evil Dark Mage Modru and his hordes of Rucks, Hloks, Ghuls and Ogrus. Tuck Underbank and his teammates arrive at the citadel of Challerain Keep to help the High King, only to be driven out. Only a small band of Elves, Dwarves, Men and Warrows hold the key to defeating Modru and saving the world from eternal darkness.<br /><br />The \\"Iron Tower\\" trilogy is very painful to read: McKiernan copies so much from Tolkien that an experienced fan can pick out the elements as they appear. What's more, it's horribly written. The old quest story has been done to death, and so has the band-of-several-races saves the world. In fact, Tolkien's work is one of the few in which it actually DOES work; McKiernan can't manage it, and therefore features that sort of plot in just about every book he writes.<br /><br />And while McKiernan may say (as he does in the foreword) that he's just homaging Tolkien, I found otherwise. A homage is a nod to someone in an otherwise original book; McKiernan just copies everything. In here you'll find shallower duplicates of Galadriel (dull Elf seer Rael), Frodo (Tuck), Sting (Bane), Legolas (Gildor), Aragorn (Galen), Brega (Gimli), the abandoned Dwarf city of Moria (Kraggen-Cor) complete with its own versions of the Watcher and the Balrog (the kraken and utterly unscary Ghath), hobbits (Warrows), mithril (silveron), Theoden (Aurion), the Rohirrim (Vanadurim) and the Shire (Boskydells). Many secondary elements like the sunken island of Atala, Gyphon and Modru are also derived from Tolkien's extended works. Even a few names (Gildor and Laurelin) are directly lifted. Painful? You bet.<br /><br />McKiernan's writing is even worse. His dialogue is absolutely absurd, full of weird platitudes and bad invented languages. (It doesn't count as an ancient language if you misspell the words!) The Warrows switch accents constantly, sometimes in mid-conversation. Cockney, pirate, formal English, old English, early twentieth-century English, and some that were just weird. After this, I never want to hear \\"Lor,\\" \\"Yar,\\" \\"Ar,\\" or anything else like that. He describes boring travel in intricate detail, so we get pages of the characters just riding from point A to point B. (And note to McKiernan: did we need a detailed description of how Tuck's mom embroiders? Who cares what noise the needle makes?) But battle scenes are plodding and bloodless, and the characters don't stay in any peaceful place for very long.<br /><br />McKiernan's attempts at fleshing out this story achieve nothing. He has about sixty names for every species, building, forest, mountain... you get the idea. (I could not care less what Elves call Dwarf mountains, okay?) There is also a boring series of appendices, timelines, songs, translation keys. But just having a lot of different words for the same things doesn't make Mithgar even slightly interesting.<br /><br />Character development and conflict is nonexistant. The characters don't have any motivations except \\"we're good, we have to save the world\\" or \\"we're evil, we have to destroy it.\\" When they fight, they make up in about a page; they have a tendency to start laughing helplessly like escaped mental patients. And when all else fails, McKiernan falls back on preaching about gender equality and a kidnapped princess. (Does anyone see a contradiction here?) The climax is straight out of a bad horror movie and is the silliest thing I've ever read.<br /><br />The characters are even more annoying: Tuck Underbank (nothing like \\"Underhill,\\" right?) cries incessently and can't make a single decision for himself. Galen is, simply put, boring and pompous. Gildor is the token Elf, also very boring; Brega seems like he might be interesting, but he quickly loses his gruffness and becomes boring too. Danner is a psycho-hobbit who spends the whole book getting offended; Vidron is the most three-dimensional character in the book, but his constant coddling of the annoying Warrows takes away from the idea that this guy is a great general. But the female characters are outright offensive. Merrilee is a whiny twerp who bursts into tears after a battle (why? Because she's a girl) and needs Danner to tell a crowd that she's the equal of a guy. And Laurelin is a sugar-sweet, innocent, golden-haired paragon of virtue who spends the book crying.<br /><br />The feeling coming out of \\"Iron Tower\\" was that McKiernan wanted to rewrite \\"Lord of the Rings\\" as HE thought it should have been written (come on, Frodo does NOT need a girlfriend). But his attempt is a dismal failure.ion for himself. Galen is, simply put, boring and pompous.

It's weird, it's wacky, and when you pare it down it's pretty close to anyone else's family life. And that includes dogs peeing on the furniture, music, thongs, the arrogance of big sisters, getting tattoos, and much more.<br />\\"Officially Osbourne\\" is an episode guide (first season) interspersed with biographies, interviews, and information. Each of the bios includes favorite music, birth date, video games, personal philosophies, what their family members say about them, and then an interview. Each episode has a basic summary (about two or three paragraphs) and a slew of pictures. Also there are best lines (\\"Bubbles? Oh come on, Sharon! I'm the Prince of #$&*in' Darkness!\\"), and highlights (a fire in the kitchen -- \\"the first one in the new house\\").<br />There are chapters on other topics too: On Melinda Verga, a lower-key employee, on home decor (black, antiques, and crucifixes), the different rooms in the house, and on the pets (dogs and cats, most memorably Lola). One chapter is devoted to Ozzy and Sharon's parenting methods, and what their kids think of those methods. And most tantalizing of all is the chapter where they talk about what never made it onto your TV screen...<br />This book captures some of the spirit that infuses the Osbourne TV show. The coverage and interviews with Ozzy, smart wife Sharon and kids Jack and Kelly (Aimee declined to be in the show). Their attitudes are refreshingly honest and open -- in a celebrity subculture where people say prescripted, inoffensive lines, the Osbournes will tell the world what they do and don't like (Kelly hates pop singers, for example).<br />The pages are likably colorful, not just black text on white paper. The pictures are a slightly more mixed bag -- there are a lot of them on almost every page in the book, of everyone: The house, the furnishings, the dogs... unfortunately, many are too small to look at easily, and some are blurred. Many are quite good, clear and well-lit.<br />\\"We're not the #$&*ing Partridge Family\\" -- Sharon said it best.

Now with \\"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents\\" Pratchett expands Discworld from adult fantasy to young adult fantasy as well.<br />A boy, a cat, and a troupe of rats arrive at the town of Bad Blintz. But while Keith is normal, feline Maurice and his \\"educated rodents\\" are not -- they speak, think, and are self-aware (they ate wizards' garbage). And they have a nice racket going, where the rats pretend to infest a town (they gnaw things and \\"widdle\\" on the flour), and Keith poses as a piper to lead them away. But something is wrong with Bad Blintz -- there are no native rats, yet the rat-catchers claim that there's an outright plague of them, and are producing rat-tails to prove it. (They bear a remarkable resemblance to shoelaces)<br />With the help of a too-imaginative-for-her-own good girl, Malicia, Keith and Maurice begin to investigate why all the rats are gone, and what the rat-catchers are up to. But  when they discover the conspiracy, Maurice starts hearing the voice of something down in the sewers -- something evil, something powerful, something that can command hundreds of rats...<br />So help me, I'm an idiot where funny titles are concerned, and \\"Amazing Maurice\\" is further proof that they often c. Much as he gave a new spin to MacBeth in \\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" here he gives a new spin to the \\"Pied Piper\\" legend, with some interesting philosophy and his trademarked humor as well. Does the idea of talking animals and preteens make you cringe? Don't -- Pratchett handles it with rare style.<br />There's plenty of humor in this book, from the names of the rats (Dangerous Beans, Additives, Big Savings, Toxie) to Sardines, the tap-dancing rat with a hat to the incident with the laxatives. His dialogue is still brilliant. (\\"Think of my dear wife and my four lovely children who'll be without their daddy!\\" \\"You're not married. You don't have any children!\\" \\"I might want some day!\\")<br />But Pratchett doesn't forget the deeper currents either -- the sense of evil he builds up is very genuine, and Spider is one of the most unique fantasy villains he's created. Also good is the attitude of the Changed rats: they cherish their greater intelligence, fear their instincts, and gradually we see them overcome some of those ratty instincts (rather than eating one of their dead, they bury him like humans do).<br />Keith is a nice character, seeming dim  but surprisingly intelligent; Malicia is a pain in the butt, and only seems to gain any brains near the end. Maurice is the character that Pratchett does best -- he seems, initially, to have no good characteristis, but he's a good person underneath. (With a dirty little secret involving one of the rats) The Educated Rodents are all given individual personalities that Pratchett juggles very well. And Dangerous Beans, a little blind rat, has one of the best scenes in which he confronts the mysterious Spider.<br />\\"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents\\" isn't actually that different from Pratchett's adult fantasies, and older fans of that series will enjoy this one just as much as the kids.

Morley's biography is well-written and informative, but somehow lacks a certain spark.<br />It follows Gielgud from his childhood (from a family with several respected actors) to his early acting career, ascending from a skinny-legged boy to a much-respected actor, and then a knight and universally revered thespian. His arrest for soliciting a plainclothes policeman resulted in a reworking of laws on homosexuality. And he left behind an astonishing body of work, from a quiet man whose life essentially revolved around his work.<br />One of the unusual aspects of \\"John Gielgud: The Authorized Biography\\" is the respect that Morley has for Gielgud. He keeps his tone constantly respectful but not fannish. His handling of potentially sordid situations (the soliciting case) is always careful and respectful, a rarity in most biographies. His handling of Gielgud's homosexuality and its place in 1940s and 1950s England is particularly good. The attitude there and then was quite different from now. Some of the best actors today -- Ian McKellen being the most prominent -- are able to be openly gay, but then it was actually illegal. Morley does a good job describing the social and legal atmosphere at that time, through conversations, letters to the editors, the press's response, and the changes in the law. One slightly frustrating aspect of the book is the lack of presence of the Gielgud family -- when one of them popped back into the narrative, I found myself wondering, \\"Who is that again?\\"<br />Morley also offers insights into British theater and actors, including Gielgud's connections with Vivien Leigh, Lawrence Olivier, Ralph Richardson and Noel Coward. We get to hear the good and bad reviews, some from Gielgud himself, such as his disgust with his shoeless \\"Romeo\\" costume (though the picture of him in that play isn't bad). And (wow, another rarity) Morley lets us see some examples of Gielgud's undeniable wit. Though he seems to have put his foot in his mouth frequently, he had some great zingers: at one point he complained about a flatulent crew member by saying that he didn't mind dying, but must it be in a gas chamber?<br />What is lacking? Perhaps it's a greater sense of knowledge about what made Gielgud tick. Morley knew him, but he fails overall to really let the readers really know what he was like. I got bits and pieces of his personality -- his shyness, his wit, his intense love of acting -- but not a picture of the whole. Some of the dates and situations seem unreliable or debatable. That, and I found the pictures a little unsatisfying. I like it when professional and personal photos are balanced out; this book had almost entirely professional pics.<br />Gielgud was part of a golden generation of great actors, and had a certain quality that filled whatever stage or screen he was on.

While Crossley-Holland has clearly researched the historic details thoroughly, there doesn't seem to be much soul behind the actual narrative.<br />As Arthur found out more about his past, his life has gotten more complex. He's learned who his father is (the fierce Sir William), has learned that his now-ex-betrothed is his half sister and is a squire to Sir Stephen. He also still has the ability to see the life of Arthur of Camelot, whose life somehow (don't ask me how) reflects Arthur of Caldicot's. And he doesn't know who his unknown mother was.<br /><br />As it is a medieval era, Arthur follows Sir Stephen to the Crusades while he continues to search for his mom's identity, while watching the ancient king who is him -- and not him. And as he goes to Champagne and then back to Britain, he comes closer to the truth about the connection between Arthur de Caldicot and Arthur in the stone...<br /><br />Arthurian fiction has been around for a long time, and many readers have a particular affection for it. But, within the framework of another, different story, it just doesn't work. It worked better in \\"Seeing Stone,\\" but in \\"At the Crossing-Places\\" nothing much happens to Arthur de Caldicot. Things happen, sure, but not very fast. Most of the focus is on King Arthur. And while that isn't really a problem in other books, it's a little frustrating to see things through Arthur de Caldicot's eyes, and not get a strong sense of what's happening in his own life.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Crossley-Holland's writing hasn't improved much either. It's still very bare-bones, almost like a play. The narrative improves when the focus is on the past, or when something really spectacular happens. The rest of the time, it's just rather boring. (Especially when dealing with Arthur's romantic involvements -- he has no chemistry with Winnie at all)<br /><br />Arthur is a rather flat lead character, who serves more as a window to the plot than an actual character. Winnie is also quite two-dimensional, but Sir Stephen is a likable enough guy. Unfortunately, Merlin is pretty much absent except through the seeing-stone, and it's hard to get a sense for Arthur and Gawain and the rest. It's like reading a book about someone watching a TV show -- I got little, if any, connection to the Arthurian people.<br /><br />\\"At the Crossing-Places,\\" like \\"Seeing Stone,\\" had potential that never gets realized.

But Merlin's powers aren't quite what they could be. And their peace is shattered by a vision of the Dagda, in which he warns Merlin that the battle against Rhita Gawr is about to come to a head. Dagda can't attack Rhita Gawr directly without unbalancing the world, and so it's up to a wizard -- Merlin -- to rally Fincayra's weird and wonderful array of races against Rhita Gawr.<br /><br />Merlin meets up with his old friend Shim the Giant, and receives terrible news: His father, the evil Stangmar, has escaped his prison and is going after Merlin's mother Elen of the Sapphire Eyes. To make things worse, a sinister masked man with swords instead of arms is killing children -- and Merlin's spells don't work against him.

With her use of myth and folklore, rich language, and a time-spanning battle between good and evil, this is an outstanding example of the fantasy genre.<br />\\"Over Sea Under Stone\\" features the three Drew children coming to stay with Merriman Lyon. In his attic, they find an ancient treasure map that leads to a hidden grail -- if they can only figure out what the map's writing and symbols mean. But they are not the only ones who are looking for the grail -- three sinister people are in pursuit.<br />\\"The Dark is Rising\\" shifts its focus elsewhere. On his eleventh birthday, young Will Stanton encounters the mysterious Merriman, and is told that he is the last of the immortal \\"Old Ones\\" who are fighting the forces of evil (known as the Dark). As the power of the Dark grows, Will must gather the six Signs that can help stop them -- and protect his friends and family from the Dark.<br />\\"Greenwitch\\" brings the four young heroes together. Will and the three Drew kids are brought to Cornwall, where the grail has been stolen. Jane is haunted by nightmares about the Greenwitch, a symbolic weaving of branches and leaves cast into the sea, and a sinister artist captures Barney. But the Greenwitch is not just a tangle of sticks -- it's alive with wild magic that neither Old Ones nor the Dark can control.<br />\\"Grey King\\" is the threat of the Dark. Will is recovering from a bad sickness in Wales, where he meets a \\"raven boy\\" (an albino Welsh boy, Bran ) and a dog with \\"eyes that see the wind.\\" Will must lead Bran into a closer connection with the Old Ones. But when an accident befalls the dog, Bran is angry with the Old Ones -- until the truth of his past comes to light.<br />\\"Silver on the Tree\\" brings the series to a climax. Will receives visions of the past, and a message from Merriman that the final battle between the Dark and the Light is about to come. Evil creatures (minks, specifically) are swarming near his house -- and the Old Ones, while almost ready, don't have the power of the Lady. He teams up with the Drews and with Bran to find the Lost Land.<br />Cooper's writing is detailed and atmospheric (although the first book is much more plainly written than the following four). She can switch instantly from lighthearted to mystical and back again, and her writing is heavy with details and description. And she takes the folklore and legends of Britain and interweaves them with Arthurian legend, giving the whole Arthurian story a new spin. Simply put, beautifully written. It's only one of the things that will make this series as much of a pleasure for adults as for kids.<br />While some may not like the portrayal of good and evil as evenly matched, the strength of the Old Ones' determination is extremely invigorating. They're powerful, but still very human. And there are lessons carefully interwoven about good and evil, about loyalty, compassion, redemption, and friendship. These sentiments are never gooey, just powerful.<br />The characters are overall quite good. Jane, Barney and Simon Drew are a little less endearing because they seem a little dated and similar. Will Stanton, however, has the sparkling quality of a truly classic character, a mixture of a wise ancient being and a preteen boy. Bran, as the heir of Arthur, is a fantastic accompaniment to Will. And Merriman looms over it all as the all-seeing Merriman, alternately forbidding and dignified or kindly and grandfatherly.<br />If you've just finished \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and are searching for something of substance and weight (not as much as Tolkien's, but in the top five), then the Dark is Rising Sequence may be what you're looking for.

While it's not the best I've read, it is a solid adventure story, quite well-written, with likable characters and a good, suspenseful storyline.<br />Prosper and Bo have run away to Venice, escaping a vicious aunt who wants to adopt only Bo. Now, they have joined up with Scipio the Thief Lord, a wily kid of their own age with a mystery identity and a band of loyal street kids, including Hornet, Riccio and Mosca. Though Prosper doesn't like stealing, he has no choice; he has to look out for his little brother, and somehow keep out of sight.<br />Their aunt, however, has hired a private detective (who is preoccupied with turtles) who is trailing the boys through Venice. A nasty merchant named Barbarossa has offered the Thief Lord a massive job on behalf of a mystery client. And the detective starts to home in on the two boys, as the true identity of the Thief Lord comes to light...<br />\\"Thief Lord\\" isn't particularly groundbreaking, but it has a slightly classic feel to it. The settings in Venice, the names of the characters (Prospero, Scipio) and the dramatic details like Scipio's costume. But Funke balances it out with funnier things like Barbarossa's ride on the carousel and Victor's preoccupation with his pets. The magical element of the carousel (shades of Ray Bradbury?) seems a bit out of place, however, as there hadn't been any magic up until then.<br />The writing is quite detailed and descriptive, and Funke doesn't skimp on the descriptions of how gorgeous Venice is. What's more, the translation is, as far as I can tell (which isn't far since I don't speak German), pretty flawless. If I didn't know better I would think that it was originally written in English. It doesn't have quite the sparkle of other authors like Tolkien or Diana Wynne-Jones, but it moves steadily.<br />Funke managed something pretty impressive in her little band of outlaws: teens and preteens fending for themselves are almost never portrayed well, but she manages it. Prosper is a likable lead character, with a lot of doubts and worries but overcoming them for his little brother; Scipio seems a little too mature, but that's okay. Victor and the street kids are strong supporting characters as well.<br />Cornelia Funke's book (along with the movie \\"Heaven\\") is one of the best things to come out of Germany in recent years. Very nice and a pleasant read.teens and preteens fending for themselves are almost never portrayed well, but she manages it.

Adapted from a story by Rudyard Kipling and now reprinted for a juvenile crowd by Starscape Books, \\"Billion-Dollar Boy\\"  is solid if unamazing SF journey.<br />It's the future, when Earth is impoverished except for a tiny number of corporate big-shots. And Cheever heir Shelby has everything a boy could want and more: insane amounts of money, a staff to wait hand and foot on him, and a dimbulb mother who lacks the brains to tell him \\"no\\" sometimes. In short, he's spoiled rotten. And when he wants to take a space cruise, his mum says yes. Unfortunately, Shelby gets drunk on the voyage, and decides to take a small jaunt OUTSIDE the spaceship -- where he gets literally lost in space.<br />Fortunately, he's picked up by a mining vessel. Unfortunately (depending on your viewpoint) the family on board has never heard of the Cheevers, and they certainly don't believe that he's wealthier than all the miners put together. So for the first time, Shelby is forced to use his brain and his body, and pitch in on actual work. That would be fine -- until someone recognizes him, and plans a ransom demand to his father.<br />Like \\"Putting Up Roots,\\" this book is not an amazing, groundbreaking piece of SF, but it's readable for both adults and kids. It has a pretty simple, straightforward plot: Go from A to B, where C will happen. And Sheffield does a good job of shifting Shelby from a bratty, overweight, obnoxious teenage boy to someone resourceful, skilled, and if not smart, then at least trying to be. The writing is fairly ordinary, with some good descriptions of life on a gritty mining ship.<br />This novel is far from flawless, though. One of the biggest problems is the technobabble that the characters launch into, or the idea that Shelby's smart \\"salt of the earth\\" dad would marry an idiot socialite and let his son run wild. Or, for that matter, how there could be a mere few hundred rich elite on Earth; why this is so is never explained, since that sort of scenario wouldn't last long.<br />Shelby is a pleasant oasis in a sea of kid characters who either know it all, or are just plain annoying. He's meant to be annoying, and the means by which he STOPS being annoying is what makes him interesting. Grace is a pretty good character, although I had trouble figuring out if she was a love interest or not. Most of the supporting characters are okay, not stellar, except for the dryly amusing Logan (a robot).<br />Despite the odd implausible points, \\"Billion-Dollar Boy\\" is a solid enough read, with a very flawed lead and a solid, action-filled story.

But more of these are good than you'd think. \\"Midnight for Charlie Bone,\\" while not the best, is certainly entertaining.<br />Charlie Bone and his widowed mother live more or less under the thumbs of his horrible grandmother -- until the day he starts hearing photographs speaking. His horrible great-aunts are elated. It turns out that Charlie is one of the \\"children of the Red King,\\" and so has a specific magical talent. Because his mother was not magical and his father was, they weren't sure if he would be, and now they know.<br />Though Charlie doesn't want to go, he is quickly enrolled in Bloor's Academy for gifted children. A man with three unusually intelligent cats is lurking around the place, his uncle Paton is stirred from his lethargy, and Charlie begins to learn about a missing child from many years before. A child that, for some reason, someone doesn't want him to find...<br />Jenny Nimmo's book isn't outstanding, but it is quite nice. While the ending wraps up this particular story, it's clear that there are sequels in mind. With a combination of ordinary and \\"endowed\\" people, and a sprinkling of unique talents (one boy can sense the previous owners of clothing), this can stand on its own with no comparisons to Harry Potter. This one is a little darker, a little weirder.<br />The concept of the Red King is an interesting one, especially the slightly dark tone of the good and bad \\"endowed\\" people's responses to one another. The particular quirks, like the intelligent cats, the flashbacks, and the material about Charlie's may-not-be-dead father are also quite good. Her writing style is a little too spare, not giving much detail, and the handling of the \\"endowed\\" school is rather unassuming.<br />Charlie himself is a likable character, as is his timid pal Benjamin. The sinister grandmother and great-aunts aren't quite as well-fleshed out, and his schoolmates have potential but aren't quite there yet. (I guess we'll have to wait for the sequels) Uncle Paton is one of the standouts, a moody and introverted guy who causes lightbulbs and windows to explode.<br />\\"Midnight for Charlie Bone\\" isn't quite as good as the Magickers or Chrestomanci series, but it is a solid read that kids may enjoy.

Lots of concept art. The \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie trilogy is brimming over with incredibly detailed and exquisite effects, props and costumes, and though not entirely satisfying, this book gives a lot of good material.<br />In it, Gary Russell handles many different aspects of the movie sets and costumes, no matter how tiny they are. Here you'll find different places: sketches of the Black Gate and Dead Marshes, different Golden Halls of Rohan (right down to the medieval tapestries on the walls, the ornate chairs, cups, and even the door knockers!), Isengard, Fangorn forest (and the way different light made it seem), the glittering caves (only shown briefly in the movie) and many other places.<br />Costumes include unused Arwen armor and her more-dresses-than-she-has-scenes wardrobe; Theoden's battle armor, Eowyn's dresses (ranging from regal to homespun), and the new, more regal outfit of Gandalf the White. And for the weirder, there are different kinds of wargs (one looks almost wormlike), different extinguished Balrogs, and many different kinds of Ents, some of whom will be recognizable from the movie.<br />There are paintings, pencil sketches, exquisitely-detailed clay models from WETA Workshops, and photographs of the finished products. \\"Art of Two Towers\\" is, like the previous book, a must-read for those who enjoy seeing how movies evolve. The little comments beside most of the pictures add extra insight as to what the brilliant people who did all this were thinking. (They can also be very funny, such as the dying-Balrog discussions -- how often do people say \\"creature of slime\\" so seriously?)<br />This book is not flawless, however. It doesn't seem very well-organized: Gandalf's costume study is plopped in the middle of the \\"Fangorn\\" section when it would have been better with the Rohirrim outfits. Some of the concept paintings (such as the people leaving Rohan, or Saruman down among the orcs) are very splotchy. And I'm not sure why concept art for Rivendell is included since most of the Rivendell stuff was in the first movie.<br />\\"The Art of Two Towers\\" is not quite as strong as its predecessor.

Tamar loses more than the game -- his life is now Jaya's. Then he wakes up, with no sign of Jaya, and an iron ring on his finger. Honor demands that he travel to Jaya and offer his life, and despite the wishes of the wise old Rajaswami, he sets out.<br /><br />Along the way, Tamar encounters first a thieving monkey who was once a man, a quirky wise-man. and a beautiful gopi (cowgirl) Mirri, with whom he falls in love. But soon Tamar's internal struggle becomes even more pronounced: He learns of a villainous noble who is threatening all of them.<br /><br />Many of Lloyd Alexander's books have a formula cast: a young hero with a lesson to learn, a smart heroine, a quirky older man, and usually a few lovable animal sidekicks. Here it works very well. Alexander also includes an unusual commentary on the Indian caste system, on how unfair it is. Tamar goes from horror at just looking at one of the chandala (\\"the lowest of the low\\") to calling one of them his friend; his true friends don't care about his supposedly contaminated state, because they care more about him than about castes. And Alexander's look at honor and the keeping of one's word is also amazing.<br /><br />The plotting is exceptionally intricate -- Alexander is adept at giving little twists and unexpected turns in his plots, but \\"Iron Ring\\" may be the most complex book he's yet written. His writing isn't quite as detailed as some of his other books, but the dialogue is still enjoyable and well-written. Perhaps my only quibble is that ALL the animals talked, not just the once-human ones, or the really unusual ones.<br /><br />Tamar is a classic Alexander hero -- he has a lot to learn, but he's enthusiastic, good-hearted and likable. His hesitation to stay with Mirri is also well-written, since his life belongs to Jaya. Mirri herself is a sharp, no-nonsense heroine that readers will like; Rajaswami is a sweet old guy who is completely loyal to Tamar. Then there is Hashkat, the thieving, lazy monkey who is surprisingly loyal, and Garuda, the ugliest and most annoying eagle imaginable.<br /><br />\\"The Iron Ring\\" is among Alexander's finest fantasy books, melding myth with his own storyline and likable characters.

The first book of the Iron Tower trilogy, \\"Dark Tide,\\" was irritating and poorly-written, full of elements lifted straight from \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" One would expect that it couldn't get worse in \\"Shadows of Doom.\\" Astonishingly, it does.<br />Picking up where the previous book left of, the Spawn attack the wagons leaving Challerain Keep, killing everyone except Igon (who almost dies) and Laurelin, who is captured and taken to Modru's dungeons. Elsewhere, Patrel and Danner return to the Boskydells, only to find that Modru's Horde has attacked. Galen, Tuck and Gildor set out to find the armies of the late king, teaming up with a very rude dwarf named Brega along the way. Being pursued by Vulgs, they have no choice but to venture into the evil-filled dwarf citadel of Kraggen-Cor.<br /><br />Not only does the pace slow in \\"Shadows,\\" but the characters become even flatter and duller and the elements become even more blatantly Tolkienesque. The writing is terrible, the dialogue laughable, and the derivative elements aren't helped by poor plotting. A pivotal plot point appears most of the way through the book, utilizing the cliched villain-gloats-and-explains-his-evil-plot tactic; the attack on the Boskydells has no real impact on the plot, except to make Tuck cry.<br /><br />The Warrows are copies of Tolkien's hobbits, but lacking in the enthusiastic charm of those particular \\"wee folk,\\" which the quality that makes people love them so much; the Warrows lack charm, strength, or courage. Similarly with the derivative Elves, who are immortal, cultured, elegant, and dull as ditchwater. Dwarves are crabby and crusty, lacking in personality; medieval human Men are even duller than Warrows or Elves, and the assorted evil beasties who menace our heroes (copies of orcs, uruk-hai, Nazgul and wargs) are not-so-veiled copies of Tolkien's works. Moria, the Dwarves (or as he calls them, the Chakka), the squid-beast, and the Balrog -- in \\"Shadows,\\" you can find unexciting copies of all of the above. At a certain point, you stop goggling in horror and just find it all immensely funny.<br /><br />Tuck is still as annoying as he was before, crying and asking stupid questions, although he's somewhat easier to ignore. Still, the idea that McKiernan is setting this little twerp up as an alternate Frodo Baggins is nothing short of hysterical. Galen's sole moment of character development is some very contrived conflict over who to rescue (a real king would not experience any conflict -- he'd do his duty, no dithering). Gildor is still quite dull; Brega is abrasive and bossy; Danner and Patrel lose whatever shreds of personality they might have had. And Modru was a lot more frightening before we actually saw him.<br /><br />The female characters are still passive, boring and lacking in any strength, except McKiernan tries to make us think otherwise. Laurelin stabs a Ghul after lying down and crying through a fight scene, then sits and cries for the rest of the book. Merrilee, at the Boskydells, has to be verbally defended by Danner when she proves unable to speak up for herself and her fighting skills, then starts sobbing into a male shoulder after a battle (the implication is that women cry when there's a fight). You go, girl.<br /><br />McKiernan's writing remains hideously repetitive and weird. As if the readers are incapable of remembering anything more than a page back, he constantly mentions that the Mere is black, Tuck's eyes are \\"sapphirine\\" and sparkle, that Brega is gruff, and that Elves are graceful. The characters often act in bizarre ways, such as the escaping Patrel and Danner laughing like a pair of recently escaped mental patients; the fight scenes are absurdly hard to visualize, except for the battle with the Gargon (which is just silly -- how often do heavy footsteps sound like \\"Doom\\"?).<br /><br />\\"Shadows of Doom\\" o'ertops\\"Dark Tide\\" like a wave of Shadowlight. It's a painful experience unless you stop taking it seriously. Derivative, poorly-written, lacking in any interesting qualities at all.\\"Dark Tide\\" like a wave of Shadowlight.

While the book itself is fairly enjoyable, there's a not-so-pleasant surprise in store for fans who purchase \\"In the Shadow of the Warlock Lord.\\"<br />Shea Ohmsford is not like the other inhabitants of Shady Vale -- he's part Elf. Despite this, he's always been one of the boys in his sheltered village with his adopted family, until the day the Druid Allanon arrives to tell him of his destiny; he's the descendant of the legendary Jerle Shannara, and the one who can use the Sword of Shannara against the Warlock Lord. Dark forces are clustering around Shady Vale, and soon Shea is forced to leave with his brother Flick, on a quest to find the sword.<br />The problem with this book is... it's not a new book. It's not even a complete book; rather, it appears to be half of the preexisting \\"Sword of Shannara\\" novel. In the manner of the split Robert Jordan novel, the first book of the Shannara series has been cut into parts and is being sold as separate volumes. Aside from this detail, those intimidated by the size of the complete novel may prefer this book. Others may be severely disappointed by the lack of conclusion in this book.<br />... His writing is descriptive, a bit overblown, but not too badly. His characters, while not earth-shattering, are pleasant and likable, such as the reluctant hero Shea and his more suspicious brother Flick.<br />While the concept of repackaging the Shannara books for kids and young adults is an interesting one, there is little warning that this is not a new story, but merely a preexisting one split into parts.

While the books aren't amazing, they are solid and very interesting.<br />\\"When the Tripods Came\\" is a haunting look at an alien invasion that no one could have expected. In the not-too-distant future, strange three-legged machines descend on Earth, only to be destroyed. Then a mysterious TV show mesmerizes many people, followed by a second wave of Tripods -- these welcomed by the eager citizens of Earth. Laurie and his friends must try to escape....<br />\\"The White Mountains\\" takes place long after the prequel. Earth has lost disease, war, hunger, misery... and life. Though people go about their everyday activities, the enormous alien Tripods have effectively stagnated human civilization -- through the mind-controlling Caps. Thirteen-year-old Will is creeped-out by the Caps (which has evolved into a rite of passage) and when he learns of a human stronghold unaffected by the Tripods, he and his friends set out to find them.<br />\\"The City of Gold And Lead\\" is the destination of Will, Henry and Beanpole, in the Games that are held every year for young men. The victor will be taken to the City of the Tripods, and may gain valuable information about these alien invaders. The problem is, when a person enters the City, he doesn't return again. And the information Will finds may be the most dangerous and valuable yet.<br />\\"The Pool of Fire\\" wraps up the series effectively. Will has made his escape and is hurrying back with a terrifying revelation: The invaders are planning to effectively kill off the human race by changing the atmosphere. So, of course, they have to fight back (with booze, of all thins) and defeat the Masters before the human race becomes extinct.<br />John Christopher tends to excel in writing postapocalyptic fantasy/scifi, with mixed resuls. As that subgenre is very tired by now, the results vary from good to bad. The Tripod series is not actually postapocalyptic in the typical sense; it's a simple alien invasion story. But Christopher manages to study human nature and what is important in these stories. It's a bit like Jack Finney's \\"Invasion of the Bodysnatchers,\\" in its study of human nature.<br />His writing and dialogue are rather stiff. Though he does a good job of describing things, there's little sense of you-are-there because even in action scenes, there's a detached quality. Despite this, he shows exceptional skill in mapping out this future Earth, similar yet different. The ideas he presents are extremely original, from the Masters to the Tripods to the sinister invasion of Earth.The battle between humans and aliens is definitely a winner.<br />While not perfect, the Tripod series is an entertaining, sometimes chilling read that adults and kids will probably both appreciate. Solid scif stories, quite well-done.red by now, the results vary from good to bad. The Tripod series is not actually postapocalyptic in the typical sense; it's a simple alien invasion story.

The sequel syndrome hasn't hit \\"Hidden Truth,\\" and fans of Cook's first book won't be disappointed.<br />The evil Keeper Bailic has the First Truth book, but he can't open it. Believing that the piper Strell is the person who can, he tries to teach Strell magic -- not knowing that Alissa is really the blossoming Keeper. While Bailic frustrates himself with Strell, Alissa is learning magic from the raku-Master Talo-Toecan (also known as \\"Useless\\"), except that she seems to be far ahead of where she should be -- with more powers than she should have. And there's a friend of Useless's named Lodesh, who is charming, weird, interested in Alissa, and totally mysterious.<br />Alissa has to perform the magical tasks for Strell, so that he seems to be gaining skill -- at the same time, she learns that she may never get to be with him. Soon Bailic's plans become very, very clear -- he wants to raise an army of the dead, from the city of Ese' Nawoer, which is filled with thousands of guilt-wracked ghosts. But to do that, he has to use the First Truth. And in order to stop him, Alissa will have to learn about what she can do -- and what she might become.<br />Dawn Cook's fantasies avoid most of the fantasy cliches by not trying to avoid them. She has a small, well-developed cast, a simple cultural backdrop, interesting magic, and a very interesting cast. The villain is given an actual reason to do what he does, and the heroes have to be patient and think. And while this is a satisfactory conclusion to the first book, there are enough loose threads -- the vanished or feral Masters, for example -- that there is plenty left to explore if Cook chooses to.<br />Probably the biggest problem with this story is the pacing -- like \\"First Truth,\\" it drips steadily for about two hundred and fifty pages, then speeds up to a delicious climax. And the medieval setting seems a little out of sync with all the talk about genetics and neural nets. Her writing is detailed but not obsessively so, and some scenes -- such as the ghosts' attack, or when the book is first opened -- are shatteringly vivid.<br />Alissa is still likably stubborn, but has to grow up a great deal more in this book; she's come a long way from the rather petulant farm girl. Strell is a sweetie, sensitive or tough as the occasion demands, and his sort-of-romance with Alissa is wonderfully done. Talo-Toecan is pleasantly snappish and crabby, but very protective of Alissa, and Lodesh is delightfully charming and occasionally irritating.<br />Though it lacks in a few areas, Dawn Cook's second novel is overall a pleasant and intriguing fantasy adventure. Thoroughly enjoyable.delicious climax. And the medieval setting seems a little out of sync with all the talk about genetics and neural nets.

In some ways similar to the movie \\"Ice Storm,\\" this book takes place in the same year, on the other side of the Atlantic. Poignant, touching, sad, funny, and often quite weird.<br />In 1973, dreamy Benjamin Trotter is in school with a bunch of his pals, experiencing their first serious interests in girls and ; his sister Lois dreams of exotic lands, and starts dating a \\"Hairy Guy,\\" Malcolm. As the next few years go by, Lois's life is shattered by a horrifying act, and Benjamin struggles up into adolescence, falling in love with the school flirt and writes as an aspiring journalist. He and the other boys struggle to create and play as rock bands (among the names are \\"Gandalf's Pikestaff\\"), write fake letters to the school paper, have their \\"firsts\\" with girls, encounter racism and terrorism and begin to grow up.<br />\\"Rotters' Club\\" is hard to summarize, partly because of the wide cast of characters, the complex stories and the somewhat unfinished nature of it. (Coe reassures the reader at the end that there's going to be a sequel) It's a brave author who tackles racism, politics, history, changing senses of what is acceptable, and many other issues; Coe does this, and more. While condemning the IRA bombings in England, he reminds the reader that the British are far from innocent historically; he shows us racism, labor strikes, and the gradual disintegration of the class structure. Against this, he also provides a good look into the minds of adolescents that are struggling up into their adult lives and relationships.<br />\\"Rotters' Club\\" is also incredibly funny. From the rock band names (Tolkien-inspired) to the swimming trunks incident, this book is full of the sort of hilarious things that happen in real life. When swim trunks are forgotten, the boy has to swim naked; when that boy roughhouses in the pool, he is forced to stand on the diving board... from which he is quite visible from the roads nearby. And the bigoted satire letters from the fictional \\"old soldier\\" Arthur Pusey-Hamilton are insanely funny.<br />Benjamin is a perpetual innocent, no matter what he sees, hears or does; his romantic turn of mind is almost childlike in its lack of guile or bluster. Even a terrorist bomb can't make him hate others, only not understand. (Although he needs to stop writing thirty-page-long sentences about sleeping with Cicely) Lois is haunting as a dreamer in her own right, whose life is upturned by being in the wrong place at the wrong time. All the characters, no matter how dislikable they may seem, are deeper than one would expect. Cicely Boyd, for example, seems like a shallow flirt at first, but gradually we see her respond to Ben.<br />Coe's writing is slow and careful, giving us plenty of detail into the lives of 1970s British teenagers. His dialogue is well-written, as are the tasteful descriptions of the less-than-pleasant parts (such as the bomb explosion). And his attitude is a mixture of amusement and reminiscence.<br />All the silly clothes and shifting rock bands aside, \\"Rotters' Club\\" is a perfect balance of nostalgia fiction and realism, comedy and drama. It's a masterful book, and not one to be missed.boy roughhouses in the pool, he is forced to stand on the diving board... from which he is quite visible from the roads nearby.

Tolkien worked on his incredibly complex, vivid invented world his entire life. Now, with the epic movie trilogy hitting theaters, the books are getting the royal treatment. But even if you're a longtime fan, this book is an invaluable tool if you can't remember what the heck Angmar was or who Elendil was.<br />From A to Z (&quot;Abyss&quot; to &quot;Zirakzigil&quot;), Foster carefully includes entries from the LOTR trilogy, the Silmarillion, the Hobbit, and lots of other books by Tolkien. He carefully includes dates, when people were born and died, translated names (Legolas's is &quot;Greenleaf,&quot; Tom Bombadil's is &quot;Old--without father&quot;), and what language those names are in. For the sake of clarity, he also includes a timeline up until Elrond was born, and then several of Tolkien's created family trees. (Who was Elrond's great-grandpa?)<br />If you simply can't remember something -- like Aragorn's many and varied names, what Gandalf is, what the Elvish name for hobbits is -- then this can refresh your memory. While there are a few inevitable errors, Foster is exceedingly careful and faithful to Tolkien's work. If it's set down in here, you can bet that it's correct. The one slightly distracting aspect of this book is that the characters with two names are listed by their given name, not family name. So Frodo Baggins is listed under F, not B; Sam Gamgee is under S, not G.<br />So if you're a fan of the books, just getting into them, or even have only seen the movies and want to understand Middle-Earth a little better, you should definitely check out &quot;Complete Guide to Middle-Earth.&quot; For anyone who enjoys Tolkien's work, it's a keeper.	2003-04-30

With \\"The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents,\\" Terry Pratchett took his Discworld series into young adult turf (actually, these aren't too different from the adult books). Now he sprinkles more grass seed on that turf with \\"The Wee Free Men.\\"<br />Tiffany Aching (great name) is a young witch-in-training, which is complex enough. But now her spoiled, troublesome little brother Wentworth has been kidnapped by the Queen of the Elves of Fairyland (these aren't Tolkien's fair, nice Elves -- they can be quite mean), and in true legendary tradition, Tiffany has to find him.<br />So Tiffany arms herself with a talking toad (courtesy of witch mentor Mrs. Tick) a frying pan, and not much else. (She hasn't quite got her magic yet...) And her new allies as the Nac Mac Feegles, also known as the Wee Free Men -- they're tiny, tattooed, and quite feisty and funny. But even with the Wee Free Men on her side, the sinister forces of the Elf Queen may not let her get Wentworth back...<br />Terry Pratchett has a certain talent for creating skewed and funny fantasy ideas. The Wee Free Men are a bit reminiscent of ancient Celts and Picts with their tattoos, sheep,, drinking and swords. (They are, however, six inches tall) These guys are funny additions to the ever-growing flat world and hopefully we'll see more of them.<br />Pratchett's dialogue is still funny and sharp His writing style is minimalist, sort of a funnier, lighter version of Robert Zelazny. But even though this book is labelled as being for the kids, there's no dumbing-down. And he peppers this story with some not-so-nice sprites, an eerie fairyland, and the sinister knife-toothed grimhounds. Nice stuff, there.<br />Like all of Pratchett's best heroes, Tiffany isn't the typical kind. She has \\"First Sight and Second Thoughts,\\" fights evil with a frying pan, and has a lot of doubts. She is, in short, quite likable and sympathetic. (And anyone with an annoying little brother or sister will understand her thoughts about Wentworth) The Elf Queen is a fantastic villain; the talking toad serves is an excellent foil for Tiffany. But the Wee Free Men steal the show.<br />It's anyone's guess how Terry Pratchett can write all these amazing books so fast. Kids and adults alike will enjoy \\"The Wee Free Men,\\" with its quirky Brit-humor and likable characters.

It feels like a final novel, both autobiographical and a musing about the art of writing. People who haven't tried to write probably won't appreciate this odd little novel as much as those who have.<br />Eugene Pota is a well-known author who produced an immensely successful modern classic many years ago. Though his books since then have been critical and monetary successes, all of them have been compared to that first book. Now, in his mid-seventies, Eugene reflects on the changing literary world and wants to write a mega-success, a fantastic book that will be loved and appreciated and possibly made into a movie.  That's a pretty tall order.<br />So he begins writing various books, such as the Biblical parody &quot;God's Wife,&quot; a book about Greek legends from the goddess Hera's point of view, a parody of &quot;Tom Sawyer,&quot; and a novel about a husband viewing his wife's &quot;transgressions.&quot; All of them don't quite work out...<br />Exactly how much of this book is autobiographical isn't clear -- between the witty final line and the stuff about Coney Island and &quot;God Knows,&quot; it's clear that much of Pota is actually Heller. One thing that Heller did in this book (besides homage himself) is reflect on the authors who have gone before him. There are lots of references to Henry James, Mark Twain, Jack London, and plenty of others; at the same time, he mulls over the tragic qualities of their lives. (The aborted &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; parody includes Tom going around looking for them)<br />This book, technically, is not about writer's block; rather it's about the frustration of feeling required to top yourself, and of a basic lack of inspiration. Not being able to write in the middle of a book is bad enough. But it's even worse when you have trouble just figuring out what you want to start out with.  Eugene's dogged attempts to do the impossible -- to top himself -- are pleasant to read about.<br />His writing is funny and insightful, but occasionally becomes a bit self-indulgent. And I wasn't sure what to make about the passages about Polly, Pota's wife. Meaning, I wasn't sure if she was based on his actual last wife and whether he was frustrated with her.<br />Some witty dialogue, amusing false starts and some genuinely poignant soul-baring fill this book. It's a shame the &quot;Old Man&quot; passed away before it was even published.possible -- to top himself -- are pleasant to read about.<br />His writing is funny and insightful, but occasionally becomes a bit self-indulgent.

Here she provides an unusual sorcerer, an unlikely heroine, and a lot of sly winks at fantasies and fairy tales. Very entertaining.<br />Sophie Hatter is the eldest of three daughters, which in this fantasyland means that she's the one who doesn't have an astounding \\"fortune\\" to seek. Instead she's stuck at the hat shop. One day a plump, very rude woman comes to see the hats, and Sophie uncharacteristically insults her. Unfortunately, this woman is the Witch of the Wastes, and responds by aging Sophie into a crone. Peeved out of being shy and retiring, she tramps off to the \\"Moving Castle\\" of the supposedly evil wizard Howl, who reportedly [steals] out the souls of young girls.<br />After arriving at the castle, she encounters Howl's pleasant apprentice and contracted fire demon Calcifer (who promises to disenchant Sophie if she breaks his contract). Though she annoys the rather self-absorbed Howl and drives Calcifer almost nuts at times, Sophie becomes the cleaning lady at the Moving Castle. She begins searching for the chewed-up hearts of the girls, only to find something a lot more bizarre -- including her own peculiar magic.<br />If you've ever read a fairy tale -- Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast -- you'll know that the youngest kids are always are the favored ones. They go on to marry princes or princesses, become wealthy and beloved. Jones mocks this and many other fairy-tale cliches, such as the hilarious scene where Sophie lurches around in seven-league boots. There's even a brief homage to J.R.R. Tolkien.<br />It's certainly an interesting twist to have a not-so-evil evil-wizard, a harried apprentice, and a heroine who appears to be in her nineties. Similarly, the ideas of the \\"Moving Castle\\" with its doors to other places (including modern Wales) is very original. That's not even mentioning the attacking scarecrow.<br />Until she's aged into a crone, Sophie isn't much of a heroine; she's too timid and dull to be of interest. Post-aging, she becomes interesting and delightfully pushy. Howl is not what you think of a \\"bad\\" wizard as; his tantrums over things like hair dye are hysterically funny, and he's also immensely attractive to the opposite sex. Michael is a good sidekick, with the common-sense that Howl lacks; Calcifur the fire demon is one of Jones' most memorable characters, especially when Sophie bullies him.<br />While it isn't quite as spectacular as Jones' Chrestomanci Chronicles, \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" will appeal to those who liked fantasy spoof \\"Dark Lord of Derkholm\\" and \\"Year of the Griffin.\\" A funny, thought-provoking magical ride.d into a crone, Sophie isn't much of a heroine; she's too timid and dull to be of interest.

Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.<br /><br />And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic. And with the first \\"Hobbit\\" movie coming out in a few months, it deserves revisiting.<br /><br />Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.<br /><br />But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.<br /><br />So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?<br /><br />Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.<br /><br />Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.<br /><br />This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.<br /><br />The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king.

But when the acid-tongued Fanny Tarrant writes a humiliating article about Sam, he entreats his old pals to help him.<br />Adrian tries to dig some dirt on Fanny, while revealing personal details about himself -- that he and Sam both slept with Eleanor in the sixties, when everyone was experimenting with relationships. Eleanor is enraged when she learns of this, and Sam isn't too pleased either. Will Fanny publish the embarrassing story?<br />It's not a huge or deep story, but it makes a sort of witty commentary on the media and how they affect and are affected by the people they report on. The rather exaggerated media article and the material on Princess Di (a woman whose death was partly attributable to the bullheaded press) add to the feeling.<br />The writing is very spare, as if Lodge merely wrote down the basic movements like stomping out, pulling down a piece of clothing, opening a door and so on. The dialogue -- unsurprising for a play-turned-novella -- is the main force in this story. The characters aren't perfect, and become rather annoying at times -- Adrian is stuffy, Sam is a bit self-absorbed, and I felt that if Eleanor wasn't happy, she should have said so outright rather than drifting around in a sort of identityless cloud.<br />It reads more like a play with action inserted and \\"he said\\" instead of the character's name. But \\"Home Truths\\" is a fairly amusing and well-plotted little story.	2003-04-24

The characters are pleasant but not amazing, the writing okay, the background generic but palatable. It's a bit like plain doughnuts -- they have a moderately pleasant taste while you're eating them, but nothing to really make you remember them afterwards.<br />Millennia ago, the Dark God Torak stole the Orb from his brother Aldur, and got maimed in the process. The sorcerer Belgareth spirited the Orb away and entrusted it to the pure-hearted King Riva, whose similarly pure-hearted descendants are the only ones who can use the orb. Much later, a mysterious stern woman named Pol is raising Garion on a farm, claiming to be his aunt. Also lurking around is a mischievous and cryptic old storyteller Wolf, who has an odd interest in the boy.<br />As Garion grows up in his peaceful home, he catches sight of sinister Murgos and shadowless specters. And one day he's whisked away by Pol and Wolf, and soon finds himself on a secretive journey with the two of them, a loyal smith, and a pair of mysterious and slightly peculiar warriors. Slowly Garion learns the truth not just about \\"Aunt Pol\\" and \\"Wolf,\\" but also about his own ancestry and his future destiny.<br />Eddings does get points for not having one character lecture another endlessly about the history of the Orb and the gods and so on; most of the relevant information is contained in the prologue. One thing that might annoy readers is that everyone (including every reader with half a brain) knows what is going on except Garion. He's the only person who doesn't have a clue, and since he only gets a clue in the final chapters of the book, it gets annoying to hear him wondering about the true identities of Wolf and Pol.<br />His writing is \\"middling\\"; there's not a lot of description, which is something of a rarity in fantasy books. Even so, the words aren't very imaginative -- Silk is only referred to as \\"weasel-faced,\\" and at one point we hear about Garion's blood reacting \\"boilingly\\" (is that even a word?) The pace moves pretty quickly. The kingdoms and cultures and characters are all very typical, and we've seen them many other places: archetypical King-Arthur boys-with-a-destiny, stern sorceresses, wise old wizards with twinkly eyes, evil forces, items of power, bumbling kings and ultra-strong warriors with dark secrets. Very cliched, all of it, but if that doesn't bother you then you will probably like it a great deal. And although you can predict all the plot twists early on, at least it doesn't derive heavily on Tolkien as many cliched fantasies do.<br />Garion is a likable enough kid, despite his relentless cluelessness; Polgara is stern and a bit arrogant, but kindly and loving underneath it. Belgarath may annoy some readers with his wink-nudge antics; Silk manages to rise above the trickster sidekick with a sharp tongue, and Barak adds a note of poignancy late in the book with the revelation of what will happen to him.<br />\\"Pawn of Prophecy\\" is, despite its solidly generic quality, a pleasant enough read if you want a book that isn't too taxing on your brain.

(In general, stories that were originally created to entertain kids are the best) Author J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper, and later concocted a complex and colorful bedtime story for his kids...<br />&quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.&quot; That hobbit is the determinedly normal Bilbo Baggins, whose comfortably boring life is turned upside-down when the wise wizard Gandalf turns up with thirteen dwarves. But they're not there just to abuse Bilbo's hospitality -- they're there to recruit him as a burglar, so that they can sneak back to the old dwarf stronghold of Lonely Mountain and reclaim it from the dragon Smaug.<br />Before Bilbo knows what's happening, he's being whisked off with the dwarves and Gandalf across Middle-Earth. His odd journey rapidly turns dangerous when they are captured by goblins, he is forced to riddle with a withered creature, finds a golden Ring that will turn its wearer invisible, and they are nearly devoured by monstrous spiders. And he hasn't even gotten to the Mountain yet -- where the dragon is still sleeping.<br />I was seven years old when I first read &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; which wasn't even the start of my appreciation for Tolkien. Now with the movie trilogy partly released, a new buzz of interest around anything and everything &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;-related has brought &quot;The Hobbit&quot; back into bookstore displays. This is a less serious, dark book than the Rings trilogy, but the charming tone and delightful, unexpectedly brave unlikely hero Bilbo will delight both kids and adults. At a bookstore recently, I saw a teenage boy insisting that &quot;Hobbit&quot; was not a children's book, because he still read it. (The final chapters hint at the future epic battles of the &quot;Rings&quot; trilogy, and several plot threads are picked up in those books as well, so note the details...)<br />&quot;The Annotated Hobbit&quot; is a special treat for Tolkien fans, or just people who want to know more about this book and about Tolkien's Middle-Earth. Pictures (Tolkien's own) are included in the middle of it; Douglas Anderson includes plenty of careful footnoting, citing works of mythology, legend, and careful usage of other books by Tolkien to back up his commentary. (For example, one major question is answered: Do Elves have pointy ears? Answer: Yes, and check this book to see why) The binding is nice and tight, the cover is one of Tolkien's illustrations (Smaug on the dwarves' gold), the paper is smooth and very pale so that the words are always clearly visible.<br />Needless to say, if you liked the movies or the books, you'll adore &quot;Hobbit.&quot; If you haven't read it, then do so. And then check out &quot;Annotated Hobbit,&quot; with its extras and bonuses. Great read.several plot threads are picked up in those books as well, so note the details...)<br />&quot;The Annotated Hobbit&quot; is a special treat for Tolkien fans, or just people who want to know more about this book and about Tolkien's Middle-Earth.

One of the new releases is Charles Sheffield's \\"Putting Up Roots,\\" an unexceptional but likable scifi story  with a good cast, though a slightly predictable storyline.<br />Joshua's mother, a self-absorbed actress, sends him to live with his relatives at Burnt Willow Farm. Having had a good time there eight years before, Joshua is pleased -- until he gets there. He learns that his aunt has died in that time, and his uncle has remarried a sharp-tongued shrew called Stacy, who doesn't hesitate to make him feel unwelcome. She isn't much kinder to her stepdaughter Dawn, an autistic girl who says practically nothing. But Dawn hears and understands a lot more than she seems.<br />Stacy, in an effort to get her husband to sell the farm, sends the two kids to the untamed planet of Solferino, which has only some lower animals and a lot of plants. To make matters worse, the transport has a bunch of other rejected kids -- four sisters with gemstone names (one of whom is a druggie), and three boys who have Wagnerian names (ex-street thugs). And when the kids arrive on Solferino, Joshua begins to suspect that their bullying supervisor is hiding a dark secret about Solferino's value -- and about the presence of innocent, intelligent creatures on it.<br />The pacing is the main problem with \\"Putting Up Roots\\" -- it starts off rapidly, lags for a long time, then picks up in the last chapters of the book. And the ruperts aren't as big a part of the story as you'd expect. Despite this, it's a fairly good SF adventure story, with its realistic corporate battles and suitably bizarre aliens and planets.<br />Joshua is a pretty likable hero, especially since he tends to take a very balanced view of what's good or bad. A lot of characters in that sort of situation start whining about what they don't want to do, but Sheffield doesn't. Dawn is a fairly good supporting character, but has a tendency to fade out when she isn't being focused on. Topaz is much more vivid and present in the story. And supporting characters like Sig and Saph are similarly good -- even if you don't totally like them, Sheffield will let you see why they are what they are.<br />His writing is pretty descriptive, but not immensely. (I occasionally felt frustrated when told that an object was brown and \\"rounded,\\" but nothing more) And he does an excellent job with the dynamics of the teens in the group -- not everybody is friendly, and not everyone trusts. If you like a little tension in your heroes rather than a big band of buddies, you'll like this.<br />\\"Putting Up Roots\\" isn't perfect, but a flair for characterization saves it from being totally average.

1152624:US	50881246	R282VJ0VZ4EW0O	0312282044	635506661	Diana and Jackie: Maidens, Mothers, Myths	Books	1	14	15	N	N	Straining to be scholarly	There are dozens of vapid biographies of both Jaqueline Kennedy Onassis and Princess Diana out there, but this book manages to do the work of two: It has vapid info on both of them! What a thrill! Jay Mulvaney strains to produce some sort of substantial comparison and contrast, but the result is less than satisfying. (Considering that his only other books are about Kennedys and clothing, I wasn't expecting anything too earth-shattering)<br />Using the trio of &quot;naiden, mother, myth&quot; (instead of &quot;maiden, mother, crone&quot;), he examines the lives of both Di and Jackie -- their childhoods, their marriages, the two children each of them had, their husbands, and their lives after their husbands (in Di's case, post-divorce; in both of Jackie's cases, in widowhood).<br />One of the biggest problems with this book is the superficiality. The book makes a great deal out of similarities that just don't mean much -- divorced parents, philandering husbands, overbearing in-laws, out-of-control weddings, and so on. But the fact is that though there are some similarities (both of them became irrational focuses for the masses), there isn't a lot of similarity under the surface.<br />Yes, both of them had divorced parents, but WHY they divorced is drastically different. Yes, both of their husbands cheated on them, but they had drastically different personas. Those husbands were a shy, spoiled aristocrat and an outgoing, charismatic elected leader; one actually NEEDED a wife to uphold his image in order to get his position, while the other just wanted one. Despite what Mulvaney says, Diana was not close to Jackie's level intellectually (by her own admission, no less). And their own personalities were at different ends of the scale -- outgoing and sensitive, versus private and almost snobby. The superficiality of things like divorced parents, pretty clothes, crazy weddings and obnoxious in-laws are clearly shown.<br />Moreover, Mulvaney seems to be one of those biographers who dreads speaking ill of anyone. He claims it would be &quot;harsh&quot; to refer to Rose Kennedy or Queen Elizabeth II as a bad mom. Well, Charles and Jack were quite harsh, then. Bad personality traits are watered down, obnoxious tendencies are diminished. The worst thing he says about Rose is that her memoirs are full of &quot;half truths and evasions.&quot; (Mulvaney has an evasion of his own: Rose disliked Jackie)<br />In short, this book can be summarized as: &quot;Jackie and Di had some similarities.&quot; It doesn't even provide interesting pictures or any new information whatsoever; everything in this book is gleaned from previous material. All the &quot;intertwining&quot; that Mulvaney can manage is to start many of the paragraphs with, &quot;Like Diana...&quot; or &quot;Like Jackie...&quot;<br />Basically, this book feels like an attempt to draw in Di and Jackie enthusiasts all at once. It could just as easily have been about Diana and Grace Kelly, or Jackie and Hillary Clinton. A quick'n'dirty, very generic read about the Windsors and Kennedys, and there ain't nothing new here.hers who dreads speaking ill of anyone.

Tolkien, and the portrayal of things like goblins, elves and generic medieval civilizations always hinge on how the Master did it. But Dennis McKiernan's books have a staggering, mind-blowing amount of \\"similarity,\\" so much so that the derivative elements far outweigh the original stuff.<br />Tuck Underbank is a Warrow (think a hobbit with shoes and \\"large jewel-like eyes\\") living in the peaceful Boskydells (think the Shire with a rather pitiful armed force). When an unnaturally cold winter strikes the world, he and a number of his fellow Thornwalkers go to the High King's aid. But a vast expanse of  lightless blizzard (called the Dimmendark -- with a name like that, it couldn't be bad, could it?) is spreading over the land, and Tuck soon finds that the \\"dark tide\\" is going to swamp them all.<br />The general feeling when reading \\"Dark Tide\\" or the other books of this trilogy is that McKiernan wanted to rewrite \\"Lord of the Rings\\" in his own way, including some nauseating romance and the idea of Warrows. There is literally nothing in here that Tolkien didn't do first and better; even some of the names, such as Gildor and Laurelin, are lifted directly, while others (Underbank, Proudhand) are barely altered.<br />The Warrows themselves are like hobbits on some sort of armed testosterone trip (imagine Frodo Baggins in the Marines -- silly image, isn't it?). The Boskydells are carbon-copied from the Shire, complete with McKiernan's own version of the Hedge. Aurion and Galen have close resemblances to Theoden and Aragorn; Gildor is a dull shade of Legolas. Rukhs, Hloks, and Ogrus are essentially similar to Tolkien's creations, as the Ghuls are like the Nazgul. He even throws in copies of less prominent Tolkien elements like Galadriel, Sting, the Rohirrim, and the supernatural elements (with Adon and Gyphon instead of Eru and Morgoth).<br />McKiernan writes in his own painful ye olde fantasye style, full of semicolons, mangled old-English phrases and dubious words like \\"naytheless.\\" He assigns four or five names to every species, land, seasonal holiday, and so forth -- then insists on trotting those names out whenever he can. Even worse, he can't keep the dialects of the Warrows and Elves up. One minute the Warrows sound like English countryfolk, then pirates, then Cockneys, then some sort of crazed redneck dialect. Sometimes these switches will happen on the same page, which makes them even weirder.<br />He also tries to duplicate Tolkien's style, spelling \\"wagon\\" as \\"waggons\\" and having crowd murmurs in italics, as well as having Tuck and Company switch from using contractions and ordinary words, to formal prose. Every now and then he throws in the word \\"lo.\\" And sometimes his use of words is bewildering: on the very first page, we hear about Tuck kicking up \\"clots\\" of snow.<br />The heroes are all buddies and pals -- if they have any problems, those difficulties are ironed out mere paragraphs later. And it gets kind of tiring to have all these seasoned, battle-hardened warriors and knights constantly talking about how great the Warrows are. Not to mention everybody crazily cheering Tuck killing only two of the enemy -- one by accident. They're very easily impressed, aren't they?<br />Tuck Underbank is a pitiful excuse for a hero; he cries literally every few pages, and needs to be led everywhere without ever taking the initiative. Danner and Patrel aren't much better. Gildor is a bland generic Elf who exists just to speak about things thousands of years in the past; Aurion and Galen are noble, kind, just, perfect, and dull as ditchwater. The female characters are nothing short of an insult: Merrilee is the token girlfriend for Tuck, apparently because McKiernan would have liked to see Frodo Baggins hit puberty in front of a hobbit girl. Laurelin is a sweet, innocent, beautiful, pure-as-the-driven-snow princess who manages to get herself kidnapped by the evil forces. (Another damsel in distress?)<br />There is a fine line between homage and outright theft. \\"Dark Tide\\" tears over that line and overshoots it by a mile. Even worse, this derivative and truly cringeworthy book is first of a trilogy, and the beginning of a series. Recommended for those who are looking for some good comic fantasy.er damsel in distress?)<br />There is a fine line between homage and outright theft. \\"Dark Tide\\" tears over that line and overshoots it by a mile.

And fans of her imaginative books won't be disappointed with \\"Merlin Conspiracy.\\"<br />Roddy has lived a fairly ordinary existance in an alternate version of Britain, as the daughter of two Court Wizards and part of the Progress (which goes around the Islands of Blest and gives various rituals where they are needed). Soon the Merlin (the sort of magical leader) dies and a new Merlin is chosen -- except the new Merlin may not be right for the job, because suddenly rituals and magic are going awry.<br />In a different world, a teenager named Nick slips into what seems to be a dream world -- but is actually another universe altogether. He wants to go to other worlds, but it turns out to be a lot more dangerous than he had believed it would be. And Roddy needs his help to fix the magic, before the conspiracy overwhelms them.<br />\\"Merlin Conspiracy\\" is, like most of Jones's books, complicated and twisted without being bewildering. The characterizations are tight and realistic, and the writing is quite good. \\"Merlin Conspiracy\\" shows a certain polish that comes from long experience, and Jones knows how to use her strengths by now.<br />Like many of her books, \\"Merlin Conspiracy\\" is funny and well-plotted. The dialogue is excellent (\\"If you say \\"Alicia\\" quickly it sounds just like a well-behaved sneeze - just like Alicia, in fact.\\") And though this book is written in the first person, unlike many of Jones's books, it doesn't detract from her deft writing.<br />Roddy and Nick are flawed in a likable way. Roddy is a bit bossy and fussy at times, and Nick is more languid and inclined to take things less seriously. They seem very real. Grundo and the \\"Merlin\\" are also quite well written; so is the very large and unusual cast, including obnoxious witch twins, assassins, the lord of the dead, dragons, goats, silver tea services, and plenty of wizards...<br />\\"Merlin Conspiracy\\" is a fun fantasy for adults and kids alike (regardless of age, you have to be drawn in by the complex plotting). Definitely an entertaining read, and no sign of Jones's talents on the wane.and plenty of wizards...<br />\\"Merlin Conspiracy\\" is a fun fantasy for adults and kids alike (regardless of age, you have to be drawn in by the complex plotting).

And the intent of it is pretty clear, since the story could easily be called \\"Lord of the Rings: The Next Generation.\\" It's not quite as openly derivative as the Iron Tower trilogy, but it comes pretty close.<br />A few centuries have elapsed since the Winter War. Perry Fairhill is a Warrow living in the Boskydells, a historian who manages a museum of Winter War artifacts. (He's also the direct descendant of Tuck Underbank, dubious hero of the Iron Tower Trilogy) One day a pair of Dwarfs and Prince Kian arrive, seeking help: They want to retake the mountain kingdom of Kraggen-cor, which is now overriden with beasties.<br />Perry is absolutely thrilled at the idea of going to glorious battle, but his faithful handman Cotton Buckleburr isn't so sure. They accompany the Dwarves to the doors of Kraggen-Cor, and team up with a local wood-elf. But the door is guarded by a hideous squidlike beast, and even if they get inside, there's an army of evil creatures waiting for them.<br />This might have been a fairly enjoyable brain-fluff read, if it weren't clearly meant as a sequel to \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" Virtually every element in this book is copied from that gorgeous book. While the characterizations are improved, as are the romance, it's not enough to save this story.<br />The very idea of the story is copied from Tolkien, in that we're presented with a Dwarf kingdom identical to Moria; Warrows, who are basically big-eyed hobbits with shoes; the Boskydells/Shire and the Thornwall/Hedge; the Elves and most of their characteristics; the little silver horn; the squidlike beast; the Dwarves, or as McKiernan calls them, the Chakka; the \\"silveron\\" (think mithril) armor, and many others.<br />Perry and Cotton are much more likable than Tuck, Patrel, Danner and the insanely annoying Warrows from the Iron Tower trilogy. Sadly, they are also thinner copies of Sam and Frodo: Perry has many of the more superficial characteristics that Frodo has, while being much flakier and ditzier. Cotton is like a dumber, more self-deprecating version of Sam (with a mangled version of the same accent, no less). Kian is okay, and doesn't take himself as incredibly seriously as many of McKiernan's characters. The Dwarves aren't particularly likable; even worse, they're more or less interchangable. Vanidar Shannon Silverleaf, the Generic Elf, simply doesn't make an impression at all. He's there, he's on the good guys' side, and there isn't much more to him.<br />The songs in this would be much more enjoyable, if one of them weren't so similar to the \\"Road Goes Ever On\\" song. And repetition, one of McKiernan's biggest weaknesses, will drive many patient readers up the wall. At one point, Perry's blood leaps and heart pounds four times in two pages (active circulatory system he's got!). If you hate repetition then the constant casting of hoods over faces will drive you crazy. Not to mention all the surprised exclaiming whenever someone meets a Warrow.<br />\\"Silver Call\\" is a better story than \\"Iron Tower,\\" but that really isn't saying much. Not recommended unless you're a [] Mithgar fan, or if you are just craving stories about tiny people.rodo: Perry has many of the more superficial characteristics that Frodo has, while being much flakier and ditzier.

Then her bear-mother was killed, and the feral child was taken in and raised by a childless couple, until her mother died. One day an enormous creature attacks the cottage, killing Atalanta's father. Before he dies, he gives her a ring that is the only clue to where she might come from. But Atalanta doesn't particularly want to be with humans, as she informs the nature-god Pan.<br />She teams up with an old playmate (a bear) whom she calls Urso. She rescues Urso from a village of hunters, and spends time near other humans -- until the hunters come upon a monstrous winged lion. She teams up with Urso and the legendary hunter Orion to hunt down the winged lion.<br />As with the previous two books, this one has plenty of action, lots of trivia about Greek mythology, legend and everyday life, and the gods and heroes bob in and out of it. Artemis (kind of petulant) and Pan (likably weird and quirky) both make appearances, as does the skilled but rather boastful Orion (who was immortalized as a constellation -- Orion the Hunter, and Orion's Belt).<br />Atalanta is a good heroine -- she craves freedom, has a strong sense of herself, and defnitely grows and changes over the course of the story. Orion is as he should be, proud but pretty likable. Urso is proof that you don't need dialogue to be a good character -- he's a bear, but he has more likability to him than most fictional characters who DO talk. And I liked Pan, of course.<br />Yolen's writing is quick and sometimes humorous, though this is a more somber book than \\"Odysseus.\\" The dialogue isn't hard to understand, and she shows an exceptional ability to make legends and myths very palatable. And the sense of menace and danger around the winged lion is very believable.<br />Fans of Greek myth and fantasy will enjoy \\"Atalanta and the Arcadian Beast\\" -- a solid, fast-paced, well-written story of the Age of Heroes.

Here she makes a rather worn area of fantasy seem new, in \\"Sword of the Rightful King.\\" There's magic, treachery, a bit of romance and plenty of suspense and humor.<br />Arthur has been king of all Britain for four years now, but not everyone is willing to accept him as their king. The most dangerous among these is the North Witch, Arthur's half-sister Morgause, whose four elder sons are heading to Arthur's court -- and there is an assassin among them. (Gawain seems very loyal but might be bewitched by his mother; his brother Agravaine is almost insanely aggressive, and the twins are ditzy).  What's more, the old mage Merlinnus encounters a young boy in the forest who has a mysterious past and a grudge against Gawain.<br />So Merlin concocts a means of solidifying Arthur's kingship -- a sword embedded in a stone, that can only be pulled by the true king. Arthur pulls it from the stone, and everyone accepts him as king. Simple, right? Except that the North Witch is still spinning her spells, and she plans to get her hands on the sword first -- no matter what.<br />Though there's no real connection between the two books, I felt like I was reading a sequel to Yolen's previous novel \\"Dragon's Boy.\\" Perhaps it was the portrayal of Merlin and Arthur -- they have a sort of father-son bond, and even though Arthur often doesn't listen to Merlin they obviously care about each other. And Merlin, although a bit decayed physically, is still the sharpest knife in the drawer. Though this book has magic (including a homicidal dagger) and the other didn't, it felt very much like a follow-up.<br />Yolen's writing is quick and fast-moving, with excellent dialogue and some very good descriptions of things like the eerie May Queens. She carefully presents what was very touchy at the time, such as the unacknowledged rivalry of old religions like Mithras-worship and the newer Christianity. And she mixes in the more medieval stuff with historical details, such as the Picts.<br />Arthur is a likable guy here -- not perfect, but nice and friendly and honest. Gawain is similar in personality; Gawen is never less than endearing, and his secrets turn out to be... well, a lot different than anyone would suspect, especially when you consider who gets married at the end. Agrivaine seemed a little too nuts at times, but he was supposed to be that way. Merlinnus is the lovable old mage who knows how the world works; Morgause is nasty and cold-hearted, and Yolen isn't afraid to show her at work.<br />For an old tale told a bit differently, \\"Sword of the Rightful King\\" doesn't even falter. Expect to be surprised by quite a few aspects of this story, and to enjoy the humor and poignancy.

Tolkien wrote this in a charming, arch style, and seems to have had fun subverting some of the fantasy cliches that he helped create -- particularly that of the dragonslaying hero and the dragon he must deal with.<br /><br />Aegidius de Hammo (or in the \\"vulgar tongue,\\" as Tolkien archly tells us, Farmer Giles of Ham) is a pleasant, not-too-bright farmer (a bit like Barliman Butterbur) who leads a fairly happy, sedate life. Until the day his excitable dog Garm warns him that a giant (deaf and very near-sighted) is stomping through and causing mayhem. Giles takes out his blunderbuss and takes a shot at the giant, and inadverantly drives him off.<br /><br />Naturally, Giles is hailed as a hero. Even the King is impressed, and sends him the sword Caudimordax (vulgar name: Tailbiter), which belonged to a dragonslaying hero. By chance, the not-so-fierce dragon Chrysophylax Dives has started pillaging, destroying and attacking the nearby areas. Can a not-so-heroic farmer drive off a not-so-frightening dragon?<br /><br />\\"Farmer Giles of Ham\\" is one of those Tolkien stories that seems to be aimed at very literate kids, or adults who haven't lost that taste for very British, arch whimsy. It's a fast, fun little adventure story with blundering giants, greedy dragons and unlikely heroes. It's not epic and it's not deep, but it is entertaining -- especially since Tolkien expertly blends the whole high fantasy thing with a wicked sense of humour (\\"if it is your notion to go dragonhunting jingling and dingling like Canterbury Bells, it ain't mine\\").<br /><br />Particularly, Tolkien seems to be gently mocking medieval fables, both as a linguist (the \\"vulgar tongue\\" comments) and as a storyteller (he young dragons exclaiming that they always knew \\"knights were mythical!\\"). Most particularly, he seems to be mocking the classic heroes who slay dragons or giants, mainly by making both heroes and monsters not quite as threatening as expected. He inserts plenty of humorous anachronisms (the blunderbuss) and clever in-jokes (Caudimordax, a sword which is incapable of being sheathed if a dragon is within five miles of it).<br /><br />Farmer Giles is a pretty fun character -- he's presented as a fairly ordinary, common-sensical person called upon to do some bizarre and extraordinary things... so, basically a typical Tolkien hero, although he has a talking dog that keeps causing trouble for him. His enemy Chrysophylax is in a sense his opposite, being \\" cunning, inquisitive, greedy, well-armoured, but not over bold.\\" He's kind of like a funny version of Smaug, minus the destruction of cities.<br /><br />\\"Farmer Giles of Ham\\" is a charming little chunk of Tolkien's minor work -- a relentlessly wry, clever little fantasy story about a most unlikely hero.

Author Joseph Heller developed a nerve disease called Guillain-Barre after years of seeming good health, and later wrote a book (coauthored by his pal Speed Vogel) chronicling his declining health and his fight back to semi-normality.<br />It was a day like any other, just before getting a divorce and starting a new novel (which became \\"God Knows\\"). But Joseph Heller found that his food tasted funny, his body felt abnormally heavy, and he was having problems putting on and removing clothing. He checked into a hotel, and sure enough -- he had had a problem. What's more, he had a nerve disease called Guillain-Barre, which could cause permanent paralysis.<br />While his mind remained sharp and unusually witty, Heller's body became paralyzed. His pals Speed Vogel, Mario Puzo (of \\"Godfather\\" fame), Dustin Hoffman and Mel Brooks all clustered around to help their friend as he began to regain control of his life.<br />The account is funny and kooky, full of eccentric people like Puzo and Brooks. But there are deeper undercurrents in \\"No Laughing Matter,\\" in which the friends help keep Heller from sinking into a frenzy of displeasure and cabin fever. There are no gooey monologues about the power of love and friendship -- it would probably have made the authors gag, even if it didn't make the readers. But the accounts of an admittedly difficult-to-deal-with famous author being helped out, despite his eccentricity, is very touching.<br />There is a lot of serious content, with Heller's decline in health and the details of his time in the hospital. (Constantly lying in a hospital bed, mostly paralyzed, unable to grip a pen and with a tube in his nose) But he manages to give a funny spin to almost everything in the book, including his encounters with Valerie Humphrey, a beautiful nurse who became his second wife, and media-shy Mario Puzo telling him how lucky he was to be sick and paralyzed, since he wouldn't be require do interviews. Half the book is Speed Vogel's voice; he offers an alternate, somewhat humbler viewpoint. He also gives more entertaining anecdotes such as Mel Brooks painting his \\"SNORE! SNORE!

Fantasy writer Dennis McKiernan's latest novel is no better than his previous outings, and by recycling old material and bringing in new and unoriginal elements, managed toi drive me nuts in entirely new ways.<br />Camille lives in a decrepit cottage near the border of Faery, with her meek father, money-hungry mother, sickly brother, and five sisters. One day a massive bear appears at the door, saying that Lord Alain of the Summerland (in Faery) wants to marry Camille (why? He saw her dancing). At first she doesn't want to, but she agrees because of her brother's illness. The bear takes her into Faery, past evil goblins and a year-round blizzard, to the beautiful mansion of Prince Alain.<br />Of course, they fall in love, even though Alain is never around during the day and always wears a mask.  What's more, although they're in bed for what seems like half the book, they can't get married -- why? Alain won't say. Under pressure from her mom, Camille uses a candle to peek at her boyfriend's face during the night, only to have him and all his servants vanish. She sets off across Faery to find her beloved and lift the curse.<br />The book is based on the \\"East of the Sun and West of the Moon\\"; that story itself is a rather mangled retelling of the legend of Eros and Psyche. (The original is the best one) And this retelling of the fairy tale is somewhat marred by the cheesy romance, unappealing and clueless heroine, and meandering plotline.<br />The dialogue is beyond absurd; at one point, Camille says to the bear, \\"Oh Bear, I am wholly apprehensive. Remain my protector, please.\\" Who talks like that? What's more, McKiernan writes almost all of the dialogue in \\"ye olde fantasye\\" language, derived from old English, with lots of \\"mayhaps\\" and \\"nonces,\\" but sprinkles it with random French words like \\"fille\\" and \\"bonjour.\\" It's enough to make your head spin. There's also a seemingly random sprinkling of dragons, dwarves, undying fey, wee folk (\\"wee\\" is not a French word), serpent-men and goblins. Same ol' same ol', but in a retelling, that's okay in moderation.<br />Thankfully McKiernan's tendency to dwell on insignificant details of travelling was pretty much nowhere to be found, although quite a few not-so-insignificant details in the bedroom are included. The preaching is also toned down, but I don't particularly want to hear about McKiernan's views on virginity. One irritating tendency that was also in \\"Caverns of Socrates\\" is that McKiernan copies stuff from his own Mithgar books -- the serpent-horses, for example, and the \\"lynx riders.\\" (Nothing like Fox Riders, right?) And as some of what he lifted (the serpent-horses/helsteeds) was also lifted from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, it becomes especially weird.<br />Camille is pretty annoying: sweet, innocent, adoring, pure of heart, gorgeous, golden-haired, and essentially perfect in every way. In other words, cloying and sugary. She cries, she weeps, she collapses, she's constantly being rescued by the bear or big strong men (or sometimes tiny strong men). Alain is similarly perfect, angsty and tormented and of course, incredibly handsome. And similarly boring. The supporting characters are all pretty dull, especially Camille's money-obsessed mother and man-obsessed sisters, and the Galadriel-like Lady of the Bower. Only her brother Giles and Scruff the sparrow are endearing. It certainly says something when a bird has more appeal (and mental power) than either of the lead characters.<br />If you really, really like retellings of fairy tales or old stories, then this might appeal to you... or if you are looking for a doe-eyed, imperiled heroine to mock.

Her first two books, \\"The Ill-Made Mute\\" and \\"Lady of the Sorrows,\\" were both lushly written and exquisitely plotted, taking legend and myth and weaving them together in a unique fantasy world. Now she brings her story to a climax in \\"The Battle of Evernight.\\" Too bad the finale just doesn't work.<br /><br />Found mute, scarred and unable to remember anything in the first book, Tahquil has regained her face, her voice, and much of her memory (not to mention her true love, Thorn, who also happens to be the king). But her murky past is connected with the sinister forces that have now scattered the people she knows and cares for.<br /><br />Now she and two companions are stranded in a wilderness, and in Erith that isn't a good thing -- there are many wights, both seelie and unseelie, that lurk across the land. As they travel to the Gate of Oblivion's Kiss, in an effort to right the ever-worsening problems, the Raven Prince Morragan captures them -- and the war grows even worse as Tahquil discovers a shocking secret.<br /><br />One of the nice things about the Bitterbynde trilogy is how unique it is. This is not one of those hack fantasy books where you constantly think, \\"Oh, in a few pages he'll do this.\\" I remember being stunned at her use of the Pied Piper legend in \\"Lady,\\" and even more stunned at how well she used it. Her use of other, more obscure legends is equally fantastic, as is her way of using the various wights.<br /><br />As always, Dart-Thornton's prose is reminiscent of Patricia McKillip's: Lush, detailed, dreamy and lyrical. She goes a little overboard at times (usually about clothing), but mostly it just adds to the mystical atmosphere of the book. Some readers might be offput by her use of large, obscure words that may require a trip to the dictionary, but they don't really detract from the enjoyability of the story. The dialogue, while old-feeling, never lapses into the cliched \\"ye olde fantasye\\" that so many books are afflicted with; you can actually imagine people speaking like this.<br /><br />Tahquil has come a long way, baby. First seen as a voiceless, almost mindless drudge in \\"Mute,\\" she continues to blossom in this book as she gains more knowledge and ability. And her wrenching choice is exquisitely drawn. Caitri and Viviana serve as good accompaniment to Tahquil. Thorn, the mysterious ranger-turned-out-to-be-King of the first and second books, reveals new hidden facets that will stun readers.<br /><br />The downside of this book? It feels like Dart-Thorntn doesn't know how to end the story, so she tries to have her cake and eat it too -- as a result, it feels like an incomplete mass of plot threads. A cop out.<br /><br />As before, Cecilia Dart-Thornton provides a gorgeous fantasy tale of good and evil, seelie and unseelie magic, legend and myth. It's a gorgeous story, to be savored slowly rather than rushed through -- and it's too bad the ending doesn't measure upany books are afflicted with; you can actually imagine people speaking like this.

It has some interesting and original points, but overall I kept ticking off what I had seen before.<br />The Black Foxes are a group of pals who are getting together again for a unique reason: The ultimate D&D game, a VR experience controlled by the A.I. computer Avery. When put into the fictional fantasy world of Itheria, the Black Foxes will not only act out the adventures, but they will actually BELIEVE that they are who they are playing. For them, reality would cease to exist until they emerge from the computer.<br />At first, things go smoothly: the Black Foxes are turned into a generic fantasy group (elven syldari, healer, thief, warrior, pathfinder), who are trying to destroy a teeny indestructible gem that contains the powers of evil. Specifically, the powers of the DemonQueen Atraxia, who is now bringing evil beasties into Itheria. And on the outside, things begin to go dramaticallly wrong when an electrical storm sends the compound into chaos... and Avery decides that he wants to start winning against the Black Foxes.<br />Like the Mithgar books, the overall feeling I got from \\"Caverns of Socrates\\" was: I've seen this before, and I liked it better the first time. There are evil computers, VR gamers trapped in a D&D world, elves and wizards and demons, and the fantasy story itself (indestructable evil object, that contains powers of the supremely evil person, must be destroyed by valiant heroes) is pretty much identical in its description to \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" That in itself isn't so much of a problem in a D&D game, but things like demonsteeds and skelga are virtually identical to elements from the Mithgar books, which in themselves are derivative of \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" I've never heard of anyone imitating elements from their own works, that they copied from someone else's. Some of the elements in it (such as gaining powers from a computer, and the idea of losing one's real identity in the game) are unusual and well-done, but the less original elements kind of choke them out.<br />The first hundred pages are more or less dead boring. Readers will be itching for the Black Foxes to get moving already, but they won't -- they'll sit, philosophize, and engage in long bouts of technobabble that people won't understand. His \\"ye old fantasye\\" language seeps into the futuristic setting, so there is a lot of head-canting and flying eyebrows and so on. The dialogue is uneven, since the fantasy alter-egos go from speaking in ye old fantasye to speaking in modern English.<br />One of the most problematic elements of the book is the characters -- they have a sort of generic appeal, but unfortunately they sort of blend together when they are in the game. They don't act like themselves, so it's a little hard to get attached to them. And I don't see much of a reason for Eric and Alice to be in love, except that all of McKiernan's stories include a romance of some type. This one adds nothing to the plot, but it is written more agreeably than most of what he's done.<br />\\"Caverns of Socrates,\\" if it were cleaned up of the ye olde fantasye language and the endless technobabbling, might have been a pleasant guilty pleasure. But the derivative elements were too much, and the fact that I could predict half the plot events made it even worse. Not too horrible, but weirdly unappealing.se's.

But it isn't just cute -- the characters are pleasantly well-rounded and likable, and while Coupland's books often have a sort of sad feeling, this one is relatively cheerful. Even so, while pointing out the problems with a geek's life, he shows that they're people too, and the poignant moments are among the best in the book.<br />Geek pride! I enjoyed reading about the \\"Microserfs,\\" a unique facet of Douglas Coupland's vision of the world. Entertaining, geeky, and thought-provoking in little spurts.	2003-04-08

At the age of sixty-eight, he met the beautiful and vivacious Marta Abba, a lovely young actress. Though he was old enough to be her father, Pirandello fell in love with Marta, and she remained his muse, his confidante, and his emotional focus.<br />His letters reveal the many facets of his personality. Some readers might be a little weirded out by the intensity of his feelings for Marta (especially since she never entirely returned them), but many years in the future it's clear that even if she didn't exactly return his feelings, she did care about him, liked him, respected him, and appreciated his feelings about her. &quot;To me he was like a god,&quot; she is quoted as saying, even though she got to see all his flaws. And Pirandello's feelings are not those of a dirty old man falling for a much younger woman -- he's revealed, even in old age, as being a very passionate and intense person.<br />In his letters, he often talks about making her a famous actress, and how the two of them would reform the theatre. The foreword written by Benito Ortolani includes his descriptions of meeting Marta herself, in the 1980s, and what she had to say about &quot;the Maestro.&quot; Unfortunately there aren't any pictures.<br />The relationship between Pirandello and Marta was a unique one, a mishmash of unusual feelings. Definitely worth the read.	2003-04-08

When Fergie and Johnny try to investigate his weird behavior (including sand on his carpet and talking to himself), they find the professor having a conversation with Brewster, a magical Egyptian statue. He admits his secret: Behind a bricked-up wall is a time-travelling trolley. And the boys hitch a ride when Childermass travels back in time to save the city of Constantinople from invasion.<br /><br />The problem? They arrive a little too late, and the city is being overrun by Turkish soldiers. As they struggle to make their way back to the trolley and the safety of the future, they encounter the trolley's creator (who accidently got left behind during one of its previous excursions), a deranged monk, and a group of ghostly Crusaders. But then Johnny is poisoned, and the only cure means going back to Constantinople -- and back into danger.<br /><br />Usually time travel books are full of cliches, and this one has a few, but you probably won't notice them. Kids who read this book may become interested in the Byzantine Empire -- while Bellairs doesn't present huge amounts of historical detail, he gives enough to be very, very interesting. (There's also a dash of Egyptian stuff too) There's adventure, humor and the odd way of getting around.<br /><br />Johnny and Fergie remain the surprisingly courageous duo of previous books, the shy boy and his brasher, jokier pal. Professor Childermass is crusty, sometimes a bit irrational, but very lovable. And Brewster (a deity of Upper and Lower Egypt) really steals the show with his dry little comments. .<br /><br />This book proably has one of the lowest amounts of supernatural stuff of Bellairs' books. Certainly it doesn't have much in the way of horror. But there is a great twist about halfway through, where our heroes are aided by a group of ghostly Crusaders, who are trying to make amends for sacking the city centuries before. I suppose Brewster technically counts as supernatural, and he provides a lot of the humor (such as translating a Turkish soldier's words as \\"Butter and eggs, and a pound of cheese!\\").<br /><br />\\"Trolley To Yesterday\\" isn't Bellairs' best novel, but it is an intriguing and informative historical book that adults may enjoy as well, especially if they're Byzantine buffs. Good fun.pernatural stuff of Bellairs' books. Certainly it doesn't have much in the way of horror.

Children have vivid imaginations, and the weird fantasies of a child are some of the most striking that a person can have. Ian McEwan's \\"Daydreamer\\" is one of those rare novels that kids and adults will enoy, though for very different reasons.<br />Ten-year-old Peter Fortune is supposedly a \\"difficult\\" boy, even though he's well-behaved and kind. That's only because he's a quiet loner -- he doesn't mind being around other people, but he prefers to withdraw into his vivid daydreams. When he and his sister fight and he receives his own room, an evil doll leads the other dolls to attack him. When an elderly cat is bullied by a younger cat, Peter becomes the cat for a day. He rubs vanishing cream on his family. He switches bodies with Kenneth, a wobbly toddler who tries to eat everything. He encounters a mystery burglar who has been robbing houses on his street. And he dreams of being an adult.<br />McEwan's books are usually much darker than \\"Daydreamer,\\" but this book doesn't seem lightweight or dumbed-down. It's less like a novel than a series of seven interconnected short stories, each focusing on Peter and how reality shapes his daydreams. McEwan's writing is dreamy but realistic, and often very funny (such as Peter's reaction when he finds himself in Kenneth's baby body).<br />There's nothing objectionable in this book, and McEwan tinges the few frightening images with humor (when the dolls pull off one of Peter's limbs, he yells, \\"Hey, give those back!\\"). Kids will probably enjoy reading about Peter's daydreams, especially if they imagine such vivid things themselves. And adults may like getting a glimpse back in time of when they were able to dream that way. Peter has the purity of a child, knowing that a cat has a soul and feeling sorry for a bully he reduced to tears.<br />If you ever had weird, now-seeming-ridiculous fantasies (or if you still do -- not everybody stops!), then this book will bring a smile to your face.	2003-04-03

While Danny Fields gives a fair outline of the strong, intelligent Linda McCartney's life, the book itself is fluffy, lightweight, poorly written and veers constantly away from Linda. What's the point of having a biography about somebody if half the book isn't written about them?<br />Linda Eastman was born into an affluent New York family, and took up photography after the demise of her first marriage. She became a prominent rock photographer, hung out with rock stars and cutting-edge artists, and married the famous Beatle Paul McCartney. After the breakup of the Beatles they created more music, had children, and remained in love until her untimely death.<br /><br />The unforgivable thing about this book is that I never felt, through it, that I knew much about Linda as a person. Oh, we hear plenty about how she dressed, her romantic liaisons, her job -- but we don't hear much about her. It's especially striking since Fields, the coauthor of the putrid \\"Dream On,\\" keeps reminding the readers that he knew Linda, he knew the McCartneys, he includes photographs of himself posing with them, and so on and so on.<br /><br />His writing style is truly annoying. Often he presents speculation as fact, and will latch on to insignificant details (such as Paul's Passover/Easter joke) as if they were immensely important. He seems to be trying to be chatty, but he only ends up sounding stupid. (\\"It was the best of times, it was the best of times\\"; \\"Bill was, er, pleasant\\") And enough with the leering, Fields. Brian Jones is mentioned three times in passing, but the only real comment on him is, \\"... if something that takes place in a phone booth in under eight minutes can be described as an affair.\\" Why did he mention that? It has nothing to do with Linda, nor do the details of Jones's sex life add anything to the book.<br /><br />Perhaps the most annoying thing is the self-promotion, and not just Fields saying every other page that he knew Linda. I got the feeling at times that Fields wants to write some kind of sixties journalism manifesto, but knows it wouldn't sell. He frequently interrupts the information about Linda to talk about himself, his job, what he thought of sixties rock journalism. He devotes an entire paragraph to talking about the word \\"canoodling.\\"<br /><br />Linda herself was a fantastic, strong and intelligent woman who took a lot of undeserved abuse. Hopefully, somebody will write an insightful bio about her. But Danny Fields did as well on this bio as he did in \\"Dream On\\" -- in other words, it stinks.wants to write some kind of sixties journalism manifesto, but knows it wouldn't sell.

Tolkien's works (which the Chronicles resemble, in their depth and use of mythology). Now Michael Tunnell's guide to the Prydain Chronicles has been rereleased, and it's definitely worth getting.<br />It's in the form of an encyclopedia, with careful, detailed and well-cited entries for everything in Prydain. A lot of the entries include quotations from the books. What's more, Tunnell has done extensive research into the Mabinogion and other Celtic tales. As a result, the entries for characters like Math son of Mathonwy, Gwydion, Achren, the three witches of Morva, and many others include details about the mythological characters, adventures and legends that helped inspire the Chronicles. No character, however minor is denied attention to their mythical backgrounds.<br />Aside from the content, this edition of the \\"Companion\\" is great. Henry Holt has rereleased the entire Chronicles series, and the \\"Companion\\" doesn't disappoint; it matches all the other hardcovers. The binding is good, the paper is nice, and the cover is glossy. While I wasn't too crazy about the colors in the cover illustration, the illustration is very well-done. Alexander has also provided a foreword in hich he praises Tunnell's work.<br />This book (more than just an encyclopedia) is an invaluable tool for fans of the Prydain Chronicles and/or Welsh mythology. Fans of the book series should run to pick this up, and if you haven't read the novels, then do so and THEN pick this book up.	2003-04-02

The surreal sequel to Jasper Fforde's fantastic &quot;Eyre Affair&quot; serves up more of the same, only more polished this time.<br />The newly-wed Thursday Next is drowning in the publicity after her showdown with Acheron Hades and the fateful changing of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;'s finale. Her consolations are her new husband Landen, her dodo Pickwick, and the fact that she's going to be a mum (yes, you read that correctly). But bizarre things start to happen (&quot;Something's going to happen, and I'm part of it&quot;), including telepathic footnotes from her fictional defense attorney.<br />When Thursday ventures onto a Skyrail, time twists after a Neanderthal pilot steers it in an effort to go to Goliath Corp. and her dad appears long enough to warn her about the impending potential destruction of the world (everything is going to turn into goo --literally). Worse, when Thursday returns home, she finds that Landen isn't there. Even worse, he's not there because of a fatal drowning incident at the age of two. And if she wants to return things to how they should be, she'll have to<br />encounter the Cheshire Cat (or more correctly, the &quot;Unitary Authority of Warrington Cat&quot;), venture into her memories, and be apprenticed to Miss Havisham...<br />Fforde gives even more dimension to his alternate universe (including a mention of our own), showing that he still has plenty of turf left to cover. First there were dodos, and now there is also a dreamy mammoth and a Tasmanian tiger. Fforde also gives us a race of reanimated Neanderthals, who are treated as more intelligent animals, and gives us an intriguing, delicately-done look at human nature. But it's also extremely funny, including the discovery of a lost Shakespearean play, Molecular Unstable Brie, the condition of Xplkqulkiccasia, the renamed Cheshire Cat, and Thursday's stint on a talk show where nobody lets her talk about the work that made her famous.<br />Thursday is still hard-boiled and tough, but she gets a little more vulnerable now that she's married, so some readers might find her edge a bit gone. Landen is nice enough, although he's in relatively little of the book; Akrid Snell (Acrid Smell?) of an mystery series is entertaining as the footnote-speaking attorney who won't tell Thursday why she's on trial. There are also appearances (some brief, some not) by Acheron Hades (well, sort of), Uncle Myles, Spike, Pickwick the Dodo, and others.<br />Fforde's writing has become a little more polished since &quot;Eyre Affair,&quot; and the book flows a little more smoothly (especially when it needs to be weird or surreal). The dialogue is still funny and snappy, full of literary in-jokes and weird twists, but it grows more serious about halfway through.<br />&quot;Lost In A Good Book&quot; is amusing and literate, like &quot;Eyre Affair.&quot; And Fforde's literate little world has plenty of promise for future books.Xplkqulkiccasia, the renamed Cheshire Cat, and Thursday's stint on a talk show where nobody lets her talk about the work that made her famous.<br />Thursday is still hard-boiled and tough, but she gets a little more vulnerable now that she's married, so some readers might find her edge a bit gone.

But now she's fourteen, and is the oldest girl to not yet have gained the Sight. After contemplating suicide, Lirael is assigned to work in the library. She inadvertantly sets loose a hideous Free Magic creature, a Stilken that will call other Free Magic creatures and destroy the Clayr. Desperate to deal with her mistake, Lirael calls up the Disreputable Dog (somehow made both of Free and Charter Magic) and soon ends up finding out more about her past -- and her future.<br />Elsewhere, Sabriel's son Sameth is pursued by the Dead, and is almost killed in the process; the only thing he gets for his trouble is a threat from a mysterious necromancer. Sam is supposed to be the future Abhorsen, but the problem is that he's petrified by the things his mother handles easily. And he's helped loose Free Magic on a world increasingly torn by a mysterious masked necromancer...<br />Nix takes the rich world he created in \\"Sabriel\\" and makes it even richer. It's a bit like a melding of typical high fantasy with an early twentieth-century setting (phones, buses, cricket matches, electricity, guns). Old faves like Sabriel, Touchstone, and Mogget appear here (although Mogget's appearance is a bit brief), along with new and equally likable characters.<br />Some readers may not like Lirael as well as they liked the more self-assured, kick-butt Sabriel, but Lirael is in a vastly different position. Sabriel knew who she was, where she was coming from, and knew what she needed to know, while Lirael is only learning those things. She becomes stronger and more self-assured as she learns more about Charter magery and her background. The Disreputable Dog is a lot like Mogget, in that she's more than she seems and a handy source of info, but not as quietly menacing as Mogget was. Sam is endearingly unsure of himself, and is one of the few fantasy characters to be genuinely terrified of his \\"duties,\\" not just apprehensive. His sister was the one character who fell flat; she seemed a little too \\"bossy princess.\\"<br />\\"Lirael\\" has the same balance of humor and horror as the first book. We have things like the bodies of refugees being turned into decayed Dead Hands, the clawed insecto-human Stilken, or just the aura of darkness around the Book of the Dead. But we also have funny things like Nick or the running joke about the Dog and food.<br />The biggest problem with \\"Lirael: Daughter of the Clayr\\" is that it ends on a \\"to be continued\\" note. So be sure to have the concluding novel, \\"Abhorsen,\\" ready while you read this book.

And Dave Barry is quite willing to remind you why moving is such a hideous experience, and why if you ever get the urge to do it again, you should lock yourself in a broom closet until your fit of insanity passes.<br />Among other things, Dave explains why your furniture takes so long to arrive (it involves primitive harvesters in the jungle) and why you will hate it when it arrives; what is and is not a good neighborhood (&quot;I [heart] my Pit Bull&quot; is bad); the horrifying thing called a mortgage; home repair and why you should not do it yourself; making enemies with your neighbors and their big savage dogs; garage sales; moving stuff out of your old house (&quot;Tropical fish should be individually wadded up in newspaper&quot;) and into your new house (&quot;... which will give your possessions an opportunity to scurry, giggling, back out to the truck so that you may carry them inside again&quot;).<br />Basically, if the idea of moving doesn't scare you before you read the book, it definitely will afterwards. Dave explains in horribly, humorously accurate descriptions, just what will happen when you try to move from one house to another. His viewpoint is only warped by the bizarre mindset of one who has tried to move and is still scarred by the experience.<br />So if you ever look around your house and think that you need more space, or a chance of scenery, have the doctor prescribe you something.

Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot? No, it's a slightly different Arthurian tale, and one that mainly focuses on the musically-inclined Sir Dinadin, who never wanted to be a knight anyway.<br />Dinadin has always wanted to be a minstrel (especially since his older brother Tristam is a valiant knight), but his father knights him in a drunken stupor and sends him off. After dispatching the knight of a treacherous damsel, Dinadin joins up with a rather dim Welsh knight, Culloch, and ends up at Arthur's court of Camelot. Then he goes off with Culloch, Kai and Bedivere to do knightly things -- including freeing a sharp-tongued lady-in-waiting called Brangienne and Culloch's attempts to win a rather unattractive princess.<br />Along the way, Dinadin learns that Brangienne is fleeing Queen Iseult, because she knows that Iseult is in love with Tristam, who is wandering around, having taken a vow of silence and unwilling to shut up about it. He also won't shut up about Iseult, with the result that everybody except her husband knows about them. Dinadin teams up with the noble Moor Palomides (who wants to learn what knights are), as Brangienne's safety is jeopardized, and the not-so-secret affair between Tristam and Iseult comes to a dramatic peak.<br />Morris takes a skip back in time for this book -- it takes place parallel to \\"The Squire, His Knight And His Lady\\" and \\"The Savage Damsel And the Dwarf,\\" though the overlap is only about two paragraphs long.  And he handles this story very well and very deftly -- Dinadin doesn't want to become a knight, and he doesn't really have conventional aptitude for it. He'd rather stay home and play his rebec. But his cleverness and ingenuity are what make him a good knight, above and beyond being able to whack things with a sword.<br />Dinadin is as likable a hero as Morris has penned before, not your typical knight but a solid and admirable one instead. Palomides serves as a good foil, searching for the English ideal knight and finding it where he doesn't expect to; Brangienne is very like Eileen, very witty and smart. Iseult and Tristam are pretty pitiful, and I'm not just talking about the nauseatingly-named \\"Love Grotto.\\" Tristam thinks he's nothing without a lady to serve, and Iseult is just... well, she's just a lisping ditz with a crazy husband.<br />As with all his books, there is plenty of humor in this story, ranging from horribly-written ballads to a magical drinking horn to the worst wedding ceremony in history. (Not to mention Kai repeating the ballad line: \\"Jug jug witta poo poo\\") It gets a bit more serious near the end, but overall it's much more lighthearted than Morris's fourth Arthurian tale, \\"Parsifal's Page.\\"<br />Fans of Morris will definitely like \\"The Ballad of Sir Dinadin.\\" (Or Sir Dumbledin... Dimbledum... Dinderlin... oh bugger it...) Giving a new twist on the tale of Iseult and Tristam, Morris lets the spotlight shine on the unlikely and capable Dinadin.Palomides serves as a good foil, searching for the English ideal knight and finding it where he doesn't expect to; Brangienne is very like Eileen, very witty and smart.

But what is not widely-known about him is that he also fought in World War I, of which his experiences are recorded in \\"Tales of War.\\"<br />\\"Prayer of the Men of Daleswood\\" is unusual for Dunsany, in that it is entirely composed of a monologue about a village called Daleswood. \\"Road\\" is a touching story about the \\"road\\" to peace that the men killed in the war had made. \\"Imperial Monument\\" reflects on the lasting effects of the war on France, Germany, and others. \\"Walk to the Trenches\\" is a meditative examination of the landscape around the trenches. \\"Walk in Picardy\\" offers a look into the trek of a soldier into the trenches. \\"What Happened on the Night of the Twenty-Seventh\\" is a story about Dick Cheeser, a pleasantly ordinary English boy who has his first night as a sentry. \\"Standing To\\" is about the dawn on the battlefield. \\"Splendid Traveller\\" hints at fantasy, the story of a British airman. \\"England\\" is a solid little dialogue-driven tale where a Private and a Sargeant have a talk about sausages, gardens, and other things in England. \\"Shells\\" is Dunsany's description of German guns and shells; there is something almost alarmingly clinical about this essay, until the final paragraph. \\"Two Degrees of Envy\\" is a unique story, about two unfortunate men -- one English, one German -- who are envied by their former comrades. \\"Master of No Man's Land\\" is a mildly humorous story about a rutabaga.<br />\\"Weeds and Wire\\" is a rather sad story about English soldiers wandering through the ruins of a French village. \\"Spring in England and Flanders\\" reflects on two different springs in two different countries -- one intact, one a wasteland. \\"Nightmare Countries\\" is a reflection on the hideous condition of WWI France. \\"Spring and the Kaiser\\" sadly reflects on how the German leaders weren't happy with simple, peaceful contentment. \\"Two Songs\\" is about mirrored events in both England and France. \\"Punishment\\" is a haunting, Dickensian story about a phantom who takes the Kaiser on a tour of the homes that he has destroyed. \\"English Spirit\\" is about Cane, a man who has been to war and doesn't want to go again. \\"An Investigation Into the Causes and Origin of the War\\" is about the \\"imperial barber... that eccentric man whose name so few remember.\\" \\"Lost\\" is about the last chance of Hitler for redemption. \\"Last Mirage\\" is a poetic look at how France is a \\"desert\\" for the Nazis. \\"Famous Man\\" is about an unnamed, famous personage (Churchill?) who visits after World War I. \\"Oases of Death\\" is about tiny gravesites that are left green. \\"Anglo-Saxon Tyranny\\" is a reflection on American and English sea-power. \\"Memories\\" is a reflection on Ireland in the first World War. \\"Movement\\" is a story about a weird crank in England, who becomes very vocal upon the beginning of the war. \\"Nature's Cad\\" is a rather weird story about a gorilla. \\"Home of Herr Schnitzelhaaser\\" is a saddening story about an old man, an old woman, and their pig. \\"Deed of Mercy\\" is a demonstration about how even evil people can give acts of mercy. \\"Last Scene of All\\" is a saddening story about a dying man and what he sees. \\"Old England\\" is a fitting finale to the collection, in which old John Plowman thinks about the men injured in the war.<br />Though the events of this book are either real or set in real situations, there is a vague sense of unreality in almost all of them. Only a few don't display Dunsany's dreamy prose, such as \\"Prayer\\" and \\"England,\\" which have a solidly English feel to the dialogue and descriptions. The overall feeling of \\"Tales\\" is not anger or fear, but simply a sadness that all those people were killed, and the devastating effects on the countrypeople of both allies and enemies alike in the future. At the same time, like J.R.R. Tolkien, he shows good insight into the ordinary guys who were called from peaceful country homes to fight.<br />For some G-rated insight into the minds of the soldiers in the World Wars, this is a unique and interesting collection of stories and essays.<br />For some G-rated insight into the minds of the soldiers in the World Wars, this is a unique and interesting collection of stories and essays.	2003-03-29

It needs a bit of tightening in areas, but overall quite nice.<br />Sanders has just moved into a very old house with his father, sister and self-absorbed mother, and nobody except his mother is happy about it. Sanders deals with this by wandering off into the woiods by himself, where he meets an Algonquin girl, Mini, and a goat-boy named Billy. And he catches sight of a Hessian soldier racing by, the ghost of a young man who leaped to his death centuries before. But the ghost isn't the only supernatural thing lurking around. The pleasant, peaceful dwarf Alfar is being instructed in wickedness and mischief by his ruthless grandfather, Dwerg, Lord of the Dunderberg, who is trying to whip him into a suitable Black Dwarf.<br />But mere mischief (putting bees in Sanders's attic) escalates when Dwerg decides that Alfar should marry Mini, the descendant of the people who killed Alfar's parents. Neither Mini or Alfar like the idea, and after Sanders saves Alfar's life, they set out to oust Dwerg, even though Alfar's magic isn't up to the task. Along the way they will run into eternally-sailing pirates, a dwarf-created storm, and finally the Lord of the Dunderberg himself.<br />Hassinger does a good job with \\"Book of Alfar\\"; in some ways it's a fairly typical fantasy, but has some nice quirks like the usage of real mythology in the storyline. (I was a little distracted by the fact that \\"Dwerg\\" means dwarf, and \\"Alfar\\" means elves) The usage of things like American history, a dramatic backdrop, and the pirates who will sail forever are good touches.<br />Sanders is the best-fleshed-out character in the book, a likeable kid who rises to the challenges; Mini is like a less intriguing Lloyd Alexander heroine, and I'm not sure why Billy was in the book. I like him, but I didn't think he added much to the plot. Sanders's family is quite well done, and Dwerg just avoids being cartoonish. Oh yes, and his wight-cloak is quite entertaining.<br />There are a few flaws; the good guys all become pals almost instantly, rather than a getting-to-know-you period. Occasionally Alfar seems a bit too much like a human being. Hassinger's writing style is brisk, not very detailed, but quite a few parts of it become very intense and poetic, such as the \\"granddaughter\\" scene on the pirates' ship.<br />It's a pretty good fantasy story, with a few flaws but some unique usage of history and legend make it above average.

His characters are very vivid and believable, the writing is solid, and Tolkien keeps unexpected twists in the evidence so that you won't be able to figure out entirely what is going on, or how the case will be resolved.<br />Young Thomas Robinson sees his mother Anne brutally murdered by a pair of men named Rosie and Lonnie (he would have been killed too if his mother hadn't hidden him). What's more, he now says that he saw his stepmother Greta talking with Rosie, but his father Peter Robinson claims that his son is lying. A seductive social-climber who tempted the son and married the father, Greta claims that the sensitive boy is trying to blame her for the breakup of his parents' marriage.<br />Now, a much-publicized murder investigation is underway. Thomas, his best pal, the housekeeper, and a few other witnesses are called to testify about the evidence about Anne's death, including a questionable first name, a dead dog, a stolen locket, a gate left open, and Thomas's vivid imagination.  As the case progresses, the testimonies start to break down. Is the secretive Greta a murderer? Has Thomas made a mistake? And what will the \\"final witness\\" tell the court?<br />Like his world-famous grandfather, Simon Tolkien writes about what he knows. While J.R.R. Tolkien's job and writing centered on language and legends, Simon Tolkien is a barrister in London. So it only makes sense that he wrote a legal thriller, and a good one too. (It also gives me extra respect for him as a writer and person, because some people would have just tried to cash in on the family name) Aside from the [love] content (which, while fitting for Greta and her effect on Peter and Thomas, is a little more than I'd like), this is a great book. Certainly head-and-shoulders above Grisham and similar writers.<br />Tolkien's writing is solid and detailed; he has a very you-are-there feel to his book. He's at his best in the courtroom scenes, which are the tensest parts of the book. I got cold chills reading those parts.  His descriptions of things like the \\"yellow dress\\" incident, the wind in the trees, a crowded house or a creepy courthouse are astounding.<br />Thomas is the most likeable person in the book, very imaginative and sweet-natured. His father Peter is clearly experiencing doubts about Greta, but insists she's innocent less out of thought than wishing. The rigidly feudal housekeeper and rather fluttery pal Matthew are strong supporting characters. But where Tolkien really strikes gold is Greta: We see that she can be very sultry, nasty, and certainly we can imagine her killing someone (whether or not she did). But he gives the readers insights into her life and her vulnerabilities, to give her dimension. I hated Greta, but I understood her inside and out. Brilliant.<br />Readers shouldn't expect something as groundbreaking as \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" (On the back cover, Tolkien even talks about his fears about being compared to his grandfather) But if you like a tight, tense, well-plotted and amazingly characterized legal thriller, this is the ticket.

The two first met when they were young children, of about eight. Dante instantly fell in love with her, but didn't really interact with her for several years. Over the years, Dante's almost supernatural love only increased in intensity, and he poured out his feelings (grief, adoration, fear) into several poems and sonnets. During an illness, he has a vision about mortality, himself, and his beloved Beatrice (\\"One day, inevitably, even your most gracious Beatrice must die\\"). Beatrice died at the age of twenty-four, and Dante committed himself to the memory of his muse.<br />I have never in my life read a book overflowing with such incredible love and passion as \\"La Vita Nuova\\"; it's probably the most romantic book I have ever seen. It's only a little over a hundred pages long, but it's a truly unique love story. Dante and Beatrice were never romantically involved. In fact, both of them married other people.<br />But Dante's love for Beatrice shows itself to be more than infatuation or crush, because it never wanes -- in fact, it grows even stronger, including Love manifested as a nobleman in one of Dante's dreams. There is no element of physicality to the passion in \\"La Vita Nuova\\"; Dante talks about how beautiful Beatrice is, but that's only a sidenote. (We don't hear of any real details about her) And Dante's grief-stricken state when Beatrice dies (of what, we're never told) leads him to deep changes in his soul, and eventually peace. (And though Beatrice died, because of Dante's love for her and her placement in the \\"Comedia,\\" she has achieved a kind of immortality)<br />One of the noticeable things about this book is that whenever something significant happens to Dante (good, bad, or neither), he immediately writes a poem about it. Some readers may be tempted to skip over the carefully constructed poems, but they shouldn't. Even if these intrude on the story, they show what Dante was feeling more clearly than his prose.<br />It's impossible to read this book and come out of it jaded about love or true passion. Not the sort of stuff in pulp romance novels, but love and passion that come straight from the heart and soul, in a unique and unusual love story. Every true romantic should read this book.ty)<br />One of the noticeable things about this book is that whenever something significant happens to Dante (good, bad, or neither), he immediately writes a poem about it.

Hoeg did a fantastic job with this.<br />They are the \\"borderliners\\": Children who don't fit in, be it for not being smart enough, for having difficulties with others, or just failing to slip into the slots that society has for them. Fourteen-year-old Peter has been in institutions of one sort or another all his life, partly because of his lack of \\"normality,\\" and is now going to the creepy Biehl's Academy where the \\"borderline\\" children mingle with the privileged kids, in obsessively strict surroundings.<br />There, Peter encounters the wise orphan Katarina, who saw her parents both die -- her mother of cancer, stretching out every second of the last months of her life, and her grieving father, who tried to speed time up. And there's August, a strangely sinister child who harbors a dark secret in his past. The three grow closer, Peter falls for Katarina, and they begin struggling to break free of the strange experiments in social Darwinism being performed at the school.<br />Given the name of the lead character -- Peter Hoeg -- I can only assume that this is at least partly autobiographical. That may be why the book is so moving and personal-feeling. Like \\"Danish Dreams,\\" this book contains a lot of surreal philosophy about time, about how people try to either use or avoid the passage of time. This occasionally stops the book dead, but if you can handle that then it won't be a problem.<br />The book is haunting and eerie, almost dreamlike. Hoeg doesn't overburden the story with too much detail. For example, when Peter and Katarina kiss for the first time, he doesn't describe it -- instead he describes the impact it has on Peter. And the dialogue is just as haunting: \\"What about the darkness inside people?\\" \\"The light will disperse it.\\" \\"There's not that much light in the entire world.\\"<br />I could tell that Peter comes from Hoeg's heart, because he's so vivid in his feelings and responses. Katarina is incredibly smart and cool-headed, with thoughts beyond her years; August is both appealing and frightening, since he can be lost or violent at any given time. The supporting characters are all vivid and well-drawn, whether they are bad or good. The Academy itself has an aura of almost horrific control, an amazingly well-written place.<br />Peter Hoeg is a master storyteller, and \\"Borderliners\\" is a book that stuck in my mind for days after I had read it.

(Not to mention his many sonnets) But this rather thin, fluffy book of quotations about love won't really satisfy the Shakespeare buffs out there.<br />It covers romantic love -- in sonnets and quotations -- love in song (\\"A hey and a ho and a hey nonino\\"), humorous love (like the kiss in \\"Taming of the Shrew\\" that was heard all over the church), sonnets that make comparisons to summer's days, and so forth.<br />The problem with the text is that there isn't much of it. It's a short book to begin with, and there's only one quotation (often an extremely short one) for every two pages. I came out of it wondering why, given the wealth of material, the editor couldn't scrounge a few more slightly more insightful quotes. The pictures are quite pretty, mostly Pre-Raphaelite stuff. Some is based on Shakespeare's work, some isn't; my main problem with them was that they were too small to study carefully.<br />Basically, this book is pretty much for the lovestruck youths who express their feelings through Shakespeare's quotations.

And this fantastic compilation of Howe's artwork, of all kinds, is a wonderful collection of artwork by an immensely talented artist. (And a cute part at the end has photographs of Howe in armor)<br />A great deal of the book is devoted to Middle-Earth and J.R.R. Tolkien's works. There are the creepily reptilian dragons, spiders chasing hobbits, the majestic Elves, several different incarnations of the Balrog and its battle with Gandalf, the black-armored and evil Morgoth, the dwarves dining in Bilbo Baggins' hole, a misty Treebeard, Smaug asleep on his glowing gold, the Dark Tower of Mordor with a hissing Fell Beast in front of it... all sorts of goodies. The pictures come from book covers, book illustrations, game boxes, and so forth.<br />But Howe's artwork is not just for \\"Rings\\" and Middle-Earth. Oh no. There are sketches (uncolored) and previously unpublished artwork. There are illustrations from picture books like \\"Jack and the Beanstalk,\\" \\"Rip Van Winkle,\\" Howe's fascination with armor and Arthuriana, which includes lots of solid horses, armor, and sword-wielding knights; his illustrations for books by Anne McCaffrey, Robin Hobb, Charles de Lint, Guy Gavriel Kay, Jan Siegel, Margaret Weis, a compilation of Merlin-related stories, and much more.<br />Howe's artwork has a lot of variety, and many of them look almost like photographs. While you can tell that they're paintings, they're frozen in one second, often in the middle of an action scene. So you almost expect them to start moving. He uses light and shadow expertly, such as in the pic where we see Smaug on his gold -- under his wings, the golden reflection of his treasure is lighting up his face and scales. Or when he is shown attacking Laketown, where everything is dark and shadowy except the fire.<br />When the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie trilogy was given the go-ahead, Howe (along with Alan Lee, ) was hired by filmmaker Peter Jackson to help with the sets and landscaping and other designs. Now Jackson has written a foreword to this book, in which he talks about what a fan he is of Howe's artwork (and was, even before the movies!), and how his artwork served as a guide of sorts to how certain things should look. (Such as Ian McKellen's \\"Gandalf\\" look, which was based on Howe's famed picture of the wise old wiz) And the afterword was by fellow artist and friend Alan Lee, who describes how they met in New Zealand in 1998, starting work on the movies, and praises Howe for his energy and skill.<br />This is a fantastic read for fans of J.R.R.

1187743:US	50881246	R3NS8GAXZ4QTSD	0345336062	365669094	Smith of Wootton Major & Farmer Giles of Ham	Books	5	15	15	N	N	In the vulgar tongue	While most of his genius went into the world of Middle-Earth and its fantastical history, JRR Tolkien produced a number of smaller stories during his life.<br /><br />Two of the best-known examples: \\"Smith of Wootton Major & Farmer Giles of Ham,\\" which pairs together a beautifully fantastical fable that drips with Tolkien's love of fairy tales.... and a wacky story about a not-very-frightening dragon and the hapless hero who is after him. While these two novellas are very different in style, they have Tolkien's love of mystery and magic, language and humor.<br /><br />\\"Smith of Wootton Major\\" takes place in a little town \\"not very long ago for those with long memories, not very far away fro those with long legs.\\" The Master Cook of that village takes a vacation, and returns with an apprentice in tow. But something odd happens at the Feast of the Cake -- the cook stirs in a \\"fay-star\\" with little trinkets in the cake, and it's accidentally swallowed by a boy there.<br /><br />The boy (later called Smith) is changed by the fay-star, which sparkles on his forehead. When he grows up, Smith ventures into Faery itself, and even meets the Faery Queen herself. The message she gives him is for her mysterious, missing husband, the King -- who turns out to be the last person anybody in Wootton Major would have expected.<br /><br />And in \\"Farmer Giles of Ham,\\" Aegidius de Hammo (or in the \\"vulgar tongue,\\" as Tolkien archly tells us, Farmer Giles of Ham) is a pleasant, not-too-bright farmer (a bit like Barliman Butterbur) who leads a fairly happy, sedate life. Until the day his excitable dog Garm warns him that a giant (deaf and very near-sighted) is stomping through and causing mayhem. Giles takes out his blunderbuss and takes a shot at the giant, and inadverantly drives him off.<br /><br />Naturally, Giles is hailed as a hero. Even the King is impressed, and sends him the sword Caudimordax (vulgar name: Tailbiter), which belonged to a dragonslaying hero. By chance, the not-so-fierce dragon Chrysophylax Dives has started pillaging, destroying and attacking the nearby areas. Can a not-so-heroic farmer drive off a not-so-frightening dragon?<br /><br />While these aren't Tolkien's deepest or most intricate stories, they do show the range of his writing. One is a robust little comedy of fantastical proportions, and one of them is a delicate, crystalline piece of moonlit prettiness. They have almost nothing in common, except that British-country atmosphere that Tolkien brought to every hero's home.<br /><br />Specifically,  \\"Farmer Giles of Ham\\" is wacky and arch, especially since Tolkien expertly blends the whole high fantasy thing with a wicked sense of humour (\\"if it is your notion to go dragonhunting jingling and dingling like Canterbury Bells, it ain't mine\\"). And he has some fun little linguistic jokes woven in, along with the gentle parody of high fantasy cliches that HE CREATED (Caudimordax, a sword which is incapable of being sheathed if a dragon is within five miles of it).<br /><br />\\"Smith of Wootton Major\\" is not humorous, but it is beautiful. His glimpses of Faerieland are too brief, but written with the exquisite, haunting quality of his better-known works (\\"Once in these wanderings he was overtaken by a grey mist and strayed long at a loss, until the mist rolled away and he found that he was in a wide plain\\"). And he gives the impression of a world of magic far greater than any human could grasp (\\"... bearing the white ships that return from battles on the Dark Marches of which men know nothing\\").<br /><br />The characters of \\"Smith\\" are somewhat less developed and memorable, though Smith himself is a fascinating little allegorical figure -- the fairy star is the creative spark, and Smith the one who can see the Fairyland that inspires great art. Farmer Giles is a little easier to like immediately, being a good-hearted, somewhat thick \\"ordinary\\" person with an excitable dog and a rather inoffensive dragon.<br /><br />\\"Smith ofWootton Major & Farmer Giles of Ham\\" pairs together two shining gems of early fantasy -- one an enchanted fable, the other a tongue-in-cheek comedy of errors. For those seeking more Tolkien, these are a must.antasy -- one an enchanted fable, the other a tongue-in-cheek comedy of errors. For those seeking more Tolkien, these are a must.	2003-03-19

The epic movie trilogy \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" was the first exposure to Tolkien's work for a lot of the people who watched it. And the fans who haven't yet read the books should check out this book, to get the tips on who and what and where and why.<br />Basically, this \\"Creatures\\" book lets the readers know: What's a hobbit? What's an Elf? What's an Ent? Readers of the original fantasy trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien will know all of this. On the other hand, newbies will like being able to look these things up -- especially since \\"Two Towers\\" has a lot of new material, with the Ents, Haradrim, Rohirrim, and others. The book is pretty short, and seems even shorter because it is composed mostly of photographs. These are clear, brightly colored, and great shots -- not just of stuff in the movies, but also from stuff behind the scenes.<br />What's especially nice are the quotes. Accompanying many of the smaller photographs are quotes from director Peter Jackson, special-effects wizard Richard Taylor, actors Elijah Wood, Ian Holm, Sean Astin, and pretty much everyone else. These quotes add insights into both the characters (\\"In their world, it's who you are on the inside that matters\\") and behind the scenes (complaints about the hobbit feet, from several actors). One of the best quotes is Peter Jackson revealing how the much-maligned Tom Bombadil almost made a cameo -- fans of the books will want to check that out.<br />Even if you've read the other books, this brief book will offer a few new insights and plenty of good movie and behind-the-scenes pictures.	2003-03-18

Fans of \\"Princess Bride\\" and the works of Craig Shaw Gardner should check this one out.<br />The good and kindly King Olive is dead. Actually, he isn't - he was quietly usurped from his throne by his greasy, incompetent brother Boonder (who likes to put worms on his head). Olive has been held captive for three years in a cell guarded by the horrifying Boneman. All of this is unknown to the farm boy Sam Hatcher, who is sent by his father to become one of the Royal Guard. He doesn't quite make the cut, and is sent to Rigby Skeet, an eccentric but very capable \\"Sword for Hire\\" (who likes cute little rabbits).<br />Sam has only been there a short time when a man carrying the king's \\"Help\\" message staggers in and dies of three arrows. Soon he and Rigby are making a desperate run for the king's prison to set him free, with the brutal King's elite on their tail. Will they free Boonder's unwilling bride, Melinda? Will they make it past a deceptive sorcerer? And will they get Olive from the clutches of the sinister Boneman?<br />\\"Swords for Hire,\\" although it was only just published, was actually written in the late 1970s by a very bright young man, Will Allen, who gave copies of it to his family for Christmas. Sadly, he died of melanoma a few months later. (He closely resembled Sam on the cover) He was a fan of Stephen King, Ray Bradbury, Mark Twain, and particularly the novel \\"Princess Bride\\" (there's a clever homage to it late in the book). It also has a very nice foreword written by Nancy Cartwright, best known as the voice of Bart Simpson (yes, THAT Bart Simpson), who knew Will when they were kids.<br />It's a funny, quick-paced adventure story with lots of fighting, loathsome villains, feisty damsels, underestimated heroes and the occasional gruesome specter. Allen wrote several nice twists on this story: The secret of the Boneman, the growing friendship between Rigby and Sam, the thing about the worms, and the sorcerer who... well, isn't.<br />Sam is a likeable kid in the classic fantasy mold, although thankfully he has a lot more personality than most. Boonder is repellent in every way, especially since he isn't very smart or very menacing; Olive, conversely, is likeably blunt and unbreakable. And Rigby Skeet, a hardened and slightly weird swordsman (he dug an escape route because he was bored, and used it to avoid the neighbors), is the gem of this story.

George MacDonald, the first fantasy master, managed to buck that trend with the sequel to &quot;The Princess and the Goblin,&quot; with &quot;The Princess and Curdie.&quot; If anything, this book is even better than the first -- a bit more mature, a little bit darker, but with the same haunting prose and likeable characters.<br />In the time since the defeat of the goblins, Curdie has gone back to his life as a miner. Unfortunately he also begins to stray from the pure actions he showed in the first book, pushing aside thoughts of Princess Irene's grandmother and trying to convince himself that the more supernatural events of &quot;Goblin&quot; were just imagination. Until he needlessly wounds a pigeon with his bow and arrow, and takes it to the stately, mysterious Grandmother.<br />As Curdie regains his innocence and his faith, the Lady sends him on a quest, with a weird doglike creature called Lina who was once a human. She also (by having him stick his hands into burning roses) makes his hands able to feel a person's soul when he touches them, if a person is &quot;growing into a beast&quot; on the inside. Now Curdie and Lina set off for the capital, where Irene's father is physically ill, and falling prey to the scheming of his sinister officials.<br />If the first book was Irene's, then this book is undeniably Curdie's. The focus is on him almost constantly through the book, and it's his internal struggles that we are fascinated by. Every person (well, most of them, anyway) eventually loses their childlike faith and innocence, as Curdie has begun to do at the beginning. He's naturally a more skeptical person than Irene, and so time begins to fade whatever he thought he saw; also, being &quot;one of the guys&quot; in the mine requires a seemingly more mature attitude. But with the loss of innocence also goes some of the faith and internal beauty, and so MacDonald brings Curdie back to the gentle, trusting kid he was in the first book.<br />The Lady (also known as Irene's great-great-great-grandmother, Lady of the Silver Moon, and Mother Wotherwop -- don't ask about the last one) is also a more prominent figure.

It's got action, a dash of romance, humor, tragedy, and a moral lesson that doesn't beat you over the head. It's not quite perfect, but fairly close to it.<br />Lukas-Kasha is a professional bum, an accomplished slacker, a boy who takes great pride in doing nothing at all. But all that has to change when a strange magician sends him through time and space in a bucket of water. He washes up on a strange beach, and is quickly whisked off to the city of Abadan and is crowned King Kasha. (It was prophecied by the astrologer that the next king would come from the sea)<br />At first, Lukas is fine with this. Then he finds that the sinister vizier Shugdad is using him as a puppet -- and when he rebels, Shugdad plans to do away with him as he did the previous two kings. So Lukas runs away into the desert with a proud slave girl (Nur-Jehan) and a tart-tongued poet (Karim), to get help from the fierce, honorable Bishangaris. But Shugdad still wants to kill Lukas, and will do anything to get control of Abadan.<br />Alexander uses a cultural backdrop to most of his books -- most notably Wales in the Prydain Chronicles, but he also uses China, India, Greece, and so forth. This time, it's the Middle-East; he does an outstanding job of the exotic city of Abadan and the raw wilderness of the desert. There are some outstandingly funny scenes, such as Lukas tricking a merchant out of a horse. And the subplot about Lukas's growing selflessness is an excellent, subtle moral lesson.<br />Lukas is one of Alexander's most likeable heroes. He initially isn't very sympathetic because he is so proudly, insistently lazy, but his untapped decency wins out when he is called on to be a king, or a warrior, a trickster, or a peacemaker. He just needed something to spur him on. Nur-Jehan is flatter than most of Alexander's heroines, because she lacks that special spark that the other heroines do. Karim is likeably acidic, the voice of reason, and the astrologer Lucman is sweet because he simply cannot get his predictions right, until he's scrounging in the streets.<br />It's not Alexander's best, but it's up near the top of the list. \\"The First Two Lives of Lukas-Kasha\\" is definitely worth a read, and definitely a keeper.o.

Tolkien. Now with the release of the live-action movie trilogy, virtually all the Tolkien-related books are being pulled off the shelves and rereleased -- this among them. It's a good, insightful collection of essays, but there's something vital missing...<br />It's a compilation of essays, by various people. Among them are Bonniejean Christensen's<br />study of Gollum in \\"The Hobbit\\" -- there were two versions of the \\"Riddles in the Dark\\"<br />chapter; Walter Scheps's \\"Fairy-Tale Morality of Lord of the Rings,\\" which studies the ethics<br />of Tolkien's trilogy as well as traditional fairy-tales; Agnes Perkins and Helen Hill's essay on<br />power, corruption, the lust for power, and the One Ring; Deborah C. Rogers's study of<br />humanity both in the \\"everyman\\" hobbits and in the noble Aragorn; Robert Plank's study of<br />the Scouring of the Shire and how it reflects fascism; and several others. On the downside, Dorothy Matthews' \\"The Psychological Journey of Bilbo Baggins\\" is okay, but rather off-balance because it explains a hobbit's mind in complex jargon -- those don't go together.<br />But there is a major problem. I was fortunate enough to find a first-edition paperback of this book, from the 1970s, and the last part of it is a special meaning and pronunciation guide by J.R.R. Tolkien himself. It's a wonderful bonus, and worth the price of the book alone. But for some reason, the chapter has been removed from the reprinted \\"Tolkien Compass.\\" It's just essays, no Tolkien -- I'm not sure why it was removed, but it was.<br />\\"Tolkien Compass\\" is a good collection of scholarly essays on various facets of Tolkien's<br />work, which aren't dumbed down but also aren't too hard to understand. If the extra guide chapter had been included, this would have been a reissued treasure. As it is, it seems very incomplete.	2003-03-11

The eerie \\"Fog Horn\\" calls a strange, ancient creature. \\"Tyrannosaurus Rex\\" is involved in filmmaking, and the two poems \\"Lo, the Dear Daft Dinosaurs!\\" and \\"What If I Said, The Dinosaur's Not Dead\\" add a note of whimsy to it.<br />As with all Bradbury story collections, this is a pretty unusual bunch of stories -- there's humor, there's horror (the second story in particular) and dwelling on children in the Midwest with that odd knack he seems to have.  The writing is spare and hard-hitting, and the publisher, ibooks, adds to the entertainment with illustrations. The cover art is the best, very bright and colorful. Inside the text of the stories is often lined with smaller pictures and patterns; the illustrations can be weird and funny, or realistic and almost frightening. The only letdown was Moebius's rather childlike illustrations.<br />If you have a kid who's obsessed by dinosaurs, or ever were one yourself (fess up! Everyone does it!) then this will be a good collection of dinosaur stories to share. And even if you already have this book in another edition, you may want to get it just for the illustrations.	2003-03-09

The Rolling Stones are, though not the best rock band of the 20th century, then certainly one of the the most colorful. And people looking for the basic history of the Stones (up until the year 2001) will find a basic, but well-researched and often insightful book. Not perfect, but pretty good.<br />It chronicles the Stones' rapid ascent into superstardom, and their many problems once they got up there (mostly related to -- I'm sorry, I have to say this -- sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll). There was the doomed Brian Jones and his suspicious death, the beautiful convent-girl-turned-pop-star Marianne Faithfull, the romantic intrigues spurred by the beautiful Anita Pallenberg, the shocking and/or unsuccessful movies, the marriages that didn't last, the legal battles, and so on. It's a long and messy story, and the \\"old gods\\" sure haven't come out of it unscathed.<br />It's undeniable that the Rolling Stones lived a pretty hedonistic life for a long time (the last section of the book is rather plain vanilla, once they clean themselves up), and did some pretty despicable things. However, Stephen Davis fortunately doesn't just show them as rock animals -- they do awful things and good things. He shows a lot of restraint when it comes to the copious tabloid-y material and seedy rumors, and analyzes Stones lyrics for their meanings. In fact, this is one of the more tasteful rock-related books I've read.<br />He also presents the various stones as actual people, good and bad, very flawed but still human.  Using quotes from the Stones, their lovers and ex-lovers and friends, he presents them probably much as they are/were. There's Brian Jones, abuser and \\"breaker of women\\" who is still very pitiful and  downward-spiralling (Davis also deals head-on with what seems to be Jones' murder), as well as the wild Mick Jagger and gravelly Keith Richards, and their girlfriends and wives (almost as important to the group as the guys themsevles) the innocent-looking Marianne Faithfull, the tough and brainy Anita Pallenberg, icy Bianca Jagger and Texan Jerry Hall. Even if you don't LIKE them (such as Jones), you see a lot of stuff that gives insight to them. And Davis challenges some of the long-held opinions about the Stones, insisting that Mick and Keith were incredibly understanding towards Brian, but that Brian was such a mess that nobody could help him.<br />One of the things that did bug me a little was that he seemed to pay too little attention to some of the women, like Jerry Hall, Bianca Jagger, and Patti Hansen. However, he does get kudos for giving the eerily fascinating Anita Pallenberg sufficient attention, especially since (unlike most biographers) he tells us what happened to Anita after she overcame her addictions. Nothing sordid there, and it's very nice to read what she does now. Ditto with Marianne Faithfull, whose chaotic life became even worse over time, only to take an upturn many years later.<br />One of the big flaws with this book is the writing. Most of the time it's quite good, but I got tired of the mini-chapters, and being told repeatedly \\"This was Brian Jones' last American concert/last significant contribution/last public performance/last meal/last audible burp/last song-and-dance-routine\\"... I got a little tired of that. And the prose occasionally becomes a little too flowery for my taste -- this is a rock memoir! The pictures are quite good, mostly focusing on the stones but also including a few shots of their friends and girlfriends. I did wish they'd included a few pictures of the kids, though.<br />It's a pretty good summing-up of the Rolling Stones, taking in almost all of the stretch of their time as a band and their personal AND professional lives. A must-read for the classic rock fan, and possibly an interesting read for anyone who wants to know what was going on then.

McKiernan at his best elicits three stars from me, and this wasn't a three-star book. Preachy, poorly-characterized, and sagging under self-importance, this is a big miss.<br />The comet \\"Eye of the Hunter\\" is a sign that the evil Baron Stoke will be hunted by a certain group. The Warrow Faeril, who is one of the \\"Lastborn Firstborns,\\" seeks and finds the other Lastborn Firstborn, Gwylly Fenn, and the two head off to find the immortal Elf Riatha. Centuries before, Riatha and the ancestors of Gwylly and Faeril tried to hunt down Stoke, and trapped him in a glacier along with the bear-man Urus.<br /><br />They go to the glacier with the Elven ex-mariner Aravan (who is searching for an evil creature that Stoke fits the description of), only to find that Stoke has escaped -- and despite a thousand years, Urus is still alive. The band of shapeshifters, Warrows and Elves sets off across the known world to find Stoke -- and set into motion events that will change everything.<br /><br />One of the worst tendencies in these books is to preach. Lots of preaching. In this case, McKiernan bangs the reader over the head with pages and pages of Aravan whining about how the dumb shortsighted humans are always polluting the air and sea, (note to McKiernan: Sewage in the ocean would NOT be a huge pollution problem!) as well as a snotty commentary on certain Christian religious beliefs (in Aravan's obnoxious little anecdote, McKiernan shows a frightening lack of logical thought). During the \\"oath\\" ceremony (where Gwylly and Faeril sort of get married), we also get a very long and boring \\"relationship\\" lecture that sounds straight out of a marital counselling session with lots of talk about \\"common ground\\" and interests and so on. And enough with the love-at-first-sight! I believe that there is such a thing, but in many of McKiernan's books, he uses it instead of slowly developing a relationship between the characters, as he does here with Gwylly and Faeril. (And I am not particularly interested in hearing about who Aravan and Riatha sleep with)<br /><br />As before, McKiernan bogs down his book with loads of travelling details and pointless pondering. He tells us way more than we want to know in some instances, such as the really gross details in fight scenes. (Enough with the intestines! I don't want to hear about people being eviscerated) And, once more, there is a lot of repetitive stuff -- if I had to hear once more about how an Elf's immortal life is \\"always just beginning,\\" I would have torn the book in half.<br /><br />And as before, his world is entirely unoriginal. Mithgar (whose root word is the same as \\"Middle-Earth\\") is a pale clone of J.R.R. Tolkien's works -- the Warrows are basically hobbits, the Elves have most (but not all of -- like ethereality) the characteristics of Tolkien's elves, Urus is quite similar to Beorn the Bear-Man, and dozens of other little things. Heck, there's even a story which is obviously lifted from LOTR's \\"Dead Marshes.\\" And McKiernan even manages to copy himself -- the Warrows-living-in-Arden-Vale is similar to that in the Hel's Crucible duology, and Gwylly has never been around other Warrows, like the protagonist of that duology.<br /><br />Another problem is that this is so closely linked with \\"Tales of Mithgar\\" that a lot of readers may have trouble reading it by itself. And the characters aren't quite as they were before. Aravan is still very dull; Riatha has lost the toughness that made her interesting before, and now she cries and moons endlessly over Urus, who has likewise become very soppy and lovestruck. Gwylly and Faeril are interesting separately, but together they are so sugary-sweet that they turned my stomach. (Especially since there is no rational reason for them to be in love -- they become sweeties after knowing each other for about a day, sleep together, and then get married --they barely even know each other). No wonder Aravan was getting moody -- between Urus/Riatha and Gwylly/Faeril, the constant gooey romance in here is incredibly annoying.<br /><br />I only recommend this book if you're on one of those incredibly long plane flights, and have nothing else to read. Irritating, poorly plotted, and with characters to set your teeth on edge, this is not a keeper.Aravan was getting moody -- between Urus/Riatha and Gwylly/Faeril, the constant gooey romance in here is incredibly annoying.

The heroine of Alice Sebold's haunting, sweet novel \\"The Lovely Bones\\" isn't out for revenge, but her ties to the living family and friends make debut an amazing, uplifting story.<br /><br />Susie Salmon is dead. On a day like any other, she was raped and brutally murdered by a seemingly harmless neighbor, who hacked up her body and buried it. Now she exists in a surprisingly simple and pleasant heaven, watching her family and friends after she vanished, and watching their lives unfold even after hers has ended.<br /><br />Her parents cling to hope that even though a lot of blood and part of an arm has been found, that Susie is still alive. But eventually, they must give up hope. Susie watches the police investigate her death, while her father pokes around to find out whodunnit. And just as importantly her family and friends stumble through the various stages of grief, trying to deal with a horrible, senseless crime that has touched each of them.<br /><br />When someone is kidnapped and/or murdered, the news usually focuses on the criminals and the gory details. Not much attention is given to the victims and the lives they once led, or how their loves ones are dealing with the tragedy. Other books would be self-conscious or miserable dealing with that kind of story, but \\"Lovely Bones\\" is something very different.<br /><br />Instead, this book possesses a quiet, comforting tone and a poetic style. Sebold's writing has an innocent charm; one enchanting scene has Susie trying to make a flower bloom for her father, and filling a celestial room with flower petals instead. The only really gritty scene is the rape-and-murder, which is all the more shocking when you realize that things like this happen in real life.<br /><br />Susie herself is a truly unique character, a narrator completely removed from the events she describes, and yet so wrapped up in the people she loves, and has left behind. And Sebold explores the many characters as they go through the grieving process, with different thoughts and actions as they try to deal with it.

And even if they do go, some kis may be a little confused by the complex storyline. And, of course, adults who need to see the pictures.<br />It's basically a picture book, the events of the Two Towers and what happens to Sam and Frodo, who were last seen heading into Mordor; Merry and Pippin, who are kidnapped by orcs and receive some unexpected help; and Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli, who are pursuing Merry and Pippin, but are waylaid by an old friend whom they thought was lost. Be forewarned, this book is crawling over with spoilers about what happens in the movie.<br />The pictures in this guide are outstanding; most of them aren't featured in the other \\"Two Towers\\" guides coming out at this time. And many are captioned with various lines from the movie (such as a photo with Frodo and Sam, which is captioned with \\"What is it, Mr. Frodo?\\" \\"Nothing. Just a dream.\\") There are good photographs of old favorites such as Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, and Pippin. There are also good shots of Gandalf in his new incarnation, the majestic ent Treebeard (a fantastic shot of a priceless character), the noble Theoden, the grotesque Gollum, and many others. The only problem I can think of is that a few of the shots never appeared in the movie, such as one pic of Frodo holding his cupped hand in front of his shirt, and Faramir watching him. And as with the \\"Fellowship\\" photo guide, some of the pictures are rather small.<br />Despite these minor problems, this is a good book for the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie fans, especially the younger ones who might need a few pointers, or the older ones who love photographs. This one has very little in common with the other \\"Two Towers\\" movie-related books, and it's worth a look.	2003-03-02

But after years of research, Stoker managed to craft the ultimate vampire novel, which has spawned countless movies, spinoffs, and books that follow the blueprint of the Transylvanian count.<br /><br />Real estate agent Jonathan Harker arrives in Transylvania, to arrange a London house sale to Count Dracula. But as the days go by, Harker witnesses increasingly horrific events, leading him to believe that Dracula is not actually human. His fiancee Mina arrives in Transylvania, and finds that he has been feverish. Meanwhile the count has vanished.<br /><br />And soon afterwards, strange things happen: a ship piloted by a dead man crashes on the shore, after a mysterious thing killed the crew. A lunatic talks about \\"Him\\" coming. And Mina's pal Lucy dies of mysterious blood loss, only to come back as an undead seductress. Dracula has arrived in England -- and he's not going to be stopped easily.<br /><br />\\"Dracula\\" is the grandaddy is Lestat and Jean-Claude, but that isn't the sole reason why it is a classic. It's also incredibly atmospheric, and very well-written. Not only is it very freaky, in an ornate Victorian style, but it is also full of restrained, quiet horror and creepy eroticism. What's more, it's shaped the portrayal of vampires in movies and books, even to this day.<br /><br />Despite already knowing what's going on for the first half of the book, it's actually kind of creepy to see these people whose lives are being disrupted by Dracula, but don't know about vampires. It's a bit tempting to yell \\"It's a vampire, you idiots!\\" every now and then, but you can't really blame them. Then the second half kicks in, with accented professor Van Helsing taking our heroes on a quest to save Mina from Dracula.<br /><br />And along the way, while our heroes try to figure stuff out, Stoker spins up all these creepy hints of Dracula's arrival. Though he wrote in the late 19th-century manner, very verbose and a bit stuffy, his skill shines through. The book is crammed with intense, evocative language, with moments like Dracula creeping down a wall, or the dead captain found tied to the wheel. Once read, they stick in your mind throughout the book.<br /><br />It's also a credit to Stoker that he keeps his characters from seeming like idiots or freaks, which they could have easily seemed like. Instead, he puts little moments of humanity in them, like Van Helsing admitting that his wife is in an asylum. Even the letters and diaries are written in different styles; for example, Seward's is restrained and analytical, while Mina's is exuberant and bright.<br /><br />Intelligent, frightening and very well-written, \\"Dracula\\" is  the well-deserved godfather of all modern vampire books and movies -- and arguably the best.very verbose and a bit stuffy, his skill shines through.

With its likeable heroine and delightful plot, this is one that bibliophiles will drool over. It's sort of as if Terry Pratchett wrote mysteries.<br />It takes place an alternate world where the Crimean War has lasted over a century, vampirism and lycanthropy are like diseases, time can be warped, and people can fall in and out of books and plays -- and if it's the original work, it will change all the other copies. Thursday Next is an agent for a special division devoted to literature, and is on the trail of the villainous Acheron Hades after the theft of the manuscript of \\"Martin Chuzzlewit\\" by Charles Dickens. (There are a lot of fantastic names in this book) To complicate matters more, her old boyfriend Landen has reentered the picture, and the obnoxious Schitt of the powerful Goliath Corporation is following Thursday.<br />Hades seems to have been killed, but Thursday is almost sure that he isn't. It turns out she's right -- he kidnaps her aunt and \\"mad as pants\\" uncle Mycroft Next, who has just made a machine that allows people to wander into pieces of literature. Hades's plot is to use the machine to disrupt literature as we know it. First he kills a minor character from \\"Martin Chuzzlewit,\\" and then kidnaps Jane Eyre (in this parallel universe, the novel has a very different ending). Thursday Next teams up with the brooding Rochester and an odd bunch of characters to save Jane -- and all the other great works of literature.<br />This is one of the best-conceived and best-executed ideas in recent years. A lot of readers probably won't understand all of the literary jokes and in-jokes (it sounds snobby, I know, but if you don't get something then just skip it), as well as some that anybody can understand (like the invention of the banana). The idea of high art as pop culture is delightfully done, like the guy with the \\"Hand of God\\" tattoo, or the door-to-door Baconian missionaries, or geeky John Milton convention. Take a sprinkling of real-life popular stuff, make it art-inclined, and that's what you get.<br />One of the best things about this book is that it overflows with promise for sequels in this universe. Time travel, a chilling scene with a lisping vampire, lycanthropy, and the wealth of literature are all dealt with, but not so thoroughly that it can't be used again. The writing style is spare and fast-moving, sort of like Terry Pratchett's but more detailed. The dialogue is very good, with a lot of good quotables.<br />Thursday Next is a likable female lead, very hard-boiled, tough and smart, but with a vulnerable side.

The prose is a bit plain and not very descriptive, but the plot and the sparkling characters are, as always, absolutely stunning. It's a weird little mystery involving wizards, writers, and spaceships.<br />Howard Sykes comes home one day to discover that an enormous Goon (small brain, big feet, limited vocabulary) is sitting in his kitchen, claiming that unless his dad Quentin produces two thousand words to \\"Archer,\\" they will be in serious trouble. Turns out that Quentin promised a mysterious man two thousand words every three months, in exchange for no more writers' block. And the problem is, when the Goon shows up again and announces that the words didn't get through. Quentin swears he won't write another word, and the Goon remains in their house (he's not supposed to leave without the words).<br />Things immediately go haywire: Howard and his sister Awful soon discover that Archer is one of seven very pushy, devious wizards that \\"farm\\" the town they live in -- there's criminal Shine, tantrum-throwing Torquil, sewer-ruling Erskine, and a bunch of others. If Archer gets the two thousand words, he'll rule the world (or \\"farm\\" it, as they say it), but if he doesn't then any of his siblings could. What do they need the words for? And how can a pair of kids defeat a bunch of very determined wizards -- especially when some people aren't quite who they seem?<br />Diana Wynne-Jones is one of the best fantasy authors out there (well, she bumped into Lewis and Tolkien -- that has to be a sign!), and while \\"Archer's Goon\\" is not her best, it's pretty high on the list. It's funny, cute, and seems very simple at first, but rapidly becomes very, very complex. The biggest problem is that in this book -- especially in the opening chapters, the writing is very stark and undescriptive, although it becomes much more descriptive later in the book. But the dialogue is still that great humorous Brit style, especially whenever someone talks to the Goon.<br />Howard is a nice (slightly bland) hero, very like a real adolescent boy in that he botches things and isn't sure what to do when his parents fight. Awful seems that way at first, but behind the insane shrieking she has a brain. The Goon is the biggest triumph of this book -- he initially seems like a simple lunkhead troll-type, but he's really a nice guy. The wizards are almost as good -- some are faking, and some are honest, and heaven help you if you try to figure it out.<br />Fans of good fantasy (adults and kids alike) will enjoy \\"Archer's Goon,\\" especially as the simple plot rapidly starts spinning off into greater complexity. Very cute, funny, and occasionally chilling.henever someone talks to the Goon.<br />Howard is a nice (slightly bland) hero, very like a real adolescent boy in that he botches things and isn't sure what to do when his parents fight.

Tolkien?\\" With the release of the astounding movie trilogy, a lot of people are suddenly flocking into the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" fandom, people who previously would have paid no attention to a classic fantasy or its author. If you don't know much about Tolkien, then this book is a good introduction to his life.<br />After an introduction where Coren talks about the popularity of the book (and how much critics hate that it IS popular), Coren introduces us to Tolkien in his youth. John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born in a turmoil-filled time, was orphaned as a boy, fought in World War I, and married and had four children. And, of course, he produced books -- the fantasy classic \\"The Hobbit\\" and the darker, more epic \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" \\"Roverandum,\\" a few other little tales, and the Bible-like \\"Silmarillion.\\"<br />Coren does a good job with the book. Not a great job, but a good job. His tone is usually pretty conversational, but occasionally he gets a little too heated or gushy or cutesy. This book doesn't contain any new interpretations or information; it's pretty basic, he tells us what Tolkien did, where, and sometimes why. There are plenty of crisp black and white photographs of Tolkien, his buddy C.S. \\"Jack\\" Lewis, Tolkien's homes, his guardian Father Morgan, book covers, parts of Oxford such as Merton College, and even a few wide shots of all of Oxford.<br />Normally this book would earn four stars, but there are some basic errors in describing people and events in \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" This is pardonable in the author -- everyone makes booboos -- but an editor should have caught those little items; that's what editors are for. It gives the book a rather rushed feel.<br />If you already know about J.R.R. Tolkien, his life and his works, then you won't get anything new from this book. But if you're a new fan, or never learned much about Tolkien himself, then this can be considered a good introduction to the basics.	2003-02-28

Considering that it now spans a grand total of eleven books, with more evidently to come, there's quite a lot of history that is all tied up in it. together. This book can serve as a good reference point.<br />The various chapters handle numbers of people or important places: Druids such as Allanon, Walker Boh, and Bremen; the Eastland, and its Dwarf and Gnome inhabitants; the Skull Kingdom; the two families, Ohmsfords and Leahs; the terrifying evil forces like the Reaper and Warlock Lord, and pretty much anything else in Shannara.<br />The main problem with \\"World of Shannara\\" is that it provides nothing new -- no hints of future events, no analyzation of the stories or characters, no breaking-down of the influences that helped spawn it (most notably \\"Lord of the Rings\\"). So while it's a good reference work, it's not really much more than that.<br />The illustrations are a mixed bag. Some illustrations, like the Sword on display in Paranor, or the Hadeshorn, are very beautiful, detailed and haunting. There are also acceptable ones, usually more simply drawn against a pseudo-parchment background. And unfortunately some of them are lifeless generic fantasy art, like the illustration of Brin Ohmsford, who looks like a teenage girl at the Renaissance Faire. However, the biggest bonus is probably the maps of various parts of Shannara, and definitely the cross-sections of some of the buildings.<br />Overall this won't tell you much (aside from cross-sections and maps) that you wouldn't find in the Shannara series itself. But you might want to keep it handy in case you occasionally need to be reminded who did what where, when, and why.	2003-02-27

Harris serve up a worthy successor to \\"Queen's Own Fool\\": \\"Girl in a Cage,\\" the second of four historical novels taking place during pivotal parts of Scottish history. \\"Girl\\" is a great read, funny and chilling and taking readers right into the middle of Scotland during the time of Robert the Bruce.<br />As the book opens, Marjorie Bruce is being dragged by English soldiers to a small town, where she is tossed into an animal's cage. The villagers treat her with disgust, and she is kept under guard. Her life was turned upside-down when her father confronted and killed Red Comyn, a treacherous lackey of King Edward Longshanks. Now Marjorie's father, Robert the Bruce, has been crowned king of Scotland, and Longshanks is trying to hunt down and kill him.<br />In flashback, Marjorie reveals the events that turned herself, her stepmother, and her relations into fugitives. In the present, the dying Longshanks visits Marjorie's cage to taunt her, pressing the lonely girl to betray her father in exchange for release. And Marjorie, crown princess of Scotland, is determined to outlast the enemy king, no matter what.<br />Usually flashbacks stink. But Harris and Yolen pull it off wonderfully, flipping between the past and the present. And even though in the present Marjorie never budges from her cage, there are all sorts of little subplots, such as some peasant children who become her \\"knights\\" and \\"ladies-in-waiting,\\" or the kindly monk who tries to help her in small ways.<br />Marjorie's character development is absolutely wonderful; at the beginning of the whole adventure, she's a bit immature and petulant. But her rude awakening when she is treated like less than an animal is well-drawn, and her iron-clad determination to outlast Longshanks. Speaking of Longshanks, he is presented as a pretty vile person, but not two-dimensionally so -- one very striking scene near the end has him talking about his dead wife.<br />The writing isn't too wrapped up in historical details the way most historical novels are. And as with \\"Fool,\\" Yolen and Harris are careful with the very complex politics of the times. They make all this easy to understand, but never dumbed-down. The descriptions of Marjorie's misery in the cage is haunting.. And the last chapters are incredibly powerful, with Marjorie's last talk with Longshanks and a very unexpected twist. (Whatever it is, you won't expect it)<br />Adults and kids alike can read \\"Girl in a Cage\\" -- like \\"Fool,\\" it's one of those fantastic historical books that will be as good for any age group, especially for people who love Scotland.n historical details the way most historical novels are.

Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator	Books	5	29	30	N	N	A must for fans of Middle-Earth	With the reissue of Tolkien's cover of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and other original drawings that he did, it seems like an appropriate time to pick up this book. Why? Because for a really complete vision of Tolkien's work (Lord of the Rings, Hobbit, and all the rest) it's probably best to see it as he saw it.<br />This book contains all the artwork that Tolkien created (NOT all the artwork BASED on his works, just the stuff he did himself!). Some are miscellaneous sketches and doodles, some are watercolors, ink drawings, prints, pencil sketches, and combinations of all of the above. One doodle looks like multicolored snowflakes, some are landscapes or pictures of little houses, teddy bears, owls, and so on. Very cute and cool, especially the illustrations done for &quot;Roverandum.&quot;<br />And many are Middle-Earth related -- different views of the Misty Mountains or the Elvenking's hall, the evolution of what the Shire looked like, different Laketowns, different &quot;Doors of Durin,&quot; even drawings of the tattered pages of the Dwarf Book of Moria. Near the end, even Tolkien's design drawings for LOTR book covers are included. And, of course -- MAPS! Maps of Wilderland, as well as the famous map from &quot;Hobbit.&quot;<br />The text accompanying these many pictures carefully dissects all of the drawings and their importance, as well as how they evolved. (It's a bit like looking at concept art) As well as going over only Tolkien's work, Wayne G. Hammond also examines influences on Tolkien's artwork. For example, there is a fairy-tale picture that influenced a &quot;Hobbit&quot; picture, and a scientific drawing of a golden eagle that influenced another &quot;Hobbit&quot; picture with Bilbo.<br />This is a must-read for fans of J.R.R. Tolkien, a great peek into a great mind. And it emphasizes that Tolkien was not just a brilliant writer, but a brilliant artist as well. Great stuff, definitely a must-see.	2003-02-27

Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia, \\"The Horse And His Boy\\" is probably my favorite. Venturing into exotic locations, with a likeable cast and a good thriller format, this is a pretty cool fantasy that gives some insights into what the cast of \\"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" were doing during that time before they returned home.<br />Shasta is the son of a poor fisherman, and his life is pretty ordinary until a mighty Calormene (sort of a generic Mideastern civilization) Tarkaan comes to stay at his home. He overhears his father admit that he found the infant Shasta on a raft with a dead man, and the Tarkaan offers to buy him. That night, Shasta escapes with the Tarkaan's talking Narnian horse Bree, and by chance bumps into a runaway Calormene girl called Aravis, who also has a Narnia horse (Hwin).<br />The four plan to run away to the free land of Narnia. But they run into problems when they enter the city of Tashbaan -- the rotten son of the Tisroc (emperor) is planning to kidnap Queen Susan of Narnia and marry her whether she likes it or not. What's more, Shasta is caught up by the kings of Narnia, who think he's the prince of Archenland -- what's more, the prince looks exactly like Shasta. With the guidance of the mysterious Aslan, Shasta and Aravis must keep the Calormenes from attacking Narnia.<br />The later books in Lewis's series are probably a bit better than the first ones, literaturewise. This book introduces new and very interesting characters, as well as bringing back old ones like the kings and queens of Narnia, Tumnus, and Aslan, of course. The Christian subtext is probably faintest in this volume, and it's probably the least connected to the main storyline that runs through the series. But it's also a good exploration of stuff that Lewis had introduced, such as the Middle-Eastern Calormen kingdom, and the talking animals. And the writing is superb, especially the scene with Shasta near the tombs.<br />Aravis may be my favorite character in the Chronicles -- she's tough, decisive, independant, and smart. She's a bit reminiscent of J.R.R. Tolkien's Eowyn, or one of Lloyd Alexander's more serious heroines. Shasta is a nice twist on the boy-with-mysterious past, a likeable kid who is a bit in over his head but keeps working at it. Bree and Hwin are also likeable, with different personalities (Bree is more sarcastic, Hwin is meeker) and after awhile you may forget that they're horses.<br />Even taken outside the Chronicles (one of the early fantasy series, and one that helped spawn many of the staples of fantasy literature), this is an entertaining story for anybody who enjoys a good story.e Chronicles -- she's tough, decisive, independant, and smart.

Now I'm glad she did. \\"Life After God\\" has a somewhat experimental feel to the narrative, but it's a successful experiment if it is.<br />Coupland explores the concept: \\"You are the first generation raised without religion.\\" Or more specifically, how human beings (all of which are born with a drive to believe in something -- religion, politics, art) respond to the material-driven world. Meditations on what separates humans from animals, imagining a nuclear explosion and how it would immediately impact the people who die in it, a philosophical bout with depression, and how people respond to their \\"lives after God.\\"<br />Disregard the initially off-putting title of the book, because that title really doesn't reflect what the book is about. At the end of one short story, the narrator concludes, \\"My secret is that I need God.\\" Not the way religious fanatic Dana does, which is more needy and superficial, but rather in a deep and primal way. And Coupland doesn't go overboard trying to explain it to the readers -- he just writes it and lets it sink in.<br />It has a slightly odd format; the pages are tiny, and the parts of each short story are more like connected vignettes, some only a few sentences long. And it's sprinkled with cute little drawings, like Coupland doodled on his manuscript. (Rain, boxes, computers, matches, and a parakeet with a key in its beak, among others) As in Coupland's other books, there is a sort of unhappy optimism to these stories, and Coupland's musings about how a lack of emphasized God has affected our ability to love and believe.<br />\\"Life After God\\" is not exactly an ordinary book. But it touches very well on hard-to-write-about topics and its messages lingered for a long time in my mind.	2003-02-26

But she's also penned a series of short novellas, the Princess Tales. Now three of these cute stories are available in a three-for-one paperback, that fans of retold fairy tales will enjoy.<br />\\"The Princess Test\\" is tried on Lorelei when she stumbles onto a castle. There, all the girls who try out are tested as to whether they are \\"real\\" princesses, and the girl who is deemed most worthy will marry Prince Nicholas. But Nicholas wants a girl he loves!<br />\\"The Fairy's Mistake\\" is a definite problem. Two girls encounter the fairy Ethelinda, and she gives them what they deserve: Sweet Rosella has jewels and flowers fall from her mouth, while nasty Myrtle has snakes and toads. The mistake? Now Rosella is held captive by a greedy prince, and Myrtle is using her \\"gift\\" as blackmail.<br />\\"Princess Sonora and the Long Sleep\\" is a twist on a familiar tale -- spinning wheel, enchanted sleep, fairy gifts and curses. But there are a few elements that weren't there before -- balding sheep, a prince who doesn't work out, and fairies who are getting a little competitive.<br />These stories don't have the length to develop the depth of \\"Princesses of Bamarre\\" or \\"Ella Enchanted,\\" but they're nice twists on the old fairy-tales. Her heroines are endearingly smart and independant, the love interests are likeable, and the twists on the stories are cute. (Such as the \\"Fairy's Mistake,\\" where the blessing turns out to be more trouble than the curse)<br />If you like retold fables or smart heroines, then the three-pack \\"Princess Tales\\" are a good light read, especially for those who like a humorous ending.	2003-02-26

It's a nice peephole into the 1970s and 1980s rock scenes, and glimpses of the human sides of the larger-than-life people of that era. Not to mention that Bebe's own recollections are colorful and endearing.<br />Bebe starts off with her teenage years growing up on a military base, where it became evident quickly that she was not going to be the typical traditional girlie. She went to New York to become a model, and there met rocker Todd Rundgren, with whom she fell in love and moved in with. Now immersed in the rock'n'roll scene, Bebe became friends with people like Debbie Harry, David Bowie, Paul and Linda McCartney, John Lennon, Ron Wood, Rick and Liz Derringer, Keith Richardson, and Anita Pallenberg. She also became involved with rockers like Iggy Pop, Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones, Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, and perhaps most famously with Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, with whom she had a daughter, Liv.<br />Bebe covers her acrimonious breakup with Todd Rundgren and her struggle as a single mother (who had a modeling stigma by that time, because she had posed for Playboy). She embarked in a heartbreaking romance with Elvis Costello and led two bands (The B-Sides and the Gargoyles). And then the truth about Liv's paternity came into the open, then Liv became a famous model and actress. And then Bebe crashed into a terrible depression, only to rise up stronger and happier than before.<br />I really don't know what the wild'n'crazy rock scene of the 70s was like, because I wasn't alive in the seventies. But Bebe gives a pretty good idea of what it was like to be where Mick Jagger could wander up to the front door and announce \\"I have yogurt!\\" She focuses less on the much-publicized stuff that went on, than her personal experiences; one example is the month she spent with the Rolling Stones and Ron Wood at a house in the country, which is one of the funniest parts of the book. (\\"I've come for a cuddle\\") And she gives some humanity to rock figures like Keith Richards, Steven Tyler and Mick Jagger, who are often portrayed just as rock animals and not as human beings.<br />One interesting thing is what a likeable person Bebe Buell is. A lot of rock biographies from that era are bitter and full of old grudges, but Bebe has something positive to say about almost everyone. She doesn't skimp on the flaws and addictions of those around her, but she counterbalances with positive stuff. She comes across as an immensely nice, generous, sweet person; it's pretty easy to see why these guys liked having her around, and why she seems to have made friends all around. Moreover, she's willing to admit when she did things she shouldn't have, when she messed up, and to admit some humiliating things as well.<br />The photographs mostly focus on Bebe, both modelling and personal photos. There are also pictures of her boyfriends, pals, and daughter Liv (as a baby, no less!) The tone of the book is pleasantly conversational, as if you were chitchatting. That's one of the flaws of it; occasionally anecdotes include some repetitive stuff or awkward phrasing. This isn't a book for kids (are ANY good rock bios for kids?), because it includes some nude pictures and details of Bebe's romantic liaisons. Nothing too graphic, but she's pretty clear on what went on.<br />Though initially I wasn't too crazy about this book, I think I can honestly now call myself a fan of Bebe Buell as well as her daughter Liv. It's a great glimpse into the classic rock scene, as well as an enjoyable (and never-boring) biography by a very nice lady. Definitely worth the read.parts of the book.

When you think of Shakespeare, you automatically think of plays -- \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" \\"Macbeth,\\" \\"Hamlet,\\" etc.<br /><br />But he was also a poet of considerable skill. And while he sprinkled his various plays with poetry and songs, his poems are best appreciated when they're read all by themselves -- particularly the cluster of brilliant \\"Sonnets\\" that he penned. These works just have a unique, hauntingly vivid flavour of their own.<br /><br />Each sonnet has no title, and is simply identified by numbers. And while Shakespeare's love poems are the best known of these works, he addresses different themes in theme -- old age, writer's block loneliness, the cruelty of the world, sex, beauty, a mysterious rival poet, and Shakespeare's own complicated romantic feelings (love that \\"looks upon tempests and is not shaken\\").<br /><br />And these poems are absolutely lovely. Some of these sonnets are pretty well-known (\\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?/Thou art more lovely and more temperate\\") but most of them are a little more obscure. They have vivid metaphors and imagery (\\"let not winter's ragged hand deface,\\" \\"gold candles fix'd in heaven's air\\") and hauntingly lovely passages (\\"What is your substance, whereof are you made,/That millions of strange shadows on you tend?\\").<br /><br />And these sonnets really give you new insights into Shakespeare as a person -- he feels uncertainty, passionate love, unhappiness, lust and quirky humor. But while it's obvious these sonnets were deeply personal, they can still be appreciated on their own, particularly as love poetry.<br /><br />William Shakespeare's \\"Sonnets\\" are rich with meaning, language and atmosphere -- the Elizabethan English takes a little deciphering, but it's well worth it.	2003-02-23

In fact, it's a bit misleading to classify it just as children's lit, because this book has more brains than most adult space operas.<br />The planet of Xilan was colonized by humans centuries ago, but their descendents remember nothing of Earth, and have no technology except an inactive ship that they don't recognize. They live in a primitive village, where lives are short and mortality rates are high, and their bodies have changed to adapt to the planet. But despite the hostility of the place, they've survived.<br />Then a new wave of colonists come to Xilan -- people from Earth who didn't know the Xilans were there. The Xilans are suddenly exposed to amazing technology and the promise of a future elsewhere, but they want to stay where they are -- even though the alien planet may ultimately wipe them out.<br />I confess that I liked this book less than \\"Orvis,\\" because Orvis was simply a story, whereas this has the slightly meandering feeling of \\"a week in the life of a space colonist.\\" There's a definite beginning and end, but it all goes at a pretty even pace with no highs or lows. Despite this, it's a good story and raises some intelligent questions: Should people be helped even if they don't want it? Should they be helped if they don't have the full picture? Who was right or wrong in this conflict, or was no one really in the wrong?<br />Hoover does a good job with the characters, though at times the colonists seem a bit too bullheaded and the primitives a little too stubborn. (Oh come on -- at least a few curious people would want to leave!) But the two lead characters are counterparts from two different civilizations, and so we get some focus on them. Lee and Gareth are actually very similar, stubborn and with the perspective of her group, yet able to see some of the viewpoint of the other side.<br />Hoover's writing is pretty spare and solid, not too many details. But the vision of the future seems pretty plausible, and Hoover doesn't get too caught up in trying to make it TOO futuristic. There isn't any violence, though there are some alarming images of sickness and insanity, not much profanity and no smut.<br />\\"Another Heaven, Another Earth\\" is a pretty good SF read in a genre (real SF for juveniles) that is one of the smallest out there. Good for kids and adults alike, as are Hoover's other books.r />Hoover's writing is pretty spare and solid, not too many details.

But even if you don't buy gift books, this is so far and above the other ones that it should definitely be purchased.<br />This is Bilbo's song as he arrives at the Grey Havens at the finale of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" at the Elven ships that will sail for the Undying Lands. His thoughts as he prepares to leave Middle-Earth are looking back on his long, adventure-filled life -- poignant, peaceful, and a little bit hopeful for the future.<br />While this is not a story or a sequel, it is nevertheless very Tolkienish. The rhythm, meter, and wording of this little poem is very recognizable as Tolkien's work, for anyone who has read his books and the wonderful poetry that is sprinkled through them. And Pauline Baynes has augmented the poetry with a series of beautiful pictures. Quite detailed and pretty, they have a slightly unearthly tinge, like the starlight around the Elves. And this new edition has excellent paper and printing, very high quality.<br />Even those who aren't die-hard Tolkien fans can appreciate the beauty of his poetry and the perfect accompaniment of Baynes' pictures. Lovely little gem.	2003-02-21

Ambrose Bierce, a very angry and witty man, wrote down his personal definitions (1881 to 1906) of various things and concepts, which were eventually compiled into \\"The Devil's Dictionary.\\" The result is immensely funny in a twisted kind of way.<br />A bigot is \\"one who is obstinately and zealously attached to an opinion that you do not share.\\" Disobedience is \\"the silver lining on the cloud of servitude.\\" Brute is \\"see: Husband.\\" Patience is \\"a minor form of despair, disguised as a virtue.\\" Philosophy is \\"a route of many roads leading from nowhere to nothing.\\" And that's just a few...<br />Weirdly funny, twistingly witty.

Not that there are demons, monsers, or flying body bits, but in that it lays bare some truly horrifying facets of human nature, and what they can cause people to do. It's haunting and not for the timid. Or the weak of stomach.<br />Colin and Mary are lovers on vacation in Italy, increasingly bored and uninterested in one another. They amble around hotels and tourist streets without any genuine interest. Then they accidently bump into Robert, a seemingly friendly man with an unhappy family history and an initially harmless attachment to the couple.<br />From there, Colin and Mary stay with Robert and his crippled wife Caroline, who seems friendly but oddly insistent that they stay for awhile. Colin and Mary rediscover their physical attraction to one another, but they also are increasingly uneasy with the forceful friendship of Robert and Carllin. And soon that friendship is revealed as terrible, erotic, and violent.<br />Ian McEwan's books remind me of those movies where the skies are cloudy, the alleys are dank, and everybody is hiding secret motives. There is a sort of dark aura from the beginning on the book onward, as if tragedy is creeping up from page one onward. Despite this gradual buildup, and the increasingly horrific life stories that Robert and Caroline tell, the climax is a horrible shock.<br />McEwan's writing swings freely between oddly dreamlike and shockingly vivid -- if anything, the vividity of his writing is more so because the weird stuff is written in such poetic prose. His dialogue is mostly good, except when the characters launch into philosophical ramblings about women and men and whether women want to be dominated. He is extremely talented in portraying the few characters -- Colin and Mary are bland but essentially harmless, while Caroline and Robert crackle with energy, but, they are extremely frightening. This book is not one for kids, it has a lot of sexual content, including some really twisted, frightening stuff. Heck, some adults may not like it.<br />It's a quick read, took me only half an hour to read it. But it's dark and haunting, and not for thw weak of heart.ing some really twisted, frightening stuff.

Cartoonist Jim Toomey presents the earliest incarnations of his immensely funny sea-dwelling goofballs, and I am loving every little page of it.<br />Sherman tries his fin at being a rapper, the Loch Ness Monster makes a cameo at a stamp machine, Sherman learns where he is on the speed dial of love, Hawthorne gets antenna extensions (yes, we see this storyline later in the strip, but it's different and still funny here), and Fillmore makes another doomed attempt at finding his soulmate.<br />There are some differences between these strips and the later ones. Hawthorne has long eyestalks and almost invisible mouth, there's more emphasis on secondary fishie characters, and some even take place (\\"Calvin & Hobbes-like\\") in a classroom with a forbidding teacher. The artwork is a bit rougher, the humor a little more scattered. But these are the same weird, dumb, gag-infested sea creatures we know and love.	2003-02-14

Her \\"Dido\\" series is easily found, but only recently books like \\"Cockatrice Boys\\" and \\"Whispering Mountain\\" have been made available. \\"Shadow Guests\\" is the latest of these -- it isn't quite as good as the others, but still quite enjoyable.<br />After his mother and older brother mysteriously vanish, Cosmo Curtoys is sent to live with an eccentric mathematician relative in England. While Aunt Eunice is pleasant (though odd), Cosmo rapidly makes enemies of almost every other kid in school. What's more, strange things have begun lurking nearby, including a tadpole-like thing that fell off of his sleeve -- and grew.<br />Soon Cosmo finds out about something linked to the disappearance of his mom and brother -- a family curse that dooms every eldest brother to die in battle, and every mother to die of grief. Because of this curse, he is visited by \\"shadow guests,\\" a Roman gladiatior, a naive Crusader... and a sinister force that threatens to kill him.<br />It's definitely above the average ghost story, and makes good use of Cosmo's social isolation to let him encounter ancestors who are also burdened by the curse. Cosmo is a likeable hero, who alternates between not understanding what's happening, and knowing all too well what is going on. Cousin Eunice is a nice (mathematician) twist on the usual weird relative; the kids at school often seem like their friendliness or hostility has some bearing on the story, but ultimately that peters out.<br />Aiken's writing is pleasant, although the pacing is a bit odd -- one minute we're reading about kids snubbing him at school or playing jokes on Bun, then we're reading about ghosts and ancient warlocks and family curses. Moreover, some of the details in the book must have passed me by, because I didn't quite understand a few parts of the ending. But the haunting (pun intended) atmosphere and mix of the unearthly and the solidly, likeably British is very fresh-feeling.<br />While this book isn't quite as stellar as \\"Cockatrice\\" or \\"Mountain,\\" it's a solid ghost story with a pleasant storyline and hero.

Unfortunately this book is mostly about just that: Charles and Diana. Better to have cut out most of the stuff on them and focused on the \\"Boys.\\"<br />It begins as the news of Diana's death reaches the Windsor family, and the reactions of the people there. Then it shoots back in time to show the lives and backgrounds of Charles and Diana, the seemingly golden royal couple whose marriage deteriorated under adultery, lies, and the piercing eye of the press. William and Harry grew up in this bizarre enviroment, and the book includes some of what they have been doing since their mother's sudden death.<br /><br />This might have been a good -- albeit slim -- book, if Anderson had kept his eyes focused on Diana's boys. But at least two-thirds is barely about the boys, but a rehash of all the stuff about Diana. We've seen it all before, and Anderson's presentation is not particularly interesting. Perhaps it's because Charles and Harry, royal hijinks included, just haven't done that much of note yet.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems with the book is that the author tries to cover all the bases. In the matter of these two, it's really not possible to not take sides. So, Charles let his wife suffer, stayed with Camilla, and he went off to the opera when his son was beaned by a golf club. \\"Charles is scum,\\" you will be saying -- Anderson is presenting him in that light. But after that, we are presented with a more ooey-gooey, sensitive, forgiving picture of Charles as an ex and a father. It's like Anderson wrote a postscript to his Diana love note, devoted to Charles. It doesn't work! Either you think Diana was right, or you think Charles was. You cannot say that they were both okay, kindly and fine -- if they had been, then presumably they would not have broken up.<br /><br />The parts about Harry and William are actually the most interesting parts of the book; there are some cute photographs and anecdotes, like William playing with a tot, working as a rap deejay (cute \\"rock on\\" gesture here), and Harry giggling at his brother's inability to get his driver's license without press attention. But like many biographers, Anderson also descends to tabloid sniggering. We're presented with entire photographic pages of William's ex-girlfriends, including First Niece Lauren Bush. there's a weird anecdote about William creeping into girls' camping tents, which is never credited to anyone or even a publication.<br /><br />This book has some endearing stuff about the \\"Boys,\\" marred by a spattering of tabloid material (am I the only one who doesn't care who William is dating?). But most of it is the thousandth rehash of Charles and Di's messy marriage -- better to wait until their sons get a real biography written about them.lliam are actually the most interesting parts of the book; there are some cute photographs and anecdotes, like William playing with a tot, working as a rap deejay (cute \\"rock on\\" gesture here), and Harry giggling at his brother's inability to get his driver's license without press attention.

John Paul is a precocious Polish Catholic child (five and a half) whose parents haven't noticed his unusual intelligence. But a government tester does, and soon a tug-of-war begins between his parents and the people who want to reshape him into a battle strategist.<br />&quot;Investment Counselor&quot; is a &quot;plug the hole&quot; type of story. It's been years since the events of &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; and Ender is travelling the stars. He also has turned twenty, and there's a slight problem concerning the whole tax thing. The one to help him? An artificial intelligence named Jane -- a familiar figure to fans of the Ender series.<br />And the third story is the original &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; a short story published in the late 70s, that produced the idea of the Battle school, genius children Ender and Bean, and a sort of microcosm of the eventual epic series that Card has since written.<br />It's a smal book, only about 150 pages, but Card never tries to flesh it out too much. It's the content of the stories that really makes it worth the buy, because of what he does with them. &quot;Boy&quot; adds an extra dimension to Ender's father and the situations that came years later. &quot;Investment&quot; is a nice bit of backstory, with a slightly humorous tone that makes it lighter than the books. And &quot;Ender's Game&quot; (the short story) is merely pleasant to read because it's nice to see how this short story blossomed and expanded.<br />Fans of Card will not be disappointed by this well-written, interesting collection of stories. This is the kind of SF I like to read.	2003-02-10

He was a prolific writer and an influence on grand masters C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, and here some of his less-known (but well-written) works.<br />First of all is his essay on &quot;The Fantastic Imagination,&quot; where he discusses fantasy, fairy tales, and the nature of childlike innocence. There are also short stories, such as the novella &quot;Light Princess,&quot; about a girl who is a lightweight in mind AND body, excerpts from the dreamy fantasy novel &quot;At The Back of the North Wind,&quot; the haunting &quot;Shadows&quot; that appear for a king, a &quot;Wise Woman&quot; who sweeps away an obnoxious princess, and several others.<br />MacDonald's stories have the sort of rich, compelling prose that the best of 19th-century literature has. His stories are full of creepy creatures, magical women, golden keys and dreamy atmosphere, the sort of stuff now written by Jane Yolen and not many others. But they're also more grounded and traditionally fairy-tale-like than the stories of later writer Lord Dunsany. Rather, you can see how Lewis and Tolkien would have both enjoyed and been influenced by MacDonald.<br />A good selection of short stories and a thought-provoking essay, definitely for fans of fantasy and fairy tales. Delightful.	2003-02-10

Harry Potter? Nope, it's the teenage hero of the new dark fantasy \\"Ravenscliff Series.\\" Geoffrey Huntington weaves together gothic elements with an intriguingly murky plot about evil ghosts, disguised demons, and a budding sorcerer that teens will love.<br />Devon March is not like other boys: He hears voices, can move and affect things with his mind, and the things that go bump in his closet are for real. Ever since he was little, he has been pursued by demons which his father always assured him he was stronger than them. But when his father dies, revealing that Devon is adopted, he is sent to live with the weird Muir family in their rambling seaside mansion of Ravenscliff. There is the cold Mrs. Crandall, her energetic daughter Cecily, and mischievous nephew Alexander, not to mention the creepy caretaker Simon and charming, secretive competitor Rolfe Montaigne (great name!).<br />And Devon's problems only get worse. Demons begin to up their attacks on him and those around him, and he starts to suspect that the precocious Alexander may not be merely mischievous, or even destructive -- he may be the conduit for a vengeful presence seeking to release demons from the Hellhole. To battle the evil forces in his new home, Devon will learn his true nature as a sorcerer, and may find the keys to his past.<br />Really good dark fantasy (or fantastic horror, or whatever) is a very rare thing because the authors usually just throw one shock after another at the readers. Huntington, on the other hand, utilizes gothic cliches (the sinister mansion with a tragic past, abandoned towers with lights, the weird caretaker) with the excellent idea of the Sorcerers of the Nightwing. Despite using a combination of stuff that could have been stupid if handled badly (demons in the closet, evil clown-face), and stuff that has been done many times before (gothic cliches), nothing Huntington does seems stale or affected. If anything, the gothic atmosphere is better because Huntington takes the old cliches and remakes them, rather than shying away from them.<br />He also handles Devon March very well; almost all of the book is seen through Devon's eyes, and so we have a good idea of his fears and thoughts. If readers want someone deeper than Harry Potter, then Devon may be the right hero. Cecily seems like a less chattery Lloyd Alexander heroine, while Alexander reeks with innocent-faced creepiness. Readers may especially like Rolfe; at first it seems hard to tell what side he's on, but he's intriguing right from the start.<br />His writing style is fairly descriptive, mainly when it needs to be (no intricate descriptions of pizza parlors). But when describing the grotesque and the weird, such as a maimed ghost, he doesn't try to shock us. He also has a good sense of how to build up tension and suspense with little hints of the horrific, rather than flying blood and body bits; the plot twists and past events are well-drawn and evocative. The dialogue is also very good, especially anything uttered by the villain (\\"Can you spell it, boys and girls? W-R-O-N-G!\\").<br />Teenagers and adults will definitely enjoy the opener of this series, especially those with a love of ghoulies, ghosties, long-leggedy-beasties, and sorcerers who make books fly through the air.

It's not a typical fantasy, but it should definitely be given a look.<br />After the Great White (nuclear holocaust), the Beforetime civilization was pretty much destroyed -- the people remaining lost most of their knowledge of the past, and genetic mutations altered the minds and bodies of animals and humans alike. The human mutants are known as Misfits, and if they're found, they are burned by the Council on the assumption that they are possessed by demons. One such girl is Elspeth Gordie, a girl who has kept her psychic abilities secret for a long time. But a future-seeing cat pal of hers sees the future -- that she will be found out and taken to the ountains.<br />His prediction comes true. Elspeth, instead of being burned, is taken to the mountain prison of Obernewtyn. Misfits there are kept as laborers, and the mysterious Master of Obernewtyn is supposedly trying to find a cure for them. But Elspeth soon learns that all is not as it seems -- the Misfits are being used by someone at Obernewtyn to find out the nuclear secrets of the past.<br />Not bad -- not bad at all. Isobelle Carmody puts a lot of work into making her world believable and sort of simple -- she doesn't overburden us with too many weird developments, like many postapocalypse fantasies do. Very realistically, \\"Beforetime\\" is viewed sort of the way we view ancient Rome, as a noisy, mean, fascinatingly mysterious place; it's very cool when she has Elspeth flipping through a manual for computers that don't exist anymore. Telepathic talking animals and ever-increasing psychic abilities add an extra edge to the book, though one that is thankfully never overused.<br />Elspeth is a good heroine in the sense that she reacts very much the way you'd expect her to, since she is an orphaned girl with no real friends until she lands in Obernewtyn. That doesn't mean that she's always likeable, but she's always believable. The supporting characters tend to be a bit flatter, as the good guys tend to run together a little. The less sympathetic characters like Rushton, Jes, and the real Master are more three-dimensional, they have a little more bite to them.<br />Carmody's plotting still lacks somewhat -- her prose is pretty standard, nothing mind-blowing here. And the middle of the book sags a bit as Elspeth lives her first months at Obernewtyn. For a long time, nothing really seems to happen except people snap at her. But she does give a drearily hopeless atmosphere to Obernewtyn, and does one of the best jobs of \\"talking animals\\" ever.

It's far from flawless, but<br />Thomas Wisdom's family is nice. Too nice. His parents are models of patience, wisdom and kindness, and his sister is the idealized teen daughter (now dating a boringly perfect surfer). Somehow this all seems unnatural to Thomas, and soon he finds out why: His parents, his sister, his slightly nutty dog, and many other people across the world are humanlike alien constructions called \\"Angels,\\" controlled by an immensely powerful intelligence from a far-off planet, sent to infiltrate human society and save us from ourselves. He himself is adopted, the son of a jaded but kindly ex-barmaid, and the only family member who is really human.<br />Thomas is at first willing to accept the angels and even help them, but his friend Gip is still suspicious. They uncover evidence that one of their teachers was killed for hacking into secret files about the angels, and Thomas begins to rebel against his parents and what they want for humanity. But who can he trust -- and will he be the next to mysteriously die if the angels think it's all for the best?<br />Terence Blacker raises a lot of questions in his novel. Is it better to give up free will for security? How much free will do we have? Do we need some bad mixed in with the good to be really, genuinely human? And should you not feel bad because that irritatingly perfect neighbor with the perfect kids might really be an angel? In the manner of Lois Lowry's \\"The Giver,\\" he presents you with these questions without battering your head with them.<br />His writing style is pleasantly evocative, especially the soothing alien voice that tells Thomas what he should do. His angel characters are all quite flat, but that was probably intentional. Thomas is a lot more vivid, especially his growing paranoia and his hysterical response to learning that he was adopted. His buddy Gip is even more colorful, weird and X-filesian and harboring a secret of his own; Thomas's mother is a good foil to the perfect parents -- she's flawed and hardened, in a humiliating job, but she clearly cares about him.<br />The biggest problem is the ending. Blacker twists up a lot of sugarcoated, sinister threads and hints -- we see what the angels will do to protect their secret agenda, including murder of a few troublesome individuals. Basically, they are cold and ruthless underneath the \\"all-for-the-best\\" niceness. Yet it seems like he wasn't sure what to do in the final chapters, so wrapped it up in the most convenient way possible.

(Thanks to a disease/healing goddess who visits him in his dreams) When he accidently infects and is attacked by the people of Italbar, he becomes a walking plague machine. Malacar, the one man still living on Earth with his telepathic alien translator, wants to find Heidel with the help of a vengeance-loving girl from a brothel. But Heidal is becoming more and more dangerous with the goddess's help...<br />\\"A Dark Travelling\\" has a family that makes yours look downright normal. Jim is a teen werewolf. His sister is a witch. His brother is an assassin who lives in a castle. His father travels dimensions, or \\"bands.\\" But one night his father mysteriously vanishes, and Jim goes on a desperate, magical search for him. And it leads him to sorcerers and rebels on one of the \\"darkbands,\\" where his father has been taken captive for a shocking reason.<br />These books aren't the most prominent ones that Zelazny wrote, but they're enjoyable reads. \\"Dark Travelling\\" has a sort of frothier edge to it -- the plot almost never stops going until the end, with a small cast of characters (several of whom remain a bit underdeveloped) and no philosophical musings. \\"Italbar,\\" on the other hand, is much deeper and darker, with a lot of dream conversations and telepathic linking. A lot more action is going on inside the characters' heads.<br />On a quality front, these ibook reprints have good smooth paper and good bindings.

But then they bump into the extremely wise Agmar and his servant Slag. Agmar helps the beggars disguise themselves as gods and fool the inhabitants of the city of Kongros.<br />It's a cute, fast-moving little story with likeable characters, Woldery wine, and a moderately goofy storyline which is kept grounded with Dunsany's mythical-sounding prose.

A lot of the stuff in it is in the mold of other books like the Prydain Chronicles and \\"Arkadians,\\" but it never feels stale at all.<br />In the country of Hamelin-Loring, Sebastian is the fourth fiddler in the Baron's orchestra, and a mistake costs him his job and sends him wandering with nothing but his fiddle. He loses the fiddle to a gang of thugs, and gains a pet cat called Presto. When he tries to steal food he is rescued from death by a pleasant stranger called Nicholas, who takes Sebastian under his wing.<br />But they end up rescuing a girl dressed as a boy, who happens to be the Princess Isabel, who has run away from her castle so that she will not have to marry the Regent. To save themselves they will have to dodge the Regent's ruthless spies and soldiers, the disgruntled citizens of Hamelin-Loring, and possibly the mysterious rebel Captain -- with a ragtag circus troupe, a cursed violin, and a very smart cat as their allies.<br />\\"Marvelous Misadventures of Sebastian\\" is a charming, delightful story that shows Alexander at his best, with the exception of the Prydain Chronicles. Alexander keeps a good pace and storyline going while also including a few subtle lessons about pride, love, kindness, and a few things about music. (He himself plays the violin) He throws in a few twisting plot developments that will keep you guessing about the seemingly cursed violin, which plays for Sebastian as it did for no one else, and the mysterious Captain, whose identity is kept a secret for most of the book. His writing style is brisk and fast, with a lot of funny dialogue (especially Isabel's very verbose sentences) and charming characters (the various circus performers).<br />Sebastian is the nice-guy hero that Alexander does so well, while Isabel is a bit different from his other heroines, in that she has a major lesson to learn -- originally she's a bit snobby, naive and full of herself rather than full of common-sense. Nicholas is harder to pin down, since many of his actions really don't make sense at first; Presto is delightfully three-dimensional considering that he is a cat who never talks.<br />\\"Marvelous Misadventures of Sebastian\\" lives up to its title, and readers will definitely enjoy it.

It's a good novel, with a weirdly haunting and poignant storyline. Actually, two of them. But even with a bit of choppiness in the story, it's a very moving, interesting book.<br />In the waning days of the 1970s, seventeen-year-old Karen falls into a coma during a party with her pals and her boyfriend, Richard. After making love with Richard on a mountaintop, she had confessed to having dreams of a frightening future about her friends and home; now, she lapses into a mysterious sleep that lasts another seventeen years. Nine months afterwards, she gives birth to a daughter, Megan, who is cared for by her parents.<br />Richard, still in love with her, remains near Karen and Megan, who grows up unhappy and insecure because of her depressed father and comatose mother. Her friends graduate and drift away from the place where they grew up, only to be drawn back for different reasons. And one night, when they have all come to the hospital -- Karen wakes up. As she struggles to accustom herself to the more advanced, bleaker world and the changes around her, she reveals on a talk show that the world is ending. And her words come true when the population of the world begins to fall into a sleep of death..<br />The most hard-hitting part of the book is, oddly, not the commentary on our increasingly soulless world or the end-of-the-world twists. It's the people in it, especially Richard, whose life increasingly revolves around Karen (he rarely, if ever, says that he loves her, but it's obvious he does) and Megan, whose unhappy feelings that she is Death result in a goth getup and a druggie biker boyfriend. Other people drift in and out (including the ghost of Jared, a classmate who gets to be the bemused observer), and their lives are in stark, sometimes chilling contrast to Richard's. (Especially junkies Hamilton and Pam)<br />There are some problems. The first half of the book is basically about Karen's coma and how it affects the people around her; the second half is the surreal, semi-supernatural apocalypse. It seems a little like two novellas crammed into the same book, because there aren't enough threads to tie the two halves together -- you just suddenly slam headlong into the end-of-the-world plot. And Coupland's vision of the apocalypse seems a little localized, but he more than makes up for this at the climax of the book, which is doubt the most beautiful part of the book. Sad and happy, haunting and liberating -- pure poetry. If nothing else, the book should be read because of that.<br />Coupland's writing shifts around from one part of the book to another. Sometimes it's fairly stark and matter-of-fact, but during the more introspective, symbolic, or just dreamy scenes he really lets rip with the prose. (And don't worry, the narration from a ghost is not particularly gimmicky -- Jared really does have a part to play)<br />\\"Girlfriend in a Coma\\" is in some ways not an easy book to read.

Among his friends are the sullen, cryptic John Askew and the bright aspiring actress Allie. Soon Kit becomes enmeshed in the sinister, ritual-like game called \\"Death,\\" with a spin-the-bottle knife and a jumble of grisly tokens, and sees wizened children huddled in the mines. He dreams of a prehistoric boy who struggles to survive with his baby sister, and Askew lets him see the graves of two boys -- who were called Christopher Watson and John Askew.<br />Then Kit's grandfather, who tells him of fossils and a little blond ghost, begins to fail; his memory is beginning to go. When John Askew runs away from home, Kit is drawn to learn more about this strange boy who is so fascinated by death. His search for the past, and for John Askew, will draw him down into the dark mines -- where he will find answers about John, the ghosts, Lak the caveboy, and Death.<br />\\"Kit's Wilderness\\" is one of those books that should be read at least twice, because the hauntingly vague subplots that somehow fit together. The subplots (Silky, Grandfather, Allie's acting aspirations, the game of Death, and Lak) don't really seem to have anything to do with each other. But to Almond;'s credit, he manages to weave them all together. It's a bit confusing, and some people may need to flip back to check it out, though.<br />Kit is the kind of character that Almond does best, a boy who is sensitive and observant, and we get into his head all throughout the book. Allie and John Askew serve as the yin and yang, the light and the dark. Allie's almost unreal brightness serves as a counterpoint to Askew's darkness. That isn't to say that Allie is all good and Askew is bad; they just have different personalities. Most striking is the relationship between Kit and Askew, with Kit unconsciously trying to draw Askew (who has a messed-up family) closer to the light and away from \\"death,\\" but only by stepping into the mines and onto Askew's level can he pull his friend back home.<br />Almond's writing is surreal and stark as the mining town, and his dream sequences are like travelling back in time. His dialogue, as usual, is a bit stilted and peculiar-sounding if it's spoken out loud. But it's a beautiful book that will linger in your thoughts long after you finish it.ss.

Lewis's Narnia Chronicles is a must. A close pal of J.R.R. Tolkien's and a fellow \\"Inkling,\\" Lewis was one of the first widely-read fantasy writers, and his books are still widely read and enjoyed by children and adults alike.<br />\\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" opens as four children (Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter) are being shipped to the English countryside at the beginning of World War II. While exploring and playing in the vast house where they are staying, Lucy accidently ventures into a winter-locked world called Narnia, which is ruled over by the evil White Witch. The king Aslan is about to return -- but the Witch quickly gets a hold on Edmund.<br />\\"Prince Caspian\\" takes place long after the events of \\"Lion\\" (though in our world, only a short time has passed). Young Prince Caspian escapes his uncle's castle when his life is threatened, and he finds refuge with the hidden races of Narnia -- dwarves, talking animals, dryads, centaurs and many others.  And to help Caspian regain the throne, the two kings and two queens of Narnia are called back...<br />\\"Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\" begins when Edmund, Lucy and their obnoxious cousin Eustace are sucked through a painting into Narnia, where their pal Caspian is now king of Narnia (and an adult to boot). Caspian is heading toward the end of the world to find several knights who were banished, and vanished into the perilous islands along the sea.<br />\\"The Silver Chair\\" heads into slightly darker territory when Eustace returns to boarding school. He and outcast girl Jill Pole are drawn into Narnia, where Jill must perform a task to redeem herself for a stupid act. She must find the dying Caspian's son Rilian, who vanished many years before. The search will send the two children across Narnia with the pessimistic Puddleglum, to carnivorous Giants, creepy underground creatures, and an enemy worse than they could have imagined...<br />\\"Horse and His Boy\\" shoots back in time to the middle of \\"Lion.\\" Shasta lives with the man he thinks to be his father in a hovel by the sea, but when a Calormene warrior purchases him, he escapes with the man's talking horse, Bree. He meets the escaping noblewoman Aravis (who also has a talking horse), and the two are planning to escape to Narnia and freedom. But in the capital city, there is a conspiracy brewing against the visiting Narnian kings and queens...<br />\\"Magician's Nephew\\" clears up many of the questions about Narnia, Aslan and the White Witch. Digory and Polly end up in very serious trouble when they encounter Digory's weird, slightly nutty uncle, a magician who has created magical rings that send the user to other worlds. The two kids end up in the \\"wood between the worlds,\\" and venture into a dying land where they set loose the evil Queen Jadis -- who follows them to the newborn world of Narnia.<br />\\"The Last Battle\\" is definitely the end of the series, where Narnia decays slowly into the final battle between good and evil. Humans are destroying the trees and killing the dryads, and a false Aslan is appearing to mislead the inhabitants of Narnia. Old and new friends will band together as the true Aslan prepares to lead them to a new land.<br />If you don't like allegory (religious or otherwise), then steer clear of the Chronicles. While Lewis's beliefs are presented in a more complicated and subtle manner in his other fictional works, here the parallels to basic Christian beliefs are quite evident. But if you can get past the slightly ham-handed treatment, it's a fantastic read. Lewis reshapes typical mythical elements like dwarves, nymphs, talking animals, centaurs and wicked witches into shape in his invented world. And Narnia is an inviting place -- it isn't always fun or pleasant, but there is always the feeling that the good guys will ultimately come out on top.<br />Charmingly written and full of endearing, entertaining characters, the classic Narnia books are a must-read for any fantasy reader.ust-read for any fantasy reader.	2003-01-21

Marshall has penned in &quot;Have You Any Spare Cue Sticks?&quot; Like a more introspective David Almond, Marshall writes short but intense stories focusing on everything from basic spinechilling to complex philosophy.<br />Something nasty and carnivorous is lurking in &quot;The Garage,&quot; while &quot;Come, Dream With Me&quot; hints at the strange, frightening results of a recurring dream. &quot;The Bus, the Night, the Street&quot; gives a somber glimpse of a young man venturing into the streets, where shadowy things are lurking. &quot;Grief&quot; is a touching glimpse of what happens when a man's wife dies, and his sorrowful actions and thoughts as he remembers her. &quot;Whistling in the Dark&quot; features a strange, eerie apartment where things come alive in frightening ways. A slick, debonair &quot;Stranger&quot; offers a man what he longs for most -- in exchange for his soul. &quot;The Meanest Man in Town And the Haunted House&quot; features an obnoxious guy insisting that he be taken to the haunted Hardwick Farm, where graves swallow the living.<br />The title story is somewhat different from the other stories, in which a guy has an intense discussion about various issues, with a girl with whom he has a special connection. &quot;The Stranger -- Again&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Stranger,&quot; in which Mr. Mephistopheles brings a familiar stranger into the narrator's presence. &quot;Aren't You Gerald Sweeney?&quot; is the opening line of a story where an elderly man meets the narrator of &quot;Stranger,&quot; and the two have a long talk about this world, and the divine world.

And in the sequel to &quot;Gerald Sweeney,&quot; called &quot;Joseph's Sadness,&quot; in which Joseph reappears to speak to the narrator about kindness and selflessness.<br />Marshall's stories range from very inward-centered vignettes to atmospheric glimpses to some really creepy, horrific stories. His writing style suggests a more flowing David Almond with hints of Ray Bradbury, especially the creepy apartment and the hauntingly eerie alleyway in &quot;Bus.&quot; There's also some religious dimension as well, in the &quot;Stranger&quot; stories and &quot;Gerald Sweeney.&quot; Some of the stories have a definite beginning and end, while some are more like slices from a person's own experience, but all have a certain haunting, otherworldly quality.<br />Marshall's stories are an enjoyable read, especially for those who enjoy a surreal tint to their reading material.

The problems are that not only is Kate unstable and weird, but also is heading off on an expedition into the Amazon jungle to find a sort of jungle yeti called \\"the Beast.\\" Alexander befriends Nadia, the daughter of the guide, who teaches him about the wildlife and the natives of the Amazon. But soon they discover that the jungle and the mysterious \\"People of the Mist\\" are in danger from the expedition.<br /><br />One of the worst things about this book is the fact that Allende seems to keep in mind constantly that she is writing for kids. A good book can be appreciated by adults and kids alike; you don't have to dumb it down. But dumb it down she does -- she seems to think that not only is her audience young, but also stupid and tasteless. For example, there's a language barrier between Alexander and the People. No problem -- he just \\"listens with his heart\\" and the language thing isn't a problem. I'll have to remember that when I travel abroad. The backhistory of the \\"Beasts\\" is excruciatingly stupid (and boring), as is the frantic conspiracy that Allende rigs up near the end.<br /><br />Alex is dull to the extreme, especially since halfway through the book he sheds all his doubts and fears and becomes Super-Jaguarboy. Nadia is apparently supposed to be a magical, quirky girl, but her constant New-Age lectures and preening bog her down (especially her women-ARE-nature line). Kate seems like a semi-abusive creep, and the professor is a sexist, racist, arrogant, bigoted pain-in-the-backside who is so ridiculous that you can't take him seriously; Allende was trying way too hard to make him unsympathetic. All military personnel and \\"modern\\" people are destructive, thick, and whiny. Every Indian is serene, otherworldly, attuned to nature -- in other words, boring and cliched.<br /><br />Additionally, none of the characters act like actual human beings; at one point, a member of the party is shot through the heart with a poison dart. Instead of being sad, frightened, or defensive, our very dense heroes stand around and debate about funeral rites. Elsewhere, Alexander contemplates his raging hormones -- really, \\"raging,\\" you could have fooled me. The boy is as juiceless as a raisin. The plotline itself is halting, jerky and boring (there's that word again). Enormous stretches of the book are devoted to travelling on the river, or hanging out with the \\"People of the Mist.\\" (That's right, let's tell the kids that ritual cannibalism and interbreeding polygamy are just fine) During these times, the other plotlines (like scheming adventurers or dying mothers) are completely dropped, only to be yanked back up a few hundred pages later. And Allende eagerly trots out every bit of trivia she knows about the Indians and wildlife of the Amazon jungles, meaning that the action stops dead whenever she wants to lecture us about piranhas.<br /><br />Perhaps the most unforgivable aspect of it is the preachiness, since every other page Allende reminds us how wonderful nature is and how we should live in tune with it and not destroy anything. Then maybe she shouldn't have kept showing us what a nightmare hole the Amazon is, or showed us a supposedly sympathetic character murdering an animal to \\"set it free,\\" apparently out of the belief that it is better off dead than getting the royal treatment at a zoo. She never makes us feel any awe or love for nature, or any real urgency to conserve the wild places of the world.<br /><br />If you or your kids want a beautiful, well-written, well-characterized story that shows us why we should protect forests and animals and wild places, read T.A. Barron's books, especially \\"The Ancient One.\\" His stories are exquisite, and the message about nature and conservation goes straight to the heart. Allende's book is only useful if you need some paper for your fireplace.ll-written, well-characterized story that shows us why we should protect forests and animals and wild places, read T.A.

But Ray Bradbury's \\"Dandelion Wine\\" is similar to what it's named after: It's a magical summery substance trapped in a bottle -- or, in this case, a book. This is not the 1928 of bathtub gin and flappers, it's about a little boy in the Midwest.<br />It begins with the advent of summer. Douglas Spalding ses himself in summer -- dandelion wine, charting the little things of life, running through the woods with Tom, buying new sneakers and staying out until dark. It is about a man who builds a machine to make people happy, but only makes those around him miserable instead. It is about an old woman who tries to convince little children that she was once like them. There are haunted ravines, visions of Paris, wild runs in the woods, mingled with the bittersweet shadows of summers past.<br />Ray Bradbury is one of those few writers who actually seems to remember what it's like to be a kid. Douglas is an endearing boy, who manages to be innocent, enthusiastic and full of awe without making me feel sick to my stomach. The supporting characters are also as bright and real as actual people; none of them are flat or cartoonish. You could imagine driving into any town in Illinois and bumping into people like this: shop owners, mothers, reclusive old ladies, kindly grandfathers, bright young boys who specialize in creeping around soundlessly, and weary farmers.<br />Bradbury's writing is, in technical terms, not very good. But it is exceptional in that it sucks you in and makes you see and feel and experience everything in the book. There's no solid plotline, rather there are several plot threads that interweave and cling together (like the Happiness Machine, something which is supposed to give you visions and sensations that will make you happy). It's written with the sort of innocent view of a child, and children can definitely read this. If they are patient and don't mind a lack of slapstick or bang-bang action, then this book will definitely be appreciated. Adults too. And definitely anyone who was ten years old in 1928.lapstick or bang-bang action, then this book will definitely be appreciated. Adults too.

(For example, the Florida state seal shows a mosquito with a machine gun, and Iowa's Official State Motto is &quot;You Bet!&quot;) He also handles other North American countries like Canada (which has cold air masses) and Mexico (Unit of Currency: The Lambada). He also briefly forays to Europe, where he lampoons various countries in turn.  (Instructions: How to use a bidet) Then it's staying in a hotel, and if that isn't awful enough, camping out.<br />If you have a deep-rooted hate of airport security personnel, or you hate camping, or you hate being shortchanged in Austria, then this book is for you. Keep on writing, Mr. Barry, but you may want to rethink the book tours...	2003-01-15

But before that came the charmingly-written classic by Carlo Collodi, now reissued by the Starscape book line alongside more contemporary fantasy.<br />An elderly woodcutter named Geppetto has an unusual piece of wood -- one that, when carved into a puppet, can move and speak. He names this strange puppet \\"Pinocchio,\\" and has barely finished when he's arrested. Pinocchio may be able to speak and move and think for himself, but he's also a bit of a pain, as Geppetto finds when he returns home. Like any boy (wooden or not), Pinocchio has good points and bad points -- and he has some hard lessons to learn before he can gain what he wants most.<br />It's a charming tale, though not really of the same type as the much-beloved movie. The book is both more entertaining and a lot darker. The characters aren't perfect; they have a lot to learn and accomplish, and one entertaining scene has Geppetto and a carpenter duking it out. Pinocchio will alternately annoy and endear himself to the readers, like a real kid would. One minute you're sorry for him because he burned off his feet, and the next you want to smack him because of his picky eating habits.<br />The writing style is really charming, alternately humorous and serious; there isn't a lot of detail, although the illustrations may make up for that. Dry wit pervades almost every part of the book, especially the opening page. The plot definiteIy definitely is darker than the cartoon, with more scenes connected with death and violence, such as a pair of assassins hanging Pinocchio. But probably kids will be able to handle it; this is and has always been a children's book.<br />Gris Grimly's drawings seem, overall, to suit the story of Pinocchio -- they can be grim and a little weird, and can also be much softer and sweeter. Depends on who's in it. Some are a little jagged and surreal, while some are outright pretty. Weird? Yes. Twisted? Definitely. Fitting? Absolutely.<br />\\"Pinocchio\\" is an unusually good children's classic with a well-written storyline and an alternately loveable/irritating hero. Definitely worth checking out.itely. Fitting?

Then there are movie titles where some of the letters/words flickered out (\\"Ear of Living Dangerously,\\" \\"Bugs Lie\\"), and then this little volume rounds off with a last spattering of weird signs (\\"GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS -- Live Shoes Daily,\\" and \\"Free Drinks for Ladies With Nuts\\").<br />Perhaps the main letdown of this book is that occasionally, perhaps as filler, O'Boyle has to grab some not-as-funny items from English, like the movie titles.

If you find the idea of people offing themselves by their own idiotic actions to be horrifying rather than funny, this is not the book for you. If, however, you think \\"Well, if they were stupid enough...\\" then this may be for you.<br />In it, you'll find stories of a man who dove off a rooftop into four feet of water, an idiot who tried to lift a power line from his car, an old woman who chased three runaway Christmas trees into a highway, people who sleep in dumpsters -- which are then emptied into trash compactors, a guy who checked inside a gas can with a lighter, a religious fanatic standing in traffic, a guy choked to death by a very adventurous fish, a wannabe-rapist whose testicles were bitten off by his victim, a man who dove off a cliff and was rescued by the boys he was trying to impress, a man who drowned in a vat of beer, and many others. Most memorable is the guy who tried to molest a porcupine.<br />Perhaps the only problem is that sometimes the winners aren't really stupid, just unlucky.

It's funny, cute, informative, and gives lots of easy-to-understand tips and translations. This is way better than Cliffs' Notes, especially since it gives you plenty of reasons to read the actual plays.<br />The first few chapters are devoted to Shakespeare's life, the who-was-Shakespeare-really? debate,  his theaters, and some stuff about Elizabethan slang terms. Then it goes to the plays themselves. It gives background info on the time period and how it shaped the plays (for example, views on marriage for \\"Taming of the Shrew\\"), a cast list, a pretty good plot summary, and then some mild literary analysis.<br />Sprinkled on every page are bits of trivia about the plays, the writing, and the time period -- they're not really part of the reviews, just side tidbits. Additionally, they include a chart of Shakespeare's dirty language, a lot of funny jokes, and even reviews of the various movie adaptations (all the major ones -- good, bad, and really, really weird!). There are also pics from various movies/plays, featuring major actors like Patrick Stewart, Elizabeth Taylor, and the all-star cast of the fantastic recent \\"Much Ado About Nothing.\\"<br />This is a must-read for Shakespeare buffs and newbies (especially if you don't understand what's going on).

It's a little darker, a little differently-written, but a great read for people with enough patience.<br />Westerly's mother was killed by gunmen, and he escaped through a door into a strange land, with three magical bones. Calliope, a girl with strange thick skin on her hands, watches her parents waste away with a strange illness and leave her alone,and she slips through a mirror to the same land. When Cally encounters West, he is trying to escape from the ruthless, cold-hearted Lady Taranis.<br />A kindly stranger named Lugan seems to be their best hope for escaping Taranis. As the two travellers cross the world that is an echo of our own, they encounter strange creatures such as the sealpeople (selkies), a talking insect that guides them over a desert, creatures made of stone, and the haunting specters of their own pasts and destinies...<br />\\"Seaward\\" seems like a pretty simple story at first, but in that simple storyline Cooper tackles questions about death and life, about grief, about good and evil. Westerly's guilt over his mother's death and Cally's opportunity to be with the selkies are beautifully drawn. Her writing is dreamy, lush, but thankfully never becomes overwrought.<br />Cally and West are very alike, very confused and lacking in understanding, but drawn \\"seaward\\" and both dealing with grief. Taranis comes across as very childlike and petulant, while Lugan is paternal and kindly. There aren't many supporting characters, but the Stonecutter is pretty unnerving, and Peth is endearing and sad.<br />Probably the biggest stumbling block in \\"Seaward\\" is the slightly dreamy tone of it all. Unlike the \\"Dark is Rising\\" books, there is no grounded \\"homey\\" base -- it's all like a legend right from the beginning. As a result, it takes awhile for the story to really get going, and there are long stretches where the characters are just walking. There's no cursing or violence, although there is one scene where Cally and West experience some pretty strong physical attraction (though nothing happens). Their romance is a little abrupt as well, although hardly unexpected; in fact, it's pretty sweet.<br />\\"Seaward\\" is a fantastic story, with likeable characters and a deceptively simple storyline.

While it has a lot of the Bellairs staples (meek young boy, eccentric buddy, evil adversary), it doesn't have any horror or supernatural elements. Despite that, it's an enjoyable little mystery with a twist at the end.<br />To get away from his money-obsessed mother, Anthony Monday accepts a job working with his friend Miss Eells at the library. But when he's dusting, he accidently uncovers clues to the seemingly hidden treasure of late millionaire Alpheus Winterborn. Though Miss Eells doesn't think the clues are anything but a joke, she helps Anthony hunt for the treasure. But Hugo Philpotts, the sinister nephew of old Winterborn, is also searching for the treasure.<br />At about this time, Anthony's father suffers a heart attack that temporarily makes him unable to wor. Terrified that his family is going to run out of money, Anthony becomes obsessed with finding Winterborn's treasure. And when Philpotts threatens his father's business, Anthony finds that he has only a few days to find the treasure...<br />Even if this isn't a horror book, it's a pretty good mystery. Bellairs did a good job with staples like hidden treasure, clues in a poem, the sinister relative and so on. There's that distinct, slightly unreal flavor of a child's daydream in his books, like this is the imagined adventure of a boy on a summer day. And even though there are no monstrous spiders or cackling sorcerers, the discoveries near the end make up for that. Action fans will especially enjoy a tense scene on a rainy rooftop near the finale.<br />Anthony Monday is a little darker in some ways than Bellairs' more popular heroes (Johnny Dixon and  Lewis Barnavelt), but he's very much in the same mold. Nice, quiet, unassuming, extremely loyal and normally very honest. Miss Eells, a ladylike librarion who can curse like a sailor (don't worry, parents, Bellairs never makes it clear just what she says), makes a good foil as the voice of experience and reason. And Philpotts becomes a little more ridiculous as the book goes on, but is an expert manipulator and very realistic.<br />I read this book expecting some thrills and chills, but didn't get many \\"chills.\\" Despite that, one of Bellairs' few straight mysteries is good Gothic fun.he voice of experience and reason.

His stories are funny, heartwarming, sad, and highly educational. And after reading this, you will either want to be a vet or be very grateful that you aren't one.<br />The book opens (after a brief chapter taking place several months later) with James arriving in Yorkshire, to be the assistant to the eccentric but kindly Siegfried Farnon (yes, that is his name).  He becomes accustomed to Siegfried, Siegfried's mischievous younger brother Tristan (yes, that is his name), and the gruff, kindly farmers who eke out a living in the Yorkshire Dales. Pampered pooches who are spoiled rotten, savage pigs who chase Tristan around the farm, a nightmarishly strict secretary who drives Siegfried up the wall, James's car-with-no-brakes, cows running on three cylinders, a sadistic vet who makes James wear a rubber bodysuit, and an elderly, immensely wealthy widow who adopts a pig. And through this, James falls in love with the beautiful Helen Alderson and worms his way into the trust of the farmers.<br />James Herriot (real name, James Wight) was truly a one-of-a-kind man. He let readers into his head throughout the book, where the cows kick him across the yard, farmers often treat him as an interloper or a nuisance, and his boss gives contradicting orders from one day to the next. But he never loses his drive or his love of animals. (Okay, he hates some animals, but only as individuals) He even lets the readers see him at his worst, when he's humiliated by some recalcitrant livestock, and one horrible scene where he and his date show up drunk and mud-smeared in front of the girl he adores. (Not to mention when Tristan got him to use very feminine-smelling bath salts) But don't think that all of these stories are funny or romantic -- quite a few are aggravating or outright sad. James didn't soften the blows at all.<br />The people around James are just as fantastic: Siegfried, his weird but genial boss who can kick Tristan out of the house and forget about it overnight; Tristan, the mischievous anti-scholar who usually manages to keep out of trouble; and Helen, who seems a little too saintly at times (which isn't surprising, since James married her). There are a lot of details about surgery and stuff like that that will gross out the squeamish, but at least you'll learn a lot of medical trivia. (For example, what is a torsion?)<br />It's sweet, sad, funny, romantic, dramatic. \\"All Creatures Great And Small\\" (and its four sequels) is a fantastic read for all ages.eird but genial boss who can kick Tristan out of the house and forget about it overnight; Tristan, the mischievous anti-scholar who usually manages to keep out of trouble; and Helen, who seems a little too saintly at times (which isn't surprising, since James married her).

Jude Fisher follows up with the &quot;Two Towers Visual Companion,&quot; to give readers little bits and pieces that aren't quite in the movies.<br />Fisher goes over the various people, places, and occasionally new races that are introduced in &quot;Two Towers.&quot; She doesn't recap much stuff from the previous movie, so if you want to fully understand this book, pick up the &quot;Fellowship&quot; guide first. It's sprinkled with plenty of bright pictures, usually several for each character, and background information that will be new to some who've only watched the movie. (For example, the tale of Beren and Luthien is contrasted to Aragorn and Arwen's involvement, and Gollum's history is spelled out in greater detail). Fans will definitely want to check out the pictures of Treebeard, Grima Wormtongue, and the battle of Helm's Deep.<br />It's sort of a guidebook to Middle-Earth, and so mainly the areas of greatest activity are shown. That means not a lot of hobbit stuff. However, there's a great fold-out map of the Helm's Deep Battle, and a very poetic foreword by actor Viggo Mortenson in which he praises Jude Fisher and briefly analyzes the depths of &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; (Mortenson's literary skill is never more evident than it is here)<br />This book is primarily intended for people who haven't read the books, but longtime fans may enjoy it as well.	2002-12-25

The first book was restricted in what it showed the production of -- in other words, it showed production mainly of the first movie. This book includes stuff from the first AND second movies, a slew of new photos and information, and real-world reactions to the first movie.<br />The book starts with a description of what the stars did on the night of the movie's world premiere, then snaps back to when Peter Jackson first began the journey to create \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" The parts on costumes, sets, locations and CGI have been expanded to include Two Towers as well (there's an entire chapter devoted to making Brad Dourif into Grima Wormtongue). There's information on dressing Eowyn, creating Treebeard, baking lembas, and -- of course -- the creation of CGI masterpiece Gollum. Even little details, such as the moth that Gandalf uses as a messenger, are dealt with.<br />There are dozens of pictures, ranging from the exquisite (pictures of people working on the \\"bigatures,\\" Treebeard, and the intricate costumes) to the awkward (Legolas in mid-war-scream, Elijah Wood gnawing on his fingertip). The bonuses include quotes from the actors on their costars and a hilarious interview with Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd (\\"I need a hug!\\" \\"Not NOW!\\") in which they comment on the sexiness of their hobbit armor, the maturation of their characters, and Billy falling into a cactus. And actor Ian McKellen writes a brief but sprightly foreword in which he talks about Sibley's \\"Making of\\" guide and the making of the movie itself, and the impact it's had. (And it has a plug for his website!)<br />It's an entertaining and informative look behind-the-scenes for anyone who enjoyed the movie and wanted to know \\"How was that done?

David Almond's fifth book is a haunting look at an unusual young boy, written beautifully and with fantastic, memorable characters. It occasionally becomes a little confusing and repetitive, but the characterizations are stunning, and overall it's a great read.<br />Joe Maloney is a dreamer, a shy stutterer whose mother works shifts at a bar and whose father \\"spun the waltzer at a fair.\\" His teachers want him to study, but he can't. His former friend, Stanny Mole, has fallen in with a ruthless creep called Joff, and wants to show Joe how to kill -- but Joe doesn't want to. And he sees visions of a tiger prowling around, but there are no tigers where he lives.<br />He makes his way to the circus, which is due to shut down in a few days. There he meets an enormous wrestler, an old woman who sees into people's souls -- and Corinna, an acrobat with whom he shares a mysterious bond. These strange people will help him learn how to find his way around the people who taunt and try to mold him, and about the tiger inside him.<br />This may be Almond's most confusing book. It starts off in a rather colorless way, except for the interludes where Joe sees the tiger. Almond's stark prose becomes much more flowery halfway through, when Joe meets up with the circus people; it lends itself to a few genuinely nauseating interludes where we see the sort of killing that Joff urges boys to do, claiming that it will make men out of them. But there's no hamhanded moralizing in this book, thankfully. The last third is very surreal, very strange and otherworldly, but those who don't demand a concrete answer for everything in a book will be fine with that. The biggest problem is that at times it gets a little repetitive, with people shouting the same insults after Joe and Corinna, and Joe wondering for the umpteenth time whether Joff is his father.<br />Joe is likeable from the start, a kid who doesn't really fit anywhere and who feels pressure from all sides to be something he isn't. His patient mother is an almost saintly figure; the circus performers range from the surreal to the everyday, but all are friendly and kind, especially the blind old lady Nanty.  Corinna is somewhat like Joe, except more outgoing and less sensitive to the taunts of others. And if there's a villain, it's Joff, a murdering tough who tries to mold boys to be like him, including Joe's friend Stanny (who pretty clearly doesn't believe a word coming out of his own mouth).<br />This is not a book for everyone -- the boundaries are very hazy and the storyline stretches into fantasy. But it's beautifully written and strangely plotted, and definitely worth the read.atient mother is an almost saintly figure; the circus performers range from the surreal to the everyday, but all are friendly and kind, especially the blind old lady Nanty.

Sometimes he lifts a fragment of a sentence, sometimes a whole paragraph -- but he always keeps it in the right place.

Three young adult books that, the publishers continually remind us, can be read by the parents as well as the kids. Whether they're masters of the surreal or the horrific, these authors have produced some weird and wacky books, and it's quite a mixed bag.<br />\\"Coraline\\" is Neil Gaiman's chilling foray into Young Adult lit, a deceptively skinny book about the grimly resourceful Coraline, a little girl who finds herself in a battle with her clawed, button-eyed \\"other mother,\\" who has abducted her parents and threatens Coraline as well...<br />\\"Abarat\\" is one of Clive Barker's few delvings into children's lit, and the result is not entirely satisfactory. Candy Quackenbush (nice name...) tries to escape her small-town life, with her alcoholic father and depressed mother -- but she stumbles onto a twenty-five island chain called Abarat, where every island (but one) represents an hour of the day, and two devious rivals are trying to take control.<br />\\"City of the Beasts\\" is, like \\"Coraline,\\" Isabel Allende's first tiptoe into young adult lit, and the strain shows. Young Alexander Cold is sent to stay with his chilly grandmother, who is venturing into the jungles in search of a mythical \\"Beast.\\" He and his friend Nadia begin a strange journey into a magical realm.<br />Some authors, like Gaiman and his fellow authors Michael Chabon and Carl Hiaasen, manage to deftly and easily shift into the young adult/children's realm of literature. Some of their contemporaries, however, don't succeed because of the constant awareness that they're writing for children. One thing to always recognize is that a good novel is a good novel, and that children can read and comprehend on the same level as adults. (Just keep it nice and clean!)<br />\\"Coraline\\" is spooky, creepy, grotesque and a delightful read for people who like a few gruesome thrills. Gaiman gets a little stilted at times, but otherwise he manages to keep it flowing nicely along with the likeable heroine. Barker does a pretty good job, but often he doesn't really feel like he's writing for kids; it gets fairly gruesome and dark in places. The pictures are pleasant to look at, though. And Allende falls flat on her face with \\"City,\\" scrabbling to get her Big Message across (basically, it's: Save the Rainforest) as she hits readers with stilted dialogue, two-dimensional characters, and utterly laughable plot developments. Someone needs to tell Allende that the kiddies appreciate quality too.<br />Gaiman is good, Barker is okay, and Allende needs to read some young adult lit before she tries writing it.

No intelligent, logical person who dislikes the Harry Potter books would make any of the assertions that Neal claims to answer; perhaps this is because her arguments are juvenile at best. To make a bad situation worse, she also claims that somehow she is gifted with God-given insight to tell people about the Potter books. Very nice of God to do that for her. From someone with God-given insight, I'd expect a little more clarity, coherence, objectivity, and less fangirl drooling.<br /><br />I would also wonder why genuine practices (like fortune-telling, astrology, the Hand of Glory) and genuine mythologic items (such as the Grim) are never gone into in-depth, especially since the majority of those practices are at odds with what most Christians believe to be acceptable. But that would undermine Neal's message, and so it's never covered. Nor does she include any sort of objectivity in things like the death of Harry's mother -- it's a great sacrifice, yes, but hardly to be compared to the death of Christ in the Bible. Rather, it should be taken merely at its own value, the death of a mother for her son. Nothing more, nothing less.<br /><br />Perhaps her biggest flaw is in her apparent devotion to the Potter series. Hers can hardly be considered an unbiased viewpoint, as she clearly considers the potentially problematic points to be easily brushed aside, and doesn't dwell on any flaws or weaknesses in Rowling's characters. That is not what a scholar and a writer does -- that is what a hysterical teenybopper fan does. She also, like many uninformed people, insists on holding the Potter books up to Lord of the Rings and Narnia, both classic series that have been dissected and reevaluated for years and have not been found wanting by critics, either Christians or non-Christians. To claim that Harry Potter is in the class of the first major fantasies ever is more than a little presumptuous.<br /><br />\\"What's a Christian To Do With Harry Potter?\\" is basically a waste of paper, a defensive love-note to the Harry Potter series.

Wrong! Debra Doyle and James MacDonald take a typical sword'n'sorcery tale (heavier on the swords) and spin it into a slam-bang adventure tale that will definitely cause thrills and chills for both kids and adults.<br />In one of the dukedoms of Anglia, young William is about to be knighted, which is theoretically one of the best days of his life. But it's overshadowed when a wizard tells him his wyrd -- his future destiny -- that he won't succeed his father because he will encounter Death before a year has passed. Horrified, William sets off on a perilous journey to tell his betrothed, Isobel, that he can't marry her because he's going to die.<br />But his preoccupation with his impending death is overshadowed when he finds out about political machinations that threaten his life. And with a dubious circle of allies around him -- from an indebted ghost to a cryptic dragon to some murky mermaids -- William must somehow defeat the deathless ogre whose fate is somehow entwined with his -- and with Lord Death's.<br />\\"Knight's Wyrd\\" is pretty standard and only somewhat engaging for the first two thirds of the book, then it rapidly respins itself into a complex and thought-provoking action-fantasy. Shapeshifting wizards, carnivore mermaids, and an ex-fiancee who is not quite what she seems add an element of mystery. To make the book even more interesting, Doyle and MacDonald subtlely include elements of medieval honor and debt.<br />The writing is stark but very evocative, which gives an extra punch to scenes like the one where Will kneels down, only to find a ghost on either side of him. There's no swearing or smut, but there is a lot of darkness and violence, ranging from a hideous long-armed troll being dragged out of a river to the sharp-toothed mermaids trying to eat Will. Younger kids will probably find this frightening, but older kids will enjoy a fantasy story with some genuinely gruesome beasties -- not to mention the appearance of Lord Death himself, who adds the final kink to a very complicated plot.<br />\\"Knight's Wyrd\\" is a dark, fun, intense read for both kids and adults.

To be precise, concept drawings and sketches of costumes, places, and bizarre inhuman creatures all through the stages of their creation.<br />We're given in-depth studies of places like Rivendell, Lothlorien, Bag End, Bree, and the various sketches of what worked and what didn't (such as a tree-dwelling in Lothlorien that looks like a hatrack with lanterns on it). The costumes: the simplicity of the little hobbit outfits, the Byzantine splendor of Boromir's garb, the ultra-elaborate Elven costumes of Arwen and Elrond, and the spiky armor of Sauron from the beginning of the film. There's a section on weaponry, on the various incarnations of Narsil, Sting, and Legolas's quiver. There are glimpses of the various orcs, how they evolved from almost ratlike creatures to steel-jawed monstrosities to the ugly things in the movie; of the evolving appearance of the Ringwraiths (one of whom looked eerily like Emperor Palpatine); of the Balrog and the tentacled Watcher (who is shown in his various states). And captioning nearly every photograph is an insightful comment from the appropriate person who worked on that, be it costuming, weapons, or CGI.<br />There are all sorts of goodies for people who liked the visual richness of \\"Fellowship of the Ring.\\" Concept art is always great to look at, and seeing all sorts of subtle variations on stuff in the movie -- like the floorplan of Bag End -- is absolutely wonderful. Sometimes there are several, even dozens of concept sketches, like the various incarnations of the Watcher (a really gross squidlike thing that looks almost spiderlike at times), weapons, and even dozens of pipes!<br />Perhaps the main drawback of this book is that the costume part is a little (pardon the pun) sketchy. Each character (with the exception of Arwen and Galadriel) gets a page at best, half a page at worst. There are usually only a couple of sketches of clothing, and we never get to see how, for example, Aragorn's outfit evolved. But this is somewhat made up for by the glimpses of Sauron's various armor types.<br />\\"Art\\" is a fantastic book of concept sketches.

While suspenseful and intriguing, it doesn't really have a good sense of the epic or the atmospheric. But author Alan Garner definitely gets points for his subtle use of Celtic mythology and managing to create a believable unicorn.<br />Four kids exploring a wrecked church accidently venture into another world, the mysterious realm of Elidor. There, young Roland encounters a mysterious wounded man who sends him into a castle, claiming that he can save all of Elidor. After Roland frees his siblings from a spell, the man gives them a stone, a spear, a sword, and a cauldron, and they are sent back to their own world to guard these items from evil forces.<br />But problems arise when the kids go home and hide the items: The power that they emanate is so intense that it disrupts electricity and radio signals, causing problems all over their town. They bury the objects -- but that's only a temporary measure. The strange situation grows stranger when armed warriors appear near the buried objects, and an Ouija board displays the name \\"Findhorn\\" and a picture of a unicorn...<br />One of the wonderful things about Garner's Alderly duology is that when strange people and things were encountered by our heroes, it made our world seem like almost a parallel universe. It made everything seem magic. That quality is somewhat lacking in \\"Elidor\\"; the opening chapters have a promising glimpse of Elidor, but unfortunately this is never exploited. The evil force is another problem; unlike in the Alderly books, the evil is never given a face or an identity, and so it seems a little difficult to really get upset about.<br />Despite this, the opening and final chapters show Garner's lyrical style, and all of it displays his keen sense of plot development. The descriptions of the electrical disruptions are almost surreal, and his descriptions of Elidor are outstanding. So is his usage of Celtic mythology, though to a lesser extent than his other children's books; the dialogue ranges from chirpy British-schoolchild conversation to the formal language of the Elidor inhabitants. And don't be afraid of the portrayal of the unicorn -- Garner shies away from all the cliches.<br />It's not really a lightweight read, but \\"Elidor\\" is a beautifully written little tale that will thrill fantasy readers.

Not that that's a bad thing -- Alexander's plot is intriguing, fresh, and has plenty of lovable and complex people.<br />Lidi is an excellent magician, but there is one magic trick that she doesn't know: The fabled rope trick.  She and her kindly mentor Jericho rescue a neglected orphan from an abusive innkeeper, and find that little Daniella can predict the future. No sooner have the two made her an \\"Added Attraction\\" (she predicted that too) than they encounter a young outlaw named Julian sleeping under their wagon. A scuffle with soldiers sends them on the run to another province.<br />There they bump into many different people who have encountered the strange magician Ferramondo, who is seen differently by every person. He also knows the rope trick. Lidi begins a desperate search for Ferramondo, convinced that she will not be a true magician until she does. But sinister men are trying to get hold of Daniella for their own gain, and Julian is seeking revenge against \\"Baboon,\\" the man who killed his uncle and drove him to become an outlaw.<br />This book is somewhat different from most of Alexander's books. The protagonist is a young girl rather than a boy (even the Vesper Holly books were narrated by a man) with a sad past, and there are more serious, melancholy themes. Julian in particular is a break from Alexander's naive young heroes-in-training, who learn their lessons along the way. It's also full of more introspection, as Lidi often stops to contemplate herself and others. The love story between Lidi and Julian is handled with delicacy, and goes very gradually over the book.<br />Perhaps the biggest problem is the finale. It's more than a little difficult to understand why what happens does happen, as it doesn't really seem to be entirely connected to the plotline behind it. It is, however, an interesting development and opens possible paths to a sequel; the various subplots are woven together like... well, like a rope. Alexander's writing is spare but amazingly evocative, and his dialogue is full of the same pep and charm as ever.<br />Fans of Lloyd Alexander will find an enjoyable tale of magic and mystery, and newcomers will enjoy this introduction to Alexander's work.

Craig Shaw Gardner spins another winning tale in the first part of the Wuntvor trilogy, sequel to the Ebenezum trilogy. Old characters return and new ones pop up as Wuntvor desperately tries to save the world from the Netherhells, with the help of an oaf with a magic club, an amorous unicorn, a trio of demons, a talkative brownie, a Dragon and a Damsel, and a ferret.<br />After the events of \\"Night in the Netherhells,\\" Wuntvor and Co. are safe. At first. Then it's discovered that Ebenezum's allergy to magic has spread to every wizard in Vushta. To make matters worse, Guxx Unfunfadoo has been deposed as Grand Hoohah, and soon the world will be Conquered by Committee.  As the wizards puzzle out what to do, Wuntvor tries to deal with the animosity of some very large, angry apprentice wizards and the affections of dancing damsel Alea and jealous witch Norei. (Also the unicorn, who lusts after \\"Wuntie\\"'s lap.)<br />The wizards decide to send Wuntvor on a journey to the Eastern kingdoms, where giants reportedly eat people, and which is ruled by Mother Duck. (Yes, Mother Duck -- Gardner ventures into fairy-tale territory in this one) He's soon being confronted by Death, who announces that he is the \\"Eternal Apprentice\\" -- he'll reincarnate a thousand times as the quintessential apprentice, but Death can claim him if he is ever alone. The problem for Death is, Wuntvor has more than enough company: the exiled Guxx and Brax, the irritating Brownie, Snarks the truthful demon, Hendrek and his club, overamorous Alea and her singing dragon, and the pushy unicorn. Can Wuntvor keep from being claimed by death -- either by being alone, or by being eaten on pumpernickel?<br />Gardner's golden touch is turning to platinum in this book. His talents for kooky characters and overcomplicated conversations are getting better as time goes on. Perhaps the biggest problem with \\"Difficulty With Dwarves\\" is that it ends with a \\"to be continued.\\" (The dwarves mentioned in the title are the \\"seven OTHER dwarves,\\" including but not limited to Sickly, Nasty, Spacey, Smarmy... you get the idea)<br />Poor Wuntvor is still trying to keep up with events around him, and Ebenezum is trying to decide what to do (he makes another appearance inside a giant shoe). To really understand the cast of characters (oh yes, Cuthbert the cowardly sword appears as well) you have to read the Ebenezum trilogy. It's complex and outstandingly funny, with plenty of jumbled dialogue that never trips over itself. Ever seen a bumbling, inexplicably attractive hero defeat a giant with a magical toothpick? That's what you'll see here.<br />Fans of fantasy and fairy tales will enjoy seeing the staples of both being relentlessly spoofed in \\"Difficulty with Dwarves,\\" and will be left bouncing with anticipation for the next book.n OTHER dwarves,\\" including but not limited to Sickly, Nasty, Spacey, Smarmy... you get the idea)<br />Poor Wuntvor is still trying to keep up with events around him, and Ebenezum is trying to decide what to do (he makes another appearance inside a giant shoe).

One of the early fantasy writers, Dunsany only wrote a few full-length novels -- one of which was the haunting, beautifully-written \\"Charwoman's Shadow.\\" (And if anyone thinks that J.K. Rowling made up the immortality elixir and \\"philosopher/sorcerer's stone,\\" they better read this!)<br />Ramon Alonzo is a young Spanish nobleman sent to find a dowry for his sister Mirandola. He goes to a powerful magician to learn alchemy -- how to turn dross into gold. The magician agrees, at a price: Ramon Alonzo's shadow. At first he's inclined to give up his shadow, but an elderly charwoman warns him not to. She gave up her shadow, and now is shunned by everyone except the magician because if her contact with dark magic.<br />Eventually Ramon Alonzo agrees to give up his shadow in exchange for a replacement, which turns out to be a dud. His attempts at magic for his sister's sake begin to go horribly wrong, and he finds his very soul in peril as he struggles to fulfil his promise to the charwoman, and get back both of their shadows.<br />Most of Dunsany's fantasy stories are set in fictional lands full of magic and wizards and gods. This one is slightly different, as it is set in a sort of semi-fictional part of Spain, and magic is something which seeps naturally to great evil. But the entire world it's set in has the same sort of fantastical edge that his books usually do. Kids with a good attention span can read this, though some may be bored by the gradual pace and flowery language. And the language is very flowery. Dunsany writes in his standard dreamy prose, with a lot of very strange imagery (like the charwoman scrubbing a bloodstained floor stone, or Ramon Alonzo's fake shadow getting up and racing away).<br />Ramon Alonzo is a nice leading character -- he's a good guy who gets enmeshed in bad things for good reasons. His spiritual struggle and chivalrous rescue of the charwoman Anemone and her shadow are central to the plot. Anemone herself remains a mystery for most of the book, although one development is rather obvious early on. The magician is a cold, unsympathetic character who \\"scorns salvation\\" and shows no pity to someone he's wronged. Father Joseph serves as the counterbalance for the magician, a kindly priest who helps Ramon Alonzo out.<br />A beautiful story about love, magic, and kindness, this is a must-read for fans of classic fantasy.

If Michael Chabon is any indicator, then you venture into the jungle of kids' fantasy. Written because his daughter isn't yet old enough to read his previous works, Chabon's first kids' book is an entertaining blend of fantasy, folklore, and... well, baseball.<br />Ethan Feld doesn't like baseball, and he's about the only person in the idyllic Clam Island who doesn't. So he's more than slightly confused with a bushbaby-like werefox called Cutbelly takes him through the Tree that connects all the worlds, to the Summerland. There, a race of American-Indian-like \\"ferishers\\" are being threatened by the villainous Coyote, who is trying to destroy the Tree -- and everyone on it. And a giant clam (yes, you read correctly) has predicted that Ethan will be the one to help the ferishers. (And somehow it involves baseball)<br />Then the hideous graylings massacre the ferishers, leaving only the chieftain Cinquefoil behind. And Ethan's father is kidnapped by Coyote, who wants Mr. Feld's airship secrets to help him, well, destroy the world. With the help of his best friend Jennifer T., Cinquefoil, a pleasant Sasquatch and others, he sets out to be the baseball-playing hero they all need.<br />Chabon manages to create a book with a warm edge, despite the poignant spots and grim storyline. Very, very weird material such as the ferishers, the giants, werefoxes, baseball saving the world, and the giant prophetic oyster is somehow made quite normal and believable. But tossing fantasy elements at the readers isn't why the book is appealing; rather, it is Chabon's ability to make us laugh, cry or shiver. Between the more comical moments are things such as a ferisher mourning her beloved baby brother, who became a faceless rag doll, or the introduction of the hideous, head-pitching graylings (which, as disfigured ferishers, show anunderstanding of what made J.R.R. Tolkien's Ringwraiths so hideous -- ordinary creatures transformed into something intensely evil and hideous).<br />Ethan is the oddball kid, the quiet one who doesn't want to doggedly pursue something he isn't good at, and can't possibly imagine himself a hero. Jennifer T. is a tough girl, but her own vulnerabilities are shown in her dislike of failure, even if it wasn't the other person's fault. And Coyote rises above most fantasy villains as he is presented as evil, but we get some insights into his hideously twisted thought processes. Some of the characters, such as Taffy the Sasquatch, are a little harder to swallow, but Cinquefoil is a very human, very likeable guy. While this book is fairly wordy, it's a deft wordiness that fans of \\"Hobbit\\" will probably enjoy. Chabon's dialogue is realistic, and his descriptions are detailed but not overly so.<br />Because of Chabon's Pulitzer win, some readers may be expecting an incredibly in-depth classic for the ages. That will only yield disappointment. It's merely a good book, with all the elements of a good book that kids, and most probably adults as well, will enjoy. Not to mention die-hard baseball fans.o something intensely evil and hideous).<br />Ethan is the oddball kid, the quiet one who doesn't want to doggedly pursue something he isn't good at, and can't possibly imagine himself a hero.

How much of sexuality is in culture, and how much is written in our DNA? That question was the basis of a study decades ago, when a normal baby boy was raised as a baby girl, with results entirely opposite what were expected. The story of the outstandingly strong and courageous David Reimer is a fascinating read.<br />Bruce Reimer, one of two identical twins, lost his penis when a surgical circumcision went horribly wrong. His aghast parents eventually went to sex researcher Dr. John Money to see what could be done, and were convinced that they could raise Bruce -- renamed \\"Brenda\\" -- as a transsexual girl. After the beginning surgery, the parents began raising their son as a daughter. But masculinity proved to be more than skin-deep. \\"Brenda\\" proved to be tough, scrappy, disliked traditionally female clothing and tasks.<br />Throughout the years until adolescence, \\"Brenda\\" and Brian also had to deal with Dr. Money's intensely creepy inquisitiveness about sex, gender identity, and the two of them. The world accepted \\"Brenda\\" as an example of gender being entirely a matter of nurturing -- except that \\"Brenda\\" always identified \\"herself\\" as a boy, and upon reaching teen years, \\"her\\" voice began to crack and an attraction to teenage girls formed. The Reimer family was traumatized by the deception and strain, until \\"Brenda\\" was told the truth. He took on the name \\"David,\\" began dressing like a man again, and has since married a compassionate, sweet woman and adopted her children.<br />This is an immensely disturbing book, and not just because of the events that started it off, but because of the cold, callous Dr. Money. Identifying his abusive father as being masculine, and living with a bunch of anti-male aunts and mom, he clearly had strong disdain for other men (one striking comment is his statement that women would be better off if all men were castrated), and a lot of radical sexual views that he used as bullets against experts who disagreed with him. One incredibly disturbing anecdote is when he forced the very young siblings Brian and \\"Brenda\\" to simulate sex, as well as showing them a lot of pornography and asking extremely graphic, personal questions that two young children should not have been asked. David's parents, despite their dogged willingness to go along with Money, are not portrayed as uncaring or stupid -- rather they were desperate to give their son some kind of happiness.<br />Despite being told almost entirely in quotes and articles, as well as many exclusive interviews with David and his family members, this book manages to really capture the reader's attention and not let go. While keeping an impartial distance from the drama, this book nevertheless draws the reader into the real-life events; it also gives a lot of information about hermaphrodites and what causes the condition. The pictures add a great deal: Some show how identical the twin boys were, despite the long hair and dresses that \\"Brenda\\" had. Others show David as he shifted back into the role he was born to, and ends with a beautiful picture of himself and his wife after their wedding.<br />This book never becomes sordid or sensationalistic, but tells it how it is.

Around the time Bair is born, another boy of destiny is born in the Eastern land of Jung -- a child cut from a dead woman, who has a massive dragon-shaped birthmark on his head and neck.<br />With the help of an evil yellow-eyed demonlike mage called Ydral, the child becomes a mighty Emperor. He also gains control of the Dragonstone, and so is able to command any dragons anywhere. Bair, meanwhile, is raised and tutored by Dwarves, Elves, and the elf mariner Aravan. Fulfilling a promise, he accompanies Aravan on a journey that takes them across Mithgar toward Jung -- and then to the other worlds of Neddra (evil things), Adonar (elves), and Vadaria (Mages). And they learn that the final battle between good and evil is beginning.<br />One of the frustrating things about this book is that it does have a lot of promise. But unfortunately it is too wrapped up in the prior books (for instance, will newbies to Mithgar know who the heck Danner Bramblethorn is?) and too desperate to tie up the loose ends to really utilize its plot. The first part of the book is word-for-word recap from \\"Eye of the Hunter,\\" and the first third of the book is essentially buildup to a plateau. And as it struggles to bring it all to a climax, it drops quite a few of the threads it was supposed to deal with.<br />Bair is a typical perky perfect-kid hero with special powers that nobody talks to him about. One of the worst things about him is that he's underutilized: His power to go from one plane to another really doesn't accomplish anything, plotwise. In fact, Bair never really accomplishes much at all. Aravan tells Bair not to be an idiot, engages in philosophical banter, and mopes because he thinks his girlfriend is dead. The bad guys are casually ambitious and amoral -- while this might be fine for Ydral, but his self-important pre-history Chinese emperor is a conscienceless idiot with a very big mouth. The kid has no redeeming characteristics at all, and so it's hard to really see him as a person.<br />Descriptions are flatter than ever, since McKiernan takes readers for the first time to Neddra, Adonar and Vadaria -- all of which are indiscernable from parts of our own world. Why bother? On the other hand, he's becoming more enamored of blood, bile, gore, and especially intestines (I don't know why he keeps mentioning intestines) and any scene with a bit of grossness or violence can be counted on to have some spilled guts. There are, however, some genuinely chilling (and disgusting) scenes, like when Ydral does his necromancer thing on a flayed man; there are also some funny scenes, though sadly too few.<br />And fans of this series will probably like seeing characters from prior books like Loric, Alamar, Phais and Dalavar Wolfmage, and discussions of others like Tip, Beau, Thork, Elyn and Danner. The dialogue has gradually gotten better, but there are still some really dopey moments, such as the most hackneyed love proclaimation ever (\\"My heart was dead, but now it lives\\"?) and the laughable idea of the mightiest dragon crying like a baby. That, and the dialogue of the Warrows is now almost indistinguishable from that of the Elves.<br />\\"Silver Wolf, Black Falcon\\" rises a bit higher than most of McKiernan's books, but it is still too self-important and too unimaginative to be even good light fun.im is that he's underutilized: His power to go from one plane to another really doesn't accomplish anything, plotwise.

This book could have been a sordid tangle of tabloid sensationalism, but Alexander Walker carefully crafts it into a tapestry.<br />Vivien Leigh was one of the most memorable actresses of the twentieth century, playing the headstrong Scarlett O'Hara. Yet Vivien was not as strong or indomitable as she appeared onscreen. The book starts with a poetic interlude during a peaceful time in her life, with several guests attending a dinner, then shifts back to her girlhood. Her first marriage fell as her fame rose, and she soon met the man she would fall in love with, her also-married costar Lawrence Olivier. But Vivien's life, despite her fame and idyllic life, was never a happy woman, her mental problems plaguing her to the end of her life.<br />Very few authors are able to strike a balance between admiration and reality; they'll either idolize the object of their biography, or pour vitriol on them. Walker does neither. While he acknowledges Vivien's faults, he also seems to care about her and her struggles. Nothing could more poignantly convey Vivien's pain than when she shrieked at a nurse, \\"I'm not Scarlett, I'm Blanche!\\" (Blanche being a character she played who went mad).<br />Vivien herself is a vivid presence from the first pages onward. Her struggles with mental illness are done with great delicacy, as is her relationship with Olivier. He himself is almost as strong a presence, even though he ultimately could not stay with her; another impressive real-life presence is Jack Merivale, the understanding younger man who remained with her until her untimely death. The scene where Merivale brings Olivier to his dead ex-wife's beside is another extremely effective anecdote.<br />The writing style is lush for a biography. Quite uniquely, there is also a lot of focus on Vivien's movies as well as her personal life, especially her dogged pursuit of roles that she desperately wanted to play. The pictures are well-suited for this book -- they're clear, elegant, well-laid out, relevant to the different parts of Vivien's life, and balanced well between her on-screen roles and her personal life. Walker keeps these pictures of her roles grounded by mentioning what was going on in Vivien's life while she filmed the movie.<br />Alexander Walker's biography of Vivien Leigh is a treasure for all of her fans. Without being sordid ior adoring, he creates a believable biography about a troubled, talented and passionate actress. Outstanding read.ursuit of roles that she desperately wanted to play.

Dickens, right? Wrong: Edward Gorey does his own take on &quot;Christmas Carol&quot; in &quot;The Haunted Tea Cosy.&quot; Delightfully verbose and filled with Gorey's surreal drawings, this is a picture book that adults will adore.<br />Recluse Edward Gravel is going about dreary tasks before Christmas. Then sudden an enormous insectile creature leaps from beneath the tea cosy. (Never mind what a tea cosy is) It is the Bahhum Bug, which has come to &quot;diffuse the interests of didacticism.&quot; To escort the Bahhum Bug and Mr. Gravel, three subfuse but transparent personages appear to show him the Christmas That Never Was, The Christmas That Isn't, and The Christmas That Never Will Be. They show him distressing scenes around the grey town of Lower Spigot. It's written in a wry, twisted style, this book includes delightfully dour illustrations by the late and much lamented Gorey.<br />Tired of relentless holiday cheer?

Rose Sabin's \\"School For Sorcery\\" is nothing to write home about. With moderately endearing characters and a somewhat underexploited storyline, it fails to live up to its potential. It's not a bad book, it's just not a particularly good book.<br />Tria Tesserell has always had magical gifts, but living in a small village with a strict father and cowed mother has never given her room to exercise those gifts. So she is thrilled to go to the Lesley Simonton School for the Magically Gifted. Until she arrives, that is -- there are few students, grimy buildings, tiny rooms and stern teachers. Tria breaks an important rule (folding time) within a few hours of arriving, and her roommate is Lina, a charmingly nasty panther-girl who proceeds to make life difficult -- and not just for Tria.<br />But the two girls have to put their differences aside on the night of a formal dance. There, a pair of male students, Oryon and Kress, bring in beautiful masked women -- who reveal themselves to be demonic Dire Women. The Dire Women snatch up a pair of young boys and escape the school. The Headmistress is unable to stop Oryon or bring back the boys -- and it falls to Tria and her pals to bring them back.<br />\\"School For Sorcery\\" has an adequate plot, adequate writing, adequate characters, and adequate dialogue. The key word there is \\"adequate.\\" has a lot of the standard boarding-school characters and problems. As a result, it ends up retreading a lot of the same territory as the Harry Potter and \\"College of Magics\\" books. The universe that Sabin writes is also rather undefined. Is this fictional world an alternate universe or a separate fantasy world? It's never entirely clear.<br />The writing is fairly standard, ranging from extremely descriptive to painfully stark, and it lacks the lushness of Emily Drake's writing, or the entertaining zip of Diana Wynne-Jones'. There seems to be a bit of an anti-male streak, as virtually all the men are ineffectual, bigoted or evil. The dialogue is a bit of a problem; it's often more than a little stilted (hasn't anyone in this book ever heard of contractions?) and this becomes especially distracting during dramatic moments. And some readers may not be keen on the heroines summoning a demonic Dire Woman in a rather sinister ritual that involves animal sacrifice and a pentagram.<br />Tria herself is a fairly ordinary heroine. There is nothing to really set her apart or make her special, except for her rather vaguely-defined powers. Nubba will gain more sympathy from readers, between  her hysterical fits and teasing from her classmates. Other girls such as Kathyn and Taner don't reaklly display any individual characteristics aside from \\"angry sister\\" and \\"tough warrior-woman\\"; they don't detract from the plot, but they don't add to it either. Oryon at first seems like a promising villain, but he quickly descends into blatant mustache-twirling.<br />If you're an older Harry Potter fan waiting for the next book, you won't find what you crave in this rather lackluster first novel.

But \\"Dream On: Livin' On the Edge With Steven Tyler and Aerosmith\\" might leave you wanting to do just that for Cyrinda Foxe-Tyler, the late ex-wife of Steven Tyler and (by her own admission) a huge pain in the backside. Foxe-Tyler's autobiography is a slow embittered grind that seems less like a recounting of her own life than an endless stream of seedy recountings about just what a jerk her ex is.<br /><br />Born to a moody abusive mother with a penchant for marrying various moody abusive men, Cyrinda (then Kathleen Victoria Hetzekian -- although she refuses to reveal the last, because \\"I want to leave my father out of this\\") was a miserable military brat lugged around the globe.<br /><br />Her refuges: rock'n'roll (Elvis, the Beatles, the Stones), light drug use, and sexual experimentation with the boys on base... and pretty soon, her life was all about those three things. Before long, she had left Oklahoma and Texas behind for the bright lights of the big city, namely New York -- courtesy of Lou Reed and a pair of Danish black boots. And despite being \\"the most naive, cotton-candy-headed being in the world,\\" Cyrinda quickly established herself in Max's Kansas City, NYC's gay underworld, and Andy Warhol.<br /><br />And then after a brief first marriage (her first husband is a faceless footnote), she met, got pregnant by and married Steven Tyler, the volatile and popular singer for the band Aerosmith. But of course passion doesn't last forever, and despite having a beautiful daughter between them, their acrimonious marriage was doomed from the start.<br /><br />There are two kinds of rock wives/paramours: the classy and genuinely intelligent ones like Marianne Faithfull and Bebe Buell, and then there are the Angela Bowie ones who want to shovel dirt on their exes. Cyrinda is solidly in the latter grouping -- \\"Dream On: Livin' On the Edge With Steven Tyler and Aerosmith\\" seems to exist solely to smack her ex-husband in the head as frequently as possible, and often as tastelessly as possible (the \\"dive for it\\" anecdote is revolting).<br /><br />When she isn't heaping dirt on Tyler's head, Cyrinda devotes most of the book to ranting randomly about various topics -- she raves about gays, her hatred of religion, her aversion to getting a job (to the point of sleeping with people for room and board) and how she is cooler and more in tune with young people and sex than her contemporaries. She also seems a bit fixated on her own sexual exploits, ranging  from unofficial prostitution to a threesome with David and Angela Bowie to voyeuristic peeking at others having sex.<br /><br />And her embitterment spreads to everything in this book, including other members of Steven Tyler's family --she gets in some digs at his ex-lover Buell and daughter Liv, barely acknowledges his second wife Teresa, and utterly ignores his third and fourth kids.<br /><br />And it's undeniable that Tyler was a drug-addled mess for countless years... and that's just what his friends say. But despite her seedy anecdotes about Tyler, the person who is most degraded in \\"Dream On\\" is Cyrinda herself -- she comes across as lazy (how dare her ex not hire a full-time nanny for someone who refuses to get a job!), hypocritical (she demonizes Tyler for abuse, while proudly talking about the gouges she left in his face -- by her own admission not the only ones) and generally deluded about how others see her (\\"You're too intellectual!\\"). Not to mention deluded about her own place in life (seeing herself as an \\"aristocrat\\" compared to Aerosmith).<br /><br />\\"Dream On: Livin' On the Edge With Steven Tyler and Aerosmith\\" is a sad memoir of a sad woman, whose bitterness wasn't exorcised until the very end of her life.

Kerr's \\"Fell\\" trilogy is now compiled in one book, covering all three: \\"Fell,\\" \\"Fell Back,\\" and \\"Fell Down.\\" While it's now commonplace to put old trilogies in one book, it doesn't really work out in this case. Though Kerr's vaguely fantastical prose and tense plotting are a delight to read, the story falls short in the last third, where everything seems to come unraveled.<br />In \\"Fell,\\" John Fell is an ordinary guy in a semi-ordinary town, with a shopaholic mother and a wealthy WASP girlfriend whose father is doing everything he can to break them up. His life takes an unexpected turn when a man he knows offers to send him to a wealthy prep school, pretending to be his own son. Needless to say, Fell jumps at the chance. At first he adjusts well into the rhythms of his new school, even being inducted into the elite Sevens group. But then he discovers that his benefactor's motives aren't all benevolent, and there may be murder in the air.<br />\\"Fell Back\\" takes place directly after \\"Fell,\\" in the aftermath of a seeming suicide. But Fell doesn't believe the boy's death was suicide -- he heard a scream. As he delves deeper into the mystery, he's also enlisted to divert a local townie girl from the man she is besotted with -- and this involvement leads him to a clash with the FBI.<br />\\"Fell Down\\" follows the finale of \\"Fell Back,\\" when one of Fell's friends dies in a suspicious car crash. Fell is, unsurprisingly, determined to find out the truth, but he's seriously contemplating leaving the school forever. After encountering his ex-girlfriend Keats, Fell begins to delve into a twenty-year-old mystery -- the mystery of the driver in the crash, Lenny Last, who was once a member of Sevens himself. Lenny's best friend mysteriously vanished many years before, and it seems to be linked to a malevolent ventriloquist's dummy...<br />In the first two thirds of the book, Kerr proves herself to be an outstanding writer. The pace is quick, the prose is simple but evocative, and the characterizations are excellent. Unfortunately, the last third doesn't quite match up to the beginning. Kerr seems to drop many of the threads she had wound together in \\"Fell\\" and \\"Fell Back,\\" in favor of a story that seems more than a little surreal compared to the stark realism of the first two. Too much focus is on Lenny and Nelson, and not enough on Fell and his friends, enemies and schoolmates; additionally, the idea of an evil inanimate dummy is somehow hard to swallow. It will also be rather disappointing to readers who want a slam-bang conclusion to the Fell<br />storyline.<br />Fell is an endearing everyman, an ordinary cop's son who has few misconceptions or genuine flaws. He may be a little naive, but he remains steady and reliable throughout the book. Some characters, like his mother, his teachers, and some of his classmates remain as insubstantial as ghosts. Others are as vibrant -- or even more so -- than real people.<br />And Kerr does not pretend that anyone is uncomplicated. Almost every person in this book has their hidden thoughts, motives, and actions; an example would be the older girl that Fell dated, and who was secretly having an affair with his benefactor. The writing style has a slightly fantastical edge to it. While the plot is more of a murder mystery, there is a slight feel of unreality to the proceedings, as if anything could happen. The frequent changeovers -- where a seedy lowlife can be revealed as an FBI agent -- make this feeling even more prominent. And she manages to mingle romance, action, mystery, murder, surreal edges and a dash of the teen angst vibe.<br />Though the last third is deeply flawed and not entirely satisfying, overall the Fell trilogy is an intriguing, slightly surreal read.

Now read a unique, wistful book -- half autobiography, half fictional short stories -- that goes back to David Almond's childhood in a small English mining town.<br />Almond goes back to Stoneygates and looks at things through the eyes of a child -- the world is a magical, mystical place, where sadness and joy lurk around every corner. He writes of a lonely old woman who keeps her dead baby in a jar, and what happens to the lost baby after her death. He writes of a tender first love with a girl at the church. He writes of a retarded woman who claims to have been visited by the Virgin Mary, of the deaths of his parents and sister, a homeless man whose voice was stolen by a fanatical headmistress, of a crisis of faith, of a tormenting bully, of a trip into a fairground \\"Time Machine,\\" a kindly but strict priest who claims that to count more than a hundred stars is blasphemy, and of angels who show him what he most longs to see.<br />It's impossible to tell how much of this is true, and how much is imagined. But the elements woven into the story are disarmingly real. Death, life, God, faith, suffering and love are presented in a uniquely surreal manner. His descriptions are starkly evocative; he may describe an angel merely as looking like a woman, but more perfect, and the reader will understand perfectly well what he is saying. Even though it's clear he often does not agree with some of the people in this (the strict priest, for example) Almond never treats them with scorn or mockery unless they are genuinely cruel.<br />It's a beautiful glimpse of what went into the creation of such modern classics as \\"Skellig,\\" \\"Kit's Wilderness\\" and \\"Heaven Eyes.\\" A treasure.	2002-10-31

So Warren G. Harris's \\"Sophia Loren\\" is an interesting read, if a somewhat plain vanilla one. Good photos, some amusing anecdotes and a basic summary of Sophia's life are what readers will find.<br />It traces her life from a scrawny illegitimate baby (whom a wet nurse described as looking like a rat, and who was later nicknamed \\"Toothpick\\"), whose mother was abandoned by her father, leaving her alone with two children. But Sophia Scicolone (later Sophia Lazzaro, and then Sophia Loren) rapidly bloomed into a beautiful woman, becoming a beauty contest champ and then an actress. Despite a string of flops and a controversial relationship with a divorced man, Sophia became one of the most beautiful and women in the world, and the first Oscar winner of a performance in a foreign-language film.<br />The best description of this book is \\"adequate.\\" It's not amazingly written, researched or presented. Rather it presents the basics of Sophia's life up the 1990s, which seems to have been a fairly straightforward, open one. There isn't really much that is new in this, but what is there is usually presented in an entertaining manner. Between the \\"battle of the bosoms\\" and Frank Sinatra teaching Sophia some obscene questions in English, we hear some funny events as well as a few bittersweet ones. And unlike many biographies, this one gives detailed summaries of her various movies.<br />Sophia herself is presented as a warm and sweet person, who cabled flowers to Clark Gable's widow and befriended nearly every costar (entrancing a few as well). The pictures are not well-chosen, as there aren't as many as there could have been, and quite a few seem to focus on Sophia in various stages of undress (ranging from her see-through prostitute gown to her merry widow to her topless dance number in \\"It's Him -- Yes Yes!\\"). Carlos Ponti, her husband, is a nebulous figure -- we don't learn much about him. Sophia's family and friends are better defined, such as her never-say-die mother Romilda, her commitmentphobe father, and the extremely emotional Cary Grant.<br />It's not outstanding, but it's a big plus for fans of the amazing Sophia Loren.

But they are attacked by Mack the Knife, \\"the most evil villain in London,\\" who kidnaps Ned. Lily and Rose are rescued by a mysterious figure who resembles the devil. But it's not a devil, it's Spring-Heeled Jack, who perkily informs them, \\"I'm good. I catch villains. I avenge wrongs. I do all kinds of stuff.\\" (But does he slice, dice, and freshen your breath while you sleep?)<br />Jack takes Lily and Rose to his friend Polly, unaware that the sinister boss and amoral old maid from the orphanage are after the three children, intending to steal the locket as well. Will Spring-Heeled Jack rescue the incredibly outspoken Ned from a gang of thugs? Will he rescue the girls from Mr. Killjoy and Miss Gimlet?<br />One of the problems with \\"Spring-Heeled Jack\\" is the narrative. It's split between comic-strip-style cartoons and regular text -- and unfortunately neither the text or the cartoons can stand alone in telling the story. This jarring transition might be exciting for very young children, especially if a parent is reading the story out loud, but older kids will probably find it jarring. And unfortunately while corny dialogue can be stomached in the cartoon format, the regular narrative just makes it sound trite.<br />This cutesy arrangement also harms the characters, as every one of them is essentially a stereotype except Spring-Heeled Jack himself. There are the kindly young lovers, the evil orphanage owners, the unusually patient murdering robbers, the loyal pooch and the plucky preteens. With the exception of a very witty cartoon kitchen cat, Jack himself is the only interesting character in the bunch. He's also the most underexposed, since he is present perhaps a fourth of the time that the bland Polly is.<br />Fans of Philip Pullman's charming \\"I Was A Rat!\\" and \\"Firework-Maker's Daughter\\" will be disappointed in this calculatedly cutesy tale.

You wouldn't think so, reading \\"Detectives in Togas.\\" Seven high-spirited Roman boys and their crabby teacher make up the cast of this outstanding head-scratcher, set in the heydey of Rome's domination.<br />Rufus disrupted Xantippus's class by writing \\"Caius is a dumbbell\\" on a tablet, provoking Caius to start yelling. In the blink of an eye, Rufus has been thrown out of the schoolmates, alarming his classmates. What's even more alarming is that the same message is scrawled on a sacred temple's wall the next day -- in Rufus's handwriting. This act of sacrilege will destroy Rufus's life, and for some reason he won't deny it.<br />The day of the defacing, Xantippus's house is robbed and the wax tablet is taken, but the robber leaves behind a beautiful golden brooch. The boys go to the soothsayer Lukos, but that goes horribly wrong when the soothsayer chases them out, and they leave behind Mucius, who then proceeds to fall into the Baths of Diana -- discovering that Rufus spent the night there before. The boys soon become enmeshed in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse centering on politics, money and revenge.<br />Henry Winterfield clearly had solid memories of being a teenage boys. His gaggle of young boys are entirely realistic -- they bicker, they make idiots of themselves, they make all the wrong decisions, they all have distinct personalities. With a cast including seven young boys from similar backgrounds, you would think that they would all be the same, but Winterfield manages to make each one unique. Xantippus is the crabby grandfather with a marshmallowy interior. He clearly cares about all the boys, but is impatient about their blunders.<br />Kids may leave this charming mystery with a wish to learn a little more about Rome (and to read the sequel, of course). And don't be surprised if you hear someone shouting, \\"Mike asinus est!\\"	2002-10-25

Cleaned up and devoid of ... violence or much profanity, he makes a cute, quirky book that isn't limited to just kids. If anything, Mr. Hiaasen's literary gifts are more pronounced when there are no seedy elements to distract the readers.<br />Roy Eberhardt recently moved from beautiful Montana to the swampy mishmash of Miami, and he's not thrilled about the change. He misses his old home, and the biggest, meanest bully of all, Dana Matherson, has taken a dislike to him. But on the bus, Roy catches a glimpse of a barefoot kid racing down the sidewalk. When he sees the boy a second time, he punches out Dana and pursues the kid (called Mullet Fingers, for a reason that will become evident late in the book).<br />A mystery vandal is sabotaging the site of a future pancake restaurant, pulling up stakes, sprat-painting a cop car, and setting loose a bunch of glittery cottonmouths. Things don't improve when Roy encounters the boy's sister, Beatrice, a very tall jock with muscles and teeth of steel. Beatrice warns Roy to stay away from Mullet Fingers, but Roy is already quite involved. Mullet Fingers is on a one-boy campaign to save the tiny burrowing owls that live in the construction site -- and will be buried alive in their burrows when the construction begins. Roy begins walking the line between law and outlaw, right and wrong, trying to save Mullet Fingers and the tiny owls.<br />Roy is the kind of kid that readers love instantly -- he's a quiet Charlie Brown who comes out of his shell for a good cause. (And he moons Dana) Mullet Fingers is a little harder to pin down, a strangely  but that seems to be Hiaasen's intent. Beatrice is half-hilarious, half menacing -- the scene where she bites off part of Roy's bike tire is a scream. Dana is a pain in the backside, and readers will laugh and rejoice at his comeuppance. And Hiaasen outdoes himself with Roy's parents. He doesn't make them stupid, condescending or obtuse, but rather they trust in the big corporations a bit too much. And one of the most touching elements of this book is that Roy asks his parents for their advice, and protects his kindly mother from the knowledge of how Mullet Fingers' own mother despises him.<br />Unlike many other adult authors who write a book for kids, Hiaasen doesn't dumb it down. He seems to have faith that his kiddie readers can handle tales of corporate double-dealing, enviromental mandayes, and paperwork that most people never have to think about. Kooky elements like a B-movie actress, an ambitious if well-meaning cop (the one whose car was painted), a baby alligator in a porta-john and a bunch of sparkling cottonmouths with taped mouths add an element of surreality to the book.<br />\\"Hoot\\" is a hoot, but it's also a charmingly serious novel.

With mediocre settings, stereotyped characters, and a ridiculous heroine, this is barely worth the paper it's written on. Only good supporting character manages to save this novella from the trash heap.<br />The unnamed Dragonslayer has a new apprentice: a cocky girl called merely Jackie, the first female dragonslayer apprentice ever. Together the two of them travel through the land, dealing with dragons and vicious birds, self-proclaimed witches and idiot villagers. But the Dragonslayer has some suspicions about the background of his capable new apprentice.<br /><br />There's not much plot in \\"Apprentice,\\" as the characters just amble from one undistinguished town to the next on their little jobs, all of which are done with no blood, injury, death or real effort. A more complex or well-defined plot might have saved the book from the mediocre characterizations or generic medieval world. But the world is a generic one: There's no way to tell where this is,k or whether it's 1000, 1900, or any time period in between. There's a spattering of little kingdoms with little kings, and a lot of idiot villagers straight out of a Monty Python sketch. The dragons seem about as dangerous as garbage trucks.<br /><br />The book's most glaring flaw is Jackie. She's essentially a rich kid with a big mouth, who ran away to be a dragonslayer because she didn't like the cliched superficial people in the king's court. A comparable situation would be a socialite running away to be a sewage worker, and so Jackie's reasons are ludicrous at best. Jackie's lack of basic manners, civility, and her know-it-all attitude won't endear her to readers in a hurry. The Dragonslayer is the saving grace of the book, smart in a quiet way, with some moments of genuine wit. If only Calder had given the poor guy a name.<br /><br />The writing style is the worst example of \\"telling not showing\\" that I have ever read. Calder frequently informs readers of what the various characters are saying or discussing, but he never bothers to include those little chit-chats in the form of dialogue. The landscapes, villages and people are rarely, if ever, described with any real detail.<br /><br />\\"Dragonslayer's Apprentice\\" is a good read for someone recovering from major surgery, and perhaps taking large doses of painkillers.

This is a real-as-life story about true love and courage, with a dash of crime and religion in there to balance it all out.<br />High-school students Blanche and Rose once lived in luxury in the country, but since the death of their father they live in a slushy city with their overworked mother. At their new school, they are generally ignored or abused, especially Blanche, who frequently has dizzy spells.<br />The girls are, at first, less than thrilled when their mother brings a homeless young man called \\"Bear\\" home. Despite their apprehension, soon they become close friends with him, based on a mutual love of poetry and jokes. But after a disastrous prom night where Bear is thrown out of the dance and Rose is  intimidated by a would-be seducer, the girls find themselves in a potentially deadly struggle with a ruthless man -- with a grudge against Bear and the mysterious boy called \\"Fish.\\"<br />Regina Doman manages to triumph in this book is several areas. Though there are essential religious themes woven into the plotline, there is no irritating sanctimonious air to the book. The two heroines aren't goody-goodies loved for their virtues, but mocked for them. And it's not exactly squeaky-clean either: there are themes such as child abandonment, homelessness, assault and attempted murder, heart trouble, and Rose's boyfriend pressuring her for sex. However, Doman is never less than tasteful, and her handling of these is in sync with the vein of Roman Catholic beliefs that runs through the novel.<br />Blanche and Rose are another good accomplishment. Rather than being carbon copies of one another, as siblings in many books are, the two girls have strengths and weaknesses that complement each other. Bear is a gentle giant who loves poetry and swing dancing; he proves to be a character like an onion, that is gradually unpeeled. And Fish is my personal favorite, a cocky wise-cracker who doesn't let any situation (including attempted murder) keep him down for too long.<br />One of the few \\"real life\\" fairy tale retellings that works. \\"Shadow of the Bear\\" is an enchanting love story with a pulse-pounding storyline and likeable characters.peeled.

If this is literature, then \\"Friends\\" is a documentary. And that is just the way it should be.<br />Greg Nagan rewrites a bunch of the most famous novels ever written. After a fragmented and historically dubious description  of the origins of Western lit (bet you never knew \\"Gilgamesh\\" and the Bible were dueling for the bestseller list), he begins at the beginning. First comes a rather mangled version of the Iliad, which is written with a great deal of goofy gore. Then the Divine Comedy (well, part of it anyway), which has been rewritten in limerick form. Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" is the next victim, where (after eating the apple) Adam says to Eve, \\"Come to Daddy, baby!\\" Jane Austen's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is also fair game, in an ultra-repressed England where passionate young women with dewy heaving bosoms fall for rotters. (And Elinor does something unspeakably funny with a knitting needle)  Then it's to the pit of England's misery in Charles Dickens' \\"Christmas Carol,\\" where Scrooge is escorted by the spirits to another Dickins novel. Melville's \\"Moby-Dick\\" has a loony captain and a bunch of rather clueless sailors in search of a big white whale. Dostoyevsky's \\"Crime and Punishment\\" features a squalid Russian killing other squalid Russians in a very squalid, depressing Russia.<br />Oscar Wilde's \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has two repressed (yeah right!) English guys trying to either corrupt or save Dorian Gray, a beautiful lad who becomes psychotically self-serving. (\\"Cool.\\") Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" is another example of repressed English people and wimpy women who sleepwalk -- oh yeah, and a foreign doctor with a weird acent, and a vampire. Kafka's \\"Metamorphosis\\" is hilariously nihilistic, with a family who becomes nasty and intolerant just because a man has become a bug. James Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" has been painstaking condensed down to one sentence. Orwell's \\"1984\\" has a guy rebelling against Big Brother (and no, it isn't a family drama) by reading a dense book and sleeping with a girl. Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" essentially has Holden stomping around, contemplating how much he hates the universe. (The description also applies to the original work) Hemingway's \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" parodies, in particular, the rambling conversations (\\"Yes, they are different.\\" \\"Different.\\" \\"Yes.\\"  \\"But not bad.\\" \\"No.\\" \\"No, not the same.\\" \\"Yes.\\") The book rounds off with \\"On the Road\\" by Jack Kerouac, which goes from beginning to end in one long rambly sentence.<br />Perhaps the funniest thing about this is not just that Nagan spoofs the novels, but the authors behind them. Wilde's story contains one of the funniest examples of this, spoofing the gay undertones of his book (\\"Of course I'm not! I'm an impeccably repressed Victorian gentleman!\\"), followed by the dreary Russian misery of Dosteyevsky and the don't-remove-your-gloves-lest-a-man-see-your-delicate-wrists repression of Austen's time. (Yet jamming a knitting needle through someone's skull is socially acceptable... strange times Austen lived in!)<br />It helps to have at least a basic knowledge of each classic's storyline, but you don't need to have read them to appreciate the gutsplitting humor of each one. If you're a fan of Dave Barry, or if you hate pompous classics, this is the book for you.

On the other hand, his villain is a little too cartoonish, and his story a little too cutesy and cliched.<br />The hideous, evil witch Dragwena has been pulling children with magical ability to the icy world of Ithrea for a long, long time. The kids always turn out not to be talented enough for Dragwena's purposes, and she allows them to live as aged, abused servants. But when she magically pulls the two children Eric and Rachel to Ithrea, she finds that Rachel possesses powers comparable to her own.<br />Rachel and Eric are treated well initially by the strange woman with a serpent for a necklace. They befriend her servant Morpeth, who helps Rachel develop her powers in the desperate hope that she can help his enslaved friends. But Dragwena is still stronger than Rachel is -- and determined to transform the girl into a bloodthirsty witch as well.<br />McNish definitely has a flair for fantasy. While not the best fantasy that I've read, it contained a number of surprises and intriguing elements to keep me guessing up until the climax. Unfortunately the plot is also saddled with a lot of rather cutesy cliches. The magically empowered preteen, the rhyming prophecy, Ithrea and its bizarre wildlife, and the idea of children being turned into broken slaves of the witch were all irritatingly cliched. And every now and then, McNish trots out something so ridiculous that it simply does not belong, such as the bickering bird-baby \\"prapsies.\\" And often Dragwena becomes too gleefully evil to be convincing.<br />However, he does have a talent for descriptive writing. His descriptions of Rachel's transformations are outstanding, as is the world of Ithrea. His characterizations, aside from Dragwena, are fairly good. While Rachel is hampered by the clear influence from the author's daughter, she is a fairly convincing heroine. More outstanding are Eric, the quiet background guy who serves an unexpected (though too convenient) purpose in the plot, and Morpeth, who manages to be both old and young, mature and insecurely boyish.<br />Overall this is a cute little fantasy book. Not for those who like their stories hard-core, but good for the kids who are searching for something new and yet familiar.uence from the author's daughter, she is a fairly convincing heroine.

Now she takes their story a few steps further, in a hotel stay and house repair difficulty bad enough to induce cold sweats in the middle of the night. It's a charming sequel with the same quirky cast and unabashed low humor, and kids will love it.<br />The roof of StregaSchloss is not just leaking, but falling off. After a slate demolishes the family car and a deluge of water destroys the library, Signor Strega-Borgia moves the family out to a hotel until the problem can be rectified. Unfortunately, the family not only includes his wife, his kids Titus Pandora and Damp, and the family nurse, but also the pet dragon, griffin, yeti and crocodile. (The cryogenically frozen grandmother, the spider, and the rats all stay behind)<br />Mayhem begins immediately. A desperate real estate dealer begins trying to persuade Signor Strega-Borgia to sell the castle to him (so he can \\"develop\\" the area), and the predatory owner of the hotel, Mrs. Froves-Campbell, tries to seduce him. The pets cause assorted problems. The roof of StregaSchloss vanishes, prompting the horrified Signor Strega-Borgia to sell. And Titus cooks up a scheme to clone himself and Pandroa -- except instead of two full-sized clones, he accidently creates hundreds of tiny ones. With an army of unruly clones, a decaying castle, a pregnant dragon, a murderous hotel owner, and a tiny jar of vanishing cream, Pandora and Titus definitely have their hands full.<br />Gliori manages to sidestep one of the major flaws of many sequels, which is making the sequel too much like the first. \\"Wicked\\" is quite different from \\"Magic,\\" while retaining the elements that made the first book endearing: a mix of magic and technology, a grandmotherly witch, gross-out hijinks and a pair of in-over-their-head kids.<br />The reactions of Pandora and Titus (\\"Our parents would kill us if they knew\\") to having 500 Mini-Mes running around the hotel are hilarious, and there is a note of poignancy when the clones begin to age. Kindly witch Mrs. McLachlan serves as a note of relative sanity, and the skin-and-fur-loving Mrs. Fforbes-Campbell will inspire disgust in readers from the start. And the pets/security system are given extra dimensions when forced to live in ordinary surroundings (and with the promise of new beastie problems in the next book).<br />Those who enjoyed the darkly quirky Strega-Borgia family in the first book will definitely like the second.

Although it lacks in some areas, it overall gets the feeling of a Bellairs kids' thriller, full of the various ghoulish visions and villains and offbeat humor.<br />Johnny Dixon is quite depressed when his best friend Fergie leaves for a while. In an effort to cheer his friend up, Professor Childermass gets a job for Johnny at the Gudge Museum, where he has just donated several artifacts from the malignant wizard Esdrias Leach. Among them is a lightweight wooden hand -- which grips Johnny's fingers when he touches it. He's frightened, but it seems harmless otherwise -- and the professor begins to have nightmares about it.<br />After Johnny takes the job, things begin to go wrong. A strange man comes to the museum to see the artifacts, and seems to know a great deal about Esdrias Leach and his sorcerous ways. Matthias Mergal continues pursuing the artifacts, until the museum is robbed. Now the only people who can hope to stop Mergal are Johnny, the professor, and his new friend Sarah.<br />In many ways, this fits easily into the Bellairs mold. There is a sinister, talkative villain who lurks around the edges until the climax, weird dreams and visions, hideous magic and weird artifacts that are linked to the main plot. Strickland seems to have a good grasp on the correct pacing, descriptions, and dialogue without ever becoming cheesy or cliched. Sometimes his references to things in the 1950s (such as the \\"Howdy Doody\\" show) are a little too forced, as if he's trying very hard to place it in the correct time frame.<br />Johnny is a little more highly-strung than one would expect, but otherwise is well-characterized. The Professor is delightfully crabby and knowledgeable, as always. The main stumbling block is Sarah, but seems like a pale copy of the rough-edged, athletic Rose Rita. I think Fergie would have suited the plot far better. Mergal is a classic Bellairs-type villain, with insanely dark intentions and a very spooky  manner.<br />Despite its flaws and the rather anemic Sarah, \\"Hand of the Necromancer is a good, spooky read by a talented author.

Mollie Hunter is in prime form here, in the tale of two brave kids who struggle to free their village from a vindictive mermaid.<br />Eric Anderson never believed in the mermaid -- until his ship was crashed on the rocks, and he saw a mermaid seconds before the disaster. After that incident, he stays on the land with his family, but eventually grows restless for the sea. He leaves for a shipping job far away. Three years later, his wife, children, and grandchildren Anna and Jon receive nine gifts -- which the wise woman Howdy tells them is significant. Everything regarding the mermaid and their grandfather, she says, will be connected with the number three.<br />One of the gifts is a conch shell, which the spooked Jon finds will summon the mermaid. After Anna accidently calls the mermaid up, the fishy girl is at first charmed by the sight of a \\"female land creature,\\" then demands Anna's gift, a beautiful jade comb. When Anna refuses to give it to her, the mermaid threatens to drive away the herring -- meaning that the village will starve that winter. A war of wills begins between two ingenious kids and a ruthless mermaid -- not just for the village, but for Eric Anderson as well...<br />This is a stronger book than Hunter's \\"Stranger Came Ashore,\\" partly due to the more mainstream plotline and partly due to the third-person narrative. For the characters, Hunter hits all the nails on the head, as every person's emotions and responses are perfectly-written. Her descriptions of a rural village full of life and work is appealing, as are her atmospheric descriptions of the coastline.<br />Jon and Anna are good heroes for this. Jon is strong-willed and a little befuddled by what is going on around him, while Anna is an innocent little girl with a scheming streak. Senior citizens Jamie and the Howdy add a note of experience and wisdom. The mermaid is also excellently drawn: she's not evil so much as lacking in generosity, mercy, or basic kindness. Like a spoiled brat, she wants what she wants, and will throw a tantrum to get it. And in keeping with her vanity, her only goal is to make her sister mermaids envy her.<br />\\"Mermaid Summer\\" is a charming, sometimes spooky look at the less benevolent mermaids.

White infuses the book with whimsy, poignancy, and a mixture of early 20th-century England and medieval times.<br />Sir Ector's ward Arthur (known as \\"Wart\\") has no idea what he's in for when he accompanies Ector's son Kay out on a hunt. When a bad-tempered hawk escapes and refuses to come out of a tree, Wart ends up staying behind all night in the hopes of recapturing it. But he's interrupted by an odd old man called Merlin and his talking owl Archimedes. Merlin captures the hawk -- and then comes home with Wart. Soon he is firmly established as tutor to the two boys.<br />But they soon discover that nobody is quite like Merlin, and the lessons he has to teach Wart are more than just math and Latin. Merlin transforms Arthur into a fish, an owl, a hawk, and sends him on bizarre journeys with Robin Wood (Wood, not Hood -- a common mistake) and his band of Merry Men, a duel with an evil witch, a gathering of trees, a fumbling King and the Questing Beast, and capture in a sinister giant's castle.<br />T.H. White was a wonderful author, and an even better comic author. His characters are fully fleshed and endearing (even the nasty ones), but at the same time there is a delightful lightness to them. There isn't a speck of realism in the entire book -- chronology is bent and spindled, magic and realism are twisted together, and readers won't care at all. In a sense, \\"Sword\\" seems almost to exist in a parallel universe where animals talk, Robin Hood chit-chats with the once and future king, and carnivorous humanoids roam through Britain.<br />\\"Wart\\" is a good hero -- quiet, unassuming, thoughtful, and occasionally puts his foot in his mouth. His foster brother Kay is also good -- Kay is hot-tempered and a little loud-mouthed, but he is a nice person at heart. Merlin is the perfect crabby gray wizard, eccentric and unashamed to use his magic in a perfectly casual manner, and constantly a little befuddled due to his ability to live backwards in time. He'll endear himself to readers from the first page onward. There are dozens of equally funny characters: The always-questing King Pellinore and his Beast, the worried Sir Ector, the walking mustard-pot, the crabby but kindly owl Archimedes, and many, many more.<br />White's writing goes at a slightly uneven clip: Sometimes it zips along quickly, at other times it crawls. He displays plenty of knowledge about medieval times, and seems a little too eager to reveal it to the readers. But his descriptions and dialogue are delightful, a mix of the modern and the medieval. There are some extremely frightening scenes, and some (such as the having to put down a fatally-injured dog) that will make you cry.<br />Readers will come out of this book feeling like they have made a number of memorable, kindly friends.

The story of \\"Beast Under The Wizard's Bridge\\" is both exceptionally clever and somewhat awkward in places, as Strickland still was adjusting to the necessity of writing like another author.<br />The old iron bridge over Wilder Creek is being torn down by the county, to make way for a newer, more modern structure. Lewis Barnavelt's uncle Jonathan is nervous about this -- not only is the bridge a familiar landmark, but it was constructed by a wizard to keep a long-dead relative from returning. The dead relative was Jedediah Clabbernong, a man obsessed with his own aging, and determined to become one of the immortal alien Great Old Ones.<br />Now something is creeping from Wilder Creek. Under the sway of the equally determined Mr. and Mrs. Moote, a hideous squidlike humanoid is rising to the surface again -- and it can suck the life from any creature and reduce it to a disintegrating husk. Now as a comet returns -- the comet that claimed Clabbernong a century before -- Lewis, Rose Rita, Jonathan and Mrs. Zimmerman must stop the Mootes before more hideous creatures are unleashed...<br />Brad Strickland sure knows how to send chills down a spine. In excellent imitation of Bellairs' style, he creates some outstandingly horrifying situations. Jonathan Barnavelt's description of the disintegrating woodchuck he encountered (and pounded to death) is only outdone by the encounter that Lewis and Rose Rita have with an incredibly old, hideous horse. What's wrong? While Bellairs was never the most subtle of writers, the twelve-foot-tall tentacled squid-headed Lovecraftian nightmare seems more than a little excessive. However, his usage of preexisting Bellairs material -- the bridge in \\"House With a Clock In Its Walls\\" -- is flawless.<br />Despite this, Strickland shows excellent skill during the fight scenes and the gradual dramatic buildup. Lewis and Rose Rita are well-characterized and excellent counterparts. Jonathan is the good-natured fretter (portrayed as something of an older version of Lewis) and Mrs. Zimmerman is still the kindly, sharp-witted witch, and even the grandmotherly Mrs. Jaeger makes an appearance. The Mootes are also excellent, reminiscent of the couple in \\"Killer Robot.\\"<br />While not outstanding, \\"Beast\\" is an excellent continuation of Bellairs' books.

It is possible to produce books like that that are also funny and even enlightening, but \\"Gossip Girl\\" is essentially a plodding, repetitive attempt at a \\"real\\" teen book.<br />The beautiful Serena has returned from a sojourn in a ritzy private school and some time in France. Pretty bulimic Blair is dismayed by this, as Serena has unconsciously usurped the position that Blair had been occupying. Even worse, Blair's boyfriend Nate once slept with Serena and is still interested in her, but Serena is not really interested in Nate. Dan is besotted with her, and Jenny looks up to her.<br />Rumors begin to fly about Serena -- that she's slutty, that she has enough STDs for several people, that she had a baby in France, that she was thrown out of her boarding school, that she's had several abortions, and just about every other kind of vicious rumor. And presiding over all of this is Gossip Girl, a mysterious omniscient observer who reports online about the tangled lives of her friends and peers.<br />It seems that readers will never tire of the antics of too-rich Manhattanites, especially if they live depraved, empty lives. Like Nick McDonell's \\"Twelve,\\" this book is filled with shallow, obnoxious characters who do drugs, sex, alcohol, and mourn the problems of their privileged lives. The drugs, sex, alcohol, bulimia and angst serve no actual purpose in the plot; they are merely attempts to shock. The problem is that they are handled in such a haphazard manner that they don't shock at all -- they are merely diversions to spice up the lack of plot. Strip them away, and there's pretty much nothing left. And while McDonell managed some poignant moments and character insights, Von Ziegesar never makes any such attempt. We are never given a reason to react to anyone in this book, either to be interested or repelled by them. I, personally, was only bored by them.<br />Those characters are also stereotypes, in a fictional world where the elite rich are all gorgeous. The scheming insecure girl, the mystery beauty, the shy naive girl, the weak handsome guy, the promiscuous guy, and dozens of others are devoid of any originality. They are part of the stereotype that teenagers are intrinsically shallow and can't be bothered with anyone who is not of interest to them.<br />Admittedly, the \\"Gossip Girl\\" website extracts are amusing. There's a certain wit to them, and they are also the only parts of the book that show some genuine originality. I only wish there had been more of them, and fewer repetitive rumors about Serena's past. The writing style lacks detail or any sort of wit or spiciness. And, like, the dialogue is so, you know, like, stupid, right?<br />Perhaps the worst part of the book is the finale, which fails to produce a climax or wrap up any loose threads. The book simply stops. Perhaps this is an effort to get readers to read \\"You Know You Love Me,\\" if they aren't too disgusted by the plodding storyline and grating characters.

In the same vein as his hideous Elizabeth Taylor biography, he now has penned the basic outline of the bedroom life of Warren Beatty, a guy whose teenage years extended well into his fifties. (Or until people stopped taking him seriously -- whichever came first)<br />It traces the career of Barbra Streisand's old schoolmate, an emotionally-needy Don Juan who went to bed with just about any woman he came across, married or single, famous or not. He remained a heartthrob in Hollywood for many years, reappearing with a bang and a flash when critics had declared his career dead. He dated women like Diane Keaton, Madonna, Michelle Phillips, and finally settled on Annette Bening, whom he married.<br />This book is less about Beatty's life than his bedroom life. We get extensive chronicling of, if not every woman he ever slept with, then quite a few of them. Most of these affairs add nothing either to the book or to our understanding of Beatty. And, as he did in \\"The Most Beautiful Woman In The World,\\" Amburn is not satisfied merely to present Beatty's sexcapades: he does so for just about everyone else in the book. Madonna, Lara Flynn Boyle, Roman Polanski, and dozens of other people have their randy bedroom lives outlined in this book, usually with plenty of detail. Why? No reason. It makes for more titillating reading, I suppose. (The description of videotaped sex games by Sharon Polanski, who was stabbed to death while pregnant, and the first-person description of seduction of a thirteen-year-old, crossed the line into insensitive, tasteless, even pornographic)<br />The actual writing style is plodding and repetitive. Like many bad biographers, Amburn feels the need to spread anecdotes about the main personality traits of his subjects throughout the book. He repeats constantly on the predatory attitudes of Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty, or the strained relationship between Beatty and his sister Shirley MacLaine, or Madonna's liking for other women.<br />Perhaps the most unforgivable aspect of this book is the lack of insight into Beatty's mind. There are a few half-hearted attempts to explain why he tries to bed all these women, to the point of threatening to rape one girl and stalking another, but it's skimming the surface. Near the end of the book, he inexplicably decides to grow up and be responsible -- but by that time, the readers may be so disgusted by him that they will no longer care.<br />If you're hunting for a compendium of every tabloid article ever written about Warren Beatty, this is the book for you.

Rather it seems to mix in a little of everything, with a dash of social commentary and a little comedy as well.<br />Fourteen-year-old Lindsay is not pleased to be living in an under-construction house in New York, with her brat brother and distracted father. But her life takes an unexpcted twist when a strange boy appears in her house during a party, claiming that he needs medicine for his baby sister. Talon is a Downsider, from a primitive civilization that lives in New York's sewers, believe that they have always lived there, fear the sun, disdain the \\"Topsiders,\\" and have their own culture and hierarchy that is unaffected by the world above.<br />Lindsay is intrigued by Talon's world, as he is with hers. But when Lindsay ventures down into the world of the Downsiders, Talon's friend Railborn reports that Talon has committed treason. At the same time, the very world of the Downsiders is threatened with destruction when a new aqueduct is dug -- right through their secret underworld. The Downsiders declare war on the Topsiders, and Lindsay seeks out the truth about their mysterious past.<br />This is one of those books that could have been botched so easily. But Neal Shusterman manages to not make the Downsiders cliched or stupid, nor does he make their culture too alien. An old theater with prismatic earring decorations, the vow that all \\"fallers\\" take, the different hairstyles and clothing styles, and the hunter-gatherer lifestyle (no more alligators in NY sewers, now they have herds of light-sensitive cattle).<br />Shusterman reserves his literary skill for when it's needed. New York \\"topside\\" is paid almost no attention, detail-wise. But he takes great care in his crafting of the strange civilization below the streets, and describes everything in it with loving care. Similarly, his idea for the Downsiders becomes a little too evident too early on the book, but is well-done also. Humor is sprinkled throughout the book when needed; one of the funnier moments has Talon commenting on how amusing H.G. Wells' \\"Time Machine\\" is, as it has savages below ground and beautiful creatures above -- unlike his view of the world. The finale screams for a sequel, after a surprisingly pulse-pounding climax.<br />Lindsay has enough wit and brains to almost instantly endear her to readers. Talon is a fully believable young boy who suddenly has everything he was taught challenged -- and not just little things either. His anger and fear and dwindling prejudice are skillfully drawn. I'm not sure what purpose Lindsay's obnoxious brother served; he appears briefly and then vanished. The father is a poignant figure; his life is going down the drain (literally), and his loneliness is the base of his persona. The scene-stealer is Champ, a sharp old homeless man who lives in a luxurious home in a swimming pool. (His cryptic hints seem a little needlessly mysterious, but otherwise the entire plot would be given away before it was ready)<br />\\"Downsiders\\" is a sharp, tense thriller, a clash of cultures in the same city.

The entire book has very little point except: Kennedy men are scum who break the law and treat women like dirt. But those who have ever gotten a dirty little thrill from tabloids will enjoy this easy read.<br />It begins with the calculating patriarch Joseph Kennedy, whose many affairs were a source of inspiration to his sons. In this book are the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy, the Good Friday rape case, Marilyn Monroe's mysterious death, drugs and alcoholism, divorce and adultery, the Mary Jo Kopechne tragedy, and dozens of other tragedies and mishaps.<br />Thankfully Bly doesn't buy into the sentimental goo about a family curse; in this book, it becomes evident that most of the Kennedy tragedies are, if not caused by their own actions, then nothing more than that -- accidents and tragedies. And it becomes quite evident that they did cause a lot of their own problems, such as Chappaquiddick.<br />With a title like \\"Three Generations of Sex, Scandal and Secrets,\\" obviously as many extramarital affairs as possible are going to be gone over again. Joseph Kennedy's affairs start it off, and Bly happily retells JFK's affairs with Monroe, Inga Arvad, Angie Dickinson, Gene Tierney, and Judith Campbell Exner. While Ted Kennedy is usually a side-player in such books, he's roasted without mercy with plenty about his conquests as well -- including one humiliating anecdote where he takes a drunken prostitute to a party, where she wets an antique sofa. The next generation isn't spared as well: While most of them seem relatively okay, David Kennedy's drug addiction and Joe II's car crash and turbulent lifestyle are aired out. The most vivid of the third-generation Kennedy stories is the William Kennedy rape case. And even \\"John-John\\" doesn't get off too easily: His more flamboyant and famous girlfriends, like Madonna and Sharon Stone, are presented as well.<br />The entire book is written in bite-sized semi-chapters, giving the further impression of tabloid journalism. But the writing style is brisk and pleasant, never getting bogged for too long in any one area unless it's really important. There's a good array of photographs, at least half of which are onetime girlfriends of the various Kennedy men. (Look no further for one of the worst Madonna pictures I've ever seen)<br />Usually tabloid books are disguised with dignified covers and titles.

Most are interested less in telling about his life, every aspect of it, than about his love life. But Nigel Hamilton returns some honor and polish, eschewing sensationalism for the sake of actually writing a book about his life.<br />This book recounts JFK's life until his election in Congress, beginning years before his birth with accounts of his grandparents and parents and what drove Joseph Kennedy to obsess on politics. While it includes JFK's assorted premarital affairs, there is also a great deal of complicated and in-depth information on his Navy service, his health, his political life, his family life, and the things that would affect him when he later became president of the United States.<br />Hamilton manages to pull more material -- only a portion of Kennedy's life -- into more pages than most Kennedy biographers could if they tried. He does this by incredibly in-depth investigation into just about everything in Kennedy's life. This approach not only gives much-needed depth to Kennedy himself, but to other people in his life. While his parents are no more sympathetic here than they ever were (meaning that they probably were as they seem), people that he interacted with (and in some cases, slept with) are given new attention. For example, his first serious lover Inga Arvad is explored in greater depth. Here she is not a promiscuous gold-digger or a clingy adulteress, but a woman who is willing to give up her love for his own good. Her Nazi sympathies and marital status are not downplayed, but her emotions and feelings are presented to the readers to make us realize what she was like.<br />And Hamilton's skill as a writer shows in how he is able to include all this detail and all these anecdotes without boring the readers silly. The eight-hundred-plus pages fly by like those of a book half its length, sprinkled with occasional pictures of JFK, his parents, \\"Inga Binga,\\" Lem Billings, and others. These pictures are relatively few and far between, but make up for it in quality rather than quantity.<br />If you read one Kennedy biography, make sure that it's this one.

And \\"Thorn Ogres of Hagwood\\" shows his gifts at their best -- imaginative, spinechilling, and written with lush detail.<br />The werlings are a race of small, peaceful people in the Hagwood, keeping themselves safe by \\"wergling\\" (shapeshifting into animal forms). Gameliel is a clumsy, shy young werling, who is generally disdained by other werlings -- with the exception of the brilliant, kindly Finnen. Finnen shares a common bond with Gameliel -- and a secret that could ruin his life.<br />But a small group of werlings spot a beautiful woman, the Lady Rhiannon of the Hill, and her corps of goblins, thorn ogres, and other hideous creatures. She has lost something vitally important to her, and will do whatever is necessary to get it back, and preserve her own life by doing so. A Smith with a magical knife may help the werlings, but ultimately it falls to Gameliel and the disgraced Finnen to stop the thorn ogres and the Lady.<br />Robin Jarvis's imagination is evident in his creation of the werlings -- he doesn't make them too complex culturally, but he makes them different in subtle ways. The idea of using a sample of animal fur to transform into that animal is an intriguing one, as is the simplicity of the Lady and her hideous creatures. Jarvis gives us explanations about Rhiannon, but thankfully does not make it complete enough that we like her.<br />The werlings make this book a little too lightweight to be a genuine dark fantasy, like Garth Nix's \\"Sabriel,\\" but there is plenty of darkness and ugliness that will send a chill down the spine. Aside from the thorn ogres, there is also the ghastly Frighty Aggie, a werling who got stuck in a half-insectile form and now remains as a warning legend -- until she makes an appearance that will startle readers. And the atmosphere and occasional goriness of this book add to the overall impression of darkness and closing-in evil. The writing style is detailed and insightful, and the dialogue is quite realistic, aside from one or two odd moments.<br />Gameliel is a sweet hero, a timid little guy with more courage than anyone expects and pretty much no ego. Finnen is a little harder to empathize with at first; though readers will like him for his kindness to Gameliel and an aging mouse, they may be slightly worried about his shameful secret. Kernella is a pain in the backside. And the tough Smith with his magical knife will definitely get the attention and liking of the readers.

Master Gibble, on the other hand, is even more loathsome in his jealousy and cowardice than the Lady ever is.<br />Possibly surpassing the Deptford Mice and Wyrd Museum trilogies, \\"Thorn Ogres of Hagwood\\" is a wonderful fantasy read that promises more werling adventures to come.	2002-09-27

Well thought-out, well-characterized, and sprinkled with sharp dialogue and a tight political storyline, this is a book for those who like the sword part of sword-and-sorcery.<br />Stalwart (called Wart) is one of the King's Daggers, one of the young men trained to become the elite Blades when they are older. Unfortunately, he is also shrimpy and sweet-faced, though he is an expert swordsman. When a senior Blade shows up, Wart is not bound through the magical sword-striking ritual, but he is initiated into the Blades through only his word, so he can be sent on a secret mission. Elsewhere, the White Sister Emerald sees a giant spider, and is expelled from the order when she refuses to deny the spider's appearance.<br />She ends up travelling to another city with the disguised Wart as her driver, but senses that he is not what he claims to be. And when they stop at an inn, Emerald meets a woman with a hideous good-luck charm and a sad-faced doctor who asks for her help. She and Wart soon become enmeshed in a frightening tangle of sorcerers, rogue White Sisters, and a political plot that stretches to the King himself.<br />Duncan shifts effortlessly into kids/YA territory, with minimal awkwardness. This book is essentially a clean, profanity-less version of his adult Blade tales, with the same fast pacing and heavy machinations. He doesn't dumb down anything for the kids, and so adults will probably enjoy \\"Sir Stalwart\\" as much as their kids will. The only signs of transition problems are things like Wart thinking \\"Oh, vomit!\\" (at an all-boys academy, he didn't learn to swear?) or the comment \\"Peculiarer and peculiarer\\" (an awkward homage to Lewis Carroll?).<br />His fantasy world is very like medieval Europe, with some not-so-subtle differences. The idea of the Blades (who obey their king because of a magical ritual where they get stuck through the heart with a sword) is exceptional, and plenty is done with this idea. The White Sisters are also given some more dimension, a nunlike order that has the ability to detect magic. Duncan displays that even they are subject to political pressure, even if the means to an end are wrong.<br />Wart is a likeable hero: He shows fear, courage, irritation, cockiness, humility, and occasionally rage that overshadows everything else. In a reversal of \\"you can't judge a book by its cover,\\" his sweet boyish exterior hides a passionate swordsman with a somewhat seedy past. Emerald (also known as Lucy Pillow) is a good counterpart as the cool-headed voice of reason, a strong female character with a brain -- and perhaps a future love interest in Wart. Sir Snake will catch attention and interest of the readers, while the repugnant Thrusk will have readers hoping that Wart dispatches him in a particularly gross way.<br />Fans and newcomers to the Blades series will love this fast-paced, high-intensity fantasy thriller.

As a part of the &quot;Great Author Series,&quot; three of his best short stories are presented in a sturdy hardcover edition<br />&quot;The Other Foot&quot; takes place twenty years after African-Americans left Earth for Mars, and have lived peacefully for many years in an enviroment free of racism and segregation. But old grudges and hatreds flare up when a Caucasian man arrives in a rocketship.<br />&quot;April Witch&quot; is about Cecy, a part of the bizarre Family also featured in &quot;From the Dust Returned.&quot; The immortal, mind-travelling Cecy longs to fall in love, but the only way she can is to temporarily possess the body of a young girl and romance a mortal man...<br />&quot;The Veldt&quot; is a chilling look at what happens in a mechanized house where a holographic nursery begins to exert a mysterious power over its inhabitants.<br />Ray Bradbury's mastering of the subtle message, the sense of the surreal, and a growing sense of horror are well shown in this collection. His prose is spare and his dialogue is simple, but each story packs a punch. This edition is also very well bound, with a pleasant hard cover and thick, smooth paper. And as an extra bonus, there are study guides for each of the three stories, and a biography of the author at the end<br />For those new to Bradbury, this is a good introduction with some of his best material.	2002-09-25

But fans of haunted houses and mysterious family secrets will enjoy this a great deal.<br />Lia is an unspectacular member of a family known for its impressive women. When her great-grandmother dies, she tells Lia that their ancestral house, Graymoss, must be preserved -- even though it is thought to be hideously evil. However, Lia's blindly optimistic parents have an obsessive dream of adopting a dozen \\"unadoptable\\" children, and are determined to turn Graymoss into a home for those kids. Lia is less than thrilled about the idea, both because of the disruption of her life and because of the ghosts.<br />Before leaving, Lia purchases a bag of voodoo gris-gris that will repel ghosts. And soon she finds that she needs it -- strange gusts of wind, a crashing window, a falling book, and a strange indentation in her bed. Her parents refuse to believe that there is anything strange about the house, but Lia can feel a malevolent presence. Armed with gris-gris, a cryptic diary and a collection of Poe's stories, she must try to banish the evil forces from Graymoss.<br />Nixon crafts a good story with plenty of sprinkled clues, family conflicts, and a big creaky house with no bathrooms. Her dialogue is pleasantly solid and believable, without fake witticisms or overly complex monologues. It's easy to imagine real people saying these words. Her portrayals of the family and their differing views on Graymoss were exceptionally done. And the mystery clues sprinkled in the Poe book and the old diary from a Civil War Southern belle were also clever and pulled the various threads of the story together.<br />Unfortunately, this book is not particularly scary. The ghostly interludes are few and far between, and even when they do surface, they are not particularly detailed or frightening -- Nixon seems to be stuck on plaster faces that move and gusts of wind, because the \\"boo!\\" effects never progress beyond that. She also inserts a lukewarm love interest and a subplot about the unadoptable kids. While these are good in themselves, they seem rather pointless as nothing is really done with them.<br />Lia is a likeable heroine; she's really accomplished nothing noteworthy, but doesn't allow that fact to get her down. She also shows extraordinary patience with her dewy-eyed parents, who for all their talk about \\"reality\\" seem to have very little grasp on it. Their reckless plans to adopt \\"unadoptable\\" kids (who are often unadoptable for very good reasons) will have many readers rolling their eyes. Her grandmother exhibits a different kind of irritating stubbornness, but one that readers will warm to much more readily.<br />Despite the drawbacks, this is a pretty solid historical mystery -- but the realm of the juvenile horror story is still John Bellairs's.

One outstanding example would be \\"Spell of the Sorcerer's Skull,\\" a genuinely creepy little horror story tinged with clever humor.<br /><br />Professor Childermass's car breaks down in a small town. While he waits for it to be repaired, he and his young friend Johnny Dixon are shown a dollhouse connected to the professor's grandfather, who died under mysterious circumstances. Johnny finds a tiny skull, which he finds he can't speak to anyone else about -- then he has a vision of a ghostly figure killing the old man. Soon afterwards, Professor Childermass vanishes under mysterious circumstances.<br /><br />Johnny finally approaches the priest Father Higgins, who promises to help if he can. A petition to Saint Andrew provides sudden answers, in the form of a cryptic rhyme that leads Johnny, Fergie and Father Higgins to a remote island in Maine. But even if they can find the professor, how can they defeat the evil forces that center on the sorcerer's skull?<br /><br />John Bellairs had a very clever knack for spooking people, scattering creepy elements through \\"Spell of the Sorcerer's Skull\\" like a farmer strewing seeds. He has creepy caretakers, Victorian mansions, an enchanted skull and visions of evil skeleton scarecrows -- and while these things just sound a little cheesy, he imbues them with a dark, eerie feeling that seems to cling to even the innocent scenes.<br /><br />But as usual, he also injects plenty of quirky humor into the story, such as Father Higgins whipping out a guitar and singing a folk song (much to Johnny's bewilderment). It's a good balance to the darker elements of the story. The only problem is that some of the plot twists seem rather contrived, but the story is a fairly decent one despite that flaw.<br /><br />He also uses this book to introduce the character of Father Higgins, a gruff but kindly priest who serves as the adult authority figure in this book since the professor is, obviously, nowhere to be seen. He's not quite as knowledgeable as the professor, but he serves as a good temporary replacement, and he works well with the complementary buddies Johnny and Fergie.<br /><br />\\"Spell of the Sorcerer's Skull\\" is a genuinely spine-tingling nugget of kiddie horror, and despite no longer being a kid, I still feel a chill at some of the darker moments.

Those books were finished by Brad Strickland, utilizing the author's remaining outlines. It's a solid thriller with a few seams showing, but overall a good read for those not yet ready for Stephen King.<br />Kindly witch Mrs. Zimmermann has lost her magic, except for a sixth sense and a residual aura of unusable protective magic, and Rose Rita Pottinger has broken her ankle. Her friends Jonathan and Lewis Barnavelt have left the two behind, while on their European vacation. But suddenly Mrs. Zimmermann is called on a mission into the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country, and Rose Rita comes with her. Naturally, nothing proceeds as expected. Their car is transported back in time and crashes, leaving the two staying with the kindly Weiss family.<br />But the mystery deepens when the reason for their time travelling is revealed -- the ghost of the witch Hilda Wetherbee tells them that she has transported them back in time to save a good wizard, Grandpa Drexel, who is fated to die on the first of April. But an evil presence disrupts the message from Granny Wetherbee, and Mrs. Zimmermann becomes stricken with partial amnesia Rose Rita becomes increasingly suspicious that a hexer -- an evil witch -- is trying to drive out the Weiss family. But how can a de-magicked witch and a bespelled modern girl hope to stop a hexer -- and a demon?<br />This is neither the spookiest nor the tightest of Bellairs' fantasy-horror books, and it suffers slightly from an unfortunate cliche (time travel) and a dependence on previous Bellairs books. But it's a solid time-travel/ghost-story, with some hideously chilling scenes and some interesting new characters. There's a bit of a dull section in the middle, but Strickland picks up the pace near the end with some delightfully Bellairsian scenes of horror when Rose Rita inadvertantly conjures up the demon Aziel. And for people looking for a little educational info, there's some enlightening passages about the Pennsylvania Dutch.<br />Rose Rita is shown without the shadow of Lewis here, and while she is not quite as interesting as the timid ex-altar boy, she's a good heroine who shows a lot of the characteristics of her best friend. Mrs. Zimmermann is given extra dimension as she tries to regain her magical powers and gets stricken with amnesia. We also get to see two dimensions of Hilda Wetherbee -- as the ghost of a crabby old witch, and as a little girl who befriends Rose Rita. Favorites Jonathan and Lewis Barnavelt even show up for a cameo appearance.<br />While not the most outstanding of Bellairs' books, this is a good, spooky read, especially for fans of Rose Rita and Mrs. Zimmermann.

While it doesn't quite measure up to the first book of the series, it manages to be a solid fantasy story that continues from the prior storyline.<br />A strange young girl, Shaiala, wanders in the desert, remembering how a herd of young centaurs -- with whom she has lived her whole life -- was kidnapped by frightening \\"Two Hoofs.\\" Now Shaiala ends up at the Echorium, home of the Singers who can provide laughter, fear, relaxation, and death with their songs. They believe centaurs to be mere myths, but it proves that the girl's mind has been tampered with. And a young trainee named Renn proves to be the key when he understands her \\"half speech.\\"<br />The key to Shaiala's experiences is apparently a crystal mask, but she is reluctant to trust any of the \\"Two Hoofs.\\" And Renn isn't too crazy about Shaiala either -- it's rumored that anyone who understands half-speech will later go insane. He, Shaiala, a desert prince sold into slavery, and two very familiar Singers will venture out -- and confront a vengeful enemy that everyone had thought to be gone.<br />Perhaps the greatest weakness of this book is that to understand its plot, you need to have read the first book. Old friends and enemies crop up, with cameos by the merlee and a few mentions of quetzal. Readers will also enjoy reading about Rialle, Kherron and Frenn -- who all serve unusual roles in Renn's life. But their existance, and that of the villain, won't make much sense unless you have first read \\"Song Quest.\\" And the pacing seems a little off, especially when it accelerates during the final pages.<br />Renn is a good reluctant hero; he doesn't want to leave his home, where he has never really felt comfortable anyhow. But his quest serves to make him more tolerant and mature, and gives him some new insights into his past. Shaiala provides both some fire to the narrative, and some mild comic turns when she kicks people. Roberts keeps readers in the dark for quite some time as to what is going on with Shaiala, and whether the centaurs are real, or a part of her altered memory. And the low-key desert prince Erihan serves as a good damper on Shaiala's frustration and loneliness.<br />While not quite as good as the first book, \\"Crystal Mask\\" is an intriguing fantasy read for kids and adults alike, and offers promise for Roberts' future Echorium books.mic turns when she kicks people.

With the warped worldview and hilarious self-deprecation of a Jewish Dave Barry, Kornheiser skewers the absurdities of everyday life -- and a few items that aren't so everyday. (\\"Nudes on Ice\\" being an example of the latter)<br />Tony offers his commentary on presidential golf (\\"Republicans hit players, Democrats hit on them\\"); Chinese food and why it will kill you, and what this means for the Jewish community; men's behinds and the revelation that women look at them; bringing food into movie theaters; gyms and how awful it is to work out -- especially if you are already fat; the truth behind the NC-17 rating; Barbie dolls; the differences between the sexes (\\"I busted Jason's nose\\"); various names from around the world (\\"I am grateful to my parents for naming me Anthony Irwin Kornheiser because it gives me license to say anything I want about other people's names\\"); yuppie catalogs with designer birdfeed and \\"Soap on a Rope\\"; and many, many more.<br />Tony has a wonderfully open mind -- he makes fun of pretty much everybody, regardless of race, gender, politics, class, and just about anything else. He frequently gets embarrassed and befuddled by the events in this book. And like his friend Dave Barry (who provides him with an incredibly funny cover quote) Tony says things in such a way that they make a great deal of absurd sense.<br />\\"Pumping Irony\\" is the antidote to boredom.

Lewis Barnavelt and Rose Rita Pottinger are at their best here.<br />Jonathan Barnavelt receives the news that a friend -- another wizard -- has recently died, and posthumously asks that Jonathan and Mrs. Zimmermann take care of his old magical objects. The two leave New Zebedee, and Rose Rita and Lewis are left to their own devices. They explore an old opera house and find a crumbling old opera called \\"Day of Doom,\\" by Immanuel Vanderhelm. As Lewis finds the opera, he sees a ghostly dead man who calls out \\"Beware the doom of the haunted opera! He means to be King of the Dead!\\"<br />Then a strange man appears in the town, claiming to Vanderhelm's grandson. He means to put on as performance of the opera, and at first everything appears to be all right. But soon all the adults in the town are enamored -- and enspelled -- by Henry Vanderhelm, communications with the outside world are cut off, wizards are locked in their houses, and Lewis sees a tomb statue come alive in the graveyard. With the help of a well-meaning ghost and a grandmotherly witch, can Rose Rita and Lewis hope to stop the raising of the dead?<br />Anyone who has suffered through a badly-performed opera will enjoy the idea of one being a necromancer's spell. The imaginative plot base is only one of the appealing things about \\"Doom.\\" The incredibly grim and tense plot is leavened by humor, such as Jailbird the whistling cat and Finster, a ghost who inadvertantly freaks out Lewis with ghostly intonations, then makes himself sound more friendly. Aside from the usual fears of evil sorcerers, there is also the chilling fact that the capable adults are not present throughout much of the book -- we get to see how Lewis and Rose Rita can try to handle the situation on their own. Any kid who has had to deal with a crisis on their own can relate to the fear and frustration of the heroes in this book.<br />Lewis is, as always, a sweet timid boy who has more guts than he knows. Rose Rita is his equal friend (she can't really be classified as a sidekick) who has to take matters into her own hands when Lewis vanishes. Mrs. Jaeger is a little too vague to be entirely believable, but the idea of an absent-minded grandmotherly witch is a nice one. The deceased Finster is a good source for plot-related info, and mildly amusing as well. And Vanderhelm is an outstandingly sinister villain.<br />Full of the funny and the spooky, this is a first-rate thriller for fans of fantasy, horror, and John Bellairs.

Jane Yolen draws on some of the themes she does best for this book, and the result definitely won't disappoint.<br />Richard is a dreamy young boy who is sick a great deal, and as a result he reads a great deal. And when he gets a glimpse of a white animal running through the woods near his home, he is convinced that it is the mythical unicorn. But it is also seen by Heather Fielding (referred to simply as an \\"enjoyer\\") who becomes entwined in Richard's search for the unicorn.<br />Heather is skeptical of Richard's claim, thinking that the creature is really an albino deer. However she begins to agree with Richard, and the two becomes friends as they research unicorns. But when the white hart is threatened by discovery, will their friendship be strong enough?<br />Perhaps the worst thing about \\"Transfigured Hart\\" is that it can be read in about half an hour, and as a result the reader may be left craving more and finding that there's nothing more. The writing ranges from the everyday to the absolutely mystical, sprinkled through with trivia and legends about unicorns without seeming too instructional. And in true Yolen style, there is always the question of what exactly the white hart is -- did Richard and Heather see a unicorn, or did they see what they wanted to see? What kind of creature is it? The short chapters focusing on it will have readers puzzling it out.<br />Richard will capture the attention and sympathy of the readers. He's a Fox Mulder of the fantastical, a kid who can wholeheartedly believe in things that others scoff at as legends. At the same time, he acknowledges the origins and legends. Heather is a less believable character, as she often seems a little forced in her attitude. But the testing of their friendship is well-done.<br />Yolen aptly displays that the unicorn was not always a cute little decoration, but a compelling legend and a powerful symbol. \\"Transfigured Hart\\" is a simple and beautiful story, which anyone looking for an unusual, well-written read should check out.a powerful symbol. \\"Transfigured Hart\\" is a simple and beautiful story, which anyone looking for an unusual, well-written read should check out.	2002-09-21

The reprinting of this all-too-short novella will, however, probably delight fans of his Newford series and other \\"urban fantasies.\\" I confess to not being a huge fan of either, but I did find \\"Dreaming Place\\" a moderately enjoyable fantasy story.<br />Ashley's mother was recently murdered, and her father doesn't want her around. She ends up being shrugged off on her kindly but hippieish aunt and uncle, and her nervous cousin Nina. There, Ashley buys occult books, plays heavy metal, alarms Nina into thinking that she is a witch, and cultivates a core of anger at her life in general. Her only real friends are a street tarot reader and a slightly eccentric shaman (who is, for some reason, called \\"Bones\\").<br />But soon Bones whisks Ashley off to the mystical Otherworld, a place of legends and spirits. A bloodthirsty spirit called a manitou is stalking Nina, who was accidently dedicated to her as a baby.  In the real world, Nina struggles to escape  strange specters and a homicidal stranger who knows about the manitou's pursuit of her. Ashley must try to save her cousin -- and will learn a few things about herself in the process.<br />\\"The Dreaming Place\\" is not a bad novella, it's just not a particularly good one. While de Lint is now experienced and has written many books, it becomes evident when reading this that it was written early in his career. The pacing essentially alternates between being sluglike and fast, with high-activity stuff with Nina in the real life in one chapter and more agonizing soul-searching by Ashley in the next. It's somewhat too short for the wealth of potential material, zipping through in just over a hundred pages, zipping straight into the action without much buildup. The writing is often very poetic, but hints that it could be more. And de Lint displays a lack of subtlety, as he is inclined to spell things out rather than allowing readers to pick up on their own.<br />Unfortunately Ashley is perhaps the least interesting character in the book. Her in-depth soul-searching with a spirit is dull to the point of page flipping, and her cliched \\"righteous anger\\" that needs to be unkinked is her sole distinguishing characteristic. She reminded me of the worse heroines by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes. I found the nervous but pleasant Nina to be a nice character, one who tries to regain some control over her destiny as it supernaturally spirals out of control. Native American shaman Bones will also appeal to fans of the Obi-Wan Kenobi wise-old-mentor archetype.<br />If you are a de Lint fan or a fan of urban fantasy, you may enjoy this book.

He soon acquires a travelling companion, a pit bull called Ish, who was abandoned as Harley feels he has been; soon after, the two are given a ride by an elderly woman named May, who is trying to forge a new life for herself after her husband left her. Though she doesn't want the responsibility of a boy and a dog, she allows Harley to come with her to her run-down little house.<br />There they find a relentlessly Pollyannaish girl, Singer, who tells them that a junk-collecting drifter called Bill has been living -- and collecting junk -- in the house. Bill and May clash when he returns from the hospital (after setting his bedpan on fire to create a diversion while he escaped), with her ordering him to leave and him refusing. Singer offers philosophical advice, while Harley struggles with his lack of roots and his longing for even the vestiges of a home. But it seems that the collection of lost souls will never be able to exist in peace. Only a tragedy can give them the true soul of a family.<br />Every sitcom has brought up the concept that family is defined more by love than by blood. Sebestyen adds extra dimensions to this by producing a group of misfits -- not all of them get along, and more often than not they don't. But neither do they despise one another. The paths of Bill and May make it difficult to accept Harley, and Harley's past makes him increasingly desperate for love.<br />Harley is an unusually deep teenage character with a quietly likeable personality. Anyone who has felt alone or unloved -- or who HAS been alone or unloved -- will sympathize with his longing for someone to care about what happens to him. His outbursts as he realizes that nobody is going to keep him on are well-written, as are his feelings of guilt after Ish is injured. Singer is a little harder to care about, as Sebestyen seems to have tried a little too hard to make her relentlessly optimistic -- a few chinks in her armor would have made her seem more human and interesting. May is too similar to Harley for her own comfort, wounded by the loss of her lying husband and closed off emotionally, even to someone who needs her. Bill is the kindly curmudgeon, a cranky old guy who unconsciously becomes the paternal figure that Harley lacks. His almost comic stubbornness will win over most of the readers.<br />People who need continuous hijinks and action won't like this book -- the pace is gradual and attention is paid to the characters. Aside from a minor accident, it's all introspection drama, with a splash of comedy from time to time. Sebestyen's style is informative but kind of stark, with all the detail inside the characters' heads. She also does not lapse into the preachy \\"all you need is love to be a family\\" cliche, instead allowing the readers to draw their own conclusions from what happens to whom. As a result, the book's finale feels less like an end than like the climax of a very long beginning.<br />For a beautiful, carefully written story filled with likeably odd characters, readers can't do better than \\"Out of Nowhere.\\" An excellent work of fiction for any age.unloved -- will sympathize with his longing for someone to care about what happens to him.

Shea, Allanon reveals, is the last descendent of Jerle Shannara, and the only person who can use the Sword of Shannara. When dark forces draw closer to Shady Vale, Shea escapes with his brother Flick. They and a band of Elves, Dwarves, humans, and Allanon set out toward untold peril to recover the Sword.<br /><br />\\"Elfstones of Shannara\\" starts with the Ellcrys, an Elven tree that protects the world, starting to die. Without its magic, demons will swarm over the world and obliterate the inhabitants of all species, unless a new Ellcrys can be planted in time. Wil Ohmsford and an Elf called Amberle Elessedil set out to get a seed for the new Ellcrys -- but a hideous demon known as the Reaper is stalking them...<br /><br />\\"Wishsong of Shannara\\" wraps up the initial trilogy with a new threat to the world in general: Mord Wraiths are going out to attack mankind, and the new Ohmsford hero, Brin, is the only one who can stop them. Her \\"wishsong\\" can defeat this evil, and so she comes with Ohmsford and a new band of heroes -- but a prophecy threatens them all.<br /><br />There is no doubt about it -- \\"Sword\\" is clearly a ripoff of \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" The Elves, Dwarves, evil creatures, even the background of the bad guy are just the same -- dozens of other things, such as Shady Vale and the spiderlike mutant beastie, are reminiscent of things in Middle-Earth. However, Brooks shows a distinct effort to distance himself from Tolkien in the second and third books; additionally, unlike many derivative authors, he also gives a postapocalyptic spin to his story that offers a semi-scientific explanation for dwarves, gnomes and monsters.<br /><br />Brooks also, to his credit, knows how to write. There are some overly-descriptive passages and some long stretches of boredom, but overall he manages to keep the reader's attention riveted. Some scenes, such as one in \\"Sword\\" where the various characters are led into a chamber that can cause madness, are written with exquisite skill. He also knows his limitations: Unlike many authors, he doesn't lapse into pseudo-ye-olde-style dialogue in an effort to imitate Tolkien. And unlike many authors who retain the same characters for twenty or thirty books, Brooks alters his cast to keep them fresh.<br /><br />His characters are pleasant enough; some are a little flat, but they're not annoying and a few are outright charming.

Now the evil-battling priest slips into the spotlight in an intriguing ghost story. Though not Bellairs' best, it's a chilling and fast-paced thriller for the pre-Stephen King set.<br />Johnny Dixon is depressed when his friend Father Higgins is transferred to a different parish. Father Higgins isn't much happier, since he dislikes his new congregation, and his estranged mother has just died. Soon he visits his friends Johnny and Professor Childermass, claiming that a ghost has been trying to contact him, that he is sleepwalking, and he shows them a strange glassy half-plate with golden fishes in it, and a cryptic rhyme.<br />Soon afterward, Father Higgins vanishes. The professor, Johnny, and Fergie go to England in an effort to track him -- and find that he is in the grip of a demonic dead knight, part of the pirate De Marisco knights that died long ago -- after some sold their souls to the devil. Now the evil knight known as Masterman is trying to set his old comrades free...<br />This book has the staples of a good Bellairs book -- evil sorcerers/ghosts/monsters/beasties that will either destroy the world or conquer it, spinechilling chapter endings, cryptic rhymes, and a lot of witty banter between Childermass and other characters. It's not quite as horrifying as some of the other Bellairs books, but it's definitely a good ghost story. Perhaps its greatest weaknesses are that the pacing seems to meander, and some of the plot twists are a bit strained. (Where did Bellairs get the line, \\"And in case you're wondering, he has developed his powers of ESP\\"?)<br />Johnny and Fergie are good as always, the meek Charlie Brown altar boy and the cocky gutsy kid who complement each other like peanut-butter and jelly. Father Higgins is given extra dimension, provided with his sad past with his estranged mother and his wish that he had reconciled with her. And Professor Childermass is his usual grumpy, irritable, generous and brave self.<br />\\"Secret of the Underground Room\\" is not Bellairs' best, but it's definitely a solid ghost-story withhildermass is his usual grumpy, irritable, generous and brave self.<br />\\"Secret of the Underground Room\\" is not Bellairs' best, but it's definitely a solid ghost-story with	2002-09-12

A series of short stories strung together into a novel might sound like a disastrous idea. But the illustrious Ray Bradbury manages to pull it off in \\"From the Dust Returned.\\" You thought your family was weird? Just wait until you see the Family reuniting at the House.<br />The House is a dusty gothic place somewhere in the Midwest, and its inhabitants are far from ordinary. There is the mummified Granmere in the attic, the undead parents, an intelligent spider, the beautiful Cecy who sleeps and dreams -- and can \\"yank your soul like an aching tooth and shoot it into clouds to cool your spirit,\\" and Timothy, the only mortal, truly human member of the Family.<br />And now others in the Family are coming to the House: ghosts and winged men, werewolves and vampires. Old stories are told: Of Angelina Marguerite, who ages in reverse so that she can be reborn. Of Uncle Einar, whose life is changed by his challenge of the skies. Of Cecy, who longs to fall in love and uses another woman's body to do so. Of four adolescent boys who end up bodiless. And ultimately, the story of Timothy, the House, and the ever-changing world.<br />Ray Bradbury manages to create a darker, more mystical version of the Addams Family (funnily enough, Charles Addams illustrated this novel's cover). The Family is a true motley crew, funny and sad and poignant and sometimes even a little naughty. Cecy's pursuit of love stands in stark contrast to Uncle Einar helping his wife with the laundry. The most lighthearted of the stories is about four adolescent boys running wild in their grandfather's memory. However, there is also a saddening undertone; lead character Timothy is the only person there who will age and die, and he feels somehow inferior to the rest of the Family. But Bradbury never makes him seem inferior; instead, his life as an ordinary human is a blessing.<br />The Family itself is full of the weird and wonderful. Though these people are not human and are endowed with superhuman powers, their emotions and responses are just like those of ordinary relatives. But near the finale, we are reminded that they lack some of the best things about humans, and that belief and cynicism have a great impact upon them. It's a moving and thought-provoking passage.<br />The writing is unusually poetic and dreamy, and dialogue ranges from mediocre romance-novel to prose equal to Patricia McKillip's. There is a slightly disjointed feel to the middle of this novel. As it was originally interconnected short stories, this isn't surprising. It may also be a little bit of a jolt for readers to go from a sad story to a funny one so quickly, within the same storyline. And Cecy seems to have some major shifts in personality between stories.<br />Flaws aside, this is a wonderful fantasy/horror novel, with a great cast of characters, a likeable hero and a enjoyable loose-knit storyline. A must-read, even if you're not a fan of Bradbury or dark fantasy in general. Whoever said the Midwest was boring?heir emotions and responses are just like those of ordinary relatives.

With the advent of the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It has quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it, and helped spawn such entertainment phenomena as \\"Star Wars.\\"<br />Following up on events in \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" stars the quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that he has learned something: The Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed.<br />\\"The Two Towers\\" begins directly after \\"Fellowship,\\" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam, and his cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs of the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised.<br />\\"Return of the King\\" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.<br />\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien drew on his experiences in World War I, the ravaged battlefields, and the mechanization of the countryside for the most moving passages of the book. His beliefs beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.<br />Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of how he is influenced by the Ring. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage over the course of the trilogy. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual Obi-Wan Kenobi wizards. Merry and Pippin start out as a chirpy boy and a well-meaning flake, but are matured and made more multi-dimensional by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.<br />Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue ranges from absolutely hilarious to solemn and biblical, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary; if you don't have a good attention span, then you won't be able to handle this story.<br />This particular edition is pretty good. The binding is fairly strong and tight, necessary for a book of over one thousand pages. The paper is of goodquality, very pale and in stark contrast to the dark type. So if you want an edition that holds up well under abuse, this is a good one to try out.<br />Even after all the years, \\"Lord\\" still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature.

When he dies, however, she finds herself essentially penniless and forced to head to New England to live with her aunt and her family. But Connecticut is very different from the sunny island the \\"tropical bird\\" left behind: Bleak, muddy, dreary, and filled with grim Puritans -- including her relatives. Her stern uncle disapproves of Kit's upbringing, her love of books, her flamboyant clothing, and her lack of experience in housework.<br />Kit tries to fit in with the proud, beautiful Judith and quiet crippled Mercy, but she isn't a Puritan and it shows. Her only friend is the sardonic sailer Nat, who alternately irritates and interests her. Then Kit encounters Hannah, a sweet old Quaker woman who lives as an outcast because of her religious beliefs. When rumors of witchcraft start flying, Kit must try to save first Hannah -- and then herself -- from the witch hunters.<br />Without actually time-travelling, nobody can know what it would be like to live among the Puritans. But Speare gives us an approximation -- Kit is smart, witty, tolerant, adventurous and serves as a doormat for no one. She's much closer to a modern teenage girl than to the Puritans, and so her conflicts with her unyielding uncle are very illustrative. Among these are the dislike of non-religious reading, insistence on continuous hard work with only a few interludes of fun, and one memorable scene where Kit tries to give her cousins some of her beautiful clothes -- only to have her uncle explode when he sees them. We also see some demonstrations of how often religious intolerance blinded these people to a person's true nature, giving them a scapegoat for their fear of the unknown. However, it is stressed that while the Puritans were intolerant and rigid, individuals were good underneath it -- such as when Kit's uncle defends her against the witch-hunters.<br />There's a little romance in this book, including a love pentagon worthy of Shakespeare (fortunately matters sort themselves out), and this is one area where Speare stumbles. The love tangles seem a little too contrived. However, she includes a fair number of details on life in New England at that time, but never becomes too engrossed in them that she loses track of the plot. The pace is fairly slow until the witch trials; younger kids may be bored by this, but older ones will not mind so much.<br />Kit is a great heroine -- flawed but always sympathetic, funny and strong, brave and intelligent. Fortunately Speare never falls into the trap of simply transporting a modern girl back in time. Judith, Nat and Hannah are also great supporting characters: Nat is great as the sarcastic but supportive love interest. Hannah is a sweet old woman who is content to live a simple life. And Judith will earn both irritation and liking for her pride and determination. Characters like Mercy and the aunt and uncle are a little less three-dimensional; Mercy never rises from the cliche of the gentle, sweet disabled girl, and the aunt and uncle are a doormat and a tyrant most of the time, although the uncle does rise up with some good moments. Extra love interests William and John are also pretty flat: William is a bit like a brainless puppy panting at Kit's feet, and John is a humorless Biblical scholar.

James Spada aspires to create a shattering and shocking biography of the late Princess Grace Grimaldi, nee Grace Kelly. Unfortunately his biography reads less like a biography than like a listing of the affairs and miserable times she had.<br />It covers the background that Grace Kelly came from, and her rapid ascent into the Hollywood spotlight, where she became an adored and talented actress. She won the hearts of the public anew when she married Prince Rainier of Monaco, helped pull his small principality back into the spotlight -- and died tragically in a car crash at a relatively young age.<br />Spada certainly had the material for a good book in his hands, but like many other so-called biographers of famous and beloved personages, he descends to essentially repeating every little tabloid report and insinuation. Every one of Grace's lovers is listed, with Spada showing especial glee when the man in question was married. Literally half the book is taken up by descriptions of who she slept with and, very briefly, the movies she made. After reading this book, readers will be hard-put to remember the plots of her movies, but they will be able to remember her mother's argument with Oleg Cassini. Additionally, the only interactions in her life in Monaco that he focuses on are negative; one would think that Grace didn't have a satisfying five seconds after she married Rainier.<br />Similar treatment is given to her family. Rainier is a nebulous presence at best -- what little we hear is never enough to let us form a real picture of him as a person. Virtually no attention is paid to Caroline's role as First Lady, but plenty is paid to her tempestuous love life. Albert's adult life is summed up in a listing of his lovers, and Stephanie's accomplishments are crammed into a page and a half, in comparison to the pages dedicated to rebellion and, yes, her love life. To add insult to this amalgation of tabloid rumors, Spada even presents the assertion of a tabloid stringer that Grace's death was an attempted murder/suicide.<br />His writing style is dry and rushed. It is also repetitive; he often restates items such as the fiery personality under the ice queen exterior, or Grace's beauty, or how she only became involved with men if she believed they would marry her. Rather than grouping relevant quotes together, he allows them to crop up at random through the book.<br />For a better look at Grace's life, her flaws and gifts, and the lives of her family, try \\"Royal House of Monaco.\\" If you're looking for a pointless listing of Grace's lovers, this is the book for you.hat Grace's death was an attempted murder/suicide.<br />His writing style is dry and rushed.

Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien drew on his experiences in World War I, the ravaged battlefields, and the mechanization of the countryside for the most moving passages of the book. His beliefs beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.<br />Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of how he is influenced by the Ring. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage over the course of the trilogy. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual Obi-Wan Kenobi wizards. Merry and Pippin start out as a chirpy boy and a well-meaning flake, but are matured and made more multi-dimensional by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.<br />Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue ranges from absolutely hilarious to solemn and biblical, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary; if you don't have a good attention span, then you won't be able to handle this story.<br />Even after all the years, \\"Lord\\" still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and noone book has even come close to equalling it.one book has even come close to equalling it.	2002-08-31

Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman -- and it doesn't matter if it's a kid's book.<br /><br />And \\"Coraline\\" -- now being released as a movie -- is no exception to Gaiman's track record. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous \\"other\\" world.<br /><br />Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (not \\"Caroline\\" is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring.<br /><br />It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a formerly bricked-up door that leads into an apartment in another world, which looks eerily like her own.  In fact, it's so similar that she has a taloned, button-eyed \\"other mother\\" and matching \\"other father,\\" as well as a chorus of singing, dancing rats and magical toys.<br /><br />At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are very attentive. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.<br /><br />Without Neil Gaiman's touch, \\"Coraline\\" would just be another story about a kid who learns to appreciate her parents. But he infuses this story with a dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children in a mirror, beetles, disembodied hands, monsters that cling to the wall with souls in their grip, and rats that sing about how \\"we were here before you rose, we will be here when you fall.\\"<br /><br />That dark, cobwebby atmosphere clings to the increasingly nightmarish plot, as Coraline navigates a world where the other mother has every advantage. And Gaiman's wordcraft is exquisitely horrible -- the other mother's hands are compared to spiders, her hair to undersea tentacles. And the fate of the other father is a magnificently ghastly thing.<br /><br />He even infuses poetry into the horror (\\"A husk you'll be, a wisp you'll be, and a thing no more than a dream on waking, or a memory of something forgotten\\"), and a fair amount of macabre humour  (\\"I swear it on my own mother's grave.\\" \\"Does she have a grave?\\" \\"Oh yes. I put her in there myself. And when I found her trying to crawl out, I put her back\\").<br /><br />Coraline herself is a wonderful little heroine -- strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her. The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint. And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares -- she's utterly inhuman and merciless -- who  \\"wants something to love. Something that isn't her. She might want something to eat as well.\\"<br /><br />Neil Gaiman creates eerie, slightly warped worlds like nobody else, and he does an exquisitely horrible job in \\"Coraline.\\" Just never go through the door.man's wordcraft is exquisitely horrible -- the other mother's hands are compared to spiders, her hair to undersea tentacles.

But what is not widely-known about him is that he also fought in World War I, of which his experiences are recorded in \\"Tales of War.\\"<br />\\"Prayer of the Men of Daleswood\\" is unusual for Dunsany, in that it is entirely composed of a monologue about a village called Daleswood. \\"Road\\" is a touching story about the \\"road\\" to peace that the men killed in the war had made. \\"Imperial Monument\\" reflects on the lasting effects of the war on France, Germany, and others. \\"Walk to the Trenches\\" is a meditative examination of the landscape around the trenches. \\"Walk in Picardy\\" offers a look into the trek of a soldier into the trenches. \\"What Happened on the Night of the Twenty-Seventh\\" is a story about Dick Cheeser, a pleasantly ordinary English boy who has his first night as a sentry. \\"Standing To\\" is about the dawn on the battlefield. \\"Splendid Traveller\\" hints at fantasy, the story of a British airman. \\"England\\" is a solid little dialogue-driven tale where a Private and a Sargeant have a talk about sausages, gardens, and other things in England. \\"Shells\\" is Dunsany's description of German guns and shells; there is something almost alarmingly clinical about this essay, until the final paragraph. \\"Two Degrees of Envy\\" is a unique story, about two unfortunate men -- one English, one German -- who are envied by their former comrades. \\"Master of No Man's Land\\" is a mildly humorous story about a rutabaga.<br />\\"Weeds and Wire\\" is a rather sad story about English soldiers wandering through the ruins of a French village. \\"Spring in England and Flanders\\" reflects on two different springs in two different countries -- one intact, one a wasteland. \\"Nightmare Countries\\" is a reflection on the hideous condition of WWI France. \\"Spring and the Kaiser\\" sadly reflects on how the German leaders weren't happy with simple, peaceful contentment. \\"Two Songs\\" is about mirrored events in both England and France. \\"Punishment\\" is a haunting, Dickensian story about a phantom who takes the Kaiser on a tour of the homes that he has destroyed. \\"English Spirit\\" is about Cane, a man who has been to war and doesn't want to go again. \\"An Investigation Into the Causes and Origin of the War\\" is about the \\"imperial barber... that eccentric man whose name so few remember.\\" \\"Lost\\" is about the last chance of Hitler for redemption. \\"Last Mirage\\" is a poetic look at how France is a \\"desert\\" for the Nazis. \\"Famous Man\\" is about an unnamed, famous personage (Churchill?) who visits after World War I. \\"Oases of Death\\" is about tiny gravesites that are left green. \\"Anglo-Saxon Tyranny\\" is a reflection on American and English sea-power. \\"Memories\\" is a reflection on Ireland in the first World War. \\"Movement\\" is a story about a weird crank in England, who becomes very vocal upon the beginning of the war. \\"Nature's Cad\\" is a rather weird story about a gorilla. \\"Home of Herr Schnitzelhaaser\\" is a saddening story about an old man, an old woman, and their pig. \\"Deed of Mercy\\" is a demonstration about how even evil people can give acts of mercy. \\"Last Scene of All\\" is a saddening story about a dying man and what he sees. \\"Old England\\" is a fitting finale to the collection, in which old John Plowman thinks about the men injured in the war.<br />Though the events of this book are either real or set in real situations, there is a vague sense of unreality in almost all of them. Only a few don't display Dunsany's dreamy prose, such as \\"Prayer\\" and \\"England,\\" which have a solidly English feel to the dialogue and descriptions. The overall feeling of \\"Tales\\" is not anger or fear, but simply a sadness that all those people were killed, and the devastating effects on the countrypeople of both allies and enemies alike in the future.

Tolkien, he shows good insight into the ordinary guys who were called from peaceful country homes to fight.<br />For some G-rated insight into the minds of the soldiers in the World Wars, this is a unique and interesting collection of stories and essays.<br />For some G-rated insight into the minds of the soldiers in the World Wars, this is a unique and interesting collection of stories and essays.	2002-08-29

With plucky preteens, cartoonish baddies and a very energetic chimpanzee, this is a fun short read.<br />The tiny but self-important village of MacOongafoondsen (Population: 21) has been experiencing mysterious thefts, right before a strange, seemingly empty ship runs aground on the beach. Emmaline (not \\"Emma-leen\\") and her linguistically-gifted friend Flurp (actually \\"Philip\\") encounter a small, hairy, odd-looking creature who will only say \\"Eek,\\" locked in one of the ship's cabins.<br />The repugnant Bailiff Shmink and stupid Mayor Overbite immediately decide (in a display of hideous logic) that as the ship is foreign, it must be French, and as Monsieur Eek (as the stranger is now called) is a foreigner and has a lot of body hair, he must be a thief and a spy. As the daughter of the late mayor (before Overbite), Emmaline decides to be Eek's lawyer at a fair trial where the verdict has been pre-decided. But the mayor and bailiff manipulate the situation for their own ends...<br />\\"Monsieur Eek\\" is based on a legend, possibly true and possibly not, about a coastal town in England where a chimp was put on trial. Happily, Ives doesn't cling to historical fixings and instead provides a quirky cast of characters, cartoonish situations, and last-minute saves. One example, for instance, is Flurp wearing a baseball cap and eating sandwiches long before everyone else did. The writing style is quick and funny, full of hilarious or chilling situations, and the dialogue is pretty realistic overall.<br />Emmaline (whose picky pronunciation of her name is a running joke) is a good heroine, with a smotheringly nervous mother and a townfull of people who don't have her clear vision and sense of justice. Readers will feel almost as frustrated as she is. Flurp is a good sidekick, who recognizes what a good friend Emmaline is, and doesn't care how strange the townsfolk think he is. Monsieur Eek (or rather, Samuel) isn't in the book as much as the kids are, and somehow the monkey never becomes quite as lovable as his costars. The villains are stupid, illogical, bigoted, and willing to do anything for themselves -- and readers will hate them.<br />It's an entertaining little adventure, probably destined to be a favorite among fans of Lemony Snicket, as the writing styles are somewhat similar.

It shows a little roughness around the edges, less detailed writing, but kids will enjoy the adventures of Gareth and Jason.<br />Jason is up in his room after a fight with his mother and brother, with only his cat Gareth for company. To Jason's surprise, Gareth suddenly starts speaking to him. He is, unsurprisingly, a magical cat who can travel through time and space -- to any nine lives in the past. He takes Jason on a trip through time, to ancient Egypt where the boy-pharaoh wants to worship him; the Roman empire, where they are recruited by a legion and then captured by Celts; ancient Ireland, where they make enemies with a court magician and friends with a very special saint; Imperial Japan, where a young Emperor is given Gareth and a bunch of kittens as a gift; Renaissance Italy, where the two bump into a talented young painter;  Spanish-dominated Peru, where they befriend a scatterbrained, silver-tongued young captain; they introduce a special cat to the Isle of Man; witch-hunters in medieval Germany; and finally making friends with a kindly cat-peddler in 1775 Boston.<br />\\"Time Cat\\" has no central plot. Instead, it is a series of vignettes: A couple of chapters are devoted to each time period. It's like an extended daydream, displaying what are presumably the time periods that interest (or possibly frighten) Alexander himself. He also displays some educational material about cats -- how they were seen through history, things about Manx cats, and about all the roles that cats can play in a person's life.<br />Jason is a sympathetic kid, very quiet in nature (except for the brother-punching incident near the beginning) with some clear insights into cats and some fuzzier insights into history. Gareth is acool, calm, wise, serene -- the ideal cat, and he talks too! There are too many supporting characters to cover adequately, but some stand out in particular, such as Diahan, the Irish princess who shows signs of Alexander's later character Eilonwy, and Don Diego, a scatterbrained, homesick young Spaniard who gets things wrong -- but a few things very right.<br />Even people who don't like time travel stories may like this one, for its lack of pretension or faked dilemmas.

However, it is also an insightful study of human nature, good and evil, and an intriguing philosophical fantasy.<br />Bentley Ellicott was literally born to be a hero -- with a massive store of mythical knowledge and the information and a crippled leg. He knows that he was meant, like the thousand heroes before him since the beginning of time, to battle the incorporeal evil called Prince Ombra, who appears every so often to try to corrupt the world. Though he is considered peculiar and even dangerous by the inhabitants of his home town, he makes two friends: Slally, a girl who speaks in a nonsense language that only Bentley can understand, and Dietrich Kreistein, an elderly German shrink who gradually realizes who and what Bentley is.<br />The town is gradually being corrupted by malice as Ombra draws ever closer with confrontation in mind. Despite the finding of a magical stone that is the key to defeating Ombra, Bentley is tempted and shocked by new revelations about his family, his friends, the people around him -- and about himself. Will the thousand-and-first hero with a \\"borrowed heart\\" overcome his weaknesses and fears, or will Ombra triumph?<br />Perhaps the most moving message of \\"Prince Ombra\\" is that true heroes are not perfect, that they are tempted, sometimes fail, and need help like any other person. They also can't do everything: Bentley is unable to help everyone he loves. And defeating evil is more than simply getting rid of an evil person, but also overcoming one's own weaknesses as well. And while Bentley is the conflicted hero, the story also involves several subplots: Straitlaced Mrs. Tally and the much-maligned pretty girl Polly Woodhouse, the widowed, always-sad Mr. Ellicott and Slally's mother Ellen; McGraw, the embittered police chief who unknowingly combats Ombra's influence and questions his lack of faith; Slally, the lonely little girl who comes out of her shell for Bentley; Doctor Kreistein, the Merlin to Bentley's Arthur, who remembers Ombra's influence during World War II and is determined to help his charge.<br />It's also quite pleasant that rather than outright scares and cartoonish badness, Ombra's influence is quite realistic and all the more chilling. He enhances rage and negative emotions in even the nicest, most well-meaning of people. And people who are already rotten at heart willingly become his pawns, a disturbing and realistic portrayal of evil.<br />This book is more suited to young adults than to younger children, as there is some profanity (nothing too obscene), a tastefully-written but very disturbing scene of attempted child molestation, and a few sexual references (also discreet), and a truly horrifying scene with an insane pastor. Additionally, younger children may be confused by Bentley's confrontations with Ombra, and not catch on to the deeper undertones of this book. Fans of mythology  will have a heyday with the variety of obscure hero stories from various cultures, and those who enjoy good writing will like the evocative, detailed language interspersed with small-town atmosphere.<br />However, teen or adult fantasy/horror fans will undoubtledly give \\"Prince Ombra\\" a permanent place on their shelves.

Now there is a prequel to that work \\"I Am Morgan Le Fey,\\" a haunting story of a young girl's gradual downhill stumble.<br />Morgan's father died the night she saw a strange man going off with her mother Igraine. That man, the king, soon took Igraine to be his queen, and her little daughters went to live with the nurse Ongwynn. During that time, Morgan falls in love with Ongwynn's doomed son Thomas, and learns of her own blossoming magical powers.<br />But things take a nasty turn when she is a teenager. Armed with a druid stone and the aid of gods and fay, she goes on a quest to find her traumatized mother in Avalon. But losses and rejection will spur her on to a destiny that she was desperate to avoid...<br />Like its sequel, \\"Morgan\\" is ultimately a psychological work. Springer avoids \\"it wasn't his/her fault\\" traps, instead focusing on explaining rather than excusing. The romance is bittersweet and well-written, which makes the violence and darker undercurrents even more disturbing. And though Morgan's glimpses of the future, we also see a few facets of what we also saw in \\"I Am Mordred\\" -- Morgan as she would be about twenty or thirty years in the future, and what she would do to her family.<br />The main difficulty with the book is that in places it feels a little distended, as if the plot is being scraped a bit too thin. The writing is lush and detailed, with different atmosphere for different settings: Dreamy for Avalon, woodsy and homelike for Ongwynn's cottage, and dangerous for any of the roads.<br />Morgan is a genuinely compelling anti-heroine, who will have readers wishing that her path were anything else. Thomas will win over readers as well, a quiet character who lacks Morgan's darkness. Igraine and Morgause may annoy the readers, and Ongwynn will interest as the surrogate grandmother figure. The other characters are pretty undeveloped, especially the villain.<br />Definitely a good read for fans of good spins on Arthuriana, and definitely for fans of Morgan le Fay (I would recommend this highly over any other Morgan-related book).ecially the villain.<br />Definitely a good read for fans of good spins on Arthuriana, and definitely for fans of Morgan le Fay (I would recommend this highly over any other Morgan-related book).	2002-08-20

Imagine if you actually were.<br /><br />Such is the situation for Jason Miller and his friends in \\"The Dark Side of Nowhere,\\" a tense sci-fi novel by Neal Shusterman. As he gradually unrolls the aliens-living-among-us plot, Shusterman also deftly builds up the surreal sense that the everyday world is just a friendly cover for the eerie reality. It's definitely a great read.<br /><br />To Jason Miller, the town of Billington is incredibly dull.  The only lull in his Norman Rockwell lifestyle is the sudden, violent death of his friend Ethan by appendicitis. But after that, things began to seem strange: The new girl Paula points out that not everyone in the world receives special allergy shots, Jason finds a picture of a classmate from the 1970s, and a sinister janitor gives Jason and the other kids \\"training gloves\\" that shoot BBs like bullets.<br /><br />Then Jason's parents reveal the stranger-than-fiction truth to him: They, and the families they are close to, are all alien beings stranded on Earth.<br /><br />Now the janitor Grant says that alien ships are coming to conquer Earth, and strange changes are taking place in the bodies of the alien-human teens. Jason and his friends must learn more about the terrifying and beautiful alien beings that are their own species, and how to stop Earth from being threatened.<br /><br />It's the dream of every small-town boy who felt that his life is too incredibly dull to be believed, and that \\"you'll live nice, die nice, and your life will have been a nice waste of time.\\" It may not be every boy's dream to find out he and everyone he knows is an alien, but Shusterman manages to make it enthralling.<br /><br />And his writing blends the everyday (burgers, breakfast, baseball, and a father who always calls Jason \\"son\\") and the strange (such as the scene with a certain transfigured character, or when the kids discover their body hair falling off). And he creates a sense of haunting, almost invasive tension that slowly curls away the sunshiny Norman Rockwell exterior.<br /><br />And Jason is a pretty good hero -- at first he seems mainly interested in being sarcastic and cocky so he can break out of his dull life, but when a real crisis arises he shows his intelligent, resourceful side. Paula is pretty good as the human girl he has a sneaking liking for, and Grant is creepy and very believably alien.

His entertaining, original and thought-provoking fantasy \\"The High House\\" harkens back to fantasy writers like Dunsany and MacDonald, with the tang of a long-lost era of literature.<br />The High House of Evenmere is not like any other house in the world: It, in essence, controls the universe as the clocks in it represent parts of ordered reality. There is a dinosaur in the attic, man-eating furniture-shaped beasties in the basement, magical speaking tigers, a room of unspeakable horrors, and a six-thousand-year-old servant from Biblical times who spoke and walked with God. Each room is a world. But young Carter Anderson only sees a few of these before he is sent away from Evenmere, leaving behind his father, his poisonous stepmother Lady Murmur, and his infant stepbrother Duskin.<br />Years later, upon the disappearance of his father and his supposed death, Carter returns to Evermere as its new Steward. Despite Murmur's treacherous presence, he learns more about the supernatural anarchists who are seeking to destroy the order of the universe -- by taking over Evermere and disrupting it. To oppose them, Carter must try to find the Tawny Mantle, the Lightning Sword, the Keys, and learn the Seven Words. But will it be enough, as Order, Chaos, and the malevolent anarchists circle around the new Steward?<br />Stoddard's book is an interesting blend: His prose is as rich and lush as older books, with modern editing, pacing and connectability to the readers. It's slightly dense, but never hard to read or difficult to get into. Most captivating of all are the descriptions of the interior of the High House -- there is no real map that a person can imagine, but a place where rooms can lead to secret corridors that can lead to anything from a chamber of horrors to an underground river. You can't tell what is in all the rooms, or whether it will be the same or contain the same people. And descriptions of talking tigers, an attic dinosaur, and man-eating furniture that talks like Gollum could have easily been ridiculous. Instead they inspire chills.<br />The idea of Evenmere is as good as it gets. The house is a surreal experience in itself, a character in its own right, with a subtle feeling of anything-can-happen. Stoddard never makes it entirely clear if the people in it are existing in our world, or in a parallel universe where one can casually talk about hunting with tigers in Naleewuath. There is also some religious significance, as Evenmere is \\"His [God's] mechanism. He uses it to run the universe...\\" through the Steward. Stoddard introduces some intricate philosophy about Order and Chaos (who are represented as a little girl and an old man), good and evil, and the balance of the universe.<br />The characterizations are just as good. With very little effort, Stoddard can make readers like or dislike his characters. Carter's quiet good nature, personal vulnerabilities and curiosity make him a likeable protagonist, as is Hope, the eager lawyer friend, and Enoch, the six-thousand-year-old servant who accompanies Carter. Lord Anderson (what little we see of him) comes across as noble and likeable, though fallible; Lady Murmur is repellent in her power-hunger, while her son Duskin starts off as a teenage brat but is gradually revealed to be a kinder, pleasanter person.<br />When reading this book, one can almost imagine Stoddard sitting in a smoky room with Tolkien and Lewis, discussing philosophy.

There is also some religious significance, as Evenmere is \\"His [God's] mechanism. He uses it to run the universe...\\" through the Steward. Stoddard introduces some intricate philosophy about Order and Chaos (who are represented as a little girl and an old man), good and evil, and the balance of the universe.<br />The characterizations are just as good. With very little effort, Stoddard can make readers like or dislike his characters. Carter's quiet good nature, personal vulnerabilities and curiosity make him a likeable protagonist, as is Hope, the eager lawyer friend, and Enoch, the six-thousand-year-old servant who accompanies Carter. Lord Anderson (what little we see of him) comes across as noble and likeable, though fallible; Lady Murmur is repellent in her power-hunger, while her son Duskin starts off as a teenage brat but is gradually revealed to be a kinder, pleasanter person.<br />When reading this book, one can almost imagine Stoddard sitting in a smoky room with Tolkien and Lewis, discussing philosophy. This book is a little-known treasure, a read for people of all ages.	2002-08-16

Shockingly dull	Self-aware teen writer Nick McDonell's novel \\"Twelve\\" burst into the literary market in a spray of irrelevent hype earlier this year. With a painfully two-dimensional cast and a fragmented non-storyline, \\"Twelve\\" is not shocking, just shockingly dull.<br />White Mike is a dropout drug dealer whose father ignores him and whose mother is dead of breast cancer. Hardly different from the spoiled rich kids he deals to, whose parents leave them on vacations and business, and ignore the resulting hedonism that they indulge in. Then there is Jessica, an addict of the drug Twelve, the creepy Lionel, unfortunate Hunter, \\"hottest girl\\" Sara, and numerous others. Murder, sex, drugs, and misery culminate in a violent New Year's Eve.<br />There isn't much of a plot to \\"Twelve.\\" Several vaguely-connected characters drift in and out of various situations -- some of them connected to the vaguely-defined plot, some not. The actual text of the novel is very short. All the chapters are only a few pages long, and the shortest is one line long; the type is unusually large to expand this to a normal adult-novel length. The prose is stark and sparse to the point of being nonexistant. Hardly anything is described, beyond a description of blonde hair or rock-hard muscles, a smell or a spoon; it reads more like a screenplay, without the order and careful writing. The grand finale will annoy rather than shock, as McDonell seems to have no idea what to do with his plotlines.<br />And McDonell, precocious little man that he is, has also abandoned the basic rules of punctuation and grammar, making mistakes that I stopped making at the age of twelve. In the first two pages of White Mike's ponderings, his name is used in almost every sentence (\\"White Mike thought this. White Mike saw that\\"). In a chapter later in the book, almost every sentence begins with \\"He.\\" And on page five, one of the sentences contains the word \\"and\\" eight times. The frequent run-on-sentences will cause even hardened readers to blink and squint. The dialogue is surreal: The characters seem to talk at random, zipping from one irrelevent topic to the next like gas molecules.<br />Those characters don't have much life to them. There is some effort in making us like White Mike, by giving us short, stark flashbacks to his life prior to and just after his mother's death. But every time the reader starts getting into Mike's head, we are jerked away to focus on one of the insipid teenagers who mope around New York, and their everyday decisions like where to get a haircut.<br />And like many young writers who shoot to stardom, McDonell is relentlessly aware of himself. Like his fellow teen writers Anselm Audley and Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, he sets out (one way or another) to prove how mature he is. He does this with randomly-applied profanity, graphic violence, and gratuitous sexual content. Worst of all, he uses none of these elements to further his sketchy plot. While the idea of Jessica trading sexual favors for the drug Twelve has promise, McDonell doesn't use it to evoke any emotions in the readers. Nor does he use the admittedly poignant flashbacks of White Mike's mother and her death, or the violent finale.<br />This is the sort of book that can only be published if one's godfather is a publisher -- a dull, poorly-written, pretentious excuse for a novel.

Themes such as humility, friendship, knowing that good and evil are not packaged obviously, the nature of evil, and so on are explored.<br />The Lord of the Rings, the foremost and best fantasy work, is not a religious book the way we think of it. However, as Tolkien was a devout Catholic, it would have been nearly impossible for him to not frame the heroes of Middle-Earth in his beliefs. Themes about temptation, redemption, punishment, good and evil, and theology are included in his created universe. However, as I am glad the authors acknowledged, Tolkien disliked parables and would never have made those beliefs blatant. Rather they were elements of morality, and actions that the heroes took.<br />Several of their chapters are quite nice and even thought-provoking. Some of them, such as \\"Shutting Out The Night\\" and \\"The Last Homely House,\\" get a little sidetracked and start to sound slightly strained. And many of the lessons are pretty basic and bland, skimming the surface but never going into the deeper implications of morality and the impact of religion upon the book. But the writing style is breezy and the authors never get too tangled in their own words and theories. And they never become enmeshed in psychological speculation (either about Tolkien or the characters) or irrelevant New Age stuff.<br />There are some annoying flaws. For one thing, it is \\"Elven,\\" not \\"Elvin.\\" Second, the authors sidestep several faith-related points in the book, due to the fact that they directly reflected Tolkien's Roman Catholic faith. When talking about Christianity's influence on \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" not talking about Tolkien being a Catholic is like talking about Legolas but neglecting to mention that he is an Elf. There are various other errors, which while they do not undermine the messages in the book, are more than a little distracting.<br />It's a nice but ultimately lightweight look at \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the moral and religious overtones present in it.

1442261:US	50881246	R335M9P0QWHNS1	0380809060	394892878	The Great Book of Amber: The Complete Amber Chronicles, 1-10 (Chronicles of Amber)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	To the world of Amber	Robert Zelazny's Amber Chronicles are rightly considered a classic series, with a cult following and a unique, quirky style that sets it apart from most SF/F stories. With two main protagonists and two interlocked storylines, set in a Machiavellian universe known as Amber, this is a complex, pulse-pounding adventure series.<br />The first five books tell the story of Corwin, who is first introduced to readers as an amnesiac who escapes a hospital (a crude but effective tactic of introducing readers to Amber, as Corwin is reintroduced to it). He soon becomes reenmeshed in a complex power struggle with his devious siblings, to determine who will rule Amber. The second five books focus on Corwin's son Merlin, who is nearly killed on the same day every year. He is subsequently sucked into the same power struggles as his father...<br />It's a credit to Zelazny's skill that he was able to produce such evocative images with such stark prose. With a few exceptions, such as the first transition into Amber, he usually kept his descriptions minimal, and after describing a given character, building, creature, or landmark he would not do so again. He showed a similar skill for his characterizations. Readers will like Corwin's snappy persona and Merlin's more thoughtful manner, as well as the multilayered, mysterious personalities of their friends, relatives and allies. And the concept of Amber itself is excellent: The one true world upon which all others are shadows, based upon the Pattern.<br />Zelazny's books are not flawless. Corwin and Merlin often seem to escape by the seat of their pants by improbable deus ex machinae, and some of the supporting characters are left rather underdeveloped. He also seemed slightly besotted by the tarot cards, and the transitions from one world to another, as these passages are repeated over and over. Teens will undoubtedly enjoy these books, given the spicy narrative and settings; but children should not read these books, due to some sexual content (not too graphic, but quite obvious) and some very alarming sibling relationships.<br />Unfortunately the ten-in-one edition is unsatisfactory in some ways. While it is admittedly hard to produce a 1200-page book without some flaws, this has too many to be excused. The paper quality is very cheap, as is the too-breakable binding. If you are the type to abuse or at least be casual with your books, you would do better to find the older, individual, out of print paperbacks.<br />\\"The Great Book of Amber\\" is a good read for readers who enjoy original, highly complex stories, full of delightfully fantastical worlds and anti-heroes.

Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit,\\" people have imagined wizards as tall, elderly men with long gray beards, loose robes and pointed hats. Diana Wynne-Jones shatters the cliched image with Chrestomanci, a dapper Englishman who happens to be the nine-lived magician in charge of all the magic -- in all the parallel worlds.<br />\\"Charmed Life\\" is the story of Cat and Gwendolen, siblings who are orphaned in a tragic steamboat accident. While Cat is shy, Gwendolen is the opposite: She is an unnaturally powerful witch, and intends to rise high enough to rule the world. She thinks that she's got it made when Chrestomanci brings her and her brother to his castle. But Gwendolen has met her match in Chrestomanci -- and a magical war of wills has begun!<br />\\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" is the backstory of Chrestomanci. Once he was an ordinary boy, whose ambition was to become a cricket player. But when he is tested by a powerful magician, Christopher Chant is found to be Chrestomanci: An amazingly powerful magician with not one, but NINE lives. The problem is, Christopher doesn't want to be Chrestomanci -- and he's already enmeshed in a wizards' smuggling ring that may spell doom for his new friends...<br />Diana Wynne-Jones is at her best here: the books are funny, dramatic, well-characterized, well-written and well-plotted. The parallel worlds are well-thought out, such as Chrestomanci's world, where magic exists rather than science as we know it. As in many of her books, she shows unusual insights into the thought processes of both young and adolescent children. While readers may sometimes want to smack the lead characters, it's hard not to like the heroes and despise the villains.<br />After reading this two-pack, readers should immediately read the next two books in the series, as well as the new short-story collection. Chrestomanci is too good to be missed.	2002-08-11

Bradbury manages to use evocative language and charming characters to draw the readers into what is almost a parallel world.<br />Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade are boys born two seconds apart -- one on Halloween, the other on the day before. Will is the ultimate innocent, while Jim is darker and more knowledgeable about the world. These two have been inseparable friends all their lives, despite their different personalities and tiny events that divide them on subtle levels. Then, one day, a strange carnival comes to their town, with a freak show and a carousel.<br />But a more sinister undercurrent runs in this carnival: The freak show, with its tattooed \\"illustrated man,\\" blind gypsy witch, and murderous dwarf, is more menacing than the townspeople expect. And when Will and Jim see the carousel change a man's age, they become the targets of Mr. Dark and his evil cohorts -- for fates worse than death.<br />Bradbury's writing is a mixed bag. While it's extremely evocative and often surreal, it becomes a little clumsy at times. He refers to the carousel horses having \\"panic-colored teeth,\\" but never explains what this description means. His metaphors occasionally become very strained, and at times the lapses into philosophical musings become distractions to the overall plotline.<br />However, he expertly draws out a feeling of horror with only a few words, never overdoing the descriptions of something that terrifies Jim and Will. Rather than using \\"ghoulies and ghosties,\\" Bradbury plays on fears in every human being, such as fears of aging, loneliness, physical decrepitude, loss of loved ones, and most horrifyingly when people are aged or de-aged and thus unrecognizable to their friends and loved ones. The buildup of suspense as the boys hide from Dark and his lackeys is utterly terrifying. And in a masterful use of nostalgia, Bradbury brings readers to the midwestern America of his youth, an innocent place of screen doors, fall leaves and barber shops.<br />Jim and Will are good foils for one another. Too often in books with two lead characters of the same age and background, there is no personality difference, but these boys are radically different. Will is an utter innocent, with no comprehension of the seductiveness of evil and a great deal of fear for his family and his best friend. Jim, on the other hand, is more susceptible to Mr. Dark's offers. He wants to age to the level of a young adult with the carousel, while knowing in his heart that nothing good can come of it; his temptation is frightening in its intensity. The temptation is reversed for the quiet Charles Holloway, who is haunted by his own age and the relative youth of his son. His gradual changes of thought on this matter are never clumsy or sappy, but rather with the brilliance of Charles' new perceptions.<br />\\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is one of the rare stories that blends unusual prose, good characterizations, and skilful atmosphere into a true spinechiller. A great horror classic.

Hoover's \\"Orvis\\" helps fill that gaping vacancy -- charming, smart, without being too technically-obsessed.<br />Toby is the daughter of a pair of self-absorbed actors who are too busy to be with her, and lives at the Academy under the thumb of her domineering grandmother. One day she meets someone like her: A four-hundred-year-old, very sardonic, very ugly robot called ORVIS, survivor of several of his masters and now ordered to scrap himself at a local junkyard. After a few talks with Toby and her best friend, lonely rich kid Thaddeus, Orvis comes to stay with Toby.<br />But the teachers at the Academy don't want Orvis around: He's a very old model, capable of thinking for himself and making his own choices and decisions, and so they deem him \\"dangerous.\\" They attempt to scrap him again. But Toby has had enough, having received the news that her grandmother wants her to go to school on Mars. She, Thaddeus and Orvis set off towards her great-grandmother's isolated home, but are hijacked by criminals. The three of them are left stranded in the wasteland between cities known as the Empty.<br />\\"Orvis\\" is an entertaining book, with a small, tight cast and a good storyline. The future world of \\"Orvis\\" is pretty similar in most ways to our world, technically advanced but in essentials very much like modern-day Earth. The biggest differences are in the layout of the future Earth, which has isolated, luxurious cities surrounded by lawless wastelands, and in the robots, most of which are intelligent but utterly docile. The book falls down in a few areas: the descriptions are a little too stark, and I felt that the insensitive decision to send Toby to Mars would have been more effective if we had SEEN her grandmother telling her.<br />Toby is a sympathetic character to any kid who has felt ignored by his/her parents, or a loner at a school full of cliques. Thaddeus is a little overshadowed by Toby, and never is as well-developed or inidividualized, but he's a nice sidekick as well.

Funny, quirky, with an ingrained lesson and snappier writing, this tops the previous book and promises more to come.<br />Johnny Maxwell sees dead people. (Yes, like the little boy in \\"Sixth Sense.\\") For whatever reason, he sees the dead in their graveyard -- not really ghosts, but not alive either. Among them are a crabby former soldier, a distant relative of Einstein, a sprightly suffragette who died in a freak mishap, and a staunch Communist who STILL doesn't believe in life after death. All in all, they are a fairly harmless bunch.<br />But a massive, mercenary, progress-obsessed corporation has just bought the graveyard for fivepence, and it will soon be razed for new construction. The only people more dismayed than the living inhabitants of Blackbury are the dead ones. So as the dead break their bonds to \\"uvlive,\\" Johnny and his friends will try to save the graveyard from... a fate worse than death?<br />This book is not only more entertaining and humorous than \\"Mankind,\\" but it is also more polished. Pratchett's style becomes more flowing and easy, and the message he puts in it is not ham-handed or badly-written. It's also extremely light and entertaining most of the time, such as when the dead Communist calls up a radio talk show host and speaks frankly about being \\"vertically challenged.\\"<br />Johnny is thoughtful and intelligent, quiet until he has a reason to speak out. His buddies Wobbler, Yo-less and Bigmac also return, with their individual personalities even more individualized: Wobbler is a little odd (wants to see a goat sacrificed), Yo-less is intellectual and more on Johnny's level, and Bigmac loves food.

Though it drags in places and occasionally becomes a little too precious, it nevertheless is a one-of-a-kind adventure.<br />Pidge wanders into a used bookstore, and finds a strange book in the back. An odd old man gives it to him as a gift -- and soon strange things begin to happen. A powerful and malevolent serpent, Olc-Glas, is confined in the book, and soon an enormous talking eel surfaces to restrain it. His father purchases a strange unearthly horse. And a pair of ebullient, sinister women move into a nearby house. Breda Fairfowl and Melanie Moonlight are really two aspects of the war-goddess Morrigan, and they have designs to get Olc-Glas for their own power.<br />Pidge and his sister Brigit are under the protection of the Good God Dagda. But they are also being pursued by the hideous Hounds. In an effort to save the world, they set off on an epic time-and-space quest to find one of the stones that can help defeat the Morrigan.<br />O'Shea's narrative has a charm that pervades every page. With her whimsical use of animals, gods, druids, and the obviously-beloved Eire itself, she creates a mysterical atmosphere. Though the setting starts in contemporary Ireland, the feeling that anything can happen is well-established from the first chapter onward. This only increases as readers move forward. By the middle of the book, a mad Napoleonic earwig with a cute little buggy army seems perfectly normal. A knitting spider, an unfortunate little frog, a looks-conscious ogre, and the aforementioned Napoleonic earwig and one of his less-than-fearless followers appear in this book. The more mysterious and awe-inspiring elements show up as well: Aengus Og and his handcuffs made of daisies, the Dagda, the giant eel, the ancient druid Cathbad, and the mythical hero Cuchulainn. The climax is outstandingly written, a battle between the good guys and bad guys in which no shots are called and they all stand in their full glory.<br />However, these speaking animals are merely side characters. Pidge and Brigit are the quintessential fantasy kids who get swept up in magical doings: Pidge is, as it is observed in the book, a quiet but intelligent boy who sees more than others do; Brigit makes up for her lack of observance with innocent bravery and guts, occasionally getting through on little-girl niceness where nothing else will do. Breda, Melanie and the Morrigan are all delightfully psychotic, while the Hounds are similarly bad, but one takes actions that will startle the readers. Other suppporting characters flit in and out, but will usually endear themselves to you as well.<br />Descriptions are kept to a minimum, but O'Shea knows when to extend them; one memorable scene is when one of the Hounds appears at Pidge's house in human form. With subtle descriptions, she manages to create more of an atmosphere of horror than can be found in a Stephen King book. However, in the middle of the book Pidge and Brigit's side-trips begin to dominate the storyline too much; though the story gets back on track, it's a little distracting, as if her attention began to wander. Additionally, there are some scenes that are simply a little too cutesy for their own good. And readers had better have good attention spans, or else the 700-page length may lose them on the way.<br />Despite these flaws, \\"Hounds of the Morrigan\\" is a delightful romp through folklore, mythos, and a modern little fantasy world inset in Ireland.

It's an enjoyable short fantasy, with good heroes and an original plotline focusing on betrayal, time-travel, werewolves, and a royal intrigue that sucks in two modern children.<br />John and Margaret are on a family picnic with their parents, who doze off and allow the kids to go wandering in the woods. When they see a man dressed in sumptuous clothes from the Middle-Ages, naturally they are intrigued. As they follow him, they find a golden pendant, the tracks of a wolf, and a ramshackle cottage where the man is sleeping.<br />The man, they find, is a nobleman named Mardian who was betrayed by a sorcerer, in an effort to alienate him from his lord and friend Duke Otho. Mardian was transformed into a werewolf -- man by day, wolf by night -- and is hunted by the Duke's men. Mardian's main goal, however, is to save Otho and his son Crispin from Almeric's plots and sorcery. But he can't go near the castle. So John and Margaret agree to infiltrate the castle and try to defeat Almeric -- a task which proves much more difficult than they had thought.<br />Mary Stewart writes a simply-plotted but enjoyable story, with an interesting storyline and a quick pace. Her third-person writing style makes it a little difficult to get into the heads of the lead characters, but they are still very engaging. Her descriptions of the castle, the forest, and the people around Margaret and John are detailed without being too much so. And her handling of such worn ideas as werewolves and time-travel are deft and cliche-less.<br />Margaret and John are the now-classic British-kids-on-vacation, who stumble onto something strange and get sucked into an adventure. They're moderately smart, a little confused, and quite willing to go along with whatever strange things are going on. Mardian is a quiet, tragic type who is determined to<br />fix the situation in the castle, while Almeric is simply pure evil. Prince Crispin is a good supporter to the two leads, though not quite as interesting as they are.<br />This is an enjoyable fantasy for all ages, with good plotting and a classic pair of lead characters. \\"Walk\\" goes plenty of places, all of them interesting.ure evil.

However, it's an exceptional book for people who have read the Prydain Chronicles and The Dark is Rising sequence, and who are craving more.<br />Since the death of their mother, the three Morgan children have become increasingly divided from their father David. Peter and Becky live with him in an isolated town in Wales, while Jen lives in the United States with her aunt. When Jen arrives on a vacation, she finds David distant and uncommunicative, and Peter sullen and angry. Despite the isolation of the town, Jen tries her hardest to enjoy it, and to keep her family from fragmenting further.<br />Then Peter finds a harp tuning key, and begins getting glimpses of the past -- and of the legendary bard Taliesin. He becomes increasingly drawn to his visions of the past, and even vanishes in an attempt to uncover more about Taliesin. Jen tries to deny that the key is magical, but as Peter falls more and more under the key's spell, the three children must find out what they need to do for it.<br />Bond weaves Welsh mythology and modern-day dilemmas together in a way that very few authors can. On one hand, we have the Morgan kids with their present-day actions -- hanging out with some Welsh friends, seeking a sheep-killer (who turns out to be connected to the key), and Jen trying to learn how to cook. She also does a good job of giving the readers a view of a fast-dying way of life in Wales, though these sections stretch on a little too long. But Bond outdoes herself in the glimpses of the past, in which the language becomes dreamy and evocative. In some areas it becomes reminiscent of Susan Cooper at her finest moments.<br />People who want their fantasy generic, cute and mindless will not like \\"String.\\" Nothing in the Welsh mythos is dumbed down for the audience, and younger kids will probably have difficulty keeping some of the legends straight. However, if readers handled other mythologically-oriented books, they will have no trouble with this one.<br />Peter's desperate attachment to the key is excellently-written, as is his resentment towards his father for stranding him in a tiny Welsh town. Jen and Becky are a little less prominent, as they are not seeing the past, but Jen's unswerving assertions that Peter is lying will annoy readers. David also will initially annoy readers, because of his unwillingness to consider his children's emotions, but becomes more sympathetic toward the end of the book. The Welsh characters, with the exception of the revolting Dr. Owen, don't elicit as much reaction as the American ones, but the character of Taliesin manages to fascinate without even appearing much. He's a pervasive presence throughout the book.<br />Fans of \\"The Dark is Rising\\" and Lloyd Alexander will thoroughly enjoy \\"String in the Harp,\\" a dreamy tale of magic, myth and history.nger kids will probably have difficulty keeping some of the legends straight.

For reasons too complex to summarize, the Maris clans require an outsider to choose their Keeper, who helps protect them from the savage Zebak warriors. Jiller is the latest in a long line of Choosers, and Rowan will be her successor.<br />But upon arriving at the Cavern, Jiller is mysteriously poisoned. But after Rowan is appointed the new Chooser, he refuses to choose any of the three candidates until they help him find the ingredients for the antidote. The three set off on their quest -- but Rowan begins to wonder which of the three poisoned Jiller, and what motives are behind it.<br />As in the previous two books, Emily Rodda creates a believable world without the usual fantasy trappings like elves and wizards. The mystery surrounding Jiller's poisoning and the question of who would be chosen to be Keeper -- and why -- remains a question until the penultimate chapter, and events near them hint at the fourth book. The writing is beautifully descriptive without being too much so, and the dialogue is growing more realistic with every new book.<br />Rowan shows some personal growth since the first book, where he was outstandingly timid; here he is more self-assertive and confident, even when surrounded by strangers, and even defies the Keeper in an effort to save his mother. Jiller and Jonn (now formally engaged) are fairly nebulous. The three candidates are sufficiently defined that they don't blend together, especially Doss, who has a secret; Seaborn, who inexplicably doesn't like being a candidate; and Asha, who adheres viciously to how she thinks the world should work.<br />\\"Keeper of the Crystal\\" is an excellent young kids' fantasy, something for them either to read themselves or be read to at bedtime. Excellent second sequel.how she thinks the world should work.<br />\\"Keeper of the Crystal\\" is an excellent young kids' fantasy, something for them either to read themselves or be read to at bedtime.

With the advent of the epic movie trilogy based on this book, new waves of readers are discovering the unique power of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It has quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it, and helped spawn such entertainment phenomena as \\"Star Wars.\\"<br />Following up on events in \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" stars the quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his friend, Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that he has learned something: The Ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. Aghast, Frodo joins a fellowship of Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Men and a wizard, to go to the one place where the Ring can be destroyed.<br />\\"The Two Towers\\" begins directly after \\"Fellowship,\\" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam, and his cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs of the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised.<br />\\"Return of the King\\" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.<br />\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed a powerful book, speaking to virtually everyone. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien drew on his experiences in World War I, the ravaged battlefields, and the mechanization of the countryside for the most moving passages of the book. His beliefs beliefs are equally misty but present: they fueled the ethics of the good guys, the fall of formerly-good wizard Saruman, and the themes of temptation, redemption, evil and good that run through every character.<br />Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of how he is influenced by the Ring. Sam Gamgee is his loyal gardener, a shy young hobbit who grows in confidence and courage over the course of the trilogy. Gandalf is the quintessential wizard -- crabby, kindly, powerful, with a hidden unique streak that elevates him over the usual Obi-Wan Kenobi wizards. Merry and Pippin start out as a chirpy boy and a well-meaning flake, but are matured and made more multi-dimensional by their harrowing experiences. Aragorn is noble, kind, kingly, and intelligent, but with darker streaks in his personality that make him ultimately human. Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf initially grate on each other, but overcome their prejudices to become close friends.<br />Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue ranges from absolutely hilarious to solemn and biblical, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary; if you don't have a good attention span, then you won't be able to handle this story.<br />Even after all the years, \\"Lord\\" still rules the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and noone book has even come close to equalling it.one book has even come close to equalling it.	2002-07-26

When Jack befriends new-girl Carlin, Mr. Bough asks him to take care of the smelly house for a few days. When the two of them go in, they find a very odd interior with crystals, enormous books, bottles full of strange substances -- and no electricity or modern devices.<br />But things begin to go awry when Carlin brings in her laptop. A magical vortex opens inside the computer, allowing a malevolent mischief-maker named Puck to possess Jack's body, leaving Jack inside electrical appliances. Carlin barely escapes with the disembodied Jack and her magicked computer -- but Puck follows her wherever she goes. The two kids must try to find the mysterious Mr. Bough before Puck can put his plans into action...<br />\\"Misspellers\\" manages to pull off something I hadn't really seen done successfully before, the handling of magic and modern technology in the same plotline. Other books such as \\"Pure Dead Magic\\" have touched on it, but very few have centered on such a plot. The idea of a disembodied person moving from car to watch to cell phone may seem initially silly, but Martineck pulls it off with rare believability. He has an excellent sense of atmosphere, evoking the initially pleasant and dull Strawberry Island, the weirdness of Bough's smelly house, and the chilling suspense of having Puck potentially popping up at every corner.<br />The dialogue is snappy and realistic; though Carlin and Jack bicker and disagree occasionally, it never becomes tiresome as bickering is in many books. First and foremost, they are friends, and very realistic ones at that. Descriptions are good, evocative and lightly detailed so as not to bog down the fast-moving plot. Especially entertaining are Jack's thoughts on being a car and a speedboat -- it's very funny how he responds. And the magical system that Martineck creates in this book (one that doesn't get along well with technology) is highly original and has some very original twists in it. (Just wait till you see what he says about the Pentagon) On a quality basis, the book is also well made: The binding is tight and the paper is thick and smooth.<br />The cast is small but well-defined. Jack and Carlin are introduced with thoughts that readers will sympathize with: Carlin's feeling that she is unimportant to her family, and Jack's dissastisfaction with being the \\"hand-me-down\\" brother. Both are strong and interesting characters, and it takes a lot of guts to have one of the leads spending his time in cell phones and watches, but Martineck pulls it off. Mr. Bough is mysterious and likeable; Puck (\\"Loki, Anase, the Trickster...\\") is nasty in a chillingly cheerful sort of way, with his rhyming, offhand threats.<br />Fans of Diana Wynne-Jones and Emily Drake will undoubtedly love \\"Misspellers,\\" with the excellent characterizations and highly original magic.

Bran's only friend is the silver-eyed dog Cafall.<br />Will acquaints his new friend with more information about the battle with the Dark, while Bran acquaints him with information about Wales that can help Will find the golden harp, and wake the Sleepers under the hill. But the malevolent Grey King is spying on them with magical warestones and trying to wrest the harp from Will. To stop the Grey King, Will must learn the secret of Bran's past and evade the dangerous farmer Caradog Pritchard...<br />Atmosphere is thick and enticing in \\"Grey King\\" -- Cooper has clearly come a long way from the fluffier \\"Over Sea Under Stone.\\" This book, unlike \\"Greenwitch,\\" does not handle the Drew family, or even much about Merriman: it's all about Bran and Will, who are given equal parts of the plotline. Though there are many other characters, these two are the core of the story.<br />Here the Arthurian theme, which has been present in a smaller way throughout the series, becomes more pronounced and integral. Cooper continues interweaving mythic elements into it, such as the Sleepers, Cafall the dog, and the Brenin Llwyd. Fans of mythology and other mythic-themed stories such as the Prydain Chronicles will have a heyday.<br />Will is very much like he is in \\"Greenwitch\\" -- sometimes he's an ordinary preteen boy who starts yelling \\"Achtung!\\" at the top of his lungs, and sometimes he is the wise and ancient Old One, with knowledge he learned from the book of Gramarye. Bran is an instantly sympathetic character, a very ordinary boy with an extraordinay past; he, like Will in the second book, gradually grows into a unique and more powerful person. Caradog Pritchard will inspire disgust from his first appearance onward, while the tragic Owen Davies will gain the sympathy of the readers despite his insulated life.<br />Perhaps the worst thing about reading \\"Grey King\\" is the knowledge that there is only one more book in this series.

But there is a dark side to this existance: The Tripods \\"cap\\" every human being with a mechanical brain implant, making them docile, happy, and easily controlled. The adults, who treat this as a rite of passage, are all unable to question the Tripods.<br />But the teenage Will and his cousin Henry have not yet been capped, and so their minds are still their own. After a relative loses his suspicions about the Tripods during his capping ceremony, the boys are more suspicious still. And then a seemingly mad vagrant reveals that he is also free of the Tripods -- and that there are others like him. The boys set off on a harrowing journey to a distant place where they can fight the Tripods.<br />It's a fairly simple plot, being only the first of three interconnected books (there's also a prequel). \\"White Mountains\\" sets up the next two books, while establishing an interesting SF plot. Christopher is very effective in gradually increasing the feeling of fear and paranoia over the course of the story; the surroundings of this future England are familiar enough that very little explanation is needed about the surroudnings.<br />Will and Henry are essentially ordinary young boys in extraordinary circumstances. They don't fit into the idyllic Tripod-dominated world because they aren't mindless drones yet; their determination to remain free is very real and well-written. The vagrant, Ozymandias (an apt name), is a brief but intense presence; the other characters are rather flat and lifeless because of their lack of free will.<br />The only problem with the book is that the narrative style is too slow in some sections, and very dry throughout it. We hear what the heroes think, but very rarely FEEL it. Dialogue is fairly realistic, at its strongest when the vagrant explains to the hero just what happened in the past. Gradually throughout the story, Christopher establishes a subtle message on blind obedience and subservience, and how detrimental it is to the human soul and freedoms.<br />Readers should keep the other volumes of this series beside them as they read \\"White Mountains,\\" because the book ends with a glaring \\"To Be Continued\\" sign. It's an entertaining and suspenseful SF story that will entertain kids and adults alike.oo slow in some sections, and very dry throughout it. We hear what the heroes think, but very rarely FEEL it.

One of those is &quot;Only You Can Save Mankind,&quot; the first book of a young adult trilogy, which shows some of his initial roughness but is still convincing and enjoyable.<br />Johnny Maxwell is an extremely smart but otherwise ordinary English boy, who enjoys hanging out with his friends Wobbler, Yo-less, and Bigmac (their respective nicknames are all explained in the book) and exchanging pirated video games. One of these, &quot;Only You Can Save Mankind,&quot; focuses on defeating reptilian aliens called ScreeWees.<br />But suddenly the ScreeWees surrender. Johnny is, unsurprisingly, quite taken aback: video game enemies are supposed to continue fighting, not surrender and ask him to stop firing. Then the game shows nothing but empty space. Johnny assumes that there is something odd about it, but nothing can prepare him for what it turns out to be: The ScreeWees are real aliens, who are attacked when someone uses the video game.<br />Though very different from his Discworld series, &quot;Only You Can Save Mankind&quot; has the stamp of a Terry Pratchett book. From the quiet hero who sees it all, to supporting characters called &quot;Wobbler,&quot; it's all Pratchett. The conversations are Pratchett's usual slightly rambling, nuggets-of-wisdom dialogue. The narrative style is much rougher and starker than in this later books, without the polish to be found in his later books. However, he also adds in some swsssh and fplatfplatfplat sound effects whenever the video game is dealt with.<br />The ScreeWees are interesting and original, although I hope Mr. Pratchett has since learned that amphibians do not have scales. The humor is very unique and original, such as when the Captain tells Johnny to order Jumboburgers for an entire spacefleet, or the long-running Sigourney Weaver joke. On the other hand, he also provides some intelligent questions that are left for the reader to ponder, and an enjoyably whimsical plot: &quot;What if video games were real acts of war?&quot;<br />Johnny is an endearing hero in the mold of Pratchett's Discworld character Teppic, a young and slightly naive young boy with a quick brain and a very difficult situation. His supporters Kristy, Wobbler, Yo-less and Bigmac are all set apart by individual quirks like Wobbler's endearing lack of ethics, Yo-less's conscientous attitude, and Bigmac's appetite. The Captain doesn't appear much, but she is tough and easy to sympathize with.<br />Though hard to find in the United States, the Johnny Maxwell trilogy is well worth the read, especially for Pratchett fans.hat are left for the reader to ponder, and an enjoyably whimsical plot: &quot;What if video games were real acts of war?&quot;<br />Johnny is an endearing hero in the mold of Pratchett's Discworld character Teppic, a young and slightly naive young boy with a quick brain and a very difficult situation.

A little too tight in places, but never quite becoming irritating. Mediocre Diana Wynne-Jones is still exceptional.<br />Abdullah is a dreamy young carpet merchant with a slew of nosy, overbearing relatives and a prophecy made at his birth; they see him as wasting his life, which is quite humble to say the least. But his fortunes change when he is sold a magic carpet by a mysterious stranger. The carpet takes him as he sleeps to a secluded garden, where a naive, beautiful young woman called Flower-in-the-Night is. Unsurprisingly, Abdullah and Flower-in-the-Night fall deeply in love. Unfortunately, her rich father wants to marry her off to a prince.<br />Abdullah tries to elope with Flower-in-the-Night, only to see her carried off by a hideous djinn. He ends up on the run from her father with a mercenary soldier, the flattery-hungry carpet, a malicious genie who makes every wish go wrong somehow, and a mother cat and her kitten. Soon they end up enmeshed in a bizarre tangle involving wizards, djinns, demons, genies, dogs smelling of squid, and a slew of princesses with minds of their own.<br />Though this is a sequel to \\"Howl's Moving Castle,\\" the characters from that book take over half the book to show up. Instead, we are treated to Wynne-Jones' entertainingly skewed version of the \\"Arabian Nights,\\" with the hapless and sweet-spoken Abdullah slogging to the castle. Jones manages to affectionately poke the Middle-Eastern setting and its various customs, while spinning the story outward to encompass \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" as well. Her humor is especially present here, with the revolt of the many princesses, Flower-in-the-Night insisting that Abdullah is a woman, the ultra-sensible Princess Beatrice, Abdullah's constant gushing over the carpet, Abdullah's intended brides, and many other amusing items.<br />Abdullah is the Everyman hero, who simply wants to marry a princess and live a life of luxury; evidently he never expected to have to work so hard for it. The genie is crabbily endearing, especially when one considers that he will try to turn every wish against the one who makes it. The unnamed soldier is a gruff Han Solo character with a weak spot for cats. Flower-in-the-Night is a great heroine: despite her initial naivete, she has a quick brain and the ability to cow even a demon. And as you read this, remember that no one in it is quite who they appear.<br />What are the problems? Well, the extended sequence with the soldier and Abdullah caring for the cats is rather dull in places. Also, the ending is just a little too neat and happy. While I don't like dangling threads that are simply left, it seemed like every thread was tightly wrapped up at the expense of realism.<br />However, \\"Castle\\" is an amusing and endearing read.

Jane Yolen deftly avoids those traps in a collection of poems and stories that is never gruesome, never sappy, and never really scary.<br />\\"It Was the Hour\\" is a poem about the brief appearance of a ghost. \\"Ghost Boy\\" is a highly entertaining story about a pair of kids who get a glimpse of a ghost boy -- but exactly who is the ghost? \\"Tombmates\\" is a highly amusing poem about an Odd Couple pair of ghosts -- a tidy one and a messy one. \\"Police Report\\" is the account of a kid explaining how a ghost appeared to him, and ending with an amusing twist. \\"White Lady\\" is a poetic account about the White Lady ghost who haunts a cathedral. \\"The Boy Who Sang For Death\\" is a two-ended story about a young man who pursues Lady Death in an effort to get her to resurrect his mother. \\"Seance for Eight\\" is an amusing poem about a seance -- is it fake or not? \\"Mrs. Ambroseworthy\\" is an amusing-spooky story about a choir director who keeps coming back. \\"Night Wolves,\\" about a kid and a ghost who \\"wore my mother's face, my mother's wedding dress\\" is poignant and sweet.<br />\\"The Singer of Seeds\\" is a little weaker than the others, about the lingering effects of a young man killed by murderous farmers. \\"In the Silvered Night\\" is a pretty poem about nothing much, aside from ghosts. \\"Mandy\\" is the perfect story for dog-lovers, in which the ghost of a deceased pooch comes to visit her owner. \\"Haunt\\" asks the question \\"When I am gone/Who will I haunt?\\" \\"Green Ghosts\\" has a young girl dealing with strange green creatures who are flittering around like bats in her new home. \\"Souls\\" is an exceptional short story, starkly written and simple in its storyline, in which a boy grows up killing things that he decrees have no souls. \\"The Moon-Ribbon\\" is a beautifully-written story, somewhat like a fairy tale, in which an apparition helps a young girl named Sylva, whose only possession is a silver ribbon. \\"Prom Ghost\\" is when a girl finds out how her brother and the girl he was with died on their prom night. And \\"My Own Ghosts\\" is a charming little finale to the collection.<br />There isn't really a weak spot in this collection; Yolen's style ranges from charming fairy-tale-like stories to charming poems to eerie tales with a wry twist. As always, David Wilgus's soft-edged black-and-white drawings add extra dimension to the material collected in it.<br />For fans of things that go bump in the night, this is good entertainment.

Chrestomanci the nine-lived mage is one of the most interesting and amusing magicians in fantasy, and his slightly off-kilter parallel world is revisited in these four stories. Three were previously published, but the enchanting \\"Stealer of Souls\\" is new.<br />\\"Warlock at the Wheel\\" is the weakest of the stories, in which an unfortunate young warlock loses his magic to Chrestomanci, and tries to steal cars. Things don't turn out quite as he expects.<br />\\"Stealer of Souls\\" brings back several favorites from the four novels. Cat Chant becomes jealous when the talented Tonino Montana is brought to the castle by Chresomanci, but neither boy has time to deal with their problems. A strange magician called Spiderman kidnaps both boys as a part of his attempt to make himself a ten-lived magician -- one more powerful than even Chrestomanci.<br />\\"Carol Oneir's Hundredth Dream\\" features a little girl who controls her vivid and dramatic dreams, which are then bottled for others to use. Until the day Carol stops dreaming. She is taken to the magician Chrestomanci, who helps her discover that her dreams are being hit with a very unusual actors' strike...<br />In \\"The Sage of Theare,\\" the future Sage of Dissolution is sent to Chrestomanci's orderly world, by the gods who are hoping to avoid having him destroy them. Chrestomanci takes the befuddled young Sage under his wing, and shows how asking questions is a very good thing.<br />I found these stories to be a refreshing return to the world of the dapper, hyper-brainy world of Chrestomanci. The only exception is \\"Warlock,\\" in which he has no presence and is only mentioned. Jones' writing style is a little uneven, since these stories were written years apart, and as a result there is a slightly more cutesy feel to \\"Warlock\\" and \\"Dream\\" than to \\"Stealer.\\" However, her flair for characterization is as present as ever; the characters feel real, whether we hear about things from their point of view, or whether they are a little more distant, such as Chrestmanci himself.<br />The main problem with this book is that once readers finish it, there are (at present) no more Chrestomanci-themed tales beyond these five books. Read and immerse yourself in Jones' enchanting universe.distant, such as Chrestmanci himself.<br />The main problem with this book is that once readers finish it, there are (at present) no more Chrestomanci-themed tales beyond these five books.

Until, that is, Brie receives an alarming fortune from a wyll (wise-woman), and a summons from her aunt and uncle. Her old nurse is dying, and leaves Brie a mysterious golden arrow that becomes fiery when she touches it, and gives her visions. It also brings back her strong desire for revenge against the Scathians who killed her father, including a one-eyed man.<br />She sets off across the land of Dungal, and spends some time in a fishing village with a crazy wizard and a Ellyl waystation. But when danger comes closer, Brie must leave peace behind, and finds out who killed her father -- and about the impending invasion that threatens Dungal and Eirren.<br />In many ways, this book improves on the previous one. Pattou shows a greater sense of atmosphere, and is better able to sustain suspense and mystery. She also expands Brie from a stereotyped woman warrior into a more three-dimensional character, and is able to make the conflict seem more epic and realistic than ever before. Sago is an exceptionally-written character, a wiser-than-he-looks wizard who utters nonsense rhymes much of the time. Collun displays more depth and recognizable emotion than the-gardener-who-wants-to-go-home, with revelations about his family that hint at a possible future instalment.<br />Unfortunately, most of the cast of the previous book -- including the charming Taliesin -- is abandoned;; Silien and Collun are barely there, and Nessa and Taliesin are gone altogether, except for Collun briefly mentioning his sister. Ciaran the talking horse and Fara the Lassie-like Ellyl pet are more present than the characters that I was more interested in. There is a silly coffee joke early in the book, that Pattou refuses to let drop; also, a reference to chocolate in a mythical early Ireland. We are treated to a retread of Collun and Brie's bloodless romance, after Brie flirts aimlessly with a very boring fisherman, and Pattou introduces a long-lost-royalty cliche late in the book, that any adept fantasy fans will have spotted long before.<br />Brie has developed substantially from the previous book, in that Pattou effectively displays her conflicting feelings and her thoughts on revenge, whether it's wrong or right. Collun is, oddly, more intriguing when we see less of him; I would have preferred to see his fights with the Scathians instead of page after page of Brie in the fishing village. Silien is good, for what little there is of him; we see him taking an active stance against the Scathians. Hanna, the weather-woman, is an effective and interesting character, while the cowardly, nervy Monodnock sucked all the magic and mystery out of the Ellyl.<br />Despite this book's flaws, it remains a good read for fans of Celtic-themed fantasy, and plucks out some intriguing plot threads that will undoubtedly make any future stories intriguing, especially if Ms. Pattou brings back Talisen and dispenses with the silly coffee jokes.a silly coffee joke early in the book, that Pattou refuses to let drop; also, a reference to chocolate in a mythical early Ireland.

With a rather bland heroine and an overuse of fantasy cliches, it's a nice diversion but not much more.<br />Kaeldra has been raised by a farm-family in a generic village, despite the fact that her fair hair and green eyes mark her as being from a different land. However, those green eyes also mark her as a dragonsayer, a person capable of communicating with and sensing dragons. When her foster-sister contracts a fatal disease, Kaeldra goes in search of the only remedy: dragon's milk. She watches over three baby \\"draclings\\" while their mother hunts, in exchange for a small amount of milk.<br />Her sister recovers, but a dragonslayer arrives in search of prey. When the villagers murder the mother dragon, Kaeldra ends up taking care of the draclings permanently. She sets out to find a man pledged to help protect the dragons, taking her charges with her. But the dragonslayer is following her, and there are many people who want the draclings for their own purposes.<br />\\"Dragon's Milk\\" show a fair amount of promise at first. The mother dragon, Fiora, is an excellent character, tricky and fiery with a hint of protective nastiness. Granmyr's clay-shaping abilities, which either foretell the future or show something in the present, are an exceptional touch which is astounding to envision. And the gathering of the dragon kyn was an electrifying scene.<br />Unfortunately, Fletcher displays a lack of talent in many areas. For example, the three draclings are called Pyro, Embyr, and Synge; an adult dragon is called Byrn. The idea of dragons being named with human words referring to fire is absolutely absurd. I also found it grating to read about the production of dragon's milk. Fletcher emphasizes her research into dragons and how they were thought of centuries ago; however, dragons are traditionally seen as being cold-blooded, which means no nipples. Her writing style is fairly flat and lacks the sort of pulse-pounding passion displayed by many other fantasies. The love story between Kaeldra and Jeorg comes virtually out of nowhere and fails to evoke anything but yawns. And there are too many cliches, such as the evil king, the misguided love interest, the lost heritage of the heroine which gives her special powers, and so forth.<br />Kaeldra is a fairly generic heroine. She spends a lot of time whining about being different rather than utilizing her talents, and bumbles from one dangerous situation to another. Jeorg originally seemed like an interesting character, but becomes a gooey friend to the draclings after one of them cuddles him. Once the revelations about his past were made, he seemed less like a dangerous dragonslayer than like a rather whiny little boy playing at being a man. The intriguing Granmyr and the draclings redeem the book somewhat from the blandness of the heroine, since the draclings manage to be intelligent but not too intelligent, playful and sometimes very poignant.<br />A fairly nice little fantasy book to pass the time, or introduce children to dragon-related literature. However, this adds very little to genre, and never rises above \\"nice little story.\\"is fairly flat and lacks the sort of pulse-pounding passion displayed by many other fantasies.

1478500:US	50881246	R1LMDS2ZY5JEJK	068816613X	692618099	The Magicians of Caprona (A Chrestomanci Book)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Chrestomanci -- Italian style	Though \\"Magicians of Caprona\\" is the weakest of the Chrestomanci books so far, it remains an excellent fantasy with a strong storyline and extremely sympathetic characters. Jones introduces her parallel Italy with depth and skill, with some winks at \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\"<br />The spell-making Montanas and Petrocchis have been feuding for two hundred years, over a fight between two of their ancestors. Now they repeat hideous rumors about each other, cast disgusting spells at each other, and remain stubborn about the matter, even though they are now threatened by outside forces. The city-states are in conflict with each other, and the famed song \\"Angel of Caprona\\" is mostly forgotten, despite being the thing that can help protect them from harm.<br />Tonina Montana is apparently the only member of his household who is unable to cast spells. His talents lie in communicating with cats -- but he finds himself an unwilling ally to a Petrocchi girl, Angelina, when they are both captured by the Duchess of Caprona. He, Angelina, and a cat must find the words to the \\"Angel\\" song and ally their families before it's too late.<br />As Jones explains in the foreword, this is an alternate Italy, still divided into city-states with their own Dukes, laws, and conflicts with one another, as they had in the Middle-Ages of our world. Anyone with knowledge of Italian history knows that the city-states offer a great deal of potential conflict, and Jones doesn't waste that potential.<br />Though the conflict of feuding rival families is a mild cliche by now, Jones handles it with a comic twist that keeps it from becoming stale. The twist of lovers from those feuding families is highly enjoyable, even though it is quite obvious from the beginning of the book. Her dialogue and narrative are as witty and entertaining as ever. The only flaw with the book is that the plotline becomes slightly fragmented toward the middle, and I found it slightly difficult to keep up with. However, the climax is outstandingly written.<br />Tonino is the hero that Jones does best: a Charlie-Brown type, mild-mannered but courageous when called upon to be brave, and his counterpart Angelica is similarly realistic. They don't like each other, but becomes friends out of necessity, overcoming their pride and preconceptions. Of course, Chrestomanci is in it -- less than in other Chrestomanci books, but he is his usual dapper, delightful self, doing all that he can to alleviate the problems plaguing Caprona.<br />Except for a period of mild confusion in the middle of this book, Caprona is an enjoyable jaunt into the magic-saturated world of Chrestomanci. A must-read for fans of magic and wizardry.outstandingly written.<br />Tonino is the hero that Jones does best: a Charlie-Brown type, mild-mannered but courageous when called upon to be brave, and his counterpart Angelica is similarly realistic.

1480160:US	50881246	R16CDRWC0KUXXX	0743223306	701397757	More, Now, Again: A Memoir of Addiction	Books	3	10	12	N	N	Not quite addictive	Reading an Elizabeth Wurtzel book is like watching a slow-motion train moving towards a stalled car: you don't really want to look because of the impending crash, but you look anyhow. Her latest book, \\"More Now Again\\" is a peculiar look inside the mind of a repeat addict, which has some definite bumpy spots sprinkled with insight.<br />It begins as Wurtzel is seemingly clean of her drug addictions, until she is prescribed Ritalin for an attention-span problem. However, she soon began crushing the pills and snorting them, as she once did cocaine, because she missed sniffing things. Soon cocaine and stolen pills are back in her life, as she ends up stuck in obsessive behavior patterns, engages in inept shoplifting, and spins back into the world of addiction.<br />Wurtzel is alternately annoying and sympathetic; she frankly admits to handicapping marriages whenever she can, and to stealing when big-store clerks don't serve her fast enough, though she claims to scrupulously not steal from small stores. At the same time, there is something pitifully sympathetic about her spiral into addiction and the humiliating arrest when she was unable to stop sobbing. It's difficult to explain exactly what qualities in Wurtzel are either annoying or endearing, because of the blatant honesty with which she presents unsympathetic facets of herself such as, for example, her rantings about how she feels for Timothy McVeigh. There are passages where readers will sympathize with Wurtzel's long-suffering mother, who wants her to be \\"normal.\\"<br />However, her descriptions of both drug addiction and the psychological state that drags certain people back to it is both harrowing and revealing. We see Wurtzel obsessively underlining interesting passages in a book and tweezing her legs to the bone, but walking around with filthy hair and a shirt stained with spilled coffee and tea. However, she does not go to the other extreme, which too often ends up glamorizing addiction; rather, she tells the reader plainly and calmly what she does, without overemphasizing it. Only occasionally does her prose lapse into a sense of true panic and/or despair. In one particularly affecting passage, she describes the mindset of a repeat addict: \\"It's the stuff people can handle that makes addicts get high. We get high over nothing.\\"<br />Perhaps the best look at Wurtzel is the picture on the back cover. Though at first glance she seems like a conventionally pretty blonde with artfully-arranged hair, makeup and clothing, her large, heavily dark-rimmed, staring eyes add an air of bizarre sadness to her face.<br />Her writing style has an addled air most of the time, as if she were still on drugs as she wrote it. The frequent lapses into self-examination are sometimes interesting but sometimes merely seem self-indulgent. However, they never lack in response quality: whether it is an angry bristling or nods of sudden understanding, the readers WILL react with one emotion or another.<br />Love her or loathe her, Elizabeth Wurtzel provides a bizarre, sometimes disgusting look at addiction in this follow-up to \\"Prozac Nation.\\" Her fans will enjoy it, her detractors will be revolted by it, and newcomers may not be sure what to think.reader plainly and calmly what she does, without overemphasizing it.

This, thankfully, is one of the latter, a delightfully twisted mystery that sparkles as much as any of the gems.<br />Meg Venturi becomes the heiress to a jewelry fortune when her grandfather unexpectedly dies; among the conditions of her grandfather's will are that she must take over half of the ownership of his respected gem and jewelry store. The other half is the domain of his partner, a dark, silent, mysterious man named Riley, whom the townspeople suspect of having killed the elder Venturi. Meg is unsure about Riley, but she does know that he is brilliant with jewelry.<br />But then strange, sinister happenings begin to occur around Meg. As she tries to unravel the dark mysteries that destroyed her grandfather before his time, she becomes the target of a killer with a mission that stems back to a scandal many years before...<br />\\"Into the Darkness\\" has many of the best attributes of a Barbara Michaels novel: the witty dialogue, subtle characterizations, strong heroine, unusual romance, and a wide range of supporting characters who are never what they seem. Readers who enjoyed lessons on roses, maze gardens, and old Gothic novels will enjoy the informative lessons on jewelry and gems. As she always does in her best books, Michaels includes plenty of information that will stick in the mind without being annoying.<br />Meg Venturi is a standard Michaels heroine: tough, no-nonsence, mildly sarcastic with a bit of trauma in her background to add extra dimension. Riley is more of a dark horse: it's hard to tell what he's thinking or why, from his first scene onward. Supporting characters like the despicable wimp Candy, her boor husband, the seemingly fragile Mrs. Venturi and hearty Uncle George are all well-rounded from the start, but with hidden depths that are revealed as the book goes on. Even the grandfather is a very alive figure, despite the fact that he dies at the beginning of the novel.<br />This is more of an \\"Elizabeth Peters\\" mystery than a Barbara Michaels one, as there is virtually no supernatural influence, no cults or ghosts or werewolves or anything of the sort. But it is an excellent mystery for those of you who like a little sexy pizzazz, past scandal, and a lesson or two with your guilty pleasure.a very alive figure, despite the fact that he dies at the beginning of the novel.<br />This is more of an \\"Elizabeth Peters\\" mystery than a Barbara Michaels one, as there is virtually no supernatural influence, no cults or ghosts or werewolves or anything of the sort.

1481455:US	50881246	R27PVWTFXJMDZG	0788193945	564872388	In Her Sister's Shadow: An Intimate Biography of Lee Radziwill	Books	4	47	50	N	N	Overshadowed	If Lee Radziwell is ever referred to, it is usually in minor passages in Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis biographies; a minor character in the overblown legend of the Kennedy dynasty. Yet &quot;In Her Sister's Shadow&quot; offers a new view of Lee Radziwell and the parallels to her more famous sister.<br />The book covers Lee Radziwell's three marriages, two children, and multiple careers ranging from an author to an interior decorator to an actress. It also covers the unspoken rivalry between her and Jacqueline Kennedy. Though Lee was often considered the prettier and more interesting of the two, her sister became an internationally beloved figure. Lee's quest for happiness, glamour and fame is the central focus of this biography.<br />Upon finishing this book, it is easy to see parallels between Jackie and Lee: both married powerful men, both were reputed to be difficult to get along with, both thrived in glamour and fashionable circles. Yet Lee often seems to be the more interesting of the two, simply because she did not have the &quot;Camelot&quot; myth and the Kennedy aura paving her way. She stumbled and fell more often than Jackie, and her repeated attempts to pick herself up make her a more real and interesting person.<br />The writing style is somewhat gossipy, though not as explicit as is usual in Kennedy-related biographies. When love affairs and marriages are referred to, the references are usually tasteful and discreet, except for the description of an obscene art exhibit made by Truman Capone. The photos are excellent, displaying Lee in a variety of  places and settings and in the different stages of her life, as well as ones of her children and ex-husbands.<br />Overall this is an intriguing read about an interesting woman who has been overshadowed for years by her sister. While readers may not truly like Lee when they are finished, it is difficult not to admire her.	2002-07-09

As before, it ranges from humorous to chilling, thought-provoking and well-written.<br />\\"The Magic House\\" is a brief Hansel and Gretel poem. \\"Witch's Ride\\" is a grafting of a folktale and some real-life events, about a woman considered a witch who isn't one, and a witch who isn't considered one. \\"A Conversation Among Witches\\" is just that, a conversation between three witches. \\"Boris Chernevsky's Hands\\" is a SF/F story that includes the legendary Baba Yaga, about a young man whisked away by Baba Yaga  in a giant mug. \\"Witch's Cat\\" is a self-description by a witch's cat. \\"The Passing of the Eye\\" is a hilarious glimpse of what happens when the hero Perseus is a little too polite to the three witches. \\"The Face in the Cloth\\" is a poignant story about a young princess whose life is overshadowed by her mother's deal with three witches.<br />\\"When I Grow Up, by Michael Dee\\" is another funny story about a little boy who wants to be a warlock. \\"Pythagoras\\" was a little harder to understand, the apparent implication being that he was a wizard. \\"The Promise\\" tells of two young children, born in the same hour of two close friends, who are supposed to remain together, but who are threatened by an evil sorcerer. \\"Circles\\" is about when wishes are granted through a little magical ritual -- though not always the way that is wished for. \\"Weird Sisters\\" is about the Macbeth Witches. \\"The Woman Who Loved a Bear\\" is a Native American fable similar to \\"Cinderella.\\" \\"When Love Came to Witch Alfre\\" describes the problems when a witch falls in love. \\"The Sword and the Stone\\" is an extremely enjoyable Arthurian tale about Merlin, a mysterious stranger, and a sword in a stone. \\"Witchfinder\\" is a story about a poor old woman accused of making cows dry up. \\"Witch Call\\" is a Wicca-themed poem.<br />There are a few dead spots in this collection, but overall it is a highly enjoyable collection of short stories and poems.

Though marred by one jarring short story, this collection is overall beautifully written and well thought out.<br />\\"Another Count of Angels\\" is an endearing little poem for a writer or an artist. \\"Once a Good Man\\" is a heartwarming fable about a man who wishes to see both heaven and hell. \\"Tale of Two Peters\\" is when Saint Peter bumps into Peter the Great. \\"School Visitor\\" is a beautiful drabble about children describing the multicultural bevy of angels that they have seen. \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" is a fifty-word drabble in which Jacob sees the angels going up the ladder... or is it down? \\"The House of Seven Angels\\" is a story about a Ukrainian rabbi who has the Angel of Death lurking over him.<br />\\"Manya's Story\\" is an intriguing poem about a little girl who is \\"sold\\" to her neighbors so the Angel of Death won't claim her as it did her siblings. \\"Lady Merion's Angel\\" is about a woman who finds an angel in her garden. \\"Angelica\\" was one story I was uncomfortable with, about the angel Pistis Sophia and Adolf Hitler as a small boy. \\"The Angel of Mons\\" is a letter from a young man in World War II who sees angels. \\"The Boy Who Had Wings\\" is sweet and poignant, a story about a young man born with wings. \\"Child's Prayer\\" is an entertaining poem, with an accompanying amusing picture. \\"Brother Kenan's Bell\\" is based on an old legend, about a monk who tries to get a bell to ring with no clapper.

Dragons, magic, wizards, and dozens of different islands are all entwined in an intriguing contrast between the young and the old, death and life.<br />Arren, prince of Anlad, comes to Roke to tell the wizards there dire news: Magic is seeping out of his country, where words no longer have power and spells are forgotten. The aged Archmage, Ged Sparrowhawk, sets off with the eager, sheltered young prince to find out what is draining the \\"wells of wizardry.\\"<br />As they cross Earthsea, they find more difficulties, places where magic is draining away, the dragons are dueling, spells and songs are forgotten, and the dead are crossing over under the influence of a mysterious figure who is at the source of it all. Great changes are in store for both Arren and Ged before they can deal with the strange forces changing Earthsea...<br />It's undeniable that the original trilogy of Earthsea novels were superior to Le Guin's later Earthsea works, both in literary and storytelling terms. Le Guin's writing had clearly matured somewhat from the more formal manner of \\"Wizard of Earthsea,\\" as here we have better insight into Arren's thoughts and feelings. The dialogue is also less formal, as we have more jokes, teasing, and an amusing scene where Arren and his \\"nuncle\\" Ged are playing around with accents and dialects.<br />It is still fairly formal; however, the villain of this piece evokes greater horror than did Ged's shadow in the first book. At the same time, deep poignancy is present in such scenes as the dead looking out at the living, and the old woman hysterically crying out her true name, because \\"there are no secrets, and there is no truth, and there is no death.\\"<br />The relationship between the young, naive Arren and the more experienced, older Sparrowhawk is the underlying thread in this novel. Though Ged, to Arren, lessons and philosophies are revealed to the reader and spelled out in a way that will leave them thinking carefully. And Le Guin provides an intriguing contrast between age and youth: Ged's experience and wisdom are necessary as Arren knows virtually nothing about what could cause the crisis, while Arren's innocence and loyalty are necessary as a counterbalance.<br />Ged shows a weariness in this book not present before; his reflections on death and life seem to be connected to his greater age. Arren is an essentially good young man, very realistic in that he is not a spoiled brat, but has never been given the opportunity to do anything difficult and good before in his life. The supporting characters are rarely around long, and none develop the depth of those main two; though many references are made to the previous two books, especially the second, it is not necessary to have read them to understand this.<br />An entrancing fantasy epic and a thought-provoking look at life and death, this book is a treat for readers of any age.o Arren, lessons and philosophies are revealed to the reader and spelled out in a way that will leave them thinking carefully.

This collection is a refreshing exception, with many good stories and only a few that I didn't enjoy. Mike Ashley displays a great deal of knowledge about the genre and about what makes a good fantasy story.<br />\\"Mammoth Book\\" kicks off with an intriguing story by Theodore R. Cogswell, \\"The Wall Around the World,\\" a HP-esque story of a wizard boy who yearns to cross an incredibly high wall that blocks off another part of the world. \\"Darkrose and Diamond\\" is one of Ursula Le Guin's returns to Earthsea, a touching little love story. Robert E. Howard's \\"Valley of the Worm\\" is a relatively dry piece of work about a warrior reliving a battle against a monster. Ashley then digs back to the very beginning of fantasy for George MacDonald's \\"Golden Key,\\" a story about a young boy who finds a strange golden key. Another pre-Tolkien master is Lord Dunsany, whose chilling \\"Hoard of the Gibbelins\\" tells about a man's run-in with the goblin-like Gibbelins, who eat \\"nothing less good than man.\\" Clark Ashton Smith's \\"The Last Hieroglyph\\" is a vaguely Dunsanian story taking place on a future time when the world is dying. Jack Vance's \\"Sorcerer Pharesm\\" is an intriguing story about the naive thief Cugel and the creature TOTALITY.<br />Darrell Schweitzer's \\"King Yvorian's Wager\\" is a very traditional-feeling fable about a proud king who makes a wager with Rada Vatu, a very sinister god. Fritz Leiber's \\"Howling Tower\\" is a story about a barbarian and his sidekick Gray Mouser, who find a strange tower in a wasteland, and a man who has been afraid for many years. Michael Moorcock and James Cawthorn bring back Moorcock's classic anti-hero Elric of Melnibone for an adventure with a love interest, ghouls, and a mad minstrel. Robert Zelazny brings Dilvish the Damned from Hell for a new battle in \\"Bells of Shoredan.\\" Tanith Lee produces an intriguing, beautifully-written short story in \\"Hero at the Gates,\\" where a strange man arrives to help a desert city escape an evil scourge. Patricia McKillip's beautiful \\"Lady of the Skulls\\" has a group of men arriving at the home of the mysterious Lady. Louisa Cooper's \\"Sunlight on the Water\\" is an excellent story, in which a man mourning his beloved late wife finds out a few things he hadn't noticed about her personality. Harlan Ellison's \\"Paladin of the Lost Hour\\" is about young Billy's friendship with the strange old Gaspar, who hides a secret side to his personality.<br />Theodore Sturgeon provides the slightly disturbing \\"Yesterday Was Monday,\\" in which it is found that the world is only illusion. Charles de Lint's \\"Pixel Pixies\\" is a light fantasy about irritating little pixies and industrious hobs. Another classic fantasy is A. Merrit's \\"Moon Pool,\\" a bizarre fantasy about strange and beautiful things along the moon path. Lucius Shepard's \\"Man Who Painted the Dragom Griaule\\" includes many of the usual trappings of fantasy, but thankfully does not fit into the ordinary mold. James P. Blaylock's \\"Nets of Silver and Gold\\" is an intriguing story about two childhood friends, one of whom definitely has an unusual outlook. Lisa Goldstein's \\"Phantasma of Q____\\" takes place in a world quite like ours, except slightly different in its fantasy elements, in which a phantasma has shown up in front of the author. James Womack earns an \\"Audience,\\" a poignant story in which a curator tells a saddening story to the narrator. And the collection rounds out with Michael Swanwick's \\"Edge of the World,\\" a slightly bizarre but very snappy story.<br />With a gorgeous, intricate cover and a foreword by Ashley before every story, this is obviously not a quick-and-dirty collection. Rather, it shows a great deal of thought. Only a few of the stories left me unaffected; I wasn't really impressed by Moorcock's, Howard's, or Sturgeon's. On the other hand, most of the others were ones I had not read before, and I enjoyed the introduction to underrated fantasy authors.<br />Fantasy fans searching for good, original, non-derivative reads should check out this book, for stories ranging from earliest fantasy to modern-day twists and turns. Good work, Mr. Ashley.asy authors.<br />Fantasy fans searching for good, original, non-derivative reads should check out this book, for stories ranging from earliest fantasy to modern-day twists and turns.

He's also six years old.<br /><br />And despite the fact that Orson Scott Card's sci-fi classic is about a little boy learning how to be a warrior, \\"Ender's Game\\" is a pretty gripping and sometimes grim adventure story. The descriptions of children being taught out how to be cold-blooded warriors is pretty creepy, but the well-developed future world that Card comes up with is pretty awesome.<br /><br />After a fight with a gang of bullies, Ender Wiggin is approached by an army officer who wants him to join the elite Battleschool, where kid geniuses become soldiers -- basically because aliens are about to attack Earth AGAIN and may end up wiping out the human race. His brother Peter is too wild and cruel, and his beloved sister Valentine is too mild-mannered.<br /><br />Ender accepts, and quickly finds himself in a dog-eat-dog space school where he soon becomes loathed for the special treatment the teachers occasionally give him -- when they aren't observing his every move. And it soon becomes obvious that Ender has a natural ability that exceeds that of most of the Battleschool recruits: he instinctively knows how to outmaneuver his opponents and protect himself in a fight, even if he annoys some of the \\"army\\" commanders who don't like being outshone.<br /><br />Back on Earth, his brother and sister try to alter the increasingly unstable politics of Earth by subtle manipulation of the public, a situation that may bring the ruthless Peter into greater power. And as Ender reaches the end of his training, he faces both the buggers and the knowledge of what he is capable of.<br /><br />\\"Ender's Game\\" is kind of an unusual space opera, because the actual war between humans and buggers is not front-and-center until the last act of the story. Up until then, it's about following Ender and his equally unusual siblings as they develop prematurely into adulthood -- these are genius kids who can reshape entire worlds, but you're not really sure that they SHOULD.<br /><br />Card writes in a detailed but brisk style, with pretty realistic dialogue and some ugly dark spots (the description of Peter flaying a squirrel... for no reason). Ender's time at Battle School and Command School feel rather slow at times, only for things to blossom in the final laps of the novel -- Card suddenly turns all our feelings and expectations on their heads. The tragedy of children turned into soldiers becomes even more tragic as we discover what the war is actually all about.<br /><br />As you'd expect from Fascist Hogwarts In Space, there are a lot of kids at Battle School who are developed to certain degrees. But the center of the story is Ender himself -- and despite being a tactical genius with loads of natural ability, Ender never seems like a Wesley Crusher. Like a boy destined to be a Spartan warrior, his inborn skills are what will keep him from ever finding peace. His childhood is sacrificed for war.<br /><br />The other part of the story rests on Peter and Valentine -- Valentine is too nice, while Peter is gradually revealed to be a ruthless genius who works anything and anyone for his goals, which may or may not be self-serving. It's oddly fun to see the growing influence of \\"Demosthenes\\" and \\"Locke\\" on the cruel government.<br /><br />\\"Ender's Game\\" is an intelligent, gripping space opera with an undercurrent of intense tragedy -- it's kind of slow at times, but the strong writing and intriguing main trio keep it afloat.rematurely into adulthood -- these are genius kids who can reshape entire worlds, but you're not really sure that they SHOULD.<br /><br />Card writes in a detailed but brisk style, with pretty realistic dialogue and some ugly dark spots (the description of Peter flaying a squirrel... for no reason).

Though it doesn't answer all the questions, \\"Footprints at the Window\\" gives a note of finality to this trilogy.<br />It's been a stressful summer for Dan: He's found that Huntington's Disease runs in his family and may strike him down when he's in his forties, his father is being tested, and he is haunted by magpies and visions of the Faws, gypsies, whom he encountered in York -- even to the point of being drawn back into the waning days of the Roman Empire. Now a family of gypsies has come to the land near where his grandmother lives, and it's making Dan nervous.<br />What he finds is seemingly another Faw family, a few years down the line and with radically different names. And while trying to help the girl Oriole -- who bears a striking resemblance to Orlenda -- Dan is drawn back in time. Now it's the Middle-Ages, during the time of the Black Death, and he is the only person to recover from the disease. He encounters another incarnation of the Faw family, and for the second time tries to help the beautiful Orlenda escape to safety. What will happen will change Dan's life forever...<br />Perhaps the only flaw of this trilogy is that in the third book, some of the threads are left dangling. For example, I was never entirely sure why it is that Joe, Dan, and the Faws are repeatedly featured in the past; the implication seems to be that they were reincarnated, especially since Blossom refers to her grandfather being the exact image of Ambrose Faw.<br />Naylor hasn't lost her talent for atmosphere, either between the characters or in a given place. Dan shows a plausible growth in character, and a new philosophical bent that he did not have in the first book. This new maturity is reflected in his actions in the Middle-Ages and his increased acceptance of \\"what will come will come.\\"<br />As the story progresses, we also see that it is less a story about gypsies, past lives or incarnations, or time travel, but rather a story about Dan and the inner struggles that are brought into focus and greater clarity by the events of the trilogy. Gratifyingly, there is also a note both of finality and of \\"starting again\\" in this book, a wistful acceptance, and a very real sense that sometimes a thing like Huntington's Disease can't be predicted.<br />A good conclusion to an extremely good trilogy, \\"Footprints\\" is definitely worth checking out.t gypsies, past lives or incarnations, or time travel, but rather a story about Dan and the inner struggles that are brought into focus and greater clarity by the events of the trilogy.

It's not clear why many reviewers seem to expect this to be an earth-shattering fantasy, when that is clearly not what Lickiss is aiming for.<br />Unpublished writer Piper Pied's grandmother has just died, and Piper finds that the house has been left to the first person to throw dirt on the coffin -- her. She settles down into her new sanctum, only to be disturbed when a decidedly attractive elf appears in her kitchen. Aelvarim turns out to be an old friend of Piper's grandmother. He then introduces her to the world of Fairy through one of the house's doors, where tiny sprites flit around and pull her hair, a woman-hating wizard growls, and a cheerful dwarf digs up \\"stuff\\" in a mine.<br />But all is not lightness and air. Aelvarim is unswerving in his belief that Grandmother was murdered, and soon Piper begins to believe it as well. Upon learning that Fairy and its inhabitants can be altered by fiction from the human world, Piper begins the search for a book that was never finished -- and her grandmother's murderer.<br />Lickiss seems to be aware that few elements of her book are truly new -- in fact, in places she spoofs the conventions of fantasy and magic. At one point, Malraux the dwarf explains a few things about the dark and high elves (\\"If you ask me, the elves over the water are nothing but a bunch of snobs\\"), and about the conventional mindset for a wizard. When Aelvarim describes how fiction alters Fairy, he ends it off by praising a certain person for his muscular, handsome physique: \\"Thank goodness for Tolkien.\\" That and a joke about \\"feminine matrices\\" add an element of humor into the plot that help buoy it up.<br />One of the biggest difficulties is that the cast of characters is quite small, and the number of Fairy denizens is even smaller. It makes the possibilities for the murderer quite limited; though Lickiss is clearly at home in small casts, in future books with a \\"murder mystery\\" theme she may want to expand the cast slightly. Hints are also dropped about the murderer throughout the plot, with the result that I could guess who it was relatively soon. (And I'm not very good at solving murder mysteries) On the other hand, it's refreshing to read a fantasy where the romance element doesn't become too overwhelming; there is nothing headier than a few intense kisses.<br />Piper is a pretty good heroine; at times she seems a little too restrained around the Fairy inhabitants, but is a pretty normal young woman with no exceptional qualities. She is also an unpublished writer, which may endear her to aspiring writers. Aelvarim is a charming character, though I preferred the scenes where his alienness rather than attractiveness is emphasized. He has a childlike enthusiasm and naivete which shows up in such scenes as when he marvels at a shopping mall or tries to use Piper's toaster. Malraux the dwarf is a fun character, with a mischievous sense of humor; the pixies are not really too important to the plot.<br />\\"Eccentric Circles\\" is a good first novel, and a good light book for those who like a sweet, often charming read.early at home in small casts, in future books with a \\"murder mystery\\" theme she may want to expand the cast slightly.

But how much of \\"Jackie\\" did the public see, and how much was real?<br />We travel from the beginning of Jackie's life to near its end (though the biography stops short of her death, or that of her son): a girl raised between the ultra-womanizer Black Jack Bouvier, and ruthless social-climber Janet Lee Bouvier Auchincloss. Jackie became accomplished, admired, beautiful, and eventually married into the politically ambitious Kennedy family, a now legendary marriage. It chronicles her time in the White House, the death of her husband, her loyal campaigning for Robert Kennedy, her marriage to the wealthy Greek businessman Aristotle Onassis, her second widowhood, her career as a publishing editor, and the early adult lives of her two children.<br />Heymann avoids some of the pitfalls of many Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis biographies, such as excessive fawning on Jackie herself, and excessive speculation on her inner state. He doesn't avoid all of them; there is a great deal of information on not only Jack's raunchy extramarital affairs, but those of Jackie's father, Joe Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, and Ari Onassis. He does, however, provide equal information about relevent \\"supporting players,\\" such as Jackie's sister Lee Radziwell and Onassis's tragic daughter Christina.<br />Fans of Jackie might not like this book; Heymann does not gloss over Jackie's many flaws, and utilizes many testimonies to back himself up. Jackie is revealed as a shopaholic who spent money without restraint, was quite manipulative, and often acted in a very cold, unfeeling manner. Yet he also emphasized her very real sorrow when Jack died, and how it affected her for a long time after. Readers will find themselves unable to sympathize at all with Jack, given the behavior chronicled in here. In fact, Heymann seems to be either showing the harsh, brutal truth about both of them, or is slanted away in sympathy. However, he uses the same treatment for every person, ranging from Marilyn Monroe to Frank Sinatra. Readers will have to judge for themselves what is the correct portrayal.<br />Heymann does a very good job chronicling other people's opinions of Jackie in this book, from prominent people such as Gore Vidal down to Grecian store clerks. Rather than painting a picture, he puts together a mosaic of very small pieces, interview snippets, sightings, and so forth. His writing style is pleasant and well-ordered, not stiff or difficult at all.<br />Heymann's biography is a nice gossipy read, if you don't mind reading a few very long chapters on Jack's extramarital activities. Pleasantly written, well-researched, with either a dislike of the subject or a very impartial eye. You be the judge.harsh, brutal truth about both of them, or is slanted away in sympathy.

Thankfully this book will soon be reprinted by the excellent imprint Firebird books; it's an enchanting short novel full of vivid images and characters.<br />Peri's father was drowned, and her mother lives half in a dream world. Peri herself scrubs floors for a living, and remains embittered against the sea that stole her parents both in body and in mind. One night as she is weaving hexes to cast into the sea, she encounters Kir, a young prince with an obsessive longing for the sea. He asks her to put a mysterious message in with her hexes, and she agrees. A sea-dragon with a gold chain around its neck surfaces not long after she tosses the hexes into the ocean, and a passing mage named Lyo tries to take the chain for the fishermen -- except he accidently turns it into hundreds of tiny flowers.<br />Soon strange things begin to surface from the sea, just after Kir and his father leave for a distant island. Peri encounters the sea dragon pulling itself onto the land, and sees it transform into a naked young man who strongly resembles Kir. A years-old web of magic, love, revenge, and sea-longing must be unraveled before Kir can find peace, and Peri can find love.<br />One of the enchanting things about Patricia McKillip's novels is their simplicity. Though we have some of the essential trappings of typical fantasy -- wizards, dragons, mermaids, kings and princes and plenty of magic -- they are used in a very diffeent manner than most readers will be used to. The plotline is deceptively simple, and has the feeling of being far more complex than it is. Several plot elements can be guessed ahead of time, but this does not detract from the storyline.<br />As always, her prose is full of magic; the descriptions are lush and beautiful, even the descriptions of the sea-dragon. In such cases as the description of the sea-lady, they are exceptional, even for McKillip. At the same time, this dreaminess is balanced out by the homey atmosphere of the inn where Peri works. The dialogue ranges from poetic, almost songlike, to chummy and amusing.<br />Peri is an unusual heroine: she isn't pretty, sweet-natured, powerful, or anything unusual but kind and angsty. McKillip repeatedly emphasizes that, unlike Cinderella, Snow White or similar floor-scrubbing protagonists, Peri has calloused knees, perpetually messy hair, and a nose that she perceives as being too big. Yet she is entrancing to some of the male characters, and respected by all of them. Lyo is reminiscent of the \\"Riddlemaster\\" character Rood, with his offputting wit and uncanny clear sight. Kir drips angst and unhappiness, especially since he seems unable to love anything or anyone on the land. The unnamed sea-dragon/youth is almost babylike in his trust and eagerness to learn.<br />\\"Changeling Sea\\" is an exceptional story, full of magic, romance, and a small cast of exceptionally-developed characters.

1487709:US	50881246	R2O27ZUCYYEEJJ	0961596147	516598977	The Wind Boy	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Nice story	One of the relative few pre-Tolkien fantasies, originally published in the 1920s, \\"Wind Boy\\" is substantially more juvenile than books of that sparse fantasy era. Despite a slightly dated feel, it's a cute little read that children may appreciate as a bedtime story.<br />A strange girl called Nan arrives in response to an ad for a housekeeper, put out by a refugee family in an idyllic little village. The only problem is a mysterious figure, wearing a cloak and a frightening mask, that is roaming around the neighborhood and scaring the kids. Nan drives the Masker away, then helps out the overworked mother and her two children, Gentian and Kay.<br />It is soon revealed that Nan is not all she seems. She brings the two children into the fantastical Clear Land to be fitted for silver and gold sandals that can walk on the air. They also befriend the Wind Boy, a beautiful young boy with a pair of purple wings. Gentian and Kay continue their jaunts into the Clear Land with their friends, until the identity of the Masker threatens all of them.<br />This is a cute little fantasy; the style of it, which includes constant addresses from the author to the readers, is somewhat dated, as is the idyllic village life with such career-named characters like \\"Artist\\" or \\"Policeman.\\" There is no family strife, problematic parents, and there are no villains. However, if the young readers do not dislike these elements -- or lack of them -- then they may like this book. It's ideal for very young kids, as there are no plot complexities or frightening elements.<br />The writing style is somewhat flat, as often the author addresses the readers rather than describing, for example, Gentian's transitions into the Clear Land. However, the biggest bonus are intriguing scenes such as the weaving of the \\"starry-brightness,\\" as well as the charming little illustrations.<br />A cute early fantasy for young kids with a high nostalgia factor. For all sweetness and light, try reading this.	2002-07-04

Hardly his best, but not his worst.<br />In the aftermath of &quot;Sourcery,&quot; Rincewind is lost in the Dungeon Dimension. But in a million-to-one-chance, he is drawn back into the real world by a fourteen-year-old demonolist awash in hormones and delusions of grandeur. Eric is convinced that Rincewind is a demon, and is demanding three things: that Rincewind make him live forever, give him control of the entire Disc, and give him the most beautiful woman in the world. Rincewind, unsurprisingly, can't do these things.<br />An unwary snap of the fingers sends Eric, Rincewind, the Luggage, and a very sarcastic parrot to the land of the Tezumens, who serve the bloodthirsty demon-god Quetzovercoatl. Their misadventures in the void of non-creation, back in time to the topless towers of Tsort, and finally to hell itself give Eric what he wishes -- or does it?<br />The first word that comes to mind to describe &quot;Eric&quot; is SHORT. This book is slim even with the larger typeface and margins, but in Pratchett's spare style it packs a fair amount of story into the 200 pages. Old favorites like Rincewind and the Luggage return; Eric steals many of the scenes he's in, as he is obsessed with women and power, but whiny and immature - a teen boy with delusions of grandeur.<br />Pratchett adds some delightful spoofing of the Aztecs, especially their preoccupation with human sacrifice and feathered headdresses, and the Trojan War (in which we meet his versions of Odysseus and the relatively plain Discworld counterpart of Helen of Troy), complete with &quot;toppleless towers&quot; and a wooden horse. His vision of a revamped hell -- in which demons show vacation slides to damned mortals -- is somewhat reminiscent of Craig Shaw Gardner's Netherhells, but is perhaps the funniest part of the book. And Pratchett's cleverness shows up in the &quot;fulfillment&quot; of Eric's wishes -- it's a clear example of &quot;be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.&quot;<br />Rincewind is gradually growing in dimension, beyond &quot;cowardly wizard,&quot; and shows that he does, in fact, have some brains and thought processes. Eric is a twitty teenage boy, a little too clueless to be plausible. And the parrot really steals the show; his acid wit, aggressive demeanor, scruffy appearance, and constant use of the word &quot;wossname&quot; make him a hilarious essential. It's too bad he doesn't appear again in the series.<br />&quot;Eric&quot; is hardly the best book in the series, but it does make a nice diversion for readers who enjoy madcap antics and spoof-filled stories.art of the book.

Far from it; in many ways, I found \\"Magickers\\" to be a superior work of fiction.<br />n ankle injury has sabotaged Jason;s chances of going to soccer camp, and with his stepfamily going on their own trips, he faces a bleak summer. Until, that is, his English teacher shows up with the application for a special camp called Camp Ravenwyng, for special and talented people. He can either go to \\"geek camp\\" or to his weird stepgrandmother's. Jason chooses the camp.<br />Despite the ramshackle appearance of Ravenwyng, and the slightly eccentric teachers, Jason soon begins to enjoy himself with a cluster of new friends. But on his first night, he ventures outside his cabin -- and is bitten by a wolflike creature that snarls \\"You're mine\\" before vanishing. Though the teachers reassure him that it's nothing important, he isn't so sure. And there is an odd feeling about Ravenwyng: a pool of water speaks the name of the cabin he will attend, tiny objects are being pilfered from a certain cabin, strange dreams, and Jason overhears some very suspicious conversations among the teachers and the leader of the Camp, Gavan Rainwater.<br />Then the teachers reveal the true nature of the camp: It is to train them as Magickers, powerful magicians who will resist the evil Dark Hand of Brennard, Magickers gone bad. As the savage Wolfjackals draw closer to Ravenwyng, and a magical \\"manna\\" storm is brewing around them, Jason may be the only person standing between the Magickers and destruction.<br />This will undoubtedly be an unpopular review, as I find this to be superior to the Harry Potter series. But Drake has better descriptive ability, characterizations, and sense of atmosphere. This book never uses cartoonish characters stereotypes, or low humor. Jason is important, but not hugely unique or adored. Ravenwyng's teachers are realistic and effective authority figures that do not detract from the preadolescent heroes. The bad guys are bad for a reason, rather than being without motive. And, in a twist that is quite refreshing in modern fantasy, the climax does not depend on a deus ex machina, but on the effort of the characters.<br />Jason is a good hero, thoroughly sympathetic and believable in his characterization; his determination and nervousness about his scar attracting evil forces are extremely evocative, as is his attitude whenever an obstacle is put in front of him, and his willingness to support and help his fellow younger Magickers. Bailey is mildly ditzy, but her pleasantness and helpfulness shine through. Gavan is a good break from the stereotypical mentor wizard, and comes across as a truly strong character. Supporting cast like the timid Henry, fiery Irish cook FireAnn, grandmotherly Aunt Freyah, and the others are all given their own little quirks to set them apart.<br />Drake shows a skilled hand at description and atmosphere. Though occasionally there is an awkward passage or two, overall she's very effective at evoking responses. One of the most effective scenes in the book is when a boy burns out his magic, and Drake handles his response delicately and very saddeningly. Among the chilling scenes are the Wolfjackal's attack on Jason and its later attempt to lure him over to evil, and the bizarre dreams that are connected to his future as a Magicker. My only real beef is that the response of the kids to learning about the Magickers seems a little too casual.<br />Fortunately this is only the first of a series of books about the Magickers, and I am definitely looking forward to \\"Curse of Arkady.\\" Thoroughly delightful and magical.but not hugely unique or adored.

Preiss and Reaves have a great sense of atmosphere and description; it's only too bad that this hasn't been made into a movie.<br />Amsel is a Fandoran, a member of a hard-working, small-statured race in a fairly bleak land. He is also a loner, a dreamer, and a scientist who studies just about everything. But his life is thrown into turmoil when a boy is found dead, apparently having fallen from Amsel's hang-glider. The boy's father and the inhabitants of the town assume that Amsel is in league with the Simbalese, a wealthy people who look down on the Fandorans. Amsel ends up running for his life to Simbala, in the hopes that he can avert a war. But in Simbala, a similar death has taken place.<br />It also jeopardizes the position of Hawkwind, a miner raised to royalty by the previous Monarch, and his Rayan lover Ceria. The bratty Princess Evirae, an arrogant royal with clawlike nails and really big hair, takes the opportunity to attack Hawkwind and try to gain the throne for herself. But as the Fandorans and Simbalese clash, a new foe comes from a frosty wasteland -- the colddrakes, nastier cousins to the dragons and led by a huge, intelligent colddrake called the Darkling. Recognizing that the colddrakes will destroy both sides, Amsel sets out to the legendary Glowing Caverns, to find the only thing that can stop the destruction.<br />It's a fairly straightforward plot, but is made less simple by the character interactions. The Fandorans and Simbalese don't just clash with each other, but with people in their own ranks. Such characters as Jondalrun and Prince Kiorte make mistakes and misjudge people; while readers may not agree with their viewpoints, they will at least understand them. And the villains are thankfully three-dimensional: The Darkling is doing his best for his kind, in the hopes that they won't die out, while Princess Evirae is not so much evil as bratty, scheming and manipulative. When thwarted, she acts like a child. It also shows the dangers of ignorance and jumping to conclusions without proof, as both sides do with circumstantial evidence that leads them to war.<br />And while almost every dragon idea has been exhausted, Preiss and Reaves manage to make them unusually original. The dragons in this are nearly extinct, but a wise, noble, and somewhat crabby race. The colddrakes are a separate but related species -- sort of like lions and tigers -- who are subservient to the wishes of the dragons. This concept is intriguingly fresh. The portrayals of the different cultures are also good: The simple down-to-earth lives of the Fandorans, the more elaborate and technological lives of the Simbalese, and the gypsy-like Rayans. Preiss and Reaves produce a lot of tiny differences between them, in memorable scenes such as the \\"voting\\" of the various Simbalese leaders, the aborted coronation, and a poignant glimpse of a long-dead dragon locked in a glacier. Young adults can read this; there is no profanity or graphic violence, and some hints of intimacy but nothing too obvious.<br />The writing and descriptions are pretty spare; the dialogue is quite realistic, although sometimes it lapses a bit into the formal prose of most fantasy novels. My main problem is that often the book jumps around too much; several times in one chapter, the focus will shift between several different places. It makes it hard to follow. On a quality level, the paper is thick and smooth, very solid-feeling. The illustrations (which ibook has thankfully retained) are soft-edged pencil drawings that accurately portray people and things in the books. The dragon/colddrake pictures are especially good.<br />For an unusual, well-characterized tale about dragons, nerdy little heroes, and epic battles, this is the book to get.ncess Evirae is not so much evil as bratty, scheming and manipulative.

Kaye had written more books like her \\"Death\\" series, she might have had a place almost as exalted as that of Agatha Christie. Best known for \\"The Far Pavilions,\\" Kaye also wrote other stories set in the exotic locations that she had visited in the past. Though it may be politically incorrect to reminisce for times when the British were a strong presence around the world, it's hard not to wish oneself into one of these exotic mysteries.<br />Twenty-one-year-old Amanda Derington is newly freed from her strict, oppressive uncle, and is travelling to Cyprus with a tour group that includes her uncle and aunt, a cynical romance novelist, a faux invalid and her doting husband, and an oddly attractive young artist. But after her aunt Julia enters a state of jealous hysteria and then dies mysteriously, Amanda finds a bottle of poison in her room. The artist, Steve, urges her not to reveal where she found it.<br />Amanda comes to Cyprus, with the incident seemingly behind her. But her host, the kindly Glenn Barton, has to relocate her to the eccentric Miss Moon's. His wife Anita has left him and is now living with an artist, claiming that her husband is cheating on her with several women. And as Amanda tries to find out who killed Julia, she finds that more murders may be in store -- including her own.<br />As always, M.M. Kaye evokes a bygone time of muted glamor, rugged Army officers, lots of flowers and atmospheric settings in exotic locales. Descriptions are good, not too flowery but help to bring images to mind. The dialogue is sprightly and realistic, very different for each person, and often hiding subtle clues as to the person's inner thoughts. Her characterizations are multilayered; characters like Anita Barton are not as simple as they seem, and may not be fully explained until the last pages.<br />Amanda is much like Kaye's other mystery heroines -- young, pretty, bright, observant, brave, a little naive, and essentially kindhearted. Love interest Steve is attractively insolent and brainy, while the mild-mannered Glenn Barton hides unusual secrets; his wife Anita also hides secrets, behind a facade of alcohol and scandal. Monica Ford, Glenn's secretary, inspires either indifference or pity, depending on the part of the book one is reading. Miss Moon is the truly unique character, an effervescent old lady who dresses on opulent clothing and jewelry according to the day of the week.<br />For a bit of nostalgic escapism, open \\"Death in Cyprus\\" and enjoy the exotic places and mind-bending mysteries. Then read the rest of the series, which is every bit as good as this book.attractively insolent and brainy, while the mild-mannered Glenn Barton hides unusual secrets; his wife Anita also hides secrets, behind a facade of alcohol and scandal.

A muddled SF/F story, with tinges of lackluster commentary, romance and action, this book is bloated, pretentious, humorless, and poorly written and characterized.<br />On the waterworld of Aquasilva, Cathan is the adopted son of a count, living in the remote province of Lepidor. The discovery of iron ore in their lands sends him to the capitol of Aquasilva, Taneth, to tell his father about their new wealth. Except nothing is as simple as Cathan expects. A religious and political war is breaking out in Taneth. The vicious Domain, with its loathsome holy warriors, is oppressing anyone who dares to step outside their mandates.<br />To act against the Domain is considered heresy. So Cathan joins a group of other heretics, some of whom are from a fragmented royal family that is now under the control of the Domain. There he learns new truths about his past, about his incredible elemental power, and about the future of Aquasilva.<br />Teenage authors tend to gain a great deal of positive press, whether they deserve it or not. Audley and fellow teen author Amelia Atwater-Rhodes do not deserve their press. While it is possible to write a good novel in one's teens, these two have not managed it. The plot itself is a fairly interesting idea, and if handled with delicacy and skill, it might have been an excellent book.<br />However, the writing and dialogue are as turgid and slow-moving as frozen mud. While the writing skills are on par with the average young adult novel, Audley tries to make his prose impressive and adult. This proves to be literary suicide: his lengthy descriptions are framed by rambling, overlong sentences and misplaced modifiers. The action scenes are quite dull to read. Audley tries hard to make them thrilling, but only succeeds in making them even duller. The climax sputters and dies out. His dialogue is clumsy and uneven, ranging from extremely formal to one man slapping another on the back and addressing him as \\"chap.\\" The love story is as clumsy as anything written by Robert Jordan: the hero and his girlfriend fight constantly, but they really love each other.<br />The idea of the planet of Aquasilva is intriguing in itself, a planet mostly covered with water except for a relative few land masses. The problem is that Audley creates improbable plant and sea life on the surprisingly Earthlike land masses, while introducing us to hardly any animal life. The oceans described are too deep to have bits of land sticking up. His technology is uneven as well; the mantas appear to be some exotic sea transport out of Star Wars, powered by the unexplained \\"firewood\\" and \\"seawood.\\" Audley makes a few halfhearted attempts to explain how these machines work, but the two kinds of wood are simply a cheap way out of this situation. He also does not explain why crossbows and similar weapons are used on a presumably advanced planet. This problem might have been solved if he had made up an ongoing tradition regarding the ancient weaponry, but he did not, and so that is another weakness.<br />The political and religious conflict on Aquasilva might have been interesting if presented well. But the hero's allies are noble and idealistic, while the Domain is utterly evil and cruel. There's no depth to the conflict or the sides on it. There are no bad heretics or good Domain people. It doesn't help that the conflict is also needlessly complex, with dozens of people introduced, mentions, and then all but discarded. This mix of complexity and shallowness only produces a muddled, incoherent mess.<br />Perhaps the most difficult flaw is the characterizations. Cathan and his friends will fail to inspire any affection, interest, or even disgust from readers. They are two-dimensional cut-outs who drift through their tasks without any recognizable emotions. Audley fails to make any of the characters interesting or rounded; Cathan seemed to drift through shocking and angering situations without so much as a twitch, as if nothing at all bothered him. Ravenna is the only character who shows any passion, and she is so obnoxious that readers will hope the Domain burns her.uations without so much as a twitch, as if nothing at all bothered him.

Dawn Cook, like Kristen Britain, is one of the new authors who does not fall into this trap.<br />Alissa comes from a mixed marriage of the plainsmen and the hill people; her father, a Keeper, vanished when she was very young and her mother has raised her alone. Alissa has long since stopped believing that the Hold, a place where magic is taught, is a real place. But her mother insists that it is, and one day she sends Alissa off with her pet kestrel, Talon, to be taught how to be a Keeper. Alissa soon meets up with a plainsman musician, Strell, who recently returned to find that his family is dead. The two grate on each other immediately, with Strell prejudiced against Alissa's hill upbringing and Alissa angry about what she sees as Strell's plains snobbery.<br />But Strell has something that Alissa needs: A map, drawn by her father and traded away to Strell by her mother. Strell doesn't want to give it up, and agrees reluctantly to accompany Alissa on what she sees as a fool's quest. Except it isn't a fool's quest; a psychic power calling itself \\"Useless\\" possesses Alissa's body, and when the two arrive at the Hold, they find only one man in the entire building. Bailic is looking for a book known as the \\"First Truth,\\" created by a powerful Master and put in the keeping of Alissa's father. And now he believes that Alissa and Strell can lead him to it...<br />It was refreshing to read this book, in a market flooded with cliched sword-and-sorcery stories. Cook does not seem to concern herself with making this book an epic, or cramming it full of complicated cultures and peoples. She focuses instead on two cultures, different and divided, and the Keepers of the Hold, which encompasses both. The magic is low-key, despite a major explosion late in the book; the descriptions of the tracings and wards are very evocative.<br />One interesting aspect of this book is the treatment of prejudice; both Strell and Alissa have prejudices and misconceptions about the other's culture, and these prejudices are comparable to Bailic's hatred of halfbreeds (like Alissa) and the hill culture. Very few authors could successfully pull off  giving the heroes the same flaws as the villains, but Cook does so without a feeling of strain. The travelling near the beginning drags on a little long, with only camping out to break the tension; the dialogue is endearingly real to life, even if it is a little repetitive when the two protagonists are offended. And the dual nature of the raku is intriguingly thought of, and will undoubtedly be touched on again in future.<br />Alissa is a pleasantly unconventional heroine in a genre of warrior women; she gets soggy, sulky, unhappy, irrational, and has no desire to leave her comfortable life for what she sees as a myth. Yet she overcomes many of these to become a more understanding person. Strell also is trying his best to be nice to Alissa, but often seems to put his foot in his mouth. Bailic, unlike many villains, is given motivations and past grudges to explain his current behavior. And \\"Useless\\" comes across as obnoxiously helpful, knowledgeable, and wry in his observations.<br />As there is no smut, graphic violence or profanity, children and teenagers as well as adults can read this book. Fans of Robin McKinley and Patricia McKillip will undoubtedly enjoy this simple but deep tale. The only flaw is that readers will have to wait for the sequel.../>One interesting aspect of this book is the treatment of prejudice; both Strell and Alissa have prejudices and misconceptions about the other's culture, and these prejudices are comparable to Bailic's hatred of halfbreeds (like Alissa) and the hill culture.

With an intricate plot, unlikely hero and intriguing mystery, this will captivate kids not ready for \\"Hobbit\\" or \\"Harry Potter.\\"<br />In the aftermath of \\"Rowan of Rin,\\" the boy Rowan is a hero to his village. Now growing a crop of succulent Mountain berries, the villagers have settled back into their normal routine -- until the Travellers come. The nomadic tribe has a history of friction-filled cooperation with the people of Rin, and their mockery of Rowan's triumph shows that nothing has changed. Several of the villagers also suspect that the Travellers are plotting to steal the Mountain berries.<br />Then the Travellers vanish, and villagers begin lapsing, one by one, into comas. The old wise woman Sheba utters another prophecy, and rails insanely out of fear of something that is coming -- an old \\"enemy.\\" Only Rowan and the half-Traveller Allun are able to escape, and they rejoin the Travellers, who claim to have no knowledge of what is happening to Rin. They are planning to go back to the Pit of Unrin, to find a legendary golden city that was mysteriously destroyed. But when Rowan agrees to come, he will find something lurking that is too terrifying to imagine.<br />This book can probably stand on its own; references are made to the previous book, but no plot elements lean too heavily. The dialogue is never pretentious, a little stilted in places, but overall good. The descriptions -- especially chilling ones -- are even better, in such scenes as the one with the carnivorous trees with flexible roots, and Sheba's ranting. The only problem is that the cause of the villagers' affliction is pretty obvious from the beginning. Rodda makes up for this, however, with several twists to that plot device.<br />Rowan has grown since the previous tale, as we see him standing up to Sheba when she rails at and insults him.

After many years of pokes and prods at our ripe-for-ridicule government, Barry strikes out with an all-new and very funny book.<br />After an amusing dedication to his kids -- because they will someday pay his Social Security -- Dave launches into his giant-zucchini-ridden explanation of government, how it originated in ancient times. Then he goes on to the early United States (\\"Whereas in the course of human events it behooves us, the people, not to ask, What can our country do for us anyway? but rather, whether we have anything to fear but fear itself, so that a government of the people, by the people, and for the people may be one nation under God, who art in heaven...\\") and a heavily edited version of the Constitution (\\"Congress shall make no law regulating the capacity of toilets\\").<br />Then he switches to the present, where he explains things like the Republicans and Democrats and why they are radically different, the different departments like the Department of Education (which goes up in size as human stupidity grows), and then to Washington itself; he goes over its history, Capitol Hill, the pointiest thing in Washington (the Washington Monument), the White House, and the Mall. Then Dave proceeds to what everyone wants to hear about: Presidential elections. He examines the different ways of trying to get a candidate elected, such as nominating a loser; and then he examines several political figures, such as the Rev. Jesse Jackson, John F. Kennedy, John Glenn, and so forth. He also proposes some risky yet satisfying measures, such as giving candidates doses of sodium pentothal and forcing them to wear donor logos.<br />And what book on modern politics would be complete without coverage of the farcical 2000 presidential election? Dave revels in the idiocy of the situation before proposing that Florida be ejected from the United States. There is a bit of a subject deviation at that point, where he spends many pages describing the diverse and insane anti-paradise known as Florida. And then it's back to the 2000 election, and the very rainy inauguration of George W. Bush.<br />Readers may be inclined to hesitate when they see that this is a book about the government and politics, but there is no reason to be. If Dave Barry has any political preferences, they aren't evident in this book. He has a certain bipartisan manner of writing, in that he spoofs both major parties and small ones as well. Though the giant zucchini joke may get old fast, his writing is hilarious as ever; few of his jokes have been featured in columns or previous books.<br />Dave Barry is as funny as ever, every bit as able to amuse and entertain. If you laughed at the commentators during the 2000 elections and wondered why it is the Department of Education doesn't accomplish anything, then this book is very much for you...bit of a subject deviation at that point, where he spends many pages describing the diverse and insane anti-paradise known as Florida.

Dale Brittain is one of the more underrated fantasy writers, who manages to blend straight fantasy with a sense of comedy and wryness. The first book in the Daimbert series, &quot;Bad Spell in Yurt,&quot; introduced readers to the inexperienced wizard Daimbert; this book picks up where the last left off.<br />King Haimeric of Yurt is going away for a while, leaving his blunt nephew Dominic and royal wizard Daimbert in charge of the kingdom in his absence. But Daimbert soon finds that things in Yurt aren't as peaceful as they appear: Enormous savage horned rabbits are running loose. Saint Eusebius the Cranky, at the Shrine of the Holy Toe, has been appearing in dreams to different priests and hermits, with conflicting wishes. The wood nymph who lives near the shrine has to be moved, except she doesn't want to be. The strong-willed Duchess Diana has apparently fallen in love with her new huntsman, Nimrod -- and Dominic wants to marry her instead. And a twitty but well-meaning young wizard named Evrard is tagging along with Daimbert.<br />But solving each problem produces a new one. No sooner has Daimbert unraveled the mystery of the giant horned rabbits than he finds that a new one has cropped up. A mysterious zombielike monster is creeping around the countryside near the Shrine of the Holy Toe, and it's proving to be a much bigger problem than the horned rabbits ever were...<br />This book is as enthralling a mystery/fantasy as the previous one was, without repeating any plot elements. Brittain continues the good-natured jokes and occasional bursts of silly humor, such as the hunter called Nimrod or the horned rabbits. The whole idea of the Cranky Saint, the Shrine of the Sacred Toe, and his comical encounter with the dragon and subsequent sainthood was absolutely hilarious; Christians with a sense of humor may appreciate it. As for the plotting, it has actually improved: this book is more complicated and twisted, with a slightly tighter feel to it.<br />Characters return from the first book in the series, like the old wizard who served the king before Daimbert, and Joachim the saintly-but-not-annoying chaplain. There are some new ones, such as Evrard, a character who might be annoying if he weren't so earnest. The only character who fails to come alive is the wood nymph, who feels somewhat disconnected from the other plots. She did inspire some interesting theological discussions, of which there are more in this book than in &quot;Bad Spell.&quot;<br />A delightful sequel in an all-too-short series.

Here, he takes on Shakespeare and some of the trappings of fairy tales and fantasy novels, with a coven of odd witches, a bell-covered Fool who's no idiot, and a king who is, technically, dead.<br />King Verence of Lancre has been murdered by his cousin Felmet and Felmet's wife. The frustrated king is left haunting the castle as a ghost, and wondering what has happened to his infant son, the heir to the throne. The baby has, in fact, been dropped with a crown into the laps of three witches: Formidable Granny Weatherwax, mildly drunken and very maternal Nanny Ogg, and naive flowery Magrat. The witches decide to get the baby out of the country to keep him safe, and see him off safely with a troupe of kindly actors.<br />But things are still awry. Felmet, now acting as king of Lancre, is pretty obviously going insane, and his unhappy Fool is the one who keeps giving him tidbits of advice. Felmet and his iron-willed wife decide to stamp out the witches through malicious lies and rumors. But the witches have a few tricks (and spells) up their sleeves, and with they intend to deal with Felmet with the help of the Fool, the dead king, and a lot of furry little animals...<br />This book has it all: sweet stammering romance, Shakespearean quotes and jokes (Felmet's repeated questions about \\"Is this a dagger I see before me?\\"), time travel, ghosts, political strife, and twists on such themes as the long lost heir of a kingdom. There is a Shakespearean dwarf who pens brilliant plays all the time, who will amuse Shakespeare enthusiasts. Pratchett even manages a mild lesson that won't make readers grit their teeth, about how easily opinions can be shaped by false information from movies/books/magazines, or in this case, plays.<br />Granny Weatherwax of \\"Equal Rites\\" is more appealing here, with Magrat and Nanny Ogg to serve as counterpoints. (After all, Samuel Vimes of the \\"Watch\\" novels wouldn't be as appealing without Carrot, Nobby, Colon, and the others) Granny is tough, indomitable, but not without her flaws and weaknesses. Nanny Ogg serves as a sillier witch, with her instant attraction to alcohol and tendency to sing obscene songs (something parents will want to edit out). Magrat is a much younger witch, with dreamy ideas about occult jewelry, good witch godmothers, candles, runes, and no romantic experience whatsoever. Felmet is entertainingly crazy, but Pratchett doesn't let readers forget that he is a bad guy; his wife, on the other hand, is both evil and frighteningly sane. The Fool is also a refreshing character, a jester with a brain who hates his job. Tomjon (the prince) is unusually endearing for a Long Lost Heir; he seems like a real person. King Verence, despite being dead, is very vital and great to read about. And, of course, Death has his part to play, despite his inability to remember his lines.<br />Though not the best of Pratchett's novels, \\"Wyrd Sisters\\" is amusing and witty, wry and fun.

Kim, a teenage girl who disguises herself as a boy, is all too willing to do so for the grand sum of five pounds. But when a silent explosion hits her inside the wagon, Kim reluctantly is convinced that Mairelon the Magician's magic is real. Mairelon hears her story about the man who hired her, and then asks her to come along as his apprentice and assistant. Kim, with the less savory characters of London closing in, agrees quickly.<br />She soon is told what the deal with the silver platter is: It is the Saltash Platter, a magical silver dish that a lot of people seem to want. She and Mairelon go on a secret expedition through the English countryside, where they find an ever-complicating mystery around the Platter. The wizard and the lock picker must unravel the mystery and find out who is responsible.<br />It sounds dry and lackluster, but never is. Wrede sets the plot in a world quite like our own, but with a magic tinge, such as a mention of the Wizards' College, the attempts to get the Platter, and a real magician performing in the streets. However, she never overburdens the reader with her cleverness, as too many authors are prone to do. The plot is complex, but not overly so. And whenever it seems in danger of becoming too dry or serious, Wrede provides a humorous situation or line to lighten the mood.<br />The humor is quite different than in the Forest Chronicles. It's drier, wittier, slightly older in tone: The verbal sparring between Mairelon, Kim and Hunch; Mairelon's frequent grammatical corrections; several fake Platters floating around; and a cluster of pseudo-druids who dump their hodgepodge rituals when they find that they don't have the \\"Sacred Dish.\\" The dialogue is entirely realistic and filled with old London street slang, such as Kim informing someone that he is \\"bosky.\\"<br />Kim is an intriguingly tough heroine, with clear vision and a wish to get out of the streets where she has spent her life. Mairelon is witty and smart, but never strikes the reader as cocky or obnoxious. He's too pleasant for that. Hunch is crabby and perpetually suspicious, but somehow interesting anyway. The other supporting characters, in true Wrede style, range from menacing to mysterious to almost comical.<br />Sadly, there is only one sequel to this fun fantasy. Fortunately, Starscape will be reprinting \\"Magician's Ward\\" later this year, so that more readers can enjoy further adventures in Wrede's magical Regency period. A delightful mystery/fantasy, and definitely worth the read.f pseudo-druids who dump their hodgepodge rituals when they find that they don't have the \\"Sacred Dish.\\" The dialogue is entirely realistic and filled with old London street slang, such as Kim informing someone that he is \\"bosky.\\"<br />Kim is an intriguingly tough heroine, with clear vision and a wish to get out of the streets where she has spent her life.

Now he's determined to leave the unusual vacation behind him, and spend some time with his kindly grandmother Blossom. But his time in York keeps intruding on the present.<br />His grandmother has hired a migrant worker named Lonnie, who reminds Dan of one of the gypsies from York. A letter comes from Joe, saying that the Faw family wants the silver denarius that was given to Dan at the end of the first book. Blossom makes some cryptic comments about Huntington's disease being an \\"evil\\" handed down through the family. And when Dan goes into the basement, where a stream runs through, he sees the face of Ambrose Faw watching him from the water.<br />When a magpie begins following him, Dan captures the bird and later sets it free. He is swept back in time over a thousand years, to York in the declining years of the Roman Empire, where he encounters an ancient parallel to the Faw family. How does this connect to the present, and how can he help the beautiful gypsy Orlenda?<br />The plot picks up the pace in \\"Faces,\\" as some of the puzzles of \\"Shadows\\" are solved, but produce more questions as they are solved. For example, we see why Dan saw Jaspar as a wild man; but why does he see the Faw family sixteen hundred years in the past? What is the connection between these events and Huntington's disease? Or the connection between Blossom and the Faws? And what is up with those magpies?<br />Naylor's atmospheric writing is still present, with the nuanced dialogue and intricate characterizations of the first book. Not everyone is revealed on the outside, and that adds an aura of mystery to all the characters except Dan, who is our window to the events of the book. And though time travel is a well-worn cliche, Naylor manages to make it feel fresh and intriguing. It's virtually impossible to predict what is ahead for the characters or the plotline, and that's a delightful change from the usual ghost stories.<br />Undoubtedly \\"Footsteps at the Window\\" will be as good as \\"Shadows\\" and \\"Faces,\\" as the second book leaves the readers waiting for the answers to its many questions. Excellent fantasy story for kids and adults alike.ow to the events of the book. And though time travel is a well-worn cliche, Naylor manages to make it feel fresh and intriguing.

I was surprised that I actually liked parts of \\"Midnight Predator.\\" Atwater-Rhodes improves several of the weak areas of her previous books, but it was still quite flawed.<br />Turquoise Draka is a fighter for the Bruja witch guild, in competition for the elite Crimson with her rival Ravyn. After the two hit a stalemate, they are both approached by a mysterious businesswoman with a revelation and an offer. A vampire empire known as Midnight, once burned to the ground, has been rebuilt and repopulated by vampires and human slaves. And the savage vampire who founded Midnight, Jeshickah, may take control of it once more. An unknown employer wants some experienced fighters to kill Jeshickah. The problem is that Turquoise was once enslaved by one really nasty vampire named Lord Daryl, who murdered her parents and little brother, and kept her as his lapdog for a year before a vampire mercenary named Nathaniel helped her escape.<br />Ravyn and Turquoise soon take the task, and the reluctant Nathaniel sells them to the leader of Midnight. Except the leader isn't Jeshickah, it's a fledgling called Jaguar. Jaguar is strangely kind towards human beings, especially Turquoise and a teenage boy named Eric. Turquoise must confront her past, her fears and the questions about Jaguar's kindness before she can hope to deal with Daryl.<br />In many ways, this book is far better than the previous ones. Characterization is far superior: Turquoise has more depth than the execrable Jessica or the wannabe-tough-girl Sarah, though her past is too speedily covered. We hear about how horrifying her life under Daryl was, but we only get a few pages worth of flashbacks, most of which involve her getting backhanded. Jaguar is a better character than the defanged Aubrey or the wussy arty vampire Christopher, in that Atwater-Rhodes actually makes him both tough and vicious at times, but capable of kindness, and with a decided darker side that doesn't make him wussy at all. Ravyn is ridiculously two-dimensional; she doesn't seem to have any personality but that of a tough, leather-wearing, blood-licking girl who dislikes Turquoise. Nathaniel as the chic mercenary suave vampire is the only really outstanding character.<br />The romance is also more tolerable. Atwater-Rhodes shouldn't handle romances until she's had more experience with them; while the last two books revolved around the romantic tension between supposedly-tough human girls and uninteresting vampires, here it revolves around the lead character. The interest in Jaguar is a side subplot. However, Turquoise's adversary Daryl is pretty unimpressive, especially given his snap-hiss-growl attitude; Jeshickah was a far more convincing enemy, especially when one considers how many times we see Daryl getting kicked around.<br />One of the problems is that Atwater-Rhodes still tends sometimes toward melodramatic trappings; Ravyn's burgundy hair and \\"cranberry\\" eyes are one of those problems. The name \\"Midnight\\" is another; it's a silly name for something that is supposed to be that ominous. \\"Lord\\" constantly tacked before Daryl's name seems pretentious. Character names tend to be a bit hyperdramatic as well; while this is excusable among the vampires, I find it difficult to read consistently about modern characters called \\"Turquoise,\\" \\"Onyx,\\" \\"Frost,\\" and \\"Ravyn.\\" She also tends to hammer points over and over; some of the ruminations are repeated over and over, as are the constant reminders of how nasty Daryl is and what he did to Turquoise.<br />Midnight itself is badly-defined; we never get a really clear idea of what it's like, aside from that there are lots of rooms and that sometimes vampires are mean to the humans. I found it extremely amusing that there is an \\"exercise room\\" open to humans, free clothes and hygiene-related objects, and apparently good food; this seems less like a vampire citadel with humanslaves than an S&M hotel.<br />The cover is also a problem, featuring a person of ambiguous gender who doesn't really resemble anyone in the book. And finally, any person who appreciates a good ending will be grinding their teeth during the last twenty pages of this novel. Atwater-Rhodes' focus seems to be either wandering or narrowing to a pinpoint; the climax is anticlimactic, the dialogue is dull, the action is duller, and there are about a hundred loose ends waving in the wind. Readers may hit the climax and say, \\"That's it? Where's the ending? Where's the CONCLUSION?\\"<br />I'm relieved to say that Atwater-Rhodes is improving in many areas, especially her weakest points. But to be a really good author, she needs to start polishing and working a little more carefully.an slaves than an S&M hotel.<br />The cover is also a problem, featuring a person of ambiguous gender who doesn't really resemble anyone in the book.

He's delighted by the vacation, but puzzled by how his parents are acting. One minute they are gushing and effusive, the next cold and silent. He soon discovers why: His father has found that their familiy has a hereditary nerve disease called Huntington's Disease, which his father might have -- and might have passed on to him.<br />As Dan struggles with the knowledge that he might have a terrible disease, that might affect whether he can marry and have kids, he encounters a friendly cab driver named Joe Stanton, and a group of mysterious gypsies led by Ambrose Faw. The strange ways of the gypsies are intermingled with visions of Roman soldiers, and a mysterious feeling of dread that Dan gets every now and then. He is inclined to think the visions and dread are hallucinations -- but Joe sees them too...<br />Haunting writing abounds in this novel. Without a single word of dialogue, Naylor can provoke feelings of dread, mystery, sadness, fear, and surreality. Her dialogue is unpretentious and thoroughly ordinar, as you would expect a teenage boy and his friends and parents to talk; yet the reader can detect the undercurrents of emotion underneath them. Atmosphere is expertly done, especially in scenes with the gypsies. Their differences are noted but not judged, and she does a good job with Dan's reactions to such things as the casual planning of a funeral before the person is dead.<br />It's also interesting that she wove together two different kinds of &quot;haunting.&quot; Dan is haunted by his fear of having Huntington's Disease, a very realistic fear. At the same time, we view Joe and Dan both seeing visions of the past, such as a mute gypsy boy momentarily transforming into a lime-covered primitive tribesman, or the face of a Roman appearing in a pond.<br />This book is the first of a trilogy, and it shows.

Even those who dislike religious novels may want to check this one out.<br />On vacation from school, Matt Randall arrives at the creaky old house called Woodhall, where his sister Caro is the cook. Things are not going well for Matt: Caro is engaged to the flashy rich guy Jasper, who dislikes Matt, and Woodhall is ruled by a tyrannical old woman called only Madame. Because of the untimely death of her idolized daughter and the deformity of her son, Madame has turned against religion, God, and especially against her son, Theo.<br />However, Theo is a gentle and compassionate person who soon befriends Matt, as they are both quiet outsiders with a love of beauty. Matt also gets to know Madame's elfin granddaughter, Alix, who leads him deeper into the decayed gardens of the old house. But conflicts are rising: Madame is growing less tolerant of Theo, when he brings a group of young orphans to the house; and Theo is falling in love with Caro. A near-tragedy is necessary to unstraighten the kinks of the past...<br />Usually religious books have tepid plots, shallow characterization and choke readers on heavy-handed moralizing. This is one of the exceptions. Trevor's writing is delightful, and she displays an excellent knowledge of the human mind and why people do what they do, even if she doesn't agree with their actions. And she never beats readers over the head with the Catholic content; it's there, it's an interwoven thread through the plot that supports many of the characters as they go on.<br />Though Madame is a character who would be easy to make cartoonish, she is instead made a bitter, multilayered person with thoroughly believable reactions. Matt and Alix are great lead characters; Matt is the sort of next-door boy that we can instantly understand, while Alix is a little wilder and odder, but also quite sympathetic. Caro is the only disappointment; she seems to be an essentially generic character, without much personality. Theo makes up for Caro; at first glance he seems like the ordinary \\"gentle giant,\\" but gradually we see more of the guy underneath.<br />The writing style is excellent, very descriptive and evocative without being too wordy. The dialogue occasionally gets a little stilted, but overcomes that in scenes where the dialogue is entirely believable. The only unbelievable parts are where Theo speaks about Caro; it gets a little sappy there.<br />A delightful read and a great piece of fiction. Definitely worth it.thetic.

Somehow it manages to, despite a large gaping flaw near the end.<br />It kicks off on a strong note with Julian May's heartrending &quot;Star of Wonder,&quot; in which a saddened starship commander comes to Earth on a fateful night, and encounters a certain baby born in a desert stable. Dennis McKiernan's &quot;Ornament&quot; is sweet and poignant, although readers may not fully absorb the point of Rufous the fox and the Pysk Tynvyr without reading his other works. Andre Norton provides a sweet &quot;Very Dickinsy Christmas,&quot; in which a young woman encounters a ghost at a Christmas ball.<br />Christopher Stasheff provides a delightful &quot;What are we going to do with Grandfather?&quot;, in whichwe see a funny, endearing SF story about charity and Christmas cheer. &quot;I Sing of a Maiden&quot; displays Judith Tarr's great skill in atmosphere and beautiful language, where a young intellectual encounters Thomas Becket, who helps bring the spirit of Christmas back to her. Gael Baudino's &quot;Tidings of Comfort and Joy&quot; is the only blot on this collection: its only purpose seems to be to let her obnoxious, self-absorbed Wiccan protagonist sleep with a Catholic priest. The main character seems to have no identity beyond being a witch; virtually every thought and sentence reflects that. Fortunately the collection sprinmgs back into style with Richard Christian Matheson's &quot;Holiday,&quot; complete with a sunbathing Santa.<br />If you can bypass Baudino's disgusting story, this is a sweet collection of heartfelt, inspired stories about Christmas. Delightful read for Christmas and fantasy buffs alike.	2002-06-08

Before she knows what's happened, she's gifted with exquisite beauty, diamond tears, and \\"gold dandruff.\\" This turns out to be less of a blessing than she expected. Soon she's trapped in a tower, and forced to choose between the sadistic King and a kindly but idiotic Prince.<br />With the help of her geese, Alexandria escapes from the tower, and promptly stumbles into the grasp of omnivorous multi-headed ogresses. She manages to get them to employ her as a cook, only to find that they've captured the Prince as well. The two of them (with the geese, the fourteen of them) stumble from one misadventure to another, to the core of a political takeover and a long-past magical spell...<br />The basics of old fables and legends are expertly combined with a bright, independent but not cocky heroine to make a very original tale. This is not a feminist tale in the conventional sense of the word, in that Kindl seems to have affection for her male characters as well as her female ones, and that Alexandria is simply smart, matter-of-fact and independent. \\"The combination of great beauty and great wealth is a monstrous cruel handicap for a girl who simply wants to tend to her own affairs and her own Geese,\\" she informs the reader. The Prince is also a good character; at first he merely seems to be a slow-witted parody of the typical Prince Charming, but as the story unfolds, we see his sweet nature and his caring for Alexandria. This is one of the few fantasies where the love interest has significantly fewer brains, but is deemed \\"worth it\\" anyway.<br />The writing style is pseudo-ye-olde, with a distinctly ye-olde flair but never making the dialogue stilted or hard to read. Instead, it adds to the peculiar charm of the story that modern English never could have. The comments and dialogue are, at the same time, extremely witty and well-written; the melodramatic tone of fairy tales is relentlessly mocked. At one point, as she and her geese plummet towards the ground, Alexandria wails, \\"O woe! O! O! OW!\\" The ogresses are hilarious, especially when Alexandria feeds them a horse's saddle. No loose ends are left dangling; small hints of the heroine's background are present throughout the book. And of course, no geese are as talented and brainy as hers are, without a specific reason for being so.<br />A charming read for those of you who enjoyed \\"Spindle's End\\" and \\"Ella Enchanted.\\"ye-olde, with a distinctly ye-olde flair but never making the dialogue stilted or hard to read.

An orphan living with his Aunt Merry, he struggles to perform magic and can't even attract a familiar. When a feud between his aunt and the snobby weather-wizard Fulke ends in a vicious curse, Jermyn sends Fulke back to his home, and by doing so attracts an animal. Except it isn't the cat that was expected, but a skunk. Jermyn reluctantly accepts the skunk Delia as his familiar.<br />But the curse from Fulke has rendered Aunt Merry unable to do magic. She sends Jermyn to be apprenticed to the Theoretician Eschar, and for a while things seem to be working out fine. But then wizards begin to fall into strange magical comas, hideous weather threatens to destroy the city, and a malevolent Marquis from an anti-wizardry land seems to be connected to it all. Jermyn and Delia must uncover the truth about the magical plague before it's too late.<br />Jermyn is the classic \\"bright kid who just doesn't work well under normal circumstances.\\" He has a lot of power, but it works under peculiar circumstances, usually under stress. Aunt Merry, Fulke, Eschar, and Eschar's pretty ward Meggan are a little less developed, but they are easily recognizable with individual personalities. Unusually endearing is Delia, with her baby-talk thoughts and willingness to spray anyone that she sees as being a threat to \\"Je'm'n.\\"<br />The only problem, perhaps, is the pacing. Zambreno keeps pretty much the same pace throughout the book, regardless of the situation. She also needs to work a little on atmosphere. The descriptions are pretty average, while the humorous situations and dialogue are excellent. And, of course, her idea about a country that wizards emigrated to from a repressive homeland is brilliant. The mystery is twisted and well-written, with hints sprinkled through the book as to who the guilty party is, but readers probably won't guess who it is until the climax.<br />A nice, suspenseful story for fans of wizards and mystery.

Initially, readers may think this is a story about an ogre being thwarted by a band of plucky preteens. It is, however, far more interesting than that: a dual story, both of a mismatched stepfamily and of kids having magical adventures.<br />Caspar, Gwinny and Johnny are all aghast when their mother Sally marries a man named Jack. Jack (continuously called \\"The Ogre\\") is callous and resentful of his new wife's children, and he also brings two kids of his own to the stepfamily -- snooty Malcolm and obnoxious Douglas, who are equally miserable about their new stepsiblings.<br />Life takes a small twist when the Ogre gives the kids two chemistry sets. These are, the three kids find, not ordinary chemistry sets. They contain mysterious, magical (nontoxic) elements that can cause strange occurrances. They allow the kids to float through the air, switch bodies, bring toffee bars and dustballs to life, and become invisible. But things take an unexpected turn, and the five children must learn a little more about the Ogre.<br />In some ways, this book is reminiscent of Jones' \\"Fire and Hemlock,\\" where we have both a fantasy adventure and a coming-of-age-story. This one is about kids growing accustomed to their new stepsiblings, and their new stepfather. Though initially it's hard to find any worth in the Ogre, the reader sees eventually that he does have some niceness hidden under his crabby exterior. Malcolm and Douglas are the same; they seem like a pair of obnoxious brats at first, but band together with Caspar, Gwinny and Johnny on their magical adventures. At the same time, we have a charming fantasy story with purring pipes, litters of baby toffee bars, and one memorable scene where Malcolm turns several colors in a row.<br />The three protagonists are endearingly realistic: Caspar is the most mature of the three, and the one most likely to make good decisions. Gwinny is soft-hearted and a little more humorous, while Johnny is a slightly darker and more intense person. Douglas and Malcolm retain a sort of grudging alliance with the three, and the reader will begin liking them more as the book progresses. The Ogre is well-portrayed, from the POV of three resentful young children; mom Sally is sadly two-dimensional, but this is perhaps the only really weak spot.<br />A sweet little fantasy story, and one that fans of magic and humor will readily enjoy.le Johnny is a slightly darker and more intense person.

The face of literature changed forever with the publication of \\"The Hobbit,\\" the prequel novel to the epic fantasy \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" With the release of three blockbuster films based on that trilogy, new attention is also being paid to \\"The Hobbit.\\" While not the deepest or most epic of Tolkien's creations, this tale is enchantingly and expertly written, with a thoroughly sympathetic cast of characters and a delightful plot that intertwines deeply with \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"<br />Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit, a member of a race of small, large-eating, peaceful creatures, very much like humans, with hairy feet and a distrust of adventures. But Bilbo's life is unexpectedly turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf, with thirteen dwarves in tow. They eat Bilbo's food, take over his cozy hobbit-hole (a subterranean dwelling -- \\"Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort\\"), and generally make life difficult for him.<br />But Bilbo soon finds out why: these dwarves are on a mission to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, who slaughtered its inhabitants and stole their treasure. Now, led by Thorin Oakenshield, the dwarves intend to take back what is theirs -- and Gandalf wants Bilbo to come along. Bilbo doesn't particularly want to go, but the adventure appeals to a quirky, adventurous side of him. Before he knows what has happened, he is on a rollicking adventure filled with malevolent goblins, a degenerated creature with a magical Ring, Elves both friendly and unfriendly, enormous eagles, savage wolves (also called wargs), and giant carnivorous spiders. But even if Bilbo can get past these dangers, he must still deal with the malevolent Smaug in his mountain fortress. <br />Many people have fond memories of reading \\"The Hobbit\\" as children (including part of the LOTR movie cast). This is definitely a children's book in some ways, but most children can't pick up on the subtle character developments and the nuanced foreshadowing. \\"The Hobbit\\" is not merely an entertaining story or a delightful prequel, but also a masterful piece of fiction.<br />If nephew Frodo Baggins is the ultimate \\"little guy\\" hero, then Bilbo is the ultimate reluctant hero. Bilbo is almost perfectly happy in his respectably dull life, but his very small yearning for adventure is evident from the very beginning. Though he is not the sort of person that you would classify as being a hero, Bilbo grows gradually and subtlely in courage and ingenuity. Only on the very last pages does the reader realize just how much Bilbo has changed.<br />Gandalf is a more nebulous figure in this book than he is in LOTR, and displays much of the \\"crotchety gray wizard\\" archetype that he formed in fantasy literature. Thorin Oakenshield displays the endearing and annoying traits of dwarves, dating back to the Prose Edda: He's proud and sometimes a little obnoxious, but also fiercely loyal, honorable and extremely brave. The other dwarves are not featured as much individually (after all, there are twelve) but retain individual characteristics that never become jumbled or confused.<br />Tolkien's writing style is somewhat in keeping with a bedtime story (which this once was) and a children's story. He had apparently mastered a very rare gift, that of being able to address the reader without sounding cutesy or smug. The descriptions are very evocative, especially when he describes action scenes. The dialogue is enchantingly written, managing to be fairly realistic while never being boringly so.<br />Like \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" \\"The Hobbit\\" is influenced by mythology and a previous work of fiction. The goblins (later orcs) are somewhat reminicent of George MacDonald's goblins; as Tolkien read and enjoyed some of MacDonald's works, this is unsurprising. Additionally, the names of Gandalf and almost all the dwarves can be found in Norse legends. The impact is subtler than that in LOTR, presumably since Tolkien's children were too young to appreciate any influences.<br />\\"The Hobbit\\" remains a classic that can be read and enjoyed by children and adults alike, possibly even more enjoyable now than when it was first written. Before you read \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" be sure to check out its enchanting prequel.	2002-05-29

It's more than slightly staggering to consider the epic fantasy &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; to be the tail end of Tolkien's invented history. The &quot;Bible&quot; of Middle-Earth, the &quot;Silmarillion&quot; stretches from the beginning of time to the departure of the Elves from Middle-Earth.<br />A complete summary is impossible, because the book spans millennia and has one earth-shattering event after another. But it includes the creation of Tolkien's invented pantheons of angelic beings under Eru Iluvatar, also known as God; how they sang the world into being; the creation of Elves, Men, and Dwarves (hobbits are, I think, not really covered); the legendary love story of Beren and Luthien, a mortal Man and an Elf maiden who gives up her immortality for the man she loves; the demonic Morgoth and Sauron; Elves of just about any kind -- bad, mad, dangerous, good, sweet, brave, and so forth; the Rings of Power; the Two Trees that made the sun and moon; and finally the quest of the Ringbearer, Frodo Baggins.<br />Many old favorites will pop up over the course of the book, such as Elrond, Galadriel, Gandalf, and so on. Fans of Elves will find plenty to feed their hunger; if you are fond of Hobbits or Dwarves, you will not find as much here. For those, you should check some of the other &quot;lost&quot; books of prior writings. It will also answer some questions that &quot;Hobbit&quot; and LOTR may raise, when references to long-ago incidents and people are made.<br />Be forewarned: The writing style of Silmarillion is more akin to the Eddas, the Bible, or the Mabinogian than to LOTR. It's more formal and archaic in tone, Tolkien did not get as &quot;into&quot; the heads of his characters in Silmarillion as he did in LOTR, and there is no central character. Needless to say, this is necessary as a more in-depth approach would have taken centuries to write, let alone perfect. If readers can bypass the automatic dislike of more formal prose, they will find enchanting stories and a less evocative but very intriguing writing style. This style strongly leans on the Eddas, collections of story and song that were unearthed and translated long ago. Though obviously not as well-known as LOTR, it is clear that these collections helped influence the Silmarillion.<br />It's evident, while reading this, that Tolkien's passion for his invented history.

Most second books sort of meander, a bridge between book one and book three. In this case, it alters the focus and the knowledge from the first book.<br />Imrhien has regained her voice and her face, but her memory is still a blank. She has also fallen in love with the Dainnan warrior Thorn. The old carlin Maeve One-Eye assists the young woman in trying to find out who she was and why she was attacked at some time by an unseelie wight. So she disguises Imrhien as a beautiful and wealthy lady of the distant Isles of the Sorrows, and gives her a new name: Rohain of the Sorrows.<br />Rohain arrives at the court of the King-Emperor, and fits badly into the sumptuous court, with all its unspoken rules and customs (not to mention \\"slingua,\\" a bizarre little courtly language of their own). When an old friend is accused of treachery, Rohain tries to stand up for him in front of the King-Emperor -- only to find that he is the key to her happiness, Thorn. But that happiness is short-lived, when unseelie attacks begin to batter the court. An evil wizard's niece with a silver tongue tries to kill Rohain, Huon the Hunter and his Wild Hunt, and a shattering earthquake. Rohain knows that she is the target. And to know why, she must remember the past that was stolen from her: her name, her family, her life, and the beautiful, horrible events that changed Erith forever...<br />In my review for the first Bitterbynde trilogy, I commented that it could not be rightly called an epic. That changes in this book, about two-thirds through. As before, her writing is highly descriptive, highly evocative in its use of poetic words. She doesn't spare the lush descriptions of surroundings, much in the manner of Patricia McKillip. At the same time, this book has more of a satirical side than \\"Ill-Made Mute,\\" as Dart-Thornton cleverly pokes at the weird bits of a medieval court, the needless customs, and the occasional prod at fashion at the expense of comfort.<br />I was initially afraid that Rohain (previously Imrhien, but in this book she takes on two other names and then remembers her real one) would be less interesting when she regained her beauty and her voice. This is not so -- in fact, Rohain may be even more interesting now that we see her strength and attempts to stay afloat in a place where a single malicious word could puncture her pretense. There is the strong-silent Thorn, who appears in a substantially different slot in the world than he did before, and the pleasant, robust Sianadh, whose scenes with Thorn and Rohain are pure fun. And among the new characters are Viviana, a rather fragile but ultimately resolute and loyal maid to Rohain; Daniella, a chattery noblewoman whose light tongue and odd clothes hide a malicious soul; the charming bard who befriends Rohain; and a hideous sprite called Yallery Green.<br />If there are any flaws, it is that Dart-Thornton seems absolutely in love with clothing, and so virtually every item of clothing is described right down to its frogging and embroidery. This is such a small one that you probably won't notice after a while; and some of her descriptions of clothing (like a particularly weird outfit of Daniella's near the beginning) are unusually fun.<br />As before, there are large amounts of lore, legend and myth, most of it Celtic but with a dash of Teutonic as well (in the form of the \\"duergar\\"). In this area, Dart-Thornton excels especially. Rohain's background is almost instantly recognizable, but the author weaves a web of magic and myth around the events of a familiar legend, to which Rohain is the pivot. In this area, she also introduces us to the Faeran, who are probably the best elves I've ever read about, excepting Tolkien's. Virtually no other author has so aptly captured the mystery and magic of the Fair Folk and their realm, without making them too earthy or too distant.<br/>Anyone who loves a beautifully written story full of magic and amazing characters will find nothing disappointing in the second Bitterbynde book. Now there's still the wait for book three...r />Anyone who loves a beautifully written story full of magic and amazing characters will find nothing disappointing in the second Bitterbynde book.

If the second book of a series tends to be the weakest, the last is the most likely to disappoint. Here, the trilogy gets even more amazing.<br />In the aftermath of Heir of Sea and Fire, Raederle and Morgan have been reunited in Anuin, where the dead are still roaming around, Deth has vanished, and Raederle is afraid to marry Morgan because of her fears of her own strange ancestry. Morgan brings a shipful of wraiths to his home of Hed, and confronts the family who sees that he is no longer as he once was.<br />And the lands of An are teetering on the edge of war, with shapechangers creeping through the land and the sinister Ghisteslwchlohm somehow at the middle of it. \\"There are men in it who have already died, who are still fighting, with their bodies possessed by nothing human.\\" So Morgan and Raederle must go on the ultimate mission -- a mission that will take them to the heart and history of their world, the secret of the shape-changers and what they are, and what Morgan's secret destiny is...<br />McKillip doesn't falter for a moment in this book, the third of the series; she's never written doorstopper epics, but her books are some of the most outstanding fantasy in print. Her writing evolved even over the course of the trilogy, becoming more introspective and more spellbinding in its descriptions. She gives you only a hint of how something looks, but every sense about how it feels and how it is perceived by the characters.<br />Morgan and Raederle have both grown from the beginnings of their initial books. Morgan is now a more tormented, multidimensional person than the guy who hid a crown under his bed and got sour milk dumped on his head. He feels the weight of An on his shoulders, and experiences equal determination and fear. Raederle has also changed, since finding out about her mixed heritage and why she has her mysterious powers. In a way, this knowledge about her past balances out with Morgan's knowledge about his future destiny. She's not the usual fantasy girlfriend whose sole purpose is to provide the hero with some romance, but a strong and independent female character who acts as a vital part of the storyline.<br />The supporting characters are also amazing: Deth is his usual ambiguous self, where you can't be sure if he's working for or against Morgan. Rood is still delightful, but transformed into a more serious character. And we see more of Raederle's quirky father Mathom, Morgan's sister Tristan and brother Eliard, and various other faces from the past two books.<br />This is one of the few fantasy stories where you simply can't guess what is ahead. Questions and hints laid out in the previous two books are followed up on, and pretty much no threads are left dangling. You won't guess beforehand what Morgan's destiny is or what the shapechangers were, or even how they can be dealt with. You won't know what Deth's plans are until he reveals them, or whether he's a villain or a hero. As in real life, the answers are not laid on the table for everyone to see; what you see is not necessarily what is real, and what the hero thinks about a person is not necessarily what is true.<br />Unlike most fantasies, this book is not padded for extra length, given an enormous cast of characters or an overly complicated system of kingdoms and hierarchies. There are no stereotypical elements like elves, dwarves, gray-bearded wizards, or Dark Lords; only shapechangers and human beings. McKillip's magic is not the slam-bang-whizz-sparks-of-light type, but a subtle, strange, powerful kind.<br />The climax to one of the best fantasy stories since Lord of the Rings, and one of the best out there. A must-read.y, this knowledge about her past balances out with Morgan's knowledge about his future destiny.

And we see more of Raederle's quirky father Mathom, Morgan's sister Tristan and brother Eliard, and various other faces from the past two books. <br />This is one of the few fantasy stories where you simply can't guess what is ahead. Questions and hints laid out in the previous two books are followed up on, and pretty much no threads are left dangling. You won't guess beforehand what Morgan's destiny is or what the shapechangers were, or even how they can be dealt with. You won't know what Deth's plans are until he reveals them, or whether he's a villain or a hero. As in real life, the answers are not laid on the table for everyone to see; what you see is not necessarily what is real, and what the hero thinks about a person is not necessarily what is true.<br />Unlike most fantasies, this book is not padded for extra length, given an enormous cast of characters or an overly complicated system of kingdoms and hierarchies. There are no stereotypical elements like elves, dwarves, gray-bearded wizards, or Dark Lords; only shapechangers and human beings. McKillip's magic is not the slam-bang-whizz-sparks-of-light type, but a subtle, strange, powerful kind.<br />The climax to one of the best fantasy stories since Lord of the Rings, and one of the best out there. A must-read.	2002-05-22
1534917:US	50881246	RTCT8RTNI5NY1	0141310685	798089094	Westmark (The Westmark Trilogy)	Books	4	11	12	N	N	History and ethics	Lloyd Alexander strays from his more popular fantasy adventures into a historical drama, with tinges of political thriller and, of course, a subtle coming-of-age for several characters.<br />Theo is a \\"printer's devil,\\" the assistant to a small printer in the fictional country of Westmark; Westmark is becoming increasingly dictatorial, since the mysterious death of the young princess drove the king into depression and illness. Now the power-hungry first minister Cabbarus uses the king as a puppet. None of this is relevent to Theo until soldiers destroy the press, and he becomes a fugitive from the law.<br />He flees and accompanies Count Las Bombas and Musket, a jolly charlatan and a formidable dwarf. They are rapidly joined by Mickle, a talented street urchin whom Theo develops feelings for. But he can't bear the dishonesty of a charlatan's lifestyle, and so flees into a group of revolutionaries led by the charming Florian. Together, they will have face the treacherous Cabbarus, and the mysteries of the past.<br />Westmark is a good book, with a plausible set-up, an intriguing hero and supporting characters, and a series of moral questions that are brought up in a thought-provoking manner. Is it acceptable to steal and lie if it will result in something good, or if the person being lied to or robbed is evil himself? Theo wrestles with these questions over the course of the book, and raises them for the readers as well.<br />The conscientious and endearing hero Theo is surrounded by a colorful cast. There is the bright, mysterious urchin Mickle, pleasantly dishonest Las Bombas, fiery Musket, charming anti-monarchist Florian and his band of loyal \\"children,\\" the grim Dr. Torrens who only wants to help his king, and the evil plotter Cabbarus.<br />The main flaws is a sometimes meandering storyline, and a romance that seems to develop a little too quickly with too little personal interaction. In addition to this, I felt that the book could have benefited from a longer and more developed storyline; it rushed by too fast. However, Alexander's command of language and dialogue are as expert as ever, and some of his trademarked characters (the overserious adolescent hero, the sharp-tongued love interest, the eloquent charmer) are very much present.<br />A good piece of historical fiction, and definitely one for adults and young adults who think.and more developed storyline; it rushed by too fast.

1536803:US	50881246	R3URFGZJ1B9G7C	0812505182	465915454	The Magic of Recluce (Recluce series, Book 1)	Books	2	81	105	N	N	"Holy cheeze, Batman!"	The Recluse series seems to be one of those fantasy serieses that you either loathe or love. I found the first book \\"Magic of Recluse\\" to be moderately entertaining, if overlong and full of annoying little quirks.<br />The hero, Lerris, is bored. In general. Living on the hyper-ordered isle of Recluse is not the best enviroment for a talented young man who wants a little more variety in his life. The dictatorial Masters insist on perfect order, as Order is the only way to defeat destructive Chaos -- and in their eyes, boredom and lack of direction are prime openings for future chaos. After a brief stint as a woodworker, Lerris is given a choice: either be exiled from Recluse, or the dangergeld, a complex jaunt in the outside world that allows him to learn more about it. He chooses the dangergeld, and trains for a while under the masters. Two of the people he meets are Krystal, a giggling swordmaster, and Tamra, a very proud man-hater.<br />Lerris sets out to learn more, with only his pony as his companion. Along the way, he encounters the gray wizard Justen (normally they come either as black/good, or white/bad). As he becomes enmeshed in the local politics and is hounded by whitecloaks (and does more woodworking), he learns that a white wizard named Antonin is trying to spread chaos for his own gain.<br />I wanted to enjoy this book, but found myself rolling my eyes too often. Modesitt has an intriguing idea concerning magic, order and chaos, but he often seems to be a little confused about how it could work. (One wonders if he had it plotted out when he began) It's also nice to finally find a book series that does not have a parade of ripoff Tolkien creations, but bothers to just add some \\"differentness\\" to human cultures, even if they are mildly generic in their inception. I also found it very amusing that Modesitt took the care to explain why Recluse and the surrounding lands are living in a medieval enviroment, rather than having more modern technology.<br />The hero, Lerris, is a nice piece of work. A bored teen is hardly a new idea, but Modesitt manages to make him sympathetic by emphasizing the stifling nature of Recluse's culture, not being too ham-handed as he does so. And while Lerris is somewhat short-sighted and self-pitying at the beginning, he is no longer at the end of the book. The surrounding characters, except for the crabby woodworker and Justen, are pretty 2-D. There is some mild hormone-related incidents, including a bunch of hookers beckoning to Lerris and a friend, but this book would be fine for young adults.<br />One annoying detail is sound effects. \\"Cheezy\\" is the best way to describe these; fans of the old Batman TV series will probably be giggling whenever Modesitt inserts one of his sound effects. He doesn't seem to believe that the readers will be able to imagine for themselves what creaking floorboards, whinnying horses, and the sound of clattering mugs sound like. The sound effects aren't even accurate. I have never heard thunder \\"thrum,\\" horses \\"whee...ee,\\" or a door \\"itttcccchhh.\\" The repetition will also annoy some people, as horses don't \\"whee...ee\\" just once, but dozens of times.<br />Another annoying detail is that Modesitt doesn't bother to describe the fight scenes. He gives us a string of sound-effects, and then refers to one of the people involved dying. It's very hard to visualize, which is doubly odd because of the effort expended giving us the sound effects. One of the last pages also has the weirdest, most obliquely-written love scene I have ever read. I literally did not know what was happening until I had read it several times. (What am I supposed to think when I read about \\"her hands didn't stop at my fingertips\\"?)<br />Was a nice light read, but could have been much better if someone had attacked it with editing shears.e hero, Lerris, is a nice piece of work.

Clarke does a good job of sapping the stiffness from old legends and making it palatable to the modern reader.<br />The story begins with the story of Gahmuret, who goes off on a Crusade and then returns to Britain, marrying two women along the way -- a Moorish queen and a Welsh queen. He's killed shortly after the birth of his son Parzival, and the shock of his death drives his Welsh widow mad. She secludes herself in the woods with her son, trying to keep him sheltered away from the world that might make him a warrior knight.<br /><br />Years pass, and Parzival accidently encounters three knights on the road. Immediately he becomes obsessed with being a knight, and despite his mother's protests, he leaves to become one. By training and assistance, he does become a knight and marries the beautiful queen Blanchefleur. But before he arrives at King Arthur's court, Parzival comes to a magical castle where he is expected to ask the king a question. His failure to do so drives him away from God and into a desperate quest for redemption.<br />Alongside Parzival's quest, we also have the adventures of Sir Gawain, who seems to develop a crush on any mildly pretty lady he comes across. He becomes enamored of a very proud and obnoxious woman, who is entrapped in the dark magic of an evil sorcerer.<br />This is a nice book. It isn't perfect; with the exception of Gawain and Parzival, the characters are pretty two-dimensional, especially Kei, who is obnoxious for no reason that anyone can really explain. Other characters, like the pig-faced sorceress Cundrie, seem to exist for no other reason than to tell Parzival and Gawain things. Fans of the usual Camelot love triangle will be disappointed, while people who dislike the much-rehashed love story will probably enjoy reading some Camelot-related material that hasn't been done to death.<br />The writing style and dialogue are formal but not incomprehensible; Clarke does a good job of giving us a view inside the heads of the lead two characters. The plot itself is fairly straightforward, with some sudden twists and turns that might confuse people unfamiliar with the original legends. Readers may need to backpedal a few times.<br />This book would probably be a good retelling for teens and adults alike; it has some dirty content that the YA and juvenile retelling doesn't have, such as Gawain almost being seduced by a girl (they're in bed and they kiss and snuggle, but nothing more), and references to the \\"activities\\" of Gahmuret and his two wives, and briefly of Parzival and Condwiramurs. In addition, there are some very gruesome scenes, such as Parzival's maddened, deteriorated cousin who totes around the head of her dead lover.<br />A good retelling for any who enjoyed Parzival's Page, or Katherine Paterson's retelling. Or for anyone in the mood for some freshly-told Arthurian stories.l probably enjoy reading some Camelot-related material that hasn't been done to death.<br />The writing style and dialogue are formal but not incomprehensible; Clarke does a good job of giving us a view inside the heads of the lead two characters.

Fresh off of \\"Cockatrice Boys,\\" I picked up \\"Whispering Mountain\\" with a vague sense of unease. Too often fantasies with Celtic backdrops have become stale and repetitive, but Aiken's wry humor and delightful use of characterizations make this a rare treasure.<br />In the little Welsh town of Pennygaff, Owen has come to live with his crotchety, chilly grandfather after his mother's death. He is chased and bullied by the other, larger boys; his only friend is the odd but kind girl Arabis and her dreamy poet father, Tom Dando. In fact, Owen trusts Arabis enough to tell her a secret: His grandfather has unearthed what may be the legendary golden Harp of Teirtu. The ruthless, gold-obsessed Lord Malyn soon asks the grandfather to hand over the harp, but the old man refuses.<br />When Owen plans to run away from his grandfather, he end up abducted by a pair of none-too-swift criminals hired by Lord Malyn. Unexpectedly rescued by Arabis, Owen finds himself being blamed for the theft of the harp. He ends up in a bewildering adventure full of subterranean dwarves, oddly-speaking foreigners, sneaky and none-too-swift criminals, and the missing Prince of Wales.<br />Owen is sympathetic by being a \\"Charlie Brown\\" hero. As the book opens, we see him being pursued by a bunch of bullies; he is also near-sighted, meek, and fears being a burden on his grandfather. Arabis is reminiscent of a Lloyd Alexander heroine, with her sharp mind and slightly out-of-the-ordinary ways. She is a fascinating character, who doesn't so much as blink at the idea of healing enormous numbers of underground dwarves. (And she has her bird ride around on her head, an extra quirk that makes her even more intriguing) Tom Dando is a sweet and poignant character, who often lapses out of the real world as he writes poetry; Lord Malyn is relentlessly evil, while the Seljuk of Rum is a quirky, instantly sympathetic character.<br />The writing is snappy and well-paced, and the dialogue is interspersed with delightful bits of Welsh language. There's a slightly archaic feel to it, as if it takes place in a time far removed from our own, though it's not actually too far back in time. Aiken displays a stunning sense of atmosphere, whether it's the pleasantly dull town, sinister castle, or strange underground caverns.<br />On a quality basis, this book lags behind its content. My copy had a couple of lines missing from a crucial conversation, and the paper was of poor quality. This is a problem with several of the Starscape  reprints, but the previous books I purchased didn't have sections of the text missing.

Her life is changed when an eerily beautiful young man named Indigo comes into the shop, trying to sell a long pointed flute to Mr. Papas. And he wants gold for the fluted horn -- lots of gold. Mr. Papas can't give him all the gold he wants immediately, and so Indigo puts the offer on hold.<br />The music of the horn follows Joey throughout her day. That night, she finds herself in a near-idyllic land called Shei'rah. In it live water spirits, kindly satyrs, tiny dragons -- and near-immortal unicorns called the Eldest. Except the Eldest are becoming blind, as an unknown affliction robs them of their sight. Joey travels from one world to the other, but begins to see flaws and problems in Shei'rah, and learns more about the mysterious Indigo and what he is doing.<br />This is a nice story, not the best or the deepest (since parts of it are obvious from the very start, such as what Abuelita is going to do), but very well-written and true to life as a fantasy book can get. It raises some good questions as well: Is it better to be good and pure, or to have human choice? Is it better to believe a beautiful lie than an ugly truth? Beagle handles these questions delicately and without ham-handedness. He also adds a few extra dimensions to previous creatures like satyrs and pheonixes, by also giving them different names than we do.<br />Among the introspective scenes is Joey and Indigo meeting a former unicorn who lives as a homeless human in our world; Beagle gives us a view of both sides of the issue, both what Indigo feels and what Joey feels when they see her. And the blindness symbolism is so subtle I didn't notice it at first.<br />Joey herself initially seems like she'll be the usual disaffected loner teen. But as she spends time among the Eldest and with Indigo, we see her gradually maturing in personality. It's not an easy transition, but enjoyable to watch. Most of the Eldest except for Indigo and the kiddie unicorn don't have much personality; they're ancient, wise, and good, and there isn't much more to them than that. Abuelita is delightfully spicy in personality, the kindly and wiser-than-you'd-expect grandmother we'd all love to have, as is the crotchety, sharp Mr. Papas (who may be my favorite character in the book). Ko is a fun sidekick, even if we take a long time to know just where in life he is; the water creature really could have used a purpose in the plot, since she really seemed like page filler. Indigo is the weirdest and most unique; his motives are cloudy and his demeanor is unusually cynical, but he becomes sympathetic to the reader nevertheless.<br />Finally, Robert Rodrieguez does an amazing job with the illustrations. Both realistic and dreamy, they fit the action in the book perfectly. And the Eldest, the way he draws them, are subtlely different from the usual visions of unicorns (especially those HUGE eyes).<br />A charming little coming-of-age story, and one that fans of &quot;Last Unicorn&quot; may enjoy.o feels and what Joey feels when they see her.

Tolkien's epic saga, the fantasy that created the genre as we know it today. Now, as the blockbuster movie adaptation is one-third over, evidenced by Viggo Mortenson on the book's cover, waves of new readers are checking out what is yet to come.<br />The story opens where \\"Two Towers\\" left off. Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives.  And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.<br />In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?<br />Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel. With his own experiences in war, Tolkien shows that in a struggle against evil, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.<br />Frodo is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down by the pressure of the Ring, to the point where he seems to be only a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Yet these actions make chilling sense, even when Frodo recovers his self-control only a moment later. It's a devastating demonstration of the hold the Ring has on him; he tries to resist it while knowing that he's falling too far into its grasp. When he lapses into depression and nihilism, the reader will start wondering if he can actually give it up.<br />Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves. This book has him chasing orcs with Sting, carrying Frodo physically through Mordor, fending off Gollum, and acting as the ultimate pillar of strength for his crumbling friend right to Mount Doom. Merry and Pippin have changed as well; Merry is exposed firsthand to the horrifying consequences of war, and has a hand in destroying one of the most evil entities in the world. Pippin's adventures are tame compared to those of his friends (possibly because he's still an adolescent), but we see him moving past his initial flakiness in an effort to be a serious warrior against Sauron. Gandalf's true nature is glimpsed yet again, but in a subtler manner. Aragorn breaks completely from the mold of rugged ranger and into the new status as a king, leading armies (both living and dead) without flinching. Legolas and Gimli assist as well; their friendship grows deeper, even as Legolas falls completely in love with the sea. Gollum's degenerate journey remains intertwined with Frodo's, even though he betrayed the hobbits in the previous book; and the icily passionate war-maiden Eowyn affects the War of the Ring in a stunning way that nobody could have predicted.<br />This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Aside from Frodo's emotional deterioration, we also have Merry becoming almost catatonic after the battle with the Witch King, and Denethor's descent into suicidal madness. There is a lot less humor, though it is still there: Pippin and Merry both thinking about food, Gandalf's reaction when Pippin pledges his sword to Denethor, some choice witty comments of Frodo's in the last chapters, and Gimli's half-joking threats to axe Eomer if Eomer doesn't consider Galadriel the most beautiful woman in the world.<br />Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Aragorn calling the dead, Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, the literally earth-shattering climax, and of course the Havens scene.<br />The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. I also advise readers to check out \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of LOTR can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following LOTR.<br />It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants.

He answers an ad requesting a Royal Wizard in the kingdom of Yurt, where the old wizard has just retired. When Daimbert arrives, at first he thinks that the worst problem he'll have is having to perform magic that he doesn't know, due to his skipping classes. He meets the weakened King Haimeric, the amazingly holy chaplain, the young queen, the flirtatious youthful queen's aunt Lady Maria, the king's sullen-looking nephew Dominic, and various other characters. On the surface, all seems fine, except for Daimbert's problems installing telephones.<br />However, something is rotten in the state of Yurt. Daimbert finds that he is not the only source of magic in the castle -- someone or something is causing the king to grow weaker and weaker. When he asks the old Royal Wizard about the problems, the only thing the old man will say is that no one can go into the north tower. Daimbert must unravel the mystery, and find who is responsible for all these problems. But can a class-skipping young wizard face evil and win? Hopefully!<br />C. Dale Brittain adds a little spice and flavor to the usual wizards and medieval settings. There are no strained attempts to make this tale ultra-different, but rather Brittain simply lets it flow. We have kings, wizards, demons, courtiers, and political plotting. Yet the plotline never becomes bogged down or too serious.<br />Humor in this book is never blatant or overdone, eliciting chuckles rather than belly laughs. I loved Daimbert dyeing his beard gray and buying the threadbare red-and-black top, writhing when the constable announced that they wouldn't expect telephone magic for at least a few weeks, and noting that his \\"Christmas suit\\" is ruined after slaying a dragon. It's wry and understated, but very realistic. Readers could definitely imagine someone thinking this way.<br />Daimbert is a delightful character. He's not flawless, or even very skilled, but his brainpower and niceness overcome the fact that he's not too good at wizardry. The supporting characters are a little less defined, but all are great, especially aging (sometimes NON-aging) ingenue Lady Maria, the solemn chaplain (who is as likeable as Daimbert in a very different way), and the ex-Royal Wizard, who is the sort of crotchety, capable wizard that everyone likes.<br />Descriptions are pretty good, evocative when describing action but never overdone. The dialogue is also realistic; too many fantasy books take themselves too seriously, resulting in silly melodramatic language, but this book is full of characters who talk like real people. The conversation with the demon is especially well-done, as is Daimbert's debate with the chaplain.<br />...

Tolkien, this is a must-have for any fan of Lord of the Rings.  It combines several previous publications into one longer book, including &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot; and &quot;Father Giles of Ham.&quot;<br />It begins with an essay by noted fantasy writer Peter Beagle, who also wrote the screenplay for the animated LOTR movie eons and eons ago. &quot;The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son&quot; is radically different from Tolkien's more popular works, in that it is more of a play and less of a short story. It will probably appeal to fewer, given its obscure historical context. &quot;Farmer Giles&quot; is about a rather unusual farmer called on to deal with a rather unusual dragon; this is definitely a light, fluffy, funny story. &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; and &quot;On Fairy Stories&quot; are more for the analytical thinkers among Tolkien's fans. &quot;Leaf&quot; is something of a glimpse into Tolkien's own soul, concerning his work and his own mortality. &quot;Fairy Stories,&quot; on the other hand, is one of the best-known essays on fantasy works and should be shoved in the face of anyone who denies fantasy's literary worth.<br />We then lapse into entirely different material. There is a long poem called &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil,&quot; written in the style and meter of his songs about himself in LOTR, when he meets the hobbits. It explains a little more about the hearty Maia and his wife Goldberry, as does the second of the poems, &quot;Bombadil Goes Boating.&quot; I didn't understand the beautifully written &quot;Errantry&quot; very well; but I did think that the catchy &quot;Princess Mee&quot; was cute, about a little elf princess dancing with her reflection. &quot;The Man in the Moon Came Down Too Soon&quot; is written in a very different style from the similarly titled &quot;Stayed Up,&quot; and definitely in a less merry style. There is also the entertaining &quot;Perry the Winkle&quot; and the utterly creepy &quot;Mewlips,&quot; and the amusingly jerky &quot;Cat.&quot; Also the eerie, beautiful &quot;Sea Bell,&quot; which seems almost like a dream.<br />LOTR fans will recognize some of these poems: &quot;The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late,&quot; which fans of LOTR will recognize as the song that Frodo sings in an inn. &quot;Stone Troll&quot;, which Sam sang to entertain the others. &quot;Oliphaunt,&quot; an old rhyme about certain enormous pachyderms. Others are reminiscent of Middle-Earth: &quot;Fastitocalon,&quot; a poem about a creature in the sea; &quot;Shadow Bride,&quot; which is reminiscent of Beren and Luthien; &quot;The Hoard,&quot; about a massive amount of gold that brings no joy to its owners; and finally &quot;The Last Ship,&quot; a tale about a beautiful human girl who is invited by Elves to follow them over the sea.<br />For unsurpassable prose, nonfiction and poetry, this is where to find the lesser-known gems by J.R.R.

One of the most enigmatic and mysterious characters of Arthurian legend is Arthur's illegitimate son, Mordred. Unfortunately, he is also one of the least explored. In a market flooded with preachy, badly-written Arthuriana, \\"I Am Mordred\\" shines like a rare, dark gem.<br />The book opens with King Arthur sadly setting dozens of newborn babies adrift on the ocean. Several years later, we see a young boy living peacefully with a fisherman and his wife. Their happy lives are interrupted when a woman named Nyneve rides in to bring Mordred back to his biological family, the royal family of Lothian. However, they are not pleased to see him.<br />He soon finds out why: he is the product of incest between King Arthur and his half-sister Morgause, and is destined to kill his father someday. Shocked by this, Mordred goes to Camelot and soon begins craving his father's love and acceptance. He is also terrified of the prophecy that he will kill Arthur, and does everything he can to fight it. But can he fight his destiny, or only fulfil it?<br />This is probably the best book I've read by Nancy Springer, a dark, beautiful, suspenseful and very sad novel. It's very rare to find an inspired Arthurian novel with any new material, but she pulls it off by creating a new Mordred -- this is not the monster who wants to kill Arthur for no reason, but a confused young man who only wants to be loved by his father, while knowing he is doomed to destroy him.<br />One of the primary themes is whether a person is \\"born bad\\"; Mordred has, in his lifetime, done nothing wrong. Yet he is treated as a pariah by the people around him. His loneliness is broken only by Arthur and by Mordred's dog, Gull. While traditional Arthurian legends seem to be based around the idea of Mordred being evil because of his incestuous conception, Springer simply breaks those ideas apart. Nobody is simply born to be evil. Destiny and fate are some of the items that are also explored: Mordred seeks a way to avoid fulfilling the prophecy, but risks fulfilling it through avoidance.<br />Mordred is an incredibly appealing character. He's merely a shy, introspective teenager who has been shunned by his relatives and by others in Camelot. His desperation is present on almost every page, as is his isolation, but Springer makes it sympathetic. Nobody will want to say \\"just shut up and quit whining\\"; rather, they'll be hoping that Mordred can somehow beat the prophecy, while knowing that he's all but certain to fail. Arthur is a good supporting character, surprisingly complex. Springer portrays him as an essentially good man who committed a terrible crime in an effort to save himself and his kingdom, and who regrets it. He wants to love Mordred as Mordred wants to be loved, but is as afraid of the prophecy as Mordred is.<br />Springer's writing is descriptive and evocative; it's a little flowery, but not too flowery. She has an excellent sense of buildup and suspense, that grows as the book progresses. The first and last chapters are written in third-person style, which may seem like a jolt when most of the book is written from Mordred's perspective; however, it becomes clear why this is necessary.<br />I would not advise this book for younger children. There's no objectionable content in it, but a great deal of focus on incest and the social stigmas attached to children born of it. The overall storyline is rather dark and occasionally violent, and Mordred's perpetual struggle against fate is a very psychologically intense storyline that may upset smaller children. Mature 9-12 kids and all teens ought to be able to handle this, and all the subtle undertones and nuances.<br />You'll be hard-pressed to find a more beautiful and original Arthurian book published in recent years. \\"I Am Mordred\\" is an amazing addition to anyone's library, whether they are a fan of Camelot or not.illing the prophecy, but risks fulfilling it through avoidance. <br />Mordred is an incredibly appealing character.

It can only be speculated why one of Tony Kornheiser's books is out of print, and another is currently a \\"special order\\" item. A sports/humor writer for the Washington Post, he is an underrated gem among humorous writers. I only enjoy Dave Barry more.<br />In this book (whose cover and title spoof a Dennis Rodman autobio, and whom he roundly flogs on the book's pages) Kornheiser contemplates male pattern baldness and whether the cure is worse than the affliction; Michael Jordan cologne (\\"if you give the average person a sheet of paper and instructions to list what he thinks of when he thinks of Michael Jordan, 'smells good' would end up No. 97, right after 'rabbinical student'\\"); dogs; different kinds of cars; foreign money; how to have a nice lawn; exhuming presidents and whether this is a new trend; Jose Lind, who was arrested without pants or underwear; politically correct food; and his crazy family, which includes a sociopath nephew, a newly single brother, an alcoholic uncle, and an eightysomething father who's dating \\"Tiffany,\\" who doesn't know who \\"Kennedy\\" was and tells people about her past lives.<br />There are a few more somber columns in this collection, such as the one about his aging uncle; there is also the occasional lapse into literal poetry, such as a rhymed eulogy to Dr. Seuss and a poem about Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan (that one is a real hoot!). But overall it has the flavor of a Jewish Dave Barry (who gives Kornheiser a highly entertaining back cover quote).<br />Fans of Barry will find the same sort of rational insanity in Kornheiser's work, and some of the same observations through a different lens. (Like being hit by the flu) It's a hilarious collection of funny columns by a funny writer. Someone bring it back into print, and fast.	2002-05-11
1548172:US	50881246	R2XNOJFIOGCG07	0345442636	290156728	The Silent Gondoliers	Books	3	20	24	N	N	Cute	I am one of the handful of people who haven't yet read \\"The Princess Bride,\\" so I can't comment on how this compares to that book. However, this was an entertaining little tale and a cute fable.<br />Everyone once knew that the gondoliers of Venice were the best singers in the world -- so amazing, in fact, that the great Enrico Caruso was overwhelmed when he heard them singing. One talented young gondolier with a \\"goony\\" smile, Luigi, is incredibly skilled as a gondolier and wins the heart of the girl he adores. But when he tries to sing, chaos reigns. People pelt him with vegetables and dead fish, even when he isn't singing.<br />Out of necessity, poor Luigi is drummed out of the gondoliers. His girlfriend dumps him, and he ends up washing dishes in a tavern with only his dreams to sustain him. Can Luigi overcome his terrible singing voice and realize his dreams?<br />This is a cute little story, though \\"fable\\" might be the wrong description for it because there is no firmly-defined lesson in it. Is it the special-rubbing-off line? Never give up on your dreams? Be an insane optimist? I never really figured it out. The outlines of it are rather uneven, especially the entire chapter devoted to the history of surfing. This might work in a book three or four times \\"Gondoliers\\"'s length, but in a story this short it merely feels awkward. And for the record, the translation of \\"pizza\\" is not \\"pizza,\\" but \\"pie.\\"<br />Nevertheless, Luigi is a sweetie, with his goony smile and obsessions with being a gondolier. The reader really does want him to succeed, and boos enthusiastically at the unsympathetic The Great and the aptly named \\"John the Bastard.\\" The line drawings add a nice touch, very pretty in most cases. And the author manages to make Venice sound like one of the loveliest places in the world.<br />A nice little book, good for passing twenty minutes on a rainy day.	2002-05-11

I recall being puzzled by her behavior. After reading this book, I think I know why. In all honesty, I felt rather embarrassed to be reading this book.<br />The book chronicles her life, from a not-so-innocent girlhood in the South to an up-and-down movie career, and ending right around the demise of her self-titled show \\"Cybill.\\" She happily breaks all the rules set down in her girlhood, and goes through a long list of emotional situations ranging from heartbreak to love to happiness to sadness. It follows her through three kids, a few marriages, oodles of movies, two TV shows, and a seemingly endless string of lovers.<br />Oh gosh, where to begin? Despite her comments near the beginning that she couldn't \\"tell it all,\\" there's a pretty honest feel to it all. Cybill seems unafraid to reveal some of her uglier or more humiliating moments, her personal traumas (like the admission of infidelity from her ex), and her professional disappointments, as well as all the people she's ticked off. (Well, if not all of them, then most, I think) At times, however, you wonder what the other side of the story is, and whether the full story is being told.<br />What bothered me was Cybill's continuous focus on her love life and how many men she slept with, and how, and where, and why. First, I find the details embarrassing, as is her blithe attitude to them. Second, it seems that this -- and not her acting career -- is the focus of the book. Whenever Cybill meets a man in this book, married or single, of whatever age, she always seems to be summing him up on a sexual level: whether or not she's attracted to him, what she did/didn't do with him. From her girlhood onward, virtually everything revolves around the men she's sleeping with and whatever effects it had on her life. I find this attitude not liberated, but obsessive. Is Cybill's life no more than the sum of her affairs?<br />She also uses this book as something of a soapbox for her views on sexuality, ideas about chastity, homosexuality, abortion, and cohabitation. (Add this to her spicier anecdotes about some affairs, and you get the idea that this is not a book kids should read) These views got no response at all from me - whatever response she hoped to get, disapproval or delight, she didn't get it. My response was overall, \\"Yeah, uh-huh, whatever.\\"<br />Admittedly, the book is hilariously written; despite the ghostwriter who undoubtedly did a lot of the work, there's something of a sharp tang to it that is probably Cybill's doing. When she shifts focus from her love life to her career, we get a great look inside the nasty, fickle, hypocritical arena best known as Hollywood. I loved the insight glimpses of what making movies was like, the bad and the good, and giggled when her mother watched her in a nude scene. You don't often hear honesty about what acting in the movie/television industry is like, just snippets and excerpts from unusually honest actors, and this book is refreshingly honest about it.<br />I felt that this could have been a great autobiography, if Cybill had focused more on her acting career and less on her bedroom.

This is one of those books that so easily could have turned into cheeze, or a mediocre modern-fantasy tale devoid of magic. Instead, virtually every word and event is permeated with subtlely fantastical elements.<br />The tale starts when nineteen-year-old Polly, looking at a \\"fire and hemlock\\" picture, suddenly remembers her old friend Thomas Lynn -- the problem is, how could she have forgotten him? And why doesn't anybody else remember him? Shifting back in time, we are shown how the preadolescent Polly wandered into a funeral, and met the quiet, mild-mannered Lynn there.<br />He remains a presence, through letters and occasional meetings, all throughout her teenage years. The two play a fantasy game through their letters -- but then Polly starts seeing it reflected in reality. To make things worse, Lynn's strangely sinister ex-wife seems to have a strange power over him. But what it is? Who is she? And how can Polly free Lynn before it's too late?<br />This is, in places, not an easy book to read; not everyone in it has a happy ending, and Polly's life is in some ways not a happy one. We see her seesawing between her paranoid mother, who believes that everyone is trying to keep secrets from her (almost to the point of mental illness); her father, who seems absorbed in his stepfamily; and her kindly grandmother who is one of the few stable points in her life. Jones never downplays the real pains of adolescence; there is no cheap \\"teen angst\\" here. Rather, we have Polly growing and maturing, recognizing the harsher parts of reality. One of the most striking parts of the book is when we are shown how shallow and pathetic one of Polly's former friends is, someone who previously seemed bright and vivacious. Her embarrassment when coming to her father's, her shock when her mother ships her out, and her intermittent feelings of loneliness and playfulness are all well-drawn and excellently written.<br />With a minimum of effort, Jones provides good \\"atmosphere\\" for the supporting characters as well, especially Lynn. He's actually present in relatively little of the novel, but his presence permeates it. The grandmother is nice, as are the friends -- both past and present -- of Polly's; they range from being shallow and petty to quieter, but more loyal.<br />This book is not as humorous as some of her other novels, though there is a sly jab at Tolkien imitators in one of the letters from Lynn. There is also some slightly more mature material, in a VERY mild joke by a slutty classmate, and the reference to a friend of Polly's briefly running off with a businessman. That, and the no-happily-ever-after vision of divorce.<br />Why four stars? Well, because I simply could not understand how things happened at the climax. I reread those last chapters six times, and was no closer at the end to understanding what the heck happened there. It is, however, outstandingly written. The descriptions are lush and full of magic.<br />Fans of multilayered fantasy, \\"Tam Lin\\", and a solid coming-of-age story will want to check this out.ell-drawn and excellently written.<br />With a minimum of effort, Jones provides good \\"atmosphere\\" for the supporting characters as well, especially Lynn.

Following up on the first book (which you should read to fully understand the plot of this one), this is an excellent second entry.<br />Three American kids -- twins Peter and Jennifer, and younger sibling Molly -- are still in Scotland, while Da and their parents are away. During a \\"dreech\\" day, Gran takes the girls to a nearby nursing home, where three old ladies -- a coven of sweet old witches -- play a card game and dote on Molly. One of them gives her a little stone with an engraving. It turns out to be a talisman -- one that soon calls a Pictish girl to the present day.<br />The little Pictish girl, Ninia, is not the only visitor. Just after her arrival, a mighty Pict warrior appears, and a sinister dark mist begins following them. Gran can hold it off for a short while. But why is Ninia in the present, how can she go home -- and what evil presence wants to destroy her?<br />This is a really charming little book, full of twists and turns and the occasional odd comment (\\"American has electricity. Scotland has power\\"). There's also a little educational value in this, which parents might like; Yolen is too talented to let this info on the Picts and their civilization be boring, and it is very vital to the plotline. The pace is snappy and full of Scottish words (there's a guide to them at the back of the book, if you want to know what \\"dreech\\" means), and descriptions that cause images to pop into the mind.<br />There's a little more comedy in this book than in the last: we have the smart-alecky talking dog, who trades barbs with anyone who will respond. Also, there is Peter's turn as an early teenage driver, which will elicit winces from any parents who read it. The menace is, possibly, even better than the wizard Michael Scot -- you probably won't even be able to guess who it is.<br />Delightful little story, really charming. A must-read for any lovers of magic or Scotland.c or Scotland.	2002-05-08

Doubtlessly the movie will be equally good, if not better.<br />\\"Attack\\" takes place ten years after \\"Phantom Menace.\\" The cocky little boy Anakin Skywalker is now a young man (still cocky), and apprenticed to Obi-Wan Kenobi. When an assassination attempt is made on Senator Padme Amidala, the Jedi Knights are called in to protect her and find out who was responsible. The knights assigned are Obi-Wan and Anakin, who have not seen Amidala for ten years. Anakin, against his Jedi training, falls in love with the beautiful young woman.<br />All of this takes place as a group of separatists, led by a former Jedi, are gathering more planets to themselves, and the Republic is threatened by a civil war that even the Jedi can't deal with. As Anakin struggles with grief, love, and personal division, he will take the first steps toward his destiny.<br />I definitely recommend this novelization over the adult one. Wrede is a better writer, with a spare but evocative style that never gets overcomplicated. Action scenes and emotional scenes are done with equal detail and a manner that never grows confusing. If the climactic battle in the movie is as good as it is in this book, it'll be great.<br />Wrede outdoes herself with atmosphere: the scenes with Anakin and Amidala fairly crackle with romantic tension, while there is a sad poignancy to many of the scenes with Obi-Wan and Anakin are in. (Perhaps the only letdowns are death scenes, which seem rather rushed) Anakin himself is one of the characters that Wrede writes best; she lets us see a great deal of his emotion, his anger, his pain, his grief, his love, and his desperation not to let down his master while being unable to fully stick to what is necessary in a Jedi. We are also shown Obi-Wan's uncertainty, Yoda's sense of humor, and the consequences when a powerful, rebellious Jedi leaves the order.<br />There is some excellent writing here from the screenplay, ranging from humor (the scene where Anakin \\"daredevils\\" over Coruscant) to poignant (Anakin's avowal that Obi-Wan is like a father to him) to parallels from the second trilogy (the bar fight, and a certain injury sustained near the end).

This time, it's ghosts.<br />American twins Peter and Jennifer have hit a rough spot, and are bickering both with each other and with the talking dog. After the dog piques their interest in the \\"White Lady\\" ghost, they come to the graveyard at midnight, and see the White Lady (also known as Mary MacFadden) meet the ghost of a bagpiper, Iain McGregor.<br />But they aren't the only ghosts -- in a centuries-old confrontation, the spirit of the lady's twin brother, Andrew, appears in Peter's body, having helped separate the ancient lovers due to class and religious differences. And once in Peter's body, he doesn't intend to LEAVE. Jennifer and Gran must find some way of getting rid of Andrew, while reuniting Mary and Iiain...<br />Yolen retains the same charm and sense of pervasive magic in this third story. Writing is delightful, especially the climax. The descriptions of the possessed Peter/Andrew's behavior is absolutely chilling. The dialogue is thoroughly convincing (yes, even the animals like Thunder and the dog), with the distinct Scottish burrs that add the final note of authenticity. (As with the previous two books, there's a word guide at the end of the book, if you can't understand some term or accented word) There isn't much comedy, but the insult wars between the dog and Peter are hilarious. Don't be worried, kids who dislike romance, there is almost no mushiness in this book.<br />Gran, a delightful old Scottish white witch, is still a great counterpoint to the inexperienced twins. Molly and the parents aren't very present in this one. Jennifer and Peter show a little more difference with each other, as Jennifer realizes just how much she cares about her brother when she risks losing him. The dog is also a good character, intermittently caring and obnoxious, but always enjoyable to read.<br />A wonderful third instalment, may Yolen write many, many more.wonderful third instalment, may Yolen write many, many more.	2002-05-04

Currently numbering three, I hope these books don't stop anytime soon.<br />The Dyers arrive in Scotland -- the parents, thirteen-year-old twins Peter and Jennifer, and their little sister Molly. They're staying with Gran and Da, an elderly couple who were once surrogate parents to their mother; Gran and Da seem a little weird but very nice. The same can be said of the house: A card game finishes itself without Peter, and Molly finds a magical piece of paper in the \\"actic\\" and scribbles on it.<br />Upon seeing the paper, Gran is aghast, claiming that it's the map of the seemingly long-dead wizard Michael Scot. The others are, unsurprisingly, skeptical since the map is written in modern English and shows modern landmarks. But the next day, nearby wheat fields have been hit with crop circles -- crop circles that look exactly like Molly's scribbles. And on a sightseeing trip, a mysterious black-haired man simply vanishes into thin air -- with Molly. Scot is back, and he wants the map.<br />Don't be fooled by the short length of this book. It's packed with excellent characterization, fast writing, and a charming, chilling plot. Yolen demonstrates her excellent skills at writing yet again, and she's in top form here.<br />The characters, except for the parents (who aren't really around enough to make much of an impression): Gran and Da are great, especially Gran. Molly is a thoroughly believable tot, with all the irritation and cuteness that that implies; Peter and Jennifer are great counterparts to one another, similar but not alike. (That would be boring, and it isn't boring)<br />Yolen's writing is nicely descriptive, and the aura of anything-could-happen is heavy on this book. Such events as the dragon, unicorn and dog are introduced in an especially evocative way, as is the showdown with Scot. From the moment the kids meet Gran and Da, you get the distinct impression that this wee corner of Scotland is magical.<br />For fans of Susan Cooper's \\"Boggart\\" books, and mythology-laden tales like \\"Wild Hunt,\\" this would be a great read.

Well, astonishingly, I really did enjoy this tale. It's head-and-shoulders over the rest of the series, in pacing, content, characterization, and description. Why couldn't the other books have been like this?<br />The book handles two enemies from warring civilizations: the Vanadurin and the Chakka (Dwarves). These two are Thork, the brother of the DelfLord and Elyn, the Princess of Jord. Flashback sequences handle why they are enemies: Elyn's twin brother Elgo destroyed the dragon Sleeth, and took the massive hoard of Dwarf gold for his kingdom. When the Dwarves demanded that it be returned, Elgo responded scornfully. There was a bloody battle, during which Thork's father and Elyn's brother were both killed.<br />In the present, an evil wizard named Andrak conspires with the powerful dragon Kalgalath to get the gold away from the Vanadurin, with the demand that Kalgalath find him a tiny silver horn among the treasure. Kalgalath can't be defeated -- or can he? Elyn and Thork, initially distrusting and disliking each other, must depend on each other in the effort to find a silveron warhammer that could destroy Kalgalath...<br />I wish that each of Dennis McKiernan's books took six years to write; maybe then they would be as pleasant to read as this one. I enjoyed such scenes as Elgo's hunting for Sleeth, the scenes with Dalavar (who seems a little spacey compared to his other appearances), Elyn's training as a Warrior Maid, and the appearance of the Utruni (who are talking more normally than in the Hel's Crucible duology). There are also visible links to future adventures (chronologically) especially the Silver Call duology.<br />Modru annoyed me in the other books where he appeared, but he was unusually smart, devious, and cunning. Elyn and Thork have more care taken with their characterizations and their gradual movement from disgust to respect to love. Elyn's training against the odds set against her (including her whiny spinster aunt) made me respect the character, and the fact that she didn't turn into a blubbering idiot when she fell in love. Thork is tough, gruff, stubborn, with a hidden soft streak.<br />The writing style and dialogue are still \\"ye olde\\" but more polished and professional. It didn't annoy me much at all. I just wish Modru and Andrak would quit hissing or sissing (yes, they keep doing it). I get it, they're bad. They don't need to hiss to emphasize it.<br />Why three stars? Well, one thing is the Tolkienian elements. These are nowhere near as numerous as they are in his other books, aside from the Vanadurin, but: A dragon attacks and conquers a Dwarf citadel inside a mountain. He slaughters the inhabitants and takes their treasure for himself. He then takes a prolonged nap on top of the giant pile of treasure. Oh WHERE have I read this before?<br />Normally that would result in only four stars. But the book is so awkwardly arranged that I found parts of it near-impossible to read. I don't mind flashbacks, but literally half of this book is made up of them. And it isn't simply flashing back to one time, but up to three alongside the present storyline. We skip back in time eleven years, then one year, then to the present, then seven years -- it gets very confusing and hard to read. I had to keep flipping back in the book to figure out what had happened in that part of the story.<br />Overall, the best of McKiernan's books that I have currently read.

Specifically, the \\"whys\\" of the old fairy tale \\"Rumplestiltskin,\\" and why he wanted to steal away the infant prince. In a book market where just about every retelling or fairy tale sequel idea has been exhausted, Gary Schmidt crafts an intriguing tale which gives us the answers to our \\"whys.\\"<br />Tousle and his small, odd-looking father (called only \\"Da\\") are travelling to the city of Wolverham, where a rebellion against one of the king's lords has just been stopped. Tousle notices the queen, a sweet but very sad woman who lost her infant son years ago; also a blind young boy his own age, who was arrested as one of the rebels. When the king asks the crowd if there is anyone who will ask for mercy for the rebels, both the queen and Tousle speak up.<br />The result is that the queen is sent back to the abbey where she lives, and Tousle is given seven days to unravel a riddle: What fills a hand fuller than a skein of gold? Tousle, unsurprisingly, has no idea. So he sets off with the blind rebel boy, Innes, to ask first Da and then the queen the answer to the riddle. But they are pursued both by the sinister King's Grip, the stirrings of a very different rebellion, and the question of what happened to the baby prince all those years ago. Where is he? Who is he? And could the queen recognize him now?<br />Schmidt does an exceptional job bringing a new spin and new explanation to the \\"whys\\" of Rumplestiltskin. It's pretty clear from the beginning who \\"Da\\" is, but not his motives; those don't become clear until the end. Instead the focus is on characters that are not always what they seem, such as Da and the King. Even the bad guys have layers.<br />His writing is very good, expressing the grittiness of medieval life without making it icky. Some passages are almost poetry; others are horrifying in their concept. My only beef (pun intended) is that he spends a great deal of time focusing on the food that people are eating. I don't mind this in moderation, but he was making me very hungry.<br />Tousle and Innes are a great couple of heroes. Tousle is a very honest, humble, good-natured young man who ends up in over his head. Innes is more of a mystery boy, in that you often don't know things about his past is or what he's thinking. We also have good supporting characters like the prince's nurse and her husband, and the kind, sad queen who is banished away from the castle because of the disappearance of her son.<br />This is a great story for those of you who enjoy Donna Jo Napoli, Robin McKinley and Gail Carson Levine (or Vivian Vande Velde's satirical \\"Rumplestiltskin Problem\\" book). Excellent sequel, and one for any fan of fairy tales or retellings.sing on the food that people are eating.

But Phelim's life takes an unexpected turn when a bunch of scraggly prehistoric dwarves and something called the Domovoy invade his house, pursued by the sinister Black Dog. They force Phelim out, saying that he is Jack O'Green and has to deal with the Stoor Worm.<br />Before long, Phelim encounters mad Sweeney, a veteran of the Napoleonic wars who lives in perpetual terror in the trees; the Obby Oss, a delightfully goofy specter; and Alexia, a shadowless apprentice witch who fled her courses in the Dark Arts. So Phelim, the Maiden, the Fool and the Horse all set out (Phelim only half-willingly) to destroy the Stoor Worm, who was wakened by the guns of the first world war. And the heat from the wakening Worm is causing strange things to hatch from stones, and roam throughout the British Isles. And Phelim will encounter soul-stealing merrows, the hideous Noonday Twister and the bloodthirsty cornwives, skinless nuckelavees, maddened human beings, and finally the monstrous Stoor Worm itself...<br />McCaughrean does an excellent job with his book; with the slightly clueless hero, magical and sharp-witted heroine, and a pair of odd but poignant sidekicks, it reminds me of Lloyd Alexander's books. She also, unlike most authors, harbors no romantic illusions about \\"Old Ways\\" and how mean they could be. She is unafraid to weave the spectacular and the everyday, with a few subtle comments on the human condition.<br />Her writing is extremely evocative, very descriptive as children's books go; she devotes more descriptions to the oddities like the Oss than to ordinary things like the reapers. The dialogue is also very believable. McCaughrean also adds new spins to old ideas, such as the faeries; these are not innocent little sprites, or Elf-like Sidhe. Readers won't forget these faeries in a hurry.<br />A darker, bittersweet feel permeates the later chapters, where Phelim loses his innocent mindset, glimpses what he is capable of, and does something that readers may initially condemn. However, I applaud Ms. McCaughrean for having him do that, simply because his remorseful response after the fact is admirable and very true. But while everyone makes mistakes, and his feelings are certainly understandable, she also makes no excuses for what he did or felt; there are consequences to no longer being \\"ever-good.\\" This is extremely rare in books of any kind, and to see it in a kids' book is excellent.<br />By an author with less talent, Phelim might have been a real pain to read about; he spends over half the book denying that he is Jack O'Green, and often responding wrongly or needing to be helped out. But his confusion and fear (especially after seeing his shirt being washed by... well, you'll see) over the things that he has seen and what he is expected to do is well written and understandable. Alexia initially seems like a fairly ordinary character, but her traumatic past adds an extra dimension and strength to her. Same with Sweeney, who initially seems like he will be an entertaining character, but his fear and guilt make him almost a tragic figure. The Oss is simply fun in an overall serious adventure. You just can't get him down, and he remains a source of emotional support and entertainment.<br />A tight, fast-paced and immensely imaginative fantasy story, this is a great read for kids and adults alike.old ideas, such as the faeries; these are not innocent little sprites, or Elf-like Sidhe.

1559025:US	50881246	R20I62HHS0CLW7	0618129030	669379389	The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, Part 1)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	The beginning of the beginning	A new wave of readers are devouring the Tolkien books, thanks to the arrival of the first of the movie blockbusters (as you can tell by the pic of Elijah Wood on the cover). And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a darn good read.<br />We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, and quite eccentric. He has also adopted his bright young nephew/cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life after that. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.<br />Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the aghast young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the dark lord Sauron. It corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him...<br />Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the \\"feel\\" of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.<br />Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. (The reader almost wants to yell \\"Don't do it!\\" when Frodo is given the Ring) The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.<br />One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't overdo the descriptions of such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.<br />I will warn you that you should have the second and third books on hand when you read this. As this was originally intended to be one huge chunk of a book, it ends on a semi-cliffhanger. (The movie ends in about the same place, so if it frustrated you there, you'd be frustrated here as well) If you're a person who can't handle anything more complex than a half-hour sitcom, or think that Harry Potter is the pinnacle of modern literature, then this book is not for you.<br />Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say \\"everyhobbit.\\"<br />We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit with a fascination for Elves to a bolder, more decisive person. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.<br />Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today.ted when the pressure is put on him.

The pre-Tolkien fantasy authors are too often neglected because of their different style, but any person who appreciates beautiful language will appreciate Dunsany's unique fantasies.<br />This includes such stories as \\"Charon,\\" a brief story about the ferryman of the dead; the rather odd \\"Three Infernal Jokes\\"; \\"The Guest,\\" about a young man who launches into a strange monologue; \\"Thirteen at Table,\\" about a strange house and a fox-hunt; \\"Three Sailors' Gambit\\" is somewhat more prosaic, the tale of three sailors in a pub; \\"The Exiles' Club\\" is the story of a sumptuous but somehow strange and sinister house in London; \\"Where the Tides Ebb and Flow\\" is a dream -- and a darn disturbing one at that, where a young man dreams that \\"I had done a horrible thing, so that burial was to be denied me either in soil or sea, neither could there be any hell for me\\"; \\"The Field\\" is at first mysterious and then saddening, where someone visits a beautiful field where he senses something terrible; \\"A Tale of London,\\" where a sultan asks his hashish-eater to tell him about the far-off city of London; \\"Narrow Escape\\" tells what occurs when an evil magician decides to obliterate London; \\"Bethmoora\\" is the reminiscences of an exotic city that no longer exists; \\"Hashish Man\\" is something of a sequel to \\"Bethmoora,\\" in which a man tells the narrator about how he uses hashish to travel to the city of Bethmoora. \\"How An Enemy Came to Thlunrana\\" is how a mighty wizards' citadel was overcome by an unexpected means; \\"In Zaccarath\\" is the story of a mighty, beautiful, and seemingly everlasting city and its king; \\"Idle City\\" is a very odd one, about a polytheistic/monotheistic city, now very lonely-looking; \\"The Madness of Andelsprutz\\" is another story about a \\"dead\\" city, in which the narrator is told how a certain city became \\"soulless\\".<br />\\"Secret of the Sea\\" is about a very sad sailor; \\"Idle Days on the Yann\\" is exactly what it sounds like, a pleasantly plotless but beautifully written story about sailing on the mythical Yann River; \\"A Tale of the Equator\\" is about the foreseeing of a magnificent city; \\"Spring in Town\\" is about the arrival of a season; \\"In the Twilight\\" is the beautifully-written vision of a man whose boat had capsized; \\"Wind and Fog\\" is a slightly odd little story about the North Wind and some fog; \\"A Story of Land and Sea\\" is the sequel to a story in Book of Wonder, more about Captain Shard; \\"After the Fire\\" is what happens when a dark star collides with the world, and what other creatures see in man's temples; \\"Assignation,\\" the last story in the collection, is about what a poet and Fame have to say to one another.<br />As for this edition: I must agree with the previous reviewer who commented on the lame cover and unfortunate title, as well as the fact that the binding could be better. That's why it rates four out of a potential five stars. I will also warn buyers that several of these stories appear in other anthologies, so don't be surprised if you bump into things you already have.

This series of short stories is connected with &quot;Gods of Pegana,&quot; which is currently in print with it in the massive Fantasy Masterworks book, available only in the UK.<br />In it, you will find tales of Slid, an upstart young god; the Dawnchild, who loses her golden ball; the hideous Pestilence; Time and how it overthrew even what the gods favored; laughter, prophecies, doom and hope, punishment, night and day, gods and human beings.<br />As usual, he wrote enchantingly. His prose is somewhat biblical in manner, which may scare off people who prefer lighter reads. This isn't something you can really skim, as you can't skim the Mabinogion, the Iliad, or the Eddas. Dunsany had an exquisite manner of writing, and he never skimps on lush details and beautiful descriptions.<br />A wonderful piece of work. I hope that someone reprints it very soon.	2002-04-30

The second book of the Hel's Crucible duology almost rivals the first for boredom and irritating tendencies. During the course of the book, Beau comments, \\"Four years? No wonder I'm sick of war\\" or words to that effect. I felt like chiming in, \\"You and me both.\\"<br />This book picks up where the first left off, where Tip, Beau, Loric, Phais and Bekki are all setting out to finally get that stupid little coin to Agron. When they finally get it to him, they find out that there is a specific (and very dumb) purpose behind it, and become even more enmeshed in the war with Modru's sinister forces. At the same time, Tip finds that his girlfriend Rynna and her band of Warrows (warrior-hobbits) are still alive. But Modru's horde is not the only thing that threatens Our Heroes -- a deadly plague is sweeping Dendor. And to destroy Modru's forces, they will have to rely on a force that no one can control...<br /><br />The first book was kind of like watching the heroes running on a hamster wheel; they were running, but they weren't actually going anywhere or accomplishing anything. This time, they actually accomplish things. But it's the same thing; they run to someplace, they get new allies for the Good Guys, something bad happens, they overcome it. Repeat for 550 pages. We are told in almost day by day detail about what they were doing, where they were going, and what direction they were going in. Loric, Phais and Bekki all sort of drift in and out.<br /><br />And major plot developments like the plague, the destruction of Atala, and that thing with Galarun and the sword feel tacked on. The plague, for example, begins and ends within the course of this book, and it adds nothing to the plot. We're told that the Silver Sword can kill Gyphon, about halfway through the book; that's over three quarters through the story, and it feels like it was tacked in solely to add more pages to the meager storyline. The last thirty pages are exceptionally poorly written; it feels like McKiernan got sick of the whole story, and simply added some vague descriptions to an initial outline. The extremely important threat from Gyphon is added as an afterthought.<br /><br />The cast is too large for anyone to have much character development, and there is very little personal difference between Elves, Mages, Men, Warrows, and so on. Traumatic events such as the destruction of Atala last a lot less time then they should. After Loric and Phais find out exactly what happened, everyone gets upset for about ten minutes, then ambles off on their way. And supposedly important events are... well, underwhelming is too vague a word to use. When they finally get the idiotic coin to Agron (and by this time I was thoroughly sick of it) we are told its purpose. I ended up shouting, \\"That's IT? That's ALL?\\" At one point, Agron's army is wiped out by an avalanche. There is no real feel of crisis during all of this.<br /><br />Even so, the climax managed to snag me and force me to take it seriously. But then the Utruni showed up, and everything came apart. I'm sorry, but when they started speaking in a mangled Yorkshire accent, I laughed so hard I dropped the book. The Warrows are utterly annoying warrior hobbits (imagine Frodo joining the Marines), without the simple charm of Tolkien's creations. The Elves are still weird; the Dwarves sort of peter out somewhere during the story.<br /><br />Characterizations are even flatter than in the first book, and unfortunately we also have more annoying female Warrows; Rynna, and her irritating cousin Linnet. We still have Tolkien ripoffs: the Warrows are essentially hobbits in combat; the Gargons/Balrogs; Agron/Elendil; trolls, uruk-hai, orcs/ogrus, hloks, and rukhs; Boskydells/Shire; Modru/Sauron; Atala/Numenor; Gyphon/Morgoth; ents/Woodwer, and so on...<br /><br />Dialogue is still a problem, as is repetition. If I hear \\"oh my\\" or \\"barn rats!\\" one more time, I think I'll shriek. We are forced to endure the exact same descriptions in the season-changing ritual as before; and a paragraph on one of the final pages is, word for word, identical to one in the Iron Tower trilogy. (Mr. McKiernan, if you can't write a new description of the Thornwall, please don't write any description of it at ALL!)<br /><br />As in the last book, we are treated to excruciating romance. Thankfully, Elf lovers Phais and Loric are pretty much celibate in this book. But we have Tip and Rynna, and Beau taking up with the picky Linnet. (Yes, again, he falls instantly in love with minimal exposure to Warrow girls, and I fail to see the attraction to either Rynna or Linnet) Unfortunately, we also have to deal with Elissan, the pervert Elf from Book 1 -- she's still focusing on seeing Tip in the nude. (I was once jokingly called a \\"pervy hobbit fancier,\\" but the description fits her better!)<br /><br />Outstandingly poor, failing even to succeed as a ripoff.

I can't say yea or nay about how Lady Charlotte Guest did with the source materials of the book, but I have to say that it's pretty entertaining.<br />It chronicles various tales from Wales, going back to ancient legends about heroes and gods, and then forward in time to recognizable elements such as King Arthur. Since this is a Dover thrift book (one of the pricier ones, since it's longer) the quality is so-so; the cover artwork is better than most of the thrift books, and the paper is only a little better than newpaper-quality.<br />In terms of readability, however, Guest's Mabinogion does not win any prizes. The translated sentences really could use a little tweaking, and often dialogue between several people is crammed together into one long paragraph. This is not only distracting, but hard to read.<br />Overall, it is fairly nice but needs an editor to tweak it in places. Fans of fantasy as well as mythology may want to check this out, especially if they are fans of the Prydain or Lost Years of Merlin series.

It's definitely worth reprinting, and hopefully it will be sometime.<br />Terra Viridian is a young woman on a colony, who sees a vision and destroys fifteen hundred people with a laser rifle. Deemed insane and dangerous, she lapses into a waking coma and is sentenced to live in an orbital prison called the Underworld. There, she spends seven years stuck in her strange, inhuman vision of light.<br />Seven years later, she is subjected to the experimental dream machine, and for the first time other people see her seemingly insane visions. A man named Aaron Fisher searches for the long-lost sister of Terra Viridian, after his pregnant wife was killed by Terra. Elsewhere, a band of cubers come to the Constellation Club; one of them is the enigmatic Magician, and the other is the Queen of Hearts, a beautiful woman with heart pins in her red hair and a golden mask hiding her face -- and her tragic past. But there is a connection between the Queen of Hearts and Terra Viridian. And when the vision touches the Magician as well, he and his friends set out to find what it is that made Terra kill those people, and what dreams of light.<br />As with her fantasy books, Patricia McKillip falls into no plot cliches. Though this space opera contains some elements that all SF books have to some degree, there's a fantastical bent to it all, and a lack of the usual parts such as aliens, ultra-powerful ships, and so on. This is a story where you can't predict what is out there, and can't guess what and why.<br />The characters start out as enigmas and gradually unfold in front of the reader. We have Aaron Fisher, the man tormented by his lost love; the beautiful Queen of Hearts, who is determined to keep her past a secret until it becomes vitally important; Terra Viridian, a hollow-eyed prisoner locked in her dream for years, until she has to wake up; and the Magician, perhaps my favorite character, who is in some ways the most mysterious and entertaining person in the whole book.<br />The writing is starker than her fantasy books, except in the last fourth of it; there we have the dreamy beauty of language that McKillip is famous for. She balances it nicely, as such language would be totally out of place in a grubby bar than out in the stars over an alien planet. We are also treated to more of McKillip's musings on revenge, loss, and forgiveness. There is some innuendo unsuitable for kids, but this is fine for teens and adults.<br />One of the most original SF books I've read...erhaps my favorite character, who is in some ways the most mysterious and entertaining person in the whole book.<br />The writing is starker than her fantasy books, except in the last fourth of it; there we have the dreamy beauty of language that McKillip is famous for.

The cousin also has a housekeeper, and Lewis soon befriends Bertie, the housekeeper's blind son. Bertie and Lewis soon begin exploring happily in a hedge maze, until they find a strange monument in the center. When they pry a brick loose, some invisible, laughing creature escapes and chases them back to the house.<br />Soon afterward, the adults at Barnavelt Manor start behaving strangely. The cousin becomes sly and cackling, the housekeeper is like a sinister wind-up doll, and the gardener is snarling. Lewis suspects that somehow, this is all connected to a psychotic Puritan witch-finder, Malachiah Pruitt, who once made life miserable for Lewis's ancestor... until the ancestor struck back somehow. And now Pruitt is somehow back for revenge against the Barnavelts.<br />It's always sort of a guilty pleasure to read one of these books, where horror is handled in a way both lavish and sparing. Something as minor as the rustle of twigs or a funny-looking gravestone can be significant and can strike horror in the reader. Writing-wise, this is one of the better ones. Strickland, who completed the book, knows well how to flesh out Bellairs' storyline. The atmosphere is chilling and almost claustrophobic, in that the walls keep closing in on our heroes. The main problem, perhaps, is that there is relatively little humor leavening the story, except for the continuing Watson-Holmes joke between Bertie and Lewis. On the flip side, late in the book is one of the most touching scenes I have ever read in a Bellairs and/or Strickland book, between Lewis and Jonathan.<br />Characterizations are very nice. Lewis gains a little more self-confidence and loses a little weight; Jonathan is a little less zesty than usual, but he is also absent for large sections of the book. Bertie is a nice sidekick for Lewis, and his means of knowing that there is something wrong despite his blindness is well done. (The best meaning of stiff-upper-lip) The housekeeper and cousin are a little two-dimensional, but then dimension is not needed. Malachiah Pruitt is a wonderfully sinister villain -- great idea, to make one of the Puritan witch-hunters a psychotic wanna-rule-the-world type.

Initially, one would think that a truly talented author's quirky, unique style could not be very nearly duplicated. But Brad Strickland is doing a fine job with the characters that Bellairs created, and this is one of his best efforts.<br />Lewis Barnavelt and Rose Rita Pottinger have to participate in a talent show whether they like it or not. When they hit on the idea of doing a magic show (fake, not real), they end up consulting a friend at a museum who allows them to borrow some books on stage magic. But when Rose Rita picks up an old parchment scroll, she inadvertantly lets a drop of blood fall on some magic dust -- and the dust turns into a living spider. The two of them flee, but Rose Rita brings the scroll, with intent to return it.<br />Except she then starts acting oddly. When the talent show results in a dismal failure, Rose Rita is left with a burning hatred and a wish for revenge. Then she starts dreaming of becoming a giant spider, and hearing the voice of the scroll's previous owner -- Belle Frisson, a sorceress who now wants to use Rose Rita to rise again and live forever.<br />This is labelled as a \\"Lewis Barnavelt\\" book, but at least half of it focuses on Rose Rita. While fans of Bellairs will be well acquainted with Lewis's insecurities, Strickland takes the opportunity to delve into a few of Rose Rita's. He also manages to give us a message about revenge and hatred and grudges without beating the reader over the head with it. The Message is simply there.<br />How much of a \\"Bellairs\\" book is this? Very much so, and not just in terms of having creepy beasties and a megalomaniac villain. The pacing and tone are very correct, as is the usage of maybe-it's-real-maybe-not ancient magics. I could have used a little more bickering between Mrs. Zimmerman and Uncle Jonathan, but the comforting scene between Rose Rita and Mrs. Zimmerman makes up for that.<br />Strickland does an excellent job with the evil sorceress Belle Frisson, and uses the ever-growing, evil-spirit spider very well also. The idea of a drop of blood turning powder into a malevolent spider is not just good spinechilling material, but it also is quite Bellairsesque.<br />This is an amazing spinechiller. I do warn you though: Arachnaphobics should definitely not read this book, or they'll never sleep again., evil-spirit spider very well also.

However, these are quickly swamped under by an unusual, well-written story and great character growth.<br />When a golden chalice (first found by the Drews in \\"Under Sea Over Stone\\") is stolen from its museum, the mysterious Old One Merriman enlists their help and the help of the youngest Old One, Will Stanton. At first, the kids don't really get along; things seem fairly uneventful, except for Jane participating in an ancient ritual in which the women of the village get together and weave a vaguely humanoid figure, the Greenwitch. The Greenwitch is then thrown into the sea, after people touch it and make a wish. Jane, followed by strange impressions of the Greenwitch, makes a very unusual wish indeed.<br />But then her brothers and Will bump into someone else -- a strange painter who steals a picture of Barney's, and then lures the Drew boys into his home. He's a member of the Dark, and he forces Barney to scry out a message about the Grail for him. Then a strange, wild chaos strikes the town, with a ghost ship and the angry Greenwitch herself...<br />While this book is not the best of the series (the second takes that honor), it nevertheless is an excellent piece of work, as fantasy and as a study of the characters. The first chapter was a little weak; it felt too much like a part of \\"Over Sea Under Stone.\\" However, this ceases as soon as Will comes on to the scene. The book then takes on a tone that seems, somehow, to balance out between \\"Dark is Rising\\" and \\"Over Sea Under Stone.\\"<br />The Drews are better fleshed out and individualized in this book. Jane proves that Cooper is one of the few fantasy writers who can create genuinely strong female characters; this is, in a sense, her book. Barney's abilities aside from his siblings are explored, giving them all a sense of being separate people. Will is clearly more comfortable with his role as an Old One, as he is more knowledgeable and smoother at handling situations with the Dark. At the same time, he's also able to shift into being a preteen boy, tapping Morse code to the Drew kids through the wall. (I think that I would have a crush on Will if he weren't about nine years too young)<br />The writing in this book is versatile, becoming dreamy, stark, magical, frightening, or ordinary as the scene requires. The underwater scene with Tethys was one of the best written fantasy scenes I've ever read, while we are also given a horrific nightmare (Jane's) and the chilling pirate ship attacking a modern-day town when reality goes out of whack. Though the Greenwitch ceremony is women-only, Cooper doesn't bash the reader with any ideas; the Greenwitch herself is intriguingly written, childlike and possessive and kind of needy.<br />This is a nice part of an amazing series, and definitely worth the read.able with his role as an Old One, as he is more knowledgeable and smoother at handling situations with the Dark.

Jean and her friend Michael knock the acid-tongued, chameleon-clothed librarion over, and Jacqueline ends up coming along to a little meeting of the Seven Sinners. This group includes Jean, witty artist Michael, brainy priest Jose, slightly odd siblings Anne and Andy, serious-minded Ted, and plain seductress Dana. The only fly in their collective ointment is Albert, the son of Andy's father's friend -- Albert is physically and emotionally repulsive, and when he crashes a party with accusations that someone stole his research, no one really pays attention.<br />Until Jean finds him in the Temple of Mithra, with his throat cut. Albert manages to trace a number seven before he dies, and soon mysterious \\"accidents\\" begin to follow Jean. She and Jacqueline must unravel the mystery -- who would want an insignificant slob like Albert dead?<br />I will warn you in advance, this book is quite different in tone from \\"Murders of Richard III\\" (which I didn't like very much) and from \\"Die for Love\\" and \\"Naked Once More.\\" Though it's not as serious as the second, or as funny as the third and fourth, it nevertheless possesses a dry wit and lopsided view of humanity in general.<br />Peters manages to keep the various characters' personalities separate and distinct. She also shows skill at making them act like real people. All of the characters have good points and bad points; some are kind, some are not. There's even an entertaining scene where they compare their own weaknesses to the seven deadly sins.<br />The writing style is unspectacular compared to her other books, but nicely evocative. This book doesn't really contain any potentially objectionable content, beyond a few mild comments about legs, and a scene where Dana's bikini top is stolen. Be forewarned, though this is a Jacqueline Kirby mystery, most of the book is from Jean's perspective rather than Jacqueline's. Jacqueline is still an enchantingly acerbic, brainy, and amusing presence, lighting up all the scenes.<br />Overall, a nice little romp through Rome.

A generic quest with stock characters, it fails to be epic and instead meanders over a plot that is easy to forget.<br />Two travellers arrive in a small town, seeking a man with one eye: Arin Flameseer, an Elf who sees the future in fire; and Aiko, a disgraced female warrior from Ryodo. They find two men with only one eye, a town drunk and a very battered warrior. They take both men with them (and a rotting troll eyeball -- GROSS!) on their quest. The quest, told in flashback form, is that Arin had a vision of armies, blood, death, and dragons, all centering around a green stone called the Dragonstone. To find the answer, she must uncover the \\"cat who fell from grace, the mad monarch's rutting peacock, one-eye in dark water, ferret in high king's cage, and cursed keeper of the faith in the maze.\\" The problem is, none of these are riddles easily unraveled...<br /><br />Well, you won't find anything new here. We have an elf, a couple of warriors (man and woman), and a slobbering drunk battling an evil wizard. It's like a D&D game, but less fun. Attempts at humor fall utterly flat; I was bored by the quibbling between the dragons, and Aiko's bickering with Alos is annoying, not entertaining. Alos himself seems like a half-hearted attempt at creating a funny character, but most readers will like him as much as they liked Jar Jar Binks. Maybe less.<br /><br />The writing itself is obsessed with detail; we get descriptions of the physical characteristics of the characters over and over. McKiernan also has a distracting way of stopping the action dead with short two-page chapters that tell the history of an area or the background of a species. I will admit, the explanations for the various parts of the rede were clever... but as one of the prior reviewers said, a nympho-nutso queen? Oh, great idea; this was probably the weirdest and least tasteful part of the book.<br /><br />McKiernan's repetition problem rears its ugly head again, not only within the confines of the book but within the series as well. We have a very intricate description of Aiko early in the book, and a nearly identical description only a hundred pages later. We're told about the eyepatch and \\"white-filmed eye\\" about a thousand times. Alos must throw up dozens of times during the book. Vanidar keeps cuddling with his sweetie in the middle of an important discussion. And if Aiko says that her tiger senses danger ONE MORE TIME...<br /><br />Within the series, we have the same ol', same ol'. I ask you: Why does Mr. McKiernan give us detailed descriptions of what Elf males wear, since they all look alike? I've seen the same description in every other book I've read: blond hair, headband, same clothing... On the same note, McKiernan only gives his good female characters one kind of dress: \\"simple yet elegant,\\" with a straight skirt under a bodice, and with the character's hair tied up in ribbons that match the ribbons on the bodice. Oh yes -- and her feet will always be peeking under the hem. (How many people have feet that peek?) When describing the Elf seasonal ritual, we're told \\"... yet their hearts were full of joy,\\" a line from the Hel's Crucible duology during the same ritual. (Yes, we have to read about the season-changing ritual again, which is identical to the prior descriptions of it)<br /><br />The characterizations are flat -- the characters are given tragic pasts, in an effort to give them dimension. But they rarely act based on those pasts, and never step out of their stock roles. They also seem pretty clueless; Arin is supposed to be incredibly old and experienced, but she has less of a clue than Aiko or Egil. This is also not one of the Mithgar books that can be given to kids; there is some pretty steamy content, as well as disgusting injuries and references to torture and mutilation on a living person.<br /><br />Being a McKiernan book, we have a love story: hardly surprising that Arin and Egil get together, since she is a beautiful (and feminine) elf and he is a strong, silent, virile type.

Here Gardner overcomes his slight roughness from \\"Multitude,\\" and returns to top form.<br />Vushta, City of Forbidden Delights, is gone: demons have dragged it down into the Netherhells, and with it any hope of a cure for Ebenezum. Only a few wizards are left in what remains of it. Guxx Unfufadoo plans to invade the upper world. And, perhaps worst of all, two of Wuntvor's girlfriends have found out about each other!<br />What can be done? Wuntvor must lead a special expedition to the Netherhells, consisting of Hendrek, Snarks, Norei, and Cuthbert the talking sword. (Ebenezum is absent for most of this adventure) Among the problems: Commercialization has hit the Netherhells (much to Snarks' horror), Guxx plans to take over the world, Vushta is in the slimy hands of the demons, and Wuntvor has this magical hat that keeps spitting out ferrets, flowers and scarves...<br />The lunatic funniness of this one is too good to be described. The Netherhells are a hilarious spoof of the generally-accepted vision of hell and demons, coupled with a few sly jabs at commercialization and massive construction. We also have the climax of Wuntvor's very complex love life (I was afraid those girls were going to duke it out over him). We even have Cuthbert, a cowardly and fastidious talking sword who listens in from inside his scabbard and squeals in dismay when used to kill an enemy. And Wuntvor's army of ferrets is too hilarious for words, as is how he manages to mass-produce them (\\"Yes! No! No! Yes! Yes! Yes! No!\\").<br />The characters are still fun! (Hard for any author to keep up) Wuntvor is required to grow a little more in this book, since he has to LEAD an expedition, rather than bouncing around with his master. Snarks and Brax are three-dimensional in a delightfully two-dimensional manner; as is doom-speaking warrior Hendrek, and the psychotic Dealer of Death (yes, he's back, and he's squishing demons). The weak link is Norei, who doesn't have any of the quirks of the other characters. But if you bypass her, the cast is just perfect.<br />As ever, it's sparingly-written; we aren't overloaded with detail or unnecessary dialogue. Parents can utter a sigh of relief, since this trilogy is fine for kids. And any kid or teen who's read fantasy (or even fairy tales) will laugh themselves silly, just as well as the adults.<br />Wonderful conclusion (sort of) to the Ebenezum trilogy.

The sequel, &quot;Multitude of Monsters,&quot; is not quite up to the same level of excellence. It felt like Gardner (whose first book was originally a cluster of short stories) was still getting used to the whole &quot;novel&quot; way of writing.<br />This novel picks up where &quot;Malady&quot; left off, with the magic-allergic wizard Ebenezum, his hormone-addled apprentice Wuntvor, the relentlessly truthful demon Snarks, and the none-too-swift-but-has-a-big-club warrior Hendrek (&quot;Doom!&quot;). They're still heading for the City of Forbidden Delights (and Wuntvor still can't wait), but they encounter unexpected delays in the form of Brownies, Brax the Salesdemon (&quot;Along with your hellishly small fine print!&quot;), the beautiful witch Norei, and a collection of magical beasties who want equal recognition as unicorns. (There is a unicorn too, who appears a little obsessed with pointing out that Wuntvor is a virgin) Any problems? Well, the demons are invading, and Ebenezum seems to have gotten himself into a giant shoe...<br />This is quite different in its layout. While the first book was a series of interconnected vignettes, this is a single, longer story. As a result, there is a different feel to it. Gardner seems to get a little stuck on some continuing themes (like the monster organization) and they last a little longer and become a little more serious than they should.<br />That said, the characters are as delightful as ever. Poor Ebenezum still sneezes up a storm whenever he's near magic; Wuntvor falls instantly in love with any female characters nearby him. Hendrek is not as full-fleshed as the others; Snarks is still great fun, though a little less prominent. Other faves like the &quot;Damsel and the Dragon&quot; show up, as does the deliciously slimy salesdemon Brax and the fearsome Guxx Unfufadoo.<br />His humor is as fresh and witty as ever, full of lunatic situations and the crazy spells. The dialogue is just believable enough, without being too kooky. (There are some fantasy novels where you half-expect to hear a laugh track)<br />Oh, and &quot;Bog Womblers.&quot; You'll know it when you see it.

Books	4	2	3	N	N	Cute	A cute little satire on the power of the press, how easily people can be led to believe the untrue, and the exclusion or inclusion of the weird and different. It also hints, for the eagle-eyed reader, at a very famous fairy-tale and a small detail that never gets handled....<br />\\"I was a rat.\\" Or so says the lead character of this little illustrated novel. A little boy in a page uniform turns up on the doorstep of cobbler Bob and his wife Joan -- he can't give any kind of self-identification, except claiming that he was a rat. (Meanwhile, in little newspaper snippets we hear that the prince is getting married). The little boy, now named Roger, displays some ratlike tendencies like chewing through pencils and ripping up pillows. Despite this, he is also sweet-natured and eager to please.<br />But things go awry when the Royal Philosopher wants to study Roger -- and the boy escapes. He bumps into a juvenile gang, a freak-show, and is finally labelled a ratlike monster by the press and high-up officials. Who can help him now?<br />This is a cute story, pretty sparsely written and with a straightforward dang-he's-one-step-ahead-of-us plotline. There are a few plot holes, and some of the explanations feel a little odd and forced, though they do fit. And of course, there are the overblown bits of tabloid -- great fun.<br />Roger is a thoroughly sympathetic character, whom you are able to relate to despite the fact that he is so easily led, and thinks he's a rat. Equally, but differently, relatable are Joan and Bob, and Princess Aurelia. The other characters are more stereotyped in a pleasant sort of way, such as the gang of boys, the circus owner, and the various officials who crack down on Roger.<br />Overall, a cute and fun read. Definitely worth it.	2002-04-14

Terry Pratchett is one of the rare few authors who can progress a series without tiring his subject matter or his invented universe. This is outing twenty-five, and Discworld is as fun as ever -- maybe even more so. It's a world of werewolves, hard-nosed cops, incredibly cynical politicians,<br />William de Worde, a member of the elite (read: snotty) classes, wants to start a newspaper, the Ankh-Morpork Times, using printing presses with movable type and employing dwarves. Soon he has also gained a skilfull but very ladylike reporter named Sacharissa, and a photographer vampire named Otto. Their news remains fairly dull (except for \\"funny\\" vegetables) until the Patrician is accused of murder.<br />The problem is that William wants to tell the people the Truth -- which gets him some enemies, fast. The Times soon has competition from a tabloid; William and his staff are being targeted by a pair of hit men, including Mr. Tulip, who is a strong-arm psychopath with very fine sensibilities and a very dirty vocabulary (I still giggle when I read \\"---ing\\"). With the help of the Watch, and the Truth on their side, William and his friends unravel the mystery to find out who committed the murder, and who wants the presses stopped for good.<br />Terry Pratchett's satires are never heavy-handed, and he's in fine form here. He subtlely brings up questions into the reader's mind about journalism, truth, free press, and the impact of all three on justice and society.<br />The heads of old friends pop up: Death (of course), Foul Ole Ron, Gaspode, the ever-astonishing Vimes, Detritus the thick-skulled troll, the inexplicably entertaining Patrician. We also have some new favorites: Ladylike reporter Sacharissa, in the tradition of Pratchett's lead women, is competant and thoroughly realistic, filling in the gaps where William can be a little clueless. William himself is a pleasantly earnest and humble hero. The dwarves, especially Goodmountain, are great as supporting cast.<br />But the real star of this book is Otto, the abstaining vampire who has transferred his bloodlust to iconography and the study of light and shadow -- the only problem being that, as a vampire, sudden bursts of light turn him into dust. Not only does he get all the best lines, but he has memorable scenes where he will stagger around shrieking, \\"Aarggghharrggghharrgghh\\", or turning into dust (\\"Oohhhhhbbugggerrr\\"). Occasionally his vampiric nature takes over (\\"Zer bosoms!\\") and the scenes where he frantically sings along with the dwarves is too funny to miss.<br />This is also very well-written; Pratchett is expert at giving us visions of what's going on, with a minimum of words used. There is no smut, no graphic violence, a little weird humor regarding the vampiric liking for women, and a bit of profanity, but kids can read this without fear.<br />This is not just a fun read for Discworld fans, but for fans of insightful satire and mystery in general.

While it might be possible to read \\"Tower\\" without having read the first John Bellairs book, \\"House With A Clock In Its Walls,\\" it is probable that newbies won't understand. So go read that book. Then come read this book.<br />Lewis Barnavelt and Rose Rita Pottinger are romping around a lakeside with their friends and relatives, but things are not going to remain peaceful. Someone attacks Uncle Jonathan - but steals nothing valuable from the house. Lewis sees strange visions of impending death: a banshee, a Japanese specter with a huge toothy mouth, and a hairy beast with glowing eyes that is stalking him in his dreams and in his waking life. He also learns of a note that says he will die on a specified day. Unsurprisingly, Lewis is very freaked out by this.<br />And on a boat trip out on a lake, our heroes encounter a strange, misty island with a giant black tower. And they find a new supernatural mystery that stems from their first adventure: the son of Isaac and Selenna Izard's son, Ishmael. And Ishmael is not only a sorcerer, but he fully intends to destroy the world.<br />Strickland inserts the elements of Bellairs that we all love best: Evil wizards, sinister dreams, vague reasons to destroy the world, unabashedly sinister surroundings, things that appear and vanish without warning, hideous beasties, and evil magic that the good wizards wouldn't touch with a ten-foot wand. He also manages to harken back to \\"House\\" without overloading the reader with too much \\"this is how it happened,\\" and manages to create a plot reminiscent of Bellairs' first book without repetition.<br />Characterization is seamless; Lewis and Rose Rita are just as we remember them, as are the ever-bantering Mrs. Zimmerman and Uncle Jonathan. So is the writing style, which remains spare unless something sinister is happening. If something hideous rears its head, the writing becomes creepily descriptive. My beefs? Well, there are a few threads that feel... well, un-picked-up by the end. A little too loose. In addition, one of the final scenes is somehow a little cheesy and a little too cute.<br />Few flaws aside, this is a wonderful spinechiller with a great climax, a deliciously BAAAAAD villain, and the quirky Bellairs heroes we know and love.riptive.

There are some areas that could use a little more elaboration, but overall it's very nice.<br />A young nobleman named Huldbrand ends up temporarily stranded at the home of a fisherman. There, he meets the fisherman's foundling daughter -- a beautiful, sea-obsessed, almost wild-seeming girl named Undine. Huldbrand falls helplessly in love with her, and after a priest is conveniently provided, the two are married.<br />But something sinister is lurking in the woods -- a skin-faced, eyeless, lipless demon that is stalking Undine. Though she and Huldbrand initially are happy at his vast estate, the demon has followed her. Increasingly frightened by his wife's strange ways and by the bizarre things that follow her, Huldbrand begins to wonder what she truly is and whether she is as innocent as she seems.<br />Mary Pope Osborne is best known for her younger reader books, the Magic Tree House series. But this book is for older readers, despite its short length. It'll scare some younger readers, there are some brief hints about the marital relationship between Huldbrand and Undine, and the kiddies may be bored stiff by the steady, gradual pace and the uneventful settings.<br />Writing is exquisite, detailed but not too detailed, evocative without requiring too much description. There seems to be a dreamy tint to even the everyday occurrances in this book, especially any scenes with Undine. Characterizations are a little thin -- at times, Huldbrand feels like the only truly 3-D character.<br />However, as adaptations go this is a great one. Definitely worth the read.	2002-04-13

This is the first book of six, a nice little series that I'd love to see in omnibus edition.<br />Randal is an ordinary squire in Doun until the day the wizard Madoc shows up. Without any clear reason why, Randal is attracted to the life of a wizard; a prophetic dream adds to this feeling. Madoc tries to warn him off, but Randal means it: He wants to be a wizard. Madoc finally takes him to the Schola, a wizards' school.<br />But learning magic and wizardry are not as easy as Randal thought. \\"Potential\\" does not mean that he will pass, and wizards are forbidden to kill, lie, or use a weapon. Randal finds it unbearably difficult to do even the most basic magic. He throws himself into his studies... but just as everything seems to be turning for the better, he finds himself face-to-face with a hideous threat.<br />Randal is the ideal hero for any kid who has struggled in school, not through lack of effort but from lack of understanding; he's smart, brave, gutsy, and sweet. He's supported by the enigmatic wanderer Madoc, his cheerful friend Nicholas, and the ragged musician Elys.<br />The older wizards are well-portrayed, being stern but kindly, strict but not rigid; the Schola is likewise, a place of great learning and magic, but also incredibly difficult to get through. Writing is very good as well; Doyle/Macdonald don't talk down to their readers, or dumb things down with the assumption that the kiddies can't handle anything more complex. They also put forth the neglected idea that just because you do badly at studies doesn't mean you're stupid, and that such things can be overcome more often than not.<br />Many authors can't pull off trying to tell a story in fragments of six, seven, eight small books. The end results are often poorly written and horribly characterized. Garth Nix can pull it off, and so can Debra Doyle and James D. Macdonald. This book is both well-written and well-characterized, and I'm looking forward to the next one.This book is both well-written and well-characterized, and I'm looking forward to the next one.	2002-04-12

With a title like \\"Eyes of the Killer Robot,\\" who could resist? While cheesy idiocy is implied in the title, the actual plot couldn't be further from it. This is an example of how Bellairs triumphs with his horror-fantasy stories, which so easily could descend into such ghastly cheese, but don't.<br />A stock-market plunge and a baseball game set off this book. Professor Childermass loses thousands of dollars in a sudden company collapse, shortly after it is announced that a star baseball player will offer ten thousand to anyone who can strike him out. It brings to Childermass's mind (he informs both us and the timid Johnny Dixon) an old memory: Of how a brilliant but insane inventor once offered a baseball team (which had Johnny's grandfather on it) a pitching robot. He strikes on the scheme of finding the robot and using it to strike out the baseball player (and cover his losses).<br />Unsurprisingly, this is not a Good Idea. They find the robot, but then Johnny sees a strange specter: An eyeless man who wanders around moaning, \\"They took my eyes.\\" The robot itself remains lifeless until a pair of strange glass eyes are put in its face. As it rampages through the town, the heroic trio make two other discoveries: Its inventor is not dead, and he's coming after Johnny with evil intent...<br />Bellairs is in top form here. Magic is mixed with the real world, and various occultic workings that wuill make your skin crawl. He does an especially good job with the villains: one is insane, and the other is frightening sane but absolutely amoral. As ever, his dialogue is snappy and his descriptive sense is either funny or just spinechilling; the settings are those of nice small towns with essentially pleasant people -- both of which can turn horrifying at any moment. His ghosts are simply unparalleled. And I agree with \\"Hallie\\" -- it takes a writer with guts and skill who can believably put his preteen hero in such realistic danger without outraging the reader.<br />Johnny is, as is usual with Mr. Bellairs, a meek but willing Charlie Brown type; I have yet to meet a reader of these books who doesn't like him or his counterparts. Fergie is a little more outgoing, the sort of dead-loyal friend that everyone wants. And the professor is... well, the professor.<br />Bad points? None that I can think of, except that the wonderfully crabby priest Father Higgins appears for only two pages.

Joan Aiken, best known for her \\"Wolves of Willoughby Chase\\" books, serves up a delightful fantasy/horror/comedy story that is sure to win over any fan of things that go bump in the night.<br />Cockatrices have invaded England. What are cockatrices? It's a general term for various malevolent, nasty, omnivorous beasties that arrived via luggage at an airport (hee!) and soon begin snorking up the unwary inhabitants. In a matter of years, people are hiding from them as they roam through England and lay waste to it. General Grugg-Pennington is given an order: Create an armored train and have a special corps of soldiers to deal with the cockatrices.<br />One of the people who volunteers is the boy Dakin -- Dakin is brought along because he plays the drums, and repetitive loud noises kill some of the cockatrices. Things become substantially more complex when Dakin's cousin Sauna ends up on the train as well. But something evil is massing in the north -- something connected to Sauna and the cockatrices, and something that will do anything to achieve its ends.<br />There are plot holes in this that you could throw a Flying Hammerhead through (why don't the people just leave England? Why can't they use an electronic recording instead of drums?) but somehow it never really matters. It's fun. Just fun. Aiken expertly mixes goofy Brit humor with a grimmer tone (sort of post-apocalypse-lite) in a newer kind of England where green leafy vegetables are a precious rarity and German dogs are imported to fight the Snarks. The flying sharks, the slightly dotty old lady, the pleasant old Brit soldiers, the apartment full of porcelain knickknacks, and so on. The plotting is tight; it gets darker as the book progresses, bringing in such old details as Michael Scott and covens of plotting witches.<br />Dakin is a suitably plucky everyboy, polite and dutiful and thoroughly sympathetic. Sauna is a bit more of a dark horse, as her ancestry and abilities are slowly revealed. The characters around them are less 3-D, but are great fun. There is some violence and creepiness, but nothing too major; this book may, however, scare some younger kids. The scenes with the eerie, almost ghoulish \\"Aunt Flossie\\" and her malicious rat were absolutely horrific.<br />Paper and binding are about average. My only beef? The cover! It's awful! Gris Grimly's drawings are quite good on the inside -- creepy and suitable, kind of a sharp-edged Edward Gorey -- ... In addition, the ending is a bit vague.<br />This is a really fun romp that kids will enjoy, and adults can chuckle over as well.na is a bit more of a dark horse, as her ancestry and abilities are slowly revealed.

Fans of legends, scary beasties, and strong heroines will find a fun read here.<br />Molly is having difficulties -- though her life is pretty normal, one Sunday she wakes up to find that her parents are missing. They haven't been found, no one knows where they are, but Molly is sure that they're alive and going to return. Social Services isn't as convinced as she is, and she ends up in the care of a formerly unknown great-uncle. Only problem is, this great-uncle (who is never named in the book) gives her a strange feeling. He's tall, bony, and sinister -- reminding her of an old legend about the carnivorous Skeleton Man, who tried to catch and devour his niece, before she was helped by a talking rabbit.<br />Her sense of foreboding grows stronger. She suspects that he's drugging her food and locking her door; strange dreams are haunting her, in which her stick-thin uncle wants her \\"fattened up.\\" Frightened and unable to get help (others consider her too imaginative), Molly must escape the clutches of what she suspects to be the Skeleton Man.<br />Frightening? You bet. Bruchac has good insight into the mind of a frightened, lonely young girl, but one with guts, initiative, and imagination. Molly is a heroine that kids -- especially girls -- will be totally sympathetic to. The rabbit is both sufficiently real and otherworldly, while \\"my uncle\\" displays sinister malice without any cheap tricks. It permeates every scene he's in.<br />The writing is fast-paced and devoid of \\"dead spots,\\" descriptions are highly evocative, and Bruchac displays dry wit in all the right places (\\"I don't need some furry Oprah Winfrey to tell me I need to get my spiritual act in order\\"). This book is pretty short -- only 114 pages -- and sometimes felt like it could use a little more length and buildup. There is also a lack of noticeable supporting characters, and I wish that Molly had gotten a best friend to bounce ideas off of. The inner illustrations (can't find the name of whoever did them) are soft-edged and slightly surreal.<br />Overall, an effective spinetingler that will not allow you to hear heavy footsteps without thinking \\"Skeleton Man!\\"cters, and I wish that Molly had gotten a best friend to bounce ideas off of.

1607410:US	50881246	R25P5I4R51A7XW	0399233687	900700036	Rowan Hood: Outlaw Girl of Sherwood Forest	Books	2	11	13	N	N	Falls flat	I thoroughly enjoyed the last two outings for YA by Nancy Springer, both Arthurian tales that added a dark and tragic tinge to famed but 2-D characters. \\"Rowan Hood,\\" a tale of Robin Hood's daughter in Sherwood Forest, doesn't really make me go \\"wow!\\" Maybe my expectations were too high.<br />Thirteen-year-old Rosemary lives with her woodwife mother Celandine (who is also part aelfe) in the forest -- until one day when the lord's horsemen ride in and burn the cottage -- and Celandine with it. Rosemary is left alone and with two options: Live in the woods and be killed eventually by the lord's men, or go to the village and be parceled off to a husband. She chooses the third option: Go off into the woods to find her father, the famed Robin Hood.<br />Rosemary disguises herself as a boy and heads off. Before long she encounters the mystical aelfe, a gentle giant with a gift for beautiful music, a princess running from an arrange marriage, and a wolf-dog who becomes her steadfast friend. And soon she finds that Robin Hood himself is in danger -- can she help?<br />Nancy Springer's use of atmosphere and mystical surroundings is as good as ever; she becomes a little less descriptive in ordinary surroundings. The actual plot is a strained idea in itself; and the product feels very bland and bloodless. It focuses less on characterization and more on the heroes dashing from one place to the next.<br />One of the problems is that I didn't find Rosemary particularly compelling as a heroine. Heroes like her are a dime a dozen in fantasy, and there are really no thoughts or responses from her that make her in any way interesting. The idea of a gentle giant is hardly new, but given a good twist by making him a master minstrel. The only problem arises when Springer overemphasizes his immaturity, such as whacking a knight on the head and saying \\"Meanie.\\" Ettarde is the worst character in the book, who seems to think constantly about how her father tried to marry her off and who doesn't have enough pizzazz. Robin and his band are pretty cool and believable, making me wish that Springer had written a book about a woman in THEIR camp instead.<br />A pleasant little tale, but don't go into it with expectations that are too high.sn't have enough pizzazz.

1611335:US	50881246	R3VGP2L8O9A2CB	0064404773	611302574	Beauty: A Retelling of the Story of Beauty and the Beast	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Fairy tale made real	The best-known and (perhaps) best-loved of Robin McKinley's books is also one of the best of the fairy-tale retellings. There's a depth and a richness to the story and characterizations, as well as a beauty of atmosphere and writing.<br />Beauty (real name is \\"Honour\\") is the ironically-named heroine of the story -- she isn't beautiful, but she is very intelligent. She has two sisters, the beautiful Hope and Grace, and a benevolent, wealthy father. Then all their lives change suddenly: the ships their father owns are lost, and the money goes with them. One of the sisters marries a poor but worthy country lad, while the other lost her beloved fiancee who captained one of the ships. After selling their possessions the family moves to a wild countryside.<br />The father leaves on a trip - and returns with a single rose, which carries the price of either his life or his daughter. Beauty leaves to go live at the castle of the mysterious Beast, with only her plowhorse to accompany her. She arrives at a castle of invisible servants, magical books, friendly animals, and a melancholy Beast who asks her to marry him every evening...<br />Beauty is a great heroine -- brainy, kind, wry-humored, brave and strong. Though the \\"Beauty\\" element is discarded, it is done so with the apparent understanding that while the traditional Beauty has no personality beyond her looks, this one has brains and guts rather than a pretty face. She seems like a very real teenage girl from the opening pages onward; her gradual caring for the Beast is handled slowly and carefully, but never in a boring manner. The Beast himself is a little more shadowy; we never get inside his head the way we do Beauty's, but then the book is hers, not his. His sadness permeates every scene he's in.<br />Beauty's father and sisters are well-done also. Her dad isn't an idiot or a nasty person, but instead is haunted. The sisters are, thankfully, kind characters even though they are beautiful and Beauty is not (a common book trap that McKinley avoids). There's none of the cartoonish nastiness of many other fairy-tale type books. At the same time, they keep their respective personalities: One of them is happy, and the other still remembers sadly her lost boyfriend.<br />The writing ranges well, since we have the more prosaic passages of cottage life and the surrounding friendly village, as well as the more dreamlike, fantastical scenes in the Beast's castle. Dialogue is flawless: We don't have any stilted formal prose, but it never screams \\"modern American\\" either. By the same token, Beauty is not the usual female hero. Too often strong female characters either lapse into stereotypical women-warriors, raving feminazis, or cocky \\"tough\\" girls. Beauty is merely a strong female character -- she is merely herself. For parents, there is no objectionable content -- no smut, profanity, frightening scenarios, or objectionable themes.<br />McKinley never lapses into \\"WOW, will you look at THAT!\\" when we encounter such things as future classics in the library, or invisible servants. Awe is put where it should be, such as in Beauty's glimpses of the outside world. (Wanna bet that Disney clutched a few elements from this book?)

The little captions underneath ARE pretty funny. We have Nixon wiping some lady's windshield, George Bush Sr. holding a hysterical baby, Bill Clinton and his bare-legged \\"advisors,\\" various pitfalls of Gerald Ford, Nixon and Elvis, Hillary, Powell, Buddy and Socks. (Yeah, the cat and the dog appear too)<br />Democrats may initially not want to buy this book, given the priceless Hillary pic on the cover. But this pic is there because it's the best one in the book, not because it's Hillary. Both parties receive equal hilarity, based on their unflattering moments rather than their politics (there is one repeat offender who is a running joke). Add that Buell inserts his dry comments throughout the book (he doesn't think politicians should hold babies, or as he puts it, \\"get into cute contests\\") which makes this a funny short read.	2002-03-19

This particular tale starts off very slow, but rapidly turns into a magical adventure at Chrestomanci's castle.<br />Gwendolen and Cat Chant lose their parents in a tragic paddleboat accident, and end up having to live with a mildly talented local witch. But it soon becomes evident that though Cat has no magical powers, Gwendolen has enough for several people. She's so powerful and skilled, in fact, that she attracts the interest of Chrestomanci, who has her and Cat brought to his castle. But then things start to deteriorate. Gwendolen is an arrogant, spoiled girl who seems to think that since she has magic, she isn't restricted by the same rules as the others. She isn't allowed to do magic, pick the plants, mouth off to Chrestomanci's kids or the teachers, she has to do math and ordinary lessons. Gwendolen finds that Chrestomanci, not her, is the ruler of the castle -- and she doesn't like that at all. (Oh yeah -- she also wants to rule the world) Cat likes being at the castle, is intimidated by Chrestomanci, and likes hanging out with Chrestomanci's two kids.<br />So she starts off on a one-witch campaign to make Chrestomanci notice and respect her: She infests the lawn with moles, causes apparitions in the windows, giant earthworms, fighting stained glass windows -- and then propels herself into another world, leaving her double with Cat. Cat must learn more about himself, his hidden power, and gain Chrestomanci's help before things get even worse.<br />This book starts off slowly -- the first twenty pages are pretty dull, chronicling the background of Cat and Gwendolen and how they came to live with Mrs. Sharp. Not very magical. But things pick up as soon as Chrestomanci comes into the picture, and the magical goings-on are sprightly and delightful.<br />As always, Jones shows great insight into kids' minds: Though Cat seems a little too passive at first, kids will like him, as they will the calm Roger and Julia. People who've read \\"Lives of Christopher Chant\\" will also see a familiar face in Chrestomanci's wife Milly. Chrestomanci is, as always, dapper and intelligent and cool-headed and thoroughly enjoyable.<br />Though this book is compared to Harry Potter, it's superior in every way. Jones never tries to dazzle us with wow-isn't-that-amazing? magic, and her jokes never descend to low humor -- for example, the dueling stained glass windows, and the earrings that scream \\"I BELONG TO CAROLINE CHANT!\\" so they'll never get lost. As this is another world where magic is prevalent over science (due to different events long ago), the magic is more casual. There is also respect for authority figures (Chrestomanci); kids who don't save the world entirely on their own, but do play a pivotal part in it; and her villains aren't bad just because they ARE: Gwendolen is merely a brat with magical powers.<br />This is a delightful fantasy book for all ages, especially for kids who feel oppressed by their siblings.

But you may not see him (or her) quite the same way after reading this book. It's a fun romp for kids, and may also be for adults with knowledge of Greek mythos.<br />Thirteen-year-old Odysseus and his best friend Mentor want to be heroes (actually, Odysseus wants to be a hero, and Mentor tags along) at the home of Odysseus's thief-king grandfather. After a partially successful hunt in which they help stop a monstrous boar, the boys are sent home across the sea -- except a storm washes them overboard, and leaves them stranded in a box in the middle of the ocean.<br />After they are captured by pirates, the boys find that they are not the only captives. There are a pair of princesses, the incredibly beautiful (but spoiled, petty and self-absorbed) Helen, and the less beautiful but clever Penelope. With the help of an incredibly smelly satyr and a self-rowing ship, Odysseus and his friends escape. But they inadvertantly stumble into more places full of things and creatures both astounding -- and terrifying.<br />This is a pretty fun read. It's a coming-of-age story/adventure story/mythological story, that takes up mythical threads and adds on to them as it skilfully shows the growth of the characters. The things such as Daedalus's lab and the boat that rows itself are done with exquisite atmosphere, as is the boar hunt and the semi-humiliating scenes that follow. Comedy, horror, adventure, and occasional awe are mixed in expertly.<br />Odysseus is reminiscent of Lloyd Alexander's Taran, with his brash eagerness to be a hero and a man among men, and his gradual maturation when he has to deal with actual danger. There's a good chemistry between him and Penelope; though it's not yet romantic, it's one of mutual respect and understanding which hints at their future relationship. Mentor is good as the voice of reason (except when Helen addles his mind) and Helen is great as a spoiled royal brat who thinks of her looks, suitors, and status as a princess. You WILL want to strangle her.<br />If your kids have ever enjoyed Greek legends, or if you're trying to interest them, this historical/mythical fantasy may be the ticket.ce of reason (except when Helen addles his mind) and Helen is great as a spoiled royal brat who thinks of her looks, suitors, and status as a princess.

Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, or Lloyd Alexander. And as good as parts of \\"Hero's Song\\" were, somehow it just didn't seem to click into the niche that would make it a classic.<br />Collun, the hero, is a gentle gardener in a rural village, living with his mother and his very distant father. His sister, however, is a more feisty and adventurous type, but then she vanishes at a party in another city. Collun's mother is devastated and horribly worried -- and even more so when Collun decides to go find her.<br />Collun ends up bringing along his bard friend Talisen to a nearby inn, where they encounter a warrior woman disguised as a boy, Brie, and a sinister morg that tries to capture Collun and kill Talisen. And as the three of them set out, they also pick up a mysterious wizard named Crann, and an ethereal Ellyl named Silien. They encounter more companions and dangers, as they approach the hideous Firewurme...<br />This book has definite promise  the usage of Irish myth, language and names are all expert, and some of the descriptions are breathtaking. Unfortunately, when you pare it down to the essentials, it is a pretty ordinary fantasy story with stock characters: we have the naive country hero, the tough warrior girl, the wisecracking sidekick, the wise old wizard, the ethereal elf... all of which we've seen elsewhere, and usually written better. And despite the extensive background for Eirren (Ireland, I presume) it feels very shallow. And the way that Collun and Talisen acquire companions is unimpressive  they run into people, and the people decide to come with them.<br />Dialogue is a big problem  with the exception of Talisen, at times, the characters all sound alike; their speech patterns are almost identical. The fat, cheerful innkeeper has the same speech pattern as the beautiful, mysterious Silien. And their personalities are very much the same: Collun doesn't really seem to have much emotion or drive, and his quest doesn't feel like there's much behind it. Brie is a typical woman-warrior, with a predictable past, and ends up being irritating rather than interesting. Silien and Crann don't really register either. Talisen is the one bright spot in the characterizations  he's charming, cute, annoying, and possesses the personal quirks that the others lack. And though Gwynned can't be described as a \\"bright spot,\\" he is more three-dimensional and striking to the reader.<br />The writing is admittedly very beautiful and well-done. Without being too descriptive, Pattou gives us pictures of the places, things and people that Collun and his friends encounter. So is the \\"maze riddle,\\" and the menace of the morgs and the strange evil queen.<br />As a previous reviewer noted, there are some teeth-gritting similarities to Lord of the Rings in places. But this story has no objectionable content, though some kids may be bored by the slower pace. It's a pretty generic story, without the richness of Tolkien's world, the quirky depth of Lloyd Alexander, or the charm of C.S. Lewis.

1621701:US	50881246	R9S3PDIANR5K0	0786815450	887909683	Merlin's Mistake (Lost Treasures)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Light Arthuriana	It's pretty hard to find original ideas about King Arthur, Camelot and Merlin. Original ideas that don't stink, that is. But this light little novel overflows with them, with tidbits of as-yet unknown info and a great, twisty storyline that leaves no loose ends.<br />Despite being an Arthurian novel, nothing takes place in Camelot and few of the characters are from it. Brian is an idealistic young man at an out-of-the-way castle, whose father was killed years before in the Crusades. (Nice intertwining of reality and fantasy) When a rather odd young man named Tertius appears, Brian jumps at the opportunity to come with him. Tertius's quest is to find someone who'll teach him magic -- the famed wizard Merlin tried, but made a mistake and so Tertius has no knowledge of magic, but plenty of knowledge about science (from the future, no less!)<br />Along the way, Brian clashes with a mysterious Black Knight that keeps a city paying tribute to him. There is supposedly a knight with a red shield, a sword, and certain emotional requirements who can defeat him; to find this mystery knight becomes Brian's personal quest. They are joined by a crabby crone and a strange Pict in their journey, venturing into great danger -- and finding unexpected allies.<br />Perhaps the main problem with this book is that it dashes from one scene to another, with relatively little time for character development. For most of the book, Brian feels underfleshed despite being the lead; characters like Maude, Tertius and Merlin are better defined and more individualistic, aside from nice-serious-minded-good-hero. The three of them have personality quirks that flesh them out, while Brian does not.<br />The writing is pretty sparse, but descriptions of action are good; the scene in Nimue's hall is worth it by itself, it's so amazingly written. And though the book initially seems lightweight, there are twists and mysteries in it that you will NEVER guess until you read to the end. Then, you'll smack yourself on the head and say, \\"of course!\\"<br />And the mix of fantasy and science is nice: the rather odd White Lady; the most unusual dragon; the pleasant forest thieves; and the Viking sword. And though a lesser author wouldn't have managed it, it never becomes tedious when Tertius blurts out some fact that nobody else understands, given that nobody knew what a quasar was back in medieval times.<br />Even if you're not an Arthurian fan, you may enjoy this tight little book. I sure did.urself on the head and say, \\"of course!\\" <br />And the mix of fantasy and science is nice: the rather odd White Lady; the most unusual dragon; the pleasant forest thieves; and the Viking sword.

One of the best of these early fantasists was Lord Dunsany, an Irish aristocrat who poured out his imagination into exotic, semi-mythic stories.<br /><br />He only wrote relatively few novels and novellas, but loads of short stories. And \\"Fifty One Tales\\" compiles the shortest of those stories, often meditations on death, joy, life and time. They're less like short stories than long vignettes, but they are striking.<br /><br />In this collection, Dunsany writes of sunken ships, of Fame's prediction to a young poet, the ghost of a workman, Death trying to frighten the legendary hero Odysseus, a king dreams of a beautiful queen who has been dead for forty years, and a Spanish pirate whose evil deeds mean that he isn't allowed to die.<br /><br />There is some dark humour in these stories as well, such as when Time comes across a man \\"antiquing\\" a wooden chair, and is a bit put out that his work is being done unnaturally. \\"Charon\\" is perhaps the most striking of these: the ferrymen of the dead is told by a dead passenger that \\"I am the last,\\" and finally breaks a smile.<br /><br />Not many authors could have such an impact with such short stories. Most of them are less than a page long, and sometimes they only focus on a minute or two. Despite this, Dunsany's excellent use of words paints some very, very vivid pictures.<br /><br />Usually Dunsany either made up his own legends, or sort of coopted vague Eastern myths as they were to the Victorians. \\"Fifty Tales\\" isn't quite the same; Greek mythology has a strong presence here, with Odysseus, Pan, Pegasus, Charon, Homer and Helen all either appearing or being referred to.<br /><br />Dunsany always had an excellent command of language, and he does a great job with \\"grey and watchful mountains,\\" \\"glaring factories,\\" and a world being choked by modernity. In one story, flowers cry out: \\"Great engines rush over the beautiful fields, their ways lie hard and terrible up and down the land,\\" and in another a poet cries out in sorrow because \\"the progress of modern commerce\\" has made his songs unwanted.<br /><br />Bittersweet and beautifully written, these fifty-one short stories leave behind the impression of a magical land that has faded away. Though not Dunsany's best work, it's still a classic.utiful fields, their ways lie hard and terrible up and down the land,\\" and in another a poet cries out in sorrow because \\"the progress of modern commerce\\" has made his songs unwanted.<br /><br />Bittersweet and beautifully written, these fifty-one short stories leave behind the impression of a magical land that has faded away.

All are written in Dunsany's incomparable prose, which ranges from arch first-person narrative to stuff that sounds like embellished mythology.<br />In this you'll find centaurs, sphinxes, master thieves, about-to-retire pirate chiefs, kings trying to move an emotionless queen to tears, a magical window, a pair of feuding idols, and a delightful story called &quot;Miss Cubbidge and the Dragon of Romance.&quot; The stories are a little short -- much shorter than most present-day short fantasy stories -- but they are just amazing. A must-read for immediate suspension of belief.	2002-03-13

Though some of the attitudes in it will make modern readers squirm a little, it remains an enjoyable read - if you can get through the 1000-plus pages of it. (My old mass market paperback has nearly 1500)<br />The book starts shortly after the Civil War, in a small but lively town in Ohio. Several young women are graduating from their local ladies' college, just as a literary society is being formed. It's a small but intelligent society, and it serves as the focus for these ladies as they marry, rejoice, suffer, have kids, live and die. A complete plot summary is impossible; this novel is so complex and widespread that it can't be done. There is no central plot; rather, it's as close as you can come to living and participating in that era.<br />The writing is pretty ordinary; flowery writing would extend this book to Bible-length. But somehow Santmeyer never loses track of her characters, what they're doing and who they are. The dialogue is both realistic and very alive: the extensive discussions about characters and places and political events never stay dull.<br />Why four stars? Well, as can be expected in a novel that spans 64 years, there are some \\"dead spots\\" that seem to drag on for quite a while. Also, Santmeyer tends to repeat herself sometimes. And, as this was written over the course of fifty years, taking place in the latter half of the 1800s and the early quarter of the 1900s, some of the attitudes toward women and African-Americans are... well, dated to say the least. If you are in favor of banning Twain's books, you shouldn't read this, accurate as it probably is.<br />But one unique thing is that though these women of the club (Not \\"ladies\\"! Not \\"females\\"!) begin in an era where women were thought to be lesser beings than men, they are portrayed as intelligent and very equal to the men. Some of them reminded me of the cast of \\"Little Women\\"; ... I do warn you - this is not a book for fluff reading, as the length will be enough to scare off many readers.<br />But if you have a great deal of spare time and a comfy place to read, you may enjoy this book.this is not a book for fluff reading, as the length will be enough to scare off many readers.<br />But if you have a great deal of spare time and a comfy place to read, you may enjoy this book.	2002-03-10

Rowling over the use of the word \\"Muggles.\\" Not being a part of the HP throng, I checked this book out and settled down to read. Eventually, I concluded that the lawsuit was needless. This book is bad on its own merits.<br />The essential plot is a postapocalyptic one, where bombs are falling on crumbling civilizations (which, weirdly enough, are composed of nobles?). First we're given a political run-through and a description of the Muggles themselves. Then we are told about a beautiful young noble woman named Lady Catherine, who sets her newborn sons afloat on the ocean. Helped by friendly sea creatures to Aura, the land of the cartoonish Muggles, the boys survive and are named Rah and Zyn. However, as years go by, Zyn becomes jealous of his brother. His increasing isolation with his band of hanger-on Nevils provides the central conflict of the plot.<br />This book never really decides what it wants to be - it reads like an \\"Early Reader\\" story stretched over nearly three hundred pages. Yet the descriptions of nuclear war, third-degree burns, radioactive mutation, and a mother setting her children floating in the ocean will scare some small children witless.<br />And to put it simply... it's just a terrible book. I knew I was in trouble when I read that Lady Catherine's nickname is \\"Cat.\\" The talking sea creatures made me cover my eyes. The rapidly changing enviroments (the arrival of the twins causes Aura to become fertile again) require a major suspension of belief, as does the rambling storyline - we get pages of irrelevant conversation and attempted humor. But the humor falls flat, the dialogue is virtually impossible to follow, the songs intrude on the storyline, and the Muggles read like the creations of someone forced to watch one too many hours of kiddie cartoons.<br />And the character development is nonexistant - we get pretty much nothing from the POV of either of the twins or an individual Muggle. In following pages I found that Rah and Zyn had no real personalities - they either emanate sinister evilness, or a sugary goodness. Ditto with the Muggles, who seem to live in a saccharine idyllic enviroment, like mutant hobbits on illicit substances. There's even an attempt to inject gratuitous romance into it, where we have the (beautiful, elegant, dull-as-ditchwater) Lady \\"Cat\\" dancing and flirting heavily with her butler only a few pages after her husband dies. Uhhh...<br />The writing style is worse than mediocre. While author-addressing-the-readers can be charming sometimes (such as \\"The Hobbit\\") it takes a skilled writer to pull it off. Too often Stouffer's tone comes across as cutesy and smug. Her writing never makes us care much about what's going on, because she never writes in any sense of urgency or genuine danger - the Nevils are an example of this. Evidently we're supposed to find them alarming, but I had a great deal of trouble not giggling. And for the love of Mike, why do the Muggles wear baby-esque clothes made out of \\"gingham\\"?<br />FYI, I am not a Harry Potter fan, but this is for its fans: This book resembles Harry Potter in pretty much no way, except for the plotline involving adolescent boys and the name \\"Muggle.\\" I can't imagine why Stouffer thinks that she can realistically sue Rowling over the use of this name. The hostility towards her is not the result of \\"big companies having power over people.\\" If this book deserved it, it would receive a wide readership - but alas...<br />If you want beautifully written books for young kids, try Jane Yolen's Merlin trilogy, TA Barron's \\"Tree Girl,\\" or Emily Rodda's \\"Rowan of Rin\\" series.

This story has a lot of the hallmarks of your average fairy tale -- a cruel Duke, a beautiful captive princess, and a young prince-in-disguise who (with the help of an eccentric mentor) wants to win her hand.<br /><br />But the story is not what ultimately makes &#34;The 13 Clocks&#34; such a spellbinding experience. That would be the language that James Thurber used to convey it -- he spun up a spellbindingly chilly, almost dreamlike world, and filled it with a whimsical mixture of prose and poetry (&#34;I resemble only half the things I say I don't. The other half resemble me&#34;). It's a bit like the tales that a small child would tell, only with the elegance and learned experience of wordcraft and storytelling.<br /><br />In the castle of the sinister Duke, time is dead. He claims to have killed it himself, since he &#34;was afraid of Now, for Now has warmth and urgency, and Then is dead and buried.&#34; He also keeps the beautiful Princess Saralinda prisoner there, and whenever a young man tries to win her hand, the Duke either kills him for some imaginary impudence, or gives him a terrible and impossible task like cutting a slice of the moon.<br /><br />Then a mysterious young prince arrives, disguised as a minstrel. After singing about mittens (forbidden, since the Duke is known for his jeweled gloves), the young man attracts the attention of the Golux (&#34;the only Golux in the world, and not a mere Device&#34;), who wishes to save him from being fed to the Duke's geese.<br /><br />But the Golux's attempts to help him aren't particularly helpful, since the Duke has learned the true identity of the minstrel-prince -- and he gives the Prince a truly terrible challenge. Not only must he bring back a thousand jewels within ninety-nine hours, but he must return just as the stopped clocks are striking five. Their only hope is Hagga, a woman cursed with the ability to weep jewels. But can the Prince and the Golux get a thousand gems from a woman who will never cry, or will they be consumed by the Todal?<br /><br />&#34;The 13 Clocks&#34; is a resolutely odd little story -- it has a simple magical quest, and the usual pursuit of a captive princess, a cartoonishly evil villain and magic spells. What makes it unique is James Thurber's eccentric writing (&#34;I am no longer ert, for I have lost my ertia&#34;) and feverishly starlit world, with a cold castle full of ghosts and invisible assassins, time's blood and the incarnate wings of Then taking flight. It's like stepping into a very slightly surreal fairy tale, told by someone who is just coming down from an acid trip.<br /><br />And Thurber's cleverness extends to made-up words that are strangely evocative (&#34;a blob of glup,&#34; or something that &#34;squutched&#34; and &#34;flobbed&#34;) and dialogue that often slips into a sort of chanting demi-poetry (&#34;Remember laughter. You'll need it even in the blessed isles of Ever After&#34;). And despite the spareness of his prose, he still manages to write exquisitely memorable descriptions (&#34;It makes a sound like rabbits screaming, and smells of old, unopened rooms&#34;). He doesn't dwell too long on the weird and enchanted, skimming over them as if the world he's writing is full of such starlit, shadowy, wild things.<br /><br />As for the characters, they are archetypes and Thurber clearly knew it -- our hero is a noble prince in the disguise of a minstrel, whose straightforward mind doesn't really know what to do in a crisis, and Saralinda is a luminous paper doll who exists to be won. The Duke is a villain who makes Bond villains look like philanthropists, with his single eye, uneven legs (from kitten-punting -- not kidding), jeweled gloves and constant declarations that he slew Time on a snowy night.<br /><br />The most endearing character? The Golux, who is not a mere device... or at least, that's what he says, because for the purposes of the story, he's definitely a device. The son of an alcoholic wizard and a mediocre witch, he's the quirky force that drives forward the story with his oddball advice to the Prince. On the flip side, there is the gleeping, musty horror that is the Todal, who causes spontaneous grey hair whenever it's even mentioned.<br /><br />Few fairy tales dip into the weird, snowy, starlit beauty of fantasy like &#34;The 13 Clocks,&#34; a seemingly straightforward story given enchantment through clever wordplay and the Golux... who is not a mere device.

Read this book, in which we see a princess unlike any other. I'm glad that it will be reprinted shortly, as a fantasy story this good deserves to be read again and again.<br />The story opens in the kingdom of Phantasmorania (great name, no?), where the seventh royal princess is born. At first, Amethyst Alexandra Augusta Araminta Adelaide Aurelia Anne appears to be like any other beautiful, good-tempered princess. But then a crabby but well-meaning fairy puts a two-edged blessing on her: \\"You shall be ordinary!\\" And she is. To the dismay of the royals and the court, Amy is mousy-haired, snub-nosed, freckled, and thoroughly graceless. She prefers romping in the woods to drifting around playing with a golden ball, as her sisters do.<br />Dismayed, her parents try to rig up a crisis to get her married off. But Amy doesn't want to be treated in such a way, and has no wish to embarrass her family. So she sets off across the woods, and enters a neighboring kingdom, where she becomes a kitchen maid and has to work for the first time in her life. There she befriends a squirrel and a bird - and a mystery \\"man of all work\\" named Perry, who becomes her best friend...<br />M.M. Kaye, best known for her tales of India and other exotic lands, pens a delightful little fantasy story. This is not an epic, nor does it have ground-shattering impact on the world. Instead it is a smaller, more personal story about an ordinary girl who happens to be a princess. Amy's love story is charming as well, since she and Perry CHOOSE rather than are chosen. It also adds an extra dimension to their romance, since they are friends as well. Amy doesn't give in to fate, she makes her own. I know this sounds like a feminist retelling, but it isn't. Believe me, there is no preaching in it - rather it glories in ordinary but overlooked virtues.<br />The kingdoms in this book are delightfully overstated. The people in the courts tend to be overstuffed, pompous, full of hot-air, and dripping with jewels and impractical clothing. The blonde, beautiful princesses do not have individual personalities, nor do most of the kings and so forth. The more sympathetic characters like Perry, Clorinda, and the crusty water-fairy are both more relaxed and casual, and more realistic. And younger girls will probably want their own Perry.<br />Writing is fairly un-detailed, but that is in keeping with the fairy-tale motif. Subtle humor is sprinkled through it, such as the fairy godmother's crusty but kindly attitude, and the joke about the prince of Kleptomania, who has to be watched carefully. The dialogue is realistic but never boring, especially when Perry and Amy are talking, or when the courtiers are gabbling among themselves.<br />Problems? Well, it's way too short. There's no sequel. And the new reprinting -- ay caramba, who chose that cover art? It makes Amy look about five years old - she's supposed to be a teen! I do hope they retain her delightful internal illustrations, including Amy's soggy grandmother, Perry, and the little house in the woods.<br />This enchanting story will leave you with a smile.

And T.A. Barron gives his densely, mythologically fantastical take on Merlin in \\"The Lost Years of Merlin,\\" a colorful and lushly-detailed novel about the teenage wizard's formative years. The \\"Star Wars\\" twist is rather predictable, but otherwise it's a delightful story.<br /><br />Years ago, the boy Emrys was washed up on the shores of Wales, along with an equally mysterious woman named Branwen. He can't remember her, or anything else from his prior life.<br /><br />And for some years, he and Branwen live in a small Welsh village, where they are reviled because of their strangeness. When some village boys attack Branwen, Emrys' magical powers are unleashed -- and he ends up blind, but able to use his \\"second sight.\\" Since Branwen refuses to tell him anything about his past, Emrys sets off on his own quest.<br /><br />He ends up on the shores of the magical land of Fincayra, where he meets the quirky woodland girl Rhia. Unfortunately, Fincayra is slowly being withered by a magical blight. With the help of Rhia and a diminuative giant named Shim, Merlin must find use his heart, brain, powers, and the mysterious Galator pendant to defeat the evil Rhita Gawr, find the Seven Treasures, and save Fincayra.<br /><br />T.A. Barron obviously loves two things -- myth'n'legends, and nature. \\"The Lost Years of Merlin\\" is soaked in both these things. He writes in a lush, intoxicatingly detailed prose, with the overhanging presence of living trees, cool leaves and wild magical places. It's a bit like wandering into an enchanted grove, and watching the epic story unfold outside.<br /><br />And like his prior novel \\"The Merlin Effect,\\" Barron laces it softly with Celtic mythology and Arthurian legend (such as the magic cauldron and the god Dagda), as well as some interesting ideas of his own (\\"historical\\" versus \\"sacred\\" time). The only problem is that Barron pulls a \\"Star Wars\\" twist out of his hat late in the novel, which is one of the few rampant cliches in here. Come on, couldn't he have done something a LITTLE more imaginative?<br /><br />And Barron's Merlin is a powerful reimagining of the legendary wizard -- this Merlin is a confused, outcast boy who is terrified of his own dangerous magic. Rhia is a likably quirky supporting character, just odd enough that she seems like a convincing forest baby, and there are a number of eccentric characters -- the Grand Elusa, Domnu and Cairpre -- that really draw in the reader.<br /><br />\\"The Lost Years of Merlin\\" is a striking, lushly-written fantasy novel that adds new mythical dimensions to our favorite Arthurian wizard.

The flaws are many and varied: the characters are paper-thin and occasionally laughable, the action is dull, about ninety percent of the stuff going on is ripped off from Tolkien, and the writing style and dialogue range from mediocre to downright silly. It's one of those books where you keep reading because it seems impossible that it could get any worse.<br />Tuck Underbank is the hero, a Warrow (hobbit, right down to meals and baths) living in the Boskydells (Shire) who is called out to aid the high king Aurion (Theoden?) and his son Galen (Aragorn) in defeating the evil Modru (Sauron) and his dark forces of rukhs, lokhs and ogres (orcs, uruk-hai and trolls) as well as the Ghuls (Nazgul) and Vulgs (wargs). Tuck teams up with a fiery dwarf Brega (Gimli) and a majestic elf warrior Gildor (Legolas) and is drawn into Gron (Mordor) to defeat Modru.<br /><br />The storyline of this trilogy is the same as Tolkien and many other fantasies: Heroes travel across land to defeat Big Bad Evil Villain. Emotional trauma. Battles. Magic. It's all laid out in Diana Wynne-Jones's \\"Tough Guide to Fantasyland.\\" Comparisons to Tolkien are, let's face it, inevitable...Even if this is a tribute, it's not even a GOOD tribute!<br /><br />This book lacks the texture of Tolkien's writing. There's none of the majesty and mystery. Additionally, he does not seem to understand that saying a character is a hero and telling us why is not enough to make us BELIEVE it. Let the person's actions throughout the book tell us why. And these characters, unfortunately, grow more paper-thin as the story progresses -- the more there are of them, the less we care. The character interactions range from ludicrous to nauseating, from the weird buddy-buddy dialogue of Tuck and his allies to his too-cute-to-stomach romance with Merrilee.<br /><br />The ripoffs are many and varied: ancient battle between good and evil is exactly like Tolkien's (including McKiernan's own Eru and Morgoth). The dwarf mine-city; tentacled beastie outside magical concealed doors; Balrog/Ghath; Boskydells; Warrows; the horn given to Patrel; the Elven retreat where our heroes rest for a while; several character names; amazingly dull \\"Elfess Rael\\"/Galadriel; the blue-glowing dagger-sword Bane belonging to Tuck... The list goes on and on. In addition, the characters have the outward appearance of the LOTR characters, but none of the depth: Tuck has all of Frodo's angst, but no reason for it; Modru is a caricature, Sauron without his menace; Galen has all of the commanding presence of Aragorn, but nothing to back it up; Brega has all of Gimli's stubbornness and occasional obnoxiousness, but none of his fire or dignity; Gildor is graceful and elegant, but has none of Legolas's quirky sense of humor, athleticism, humility or gentle teasing.<br /><br />Some elements are removed -- most notably Sam, Gandalf and the Ring. Unfortunately the gaps are filled by original elements. Events near the end, lacking a Ring, are utterly original -- and ludicrous. Tuck's love interest is Merrilee, who is one of the most annoying female characters I have ever read about. She goes alternately from weepy to a frenzied military advisor (who even lectures a seasoned general on tactics!). Patrel is actually a fairly nice character, but Danner is a pain: He's like a hobbit needing Prozac, perpetually taking offense and wanting to go out and kick Spawn...<br /><br />But perhaps the worst is Princess Laurelin, whom the male characters spend about half of the book praising and thinking about (\\"For the Lady Laurelin!\\") despite the fact that she never actually seems to DO anything. She's so relentlessly sweet and kind and lovely that she made my teeth ache. She is also a Damsel In Distress -- she's kidnapped, and spends many, many pages whining toherself and crying in the dark. (For all the complaints about Tolkien's women, they never were DiDs -- sometimes they even rescued the men!) Compared to the capable and tough Eowyn, Laurelin is helpless. There are sexist comments about women's importance and abilities, and Laurelin's preoccupation with her appearance -- they contradict his heavy-handed gender equality message in Book Two.<br /><br />McKiernan's writing is about equal to a 9-12 book, but kids will get bored quickly with the endless descriptions of castle construction, mountain passes, and the history of forts. The editing is terrible. When we're first introduced to Laurelin, her eye color is mentioned twice in the same sentence. Run-on sentences abound, and semicolons are used with abandon. There are references to good guys smiling and \\"showing teeth\\", which is usually considered menacing. Whenever one of the Warrows does or says something even vaguely amusing, everyone in the room falls over laughing. In addition, McKiernan constantly repeats himself: Tuck's eyes must be called \\"sapphirine\\" about ten thousand times. Ditto with hair color and clothing color. (Okay! Laurelin is blond! Igon wears red! We get it!)<br /><br />The characters spend too much time crying. Tuck is the worst -- every other page, he's sobbing, tearing up, or weeping about something or other. Another problem is dialogue. No one talks like these people do. Warrows switch from dialect to dialect: from Cockney to pirate to ordinary English -- and some accents I can't identify. Men and Elves switch between normal speech and formal speech, often in the same conversation and with no warning. And someone needs to tell Mr. McKiernan that it doesn't count as an ancient dialect if you spell words funny. (Example: \\"Hal! Heah Adoni cnawen ure weg!\\" as \\"Hail! High Adon knows our way!\\")<br /><br />I get the distinct impression that this is LOTR -- as Mr. McKiernan thinks it should have been written.

I thought it dated and dull, with its archaic language and details about medieval life. Now, after years of studying mythology, including the Prose Edda,  I can better appreciate it. It's not a GREAT book, but it is a good one.<br />Robin is the son of a knight, destined to become a knight one day himself - until he falls ill and loses the use of his legs. The plague is ravaging medieval England, and it claims several of the servants who were caring for him. Robin is rescued by a kindly monk, Brother Luke, who takes the crippled boy to a local monastary and patiently cares for him there. Under Luke's guidance, Robin learns how to swim, read, whittle, and how to become a humbler person rather than the rather snobby noble boy that he once was.<br />But all is not well in England. Robin must \\"open a door in the wall\\" -- the walls that hemmed him in when he lost the use of his legs -- and discover that you don't necessarily have to be a knight to serve your king and country.<br />This is not a 9-12 book. Oh, not because of any objectionable content or attitudes, but simply because the, majority of 9-12 children will be bored witless by it. It's better suited to young adults who can handle the gradual pacing, softened archaic language (a fair number of twills, thous, amisses, and arts) and virtually actionless plot. As a result, \\"Door in the Wall\\" resembles a a slice of real life from the POV of a crippled boy rather than a fictional story. Such gruesome details as the plague and the violence of war are smudged out, by the way.<br />It seems a lot longer than its 120 pages. Ignore the silly cover art, the characters aren't like that at all; the interior illustrations are soft and realistic. de Angeli's writing lacks detail much of the time, but her dialogue is well-scripted. Robin's responses to the loss of his legs, his plans, and fear of his father's disappointment are perfectly done. He isn't a perfect lead character; he gets irrational, angry, snobby - but overcomes all of them. Brother Luke seems a little too perfect at times, but is also a good character. So, for that matter, is minstrel John-go-in-the-Wynd. (Yes, this book has those delightful Middle-Ages names based on the job, physical characteristics or past experience)<br />As for complaints about this book: Note that virtually all of them say that it was a schoolwork book; once again, we have disgruntled students seeking \\"revenge\\" on a non-fluff book that they had to read.

Let me simply say that I was left unimpressed - and often disgusted - by the stories in here. There are some good ones, but they are few and far between. (Do not be led astray by the pretty cover art! It is pretty, but that's almost all it has going for it)<br />We start with an icky poem by Jane Yolen; then a groanworthy Mercedes Lackey story &quot;The Cup and the Cauldron&quot; -- it stars girls and yes, has more Christian-pagan stuff if you're as sick of that as I am; an incoherent Andre Norton story &quot;That Which Overfloweth&quot;; Marion Zimmer Bradley's equally groanworthy feminist-Goddess-server &quot;Chalice of Tears.&quot; We hit something far better in Diana L. Paxson's &quot;Feast of the Fisher King,&quot; which is both well-written and entertaining, as well as being in play format; also Brad Strickland's enjoyable elf-fantasy-Arthurian story &quot;Gift of Gilthiliad.&quot;<br />Then it's back into &quot;groan&quot; territory with Ilona Ouspenskaya's gypsy tale &quot;Curse of the Romany,&quot; where you wonder what-the-heck-does-this-have-to-do-with-it? James S. Dorr's &quot;Dagda&quot; is pretty; Gene Wolfe's odd &quot;Sailor who Sailed After the Sun&quot; is another where you wonder what the relevance is; Lee Hoffman's indifferently-written western-fantasy &quot;Water&quot; takes a long time to get to the point, as does Alan Dean Foster's &quot;What You See...&quot; and Richard Gilliam's &quot;Storyville, Tennessee&quot; and Jeremiah Phipps' &quot;Hell-Bent for Leather&quot; (are you seeing a pattern of irrelevance here?)<br />Lisa Lepovetsky pens another icky poem; Orson Scott Card's &quot;Atlantis&quot; stretches indefinitely; Dean Wesley Smith's &quot;Invisible Bars&quot; is pretty amusing; Janny Wurts bores and annoys with &quot;That Way Lies Camelot&quot;; Kristine Katherine Rusch's &quot;Hitchhiking across an Ancient Sea&quot; is a pale, pale short story; Lawrence Watt-Evans's story has a good idea, but is poorly written; Lionel Fenn's &quot;The Awful Truth in Arthur's Barrow&quot; is just plain bizarre, as is Brian M. Thompson's &quot;Reunion.&quot; Margo Skinner redeems the poetry angle with &quot;Quest Now&quot;; Neil Gaiman's &quot;Chivalry&quot; is enchanting; Bruce D. Arthurs is weird again in &quot;Falling to the Edge of the End of the World&quot;, same with Rick Wilber's &quot;Greggie's Cup.&quot;<br />As you can see, this mixed bag tends toward the dull, irrelevant, pretentious and just poorly written. Half the stories seem to have the Grail thrown in (if it's there at all) just as an afterthought. Except for Margo Skinner's poem, the poetry all stinks; only a few of the stories retain the beauty and prose that one espects to see in an Arthurian story.

Her hero Rowan will win over the earnest bullied kids, or the people who once were.<br />Rowan is the most timid child in the village of Rin, and so he is often teased and bullied by other children. Adults pity him or dislike him for his apparent weakness. He is also is a herder of the bukshah (buffalo-like creatures who provide milk and wool), who are fed by a certain stream coming down from a nearby mountain. And, it is said, a dragon lives at the top of the mountain. One day it's discovered that the mountain stream is drying up. Without it, the bukshah and the village will both die. They consult old Sheba, a clearsighted wise woman who utters a cryptic rhyme: Seven hearts the journey make/Seven ways the hearts will break/Bravest heart will carry on/When sleep is death and hope is gone...<br />The village sends six of their strongest, bravest men and woman - and Rowan, who is the only one who can use their map. Coming along is Strong Jonn, half-Traveller Allun, inseparable companions Val and Ellis, Marlie, and Bromden. More prophetic verses crop up in the map, leading the way through dens of enormous spiders, bogs where they hear their loved ones' voices, right to the cold summit of the mountain. But Rowan and his companions will learn some lessons about fear and courage...<br />Reading this book, one sees so many ways that it could have gone wrong. The adults could have remained one-dimensional and snobbish - but they don't, they grow and change as Rowan does. Rowan could have been a little twit - but he wasn't, instead being a thoroughly believable young boy who WANTS to be brave. I liked how he was not bitter about being pitied or teased by the others, but merely needed a chance to prove himself.<br />This is probably too \\"young\\" a book for most 9-12 readers, as the inside flap describes it as 7-up. But despite being a very straightforward story of about 150 pages, it's also tightly plotted and well-interspersed with fantasy elements, though not too many. Rodda's descriptive style ranges from poetic to sparse, and she includes hints of the the adventures to come.<br />On to read \\"Rowan and the Travellers.\\" I'm sure it won't disappoint.very straightforward story of about 150 pages, it's also tightly plotted and well-interspersed with fantasy elements, though not too many.

This book is of an entirely different niche of fantasy, close to the lush prose and perpetual descriptions of beauty of Patricia McKillip. \\"Mute\\" is not what is often called \\"an easy read,\\" meaning that it is not the kind of book where you can predict all twists and turns. The story itself is fairly straightforward, but feels more complex than it is. It is also not really an \\"epic\\" fantasy, in that while the events of it are important and widespread, the focus feels more on the heroine.<br />The nameless amnesiac stumbles through a forest and into a bunch of poisonous plants, whose leaves eat into the mute's face. The mute is then rescued by a crabby old woman who nurses him to health -- but he still is voiceless, without memory, and his face is so deformed that he has to go about his duties  with a baglike cover over his head. He is mocked and maltreated, with a few nuggets of kindness from the people living there. But unseelie wights (evil creatures) are growing in number and encroaching on the places of good people - and a sinister lord sends the youth running for his life. He takes the opportunity to find a wise-woman named Maeve One-Eye, who may be able to restore his mangled face.<br />But after falling in with and escaping from pirates, the youth discovers a shocking fact - HE is in fact a SHE, a lie told to the girl to keep her from being treated even worse. She is also given the name Imrhien from an adventurer named Sianadh, who helps accompany her on her quest through the world of Erith for her memory, her name, and her true face. Then Imrhien encounters strange creatures both good and bad, and a kind Dainnan warrior named Thorn...<br />It's impossible to talk about this book without mentioning the imagination of this author. Great winged horses called Eotaurs, a magical metal that enables things to float and creates airships, legends and fairies reminiscent of British myth. All of this is seamlessly woven together without the air of \\"wow, look what I'm doing with this!\\" that too many authors inject into their work. If you love mythology and legends, you will probably smile a lot while reading this.<br />Some of the content may be disturbing for children, but it ought to be fine for adults and teens. In addition, the flowery prose may throw off readers with short attention spans and a longing for action, swords, sorcery and gore. If you don't consider LOTR a classic, and can't handle \\"Ombria in Shadow,\\" then you will not like this book. Though it is an exaggeration to claim that intricate detail is taken with everything, the descriptions are quite long -- when a wedding is taking place, two pages are devoted to the clothing of the bride, groom, and some of the guests. These should have been edited a little more, but these instances of excessive description are quite rare.<br />The flowery prose does not, however, become too aware of its own lyricism. The characters tend to talk like real people, and there are characters as undignified and bizarre as those in real life. The community of kitchen staff in a castle in a magical land reminded me a little of \\"Book of Atrix Wolfe\\": very real, both the good and the bad, especially the scene where they huddle around and tell stories.<br />I would also like to respond to a few of the criticisms levelled at this book: I did not find the scientific names to be distracting -- there's enough mix of reality and fantasy in this that it didn't bother me. And as for complaints about the lack of a quest - this is part one of a trilogy, centering on an amnesiac, and the quest appears to be one that will spill over into the following books. And the threat is nothing so crude as a Dark Lord in silly black armor, rather a feeling that creeps in with the unseelie creatures as their presence slowly becomes known and relevent.<br />I look forward to the next two books of the Bitterbynde trilogy, and any other books by Dart-Thornton. A unique story, beautifully told. (And no, I won't tell you what a bitterbynde is. You have to read and see for yourself)ornton. A unique story, beautifully told.

Katherine Roberts's works came to my attention a few months ago, when I read this and \\"Spellfall\\" (also a delightful book) and found a fantasy far better than HP. Roberts combines beautiful prose, an invented \\"Singer\\" community and their array of Songs, and half-creatures like something out of old legends and myths.<br />The Singers live on the Isle of Echoes, where they are taught in how to use various songs that affect others - the dream song of Challa, the laughter of Kashe, the pain song of Shi, the fear song of Aushan and the death song of Yehn. Rialle is one of the most gifted of the Singers, a young girl who hears the \\"half creatures\\" crying - the merlee. What she can make out are cries of pain and grieving. Rialle's jealous classmate Kherron goes off wandering by himself - and finds a shipwrecked sailor who rapidly pulls him into a grotesque situation. When the sailor's compatriots find and capture the merlee, Kherron is forced to gut the half-creatures and extract their eggs.<br />Rialle is soon sent off on a ship with the Second Singer (the second in command?) to the mainland. Along the way she finds that her ex-Singer friend Frenn has stowed away, and she also dives overboard, where she frolics with the merlee. But she senses their pain and grief soon after she is brought back onto the boat. Upon arriving at the mainland, she soon finds that other half-creatures -- quetzal, half-birds -- are being destroyed by the evil forces at work there...<br />In a way the Singers are reminiscent of the Jedi knights of Star Wars -- taught in special arts that they must guard and use carefully, feared by some, and lacking the ordinary familial structures (children born in the Echorium are raised by the organization). It's an intriguing arrangement, and the idea of the Songs is excellent. (The rhyme that goes with them isn't bad either)<br />Rialle's initial naivete both makes her endearing for the reader, and helps us see her grow more experienced and wiser as the book progresses. Frenn is a good counterpart/sidekick, tougher, cocky, and sometimes a little sad; the scene where he attempts the Songs on the boat is heartbreaking. Kherron is best described as the rebel who has to deal with getting what he wanted. His growth as a character is even more pronounced than Rialle's; he has the rare quality of a character that you are fascinated by and understand, even if he is not initially a sympathetic character.<br />Roberts' prose runs into downright flowery for a kids' book; some of the best passages include such things as Rialle's swim with the merlee. This book is not for squeamish or easily-frightened children, however: they might be disturbed by such sections as Kherron having to remove eggs from the dead merlee, lots of blood, and the quetzal eating parts of the dead priests.<br />Kids and teens with imagination (and a high squeamishness tolerance) will adore this book; adults will probably enjoy it as well, as Roberts' invented universe is far more original and amazing.

I have never been involved with \\"Dungeons and Dragons\\" and similar RPG games, so perhaps there was something in this book that I didn't get. But as a fantasy on its own, I found it to be dull, plodding and badly characterized.<br />We plunge straight into the plot with little fanfare. Arvin Rizalli is the main character, a young boy who is going with his friends - and his Mom - on a cyber-adventure. But the Rasmussem program is not like any ordinary video or computer game - it plugs directly into the brain. It feels as real as real life does. Arvin and his friends (I use the term loosely) are Generic Elves, Generic Dwarves, a Generic Wizard, Generic Thieves, and an American Indian warrior. (Don't ask) For a while all is fun and games (pun intended). They battle sinister creatures in a typical S&S world, but then something goes incredibly wrong...<br />I have read and liked other Vivian Vande Velde books, and this is an exception. I'm not too clear on why I disliked it. I found her other books to be witty and entertaining. This simply stumps along, without making the reader really care about the characters.<br />The writing is mediocre. We leap straight into the plot with little feeling for the protagonist or his buddies. Descriptions are pretty minimal, and what there is is mostly filtered through Arvin's eyes (or, if you prefer, Harek Longbow's eyes). The characters constantly debate what they're going to do, resulting in a lot of realistic but dull dialogue about what spells, skills or actions they plan to use. No surprise at all.<br />The characterizations are almost all flat. The characters (who all act essentially the same) bicker and snap at each other -- with the exception of Mom -- and sooner or later I wished a cave troll would crash in and squish them all. They were that unsympathetic. The book also sort of fizzles to the finale, rather than a heart-pounding build-up. I couldn't feel any real emotion.

But I was pleasantly surprised by this collection of short stories -- they tended to be tighter, better-written and often funny or cute. And even if I didn't dislike them, they didn't annoy me as much. (Methinks McKiernan's talents are better suited to small, personal stories rather than epic sagas)<br />This series of stories opens in the One Eyed Crow, a Warrow pub, during a really horrible blizzard. As a result, the people in it end up telling stories to each other to pass the time and occupy their minds. Among the first is \\"The Thornwalker and the Wolf\\", a nice little story about a Warrow who ends up in a wolf den during a snowstorm. \\"Trout of the Rillmix\\" is touching, but telling any more would ruin it. \\"Ruffian and the Giant\\" is amusing in places, but overall feels kind of strained and hard to follow. \\"Agron's Army\\" has three things going for it -- tight plotting, an intriguing conclusion, and some passages from the POV of one of Modru's Hloks. \\"The Helborne Drum\\" was something I didn't understand at all. \\"The Transformation of Beau Darby\\" was very, very cute, especially for the people who liked the \\"Hel's Crucible\\" duology. \\"The Dammsel\\" is sad and sweet. \\"For Want Of A Copper Coin\\" is also cute, a nice little story about a Warrow competing with a Man.<br /><br />What's the problem? Well, interspersed through these stories are three interconnected tales that lead up to \\"Eye of the Hunter.\\" (I haven't read it, but I know what it's about) This follows an Elf lady (I refuse to use the term \\"Elfess\\") named Riatha, a shapeshifting Baeran named Urus, and a pair of Warrows named Tomlin and Petal as they hunt the horrifying Baron Stoke, a psychotic sorcerer who has killed loved ones of each one of them.<br /><br />Despite the unfortunately tendency of Mr. McKiernan to give us dull travelling details, I enjoyed these stories until I started recognizing details from them. If you've read tales about J.R.R. Tolkien's Huan, Luthien and their showdown with Sauron (who also appears as a werewolf, then in bat form, was keeping a love interest captive), you'll see some striking similarities to events in those three stories. That sort of spoiled them for me. And I felt the epilogue was a little too much.<br /><br />The writing varies from story to story.

A nice read if you want some variety or if you're a fan of the series. But I really do think that McKiernan needs to write shorter, smaller-scale, more interpersonal books.

I was pleased that my fears were needless. Michael Hoeye has not lost his touch that was so evident in \\"Time Stops For No Mouse\\". (And I recently found out that these books are being republished in hardcover by Putnam -- congratulations, Mr. Hoeye!)<br />The story is a sequel (but not slavishly so) to the first book of the series: Cats are a taboo item among the mice where Hermux Tantamoq lives, supposedly mythical creatures. So when his friend Mirrin displays cat paintings, people are -- to put it mildly -- upset about it; the mayor is even going to clamp down and ban it, and a large group of mice get together to prevent it from opening.<br />Then a chipmunk named Birch Tentintrotter arrives. Years ago, Birch was chased away for ownership of a map leading to a city of cats -- and now he's back. Birch leads the heroic mice (including Linka Perflinger and Hermux) to find the tomb of Ka-Narsh-Pah -- but problems are following them, in the form of two very determined villains.<br />Familiar faced abound in this book, from the previous one. Mirren, Linka, and Tucka are the most prevalent among them - it's great to see the artist, aviatrix love interest and cosmetics creep once again. Even so, it's not too necessary to read the first book to read the second (I advise it anyway, if nothing else because it's also delightful).<br />And the originality of Hoeye's plotlines continues. The idea of mice seeing cats as mythical creatures is inspired, as is his subtle dealing with controversial art (and the elite wanting to see it); also great is the idea of a revisionist-history villain. Any person who hates the editing of history will be grinning at the portrayal of Hinkum Stepfitchler.<br />His writing is as charming and descriptive (but not TOO descriptive) as it was in the first book. Hermux is endearing and humble as ever. Linka, Mirrin and Birch are all delightful as well. The dialogue is cute, but not TOO cute, and unlike many authors Mr. Hoeye seems to have no trouble keeping the separate personalities of the characters from running into each other.<br />Fans of Redwall, Avi animal books, and the prior book in this series will eat this right up; those of you not into anthropomorphic fantasy may want to change your minds. Here's hoping for lots more of Hermux Tantamoq.alogue is cute, but not TOO cute, and unlike many authors Mr. Hoeye seems to have no trouble keeping the separate personalities of the characters from running into each other.<br />Fans of Redwall, Avi animal books, and the prior book in this series will eat this right up; those of you not into anthropomorphic fantasy may want to change your minds.

1659590:US	50881246	RG8L75W1O5X5Z	0762409541	397834751	Hobbit's Journal: Being A Blank Book With Some Curious Illustrations Of Friends And Foes Of The Nine Companions (Parchment Journals)	Books	2	21	27	N	N	Adequate if you have no strong feelings	Full agreement with prior reviewers who pointed out: This is not a book by J.R.R. Tolkien, any more than a blank book with Obi-Wan Kenobi on it is by George Lucas. It's simply a very short blank book with some illustrations (which are, BTW, not by Tolkien either).<br />It's very short, as blank books go, and I thought the illustrations were a bit off. Not simply because I envisioned most of the characters differently, but because such characters as Legolas don't resemble humanoids at all. (Elves are supposed to have noses, ya know). Other characters simply don't look right -- I thought Boromir was all wrong, for example, and Bilbo and Gandalf too. The paper is of nice quality, though.<br />Some of the accompanying illustrations were nice, but others (such as the unicorn) simply looked odd. The title is misleading -- you would expect for this to be the adventures through Sam's eyes, but all it has is a brief blurb about him, and that's it.<br />I don't really recommend this as either a blank book or a Tolkien fan's possession. It just isn't worth it.	2002-02-10

As his parents are dead, he lives with his horrible relatives: Uncle Bernard, Aunt Dot, Cousin Ronald and his wife Astrid, and the sinister housekeeper, all of whom insist that he be grateful to them. They tell him what to wear, how to speak, what to do, constantly talk about what a burden and a pain he is, and spend the rest of the time listening to Astrid and Bernard compare imaginary ailments.<br />While out doing yardwork, David utters a gibberish curse -- only to have a nearby wall erupt in a shower of snakes. Another boy named Luke appears, and offers to help David. Why? He says that David freed him, and David goes along with this. Luke charms David's nasty family, and as a result Astrid slowly begins to befriend David.<br />But Luke quickly displays that he can be dangerous as well as helpful. And he is strangely wary of the new people in the neighborhood: the Frys, one-eyed Mr. Wedding, and sinister gardener Mr. Chew. He claims that he was framed for something he didn't do -- but how is David going to help him?<br />Perhaps the only drawback of this book is that you need some basic knowledge of Norse mythology to know who people like the Frys, Mr. Wedding and Luke are; those who are not familiar with the myths may be hopelessly lost. So brush up on the basics before reading. As for the finale -- well, you'll definitely need to know about Norse myths. Jones doesn't tell us too much, but she doesn't tell us a lot either. The three old women will be recognizable easily, though: Similar characters have been featured in many other works of fantasy.<br />David is a completely realistic young boy, and I was pleased to see the \\"conversion\\" of one of his annoying relatives. Luke manages to be sympathetic and interesting despite the fact that he's a little amoral and has a perilous sense of fun. I was also glad that the \\"nasty relatives\\" didn't fall into the Roald Dahl/Harry Potter trap of being cartoonishly bad. They're bad because they are rigid and disdainful -- nasty in ways that are almost hilariously realistic. (The scene where David keeps score as Astrid and Bernard compare psychosomatic problems is a hoot!)<br />Soon to be reprinted, this is a lesser-known gem that is often overshadowed by Jones's other more popular works. Though shorter than many of her other books, this is a great read for adults and kids alike..fact that he's a little amoral and has a perilous sense of fun.

Three-dimensional characters, flowing plot, flowery prose all meld together into a satisfying novel.<br />Gloom and shadow fall over the city of Ombria as its ruling prince lies dying, leaving four people in the palace: Kyel, his child-heir who is traumatized by the loss of his family and friends. Lydea, the prince's mistress from a tavern, who genuinely mourns him. Domina Pearl (also called \\"Black Pearl\\"), an ancient, hideous, deathless, inhuman woman who seeks to control Kyel for her own power over Ombria. And Ducon Greve, the prince's silver-eyed nephew, whose father is a mystery and who expresses himself through charcoal drawings.<br />When the prince dies, Kyel becomes the new prince -- but not before Domina Pearl throws Lydea out of the palace, and she flees to her father's grimy tavern -- only to find that she longer belongs there, but that she never belonged at the palace either.. Ducon is asked by nobles to try to overthrow the Black Pearl, but his sole concern seems to be for Kyel's safety, and he cannot act if it could hurt his young cousin. And in the \\"undercity,\\" the sorceress Faey (who is definitely not human) is hired to \\"undo\\" Ducon -- except her waxling Mag (a living creature formed from wax) doesn't want Ducon to be killed.<br />But the political strife is only a portent of things to come. It's all linked to strange, ancient events that start with \\"perilous times, a desperate city, the ruling house in chaos, in danger.\\" It's all linked to Ducon, Domina Pearl, Mag, a locket of blood and rose petals, a children's tale, and the shadow.<br />Like many of her recent books, this book focuses on several individuals whose lives interconnect within the main plot. As for the plot itself, well, expect the unexpected. In some ways it resembles \\"Song for the Basilisk,\\" a prior book of McKillip's, with its mingling of magic and politics; also, Domina Pearl is in some ways reminiscent of the Basilisk, with her aura of quiet, stifling malevolence. But while the plotline of \\"Basilisk\\" was politics fueled by magic, it's the reverse here, magic fueled by politics; also, while the Basilisk was the figure on the throne, Domina Pearl is the power behind the throne. The \\"shadow city\\" is freshly created and beautifully explains certain plot points.<br />Like Morgan of the Riddle-Master trilogy, Ducon Greve is a quiet person who doesn't particularly want to get involved in earthshaking events, but has to anyhow. Lydea's growth is also well-done, as she tries to help Ducon and Kyel. Mag is a little more difficult to connect to at first, as she seems to think in a manner entirely differently from Lydea and more like (but not exactly like) Ducon. As the book unfolds, we do see more of her emotions and feelings. Faey is one of the most original characters -- we're never entirely sure what she is or what her motivations are, aside from herself. But that never makes her unsympathetic or hard to connect to.<br />McKillip's writing is, as always, lush and detailed without being smothering. Her dialogue ranges from beautiful and poetic to downright funny in a few places, down to Kyel playing with his little puppets. And we have yet another gorgeous Kinuko Craft cover (look carefully for the black pearls in Lydea's hair).<br />This will probably be one of the best fiction releases all year, a tale of power-seeking, magic, the cycles of history, ghosts, shadows, and underground sorcery. A treasure.in some ways reminiscent of the Basilisk, with her aura of quiet, stifling malevolence.

But when a sinister demon, Guxx Unfufadoo, is conjured up -- the worst kind, a rhyming demon, whose power grows with every rhyme he utters. (Fortunately he's not too good at it) And Ebenezum manages to survive Guxx's attempt to kill him. But he soon discovers that Guxx has made him allergic to magic: whenever he's near magic, he starts sneezing uncontrollably.<br />After self-treatment fails (miserably) Ebenezum concludes that he can only be cured in Vushta, the City of Forbidden Delights. Wuntvor, being a typical teenage male, has no problems at all with this. But their way is fraught with peril -- much of it with silly dialogue, beautiful girls, and more than a few lunatics. Along the way they will encounter a singing-dancing dragon, a used-weapons dealer (who is also a demon), a mildly crazed warrior Hendrek with his club called Headbasher, Death in a game-show setting (\\"Now, Wuntvor, are you ready to double your lifespan?\\"), a cult that worships Plaugg the Fairly Magnificent, trial by custard, and demons trying to invade the world from the supernatural Netherhells.<br />As you can tell, this is not a particularly serious book. It reads like a series of loosely interconnected vignettes (because it was originally published that way) but somehow the episodic tendencies never bothered me. Every chapter is started with a hilarious quote from the Teachings of Ebenezum.<br />The humor ranges from the character oriented (Wuntvor's perpetually hormone-addled state) to the wry and funny (the hideous torment of aspirin commercials) to the low (\\"Neebekenezer's Syndrome of Universal Flatulence\\" and the chicken that... well, never mind).<br />The humor generally stems from the characters (Wuntvor's perpetually hormone-addled state) or the silly situations (Ebenezum being chased out by Grandmother) or the delightful dialogue (\\"What rhymes with silver?\\" \\"Orange!\\") such as Ebenezum critiquing Guxx's terrible rhymes. (\\"There is no justice in the cosmos. At least no poetic justice.\\")<br />The characters are hilarious: Ebenezum is the archetypical wizard, with a few secrets and flaws up his voluminous blue sleeve. Wuntvor is the character we see the world through, but he is as quirky as Ebenezum in his own realistic manner: He falls for every pretty girl nearby, looks forward to Vushta, and is a little too gangly and earnest for his own good. Supporting characters (with the exception of Snarks and Hendrek) are generally not developed as well, since they often vanish after a few chapters. This book is okay for most kids and all teens -- a few kisses between Wuntvor and his various love interests is about all that is objectionable.<br />It's fantastic that this book is back in print.

It'll tell moviegoers background tidbits not in the movie: why Sam is fascinated by Elves, what happened to Frodo's parents, that Legolas is a prince, what Elrond's ancestry is, and Gandalf's true nature.<br />We are filled in less so on places: Lothlorien itself gets only four paragraphs. Individual species get more space: We hear about the history of the human Men of Middle-Earth, about the habits of the hobbits, and the &quot;leaving these shores&quot; comment about the Elves.<br />I would like to remind some of the other reviewers that many people -- adults and children -- have not read the books and this book is probably for them. So to give away massive spoilers concerning Moria would be very bad news. (Just as this book doesn't let us know what happens to certain characters) So it's inevitable that some parts of the plot, especially those that hinge the plot, will not be revealed. Some clues about events in &quot;Two Towers&quot; are given -- look carefully. The pictures are very good, very well chosen -- the ones of Frodo and Sam in particular.<br />Overall, if you have never read the LOTR trilogy (or &quot;Hobbit&quot;) then this is definitely the book to pick up. It won't clue you in on every exquisite detail, but it will get rid of much of your confusion.	2002-02-03

Though this is not my favorite of her standalones, it's nevertheless an entertaining fantasy read.<br />Sirius is the Dog Star, a luminary celestial being -- and a pretty powerful one at that. But when he is falsely accused of murder with a Zoi -- an object of power, he is banished to Earth in the form of a dog. A real dog, canine, woof woof. He's horrified, and for a while we follow his transition from a barely-aware pup to an adult dog who is starting to remember his true identity -- and his mission. He was adopted early in his dog's life by a girl named Kathleen -- he is her only friend, as her mother ran away her father is imprisoned in Ireland, and the people around her treat her with scorn for being Irish. \\"Duffie\\" in particular is nasty, forcing Kathleen to do all the housework and repeatedly threatening to have Sirius put down.<br />Then his real life behins to catch up with him. He meets the Sun luminary, Sol, and encounters such creatures as his ex-Companion -- whom, he remembers, helped set him up. There is also the sinister, icy-cold dog Yeff and his strange Master, where threads of Celtic mythology are woven into the storyline. With his human friends, dog and cat friends, and the assistance of the Sun and Earth, Sirius tries to find the Zoi and save not only himself, but perhaps even the world.<br />I expected a great deal more from this book than I got. Perhaps it's because the idea of stars in semi-humanoid form is so very rich in potential, but often the story veered dangerously close to a straightforward anthropomorphic fantasy. You have no idea how relieved I was when Sirius encountered Sol and was reminded of his former status.<br />Wynne-Jones's writing is impeccable yet again, and her descriptions of a dog viewpoint were pretty good, in my limited experience (having never been a dog). I enjoyed such interactions as the ones between the dogs and cats (such as Sirius's rescue of Tibbles) and between dogs and humans, as Sirius finds that not all humans dislike him and becomes loyally steadfast to Kathleen and to the quirky old Miss Smith.<br />Kathleen is a fairly straightforward Cinderella heroine -- only the scene where she smashes pottery and where she is bullied for being Irish really stand out. Basil and Robin, her cousins, are slightly darker horses in that you sometimes don't know whether to like or dislike them. Miss Smith is delightful, as is the poisonously polite, extremely steadfast Sol. There is also the quiet, gentle Earth; Patches the idiotic dog; Tibbles and the other two cats; the despicable Duffie; and the cold, shrill, even more despicable Companion.<br />This is a fairly straightforward story, and though I was somewhat bored by the first two thirds, the last third speeds up and becomes truly intriguing and amazing.

I'd never read it before, and initially I was turned off by the unicorn illustration on the cover. But I'd heard lots of comments about how magical it was, and so I sat down to read.<br />Newly orphaned Maria Merryweather is being sent from London to Moonacre Manor, the castle-like home of her uncle, Benjamin Merryweather. Initially Maria and her devoted governess Miss Heliotrope expect the place to be cold and uncomfortable -- but Maria is delighted to see an enchanted, silvery landscape, and the brief vision of a white horse running past. She fits quickly into the slightly strange, almost idyllic surroundings -- despite the fact that no woman has come to Moonacre Manor in twenty years. But Sir Benjamin seems very pleasant -- as does the huge, unusual dog Wrolf.<br />Maria is enchanted both by the beautiful natural surroundings and the neighboring village of Silverydew. But she begins to sense that something is wrong: her uncle is unhappy about something and won't talk about the briefly-seen white horse. Her childhood invisible friend Robin returns to her -- and the inhabitants of Silverydew know him. Beautiful items are laid out in her tiny, luxurious room -- with the initials L.M. And strange dark figures are creeping through the woods near the sea. Maria soon finds out about a long-lasting story of magic, sadness, greed and darkness that has haunted her family for generations, and is determined to set it right.<br />Goudge was evidently one of the few authors who can effectively blur the line between reality and dreaminess. Some sections of her prose are almost intoxicating; she never held back from describing surroundings and items lushly. The dreamy atmosphere of the book is established when Maria and Miss Heliotrope (and Wiggins the dog) arrive at Moonacre. Such beautifully written passages crop up, such as \\"moonlight and firelight mingled their silver and gold.\\"<br />We also are given examples of Ms. Goudge's evident love of both nature, the countryside, and religion (not preachily, simply a demonstration of the beauties she saw in it). She also mixes in a few other items: the hare being a \\"Fairy\\" creature, the legend behind the Merryweathers and the valley, the sinister Black Men in the forest, and the enchanting visualization of the \\"little white horse\\" being one of the white horses that crashes in on sea foam.<br />Some aspects of this book are a little unusual by current politically correct standards: we get several negative references to \\"female curiosity\\", atheists may be offended by Ms. Goudge's evident dislike of atheism. And I literally have no idea what a \\"syllabub\\" is. However, since this takes place in a past era, there's no reason to fuss about it.<br />Maria herself is a delightful heroine, with just enough quirks to make her realistic -- her mild preoccupation with clothes, for example. Miss Heliotrope is not the usual strict spinster governess, but a kind and upright woman with real emotions and feelings. Wiggins is a little pain in the tail. We also have the fascinatingly charismatic Parson, who manages to make religion come dazzlingly alive while also being kind and gentle. And we have the loquacious Marmaduke Scarlet, a dwarf cook with an odd temper, an amazing culinary craft, and a vaguely gnome-like appearance. And it takes a little while for Robin to develop beyond the level of \\"boyish sprite,\\" but he's a nice character as well.<br />This is a thoroughly delightful book, full of childlike innocence and wonder that very few could pull off. Fans of Narnia and the \\"Hobbit\\" will probably eat this right up. A timeless, charming tale.their silver and gold.\\" <br />We also are given examples of Ms. Goudge's evident love of both nature, the countryside, and religion (not preachily, simply a demonstration of the beauties she saw in it).

Thankfully Diana Wynne-Jones recognized this, and as a result \\"Tale of Time City\\" is shot through with her delightfully otherworldly, wry sense of humor.<br />It's 1939, and Vivian Smith is heading to the country to stay with her Cousin Marty, while London is being bombed. But as Vivian steps off at the train station, a strange boy moves off and drags her into another world. His name is Jonathan Lee and his younger cousin Sam is helping him. They think that she is the extremely important Time Lady, who is the only one who can wake Time City's founder: Faber John.<br />Time City, where Jonathan and Sam live, is a futuristic civilization existing outside of time, and observing it closely. And grabbing a person from an unstable era such as \\"Twenty Century\\" is a serious offense -- both for them and for Vivian. They hastily disguise her as their cousin Vivian, who is currently living with her parents in Twenty Century as observers, and claim that their aunt and uncle sent Vivian to live back in Time City. Jonathan's family welcomes Vivian with open arms, but she still has to get used to a strange world filled with invisible furniture, androids -- and a future timeline for Earth that boggles the mind.<br />But Time City itself is in danger. The timekeeping \\"polarities\\" are being stolen, and the Faber John's stone (that will supposedly crumble as Time City crumbles) is cracking and crumbling. No one knows what to do -- but Vivian, Jonathon and Sam are determined to find out. Who is stealing the polarities? Who is affecting time? Where are Faber John and the Time Lady -- and how can they help?<br />\\"Tale\\" is a complex book. Perhaps too much so, because though I don't confuse easily, I had a little trouble keeping track of the meanings of various words, the time periods, and some of the secondary characters. It may be one of those books that is impossible to soak in fully at one reading, so I suggest that readers read it more than once.<br />Wynne-Jones's sense of humor is still present here; she doesn't overdo Vivian's surprise at her futuristic surroundings, but does a realistic job of portraying the desperation a person in her place would be feeling. We also have little nods and winks -- wait for the section where we find out what happened to \\"Leon.\\" Sempitern Walker is a hilarious character; Elio, the android, is also fun as he experiences things like pain and anger for the first time, as well as the scene where he runs around screaming \\"SHOOT ME!\\"<br />If you're hoping for this book to provide lots of time-hopping to exotic locales rather than a central plot, however, you will not like this. Most of the book is concerned with Time City itself -- but don't worry, it's more than interesting enough to keep interest! One interesting detail is that though Time City itself appears rather science-fictiony, the elements in it such as the \\"time egg\\" and the Caskets are pure fantasy and quite enjoyable for a fan of either genre. Twists and complications occur that the reader can't predict or expect, so expect to be stunned and say \\"Of course!\\" more than a few times.<br />Characterizations are great: Vivian is perfect as a young girl snatched from her worrisome but ordinary life; Jonathan is also great, with just enough personality flaws to make him realistic; Sam is a nice sidekick, though his obsession with butter-pies becomes annoying after a while.

A suit-wearing, veddy-veddy English magician with style and a forceful personality, rather than the usual Gandalf-clones. But rather than focusing on a group of people or an individual that Chrestomanci helps, this book focuses on Chrestomanci's life -- more specifically, the events that molded him into the powerful magician ahead.<br />Christopher Chant is essentially a semi-normal little boy in Victorian England &#8212; the abnormal things are discounted, such as meeting mermaids -- or dreaming of places, and coming back with souvenirs. His parents are almost nebulous figures, and his nursemaids change continuously. One day he meets his Uncle Ralph, a friendlier person than any Christopher has encountered before.<br />It turns out that Christopher is a \\"spirit traveller\\" -- when he dreams, he actually drifts from one world into another. To add to this oddity, he also has nine lives (he uses up a few of them as the story progresses). And not only Uncle Ralph is interested in Christopher's talents &#8212; his father manages to get him to Chrestomanci Castle, to be trained as the next Chrestomanci (the person in charge of all magic).<br />And Christopher hears something more &#8212; about smugglers getting illegal magical goods from the different worlds. And Uncle Ralph may be connected to them. Who is good and who is bad? Christopher, the Goddess, and Thogmorten the cat try to save themselves from the sinister smugglers and the guards of another world...<br />One endearing thing about this book is the way that Diana Wynne-Jones understands a small child's way of thinking, such as Christopher assuming that if his mother wants him in a good profession, she wants him to be a missionary. We see Christopher gradually shifting into a more world-aware viewpoint as his powers grow. Wynne-Jones also acknowledges, as many books such as Harry Potter do not, that simply because a place is harder to live in and not as much fun as elsewhere, does not mean that it is a bad place. The people who expect the most from Christopher also care the most. Lessons about responsibility, using your natural-born gifts, and caring about others are also sprinkled throughout it.<br />Christopher is a very realistic protagonist. He's not perfect, and simply because he is powerful people don't revere him as being better than anyone else. One of the best scenes in the book involves a friend of his scolding him for being self-absorbed and cold to others &#8212; and Christopher realizes with a shock that it's true. The Goddess, a very bored incarnation-of-a-deity from another world, is an excellent female lead and counterpoint to Christopher. (The scene where they debate who is a heathen is hilarious). Most of the other characters flit in and out too quickly and briefly for us to form a solid opinion of them, but Throgmorten (\\"Wong!\\") is also a priceless personality.<br />Writing style is nearly impeccable, very evocative and only goes dead in a few areas. There is also a lot of humor in this book: the scene where Christopher runs wailing through the hospital, Throgmorten the \\"wong!\\" cat, Christopher's obsession with being a missionary, and other tidbits of hilarity.<br />This is a wonderful fantasy book, especially if you're already a fan of the Chrestomanci books.

But other developments crop up as well -- interviews with famous personages, the affair of Lancelot with Queen Guinevere, and more.<br />We follow Lienors, Dalyn, and other characters such as Ygraine la Grande (whose hair is \\"revolting\\" due to hair dye from Nimue) and Lord Horny (don't ask). We also have old favorites like Queen Guinevere, Morgan-Morgause (one person in this book), Sir Lancelot, the somewhat chattery Sir Galahad, the somewhat angry Elayne (you can tell that in this one, Galahad got his personality from his dad), and Merlin of course. (Addressed occasionally as \\"Mr. Merlin\\" -- this particularly interpretation of the old wizard is delightful)<br />Mitchison's writing is very clear and evocative; dialogue is very enjoyable, often lapsing into a \\"veddy veddy English\\" manner of speaking (Galahad is the most prominent of these). The usage of such terms as \\"O.K.\\" never detracts from the dialogue, which is less pompous and self-conscious than many Arthurian books. These characters are willing to lampoon bishops, talk about hair dye, and discuss teen girl crushes on Lancelot.<br />Like all the GKP books I've read, this book has a lovely cover, and a very good binding and fine quality paper. It's shorter than most of the books by this publisher (219 pages) though significantly longer than many successful spoofs that I've read. And perhaps \\"spoof\\" is the wrong word for it &#8212; satire is infinitely better. There's a wry, sideways feel to this story, with some serious scenes and some that are outright hilarious. (It's not really suitable for kids, due to some mild subject matter connected with the original stories -- as well as one mildly dirty scene in Spiral Castle -- but is fine for teens)<br />This is a must-read for any Arthuriana fan, especially those who enjoy seeing sacred cows barbecued. And it will insure that you will never again read the stories about King Arthur and his knights without imagining Lienors and her dwarf in the background.dirty scene in Spiral Castle -- but is fine for teens)<br />This is a must-read for any Arthuriana fan, especially those who enjoy seeing sacred cows barbecued.

Wrong, in this case it's Candlewick Lamplighter, the \\"Rover,\\" written by popular media-tie-in writer Mel Odom.<br />Wick Lamplighter is a dweller, one of a race of pint-sized timid unadventurous folk, and a Third Librarion in the Great Library, the Vault of All Knowledge (essentially a giant repository for all the stories and knowledge). Though he fantasizes about adventures and derring-do (unusual for a dweller, and regarded as weird and dangerous), Wick is actually very timid and easily frightened.<br /><br />All that has to change when he is attacked by vicious undead Boneblights, and inadvertantly gets picked up by a band of pirates on the One-Eyed Peggie. Though they initially view him as bad luck, he becomes a valued member of the crew - only to be taken by goblin traders to Hanged Elf's Point, and then into a very strange, twisty situation with a band of thieves and a mercenary elf queen...<br /><br />I was prepared to really hate this book, after seeing the cover art where a pair of apparently barefoot halflings meet a guy in full Robin Hood gear. Having recently suffered through alternate interpretations of hobbits and \\"wee\\" folk, I assumed that this book was essentially a ripoff of the Hobbit. There are some notable similarities, but somehow they didn't grate on me. Partly because the circumstances and internal journeys of Wick and Bilbo are immensely dissimilar - Wick has no one watching after him, no band of dwarves to lean on, and no choice at all in whether he goes or not. The dwarves and elves are fairly generic, as are humans Brant and Sonne who are toughie heart-of-gold thieves. I was glad that the pirates weren't 2-D baddies, but a tight-knit group with their own code of ethics and a never-leave-a-man-behind mentality. His original creatures like Embyrs and Boneblights are very cool. And his wizards range from the wise scrying-bowl types to the sword-wielding Purple Cloaks.<br /><br />He also provides a backstory concerning the \\"Cataclysm\\", the evil Lord Kharrion (say it out loud), and Kharrion's evil creatures that leaves the reader wanting more. Character development is also quite different. Wick essentially must deal with his deep-rooted timidity and the acknowledgement that the sort of adventures he loves can be much messier than he expected. Such moments as going into the wizards' tombs or dealing with the fiery, degenerated Embyr are well-done, as is the confrontation with the dragon, which hits at all of Wick's weak spots. (\\"I make beautiful Qs!\\")<br /><br />Problems? Occasionally the world of the Rover lapses into a mildly Middle-Earthish feel (such as certain kinds of Elves being gone). Occasionally statements by Wick sound a little too hobbitish, as does the treatment of \\"halfers\\"; and the humor sometimes feels a little strained. A couple of the cover quotes strike me as a little strange -- and anyone who thinks that Wick surpasses Tolkien Frodo and Bilbo has a screw loose. In addition, there are about a million loose ends at the end, though this appears to be deliberate. If Mr. Odom writes a sequel -- or even a prequel -- in this universe, I will read with pleasure.<br /><br />(My remaining questions are -- who is the other halfer with Wick on the cover, why isn't that scene in the book, and why are Wick's hands dramatically different sizes?)cool.

What I found was a delightful fantasy story, with some intelligent lessons to teach (lightly, not heavy-handedly), a brave and realistic heroine, a band of fun sidekicks, heavy Celtic influence and a dash of Arthurian presence.<br />Meryl is a mabinog (bard-in-training) who is currently being punished for what she sees as a minor transgression: taking a peek into the book of Taliesin, the first bard. Now she lives with an old woman away from the hall where the Bards live, unable to study or interact with the others. Frustrated by her punishment and still grieving for her mother, Meryl decides that she will become a bard by going on a quest, to the mystical isle of Avalon. (There is also supposed to be a magical cauldron -- if you drink from it, you either go mad or become a great bard)<br />But she rapidly finds that it's not as easy as she assumed. After a humiliating experience in a village, she meets a grumpy draoi (think a very tiny &quot;ent&quot;) named Halstatt, who blames the ancient bard Taliesin for taking his magical rose. And when she and Halstatt venture onto a Twlwyth Teg (fairy) Way -- Meryl wearing an iron brooch -- they are in serious trouble, ordered by the King to go to Avalon and either be punished or rewarded, as the Queen says. He sends a flighty little Twlwyth Teg, Leaflighter, along with them just in case.<br />But when one of Leaflighter's jokes goes wrong, they end up delayed with a healer-woman, whose son is a trained king's fool. Heini comes along as well, as the troubles of the little band grow worse -- and Meryl must learn what it truly is to be a bard.<br />It's kind of surprising that this delightful fantasy wasn't snapped up by a larger publisher. This story is somewhat reminiscent of Lloyd Alexander's Prydain Chronicles, with the easy-to-comprehend Celtic mythos (much of it real legend -- something I noticed and enjoyed greatly) and the band of mildly idiosyncratic characters on a journey. The writing is also somewhat similar to Alexander's, though less of it is devoted to dialogue than to very evocative descriptions. The scenes in Avalon fairly chime with magic and beauty, without losing the real edge of the rest of the book. There's also a good dollop of humor: Leaflighter less so than you'd imagine, in favor of Halstatt's blunt observations about humans (and Meryl in particular). And the scene where they &quot;transform&quot; as a practical joke is pretty hilarious.<br />However, like all good fantasy, we have a few lessons sprinkled throughout it -- the cauldron of Ceridwen is one. Another is the judge's conversation with Meryl about Taliesin: That if he did take Halstatt's rose, &quot;Would that make his achievements less great, or his ideals less worthy?&quot; The adjustment of ideals is skilfully written. As is the poetry -- many authors stink at writing poetry within the confines of a novel, but Mullin does it very well. Kasia Charko's illustrations are soft and slightly flowing, but never unrealistic-looking.<br />In short, this is a delightful fantasy book for all ages. Highly recommended to fans of the Prydain Chronicles, with a dash of Tamora Pierce and T.A. Barron.I noticed and enjoyed greatly) and the band of mildly idiosyncratic characters on a journey.

Fans of Tamora Pierce may find something very much to their liking here.<br />The story opens with the spirited young princess Torina of Archeld, a beautiful and strong kingdom -- of which she is the only heir, when she marries. Her father has just conquered the peaceful kingdom of Bellandra and brings her back two gifts: a tiny crystal globe and the captured Bellandran prince. Torina frees the prince, Landen, who is allowed to learn how to fight along with the young soldiers-in-training, who see him as a weakling.<br />Torina soon discovers that she can see glimpses of the future in the little ball, and befriends Landen after she saves his life. A few years pass, and Torina is betrothed to Vesputo, a cold and ruthless soldier who pretends to be kind and loving around her. But Landen knows that Vesputo only want to marry Torina for her crown, that he really cares nothing for her. But Landen has to leave when he is suspected of rebelling against the king -- and then the king is murdered. Landen changes his name and becomes a respected soldier -- and waits to move against Vesputo.<br />Torina, the only witness to her father's murder, is blackmailed into agreeing to a marriage with Vesputo, and to using her crystal to show him the future. Using her wits and skill, she escapes and hides away in the countryside of a neighboring land. But when a King-Arthur-like high king gives her the chance to defeat Vesputo, she takes it. And in Archeld, Landen and a friend move in to find the famed Sword that supposedly will allow him to defeat any enemy...<br />This is, despite the terrible plot description on the jacket flap, a very intense and multilayered novel. Hanley, unlike many authors, manages to evolve the characters' personalities throughout the book: Torina goes from naive, emotional and trusting to more mature, guarded and thoughtful; Landen transforms from an embittered teen to one who is more forgiving and merciful.<br />Fans of Tamora Pierce and Robin McKinley will probably like the generic medieval setting, without the cultural influences of reality, along with the tough heroine and the dashes of magic. Fans of Patricia McKillip may also enjoy the subtle musings on revenge. But it's the clashes between kingdoms and characters that really sell the plot, paralleling the maturation of the heroes, and finally them both springing into action.<br />The only real flaw? Well, sometimes the writing is too brief and undescriptive in important scenes. I actually missed one of them and had to skim back. The climax is breathtakingly written, however, and the dual concepts of the seer (one every generation, for all the lands) and the sword (which is actually a rather small part of it). In addition, some peripheral characters are neglected, and some questions left unanswered.<br />However, the overall result is a tight and well-written, well-plotted and well-characterized fantasy/adventure/romance. Though Torina and Landen spend a great deal of the book away from each other, you know that they've fallen for each other. Another theme that is dealt with but not beaten to death is gender roles and the ability of anyone to help protect their land, by whatever means they can.<br />As far as objectionable material: there's mild profanity used in this book, no dirty content, but there are a large number of murders, a few near misses, and very blunt threats toward Torina's mother. Given the political content (which will bore younger readers), the deaths and the emotional intensity of the characters losing friends and family, this book probably isn't for the younger fantasy reader, but will be fine for twelve and up.<br />Fans of McKinley or Pierce will definitely enjoy this story.

This is probably my least favorite of her books, but that is still several notches above the average fantasy.<br />The protagonist, Sybel, is the daughter, granddaughter and great-granddaughter of powerful wizards, living in an isolated house on a mountain with an array of magical animals. Among them are an ancient dragon Gyld, riddling Boar Cyrin, the deadly Ter Falcon, and others. With telepathic links to her beasts, she has no need for human beings outside the walls of her home. But the animal she still longs to find is the Liralen, a legendary white bird.<br />She is temporarily distracted from her quest when a nobleman, Coren, arrives with a baby, and asks her to care for it. Sybel learns how to love the child, Tamlorn, and for several years they are happy (with the help of an old lady). She also summons a strange smoky creature called Blammor, which terrifies many people -- but hardly affects the calm, icy Sybel.<br />Coren returns and is attacked by Gyld, then brought into Sybel's house by Tam. She is angered when she finds that Coren is there to bring Tamlorn back to the world of men, where his father is a powerful and cold-hearted king named Drede. As time goes by, Sybel sees that Tam wants to see his father. She eventually relents and sends him to his father's home, with Ter Falcon to watch over him. Drede offers to let her come and stay near Tam, but she knows that he would only seek to use her wizardry against his enemies.<br />A dangerous wizard comes hunting for Sybel at Drede's bidding, and tries to seduce her -- before being killed by the Blammor. Sybel is furious and wants revenge on Drede -- but what will she do to gain revenge, and what would the cost of revenge be?<br />I sometimes wonder if Sybel was an experiment for Patricia McKillip, to see if she could write the ultimate &quot;Ice Queen&quot; and still make her sympathetic. I found Sybel less sympathetic than understandable, in that her lack of unnecessary emotion makes her clear-sighted in some situations, while simultaneously making her more susceptible to hatred. She is not really an admirable character in some respects -- we see her engaging in casual theft, using people like pawns, and coldly threatening to set deadly animals on Coren, but at the same time we see her love for Tamlorn and her struggling emotions for Coren.<br />Like so many of Patricia McKillip's books, the plot is deceptively simple with nuances woven through it. McKillip's thoughts on revenge are intertwined with the &quot;Riddle-Master&quot; trilogy, &quot;Fool's Run,&quot; and &quot;Song for the Basilisk.&quot; Here we see how hatred and its offspring, vengeance, might destroy a person from the inside out and destroy what they most care for.<br />The writing is not as lush and luxurious as in many of her other books, nor is the magic in it as take-your-breath-away as that of the Riddle-Master trilogy. We don't get inside Sybel's head very often. Nor is the attraction between Coren and Sybel quite as well-defined as some of her other romances. Coren himself is a wonderful male lead: handsome, brave, compassionate, forgiving, good-natured and with a tragic streak to make him more real. Tamlorn is an excellent portrayal of an innocent, sweet-natured boy raised in a semi-idyllic enviroment, but who craves something of the outside world.<br />This is an excellent YA fantasy, but which is not childish in any way.

When a strange red knight comes by and offers Piers a road out, he eagerly comes along... only to have red knight is quickly killed off by a strange, naive young man named Parsifal, who is hoping to become a knight.<br /><br />The problem is, Parsifal knows absolutely nothing about knighthood -- or manners, for that matter. He brings along the very confused and embarrassed Piers on his quest to learn manners, fighting (from a mystery woodsman who will be quite familiar to readers of this series), and chivalry (after a disastrous dinner with a noble lady).  But disaster strikes when the two stay at a strange, magical castle -- and Parsifal fails to ask \\"the question.\\"<br /><br />I'll be the first to say: This book is not as funny as Morris' prior work. Oh, there's humor, like the catastrophic dinner with the noble lady, Parsifal sending every defeated foe to a woman Sir Kay insulted, Piers's bizarre and oft-noticed hat, the attack on the castle of an overly-romantic maiden, and so forth.<br /><br />But Morris seems to have stretched his boundaries by exploring some more serious, sober territory n the Arthurian legends, such as Parsifal's self-imposed exile. And while Morris' prose still chugs along at a solid, earnest rate, he events leading up to the return to the castle, and what occurs inside is written with a beauty of words that Morris has not displayed in his prior books. But don't worry, it's not too bleak -- Morris' fondness for his characters is evident everywhere, especially since he revisits the Otherworld and some old friends.<br /><br />Piers is a likeable little guy -- he's pretentious and extremely self-conscious at first, but slowly the layers are stripped away until we see Piers as he is really. Parsifal's evolution from naive and sheltered to sad and haunted to secure and newly mature is painful, but worth the journey. He's absent for a good chunk of the book, allowing us to visit old friends Terence and Gawain.

Rich in mythology and haunting magic, these stories are a must-read for fantasy fans, especially those seeking something different than the usual sword-and-sorcery fare.<br />The story picks up not long after the events of &quot;Weirdstone of Brisingamen,&quot; with Colin and Susan encountering magical creatures yet again. While walking in the woods, they encounter an elf named Atlendor and a dwarf called Uthecar, near where Cadellin the wizard guards the sleeping knights. (For a better explanation, read the first book) The lios-alfar (elves) are migrating to Alderly, because a mysterious force is causing some of them to vanish, and Atlendor the elf king is bringing his people together to gather what magic he can. Unfortunately, proximity to the ugly constructions of humans is causing the &quot;smoke sickness&quot; in the elves, and Uthecar asks that Susan lend him the bracelet that Angharad Goldenhand gave her.<br />But Susan is suddenly kidnapped by an evil force, and reappears quiet and strange. She has been taken over by the evil Brollachan, and the dwarves and Cadellin are able to help Colin restore her to normality -- though she will never be quite the same. Unfortunately, evil is still stirring in the form of the Morrigan and her sinister cohorts. And when Susan and Colin light a fire to keep warm on a hill, they inadvertantly set off the band of magical horsemen, the Wild Hunt...<br />There is no lag in quality in &quot;Moon of Gomrath,&quot; and perhaps the biggest flaw is that to understand anything at all, you need to read the first book. Such things as the lios-alfar, Cadellin and his knights, Angharad Goldenhand and the bracelet, and the kids' relationship with all of the above.<br />This is not a retread of the first book, either. Instead of the hideous svart-alfar (goblins), this time we focus on the beautiful lios-alfar. These &quot;elves of light&quot; are as entrancing as Tolkien's elves, though significantly shorter and slighter. The descriptions of their smoke-sickness is heartrending, as their &quot;changing&quot; from what we think of as life is saddening. Cadellin and the dwarves are featured less prominently than in &quot;Weirdstone,&quot; though we do have the evil Pelis the False adding a little spice to the dwarves as a whole. Other creatures are added, such as the bizarre bodachs and the savage palugs.<br />The elves are not the only sad things about this book, and that give it the feeling of a book for older kids. We are told that if someone wears Angharad Goldenhand's bracelet it &quot;leads her ever further from human life,&quot; and that someone who uses a certain object &quot;may not know peace again, not in the sun's circle or in the darkling of the world.&quot;<br />The writing is still quite formal, but evocative of the landscapes and the various unusual creatures present in it. Garner is among the most talented of the minimalist fantasy writers, and he never overburdens the reader with too much information. Colin and Susan are the same excellent characters, but in a sense they, too, are older as they seem to be growing into individual personalities. That doesn't stop them from inadvertantly causing a lot of trouble. The Morrigan is hideous and malevolent, needless to say, and Cadellin is the same wise and thoughtful wizard as in the previous book.<br />Perhaps the worst thing is that there is no third Alderly tale to look forward to.

At first glance, this guide to the new &quot;Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; seems like an excellent source of info and photographs from the movie.<br />The problem is that virtually all of the text is lifted, diluted, and transplanted from the Brian Sibley adult movie guide. This one, on the flip side, has less information than the adult one, as well as far fewer pictures; most of what it does have is in black-and-white, newspaper-quality pictures. There are admittedly some pix that are not included in the adult guide, such as a picture of the Nazgul as they really are, and a picture of Sam wading out to Frodo's boat. But these are simply not worth it.<br />If you do buy a copy, check the cover, which seems to bend and tear easily; also the binding and paper seem very cheap and flimsy. There is a section of color photos in the middle, but not all of them are new.<br />I'm not sure why quality was skimped on for the children's edition -- the adult one has high-quality paper and binding, and every photo is color. Was it thought that kids wouldn't notice? On the contrary -- I found it very frustrating to see less information, and worse quality books.<br />If you wish to buy a movie guide, either buy the more expensive (but worth it) adult edition of this book, or the Fellowship Visual Companion.	2002-01-03

Not quite the same as the adult ones, which have more complete info about places and people, but if your kid has never read LOTR and needs some basic info, this is the right book.<br />It has an excellent array of photos, of such characters as Legolas, the hobbits, the Uruk-Hai, Aragorn, as well as pictures of places: Bag End, Bilbo's birthday party, the tower of Orthanc, Lothlorien, Moria, and so forth. Some of the photos are unsatisfying -- we see only snippets of Rivendell, for example. Some of the pictures are so widely circulated that I wasn't interested, like Gimli kneeling at his cousin's grace, Arwen glancing at the camera, and the I've-seen-it-so-many-times-I'm-sick-of-it photo of Frodo staring at Sting, the sword given to him by Bilbo Baggins.<br />But there are photos not generally shown, like the picture of the four hobbits solemnly holding their swords, blades pointing down; Legolas holding his quiver, and a great still of Aragorn attacking the Nazgul on Weathertop. One slight disappointment is that the many amazing CGI effects (with the exception of shrinking John Rhys-Davies and the hobbit actors) go completely untouched. But perhaps they did not translate well to photo stills, or they didn't want to spoil the effect.<br />Often there are movie quotes (many of them taken out of the final cut) are near the photos, either quotes from the characters themselves, or relating to them. The text itself seemed a little dumbed-down, but as this appears to be a kids' book for new watchers, perhaps that isn't such a bad thing. It gives the basics on the characters' physical traits, brief biographical info (like Sam being the youngest son of the Gaffer) and their relationships with the other Fellowship members.<br />Spoilers are not given away. Major plot developments are hinted at but never stated; in addition, there are no spoilers for the finale, after they leave Lorien.

Wrong, it's Alan Garner's &quot;Weirdstone of Brisingamen,&quot; a spellbinding story in the true tradition of imaginative and inventive fantasy. Garner isn't as well-known as he deserves, but fantasy fans will gobble this right up.<br />Colin and Susan, a pair of English schoolkids, are sent to Alderly for a six-month vacation with their mother's old nurse and her husband. Things start off normally enough, with the kids exploring the area and the myths, legends and superstitions surrounding it. But things begin to take an eerie turn when they encounter a spell-chanting old woman named Selina Place - and then a horde of svart-alfar, hideous and hostile goblins.<br />They are unexpectedly rescued by the wizard Cadellin, who is the keeper of a company of knights sleeping deep under Alderly. They will awaken at some time in the future, to combat the evil spirit Nastrond and his minions in the final, magical battle. There's just one problem: long ago, Cadellin lost the Weirdstone of Brisingamen, the magical jewel that bound the knights there in the first place. Susan realizes too late that the little misty teardrop gem in her bracelet is the Weirdstone - and it's been stolen. The kids team up with Cadellin, the dwarves Fenodyree and Durathror, the lios-alfar (elves), and their friend Gowther to find the Weirdstone - and save the world.<br />Written in the 1960s, this book effectively combines the English-schoolkids-swept-into-magical adventure subgenre with mythology and the overlap of our world with another. Garner's wizards, dwarves, elves and goblins are as legit as Tolkien's, as Garner draws heavily from mythos and legends. There are similarities to Tolkien's creations, but they are sufficiently different that not once do you feel the need to compare. Garner lifts from Norse and Celtic mythologies for this book (mentions of the Morrigan and Ragnarok are featured within pages of one another) and manages to cobble it together into a coherent and believable whole.<br />Alderly is effectively shown - from the moment the kids venture out of the farm, you get the sense that enchantment is thrumming through the land, and that a magical creature could be lurking nearby. The sense of atmosphere is somewhat stunted by the fact that we rarely hear the characters' thoughts, though, but such creatures as the svart-alfar and the lios-alfar are effective in the simple, evocative descriptions.<br />This is a book more for Tolkien fans than Diana Wynne-Jones fans. Though there are a few funny parts, it is overall a relentlessly serious book, with many of the characters using archaic-sounding language. Another good thing: the kids speak like twentieth-century preteens (&quot;That WOULD have made a mess of things!&quot;) while such characters as Durathror speaking like warriors from centuries ago (&quot;... for there I think it will be, and so to Fundindelve, where I shall join you if I may.&quot;) In addition, there is no cutesy magic or gimmickry, or casual magical elements popping up every page or two. The magic featured in here is deadly serious and very intense.<br />Colin and Susan are the archetypical kids-on-holiday-in-magical-place: brave, respectful, inquisitive, curious, and in completely over their heads. Cadellin is an excellent wizard, dignified and powerful but sufficiently human to be sympathetic, such as his reaction when he hears that the Weirdstone has been stolen from Susan. This guy deserves a seat right below Gandalf, and alongside Merlin, Ged and Ebenezum. The dwarves are serious and unusually cool-headed for the fantasy portrayal of dwarves; the lios-alfar are featured less prominently, but the &quot;elves of light&quot; passage is one of the most moving paragraphs in the book, both sad and beautiful.<br />The only problem with this book is its shortness, and its presence as only one of two. The tales of Alderly are so rich that you feel that Garner could have churnedout fifty books and never grown stale. If you are a fan of serious fantasy, for any age, read this book, and the sequel &quot;Moon of Gomrath.&quot;out fifty books and never grown stale.

Tolkien is the man who made the fantasy genre what it is today, so if you're gonna make an anthology honoring him, it better be GOOD.  And for the most part, \\"After the King\\" succeeds wildly at that -- it has stories from some of the greats of fantasy/SF literature, with only a couple duds here and there.<br /><br />Among the best are stories by Patricia McKillip, Charles de Lint, Peter S. Beagle, Andre Norton, Jane Yolen, Emma Bull and Terry Pratchett -- they spin out stories that are poetic and spellbinding, funny and haunting, evocative and magical.  Their stories honor Tolkien by making brilliant use of language and fantastical worlds.<br /><br />There are also some lesser but still wonderful stories by Harry Turtledove, Elizabeth Ann Scarborough, Karen Haber, Poul and Karen Anderson, Robert Silverberg and Judith Tarr. While not as gloriously memorable as the best stories, they are still really good stories, ranging from a delightfully cute story about a wizard with a new assistant to a rather uncomfortable SF story about the origins of a religion.<br /><br />But despite those stories, there are also some duds -- Stephen R. Donaldson (\\"Reave the Just\\"... or \\"Reave the Supremely Uninteresting\\"), Gregory Benford and Barry N. Malzberg all seem to have totally missed out on the charm, magic and language.<br /><br />The absolute worst: Dennis McKiernan's \\"Halfling House,\\" which is basically devoted to McKiernan's Pysks and ripoff-hobbit Warrows, while also making fun of Tolkien's original hobbits. There's a strange plot about a TARDIS-like inn for tiny magical creatures, and a demonic opium den, and an incoherent ending where SOMETHING happens... it's just a mess.<br /><br />Quick warning: do not buy this collection just because it says that the stories are \\"in honor\\" of Tolkien, because most of these stories bear no resemblance to Tolkien's work. There are some stories that remind you of Tolkien because of the exquisite language and the sense of wonder and mystery, but the settings and stories are very different.<br /><br />Some are contemporary stories; some take place in the generic medieval settings, and some take place in specific medieval settings (complete with Viking names). Some are comedic, some tragic, some a combination of both. Several were thought-provoking and introspective. Some of them are pure fantasy, no fantasy, mildly fantasy-like, or bordering on sci-fi.<br /><br />No, this collection should be read for the all-star lineup of fantasy writers that it includes -- some of these people are giants of the genre, and they know how to pay homage without copying Tolkien's trappings. I just wish that Neil Gaiman was in this.<br /><br />\\"After the King\\" mostly lives up to its name -- we have a huge collection of excellent stories from wonderful authors, marred only by a few unmagical duds.stery, but the settings and stories are very different.<br /><br />Some are contemporary stories; some take place in the generic medieval settings, and some take place in specific medieval settings (complete with Viking names).

My old paperback copy has a quite from Ursula Le Guin, stating that Bellairs &quot;knows what wizardry is all about.&quot; Boy, is she right.<br />The book starts at the home of Prospero, a reclusive, good natured wizard with an obnoxious talking mirror and a lot of very tacky clutter. His friend Roger Bacon arrives at his home, only to find that sinister forces are creeping toward Prospero's home: an enormous moth that gives them a creepy feeling. Gray-cloaked figures lurking outside. A skeletal bird fluttering at the window.<br />Roger brings news about a strange book; Prospero realizes that there is an old enemy, Melichus, gaining power to destroy him. He and Roger set out on a hazardous journey across the geographically simple land, ruled by a rather unimpressive king, to find and unravel the mystery behind this strange growing force for evil.<br />More than once, Prospero and Roger will hit a dead end, be deceived by an evil illusion, or face the horrifying effects of their enemy. And the final battle in this book is unlike any battle of wizards ever seen before.<br />This book is very difficult to summarize, as some things simply don't click into place for a long time. It is, additionally, not a book that you can really skim. I read the book once, said &quot;What?&quot; on the last page, and had to go back and reread the climax.<br />This book lacks, in parts, the humor so necessary in Bellairs's books to keep the protagonists from going insane. Long stretches have nothing funny at all; we do have the irritating, singing magic mirror, the attack of the troll on the mini-boat, and the ridiculous rhyming spells that the wizards often utter: &quot;Trying to find out if/(Hagiographically)/John of Jerusalem/liked almond paste...&quot;<br />This book also defies fantasy cliches; the world that Prospero and Roger live in is very simple, not filled with dark fortresses and castles, but with ordinary villages connected by roads and woods. Evil, in Bellairs's world, is not something that sits on a throne and gives sadistic orders; it creeps into cracks and crevices and flits out at people. The &quot;moth&quot; scene manages to give an ordinary annoyance a feeling of horror; the scene where Prospero finds the innkeeper, and his subsequent escape are some of the most effectively creepy scenes I've ever read. He does so without gore or gimmicks; half the horror is not knowing what is conjured by Melichius.<br />Prospero is a quietly likeable character; his quirky house endears us to him, as does his reaction to the magic mirror. Roger is a little less defined, as the real him appears throughout a relatively small amount of the book. Other characters flit in and out.<br />Wizardry in this book is more than incantations and walking around with a funny hat (which neither of the characters has). I liked the description of the final duel between good and evil; also the effect on a wizard's staff when the wizard dies. Bellairs's wizardry is not flashy or show-offy, but a serious practice.<br />This book is relatively short, only about 180 pages; some kids may be a bit confused by the complexity of it, though.

While not as textured or carefully developed as Sabriel, it is nevertheless engrossing and convincing, and -- yes, indeed, far better than almost every kids-get-sucked-into-fantasy-world-to-battle-evil.<br />We open to see Paul and his sister Julia, playing on a beach where Julia finds a rag doll embedded in enormous black feathers and a bunch of sticks. Though Julia seems thrilled with the doll, Paul immediately gets &quot;bad vibes&quot; from the doll -- and hears a sinister voice calling it the &quot;Ragwitch.&quot; Within minutes, Julia is taken over by the doll, and begins a transformation into an enormous living version of the Ragwitch -- a malevolent creature who surpasses C.S. Lewis' White Witch.<br />The Ragwitch escapes into another world, and Paul follows her. Julia is trapped inside the Ragwitch's mind, constantly hearing the Ragwitch's voice and seeing/hearing what she does. Upon arriving at her destination, the Ragwitch summons her hideous army of unnatural, distorted creatures. They begin to attack the innocent people nearby -- including an old witch who has a strange effect on the Ragwitch. Julia gains unexpected allies locked within her enemy's memory: the witch Lyssa, attacked by the Ragwitch; Mirren, a king that the Ragwitch locked into a shambling animalistic form; and a mysterious red-haired woman who may be the key to helping defeat the evil hordes...<br />Paul refuses to give up on his sister, and learns from a peculiar old hermit that he must gain the help of the wild magic Elementals -- Fire, Water, Earth and Air. The problem is that all four may or may not choose to help him. He must also deal with the rather eccentric Patchwork King, the keeper of all magic...<br />Perhaps the book's biggest flaw is the beginning. While we come to know and like Paul and Julia over the course of the book, we leap straight into the finding of the Ragwitch without knowing much about the characters, their background, their family, etc. An introductory chapter might be nice. And since there was a gap of a few years between the writing of two parts of it, the style of it seems to flow more easily in the second half than the first. The dialogue also is a bit stilted in the beginning, but grows easier as the book progresses.<br />Anyhow, the Ragwitch herself is horrific. My initial reaction was &quot;Raggedy Ann meets the Exorcist&quot;, but frankly after a while I stopped thinking about the idea of a sentient rag doll, and focused on the sadistic evil of her. Yet at the same time, we are given a glimpse of the person that the Ragwitch once was (well, before she got a body of &quot;indestructible cloth&quot;) and how she became the monster that she is. The Elementals are sufficiently different in temperament, from the crabby Water to the kindly Earth to the flamenco-dancing Fire. We don't get to know Paul as well as Julia, since Julia does a great deal of introspection, while sometimes it felt like we were focusing more on what Paul was doing than on Paul himself.<br />This is definitely a YA book, as many sections of it will be horrifying for younger children. Oroch, for example, is a pretty creepy character -- Nix doesn't tell us what he looks like under his bandages, but the implication is enough. We also get a girl possessed by an evil creature, massacres of humans and assorted battles (not graphically shown).<br />Nix also displays a fantasy tactic that he used later in Sabriel, and which he does extremely well: the mix of high fantasy and more modern things, such as the hot-air balloon, and the various foodstuffs that the Patchwork King conjures. This is not an easy thing to do convincingly, but Nix does it in rare style. He also managed to pull off an ending that a lesser author might have fumbled.<br />This book is not as textured as Sabriel or its sequel. But it is nevertheless an effective fantasy witha dash of horror. Well worth the read!a dash of horror. Well worth the read!	2001-12-03

I love the covers -- they're probably the best shots of the characters. The box containing them has a great frozen action moment: Nazgul galloping through a river. FOTR's cover: Frodo, looking very concerned and intense in candlelight. Two Towers: Saruman, clutching his staff and looking suitably sinister. ROTK: Aragorn, looking grim, in woodland surroundings.<br />The quality is pretty good -- it's a little too easy to get finger smudges on the shiny covers, but that's not a major pet peeve. This may also be a good buy for those of who annoyed by the boxed mass market paperback editions, which I am told are of lesser quality.<br />The plot? Well, virtually everyone knows it anyway, so I shall not bother.<br />One can only speculate on the tastes of &quot;reader from Spokane,&quot; but I tend to think that low-grade D&amp;D is about the extend of his attention span. As for Tolkien's reported &quot;spelling changes,&quot; he was a British person in a different era -- not all the spelling will be similar. Ditto with the dialogue. And pardon me -- the whole point of having jolly, chubby &quot;halflings&quot; as heroes is to show that everyone has the capacity for heroism.<br />Additionally, to dismiss it as being overly long and to judge EVERY character on Tom Bombadil is a simplistic judgement that ignores the mind-blowing scope and creativity of Tolkien's world. He created a religious pantheon of angels, an entire history of a world, and the rise and fall of several civilizations -- not to mention breathing life into multiple species like elves and dwarves. But even if you have not read the books on his invented languages or read the Silmarillion (the &quot;Bible&quot; of Middle-Earth), its still a pretty wild ride, complete with orcs, demonic Black Riders, enormous spiders, the beautifully ethereal elf Galadriel, exiled king Aragorn, the ghastly Gollum -- and a pair of friends who must fight against the worst thing in the world: The pure evil Ring that they have to lug with them.<br />LOTR has a lot of valuable lessons, heroes, and stories. One person once speculated that Tolkien also gives us a few lessons on prejudice (Legolas and Gimli, best friends from antagonistic races), friendship (Sam and Frodo), and classes (Sam, the lowly gardener who eventually becomes... no, that's a spoiler!) Whether this is true, it nevertheless has good role models to follow. Some kids trained by TV and movies to have short attention spans will probably complain, but if you can get to the inn at Bree, then it shifts from &quot;The Hobbit&quot;-like lightness into a darker, faster-paced more adult story.<br />A small note: Though Gandalf gives Frodo (and readers) the run-through in FOTR, you probably won't understand the stuff about Bilbo, Gollum and the Ring if you don't read the Hobbit. That book is not included in this boxed set. So I advise you get a nice copy of that, and read it too.<br />And whether you have never read it before, or whether you have in the past: You must read this trilogy before the movies are released.the worst thing in the world: The pure evil Ring that they have to lug with them.<br />LOTR has a lot of valuable lessons, heroes, and stories.

This is not the best fantasy I've read, but a nice read anyway.<br />Abby Clover and the curious Spike are washed ashore after a storm. They soon find that they are in strange new surroundings that include witches, shark-infested seas, captives and missing people, and Ice Dust, which is the cause of magic.<br />They team up with Captain Starlight (huh?) and his albatross Benbow; also Chadwick Street, who is the leader of the Light Witches (why not wizards? I don't know). But as they travel over the shark-y water to the Night Witch fortress, they will have only their wits and a few insufficient talents to defeat a terrible enemy, without the help of the Ice Dust...<br />I liked this book. My breath wasn't sucked away like the best works of fiction do, and while I found it a pleasant pasttime, I wasn't hungering for more once it was finished.<br />Perhaps it was the rather lightweight feel of some aspects of it, such as the names: Starlight, Abby Clover, Chadwick Street -- and Spike only brought to mind the blond vampire. Slightly more exotic or indistinguishable names might be better -- these feel rather cutesy. Also the concept of Light and Night witches (wizards?) is far from new. The Ice Dust brings a feeling rather reminiscent of Philip Pullman's Dust as well (though I far prefer Molloy's book to Pullman's!)<br />The writing is pretty good, fairly descriptive. The characters of Abby and Spike are pretty well-done, as is Benbow the Albatross. I didn't really connect with Starlight, though, and Chadwick Street just annoyed me. I can't say why; perhaps he seemed a little too showy and two-dimensional.<br />Overall, this is a pleasant read, especially for those who prefer British fantasy to American fantasy. It's not deep, but is a pleasant book nevertheless. Simply do not expect something that will take your breath away.pect something that will take your breath away.	2001-11-29

This book is far more original and entertaining, thouhg some parts of it fall a little flat.<br />In the land of Middle Terra Firma (to avoid copyright infringements I imagine *wink*) &quot;only the very wise and very foolish dared travel the black highway [...] that along this highway a mighty dragon called Smof plied its evil trade.&quot; (Opposite page, an enormous eighteen-wheeler with teeth and flames is about to mow down a wizard, Randolf Shortshanks, who &quot;had long since swapped sorcery for saucery&quot;) Smog is driven by the Dark Rider (think a Black Rider with a roadmap) and mows down anything in front of it.<br />But from the Shyer come the Halfwits (ha!) and a team is sent out to save... whatever: A wizard, a dwarf, four Halfwits, an Elf and a Warrior were chosen. &quot;Badly were they equipped, for there was a mighty shortage of useful things like magic cloaks and broken swords...&quot;<br />Footnoted more heavily than a Terry Pratchett book, this book has a lot of wit and cuteness. It's far more effective than the dated, we-wanna-shock-you &quot;Bored of the Ring&quot;. Names like &quot;Borrownomore&quot; and &quot;Halfwits&quot; are hilarious!<br />The problems? Well, some of the pages fall flat; I also was a bit surprised that after several prose-y pages, we get the ending in poetry. And the numerous illustrations are not the best that one could have hoped for. They would have fit better in a humorous children's book -- realistic caricatures would have worked better for this book, like the hilarious cover. It's also quite short.<br />It's hardly flawless. Nevertheless, if you're a Tolkien fan you may want to pick up this cute little book and get some honest laughs.	2001-11-29

Filled with more suspense and intensity than the previous book, this one is a more breathless read, making me think that Sedgwick is only improving.<br />Jamie is traumatized when he fails to save his sister from a destructive house fire. To help the haunted young boy, his parents send him to Crownhill, where he assists in cleaning an ancient carving by a hill. But dreams are haunting him -- not dreams of the fire, but dreams of an ghastly old woman, whom he is pursuing. The worst part is that it is affecting reality -- he wakes with chalk on his feet.<br />Crownhill has a mysterious background -- of strange deaths. And as the carving on the hill is revealed, Jamie finds that the word is not &quot;crown,&quot; but &quot;crone.&quot; Dreams and flashbacks, past and present mesh together to throw Jamie into a spine-tingling adventure. When he has unraveled the truth about a witch trial centuries before, he must confront the ghostly old woman on &quot;Walpurgis Night&quot; -- and the strange truth of what happened to his sister.<br />Sedgwick's story feels earthier and more sinister than &quot;Floodland,&quot; perhaps because this is not a what-if story, but a supernatural one. He also skillfully weaves together the two stories, of the old witch burning and the present one about Jamie.<br />Atmosphere is well-handled, conveying the full creepiness of the old crone and of the discovery about the carving. The climax is breathtaking; the handling of Jamie's trauma is better than the twerpy handling of children's trauma in most books, given the revelation at the end and his present preoccupations. The writing is pretty good, though I felt that sometimes the sentences were a little too choppy.<br />Teens looking for a spooky thriller will enjoy this book -- it might be a little too intense for younger kids, given the subject matter of homes burning, witch burnings in the past, and spectral witches haunting a boy's dreams. I'm looking forward to Sedgwick's next novel.st, and spectral witches haunting a boy's dreams. I'm looking forward to Sedgwick's next novel.	2001-11-29

Yolen also experiments with a unique chapter format, as often chapters are split into &quot;Chapter One; Chapter One - Almost; Chapter One - Sort of&quot; which adds extra charm.<br />Jerrold and Gerund are young boys who live in parallel versions of a huge house, &quot;surrounded by rowan trees that are proof against magic.&quot; With each one lives the beautiful, chilly white cat; with Gerund also lives the overenthusiastic Mully the dog (who tends to echo the last few words of each sentence).<br />Outside, the Wild Hunt has begun; the chaotic, frightening king of winter is on the search for the Lady, who is &quot;She Who Is Ever, She Whose Word Is Law, The Once and Future Queen, Maiden Mother and Crone, Summer and Goodness and Light.&quot; (Those last are highly debateable) Gerund and Jerrold are swept into the snowy wilderness, full of frightening hounds and the Moss-man, and the result of the clash between Summer and Winter is something that they never could have dreamed of.<br />One interesting fact about this book is that since the forces in motion are so much greater than the boys, they are not really able to change much. (I enjoyed the mentions of Aragorn, Ged, and Will Stanton by one of the boys, as fictional heroes) The ending is intriguing -- I really didn't see that coming, but after the events of the climax, I can't imagine it any other way.<br />Jerrold and Gerund are both brave and interesting, yet freaked enough by what is happening for them to be realistic. Mully's antics may grate on readers, but certain plot developments make him poignant rather than irritating. The horned man is menacing and nasty, but intriguing in his showdown with his wife. She's a bit more of a dark horse, as she seems much sweeter and more refined, but at the same time she is very cold and perhaps as menacing as her husband.<br />The writing is lovely, lyrical and very evocative. The pictures are simple black and white, very lifelike while retaining a slight softness and candlelit appearance. As far as quality goes, like some Point books it is printed on thick white paper, with a tight binding. No cracks on the edges of the binding, like many mass market paperbacks!<br />Some parents may not want their younger kids to read this, given the death of a couple characters, the idea of a young boy being used as &quot;bait,&quot; a river of blood, and a forest of fruit that is actually maggots, flies, and insects. Additionally, younger children won't be able to fully appreciate the richness and background of this tale, though they may like it. Short as it is, this strikes me as more a YA novel than a children's.<br />Overall, this is a beautiful tale worthy of many rereadings on a winter's night.br />The writing is lovely, lyrical and very evocative.

In most trilogies, the middle volume is the weak one, tying beginning and end together with too little plot. Patricia McKillip skillfully avoids this pitfall in &quot;Heir of Sea and Fire,&quot; the second slim volume in her Riddlemaster trilogy, and the story of Raederle, the second most beautiful woman in An.<br />A year has passed since Morgan of Hed vanished at Erlenstar Mountain, and suddenly the land-rule passes to Morgan's brother -- a sign that Morgan is dead, that the harpist Deth has betrayed him. As he was the Star-Bearer, assorted people are extremely upset. And a few refuse to believe that it can be true.<br />Raederle's father is one of them; after he leaves, his daughter meets the Morgul of Herun, and her brother in Caithnard. There she teams up with the Morgul's daughter, Lyra (whom Morgan met in &quot;Riddlemaster&quot;) who is angry at Morgan's supposed death, and eager to accompany Raederle wherever she goes. They set off on a ship, going to Erlenstar Mountain, and soon find that aside from Raederle, Lyra, and Lyra's fellow guards, they also have Tristan of Hed stowed away (who is promptly seasick).<br />Raederle finds out that Morgan has recently appeared, kept captive by the mysterious and evil Ghisteslwchlohm, and betrayed by Deth -- who is now on the run from everyone. But as Raederle's questions are answered, more pop up. She encounters a shapechanger, and then runs into Deth camping in the woods. Answers about the High One, about Morgan, and about her own abilities and heritage begin to come to light, as the dead of An begin to blaze back into existance. Raederle must bargain with fate and a dead king, using only her newfound powers and a crowned skull, to save Morgan -- and the rapidly unraveling world.<br />Wow, where to begin? Well, for one thing, Patricia McKillip delivers a wallop in book two of three, explaining many of the things she brought up in &quot;Riddlemaster&quot; and starting the buildup to the huge climax in book three (which I am now twenty pages into). This book (thankfully) does not end on a cliffhanger like &quot;Riddlemaster&quot;; also, if you are looking for an immediate answer to the cliffhanger previously shown, then you will be frustrated enough to give the Great Shout.<br />In addition, we are given another character who is as realistic as Morgan: Raederle, the second-most beautiful woman in An. Her looks are only brought up a couple times, as it's her strength, brains, and search for the truth and for Morgan that catch the reader -- and are most often displayed. The explanation for her growing power and the use she makes of it is as breathtaking as Morgan learning how to become a tree or a vesta. The scenes where she dangles the crowned skull to get that dead king to bargain with her was priceless, and the climax is shattering. McKillip's skill in describing magic grows even further; the descriptions of what Raederle is doing are like poetry. In addition, she does not remain a static character as she learns shattering truths and encounters strange people; she grows more mature and stronger.<br />We don't see Morgan much, though we hear a lot about him, and his sudden growth of power. More we see of Raederle and Lyra, who is fleshed out from the more shadowy character from &quot;Riddlemaster.&quot; It's a rare gift to write strong women convincingly. Deth remains strange and ambiguous -- he betrayed Morgan, yet makes no excuses for himself. Other characters like the Morgul and Morgan's siblings are more absent (though what Tristan does is a bit unforgettable).<br />McKillip's writing is a bit more flowery than in &quot;Riddlemaster,&quot; more descriptive and dreamy in parts. We get a few more puns on &quot;Hel,&quot; such as that the Star-Bearer's path was leading straight into Hel.

Several different interpretations of, for example, Morgan le Fay are covered in her entry, coming from the assorted sources. Gaps in information are usually acknowledged by the author, and she provides the reader with speculation as to origins and meanings.<br />The body of information is mind-bogglingly enormous; I can only speculate how long it took Karr to get it all whipped into a neat, well-written book of only six hundred pages. Her writing is often made lengthy simply by the enormous amount of material to be compressed. In addition, she often says, &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;I found,&quot; which oddly is not irritating, but rather creates the feeling that the reader is simply listening to a learned scholar speak out loud. It feels very thorough, filling out every character's background and experiences -- yes, even the insignificant ones.<br />Like all Green Knight Press books I've purchased, this book has nice sturdy paper, clean text and a strong binding; like most of their books, it also has a great cover.<br />Any fan of Arthurian lore or fiction must read this book, for the sake of insight into characters large and small in books that you read.	2001-11-07

After the disastrous events of 9/11, I felt severely in the need for some kind of inspirational comfort, so I picked up &quot;The Christmas Box Miracle.&quot; Unlike his prior books, this is a an autobiography of Evans, and simultaneously a very unique success story -- not just because the book became popular, but how it affected the people who read it.<br />Evans was born into a middle-class Mormon family with several kids, who moved to Utah when he was still quite young. We get both visions of his family: the lighter side, with his rambunctious siblings and childhood antics, and the darker side, how his mother miscarried when he was a toddler, and suffered from severe depression that resulted in a failed suicide attempt.<br />A great influence on Evans was his grandfather, an immensely faith-filled man who predicted once that Evans would &quot;walk with the royalty of this earth and be known as one who loves God.&quot; A prediction which has since come true. The book then follows Evans in his careers as a missionary, a member of a newspaper staff, working for a tux rental agency, and so forth. It also follows him into his marriage with Keri, his wife (an interesting detail is who her crotchety father inspired *wink*). But after two of their children were born, it turned out that he was &quot;trading diamonds for stones,&quot; working too hard and missing out on his children.<br />Then, after the folding of his agency, Evans wrote a short novel that has now become famous, reaching across political, religious, age and financial barriers. &quot;The Christmas Box&quot; strongly affected everyone who read it, to the point where people were sending orders into bookstores for a novel that had, technically, never been published. His trip into publication was more than a success story, when it became a helping point for those who had lost a child.<br />It may be viewed as a mere coincidence that this book came out around the time of the WTC attack, but I doubt Evans' grandfather would see it so. This book is truly inspiring, especially given the short letters from people whom it has deeply affected, from across the world. (I, personally, have never lost a child but I was deeply traumatized by the loss of a baby brother, and &quot;Christmas Box&quot; helped me through that rough time) We are also given a look inside Evans' head, and the power of God that he's felt in his life.<br />As in his fiction, Evans is very spare and evocative in his descriptions, and very poetic in his speculations. There's an undercurrent of wry wit to this book, such as the passage where he relates how his brother got him to read classic authors by saying, &quot;Chicks dig Shakespeare.&quot; He also displays that success has not swelled his head, as he seems to have no problem relating that So-and-so and Such-and-Such did not like him, his problems and insecurities.<br />The book also gives background into the many people who were deeply touched by the Christmas Box (including the person who said that he was too young to have written such a book), and to the Angel Statues. I hadn't previously understood the meaning of these statues, and it's very moving when I did learn what they were for.<br />Maybe this story is even more inspiring than the Christmas Box, because it is REAL. I strongly advise everyone -- especially people who have read his other books -- to read this book.be viewed as a mere coincidence that this book came out around the time of the WTC attack, but I doubt Evans' grandfather would see it so.

Many aspects of this particular novel read like a paint-by-numbers fantasy: action! Adventure! Nasty nobles! A crumbling monarchy! Overdone enviroments! A beautiful hero(ine) discovering who she/he is! A few gratuitous monsters! Oh, the suspense...<br />This book starts off strong, with the Lady Alditha of the House Ash (four houses: Yew, Oak, Rowan and Ash) escaping from the wrath of the new queen. Alditha is pregnant with the king's illegitimate heir, and she is taken in by a wysen-wyf (wise-woman, witch) to give birth to her baby. She dies shortly thereafter, and the wysen-wyf Zazar names the child Ashen.<br />Years pass. House Ash is pretty much dead, Rown is following, the king is in a soused stupor and not expected to live long, the only known heir Florian is a sadistic brat, and the queen Ysa is willing to quietly &quot;silence&quot; anyone who threatens her control of her crumbling kingdom. Suddenly the king rallies, then sickens again, as the Rings of power (deep groan) magically zap from his hands to those of his wife. She knows that Florian is a sadistic brat, and that the Rings won't choose him--at the same time, she must deal with the fact that as a woman, she won't be allowed to rule officially, and about the strange rumors about a young woman near where Alditha died.<br />Meanwhile Ashen grows into a young woman, whose beauty is not lost on the muddy misfits in the village near Zazar's home, and who mistrust her as an Outlander. She narrowly escapes, venturing into the sickened land that her mother narrowly escaped, and finding the beginning of her destiny.<br />I had high expectations for this book, given Andre Norton's reputation. The book started off strong with the political strife, the escape into the swamp, and the mystery of Zazar. The problem is that when the initial thrill is over, the book settles into a slow, unimpressive pace unmarked by any future &quot;wows!&quot; or twists that we couldn't see a mile away. For example, when you hear that Kazi dislikes Ashen, you know precisely what actions Kazi will take many pages later. When you hear that the leader of the locals hates Ashen, you know she will have to escape them when they turn on her. You know that Ysa's son would be a scourge. And you know that there will be some slow-growing crisis that Ashen will, at some point, be called on to fix. (Why aren't prophetic heroes ever summoned for societal reform?)<br />In fact, Ysa herself is one of the sole aspects of the book that is original and fleshed out. She's an aging but perpetually brilliant woman, who craves power not just for herself, but for the continuation of what she believes is good. (And if she has to commit genocide to do so, fine). Her revulsion toward her soused, insensate husband and her irritating, weak son is well-drawn, as is her scheming to remain in power though she is a woman, and thus not allowed. She's bad, but she's a good character.<br />Oh yes, and Zazar. Zazar is an intriguing, Merlinesque character who lives on the fringes and has a definite flair, and an otherworldly presence, such as telling Ashen that when she dies a new wysen-wyf will emerge from her corpse. (Like the pheonix? Anyhow, very imaginative) Her pronouncements and foresights are downright chilling, in a good spinetingling sort of way. The giant luppers (think enormous carnivore frogs) are pretty chilling as well, as is &quot;Visp,&quot; the eerie little batcreature who spies for Ysa.<br />The problem is that while Ysa or Zazar would make an intriguing protaganist, the heroine is Ashen. And she lives up to her name: her character is neither really bad or really outstanding, she's overall pretty blah. She doesn't accomplish much on her own, drifting through her life and reacting to those around her. She is (of course) beautiful, smart, good and kind, a teenager without any problems like acne or gangliness (why is there never an average-looking hero-of-prophecy?); what is up with that cover? Her clothes are sagging down into the mud!<br />Prince Florian is evil, but not as textured as Sharon Shinn's Bryan in &quot;Castle Auburn,&quot; Kazi is a typical sniveling traitor, and there is the typical monarchy-political strife. (Everyone wants to rule!) The idea of rival dynasties is not new, and Patricia McKillip put the extermination, escape and retaliation in better form in Song for the Basilisk. I was intrigued by the idea of carefully kept trees whose presence mirrors the &quot;health&quot; of the rival houses; I cringed at the idea of magical rings &quot;choosing&quot; who to bestow power on.<br />If you read any and all fantasy, or are a major fan of Norton, you may want to read this.

Patricia McKillip is one of the few authors who are truly worthy of being called a writer of epics and classics.<br />Her world is a relatively simple yet complex one, in which the Prince of the poor farming country of Hed, Morgan, is found to have solved the mysterious Riddle of Peven, an old King who had to give up his crown to Morgan. Also, the man who solves the Riddle will also get to marry a princess, Raederle, the second-most beautiful woman in the world. (She is also the star of book two)<br />But as Morgan ventures away from Hed, he learns that strange things are happening. Sinister shapechanging creatures are creeping in like a plague, and he begins to question the history of his world. Long ago, there were wizards in the city of Lungold, and now there are none. Their knowledge is left behind in the riddles that often crop up during the book -- but Morgan begins to suspect that the man who founded Lungold, Ghisteslwchlohm, is still alive.<br />Why Ghisteslwchlohm destroyed the city, and whether he is alive are only two of the strange mysteries (riddles?) that Morgan must face. Accompanied by Deth, the harper of the High One (a person who reads lots of McKillip knows that she loves harps), Morgan sets off to find the mysterious High One at Erlenstar Mountain. And the people he meet along the way help reveal the strange destiny that he has: the Star-Bearer, for the three stars on his brow. He learns new skills of shapeshifting and magic along the way to Erlenstar Mountain, where a shock awaits him...<br />Frankly a summary can't really express the complexity of this novel. This is only the bare bones of it. McKillip's prose in this book is not as lush or dreamy as her future books, but what there is in this relatively slim book (no 900-page tomes, thank God) is amazing. Like Tolkien, the villains of her books are more nebulous than cackling men in silly black armor -- the shapechangers are all the more sinister for their creepy lack of presence, but their effect on the lands in the book. The scene where a shapechanger sings a song about Hed to Morgon is one of the creepiest I've seen in ages.<br />There are no elves, dwarves, faeries, or similar fantastical creatures in this book. It came to me with a bit of a shock at the end that there were only humans in this -- humans who can learn magic, who make mistakes and who have to search for the truth instead of having it handed to them on a plate. The magic is learnable -- and isn't flashy or show-offy, but subtle and pervasive. Similarly, the shapechangers' menace isn't overdone -- a few passages, a couple of sinister confrontations that seem almost dreamlike. And this makes them all the more freaky.<br />McKillip's fondness for little in-jokes shows here, as the riddling Morgan is the prince of &quot;Hed&quot;; he comments in one scene that &quot;Deth harped at his father's wedding&quot;. And she doesn't do overwrought, complex names like N'garle Tor'bane: simple names like Aum, Peven, An, Re, Rood -- aside from Ghisteslwchlohm, the most complex name is Raederle's, and it all adds to the poetry of the prose.<br />And McKillip also does something that Tolkien also did, and which many fantasy authors don't do: She leaves many things up to our imagination. For instance, the Great Shout: We're not entirely sure what it is, we're not sure how the characters do it, but we do know that it is awe-inspiring and we want to learn it too. Similarly, we don't get lengthy monologues about the magic that Morgan learns how to transform into a vesta, but the FEEL of it is clear and present.<br />Morgan is a great reluctant hero, whose main hope is to marry Raederle, go home to Hed, and fix Snog Nutt's roof. He gets sucked into one situation after another while trying to turn back on his destiny, and deny that it would have dire consequences. The reader breaths a sigh of relief when he finally accepts it and moves toward Erlenstar (isn't that a great name?). Deth is amazingly ambiguous, a likeable character though he is secretive and may not be entirely trustworthy. He's also a nice change from the Gandalf/Merlin stereotype. We also get likable supporting characters like Morgon's buddy Rood, shapeshifting Har, the stately Morgol of Herun (who reminds me of Galadriel) and her brave daughter.<br />I'm looking forward to reading &quot;Heir of Sea and Fire&quot; and &quot;Harpist in the Wind,&quot; the next two books in the trilogy. (They aren't available independently, but are now available as a single volume--a beautiful one at that) These books are truly epic classics, a must-read for any lover of fantasy.finally accepts it and moves toward Erlenstar (isn't that a great name?).

Cherryh. Though hardly perfect, this is a solid story for Arthuriana and SF fans alike.<br />An extremely wealthy woman named Dela owns a luxurious spacecraft called the &quot;Maid of Astolat,&quot; which is decorated with swords, spears, medieval banners, and other trappings reminiscent of Arthurian legend. As if that weren't enough, she has specially programmed clones (&quot;made people&quot;) whom she has fashioned and named after characters in Arthurian legend: Sweet, meek Elaine; handsome, sad Lancelot (Lance); dark, brooding Modred; handsome lithe Gawain (Wayne); sharp, efficient Viviane, and lesser characters Percival and Lynette. Elaine narrates, a rather flat character who apparently gets her &quot;dreams&quot; by using special tapes that Dela owns.<br />These clones help to keep the ship running, except for Lance who is something of a slave boy-toy for Dela. She often brings her lovers to the &quot;Maid&quot;, and after she tires of them she falls back to Lance. But one day she brings in a new lover, Griffin--young, handsome, kindly, and she may actually marry him. This worries the clones, who fear that they will be put down or reprogrammed.<br />But their worries become irrelevent when the ship is yanked into a sort of space-wasteland, and clamped onto an alien ship. The clones begin to freak out (or &quot;blank out,&quot; as they do when they're upset), Dela decides that they are all dead, and Griffin tries to help the clones free the ship. But something strange is drawing nearer to the &quot;Maid,&quot; and will draw them into a situation that no one can truly understand--and the question of what being a person is.<br />This novella initially seems like a simple Star Trekkian adventure, but also introduces some intriguing moral questions. Do programmable clones have souls? What does it imply about the morals of a person who uses clones like wind-up toys? If they have stunted abilities to feel, and are &quot;programmed&quot; to obey a person, does that make them any less human than a &quot;born man&quot;? These questions are raised and answered without preachiness, but through effective demonstration.<br />Anyway, the characters were excellently made. The selfish, hedonistic Dela is forced to see the clones as people, and to act as a better person, and Griffin is definitely a &quot;nice guy,&quot; though a little less so at the beginning. Lance is broody, Modred is sinister (yet, somehow, I like him!), Viviane is effective as the ice-queen with a head for figures. Percival is a sweetie some of the time. Gawain and Lynette don't register as much, but perhaps the biggest cast flaw is Elaine. She seems too passive as a narrator, doing too much telling and not enough doing, in a crisis situation. But her stunted love for Lancelot is very effectively shown.<br />Though there is minimal profanity, hardly any violence and just a little gross imagery (the attack on Modred), there is a fair amount of sex-related info in this. Dela brings man after man for trysts on her ship (we're told, but not shown), Lance is her boytoy, and there are a couple scenes where Lance goes to bed with Elaine. None of this is graphic; in fact, it's rather how you would expect the observations and experiences of an android to be. Perhaps the contrast between the love lives of the people involves and the growing soul love is deliberate. Additionally, one can also see traces of traditional Arthuriana, with Dela as Guinevere, Griffin as Arthur, Lancelot and Elaine in their ancient counterparts' places.<br />And thankfully Cherryh did not fall into the trap of &quot;bad alien captures heroes, heroes defeat alien and escape.&quot; Rather, she introduces a situation as ambiguous as several characters are, and allows us to see a vision of the future that is truly intriguing, and which fits perfectly into the thoughts and desiresof the characters.<br />Overall, an excellent read for Arthurian and SF fans.of the characters.<br />Overall, an excellent read for Arthurian and SF fans.	2001-11-06

This book could have been trite and ordinary--instead, it's a masterpiece.<br />Wild Rois, the second daughter of a prosperous farmer, lives with her father and soon-to-be-married sister, Laurel. Rois roams the fields and woods, while Laurel is a sedate homebody. But everything is changed when a young man, Corbet, moves in nearby. Corbet's grandfather was killed in the near area by his father, and reportedly there is a curse on them all. Rois becomes fascinated by Corbet and the reported curse, digging deeper and deeper into realms where mortals aren't meant to go.<br />She investigates into the decrepit manor where Corbet lives, and encounters both the living and the dead, sucked into an otherworld where an icy woman wants Corbet. Neither Rois nor the reader will really be able to rest until Corbet is freed from the curse -- even as we learn what makes Rois so different from the people around her.<br />Rois is a unique character, and her attempts to free Corbet had me cheering, especially as I wanted Perrin and Laurel to get back together. The love triangle is saved from triteness, with Laurel pining after Corbet and Perrin irritated that his ex-fiancee is flinging herself at a cursed, mysterious stranger. Despite this fact (and the fact that we know that brooding Corbet and otherworldly Rois are better suited), Laurel is not annoying, and the reader becomes genuinely concerned when she becomes &quot;ill.&quot; The nature of this illness is strange as well, sort of losing one's taste for the real world and slowly drifting out of life.<br />The stories of the curse and what happened those years ago becomes so twined with Rois's investigations on herself and her family. It has the trappings of a very ordinary book, but the dream/reality blurring make it very UNordinary. In fact, at times it's difficult to tell just what's happening. I had to read the end several times over to fully pull in what was going on.<br />The writing is, as always, dreamy and gorgeous. I did feel that this novel wasn't quite as tight as &quot;Song for the Basilisk&quot; where it's dreamy reality, rather than dreamy reality/dreamy dream, which this novel qualifies as.<br />If you are a big fan of sword-and-sorcery fantasy, you probably won't like this book.

1786833:US	50881246	R1EXMQH6MCF3ED	0812511816	456114433	The Eye of the World (The Wheel of Time, Book 1)	Books	2	74	124	N	N	How can I say this nicely?	This book reads like a serious version of the Diana Wynne-Jones &quot;Tough Guide to FantasyLand,&quot; a melding of both Tolkien and Star Wars along with prose as dense as a fruitcake. I assure you that I went into EOTW with an open mind, and found moderately entertaining, FLAWED fantasy.<br />The opening itself is standard, somewhat reminiscent of &quot;Sword of Shannara&quot;: Our Hero, Rand, glimpses a dark-robed figure in the forest, which vanishes quickly. He and his father immediately head back to the village of the Two Rivers, the usual country bunch who are currently preparing the Bel Tine (Beltaine?) celebration.<br />However, strangers have come into the village: The mysterious Moraine, whom we find out is an Aes Sedai (a female magic-user -- apparently men can't) and the dark, growly, gray-haired, outdoorsy Lan (think Aragorn with more of an attitude). Then Rand and his father Tam's farm is attacked by trollocs, which are sort of half-man with a hodgepodge of animal bits. Soon after comes a ghostly Fade -- and they're searching for Rand, for reasons he doesn't know.<br />The locals (who don't seem to be the brightest bulbs in the chandelier) become angry, saying it's Moraine's fault. Moraine and Lan leave -- but with them come Rand, his semi-girlfriend Egwene, and a couple others. And along the path ahead, Rand discovers who he is and more about the enormous tasks that he must do.<br />Let's get this out of the way: I have no problem with huge books. I read &quot;Hounds of the Morrigan&quot; in two days, read LOTR in a week, Sword of Shannara in three days. As for descriptive prose, I am Patricia McKillip's biggest fan, and nobody gets more flowery than she does. My problem was not how long it was, but how it BECAME that long.<br />As mentioned above, the prose is as dense as a fruitcake. In my own writing, I have a rule that landscapes and physical description will not exceed three sentences. Yet after the prologue (which is beautifully and evocatively written -- I only wish the rest of the book had matched it) we get enormous descriptions of virtually nothing -- page two, two paragraphs on the wooded area where Rand sees a specter. Yet simultaneously, we get very little description of the characters: I never got a mental image of Tam, Egwene, or Rand.<br />Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. The chase scene away from the village, with the Leathery Winged Avian (see &quot;Tough Guide&quot;) in pursuit was tense and fast-paced. Their stay in the inn radiated warmth and safety, and danger of the interlude where Rand is trying to escape from the trollocs.<br />Sadly, as &quot;harsil&quot; points out below, he also produces some really weird descriptions. I've never heard teeth click, seen anyone shake themselves, or seen someone widen their eyes until the pupils vanished. And there might be an error in the VERY FIRST SENTENCE of the book: &quot;The palace still shook occasionally as the earth rumbled in memory, groaned as if it would deny what had happened.&quot; Did he shift tenses, or just write a correct sentence that sounds strangely like he did? (I really am not sure)<br />But unfortunately it also draws from every cliche in the book -- Wynne-Jones's book. We have the mysterious stranger (though in a twist, the &quot;Gandalf&quot; person is a woman); we have the hardy outdoorsman should-be-king (is that you, Aragorn?); we have the naive young hero who is a pale copy of Luke Skywalker -- raised in a backwater place with no knowledge of his exalted true identity and hidden power.<br />We have the necessary buddies like Mat and Perrin and Egwene; we have Leathery-Winged Avians, innkeepers, sinister Dark Lords, the &quot;One Power&quot; which closely resembles the Force, ghastly inhuman foot soldiers (not too scary though), the Lost Identity of the Hero, the &quot;Fade&quot; which is too much like a Nazgul, the poisoned wound that Tam got from an &quot;evil knife&quot;, the quest, etc. The cliches stack further and further up.<br />There are also, sadly, only a few really juicy characterizations. The women are all screechy, picky harridans who talk about what pains men are -- except for Moraine, thank God, who seems to regard everyone in the same level view. Did Jordan start this series after a nasty breakup? It's the only explanation I can think of; if aliens used this book to understand human gender relations, they'd wonder why we weren't extinct.<br />I got sick of Nynaeve after about a page, and Egwene started grating on my nerves after she discovered that she had Aes Sedai potential; Lan's disdain for Mat, Rand and Perrin seemed unnecessary and unheroic. Mat somehow didn't register much with me, but I liked Perrin. Rand did give the accurate feeling of a naive farmboy.<br />Jordan does provide some intriguing concepts, concerning the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; and the Dragon Reborn. But these are drowned in another problem: He has so many different cultures and hierarchies and organizations that I lost track very quickly. Realistically, the heroes shouldn't know much or care much about the groups that don't involve them. (Patricia McKillip realized this in her books: less is more)<br />Overall a nice brain-fluff read, certainly better than the &quot;Iron Tower&quot; trilogy but by no means as good as &quot;Sword of Shannara&quot; and definitely not as good as Tolkien or McKillip. I'd advise reading this only if you're unaffected by cliches.er and further up.<br />There are also, sadly, only a few really juicy characterizations.

This one, however, can't be described as fun -- or even very good -- by any stretch. Imaginative, yet flat.<br />Arthur de Caldicot is a teenage boy living on a rather sickly manor in Wales, whose diary this book supposedly is. (Is it just me, or are the pages kind of thick?) His father's friend Merlin gives him a piece of stone (hence, the title) that gives Arthur flashes of times past--of another Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, whose life as the \\"once and future king\\" was eerily similar to Arthur'as own.<br /><br />Why are they so similar? What is the meaning of this? What is the present Arthur's destiny, is it linked to the man who was so like him in prior eras? These questions are partly addressed in this book (since it's a trilogy, this book really cannot stand alone) amid a bog of historical details, and the resolution just doesn't feel satisfying to me.<br /><br />This sort of storyline was the reason I read this in the first place. It's imaginative, intelligent, has never been done in such a manner before, and definitely deserving of a look. The problem is that the author doesn't flesh out his prose or characters well. He TELLS rather than SHOWING. I know this is a diary, first-person format but it is possible to have Arthur describe things well.<br /><br />Characterizations are all kinda flat. I didn't really feel drawn into any of the characters present. In addition, the parade of historical facts, politics, and interactions are impressive. Perhaps a little TOO impressive. Historical accuracy should never bog down a book, and details should not overwhelm the plot and characterizations. He does create some intriguing new descriptive terms -- not dumb ones.<br /><br />Another problem is Oliver, the priest. He's a big walking cliche of Roman-Catholic priests, unbending, pampered, snooty and self-righteous; he does, of course, spout Catholic doctrine that is carefully twisted into a half-lie. (Frankly I found Arthur's thoughts about him more than a little nasty and self-righteous as well) Crossley-Holland appears to be unaware that this particular nasty little cliche only detracts from the plot. (I wonder, how long will it be before we see nasty, stuck-up, pampered DRUIDS in these Arthurian books? It would only be fair)<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book only if you're a devourer of all things Arthurian. I rate it two stars for the intriguingly original concept and the historical accuracy. For a nasty cliche and flat characters, I detract two stars from my initial rating. I hope the next two books are better.ng, pampered, snooty and self-righteous; he does, of course, spout Catholic doctrine that is carefully twisted into a half-lie.

Famed writer Terry Pratchett has amassed a huge readership in the UK, and a smaller but still BIG readership in the USA. With all that backing his books, he apparently has chosen to branch out and experiment a little in his latest ventures. And this experiment is a roaring success.<br />I was a little nervous about this book, afraid that with big full-color pictures...it would have a lame storyline and just be good pictures. I was grateful to be wrong; in recent years some of Pratchett's books have taken a more serious slant, but this book shows what he is best at: Poking fun. His rapier-sharp wit takes on the barbarians in the typical fantasy novels, as well as god pantheons and a bit of space travel to boot.<br />Cohen the Barbarian was a fearsome hero once before, leader of the Silver Horde. He's pretty old, though, as one can see from the cover--though he often loses his false teeth, he's still pretty feisty and remembers the old days where you could pillage, plunder and \\"ravish\\" without that pesky civilization thing getting in the way. So he concocts a scheme: Blow up the gods. There are two teensy problems: The gods are incredibly powerful, and if he were to succeed, Discworld would end.<br />Patrician Vetinari gets news of this, as the Silver Horde (assorted decrepit barbarians: Boy Willie, Truckle the Uncivil, Mad Hamish) travels to the hub of Discworld (where the gods live) with a kidnapped minstrel (to compose a saga about this last amazing heroic quest) and Vena the Raven-haired, an ex-warrior babe who isn't so raven-haired anymore. (She's in better shape than the Silver Horde, tho). They also team up with an ex-Dark-Lord, Evil Harry Dread, who's gotten out of the Dark Lord business and is as old as the rest of them (though considerably saner)<br />Vetinari doesn't intend to let them end the world, however. So he enlists Leonard of Quirm, an immensely talented inventor from a prior book. Leonard creates a spacecraft-like device, and fan faves Carrot and cowardly wizard Rincewind join the mission (and the Librarian). They'll encounte aging barbarians posing as minor gods, the pantheon of deities, dragons of several breeds, zero-gravity comedy, Death's cameos, elephant legs, and will actually walk on the moon!<br />Where to start? Well, the story itself is hilariously told (well duh, it's Pratchett), about barbarians and kick-butt heroines, Dark Lords and nefarious henchmen, straight out of any hack fantasy work--with the small problem that they're all about eighty years old. Since we never see aging hack heroes/villains in other novels, this is a refreshing change. It's also great to see fan faves like Leonard (Leonardo da Vinci of Discworld), naive Carrot, and Rincewind who still doesn't want to be on adventures but has to go anyway. The Librarian gets a bit more action than in many Discworld books!<br />Dialogue is great as always, especially the delicious scene where Cohen and Evil Harry Dread meet up again: \\"You've GOT to let the Dark Lord escape.

They're excellent. Many fans may not like having pix of such characters as the Patrician, Rincewind, etc shown to them rather than imagining their own, but I enjoyed them overall. Rincewind's shrinking appearance and sort of tattered beard and clothes are great; Patrician looks sufficiently sinister; the Librarion looks kooky (or \\"ook-y\\"); we also get clear views of such characters as Leonard, trolls, Death (with a little kitty), and what the sinister dragon-armor of a Dark Lord looks like after about forty years.<br />Carrot was the only one I was disappointed in--that face looks too hard to be our Carrot!

1802445:US	50881246	REMITA3LR6LM2	0312193262	32125221	The Royal House of Monaco: Dynasty of Glamour, Tragedy and Scandal	Books	4	14	15	N	N	&quot;Royals&quot; without the lies	John Glatt pens a more truthful version of &quot;The Royals,&quot; with less favoritism and more fact. Admittedly this isn't the British royal family (who have provided us with entertainment for many years) but a lesser-known (and no less juicy) dynasty, the Grimaldi's of Monaco.<br />Monaco first came to attention when Prince Rainier married the film star Grace Kelly, who brought glamor and modernity to the teeny little country. Grace's past -- involving multiple love affairs -- was swept out of sight as she ascended to the glamorous -- and severely stress-inducing -- position of princess, wife and mother. Rarely happy in her long and paparazzi-studded marriage, she nevertheless gave it her darndest and died tragically and suddenly when she was starting to find fulfillment again.<br />The book shifts focus after Grace's death in a car accident, to her three *ahem* spirited children: Caroline, who married one playboy after another, got pregnant out of wedlock, and once burst out of her top at a club, then had to shift into the social position that her mother left vacant. Albert, a playboy himself, who played around with one woman after another but wouldn't make even a vestige of commitment--even to one ex-girlfriend who had his baby, Tamara Rotolo. Stephanie, who shocked Monaco with her wild antics, drug use, explicit singing career and wild modelling career, bodyguard live-in boyfriend, and humiliating divorce after marrying said boyfriend.<br />Sound like a tabloid? Well, that's a royal family for you. Fortunately, Glatt doesn't speculate on the inner thoughts of the Grimaldi family (said to be under a curse from a witch raped by a Grimaldi) but allows their actions to speak alone. His writing style is pleasant to read, and gives us insights that other biographers apparently didn't get. I especially enjoyed the interviews with Cassini (Grace's ex-fiancee) Robyns who wrote a steamy biography but edited it at Grace's request, excerpts from members of the Grimaldi family, and from people who knew/know them.<br />This is hardly flawless. He describes Grace as a devout/militant Catholic, yet chronicles love affairs (with men married and single), an abortion, astrology beliefs, etc. Sorry, these are not the actions of a &quot;militant&quot; Catholic, though admittedly it is possible that she confessed these to a priest (something we will never know). He does occasionally linger on stuff that is more than we want to know, but it does give us a good look at the Grimaldis.<br />Stephanie, Caroline and Albert have already been in the spotlight, tabloidwise, so I suppose Glatt felt that there was no real reason to sugarcoat things. Rainier gets away the easiest, for though he was unfaithful to Grace during their marriage, very little space is given to it (as compared to Albert's girlfriends, Stephanie's partying days, etc).<br />In recent years the Grimaldis seem to have calmed down, but this book is nevertheless a heckuva read.

I must have a streak of masochism -- or I just have an optimistic hope that Atwater-Rhodes improve. She definitely can, but her books have been getting worse as they've increased in size.<br />Sarah Tigress Vida (\\"Tigress\\"?) is a vampire slay... I mean, a vampire HUNTER, who generally stalks around vampire lairs with silver knives (I thought silver was supposed to affect werewolves, not vampires?) and kills vampires when she can. Her mother is Dominique Vida, a character mentioned in \\"Demon\\"; her father was killed when she was seven, an event that traumatized her, and her sister Adrianna thinks she's treading into dangerous turf. Sarah has every intention of capturing a particularly vicious vampire named Nikolas, who gets his kicks (and his followers) by carving his name into their arms.<br />Sarah befriends Christopher and Nissa, a pair of young vampires who apparently don't attack humans. Christopher is sweet, writes poetry, and is completely smitten with Sarah (whoa, what a surprise. Anyone else see this coming? Why is it that people of the opposite sexes in this imaginary world either despise each other or fall in love?)<br />Unfortunately, her fellow witches (Adrianna in particular) have a problem with this -- their law forbids it, and Dominique is an ice-cold walking punishment. But as Sarah hunts down Nikolas, she treads a dangerous line between the vampire world, where her love interest still is bound, and the world of the witches where she may become an outcast as she tries to hunt down a ruthless vampire killer.<br />Mary-Sueism strikes again; after dealing with the amoral and unsympathetic Jessica in \\"Demon,\\" we must deal with gorgeous blond toughie Sarah, who is slightly more sympathetic than Jessica and who thankfully is not a teen vampire author. But the only vulnerability we see in her is never exploited, and we see few insecurities, leaving her a Buffy-clone with little personality. Christopher could have been the most intriguing character of all, but Atwater-Rhodes spends so little time on him that it's hard to see what motivates him except guilt. Oh, and his poetry isn't so good. (He rhymes \\"light\\" with \\"night.\\" I rhyme it with \\"trite\\") Nissa is slightly more explanatory, given her anecdotes to Sarah, but sadly we don't see much after that meeting. Adrianna is a typical tattler, and Dominique is a two-dimensional ... well, amazon won't let me use the word. It rhymes with \\"itch,\\" though.<br />The only truly three-dimensional character is Nikolas, oddly enough. Though initially portrayed as a psychopath, he is a killer but not a monster. These moral question marks are just screaming to be explored in more depth, but she leaves them dangling. The last quarter of the book happens too fast, as does the so-so relationship between Sarah and Christopher (whom she distrusted and then beat up during the course of the book).<br />And one of the twists leaves the reader unsatisfied--didn't we see this event in \\"Demon\\"? Has she taken to ripping herself off?<br />Perhaps Atwater-Rhodes' biggest problem is pandering to the basic teen market. Her first book was somewhat unique in that it featured a lead character who stays in the shadows, and no romance. After that, however, she has lapsed into tepid teen romances and lead characters in high-school. (Why the heck would vampires attend a high school?)<br />Another note: All of her lead human/witch characters are teens, the vampires were all changed as teenagers. All of them are gorgeous, or at least charismatic (this charisma often didn't reach the reader) and most of them do act like spoiled teens. And how many 17-year-olds have sapphire Jaguars? Other problems include the fact that Miss Atwater-Rhodes is starting to inject her religion into this: Wicca. This detracts from the mystery of the non-human witches, by grounding them in a very human religion.<br />Miss Atwater-Rhodes has talent, and she has imagination. Her first book displays this.<br />I'll keep hoping that Atwater-Rhodes improves her stories, and creates a lead character like Risika who is not a pale copy of her or Buffy, and a universe populated by intriguing and original species who are carefully shown in the detail they deserve.nding them in a very human religion. <br />Miss Atwater-Rhodes has talent, and she has imagination.

But I and many others Iove wizards. As the title suggests, this is a collection of some of the best wizard stories out there, by some of the best writers of fantasy ever, including but not limited to: Jane Yolen, Ursula Le Guin, T.H. White, C.S. Lewis, George MacDonald, and so on.<br />Much of this material is excerpted from other books, such as Le Guin's story (\\"Wizard of Earthsea\\"), George MacDonald's (\\"At the Back of the North Wind\\") and several others. While readers may have heard of some of the books (\\"Wizard of Earthsea,\\" \\"Wizard's Hall,\\" the Narnia Books) this is a good introduction to other works by older authors, like T.H. White's excerpt from \\"Once and Future King,\\" Phillippa Pearce, George MacDonald (who died before Tolkien!), Beowulf (the one excerpt that may be beyond the average 9-12 reader); and a few of those who are simply obscure like Mark Helprin and Nikolai Gogol. (Not all the excerpts are from wizard-related books, tho)<br />On a non-reading level, this book is beautifully bound with a gorgeous cover, though a little pricey for a paperback, in my humble opinion. Nevertheless, if you are not acquainted with some or all of the authors inside and/or are looking for good wizard stories, look no further. It's a good way to kick off  your fantasy reading.	2001-10-09

In his first work since the epic Merlin series, Barron returns to those roots (pun intended) in a delightful, smaller tale that any fan of his style will enjoy.<br />A young girl named Rowanna lives in a seaside cottage with an old man named Mellwyn, who found her abandoned under a tree when she was a baby. She is determined to find her mother and her past, but Mellwyn warns her that the forest around the High Willow is haunted by tree ghouls, which supposed are carnivorous, sharp-clawed creatures in their &quot;dark and shrieking groves.&quot; Despite his warnings, Anna makes her way closer to the forest, and befriends a tree spirit.<br />Even so, Mellwyn's protection starts to suffocate Anna as she searches for the truth. Disregarding his claims about terrible creatures in the forest, she ventures in to the High Willow on Hallows Eve. She soon finds that there are no tree ghouls, that Mellwyn has been keeping her outside the forest for a reason  and finds who and what she is.<br />As always, Barron doesn't resort to cheap tricks, strained plot twists or bids for character sympathy. He simply lets the story unfold in a very simple but beautiful way, with his usual excellent prose lacing the storyline. In size and complexity, this may be a little more suited to kids intimidated by the 300-plus books that he has penned before, but will give them a taste of Barron's writing. Speaking of his writing, it is less detailed than his books for older kids, but it retains the metaphors that help make his writing so unique: &quot;faded like a footprint in the sand,&quot; &quot;painted as bright as shells.&quot;<br />Anna herself is reminiscent of Rhia from the Merlin series, with her nature-oriented viewpoint and deep compassion for other creatures, such as the part with the little sparrow she rescues. It hints at her nature long before actually revealing who and what Anna is, without making her seem too peculiar. Mellwyn easily could have become a stereotype, but is thankfully saved from that. And despite the lesser role of Anna's friend he remains three-dimensional as well.<br />It's significantly shorter than all of Barron's prior 9-12 works, but is still an excellent read for people who enjoy his works.

Time to turn a sacred cow into hamburger--Terry Pratchett, having established wizards, witches, and cranky policemen in his famed, kooky &quot;Discworld,&quot; turns his attention to ancient Egyptianesque surroudings, here the city of Djelibeybi (say it out loud) and its unfortunate pharaoh.<br />Teppic is an unusually educated young pharaoh-to-be, the crown prince of Djelibeybi (&quot;Child of the Djel&quot;) whose father has a few seagulls in the attic, and overall is a harmless little guy. Teppic heads off to Ankh-Morpork to train to be an Assassin, but comes back home when his dad unexpectedly dies (it's unexpected because the poor guy thought he was a seagull and leaped off). Teppic is a relatively enlightening young man, who doesn't like feeding people to crocodiles, doesn't want to build a pyramid for his dad, isn't comfortable with being a living god, and doesn't relish the idea of marrying a close female relative.<br />Unfortunately, the high priest (who is clearly insane) is holding the reins and doesn't intend to give them up to an upstart pharaoh. Teppic isn't entirely sure what to do about Dios, but he's sure that Dios's age-old ways are not the best ways. It's the century of the fruitbat, and Djelibeybi should live it that way!<br />Among Dios's proclaimations is that the old pharaoh (who is hanging around with Death, and who wanted to be sent out to sea rather than sealed in a pyramid) be built a pyramid to end all pyramids. Enter some slightly deranged architects, who do their darndest to make it so. The problem is, the bigger the pyramid, the more likely it is to distort space-time  and this one proceeds to mess up the fabric of all Djelibeybi. Soon Dios is siccing the guards on Teppic and rebellious handmaiden Ptraci, the gods have come to life and refuse to behave  and over a thousand mummies are lurching out into Djelibeybi from their pyramids.<br />Terry Pratchett is at his best when he takes accepted history/events/fantasy and twists them into hilarity. He takes the most absurd aspects of Egyptian culture and makes them into the bizarre land of Djelibeybi. Not even the Egyptian gods are free from Pratchett's spoofery, running around creating havoc--not to mention the enormous dung beetle carrying the sun.<br />The teenage hero Teppic is an innocent bystander who just happens to be the sole legitimate heir of the old king, and his bewilderment at the various customs and traditions (which all date back centuries) is perfectly done. Ptraci is a typical Pratchett gal -- strong, independent, intelligent, and takes no guff from anyone, revealing handmaiden costume or none. The old king is also an enjoyable character, harmlessly nuts when he was alive, and when he died he ended up on a guided tour watching his own embalming (the poor guy has to watch his own organs being extracted, when all he wanted was to be sent out to sea), thus proving that Death is very willing to be nice. Accompanying them are Dios, the insane high priest who spends centuries controlling pharaohs, a bunch of freaked-out architects, a super-intelligent camel called &quot;You B*******&quot;, and a lot of deceased pharaohs (whose dialogue is priceless).<br />This book, like many of Pratchett's, is acceptable for kids as there is minimal profanity, no sex, and not really any violence. Teens may identify with Teppic and Ptraci, but they are excellent characters to be read about for any age group.<br />One of Pratchett's best novels.

In preparation for the three new live-action movies, the famed trilogy is rereleased.<br />Years before, the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron was discovered in the possession of the creepy Gollum - and came into the &quot;ownership&quot; of Bilbo Baggins, a pleasant hobbit in the middle of an adventure. Now, it is given to his relative Frodo, who soon encounters creatures both mesmerizing and evil in the Shire. Wizard Gandalf has him head off to the elf city of Rivendell, but along the way he is attacked and nearly killed by the sinister Black Riders. It is determined at Rivendell that the One Ring must be destroyed, and that Frodo's the hobbit to do it. With Gandalf, he sets off with a group of companions: the hobbits Sam, Merry and Pippin, men Aragorn and Boromir, elf Legolas, and dwarf Gimli.<br />They travel across the length of Middle Earth, from the beautiful gardenland of Lothlorien to the rotting wasteland of Mordor. Aragorn and the others will attempt to save the city of Minas Tirith from the armies of Sauron. Frodo and Sam will try to take the Ring to Mount Doom, the only place where it can be destroyed. But that will take a terrible price.<br />When this book was first published, Tolkien had no idea that he would jump-start the fantasy genre from an odd little collection of fiction to a major part of the book market and would inspire more ripoffs than any other author in history. Lord of the Rings is a sweeping epic of good and evil. Cliche? It is a cliche now, but it's also one LOTR spawned.<br />What sets it apart is two things: the Judeo-Christian morality and ethics that Tolkien held so dear, and the crafting of Middle-Earth. If one carefully examines the themes of temptation, redemption and punishment, as well as the innate nobility of the heroes. I also advise, to get the full effect of Tolkien's beliefs, that you read the Silmarillion.<br />Middle Earth is perhaps the most intricate fantasy world ever created, with Patricia McKillip's Riddlemaster trilogy's world as a close second. Tolkien crafted not just geology and various species for his world; he also created a religious background, complete with a God and a pantheon of deitilike angelic creatures, individual languages, cultures, and several outlooks that are alien to the other species. Add to this his poetic, strong descriptions, pleasant dialogue, occasional song or poem, and you have a true classic. The classic status is cemented into immortality by the fact that this was the first widely-read fantasy.<br />A recommendation: If you've already read the trilogy, then you may want to read two other intelligent trilogies, &quot;Children of the Star&quot; and &quot;Riddlemaster.&quot; Though they cannot match JRR (who can?) they are two of the best.<br />If you are one of the few people who has never read this trilogy: Put down your Harry Potter and read the story that introduced the world to fantasy.the most intricate fantasy world ever created, with Patricia McKillip's Riddlemaster trilogy's world as a close second.

Her lush writing, intricate stories and beautiful characters rise above the psuedo-intellectual bestsellers of today.<br />&quot;Crescent Carnival&quot; is one of my favorites, the story of three generations of women who fall in love (or don't) with the handsome, dashing Breckenridge men. It spans the years from 1890 to 1940, in the lush surroundings of New Orleans. It's really more like three novelettes rather than a book on its own.<br />The first part is about Estelle Lenoir, a wealthy, naive Creole beauty who is destined to be married to dull but kindly Marcel. The problem is that Estelle has fallen madly in love with Andy Breckenridge, a handsome young man with dark whisperings, who is often shunned from the politer parts of New Orleans society (including Estelle's parents). Estelle, who has been carefully guarded from the less savory aspects of life, now is exposed to the dark secrets of Andy's past. She must choose between her love for him and her fear of what he might turn her life into.<br />The second part involves Andy's son Breck, who is married to a wife from Boston; Anna is shrewish, hypocritical, bigoted, cares little for children, hates New Orleans, and cares more for how things look and whether they are sufficiently New-England-ish than whether they are comfortable and pleasant. Breck has a vague idea that this is a rotten deal for him, but not much more than that. He soon gets back in touch with &quot;Aunt&quot; Estelle and her two children, the rather foppish Olivier and the lovely, innocent Marie Celeste. When Breck goes back to his old family plantation, Anna begins a rather desperate flirtation with Olivier, while Breck falls in love with Marie Celeste. But can he be with the woman he loves?<br />The third story involves Olivier's daughter, Stella (named after Estelle). Stella, like her grandmother, is a society beauty in a rapidly-changing enviroment, while Estelle is saddened to see the world that she knew as a girl and a younger woman falling away. Though it is assumed that Stella will wed Drew Breckenridge (Breck's son), she surprises everyone by falling in love with a young Cajun man named Raoul Bienvenu. And the rather dowdy yet goodhearted Patty Forrestal, a distant relation of Drew's grandmother, has fallen in love with Drew...<br />For a book about tragic losses and separations, somehow this book never becomes depressing. Perhaps it's the lack of deathbed musings and endless weeping about lost characters; the deaths or losses of the assorted characters are either handled quickly, offstage, or in newspaper clippings. It remains kind of upbeat, in fact. The descriptions of New Orleans<br />The characters are beautifully made. Estelle is a well-fleshed-out character, going from a naive young beauty to a strong, tragic matriarch. Andy Breckenridge is a rather stereotypical devilishly-attractive rake, but he is less interesting than Estelle's reactions and responses to him. Breck, unlike his father, is sympathetic and well-done, a guy who just wants a happy hope, lots of kids, and a wife who doesn't sit there and carp at him. Anna is a pushy, dominating shrew who demands that New Orleans adjust to fit her tastes. Marie Celeste is lovely, and Olivier is a pain.<br />The third part may be the weakest, as instead of a slow buildup to the romance, we are flung straight into it before getting to know Stella or Raoul or Drew very well. (Patty we get to know earlier on) When Stella and Raoul are engaged, the reader thinks, &quot;What? Already? How many hours have they known each other?&quot; I found Drew and Raoul to be intriguing, Stella less so as she seems a bit disrespectful to Estelle and a bit two-dimensional. She doesn't have the depth of Caresse in &quot;Dinner at Antoine's,&quot; and the third story seems a little desperate to bemodern. But she fleshes out late in the story, becoming a young woman thwarted in her first love and afraid to love again; Patty becomes less sympathetic, making a ridiculously sexist statement that she was born to love her husband and have babies. I found Stella's balance of singing and love far more palatable.<br />Never has New Orleans seemed as enticing as it does here, with the beautiful buildings, intriguing social structures, lovely nature descriptions and intricate family lines. Keyes wrote with excellent prose in the descriptions of it all. There are a few hints at illegitimacy, seduction, hideous disease, but the book is overall quite appropriate for teens (if they don't mind an 800-page book)<br />This book does not deserve to be out of print.

Sometimes this novel feels a bit like a Barbara Michaels novel under the wrong pseudonym, with the (discreet) sexy content and supernaturally loaded storyline, but it's an excellent read nonetheless.<br />Laurie is invited back to the secluded family hold of Idlewild, where she grew up with puritanical Aunt Ida, animal-loving Uncle Ned, and fluttery whimsical Aunt Lizzie (who once tried to get signals from Arcturus, decided she was a reincarnated Egyptian princess, etc). Also coming back is her half-brother Doug; the reason why is that Lizzie's latest whim is somehow alarming -- she claims there are fairies in the woods.<br />The problem is, she isn't acting as she usually does during &quot;whims&quot;, and she has photos with eerie-looking humanoids that do look alarmingly like malevolent fairies. There is also a newcomer nearby: the tall, dark and sexy Jefferson, the handyman/author who lives with the old people. And there are &quot;old friends&quot;: a repressed religious fanatic who maltreats his family (because his daughters, especially the beautiful eldest, are &quot;vessels of iniquity&quot; and fiction is &quot;lies&quot;) and most horribly of all, Hermann, the suitable, dull, pompous guy that Ida spends the whole book trying to fix Laurie up with.<br />But Hermann is not the primary problem on Laurie's mind. She's heard and seen mysterious lights and sounds out in the woods. Then, Lizzie's photos are stolen, and someone tries to run Laurie down. She and Doug must unravel a bizarre mystery with roots back in their respectable family -- but can Laurie even trust Doug? Can she trust Jefferson? And what dark secrets lurk in the woods?<br />Most Elizabeth Peters novels are pretty clean; this one rises a bit further, including Doug's ridiculous porn book (no excerpts, just the cover art), incest jokes, an underage love affair, dark family secrets, etc. And there is a bit of a weird feeling when Doug's secret is revealed (and Laurie's reaction to it). We are also given outrage, in the form of the obsessively religious woman-hater. At the same time we are graced with humor that few books can rival: we get those hilarious interludes with Hermann and his heavy-handed flirtations, as well as his sister flashing her bosom in poor Doug's face.<br />Laurie is practically trademarked as an EP/BM character, strong and self-reliant, with a barbed wit and none of that swooning business. Doug and Jefferson are a bit harder to classify, as both are ambiguous in the trust area in different parts of the book; they do, however, possess characteristics of the usual EP/BM hero (wit, intelligence, deception, big flaws yet are lovable), making it even more difficult to tell. Old fashioned Aunt Ida and Uncle Ned are endearing in their quieter parts, while Aunt Lizzie may get on the readers' nerves occasionally, with her relentless fluttering and faked innocence.<br />Overall, a big thick fat book, that makes a perfect guilty pleasure.

Soon they are caught on a mystical struggle, with a bunch of unexpected new allies -- a huntress, a torc-alta, a bard with a hook rather than a hand, and a guy who controls one of the Elementals.<br />In short, this young and strong band much rescue the Book of Windlord from the island's evil emperor, Balor (whose name will be familiar to students of Irish myth) and his hideous army of reptilian warriors. In addition to this, Our Heroes must also find a way to get home to their own time and place.<br />Too many books collapse in under the wish to pander to mass tastes, simple sword and sorcery, and sacrifice the underlying tones that make them unique to start with. I include Celtic-influenced SF/F in that category. But often the best gems of this subgenre are to be found in smaller publishers, like &quot;Riddle of Roses&quot; and &quot;Knockabeg.&quot; These allow the full richness of the storytelling to be seen and felt, and this one does not skimp on the details that need to be handled.<br />The two human kids are saved from being standard by the excellent surroundings characters and how they interact. Though I felt the huntress was kinda flat, I liked the torc-alta, the bard and the Elemental lord. Balor is evil, nuff zed (although he is a villain that has been plumbed through many books, anyone with the name Balor remains utter evil).<br />The writing is excellent and high-paced, though I sometimes wished that Windlord was longer than it actually was. The cover art is amazing, with the four people riding on a reptilian beastie over a castle...<br />Overall, an engaging and exciting read. Well worth it.gaging and exciting read. Well worth it.	2001-09-17

The cliche are twisted into originality.<br />Anthony and his little sister purchase five figurines at a garage sale--little do they know what will happen when the figurines get wet. (Add water for instant life!) The figurines not only come to life, but to life-size, and the seven are promptly dragged into a truly madcap adventure worthy of the title.<br />It appears that the barbarian horde of the planet Flinduvia has sinister plans in mind for Earth. In a highly original dastardly plot, they plan to strip all the dead ghosts from Earth, reanimating dead warriors who will then proceed to take over the entire galaxy (of course *wink*). Anthony, Sarah and the five ex-figurines must been the Flinduvians at bay until the Coalition of Civilized Worlds can show up.<br />&quot;Monsters of Morley Manor&quot; gives the impression that focuswise, this book is similar to &quot;Pure Dead Magic.&quot; Such is not the case; this one is far broader in scope, given the weird mix of SF/F/H. We have galactice alliances and invaders from another world for scifi; we have wizards, vampires, werewolves and others for fantasy; we have reanimation of the dead and lawyers for horror.<br />However there is a sufficient amount of that kind of humor to satisfy those who liked &quot;Pure Dead Magic,&quot; including a creepy mansion; and the kind of weird originality that Coville fans crave is quite present. (I personally think Coville is improving his writing with every book) His writing style is brisk and a bit underdescriptive in places, though admittedly he can't get too darn descriptive, given the wide range of the plot and cast.<br />For those of you who grinned at &quot;Pure Dead Magic&quot;, grinned at the other (non-Unicorn) Coville books, and laughed yourself silly at the overwrought &quot;Shattered Mirror,&quot; this book is a nice read.,&quot; this book is a nice read.	2001-09-17

This book manages to portray junior gothicism with tongue planted firmly in cheek.<br />Signor Luciano Strega-Borgia vanished a month ago, prompting his household to deal with the situation. Signora Strega-Borgia is now working on her witchcraft course, and as a result the young children Titus (12), Pandora (10) and baby Damp (1 1/2) in the care of a new nanny. What else has happened? A henchman in a bunny suit, the baby getting uploaded onto the Web (fantasy for 2001!), the monsters in the castle (including a yeti, griffin, dragon...), a frozen grandma in the basement, and some delightfully over-the-top villains.<br />Indeed, this book may appeal to fans of Lemony Snicket, given that the lead trio (boy, girl, baby girl) is quite similar. This book, while equally amusing, does not possess the despairing tone but rather a darkly upbeat manner. There's also a bit of tech humor. Unlike the Harry Potter series, and like &quot;Artemis Fowl,&quot; this book fully acknowledges modern technology, enjoyably inaccurate as the idea of losing a little sister on the modem. At the same time, we are granted more traditional items such as the attempted murder of a character by his evil conniving brother.<br />The lead trio is plenty of fun, smart and gutsy kids who have enough of an edge to be above-average. The villains are... well, villains. They don't really amount to much more, but the bunny suit is worth it.<br />That is not to say this book is flawless. A few bits of potty-humor spring up that got a bit tiresome, and there are some plot holes that you could throw a basketball through (such as the call for help). However, because of the quirkiness of the plot many readers may simply shrug and say, &quot;Hey, it's fun.&quot;<br />Overall, an original fantasy. Hope the next two books are written!	2001-09-13

But it is not really suited for much other than research and background info. One of its problems is that it doesn't convey much emotion, sense of action, or anything else for that matter. The writing style is suitably mythologic, and it'll bore most younger readers (and even some older readers) straight into dreamland.<br />Normally that would gain it three stars, but there was another problem. If you are a Malory fan, you may want to read this more than I have. This book offers only a little more than Malory's legends--which lack the richness and fullness of the earlier legends, like Geoffrey of Monmouth or even the legends from before that. One point in its favor is that it does focus on various knights, instead of solely on the Camelot soap opera.<br />If you are seeking a generally-accepted Arthurian text for research or schoolwork, you may want this one. It isn't light reading, or even really counted as fiction.	2001-09-10

(She also ends the foreword with &quot;Don't take the narrator too literally, because she's unreliable in not only her life, but in the telling of her tale.&quot;)<br />Perhaps my favorite is dark fantasy &quot;The Splatterfairies&quot; (don't let the title turn you off), about what happens around people as they sleep. Similarly, don't skip &quot;Welcome to the Spaceport Brothel&quot; simply because of the title, it's an satirical glimpse of possible life in the next century, when a young cadet ventures out of his ship. &quot;The Eve of True Forms&quot; may be a fave for many readers of &quot;Dulcinea,&quot; given that it deals with a young witch and her boyfriend.<br />&quot;Cartoon-Logic&quot; is described as mind-bending, and rightly so. &quot;Rite of Passage&quot; is a tale about a cheerleader with a secret, and the results. There is also a dark story called &quot;Jeep Buddy and Pierce&quot; that is apparently a novella-in-progress--I'll look forward to seeing the entirety. There is also a short short story, and an interesting essay on fantasy.<br />An excellent book, one I enjoyed from a rising fantasy/fiction author.	2001-09-05

Mollie Hunter writes in a style unlike that of many 9-12 authors, and her story is a slow buildup to a shocking climax.<br />A small family in Scotland encounters a shipwrecked survivor, a handsome young man named Finn Learson. Finn rapidly endears himself to the family, especially to the pretty Elspeth. The only ones who don't like him are young Robbie, Old Da, Tam the dog, and Nicol, Elspeth's increasingly irritated fiancee. Old Da is the grandfather of the family, a learned storyteller who tells his grandson tales about the Great Selkie, a malevolent seal-man who roofs his crystal palace with the golden hair of girls he's married and pulled underwater.<br />Clues begin to come together as time goes on: Finn loves dancing and strange, eerie music; he has a golden piece of eight; an omen in the ashes; his ability to literally mesmerize; the way his hands feel. Robbie has a strange feeling about it all, and when Old Da suddenly falls ill, he reveals that a stranger like Finn came ashore years before. But he dies before he can tell Robbie all of it.<br />Finn's intentions toward Elspeth become clearer when he and Nicol begin openly vying for her affections. Elspeth is swayed by promises of wealth and prestige, but Robbie is beginning to realize that Finn is not even human. Desperate for someone to help him, he goes to the old eccentric Yarl Corbie, whose girlfriend was stolen away mysteriously many years ago...<br />Perhaps one of the few flaws with this book is that it really isn't a &quot;Tale of Suspense.&quot; Within the first fifty pages it's clear who and what Finn is, and what he's planning. However, this suspense is kept up by Old Da's last words and the mystery of Yarl Corbie.<br />Robbie is a fairly standard pre-adolescent, but his concern for his sister and liking for Nicol raise him above the average. We don't see enough of Old Da, nor of Yarl Corbie, who is a delectably sinister character with strange powers who adds a great deal to the plot. Elspeth is sadly a rather annoying character, who seems rather condescending even after the incident with Finn. I liked Nicol a great deal, and felt that he should have done better than Elspeth.<br />One thing that raises it above the ordinary is insight into old Scottish ways of living, surviving on the combined fishing and farming. Additionally, I liked the parts where the real seals are encountered, and the old legends about them and the Great Selkie; also, old Scottish traditions from the pre-Christian era.<br />Additionally, the book is worth it for the climax especially. The battle between Robbie, Nicol and Yarl Corbie and the increasingly sinister Finn Learson is fast-paced and almost horrifying in places, and the weird angles of Finn's power come across to the reader. Hunter's writing style is at its peak in that scene--elsewhere, it may lose younger readers with the more mythic pace and method.<br />An excellent fantasy, marred by only a few flaws.orbie, who is a delectably sinister character with strange powers who adds a great deal to the plot.

The authors include such greats as Anne McCaffrey, Terry Pratchett, Debra Doyle/James McDonald, Diana Paxson, and others.<br />McCaffrey's story is an excerpt of &quot;Black Horses for the King&quot;, a YA novel about a young boy named Galwyn, whose abusive uncle is shipping enormous Libyan horses for Lord Artos. Pratchett's story is the entertaining &quot;Once and Future&quot; about a time traveller who creates the sword in the stone. We see the roots of Nancy Springer's bittersweet &quot;I Am Mordred&quot; in the story &quot;Raven,&quot; in which young Mordred's soul is imprisoned in a raven's body. Doyle/MacDonald craft a hilarious story called &quot;Holly and Ivy&quot; about Lancelot having a little fun with Gawain.<br />The writing styles range from &quot;kooky&quot; (&quot;Holly,&quot; &quot;Once and Future&quot;) to detailed (&quot;Black Horses&quot;) to dreamy (&quot;Raven&quot;).<br />As a previous reviewer stated, the only flaw with this is the last story. Honestly, we've had enough drooling in the area of the former president, haven't we? The final story isn't really Arthurian at all.<br />However, the final story is the sole flaw. It is, overall, a lovely collection of highly original stories about Arthur, Merlin, and Camelot. A must-read for fantasy and Arthurian fans.	2001-09-03

Mary Lyons crafts an enjoyable fantasy, rather unlike any I've read before, mixing history and fantasy in a manner that's very appealing, especially to the Celtophile.<br /><br />Knockabeg is suffering a terrible blight on the potatoes - but this is not caused by a disease or insect, but a curse by the Nuckelavees. Soon after, the queen of the fairies known as the &quot;Trooping Ones&quot; declares war on the Nuckelavees, and the fate of the little Irish village lies in the outcome. The only one not fighting is Sticky. Sticky is a rather eccentric fairy, a member of the Council and now is assigned a young human boy named Eamon.<br /><br />But Sticky defies orders for reasons not yet known to the reader. Secrets and lessons are revealed as the book reaches the climactic battle between the faeries and the Nuckelavees.<br /><br />I've always been a sucker for Celtic-themed fantasies like &quot;Hounds of the Morrigan,&quot; &quot;The Stones Are Hatching,&quot; &quot;Hero's Song,&quot; and &quot;Riddle of Roses,&quot; and this one fits neatly into the same kind of niche. We are given a plausible place for a curse: potato famines, and an excellent portrayal of life during those famines.<br /><br />Sticky (despite the name) is a a good character with depth and mystery, though I found her less sympathetic than Eamon. Eamon is a really delightful hero, who captures the sympathy and does not let it go; the scene in the fairy world where he encounters a group of very special people was touching and beautiful to think of. The fairy world itself is one that I liked reading about, three dimensional and populated with interesting details that will probably get the attention of the reader.<br /><br />The prose is a little spare in parts, but overall a nice read. If you're into Celtic fantasy, be sure to pick up this book...	2001-08-29

It's the 1980s. Cathy is a business superwoman with her insecure, overweight, obsessive and still single self firmly planted in her own insane universe. (This is before she bought a dog, and while Andrea was still ranting against the male gender in general. Charlene is nebulous)<br />Cathy's colorful existance is marred by various problems: Irving gets laid off and moves in with her. Fourteen old boyfriends congregate in her living room. She goes on multiple biz trips--and ends up roped into giving speeches. Charlene gets engaged. Cathy dates a guy at the office--with embarrassing consequences. She also dates a health nut whose sole ambition to to perfect his pecs. Cathy confronts the pouffy taffeta dress, and makes the mistake of singing \\"Let's Get Physical\\" in an elevator full of men.<br />Cathy Guisewite's excellent insight into the single woman's mind is sharp as it's ever been in this vbook, with her drawing skills cute and just cartoony-enough. Cathy is funny, bewildered, and enjoyable as ever. You need not have been self-aware in the 80s to enjoy this book. (I wasn't, and I did)	2001-08-24

After reading the similar &quot;Cat Who Wished To Be A Man&quot; I expected excellence from this book. I was somewhat disappointed.<br /> Mallory is a young girl who loves stories about magic and wizards and so forth; she also lives in a village ruled over by the repulsive Squire Scrupner, who is milking the people for money while masking it under faux benevolence. But when she notices an oddity about an old oak, she finds a real live -- and very cranky -- wizard inside!<br /> Arbican was a powerful wizard who broke a certain law, and ended up sealed inside the tree. Thus, he hasn't been able to follow his fellow wizards across the sea, and his magic has gradually seeped away. Mallory agrees to keep Arbican a secret from her shrewish inkeeper and her spineless husband, and especially from Squire Scrupner.<br /> But soon Arbican is revealed to the Squire--who uses him as a scapegoat for the death of the old squire. Mallory and Arbican end up in a perilous situation, with the squire determined to commit murder again.<br /> It took me a while to understand why I disliked this book. Finally I figured out why: the story just lacks what we expect from Lloyd Alexander. With the greedy squire/mayor sapping money from the townsfolk, and the intervention of a magical being, it is similar in some respects to &quot;Cat&quot;, but lacks what made that other book so appealing.<br /> It lacks the supporting characters that Alexander does so well, and thus we get a rather stifling view of this invented land. His trademark humor and wit are rather underdone, as the only person with wit is Arbican and his seems to be a rather malicious one. Also, most of the characters other than Mallory are completely unsympathetic: The squire is detestable, so is the fawning woman that Mallory lives with, her husband is a first-order wimp, the farmer is a thief and child-abuser, his son is about the same, Arbican never apologizes for his snappishness or really does much at all, and only really shows much graciousness at the end.<br /> The story gets two stars for being written in Lloyd Alexander's excellent style, and also for featuring the nice, fantasy-fed heroine Mallory.<br /> Unfortunately Mallory cannot save this tale. I can only speculate that Alexander was experiencing a rather dreary view of humanity while writing this story, and scoot on to something else.is about the same, Arbican never apologizes for his snappishness or really does much at all, and only really shows much graciousness at the end.<br /> The story gets two stars for being written in Lloyd Alexander's excellent style, and also for featuring the nice, fantasy-fed heroine Mallory.<br /> Unfortunately Mallory cannot save this tale.

The little cat, who has the ability to speak, lives with crotchety wizard Stephanus, who stormed out of the village of Brightford when the people misused his gifts to them out of greed and malice. Stephanus keeps refusing to turn Lionel into a man, but finally does with the promise that Lionel will return when he's done. The cat-turned-man travels to Brightford, where his innocent nature rapidly gets him into hot water. Brightford is run by the rotten, greedy little Mayor Pursewig, who is trying to bully out everyone into his debt.<br />He ends up meeting the lovely (and very irritable) Gillian, a local innkeeper who is being threatened by Pursewig; also Owlbert, her little scrub-boy sidekick, and Doctor Tudbelly, a local medical charlatan with a good heart and a fondness for gratuitous Latin phrases. When the malicious Pursewig (whom Lionel repeatedly and innocently insults) and the equally rotten Swaggart decide to get rid of the newcomers, Lionel learns what it is to be a real human being.<br />This book isn't as emotionally deep as some of Alexander's works; nevertheless, it has an excellent message. Stephanus thinks that all humans are greedy and malicious, yet a guy called Tolliver informs Lionel at one point, &quot;what may be true for a cat isn't always true for a man.&quot; Lionel gets to see both sides of the coin: Swaggart, Pursewig and their greed and and injustice; Dr. Tudbelly, Gillian and Owlbert, his selfless friends who are willing to go the extra mile as he is for them.<br />Lionel's innocence is a good counterpoint to the more seasoned people; his innocent insults and occasional lapses into &quot;cattiness&quot; are very entertaining. Especially enjoyed his repeated claims that he's not a man, he's a cat. Gillian is vintage Lloyd Alexander, a tough and independent gal who isn't afraid to let the guy she loves know when he's being an idiot. Dr. Tudbelly will be recognizable to fans of Fflewddur Fflam, with his heart of gold and inability to get his potions straight.<br />We see too little of Stephanus to really form much of an opinion; I thought he was a bit hard on Lionel. Pursewig is the secondary kind of fantasy villain, the mewling, cowardly, rather pathetic type. Swaggart seemed like more of a real menace, as he is amoral and has the muscle to back it up.<br />Alexander's trademarked humor is sprinkled throughout this tale, with such things as the newly-human Lionel bounding into Stephanus's lap, and Stephanus announcing, &quot;you've got your arms in the legs of your breeches, and your legs in your shirtsleeves. And your boots on the wrong feet&quot; only to have Lionel reply pitifully, &quot;But they're the only feet I have now.&quot; Lionel's catty behavior among the humans also adds a bit of comic relief.<br />A very sweet little tale for fantasy buffs.o isn't afraid to let the guy she loves know when he's being an idiot.

All in a style very reminiscent of her sister. Can you trust a girlfriend not to tell her husband about the shoulder pad that wandered down your chest? Can you angrily confront a man in the office without sniveling? Can you get a boyfriend to pick up a container of Windex? How do you choose one of the four million \\"white\\" paint chips? And what can you do when the fifteen pairs of shoes JUST DON'T MATCH the dress for the Big Meeting?<br />The real-life relatives and significant others resemble characters in Cathy as well (one can see from where the cartoonist gets her inspiration): the obsessively thrifty, why-aren't-you-married-dear mother, the golf-obsessed boyfriend, the father who arrives at the airport six hours early, the married friends who whip out ten thousand ugly baby photos, the friend she eats lunch with, and so forth.<br />Amusing anecdotes (that probably wouldn't be allowed in a strip) include the woman who shrieked \\"I'M NOT WEARING UNDERWEAR!\\" in a crowded party, and the gal who had to call her mom for help when her merry widow got caught in her bedspread. These tales of romance, food, and humiliation will make you laugh, cry, then laugh a bit more.<br />Micky Guisewite has a hilarious style and plenty of emotional crises to unload. Well worth the read, and the reread! (Illustrated with little one-panel cartoons by Cathy Guisewite--also hilarious! They're worth the book alone...)	2001-08-15

Must Be Destroyed&quot; is an nice book, aptly describing events into the strange place we call &quot;Hollywood.&quot;<br />Put simply, it's about a young investment banker from Newww Yawk who comes to a Hollywood studio, and ends up winding his way through the bizarre ways of the people who work there.<br />The prose is a bit sparse, but is littered throughout with lines like &quot;Enough of me talking about me, why don't you talk about me for a while?&quot; In different settings it might be groanworthy, but in these circumstances it works pretty well. The cover looks a bit grainy, but has the pleasant view of Hollywood letters underscored by &quot;must be&quot; and then a fiery &quot;DESTROYED,&quot; as well as a rather stiff-looking guy in a suit, and a babe in a rather tight, small dress.<br />A nice book if you're in the mood for light and kinda lampoony.	2001-08-14

Padded with pseudo-intellectualism, every strained comparison and mythical nuance, it drones on for about 500 pages on topics that have very little to do with Harry Potter. If you don't take it seriously, it has a certain comedy value--because it DOES take itself seriously. Riddikulusly so.<br />The uneasy feeling began when I read &quot;NOT approved by JK Rowling&quot; on the cover, and was compounded when I read the introduction: &quot;Harry represents an archetypal hero who would have been as familiar to ancient Greeks as he is to modern suburbanites.&quot; (And I may be mistaken, but I thought the plural of kibbutz was kibbutzim. Editor, please?) It immediately launched into stuff about Harry Potter merchandise, fans, newspaper and movies. It also, rather sneeringly, goes over the people with concerns about Harry Potter comments, as well as lumping them all into &quot;conservative Christian&quot; category (which is inaccurate, as I've met Jews, Muslims, atheists who were anti-HP) and apparently dismissing their concerns.<br />The book is tiresome for a long while, engaging in media name-dropping and burbling about the various prestigious shows that JKR has been on and all the awards the books have won. The author also feels it necessary to go over the various words that might be too tough for the uneducated masses ( &quot;foreshadowing&quot;; &quot;Beatles&quot;; &quot;anomaly&quot;; &quot;Rolls Royce&quot;...) Oh, and there are spiky, unattractive pictures scattered through the book.<br />After about forty pages of such drivel, we finally get to the actual content on the books and characters. Unfortunately, the book is so bogged down by pseudo-intellectualism and the obsession with symbolism that any coherency (not to mention rationality) is rapidly lost. After a few pages of actually talking normally, the author felt it necessary to start off by explaining the significance of the names. Though some undoubtedly have meaning (&quot;Lupin,&quot; for one) they then degenerate into talking about how Hedwig inspires Harry, and theorizing that Crookshanks, rather than just being a bow-legged cat, is named after the fantasy illustrator George Cruikshanks.<br />We are also given material that will put any 9-12 student to sleep, as well as many adults. The book cheerfully gives us a geography lesson on the UK, and a long listing of seeming irrelevent Greek mythology. Then King Arthur, then fairy tales. These send the author into a new spin of babbling: &quot;Only the arrival of the Dementors [...] rouses him from his unconscious stupor, but ironically the Dementors' Kiss, an act in the normal world that represents warmth, causes the complete absence of a person's conscience as in the Kiss of Judas.&quot;<br />Other examples of pathetically strained thinking are: the connecting of Dudley's name with Dudlachd, the winter months of Scotland; the connecting of Celtic holidays with Hogwarts' Halloween party; respect of elders is equated with ancestor worship (WHAT?); Harry's infant swaddling of blankets is compared to Moses's basket (it stops just short of saying &quot;Harry is Christ!&quot;); and claiming that Dumbledore is similar to Merlin (somehow he strikes me as a watered-down Gandalf...).<br />I hate to offend anyone, but frankly NO BOOK ON EARTH has this much symbolism and interwoven meaning in it. Not even Lord of the Rings. The fact that the book was not approved by JK Rowling indicates that her thoughts and intents were never consulted. This person is simply loading what would be a slim volume with pseudo-intellectualism and a lot of babble, drawing from every source with even an imaginary connection to HP. (I can't imagine that when Rowling wrote of baby Harry in a bunch of blankets, she was thinking of Moses)<br />I give it one star for being entertaining.It's so ridiculously earnest that it comes across as comedic. It's silly, overworked and overburdened with information that does not have anything to do with its sources. So, read it for the comedic value and a good laugh or two. As a genuine work of &quot;exploration,&quot; it's a dismal flop.It's so ridiculously earnest that it comes across as comedic.

It took me a while to get past the first few chapters, but then the plot caught up speed into a magical, political story about love, revenge, music and memory.<br />A burned child with only vague memories of fire is brought to the bard's island of Luly, raised and marries there. Rook Caladrius and his wife have a son, Hollis, but the bards are slowly drifting from Luly to the mainland, Hollis among them. Caladrius stays where he is, until a young man named Griffin Tormalyne, one of the last of a great ruling house that was overthrown by the Basilisk, arrives seeking great power. Caladrius realizes that he cannot escape his shrouded past any longer, and sets off for the capitol city.<br />Elsewhere, the magister Giulia Dulcet spends divided time between the Tormalyne music school, and the taverns where she plays the single-stringed picochet. But soon she is called away to teach one of the Basilisk's daughters (he has two: smoldering sorceress Luna Pellior and the less intelligent, rather ignored Lady Damiet). She is aided by the mysterious Caladrius, who helps to teach Damiet how to play the picochet and how to sing. Damiet, who has previously thought mostly of clothing, begins to fall for Caladrius.<br />At the taverns where Giulia once sang, there is a growing rebellion against the Basilisk. Near the decayed husk of Tormalyne Palace, powerful political figures and wandering idealists band together for a political coup, with Hollis assisting them. But something exists that is far more powerful than mere troops: the magic that the Basilisk wields.<br />The heroes strike out against the sinister, aging despot and are caught in a clash of magic and music, between the dying symbol of an evil Basilisk and the last survivor of the Tormalyne family.<br />It's astonishing how real Patricia McKillip's dreamy books seem, but the political themes and the sad remnents of the proud Tormalyne family give it an added dimension of reality. As usual, her magic is not the slam-bang-whizz of most fantasy books, but an underlying whisper. You can feel it in the playing of the music, the island of Luly, the forest where Caladrius finds his flute, and the husk of the Tormalyne palace. And not everything happens pleasantly--not everything twists to the way it should be in an ideal world, and not every injustice or crime can be reversed. McKillip recognizes and acknowledges this.<br />Her characters are also very real. I particularly liked the composer Hexel, who spends half the book bewailing that he can't write without his muse and then scribbling furiously. Giulia Dulcet, Luna and Damiet are all excellently drawn: strong, intelligent Giulia, the powerful sorceress Luna who is far more than she seems to be, and the neglected Damiet who becomes so attached to the first person to treat her with real kindness. Because of his soul-scarred state, I found it a bit difficult to connect with Caladrius for a while, but once he got to the city things smoothed out a little. The Basilisk is a darker horse, though, as we don't really learn why he's so rotten. And Hollis and Justin are so sexy...<br />The first few chapters, with half of Rook's life passing on Luly, are a bit difficult to wade through but after that the plot picks up speed. Her writing style is, as always, beautiful and evocative; my favorite scene may be the part where the white basilisk appears, bit by bit, in each mirror in the hall, followed by the statues that Luna summons. This book is also tempered with a bit of humor that pops up sometimes (Damiet's assigning a dress to each song; Hexel asking rhetorically what lovers think of aside from love, and Giulia's reply, &quot;Clothes?&quot;)<br />All in all, a beautiful fantasy novel with a wonderful writing style and a spellbinding story.

This one is no exception, offering the dual info caches of ancient witch-burning and the complex gardens in England.<br />Heather Tradescant is an intelligent, rather too-blunt heroine who has always dreamed of going to England with her father. Though her father is now deceased, a hefty wad of insurance money now allows her to go. While she sightsees, she stumbled into a massive maze of hedges and plants, and soon stumbles into the eccentric Mr. Karim and his son Jordon. Karim is intrigued first by her name (explanation in the book) and then by her, and invites her to stay awhile.<br />Heather soon discovers that the local village is a bit obsessed with the famed Pendle Witches, a family group that was burned for witchcraft centuries before. She also meets a group of odd people: Jennet, a kindly but reticient woman who fits into the role of \\"village witch\\"; Lindsay, a shallow, manipulative woman with a Barbie-doll body; Giles, Lindsay's handsome and long-suffering hubby; Lindsay's monstrous son Bobby and tormented daughter.<br />Mystery-readers soon grow tired of the usual, boring, gorgeous and immensely attractive heroines (Jacqueline Kirby doesn't count--she's quirky). Heather is none of these: She's a bit overweight, enjoys her food immensely, is rather plain in appearance, but with a sharp intellect and bluntly truthful manner. I found it highly enjoyable that the men around her found her interesting, because of her brain rather than her body.<br />Frank Karim, despite his little bouts of maliciousness, is overall a fun character to read about, the weird millionaire. His son Jordon is a little less interesting, as often he seems to be rushed into his interest in Heather. Lindsay is despicable from her first scene, screeching at Lindsay then putting on a facade of neighborly sweetness; Giles is likable from his first scene. As Heather does, it takes a while to warm up to Jennet, as she is so reticient, but she is a strong and likable character as well.<br />I was very pleased that though this book contains Jennet and other Wiccans, it was not gratuitous. It's actually connected to the plot and the villain, and to the massive maze of bushes and hedges. Though I could have used a teeny bit less of Jennet's expounding on Wiccan philosophies, it overall didn't affect my enjoyment of the book. (And I just LOOOOOOOVE the descriptions of her shop and the exotic merchandise in it. What I wouldn't give to buy some of the jewelry and clothing from there...)<br />The descriptions are good; I particularly liked descriptions of the maze, the house, and the aforementioned shop of Jennet's. The mild obsession with the old witches was well-made, such as the murder mystery. The only problems were that it is a bit too actionless for a stretch in the middle, and the relationship between Heather and Jordon feels a bit forced compared to other novels by Ms. Michaels. However, the portrayal of the spoiled-rotten, maliciously-bratty Bobby is spot-on.<br />Overall, this is a good mystery and immensely entertaining, as well as informative.likable from his first scene.

Cherith Baldry does an admirable job of giving him a face and soul in this tense tale of betrayal and gashed honor.<br />The illegitimate son, Loholt, of King Arthur appears at the court of Camelot. With no heir, Arthur welcomes the younger man -- however, many are unwilling to accept him so readily. Among them is Arthur's foster brother and seneschal, Kay. Arthur ignores these suspicions.<br />When Loholt is suddenly murdered, Kay is suddenly the prime suspect for his death. He is no longer a knight at Camelot, but is cast out. He soon is forced to ally himself to a renegade warrior and his enchantress girlfriend, who are seeking to undermine the very highest levels of Camelot. Kay, not surprisingly, doesn't want this to happen, and must try to save his brother and kingdom from battle and magic.<br />I've had a bit of a soft spot for Kay since I read about him in &quot;The Sword in the Stone.&quot; A little blustery and show-offy, he nevertheless is shadowed too often by his foster-brother. In many works of fiction, Arthur and Kay don't even speak to each other very often, let alone continue any brotherly relationship.<br />It's refreshing to see Baldry's interpretation of Sir Kay, who is often portrayed as a bully, a buffoon, or a schemer. While he has imperfections in this telling, the character who grows over the course of the book is honorable and sympathetic, from the frame-up at the beginning to his determination to help Camelot and Arthur, even after being tossed out on his ear. The portrayals of the knights of the Round Table, other than Kay, are also interesting and multidimensional, as they often are not in other stories.<br />The majority of this tale takes place away from the usual castle of Camelot, and draws upon legends from pre-Malory eras. (Check up info on Loholt and other legends from the same period--it's worth the time and effort) The writing is compelling, accurately showing us what the characters are feeling, and describing the surroundings.<br />All in all, this is a classic tale that gives us new insight into a neglected character of Arthurian lore. An excellent addition to any Arthuriana-buff's collection.th the time and effort) The writing is compelling, accurately showing us what the characters are feeling, and describing the surroundings.<br />All in all, this is a classic tale that gives us new insight into a neglected character of Arthurian lore.

Then I got my hands on a copy of &quot;Dawnflight.&quot; Kim Headlee delves into history and humanity to produce a realistic (but not painfully so) story, something that you can envision actually happening.<br />The story centers around Pictish chieftainess Gyanhumara. When Roman forces defeat the armies of Caledonia (Scotland), Chieftain Ogryvan heads a general signing of a treaty with the Brydain lords - and among the conditions is that Gyanhumara must marry a Brydain noble.<br />The chief seeker of Gyanhumara's hand is Urien, who finds her attractive and is attractive somewhat himself. However, he is annoyed by the relatively emancipated manner of Gyanhumara, who is as comfy on the battlefield as in a hall full of ladies (more so, I thought). Gyanhumara is disgusted by his plans to tame her down, but in the interest of peace for her people, she agrees.<br />Then she meets Arthur, the Pendragon. With his questionable background, Arthur is not really acceptable as a potential husband for Gyanhumara, under the treaty. But the moment they meet, they love each other and, importantly, Arthur does not want to change Gyanhumara in any way. He intends to marry his beloved even if it causes conflicts -- but can she choose between her love and spirit, and the uncertain fate of her people?<br />Perhaps it's the author's excellent outlook toward Arthurian legend -- passing by religion, nationality, status, mythic background -- that causes her to do such a stellar job creating Gyanhumara as a strong, intelligent heroine. Her portrayals of the characters and politics of the time are excellent (as far as I can tell, I know virtually nothing about the clashes of the time) and the descriptions of fighting are easily-envisioned.<br />Too many supposedly strong heroines in Arthurian literature fail, becoming preachy and irritable. Gyanhumara thankfully doesn't fall into that trap, remaining a believable young woman who has simply been raised as an equal and excellent counterbalance to the strong men around her. I like the idea of Merlin's relationship to Arthur in this book, as I like Arthur himself. Too often, as Guinevere is seen as a slut, Arthur is seen as a wimp; fortunately, he's the young warlord he's expected to be.<br />Headlee's descriptions are more filled with metaphors than usual; &quot;No nectar was as sweet as the joy of winning&quot; is my personal favorite. The descriptiveness is slightly lower than I am used to in an Arthurian novel, but nevertheless it gets the images across.<br />Overall, this gains the label of &quot;classic,&quot; simply for being the one Guinevere novel that portrays her as a real person.

I've been reading a great deal of Arthurian lit currently, to help me focus for my own book, and this is one of the best I've read.<br />It takes place when a certain knight dies of poison during a party thrown by Queen Guinevere -- and the queen herself is the primary suspect. Sir Kay, being the lead character, dives in to help Guinevere and prove her innocent. (If you've never read the legend, then you doubtlessly won't know who the heck it is).<br />The characters are recognizable, but thankfully do not fully fall into the well-worn slots that many authors shift them into. Karr's portrayal of Kay was excellent, sympathetic and extremely accessible to the reader. I felt sorry for Guinevere, loved Karr's portrayal of Mordred (I'm seeing good Mordred portrayals left and right at present). On the flip side, Lancelot enthusiasts may want to run for the hills (are there Lancelot enthusiasts?).<br />Phyllis Ann Karr, aside from being a darn good Arthurian author/historian is also a darn good mystery author. She gets the pacing and interactions that are suitable in a good mystery, never becoming too extended and therefore, boring. The tone of the writing is wry and mildly humorous, though never Monty-Pythonesque. The cover is of the quiet, dignified type that many lower-key, higher-quality Arthurian books current have, with the sight of a castle fringed by green leaves.<br />Overall, this is what I think Elizabeth Peters would write if she wrote Arthurian lit. After the highly enjoyable &quot;Arthurian Companion&quot; (a must-read for Arthuriana buffs) this was a rare treat.	2001-07-25

I can, however, say that I found it profoundly uninteresting. (and here comes the flames)<br />The story opens in a large group of Highland deer, where a young warrior challenges Drail, Lord of the Herd, and is killed in the process. His mate, as he duels to the death with Drail's warriors, gives birth to a fawn with a white oak leaf on his forehead. To protect her son, who shows the marks of a legendary savior, she covers the leaf mark and gives him to another doe, whose fawn died.<br />Years pass, and Drail grows stronger. The baby, called Rannoch, is now a strong young thing - until the day when his oak leaf is glimpsed. The fawns and does flee the herd and head for parts unknown. Rannoch vanishes after an attack by some dogs, and years later returns. But he changes from a fiery young buck into a pacifistic young buck. And, if he is ever to fulfil his destiny, he must go back and confront Drail's sinister successor.<br />The book starts off with immense promise, introducing a unique deer society and power structure, such as the deer &quot;harems&quot; and the different tribes of deer with different views and customs. Rannoch starts off as a cute little thing, but with the kind of intelligence and courage that endears him to the reader instantly.<br />It starts to go downhill when he encounters humans. Unlike the classic tragic hero, Frodo, we get less and less insight into Rannoch's mind as the story progresses, and he begins to fight his destiny and become a pacifistic wimp. His weariness at the end is a literal shadow of Frodo's, as he seems to have accomplished less than simply walking in, taunting some other deer, and doing a lot of yapping.<br />The supporting characters (with the exception of the love interest) are far more interesting, such as the deer equivalent of the little outcast nerd who was teased constantly during recess (what a sweetie); also excellent are Rannoch's mother and foster-mother. The rotten Sgorr, sadly, is far more two-dimensional as we know WHY he's a creepy outcast, but not what his motivations are. We never are told why he was so warped as to do (spoiler deleted) in the first place.<br />The chapters leading up to the climax are pretty lifeless, with the deer grimly marching and Rannoch doing a lot of moping. It also kept emphasizing the comparisons to Christ and Moses; I actually rolled my eyes and laughed when Rannoch talks about &quot;take this burden from me.&quot; Please. The climax itself was kinda melodramatic, with the ravens and wolves and so forth (you'll know when you read it) and Rannoch talking constantly the whole while.<br />The writing style seemed to flip-flop between being stark and being nicely detailed. The first few pages set the tone nicely, with the descriptions of the Scottish Highlands and the area that the Herd lives in. The descriptions were also great when the does and fawns head off into the snowstorm.<br />Overall, it's a readable book that would have been great if Clement-Davies had dropped a fair portion of the mysticism, or at least spread it out evenly throughout the book (Bambi as Moses, eh?) and had kept the hero at least marginally interesting throughout the book. If you're a major fan of &quot;destiny&quot; heroes or anthropomorphic tales, you may want to check this out.

Tolkien was not the first or most critically-acclaimed fantasy writer, but he remains the most beloved and influential.<br /><br />The source of that influence: \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" the classic trilogy that quietly created the fantasy genre as we know it. It's a complicated, powerful story that stretches across a whole fantasy world, interwoven with tragedy and humour, and peopled with memorable characters.<br /><br />The quiet, good-natured hobbit Frodo Baggins has inherited a golden Ring that allows its user to become invisible. But his wizard friend Gandalf informs Frodo that the Ring is really the One Ring, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Sauron has poured his essence and power into. If Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth.<br /><br />So Frodo begins a perilous journey across Middle-Earth, accompanied by a fellowship of Men, Hobbits, Gandalf, an Elf and a Dwarf. Their destination is Mount Doom, the one place where the Ring can be destroyed.<br /><br />\\"The Two Towers\\" begins directly after \\"Fellowship,\\" after Frodo Baggins flees with his friend Sam into Mordor, with no one to protect them. His cousins Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by orcs from the renegade wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli begin a frenetic search for the hobbits, and receive unexpected help from unlikely allies. Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.<br /><br />\\"Return of the King\\" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.<br /><br />\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is a book that both draws on myth and inspires like a legend itself -- dark lords, kings-in-waiting, medieval fantasy worlds, elves and dwarves, and so forth. Almost every book that features any of those has drawn on Tolkien in some fashion, even if they're reacting against him.<br /><br />But the most powerful part of Tolkien's book is how it speaks right from the soul -- his love of language, mythology, the British country folk, his Catholic beliefs and peace. Though there are no direct linkages or lessons in the trilogy, Tolkien probably drew on his experiences in World War I for the ravaged battlefields and breakneck action sequences.<br /><br />And there is a streak of intense nobility through the story, fueling great courage and strength even in the most unlikely characters (Samwise Gamgee, a humble gardener). At the same time, Tolkien's characters walk the fine line of constant temptation by power, which can corrupt even the best people into becoming evil, hollow shells.<br /><br />Furthermore, Tolkien's prose has the same feeling of richness that his fantasy world does -- it feels slightly old-fashioned now, but it has a lot of raw power and beautiful descriptions (as well as some funny moments from Pippin). And he fills it with brilliantly iconic moments that stick in your memory, like Eowyn facing down the Witch-King.<br /><br />Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. At first it seems like he'll be a plucky hero in the mold of his uncle Bilbo, but he soon becomes a tragic figure who deteriorates under the Ring's influence. His only support comes from Sam, a solid, sensible gardener who is able to fend off the Ring's temptation.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is memorable as well -- the crabby grandfatherly Gandalf, the noble future king Aragorn, the perky sidekicks Merry and Pippin, the kindly Faramir, troubled warrior-woman Eowyn, and the repellent Saruman. Of particular note are the dwarf Gimli and elf Legolas,total opposites who become the best of friends (and have an orc-slaying contest!).<br /><br />Even after all the years, J.R.R.

An adult fairy-tale is hard to come by, but Sharon Shinn manages a beautiful one in rare style. It's hard to find the collection of magic, castles, princes and princesses, alongside a hard-hitting plot and strong characters; however, this book fulfils them.<br />Coriel is the ... daughter of a nobleman and a wise woman (who seduced him with magic) who spends nine months out of every year with her healer grandmother, learning how to be a wise woman as well. But every summer she travels to beautiful Castle Auburn, to be with her uncle Jaxom and lovely half-sister Elisandra. She rapidly falls in crush with the handsome Prince Bryan, unable to yet see what a self-absorbed bratling he is.<br />A few years pass, and as Cory ages and matures, she sees that all is not sweet and peaceful at Castle Auburn. The elven aliora (who are sweet, gentle, kind, etc) are enslaved by the noblemen as servants, tied to the human world rather than their unspeakably beautiful otherworld. And Bryan is not the wonderful prince she was infatuated with &#8212; he is cruel, irresponsible, narcissistic, arrogant, and sires at least one illegitimate baby over the course of the book.<br />Surrounding Bryan are more mature noblemen who don't want to be ruled by a brat prince, but are not ready to do anything. Jaxom takes sudden and unexpected actions. Elisandra must choose between happiness and duty, and Cory must consult her heart and morals after Bryan takes horrifying action against an aliora servant. Love, death, treachery and political intrigue lace the beautiful prose and entrancing background of \\"Castle Auburn.\\"<br />I liked Coriel. Rarely do books have genuinely human heroines, and her overwrought teen thoughts (such as her melodramatic statement when Bryan kisses her forehead) are in tune with infatuation. However, I felt her awakening to the aliora's plight was a bit too quick, and her siding with them a bit too complete (her willingness to see Jaxom as a monster, etc). I wish Jaxom had been a bit more explored, given the mysterious actions going on. Elisandra's rigid road of duty -- and the results -- were pretty emotionally jerky but made sense later on.<br />Though billed as an adult fantasy, this is perfectly all right to let a teen read. There is some tasteful discussion of sex (in terms of illegitimate offspring and a wedding), not much violence, and no profanity worse than \\"damn.\\" There is some talk of suicide/murder and moral debates on enslavement, however.<br />Nevertheless, flaws or not, this book has a magical atmosphere that is worthy of an aliora.een a bit more explored, given the mysterious actions going on.

The author and accompanying media seem to imply that if you dislike this book, you are clinging to a pro-slavery fictional South portrayed in &quot;Gone with the Wind,&quot; that you are being stodgy and unwilling to face facts.<br />Can I dislike this book just because it was really bad?<br />Sadly, this volume was not worth the highly-publicized legal battle that was waged over it. Though described as an unauthorized parody from the African-American POV of the time, this book is an utter failure. (Did I mention the title is also pretty bad?)<br />The book centers on the mulatto half-sister of GWTW lead Scarlett O'Hara, Cynara. Cynara is the daughter of Captain O'Hara (&quot;Planter&quot;) and Mammy, Scarlett's strong-minded, down-to-earth nursemaid. &quot;The Wind Done Gone&quot; chronicles Cynara's life in Tara and in the post-Civil War Reconstruction, where she is raised alongside her glamorous half-sister but denied the same love, attention and privileges. Then &quot;Planter&quot; sells her, and she ends up in a brothel. Ironically, one frequenter of the brothel is Rhett Butler, the dashing handsome husband of Scarlett (who is constantly--and irritatingly--referred to as &quot;Other&quot;). She becomes his long-term lover, and naturally we are supposed to sympathize with Cynara and not with &quot;Other...&quot;<br />Where to begin?<br />Despite the red sticker on the cover, this is not a parody: a parody indicates humor or satire, of which this book has neither. It's too relentlessly self-conscious of Its Mission to be truly amusing, and too heavy-handed to be a successful satire. (Here's hoping that someone with the witty style of Dave Barry tries a satire of GWTW) The writing style is, like many pieces of literary fiction, rambling and present-tense, sometimes lapsing into stream of consciousness.<br />As a main character, Cynara fails. While &quot;Other&quot; is decidedly unlikeable in the original work, she has the rare quality of fascination that draws the reader in and makes them read about a character whether they like him/her or not. Sadly, Ms. Randall does not have the capability to do this with her characters; I felt that Cynara's only function in the story was to compare her to &quot;Other.&quot; When Cynara got involved with dashing, handsome, virile Rhett Butler (&quot;R&quot;) I began to wonder if Cynara was Randall's alter ego. She's annoying contemporary, as well as being delightfully PC; also, I saw little maturing and learning in her thoughts, as well as little of the touted intelligence that she is supposed to have.<br />Cynara, in fact, spends so much time comparing herself to &quot;Other&quot; that I found the description of &quot;independent-minded woman&quot; irrelevent. She frets constantly about Other's prettiness, her glamor, her relationship with &quot;R&quot;--and it rapidly becomes childish and tiresome.<br />And though this was touted as a viewpoint from the slaves, I was appalled to see how they were portrayed. This book gave Randall an opportunity to portray the slaves as being oppressed and maltreated, yet retaining inner dignity and will. Rather, she had them violent and aggressive toward others, including the infant sons of &quot;Planter&quot; (chop it down to simple terms &quot;they were killing innocent babies&quot; and it doesn't sound so fair, does it?). I was shocked. REALLY SHOCKED. Like &quot;St. Louis&quot; I was rather disgusted that the worst part of slavery was gleefully twisted around, thus negating its very horror.<br />I can only imagine why Ms. Randall was so determined that TWDG be a parody of GWTW -- either a deep-seated psychological fixation, or a determination to boost her first book sales. But I do know that had she not been so relentless in her pursuit of making this so-called parody, she could have produced an excellent novel. If you could strip away the preoccupation with GWTW, Scarlett O'Hara, and the PC-ness of it all she could have written a decent novel. (Minus the infanticide mentioned in the previous paragraph, of course)<br />Quite honestly, I'd have welcomed a witty parody of GWTW that could pointedly show the plight of the slaves and lampoon the &quot;gallant South&quot; (it is admittedly fun to read about). Sadly we'll have to wait for someone else to do so.s the infanticide mentioned in the previous paragraph, of course)<br />Quite honestly, I'd have welcomed a witty parody of GWTW that could pointedly show the plight of the slaves and lampoon the &quot;gallant South&quot; (it is admittedly fun to read about).

Though she was originally from New England, she made the Crescent City her home and inspiration.<br /><br />So it's no surprise that \\"Dinner at Antoine's\\" drips with the sensual richness of that city in the last days before World War II. It's half murder mystery, half soap opera -- a murder is the complicating action of the plot, but it's got lots of affairs, lies, secrets and other fun things. The one thing that galls is... well, this was written in the late forties, so the racial aspects will make modern skins crawl.<br /><br />Playboy Orson Foxworth introduces his niece Ruth to the rich'n'famous denizens of New Orleans -- especially beautiful Amelie Lalande, a self-absorbed widow whom Foxworth wants as a lover, but is willing to marry. Amelie's family is a burgeoning soap opera -- her elder daughter Odile is desperately trying to hide a debilitating disease, while younger daughter Caresse is on the verge of an affair with Odile's sleazy husband Leonce.<br /><br />Then Odile spills wine on herself and rushes out of Antoine's, hysterical. And Amelie rejects Foxworth's proposal -- since Odile is so sick, she can't leave her poor invalid daughter alone.<br /><br />Except Odile is then found in her bedroom. She's been drugged and shot through the heart with a pistol that was given to her by an ex-lover. Was it her selfish mother? Her jealous sister? The sleazy cheating husband who wanted to be rid of her? Her devoted mammy? The ex-lover who still passionately loves her? The lives of everyone around Odile are irrevocably changed before the person who killed her is revealed.<br /><br />\\"Dinner At Antoine's\\" is in some way a love letter to New Orleans -- luxurious restaurants, beautiful clothes, passionate romance and some moderate decadence. Little shreds of New England prudery pop up every now and then, but Keyes' love for New Orleans shines out of every scene, whether it's the graveyards or the wild dancing at nightclubs.<br /><br />And she crafts a pretty decent murder mystery, deftly juggling the police investigation with the soap-opera antics of some of the characters. There are a lot of passionate declarations of love, false accusations, broken engagements and other fun antics -- not to mention the luxuriant descriptions of houses, restaurants and clothing. But she ties off all the plot threads and clues neatly, in a way that doesn't seem too far-fetched, but is still baffling before you know what happened.<br /><br />At first it seems like Ruth will be the protagonist, since she's a smart, independent young woman who is also an outsider to the group of suspects -- in fact, she's almost the only one with no motive at all. But it turns out to be more of an ensemble piece, with the perspective floating between Caresse, Foxworth, reporter Joe Racina and various other characters. Most irritating: Amelie Lalande, an aging ingenue who floats around in a cloud of pseudo-pious artificiality.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there's an uncomfortable problem with \\"Dinner At Antoine's\\" -- while Keyes' depiction of African-Americans was probably pretty sensitive in 1947, it comes across as unintentionally racist today. The whole mammy thing is particularly awkward, but to Keyes' credit, she depicts Tossie as a warm and strong-willed person.<br /><br />If you can look past the dated aspects of the narrative, \\"Dinner at Antoine's\\" is a delicious little novel that straddles the line between murder mystery and love letter to New Orleans.

Few strips can achieve -- or surpass -- the surreality of Calvin and Hobbes, and this is one of those few. (&quot;Liberty Meadows&quot; is another, sadly not in books yet...)<br />It features doofus, perpetually human-hungry shark Sherman; irritable wife Megan (don't cross her if you value your life); Fillmore the nerdy and cultured sea turtle; Hawthorne the malicious and loudmouthed little hermit crab; and recurring character Ernest, sarcastic and geeky little fish.<br />Among the crazy adventures are: Bill Gates buys the island, Megan thinks she's pregnant, Fillmore actually gets a date (something is wrong, of course), the return of irritating Thornton the warm-weather polar bear, Hawthorne's annual shell-changing--and of course, lots of Sherman-chases-beach-apes-aka-humans and Hawthorne-pinches-beach-ape-toes!<br />The pop culture references in the isolated tropical island make a bizarre combo (Starbucks, for example) and the sight of a shark at a computer should theoretically be strained and overdone. However, given the colorful personalities and kooky situations at Kapupu Island, even sea boogers will find this entertaining in Toomey's skilled and skewed imagination!	2001-07-06

Karen has just been dumped by her husband of ten years, who is marrying his svelte, efficient, pretty teenage secretary. Karen, who is twenty nine, somewhat overweight, and has been stuck in a doormat routine for many  years, feels ashamed to meet the friends (and former boyfriends) who are still in Georgetown. She tries to avoid her old boyfriend Mark (who warned her against marrying her husband), but ends up befriending his sister Cheryl.<br />She takes a small job looking after a friend's antique shop, but soon becomes sucked into the world of vintage clothing. A distant relative allows her to purchase an assortment of old valuable dresses, and soon old ladies are selling their dresses, veils, and slips to Karen. Soon she and Cheryl are starting their own business, with some very rare items. Additionally, Mark and a handsome cop are both becoming quite attentive.<br />But someone is after an item among Karen's newly-bought things. One of the crumpled old dresses hides more than mold and dust, a secret that someone is willing to kill to keep hidden.<br />This book is enjoyable on levels other than just a ripping good murder mystery. It also shows Karen's evolution from a dull housewife with low self-esteem and a stagnant marriage, to an independent woman with newly-found courage and a rising business. Her relationship with her husband starkly contrasts with Mark's, as one is mindless and unemotional and the other is smart and respectful. It can also be seen as Karen's evolution into a more assured person, as she learns to &quot;fight back.&quot;<br />Karen and Cheryl are excellent foils for each other, with enough similarities to make then sisters in all but blood, but different enough that they are not redundant. Mark  is vintage Elizabeth Peters/Barbara Michaels: Funny, sweet, sexy, attractive, with just enough crabbiness to make him real. There are also the two socialites, snotty Shreve and dead-eyed Miriam. A couple of creepy widows.

Jo's sister Mary just had a third miscarriage, and the loss of her baby is affecting her mentally - she's clinging to the idea of a child out in the woods, who is crying for her and begging for her help. Jo begins to wonder if Mary really is crazy -- but then she hears the crying too.<br />Jo teams up with her brother in law Ran, and the handsome (but woman-wary) doctor Will Graham, to find out what the crying is. But when the ghostly apparition of a  beautiful, sad woman appears, Jo begins to dig into the past of Ran's family, and discovers a web of lies, murder, and terror centering on a lost child...<br />Quite honestly I had difficulty sleeping after reading this novel -- the climax is intense and terrifying, as is the revelation of who committed those murders. There were plenty of suspects, but at the same time no one would suspect the guilty party.<br />Jo is an excellent heroine: smart, wry, brave, and loyal to her sister, who is a rather nebulous presence once it's discovered that, while unstable, she's not totally delusional. I thought Ran was something of a controlling fink, but he was very human in his flaws and strong points (loves his wife, wants a child, etc). I disliked Will initially, because of his rather hostile stance toward women, but began to warm to him as the novel progressed.<br />A delightful ghost story/mystery.

Though it lacks the wry humor of some of her books, it nevertheless has a nice storyline and some truly spinechilling moments.<br />A young writer named Michael Collins (I wonder, did Ms. Michaels deliberately give this guy the same name as the Irish rebel? Or a coincidence?) arrives as the home or wealthy intelligent philanthropist millionaire Randolph. Collins is immediately attracted to Randolph's beautiful younger wife Linda, but can't help noticing that Linda is dulling her pain with alcohol, seems to be both hateful toward her husband and terrified of something she can't name. The sight of large dogs, for example, throws her into fainting fits.<br />Collins also senses something strange and sinister about Randolph, despite the latter's charming and hearty manner. He checks into the backgrounds of people who knew Randolph before he married his wife, and finds disturbing but nebulous results. Then Linda, whom her husband claims is insane, runs away and keeps running, with a bizarre old witch as her only solid ally. But Linda has a counter-claim about Randolph, that  implies something far darker and more horrifying than mere insanity.<br />This book has amazing atmosphere, especially in the first chapter where Linda is clearly terrified and emotionally threadbare, but there is no sign as to why. The creepiness pervades virtually every scene with and about Randolph. Collins himself is a nice, sympathetic character with a great balance of sensitivity and &quot;macho&quot;; as for Linda, it's a little difficult to determine whether she's correct, insane, or a bit of both. As for Randolph--he WILL give you goosebumps.<br />The book is hardly flawless - Ms. Michaels's brilliant humor is often missing (though I loved Collins' buddy coming in and finding Linda tied down to the bed); there is a  large &quot;dead&quot; section in the middle of the book where the characters do little but talk; also, the ending seems to be a bit rushed and hastily written.

But this book hadn't DuMaurier's other books' sparkling prose and intense dialogue, or any of the spinetingling atmosphere that sucks you in.<br />It also wasn't helped by the fact that the main characters ARE parasites, living off whoever they are nearby. Their whininess and complaints augmented their selfish personas. I spent much of the book wanting to slap them. There don't really seem to be ANY likeable characters, and while I didn't expect the ending, I felt even more depressed when I read what one of the characters did.<br />I advise you to read &quot;Rebecca&quot; or &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; for a first book.

It's an interesting tale of Timothy Hunter, perhaps the greatest magician of all time, the illegitimate son of Tam Lin and Queen Titania of the Faeries.<br />Tim lives as an ordinary boy in our world, with a sloppy but loving father, and a few rather unworldly acquaintances. His father, Tam Lin, occasionally pops up in human form as does the Amadan, a rather repulsive little sprite who  waits on Queen Titania. The Queen herself is furious because the Faerie lands are dying, for reasons that no one knows.<br />Tim has problems of his own when he ventures into the lair of a mysterious - and sinister - creature. This will lead to the discovery of what is killing the  Faerie lands, and exact a terrible price in return.<br />While I found the story tight-paced and enjoyable, I wished they'd give us a little more backstory as to how Tim knows who his true father is. It would've made Titania's comments in the garden a little easier to understand (&quot;we made love and a child in this garden&quot;). I also felt that the explanation for the dying Faerie lands was a little too pat.<br />The artwork was pretty bad - often it shifted from one frame to another,  becoming well-defined in one frame and blurry in another. Dimensions altered. And Titania was terribly drawn - she's supposed to be beautiful, darnit! It looks like they simply took a picture of a none-too-pretty woman and colored her green (not to mention the fact that her teeth often appear the same  color as her skin). She looks much better in future books.<br />However, the atmosphere is unparalleled. The clash with the Manticore was  downright chilling, as was the effects on Tim. I was quite surprised by Death's arrival, you'll be surprised at the face and personality of &quot;death.&quot; And the  last few pages were both sweet and sad.<br />A nice comic book, hardly flawless but nor is it bad.	2001-06-17

I found the initial first pages  confusing, but the pages following that caught me up.<br />The story begins amid the ending panels of &quot;Summonings&quot;, then proceeds back in time several centuries to a tiny girl named Rose, who stumbles into the Queen of the Faerie. Rosebud quickly becomes a favorite of the Queen - and as she grows  into adulthood, is also a &quot;favorite&quot; of the King (if you take my meaning). When  Queen Dymphna mysteriously vanishes, the King marries Rosebud - who takes  on the name of Titania. (Starting to sound familiar?) The new queen also sort of  morphs into a fairy.<br />More familiar characters resurface as the king dies, and his nephew Auberon takes over the throne and marries the queen. But during a venture to Earth, Titania meets and falls in love with a man named Tam Lin. Her love affair with him is cut short when she becomes pregnant and gives birth to an apparently-human baby, who vanishes along with a nursemaid. Thus starts the life of Timothy Hunter...<br />Even if you're not familiar with the Books of Magic, this is diverting and entertaining, especially if you know about the legend of Tam Lin. The artwork is so so--often it  looks like the artist put a sketch instead of a finished panel (like when Dymphna cries out &quot;My torque!&quot;) and Titania's facial shape sometimes looks plain silly.<br />Overall, a very enjoyable comic. I also recommend the sequel, &quot;Auberon's Tale&quot; (tell me, am I alone in finding him VERY sexy?)	2001-06-17

Dulcinea must use flute magic (better description in the book) to rescue peole from a dragon, who was conjured by the evil Society of Mages. When Dulcinea's father realizes that Raz is a talented, skilled mage, he acidently involves himself and his daughter in a power battle that risks the entire world. All standing between them and possible chaos is three magicians, including heroine Dulcinea...<br />I'll admit it. I'm a sucker for stories about magicians and people discovering new powers, such books as Diana Wynne Jones, TA Barron, and Jane Yolen's &quot;Wizard Hall.&quot; I was not disappointed by &quot;Dulcinea,&quot; and I doubt other wizard-fans will as well. (I especially liked the concept of flute magic...)<br />Dulcinea is a very cool heroine in a genre where too often the heroines are Buffy-types or weenies. She manages to be precisely what is expected in this situation -- a teenage girl who ends up in a power struggle with the Society, and who grows in personality throughout the book. Her changing relationships with her father and Raz were genuinely intriguing. Raz and Dulcinea's dad are equally realistic as their perceptions change (and I honestly did not know for a while what was up with Raz)<br />This is not a dumbed-down book in style (one paragraph contains &quot;apex&quot; and &quot;inanimate&quot;). It's very descriptive and the author does not skimp on complexity or unique ideas. Such creatures as dragons and wizards are given new spins in this book. (My only quibble would be that in tense situations, a little too much notice is paid to details, but that's a small one)<br />Definitely a five-star book. Fans of Harry Potter or Diana Wynne Jones would love this magical tale.and wizards are given new spins in this book.

This is one of the latter, and displays that Ms. Michaels is also an intelligent literary person (and that Nate Hawthorne was a nauseating chauvinist)<br />English professor Karen Holloway once found a privately printed book of poetry from the eighteenth/nineteenth century, by &quot;Ismene.&quot; After the poetry becomes a roaring success, she is summoned by a friend named Simon, who shows her a battered old manuscript -- also by Ismene. Karen is desperate to have the Gothic thriller, which follows the beautiful Ismene and her empty-headed sister Clara as they arrive at their cousin's enormous mansion. A brooding doctor, stormy weather, hidden house and a ghastly figure complete the Gothic sense.<br />Karen encounters a little drama of her own -- due to the success of Ismene's poetry, a bunch of other writers are trying to get their hands on the manuscript. The locals are acting more than a little odd also, either unhelpful or deliberately searching...<br />And as Karen deciphers the old story, she begins to wonder about it. Is it just a story that the talented Ismene created, or is it a memoir of terror and deception from long ago? Ismene's unfinished manuscript and a haunting line of poetry may hold the key.<br />Though the label &quot;feminist&quot; on Karen may turn off some readers, she's not really a feminazi -- rather, she has to deal with the very real sexism of her male colleagues, who scorn such authors as Jane Austen and George Eliot. (And it's shown that this is not new -- each chapter opens with a quote about women and literature, such as the pig Nathaniel Hawthorne's suggestion that women who write should have &quot;their faces deepley scarified with an oyster shell.&quot;) Her colleagues don't have a problem with the money Ismene's novel would give them, though. Karen's feminism is fairly low-key, though there is one hilarious scene where she deliberately makes a shocking speech to isolated small-townsfolk. I liked how she found a kindred spirit in the long-dead Ismene, who was a fierce feminist and abolitionist of the times.<br />Supporting characters are even more sparkling. Tough-on-the-outside, marshmallowy-on-the-inside Peggy holds Karen up throughout her adventure, and charming old-world Simon is a delight. Bill Meyer, on the other hand, will honestly leave you wondering whether to sympathize or not.<br />Someone who has read extensive Elizabeth Peters/Barbara Michaels books will know of her particular faves, such as Louisa May Alcott and the Brontes. Comparisons are made to Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights, going over such now-cliche items as the Tall Dark Brooding Man, the Frightened Heroine, the Big House/Castle on the Cliff/Moors, the Dark Secret, and so forth. Ms. Michaels utilizes these herself (well, not the Frightened Heroine.... Nervous Heroine would be better) with wry twists and observations about their appropriate nature.<br />A particularly enjoyable note is that portions of Ismene's book are interspersed. They have appropriately overdescriptive prose and hyperdramatic dialogue (both staples of the times) and are very evocative in emotions and imagination. The only problem is that the ending is quite rushed and becomes a bit incomprehensible, especially as characters only briefly referred to suddenly seem pivotal. There is, fortunately, a geneological map at the beginning, so be sure to look there.<br />This book is a gem, both for fans of mystery and of Gothic lit. &quot;Houses of Stone&quot; does for Gothic novels what &quot;Die For Love&quot; did for romance!though there is one hilarious scene where she deliberately makes a shocking speech to isolated small-townsfolk.

Such books as &quot;The Crying Child,&quot; &quot;Shattered Silk,&quot; and &quot;Houses of Stone&quot; have kept me reading wide-eyed long into the night. This book didn't really have that quality (and normally I love books set in Italy) like the dismal &quot;Here I Stay,&quot; which I was unable to FINISH.<br />Heroine Kathy Malone, recovering from a stay in a loony bin following the death of her husband Bart, is travelling to Italy to tell his formidable grandmother of his death. Through a rather bizarre event, the grandmother comes to believe that Kathy is pregnant with Bart's child, and insists on keeping her there in royal treatment. Kathy gets a boyfriend or two, and befriends a ten-year-old relation named Pietro who is reportedly insane - and then discovers a sinister web of deception and death, that ensnares her and Pietro both.<br />I wish there were more plot to describe without giving away the ending, but sadly there isn't. This book would have made a better short story. There is too much time spent on Kathy rambling around the Italian village and lying to the Contessa and worrying about not being pregnant and insisting that Pietro is sane. There was nothing particularly endearing or enlightening about Kathy, or indeed about any of the characters. The Contessa is the most engaging person in the book, yet even she is not particularly interesting to the reader.<br />Michaels is also a master of witty prose/dialogue and romantic suspense, but neither is in this book. The best humor is some heavy-handed stuff about Kathy's childhood nickname, and the romance consists of Kathy conversing (I can't say flirting) with some local guys, all of whom have as little personality as she.<br />Quite a few sections should have been edited (if Bart was such a fink, why did Kathy continue to have erotic dreams about him?) or explained in more detail (the housekeeper's actions at the end). Even the writing style is rather dry and unexplanatory. The pace is uneven -- the book dribbles along for the first three quarters, then rushes the rest of the way.<br />I can only assume that Ms. Michaels was having a bad time during the writing of this book, and then go back to &quot;Houses.&quot;ore detail (the housekeeper's actions at the end).

One of them, Orion, is haunted by sinister, disturbing dreams, in which a brilliant light is being shone down and parents are unable to hear cries for help...<br />Orion and Maya soon discover strange artifacts buried inside a cave. What are they? What does this mean to them? They are not normal archaeological finds, as they portend a massive and disturbing discovery for the kids....<br />This is a nice SF read, which poses some absorbing questions as the plotm goes along. Writing is evocative and descriptive, especially for descriptions of landscapes and surroundings. All is suitably otherworldly without being bizarrely so.<br />Atmosphere is handed EXTREMELY well in this novel; the beginning dream, with its aura of loneliness and powerlessness, is enough to send chills down the spine. Another scene I found immensely powerful was the &quot;quest&quot; in the desert, when Maya encounters a dead friend of hers. Richner's use of language effectively makes the reader see and feel these events. Occasionally the pace becomes uneven, though characterizations are strong and well-made.<br />A very enjoyable SF novel! Very recommended.	2001-06-08

Similarly, there is something innately likeable about the book itself, with the good descriptions and intriguing plot. (Cosmetics queen seeks immortality? Why didn't *I* think of that?)<br />I'd say the best term would be &quot;everymouse,&quot; with unrequited love, pleasant thank-you notes to the world, a pet ladybug he calls Terfle (also the name of the publishing company), and a job repairing clocks. Not an exciting life, but neither is it an unpleasant one.<br />The object of his affection is Linka Perflinger, a pilot who at one point comes in to have her watch repaired. She vanishes, and soon a rather repulsive rat comes in to pick up her watch. Hermux follows him to Linka's home, and soon realizes that she may have been kidnapped. A journal from the jungle of Teulabonari gives him a clue to where Linka may be, and he soon finds himself facing down a cosmetics monarch, a plastic surgeon, and an army of lab rats...<br />It's hard not to like Hermux, the humble and mild-natured mouse who finds himself roped into becoming an amateur detective (for Linka's sake). His... zest isn't quite the word, &quot;enjoyment&quot; of life is a nice oasis in a massive number of sarcastic and/or world-weary heroes. His conversations with Terfle and thanks to the universe are really sweet.<br />Fans of Harry Potter may enjoy the twisty, edge-of-your-seat storylines, while fans of Redwall may enjoy the intelligently-portrayed talking mice. A particularly nice touch is the names: rather than insulting our intelligence with fake &quot;mouse-y&quot; names, Hoeye creates unique names like &quot;Hermux Tantamoq&quot; or &quot;Teulabonari&quot; which add just the right note of fantasy.<br />I am definitely anticipating the publication of the second Hermux book....	2001-06-08

What if you were given the CHOICE? It's a good question that is raised pretty well in this particular book...<br />Lindsay, the main character, suffers along the same lines as many literary high school students. The way to avoid being squished is to stay out of the way. But when she is roped into a school production of Arthuriana, she is suddenly transported to the REAL Camelot. And the question is raised: would you rather be a downtrodden sophomore, or a far more respected person in the glorious court of King Arthur?<br />It's a good question, handled fairly well, though I would've preferred a little more depth in the handling. Lindsey is a sympathetic character with understandable worries and responses to things that happen to her, both past and present. The writing style is a trifle bare, and often I felt that I didn't have enough insight into what was going on there.<br />All in all, a nice time-travel read and nice Arthurian read.	2001-06-04

It does, however, suffer a little from sequelitis. There are some uneven parts, but this is a very good fantasy!<br />Claidi's wedding day is disrupted when guards from Wolf Tower abduct her (that'll spoil any bride's day). She is transported across a body of water to a small house near an enormous palace. She is shown into the palace, which is a self-made maze that continuously shifts. Additionally, the strange Wolf Star rises over the palace all the time.<br />Soon she befriends Prince Venn, the occupant of the palace, who doesn't particularly want her there either. She gains both his trust and cooperation, but must consider seriously her misty past and equally questioning future.<br />Claidi is still the same feisty heroine as in Wolf Tower, though I thought the slightly more introspective tone in this book made her seem more mature. Venn was an interesting character, though I thought he lost some of the sparkle partway through.<br />An extra star for originality! The mechanical rooms that forever shift and alter the layout of the palace is a bizarre, dreamlike stroke of genius, and added a touch of oddity to the growing trust between Claidi and Venn. The writing style to describe these is excellent, especially when describing the Wolf Star and Venn's palace.<br />A good read, especially if you read the previous book. Here is hoping for more Claidi.	2001-06-03

All right, his humor shines through in his many quirky spinechillers, but I had no idea he had written something like this.<br />&quot;The Pedant and the Shuffly&quot; is a cool enough title on its own, but it frames a very unusual and witty short fantasy. The premise is simple: Snodrog (don't laugh) an evil magician, uses cold logic to entrap and transform his victims into Flimsies (don't laugh).  But soon, Wodehousian-named Sir Bertram Crabtree-Gore, a good magician, teams up with a Shuffly (don't laugh), and Snodrog soon has a worthy opponent(s)...<br />Bellairs' starkly descriptive prose is as good in this book as it is in his famed chillers and &quot;Face in the Frost.&quot; Though this book is unusually short (about half the regular for his books) and relatively simple in plot, it is laced with witty satire in logic and Latin.<br />Kids will enjoy the cute plot. Adults will enjoy the witty undertones. Both will enjoy &quot;Pedant and the Shuffly&quot;!	2001-06-03

This is a highly enjoyable fantasy with snappy dialogue and characters and a well-paced, original plot.<br />It takes place on the lovely island kingdom of Pandium, where magic is an art like painting or music, that the gifted can master. The characters we are introduced to are Kyp and Edwin. Edwin is the Crown Prince of Pandium, scheduled to become king on his twelth birthday, while Kyp is an apprentice to the Royal Magician Krisgen. Not much of an apprentice, though - his treatment is subtlely illustrated when the author tells us, &quot;He hadn't owned a pair of shoes or boots since Krisgen had taken him as an apprentice.&quot;<br />But apparently Krisgen isn't inclined to let Edwin become king. Kyp overhears his plotting and tells his friend. The two boys utilize Kyp's untutored magic and a borrowed spell book to conjure a hero who can bash down the conspiracy against the future king.<br />Who arrives? A pair of ordinary kids from Florida, Nat and Katie. Together, the four kids have to defeat Krisgen and his allies before Katie and Nat can be returned to their own world...<br />I found this book while browsing the publisher's website, and got a copy as soon as possible. It proved to be a well-done book in the manner of Lloyd Alexander's &quot;The Arkadians,&quot; with a bit of world-crossing thrown in. I found the characters to be engaging and endearing, especially Kyp and Edwin, who actually act like preteen boys (a rarity in most books). Katie and Nat were also engaging, though I found them a little less so than the Pandian heroes.<br />Like the book &quot;Dulcinea,&quot; the writing style is not dumbed down or deliberately made stark. Though a little less descriptive in parts than I would like, the book doesn't skimp on describing the heroes or the objects they focus on (settings are less well-defined). There were definitely some mild awkward passages, like &quot;the cow's blood sizzled and smelled terrible as it hit the hot metal&quot; but these are relatively few and far between.<br />Overall, this is a magical and well-written fantasy. I hope that TA Clark has more in mind...elled terrible as it hit the hot metal&quot; but these are relatively few and far between.<br />Overall, this is a magical and well-written fantasy.

This book gives us a good insight into how people would have felt and seen things.<br />The war between Greece and Troy has been lasting years, and Troy is beginning to crumble under relentless pressure to win back the beautiful Helen.<br />The characters we know already, Paris and Helen and Hector and so forth, are shown from the viewpoints of servant girls, who have a tangle of loves and infatuations worthy of a high school soap. Marpessa is Helen's servant, and her sister Xanthe is Hector's son's nurse. Their anguishes and loves spin their courses as Troy collapses ever further, a situation including the famed wooden horse.<br />The gods appear, as they do in myth and legend, but only in brief spurts -- the humans are the ones we wish to see here. And it is these unknowns, the invented people that interest us for anyone with a passing knowledge of the Iliad will know the conclusion for Troy, for Paris, for Helen. But we don't know what will happen to Marpessa and Xanthe, and thus we care a great deal.<br />Marpessa and Xanthe are interesting characters, but I often felt that the focus shifted a little too far off them. That, and I got bored easily by the kitchen gossip &#8212; it was entertaining for a bit but got a little older later on. I also tended to get a little lost in the tangle of who-loves-who, where A loved B who is secretly in love with C, who got A pregnant.<br />One inevitable thing is that the writing style will be a bit off when one adapts a novel from an ancient poem. Often it seemed to sag or to lose something that could have made a scene sparkle. It was fairly sprightly throughout most of the book, but I felt that it was a bit \\"off\\" when the major events of the legend came together at the finale.<br />Overall, an enjoyable adaptation with a few awkward spots, but a nice read.	2001-06-03

As a result, the eldest witch and Macbeth become trapped within a mirror, only to have the hag escape almost a millennium later.<br />Teenage Kinny O'Neil has a summer job at a Canadian Stratford's theater, helping with the production of &quot;Macbeth.&quot; But a supposed curse on MacBeth plays (check the Idiot's Guide to Shakespeare--there have been a lot of misfortunes) seems to be coming true via a series of sinister occurrances, that involve the hand mirror. And the witch, who wants to gain a girl's body, is targeting Our Heroine.<br />Kinny and Lucas can see Macbeth in the hand mirror, thus prompting them into investigating the sinister magics of the three witches. The journey to stop the witches from unleashing their evil will take wits and brains - and a voyage to Scotland, the place where it all started...<br />A great chiller, full of atmosphere and creepiness in the forms of the three witches and their sorcery. Katz weaves a spellbinding aura around the book, such as the opening chapter and the scenes where Macbeth can be glimpsed in the mirror -- and the climax, of course. We are also given more grounded visions of places like Stratford (a beautiful place, BTW, book descriptions truly cannot do it justice). He/she also managed to make the backstage events and preparations seem equally intriguing, no mean feat.<br />Kinny is well-written and drawn. She reacts in a manner in keeping with her age and background, but evolves over the course of the book into a more mature and experienced gal. I thought Lucas was a bit weird, but not enough that I didn't like him (although I wish a bit more time had been spent on him)<br />Sadly, no book is perfect. One thing that could -- and should, for it is handled rather clumsily -- have been dropped was the occasional political statement concerning Canada and French Canadians. While it is in keeping with the statement that Macbeth's events are universal, the handling wasn't subtle enough to be likable.<br />Overall, this is a very cool book if you are a fan of fantasy/horror or Shakespeare.

It's an enjoyable fantasy with touches of SF and a bit of teen novel as well (though a good amount, not the unbearable levels of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes or anything). He also comes up with the concept of a World Weaver, which I found very original.<br />A new kid at school is always treated weirdly, but in this case there is a reason. Larkin, the new boy at tenth-grader Peggy's school, is undeniably weird. But weird in a way that neither Peggy nor her friends can possibly guess. After a highly embarrassing incident when Larkin and his mom are invited over, Larkin admits that he is a World Weaver--by imagining something, he can bring it into existance. (And he has more self control than I EVER could)<br />Larkin is there to bring others to help him defeat the evil Gurnacht, another World Weaver who is trying to destroy Earth via the creation of another world. Unsurprisingly, Peggy agrees to join in, and two others team up as well: Regina, an unpopular and challenged girl, and a Donnie the popular jock. They set off through time and space to save Earth from annihilation, and soon must learn to depend on each other and themselves...<br />Craig Etchison crafts a fine portrayal of the World Weavers, the incredibly powerful beings who are capable of simply thinking things into existance. Larkin's portrayal rings true both as a young boy, and as a person who has an immense responsibility to think of. Though Regina and Donnie were not as clearly defined as Peggy was, nevertheless they are intriguing and grow gradually as they are forced to depend on each other. This theme of teamwork is very well done.<br />I found the writing style a little bare, but overall this is a creative and engaging piece of fantasy. I hope that Mr. Etchison writes more!	2001-06-02

Unlike the humorless, preachy Arthuriana that usually gets ground out these days, Gerald Morris produces lighthearted, humorous little stories about quirky knights and sensible young squires. \\"The Squire's Tale\\" is a charming little fantasy story based on an old Arthurian legend, with plenty of wit and adventure to go around.<br /><br />Terence lives with a rather befuddled out hermit in the woods... until the day he encounters a young Irish knight named Gawan, whom the hermit says will soon have Terence as a squire (the hermit can see the future, but only dimly knows of the past). When arrogant Sir Hautubris arrives and threatens the three, Gawain fends him off with a stewpot - and soon ends up going to his uncle's castle, Camelot, with his new squire.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, at a banquet, a white hound and hart (deer) go bounding through, followed by the most hideous woman anyone there has ever seen. Somehow she manages to get Sir Tor, Sir Gawain and Terence to go a-hunting for the hound and hart. They meet knights and ladies, dwarves and enchanters -- most of whom are one bean short of a pound -- and eventually bump into the Seelie Court...<br /><br />The book is based heavily on a traditional Arthurian story, \\"Sir Gawain and the Loathly Lady.\\" But Gerald Morris avoids the excessively \\"realistic\\" approaches of most Arthurian fiction -- instead he goes back to the medieval Anglo setting of the old Malory retellings, and mixes them together with some faerie stuff and plenty of humor.<br /><br />Morris has a light, smooth humorous style with plenty of hilarious moments (Gawain beating up Hautabris with the stewpot!), but also some eerie moments and a very odd romance. If there's a flaw, it's that his writing style hasn't fully flowered, but there's plenty of potential and some very evocative moments in there as well.<br /><br />Terence is a thoroughly likable protagonist -- smart, funny, intelligent and a great foil for Gawain, a sexy wry knight (whom I visualize as looking like a young Liam Neeson) who is treated far better here than in many traditional stories. Sir Tor is also a likable guy, being a field-hand who dreams of becoming a knight -- and while Queen Guinevere is a twit, Morris gives a loveable human edge to old favorites like King Arthur himself and Merlin.<br /><br />\\"Squire's Tale\\" deftly mingled Malory's Arthurian tales with a fun, quirky sensibility and some likable, fully-fleshed characters.

As evidenced by masters such as Patricia McKillip, often worthy and original fantasies slip out of print under the wave of Tolkien ripoffs. Sylvia Engdahl's books are in that class, and thank God Meisha Merlin is reprinting them! May they keep on doing so.<br />The main character is Noren, a guy who knows that the world is unjust. The Scholars and Technicians are the only people allowed to use machinery and metals, and enter the City (which, of course, he also craves to enter). They also control the knowledge meted out to the lower caste systems, into which you are born and can never hope to rise from.<br />The High Law is why these rules are there, but a prophecy promises that knowledge and machinery will be accessible to everyone, not just the Scholars. Noren, however, doesn't care about High Law or the Prophecy, believing that High Law is simply oppression and the Prophecy untrue. But freeing his people to equality will be a strange and hard task...<br />Once again, Engdahl creates a believable and thought-provoking piece of SF/fantasy that doesn't fall to the usual ray-guns-or-dragons cliches. The questions raised about freedom in this book kept making me pause in the middle of a page, thinking deeply about what was being shown in the story. For fans of action: There isn't much. For fans of originality/intelligence: There's plenty.<br />Noren, the idealistic rebel, is a particularly endearing character. Like the characters in &quot;Enchantress from the Stars&quot; he is complex and multifaceted, and grows as characters should through his trials. His relentless search for truth is fascinating to the reader, and there are entire pages where you may forget you are reading a story.<br />Faith, truth, and knowledge are the cornerstones of this book, in my eyes. Yet they are not heavy-handed in their presentation, rather they are subtlely woven into the plot. Engdahl's writing style is, if possible, even more captivating than in &quot;Enchantress,&quot; descriptive without getting too overwordy.<br />I'm not certain if this will appeal to the younger readers of &quot;Enchantress,&quot; as this has topics in it that may bore them. (If your kids have read Tolkien, though, they will like this). I recommend it to fans of Tolkien, Lewis, McKillip, and readers of &quot;Enchantress&quot; who can appreciate this multilayered tale.thout getting too overwordy.<br />I'm not certain if this will appeal to the younger readers of &quot;Enchantress,&quot; as this has topics in it that may bore them.

I don't do thrillers, I do a few mysteries. But I saw this book at a buddy's house and started flipping through. Next thing I knew, I was done and eager for something more...<br />&quot;Crowning Circle&quot; takes takes place in Chatsford Ohio (not real place) starring forensic PhD shrink Skeet Cullum and his engineer buddy Jake. Skeet has his own unconventional ideas about death, which have turned out to be useful while assisting the cops. Jake, on the other hand, is a slightly weird genius who owns his own company. What do these men have in common? On Thursdays they play guitar at Jake's.<br />But what is a thriller without deaths? Three of them, violent and disturbing, take place while Skeet tries to propose to his girlfriend, Shirley, a Vietnamese/black beauty (and a very interesting character to boot). Skeet is increasingly disturbed, partly because he was intending to adopt one of the victims, and Jake decides to help his friend - and discover both what is behind Skeet's mask, and the truth behind those killings...<br />Very few authors successfully capture small town atmosphere, or the tones of true friendship between people. This lends the book a rather thoughtful air. Skeet and Jake make a great detective pair, as they have the double blessing of not being &quot;standard&quot; crime-solvers and being excellent characterized. Lankford gets inside their heads very well, allowing the reader to sympathize without strain.<br />As far as writing goes, this book does not fall into the trap of many modern thrillers and mysteries: Over-detail. Too many books go into extensive and often disgusting detail about virtually everything, from jail cells to cops' apartments to the bathrooms of fast-food restaurants. This book doesn't--the story alone carries the atmosphere, and it does a good job.<br />I felt pleasantly relaxed and refreshed upon finishing, and hoping that at least some future works will include Skeet and Jake.<br />I'm looking forward to future novels by JR Lankford, though I suspect that he/she has all that's needed...t least some future works will include Skeet and Jake.<br />I'm looking forward to future novels by JR Lankford, though I suspect that he/she has all that's needed...	2001-05-29

Her latest book, &quot;Treasure at the Heart of the Tanglewood&quot; is an amazing fantasy with a truly amazing lead character.<br />The main character is Brown Hannah, a young woman with plant bugs woven in her hair, and without the memory of how she came to the Tanglewood. She lives with an assortment of odd animals - and a strange wizard who tells her not to leave the forest.<br />Supposedly within the Tanglewood forest is a great treasure guarded by the Boar. When one knight survives an encounter with the Boar, Hannah nurses him back to health - and enjoys his company, as she has never truly had a companion before. When the wizard takes an awful revenge on the unsuspecting knight, Hannah rebels and flees to turn the knight back into his human form. She transforms along the way into Green Hannah, then Golden Hannah. When she returns to the Tanglewood she is now Russet Hannah, her role shifting as the seasons change into autumn.<br />Meredith Ann Pierce outdoes herself in this sedate tale of nature and magic. Though &quot;Woman Who Loved Reindeer&quot; did not entrance me as much as the Darkangel trilogy, this one captivated me from the first page.<br />Hannah herself is a great character. She manages to encompass traits such as naivete and innocence, while still being brave and intelligent. Her transformation of knowledge as she goes through her various incarnations is believable, as are her interactions with such people as the knight and wizard. As I read this story, I also read the story of the Scottish goddess Beira, who also transformed with the passing seasons.<br />The writing style is lyrical and captivating, skillfully evoking the images that Pierce clearly wanted to show. Descriptions of the Tanglewood are especially beautiful, as Ms. Pierce always does an excellent job with nature descriptions.<br />A thoroughly enjoyable fantasy!riptions.<br />A thoroughly enjoyable fantasy!	2001-05-29

A seemingly orphaned fosterling is raised by kindly Sir Ector, doesn't really know who he is. This story gives a mild but enjoyable twist on the old tale.<br />Artos is a young orphan in Sir Ector's castle, whose only playmates are the sons of Sir Ector, who often look down on him. One day, as he chases the dog Boadie into the woods, he comes across a cave that appears to have a massive dragon inside it. Though Artos is initially afraid, he befriends the ancient dragon. The dragon, in exchange for foodstuffs from the kitchen, will teach Artos wisdom.<br />The teachings that the dragon give Artos unconsciously change his outlook and his treatment of other people - even those below him. But after a strange incident in which the dragon temporarily vanishes, Artos discovers the truth about his friend.<br />Aside from the works of Gerald Morris, I don't think I've found a more likeable version of King Arthur than Artos. The lessons that he is taught are mild but creep into the mind and take root, transforming him effectively from a &quot;bulky, unruly, illiterate boy&quot; to a thoughtful and compassionate soul (he isn't perfect, but who is?)<br />The supporting cast is sparkling, from &quot;Garlic&quot; Meg the kitchen maid, ancient Druid wiseman Linn, and the cheerful smith who provides Artos with his first sword. The writing style is admittedly a bit bare at times, but not so much that it is difficult to read. The dialogue and visualization of the final chapter are perhaps the best part, almost mystical.<br />A small note to those reading this book for the first time: Read carefully what the supporting characters say, and you might just guess ahead of time what is up with the dragon.<br />A magical tale without real magic, this is an enjoyable tale for lovers of a darn good story and a must-see for Arthuriana nuts!	2001-05-29

Aside from these, he has also written a lot of sparkling standalone adventures, drawing from cultures all around the world.<br />&quot;The Arkadians&quot; takes place in a vaguely Grecian setting, when a young boy flees evil fortunetellers and a hot-tempered king. He soon teams up with a talking donkey and a witty magical girl, to find the mysterious Lady.<br />&quot;The Remarkable Journey of Prince Jen&quot; follows a young Chinese prince and his sharp-tongued servant, who travel to a beautiful land to ask the king of it how he governs so well. The result is a quest that teaches Jen a few things...<br />&quot;The Iron Ring&quot; concerns a young Indian king who recklessly gambles away his kingdom, wealth, and life to a stranger, and an iron ring appears on his finger. He must travel to a distant kingdom with his companions before his lesson is truly learned.<br />Alexander's casts often include similar characters: the flawed hero who needs to learn something on the way, the odd and often self-deprecating sidekick, and the girl with wit and intelligence and little patience with needless idiocy. Additionally, in these particular stories there are often old myths and legends from their respective cultures scattered through the plot.<br />Though for sheer pathos and scope these books do not match the Prydain Chronicles, they are nevertheless great stories by a master storyteller.	2001-05-29

Peters surrounds her acerbic heroine with mounds of puffy pink luvvyluv, but also tosses in a startling murder into the mix.<br /><br />Jacqueline Kirby, seeking to expand her horizens and get out of a romantic rut, travels to New York for a romance writers' convention. After educating herself on sexy schlock, she encounters a bunch of colorful celebrities there -- a scathing columnist, a rabid feminist, an obsessive fan, an old classmate, the gorgeous and talented Queen of Romance Valerie Valentine, a sexy male writer, and a sinister yet hearty literary agent.<br /><br />Then the columnist dies unexpectedly, and it seems that Valentine is the target. Jacqueline begins peeling away the layers of cotton-candy romance to find out what ugly secrets are important enough to kill for. Was it jealousy, hatred, or money? (Surprisingly, passion doesn't enter into it). Armed with the ugliest hat and the fattest purse in the world, she sets out to smoke out the killer.<br /><br />\\"Die For Love\\" is a massive tonal shift for the too-short Jacqueline Kirby series. After two pretty serious, European-flavoured mysteries, suddenly we're in New York and immersed in hilarious romantic spoofery -- and you can tell Elizabeth Peters is having a delightful time mocking the romance genre.<br /><br />So she intertwined satire and a clever whodunnit very nicely, swinging deftly between the funny (Jacqueline having a \\"war of quotes\\" with Hattie) and a strong collection of motives, suspects and some clever literary allusions mixed in with the over-the-top schlock. But she also reminds us of some of the more serious results of the romance genre, such as the \\"rape=love\\" message.<br /><br />Jacqueline is her usual irrepressible self -- big fat purse, flamboyant clothes, and the lofty position of a librarian with a naughty streak. She steps further from \\"conventional detective\\" into her unique, perkily eccentric niche. One interesting fact is that in this book, she sets out to write a historical romance.<br /><br />And she's backed by a deliciously colourful cast of characters -- demure Sue, the sexy but beleagured hunk Victor, the hilarious hardcore feminist Betsy, the bewigged and timid Valerie Vanderbilt, and the grotesquely scheming Hattie.<br /><br />\\"Die For Love\\" isn't quite worth dying for, but it's not hard to love.

(Though I do wonder why &quot;Heartlight,&quot; &quot;Ancient One,&quot; and &quot;Merlin Effect&quot; weren't the ones compiled, as the series is incomplete here)<br />&quot;The Lost Years of Merlin&quot; kicks off the series, in which a young boy with strange powers and lost memories ventures to the magical land of Fincayra. There, he makes friends, enemies - and discovers both who he is, and what his destiny may be.<br />&quot;Seven Songs of Merlin&quot; picks up where &quot;Lost Years&quot; leaves off. Emrys Merlin is given the powerful Flowering Harp to heal the barren lands on Fincayra. But when he pridefully uses his powers to bring a loved one to Fincayra, he ends up unleashing evil...<br />&quot;Fires of Merlin&quot; picks up where &quot;Seven Songs&quot; leaves off, with Merlin, Rhia, and Elen relaxing in a beautiful part of Fincayra. But soon there are two ancient threats rising: the magic-draining kreelixes, now bred again to attack the Fincayrans, and a sleeping dragon named Valdearg who wants to revenge himself on Merlin.<br />TA Barron created a unique and endearing hero, full of faults and strong points. We follow Merlin through his journeys, suffering and learning along with him. The supporting characters are excellent, with quiet Elen, intelligent Rhia, depressing bard Bumblewy and the tiny giant Shim. The descriptive language is truly beautiful, showing us every image in the books.<br />This isn't the entire series, it's only the first three books. But it's also beautifully made and worth the price. A great diversion for fantasy fans waiting for the next book of their fave series...	2001-05-28

In an instant, they are transported to the alternate world of Great Kettles (yes, that is the real name).<br />It is, not surprisingly, a place filled with magic and mystery. The inhabitants include storybook characters like the Sandman, Father Time, and others like them that are seen only in storybooks and fairy tales. But, there is something extremely bad brewing: a giant is looking for something important and powerful, which is capable of destroying Great Kettles - and the town in our world also!<br />This story has similarities to others (like Alan Garner's &quot;Elidor&quot;) but is presented in a fresh and enjoyable manner. Readers who initially think &quot;oh ack, it has little-kid storybook characters in it!&quot; might like the portrayal of them - not to mention the fact that the illustrations are just beautiful.<br />It's a light, pleasant fantasy with above-par illustrations and a nice storyline that will keep the reader interested. It's not very long, though, and I wonder if it is targeting an audience slightly below the 9-12 crowd.<br />Looking forward to Book 2.	2001-05-28

No, this isn't the movie \\"Waterworld,\\" it is the slightly-fantasy \\"Floodland,\\" an enjoyable what-if story. Don't worry--aside from the premise there aren't many similarities to the movie, and first-time author Maurice Sedgwick does a good job.<br />In this new Earth, humans are learning ways to survive other than growing crops and breeding animals. The heroine is ten-year-old Zoe, accidently torn away from her missing parents. She is able to navigate with a rowboat, but is soon stranded on one of the bits of land by the Eels, a bunch of even more desperate teens who steal her boat.<br />Alone, she can't escape the Eels and their rotten commander alone, she does have a couple of allies. One is a nice guy named Munchkin, and another is a supposedly-insane \\"Mad William,\\" who claims that he is William Blake (hey, why not?) The Eels pay little attention to William, but Zoe recognizes that William may be able to help her find her parents &#8212; and land! But not surprisingly, there is a time limit, as the water is always going higher.<br />This is an undeniably enjoyable book. The heroine's characterization is a bit uneven at times, though she is still a likeable and realistic young woman. I especially liked the character of William, the mad seer who sees far more clearly than Dobby or the Eels (aside from nice-guy Munchkin--nice guy, very nice guy! Very good to read about).<br />The writing style was a little spare for my taste, but was descriptive enough and got across the images nicely; dialogue was pretty good, with interludes of VERY good interaction between Zoe and the others, especially Mad William. The usage of William Blake (the poet, not Mad William) to illustrate points along the way was especially good.<br />I'm looking forward to any future books of Mr. Sedgwick's!	2001-05-27

Andrecia is medieval and primitive, and in no way capable of handling the knowledge that advanced, spacefaring societies exist beyond their world.<br />But the heroine, Elana, soon becomes involved in a plot concerning the potential invasion of Andrecia. But it is near-impossible for her to save the Andrecians, superstitious and magic-believers, from an invasion.<br />Nearby is also a medical guy, Jarel, who feels remorse at the intentions of the Exploration Corps. They do not consider the population of Andrecia to be sentient and worthy of their notice, and promise to bring destruction down on Andrecia. There is also the son of an Andrecian woodcutter named Georyn, who identifies Elana as the Enchantress of the Stars. He believes that she has come for the purpose of testing him, if he can defeat a fearsome dragon in the forests.<br />This clash of the sophisticated and the simple is well-drawn and almost saddening at times. Georyn's faith in Elana's &quot;magic&quot; is truly touching, without making him appear ignorant or dumb. Elana is an excellent, intelligent heroine who captures your sympathy and does not let go. Her struggles with integrity and truth do not transcend the reader, but are ones that you feel as much as she does.<br />Too often in books there is a clash between magic and science, but in this particular book there is no clash. Perhaps that is partly due to the writing style -- half the magic seems to be in the otherworldly descriptions, interspersed with more grounded prose in the right places. (And Engdahl definitely knows how to write a beginning that will suck you in) Though some things like &quot;Imperial Corps&quot; and &quot;Federation&quot; imply a pseudo-Star-Trekkian space opera, this is none of the kind. This is a thoughtful work, filled with intelligent questions that will stimulate as it entertains.<br />This goes on the shelf beside Tolkien and the Riddlemaster trilogy.this is none of the kind.

Now she is being approached for one of the biggest book deals in history: Write a sequel to the historical/romance/fantasy epic &quot;Naked on the Ice&quot;--and yes, that is the real title. The author of &quot;Naked,&quot; the cult figure Kathleen Darcy, is supposedly dead by suicide, having vanished into the wilderness seven years back, despite being a bestselling millionaire.<br />Jacqueline gains the book deal, but must now deal with the rising specter of murder. She suspects strongly that Kathleen Darcy was being targeted for death  via &quot;accidents.&quot; Among her suspects are Kathleen's toad-like half-brother, St. John Darcy; Kathleen's ex-lover; the hack historical-romance writer Brunnhilde; the violent male rival; the married hunk whom &quot;Naked&quot;'s hero was physically based on; the deformed woman who has an almost obsessive fascination with Kathleen; and a sprinkling of other former friends, enemies, and relations...<br />What happened to Kathleen? Did she really commit suicide, or was she murdered? Is she alive, possibly? And what possible reason would anyone have to want her dead--money, love, revenge? Jacqueline intends to find the truth -- but what if she gets in the murderer's way?<br />Jacqueline is still the same effervescently vivid character as before. With her slightly eccentric nature and keen mind (not to mention her flamboyant clothing--it's a treat just to visualize her) she is an instantly likeable detective. Yet she doesn't show everything on the surface: when she meets with her new agent, she has a wry cynical edge that is very appealing.<br />You will thoroughly loathe such characters as St. John Darcy, Tom and Brunnhilde, the overweight historical hack. More appealing is Paul, whose turbulent feelings and quick thinking make him a nice if blunt guy.<br />Aside from the excellent descriptive writing and wonderful situations (St. John attempting to kiss Jacqueline; Jacqueline showing what Sarah looks like) you also get little pokes and jabs at the book industry. Agents, contracts, those little fifteen-percent paychecks, &quot;lit-ra-choor&quot; and bestselling authors are all lampooned slyly by Ms. Peters.

He has an array of bizarro relatives who flit by him, but who cannot erase the apparent boredom of bedrest. He's willing to try mild exercise and stimulation, but...<br />... he has to have a tutor. Apparently reading, watching &quot;talkies&quot; and making cartoons is not sufficient for a young boy. Old Aunt Annie agrees to be David's tutor--the Gorgon (whom accented Aunt Rosie calls Gawgon... get it? Gawgon and the Boy?)<br />But Aunt Anne is not just another formidable old lady -- she is witty and intelligent (wow, sounds like Alexander's other female heroes!) and intrudes on his written escapades. The Gawgon and the Boy also has hints of autobiography, given the time period and the unexotic locale, not to mention the excellent sense of atmosphere that permeates the story.<br />Both David and the &quot;Gawgon&quot; are enjoyable, quirky characters who clearly have the full imagination of Mr. Alexander behind them. Aspiring writers will be fascinated by the early writings of David, and his thoughts on them. Though they may initially dislike Aunt Annie, she soon shows her more endearing sides. In addition to these two, there is also a supporting cast of slightly weird relatives,<br />The descriptions of Philadelphia in the 20s sparkle with life and vividity. Such details as the &quot;new&quot; films with actual sound give it an added feeling of &quot;you are there.&quot; The words used to describe the characters and situations are excellent as always!<br />Lloyd Alexander's talent has not dulled, and this unique offering will satisfy any reader.	2001-05-15

Fans of Garth Nix's &quot;Seventh Tower&quot; series, with the unresolved endings, may like this book...<br />Darren and his friends are ordinary enough kids, who find a flier for the traveling freak show &quot;Cirque Du Freak&quot; --  snake boy, the wolf man, giant spider -- and a vampire. Not a warm and fuzzy exhibit show.<br />Darren and his friend Steve sneak to the freak show, where the ominous Mr. Tall informs them that every act is real -- which, naturally, they are (will kids read a scary book about a fake freak show? Course not). Steve recognizes Mr. Crepsly as a vampire, and exhibits the truly &quot;freaky&quot; wish to be a vampire as well. (Counseling, kid, counseling!) Making the situation even more unreal is Darren, who has a thing about spiders and wishes to steal the enormous arachnid Madame Octa. Darren must deal with an enormous spider, a sideshow full of frightening freaks, and his own best friend...<br />Darren is just weird enough to fit into this freaky story, without losing the understanding and sympathy of the readers. Steve was a bit too weird for my personal tastes, wanting to be a vampire and so forth, and so I had difficulty connecting with him--but that may have been intentional.<br />The writing style is snappy and spooky, in keeping with this genre, without becoming too wordy or gross as many horror books are. Atmosphere is handled well, especially in the Cirque Du Freak, and in scenes with Madame Octa and the vampire Crepsly.<br />The book occasionally becomes a little creepy for younger kids and a little too dark for the faint-of-heart. Additionally, descriptions occasionally become too thin and the characters sometimes take odd actions--but again, the second thing may be deliberate.<br />Though not flawless, I'll read the next book with pleasure.	2001-05-15
2017707:US	50881246	R2F4FO10P6B29C	0786808012	442293804	Artemis Fowl	Books	5	75	84	N	N	A new age of fantasy	Undoubtedly this will be constantly compared to Harry Potter, but for crying out loud, just because a book might become as highly-liked as HP doesn't mean that the plot has to amble along the same lines. Irish author Eoin Colfer makes an amazing debut in the US with this book.<br />Artemis Fowl is an astonishing criminal mastermind (he's also twelve), the end of a line of criminals, who now plans to rob the fairies/elves of their gold. The way that he plans to do so is kidnapping of an elf and subsequent ransom. Enter Captain Holly Short, a member of the LEPrecon (Lower Elements Police Reconnaisance--a cute touch that had me laughing out loud) and elvish Commander Root. And Holly is just perfect for the scheme.<br />Though there are folklore, fairies and fantasy, this is no ancient-themed tale -- but wholly of the 21st century, with a bit of high-tech stuff thrown in. Forget the usual wands, cauldrons and spells: There's a magical Book, but also powerful computers and a digital camera (dare you to find one of those in other modern juvenile fantasies...)<br />The characters -- especially peppery Holly and intelligent, wily Artemis -- are full of pizzazz and sparkle. The appearances of the otherworldly characters -- done to death in conventional fantasy -- were tempered by the 21st century nature of the setting, and the natures of their jobs and interactions. All are given a slightly twisted, smiling slant.<br />The pace is high-speed, with few lags in the plotline. Occasionally I lost track of what was going on, but a backtrack of a few pages fixed that. The writing style is a little too stark and undescriptive for my personal taste, but I suppose it would not be high-speed if there were a great deal of description.<br />Will Harry Potter fans like this? I truly cannot tell, they might not like the vast differences between the two -- but fans of quirky, imaginative fantasy will love it for sure.	2001-04-28

Wasn't disappointed. Can't wait for the third volume.<br />Neil and the Sisters Wyrd (sorry, Weird--uh, their name is Webster) -- also known as the Three Fates -- return in this story. Neil returns from London (previous book) bringing a young woman named Edie with him. But Edie is not just another female sidekick -- she is a vital asset to the Sisters, who want her to further their work.<br />But the Sisters have a powerful enemy -- Woden. He is planning to disrupt them by pulling Edie and the youngest Sister, Miss Veronica, through the bizarre time warp. Neil transports through time and space to find his friends. And if he can't, the world will disintegrate with the Cloth of Time.<br />This book is a worthy follow-up to Woven Path. It does suffer from the problematic &quot;we don't know what's going on because it doesn't stand alone&quot; syndrome, in which you won't understand most of the references and best points if you haven't read the first book. That is not to say that you won't understand anything, but best to read Book 1.<br />Neil has grown a bit from the boy we saw griping to his dad in the backseat. The responsibilities that are heaped on him have matured him in mind, and he acts more like an adult in this book. The Sisters are more awe-inspiring throughout, as we know what they are for the whole book, but they are still weird and quirky. Edie is excellent!<br />The writing style is descriptive when it needs to be, a good balance between wordiness and fast action. Fantasy is well-styled and intriguing...<br />A must-read story! Can't wait for book three...	2001-04-28

I only hope that Ms. Pattison writes more in future...<br />Hero Winchal Eldras, in the fantasy land of G'il Rim, is scarred by the untimely death of his little sister, when she wanders too close to the Rift and falls in. As his fear of heights caused him to hesitate at the last moment, he blames himself and locks himself away. But Winchal is not just a boy, he is a Wayfinder, part of a special group that has the ability to find ANYTHING and ANYONE.<br />But he is drawn out of his unhappy solitude when Prince Reynard arrives at his home, searching for a Wayfinder who could end a plague by going to the Well of Life. With the prince comes a telepathic Tazi hound named Lady Kala, who has never before endured the dangers that will confront both of the questers on their journey.<br />As uninspired as the cover is, the story itself is rich and unique. The concept of Wayfinder is intriguing, one of those It's-so-obvious-why-hasn't-someone-thought-of-it-before?, and seems to fit quite nicely with the almost alien surroundings. The writing style is a little better than usual, not as descriptive as I like but not too stark.<br />Both Winchal and Lady Kala are nicely drawn, good in their dialogue and good foils for each other. Winchal in particular was deeply written, with his guilt about his younger sister and how he dealt with that deep-rooted fear.<br />I hope that this isn't the only book to be written about this unique duo!	2001-04-14

One of the four (five if you count the new multi-story book) Chrestomanci books, this tale displays a unique and imaginative outlook on history, on prejudice, on tiny events that shape our futures. And the story's good too. *wink*<br />A note is left on a teacher's desk: SOMEONE IN 6-B IS A WITCH. To the kids in this school's class, in a rather dreary part of England, it's not entirely clear whether the adults take this seriously. Being a witch in this parallel universe is a bad thing: Witches are found, interrogated, and burned at the stake. To make things worse, students are beginning to suspect each other -- and themselves -- of being witches.<br />Odd occurrances continue, such as a flock of birds inside the school, shoes vanishing, and one particularly bizarre speech spell. Several lonely students form alliances, and soon they encounter the one man who might be able to help them -- Chrestomanci the magician.<br />A little less sprightly than Charmed Life or Magicians of Caprona, this is nonetheless a stirring and well-crafted tale of magic and parallel universes. We are treated to a unique view of how the kids in Larwood House both torment each other and protect each other, and a unique magical twist near the end.<br />Nan and Charles are the recognizable Charlie Browns, an angry young boy and overweight, much-teased girl. The clique of perfect, snobby Teresa and her hangers-on is something that any girl will recognize, in their constant mockery, jeering, and exclusion. Charles has to deal with equally perfect, snobby boys in his wing, led by Simon, who also kick around scrawny Brian.<br />Other accompanying characters, like Brian's father Mr. Wentworth and Nirupam, a low-key, intelligent boy from India who wants all his classmates safe. Prepare to hate Miss Hodge, for I promise you that you will. And if you have read of Chrestomanci before, you will not be disappointed. If this is your first book, then he is charming, witty, intelligent... but never boring.<br />Jones' writing style is near-perfect -- things do go a bit undescribed at times, but not severely -- and she gets effortlessly inside the characters' heads, while offering sometimes-absurd situations that fit well into the plot. At a few points during the plot, the pace does lag a bit, but never severely; the complexity, however, is truly wonderful in a piece of juvenile literature and never hits inconsistencies.<br />Enter the tangled world of Larwood House, and become addicted instantly to the Chrestomanci Chronicles!r />Jones' writing style is near-perfect -- things do go a bit undescribed at times, but not severely -- and she gets effortlessly inside the characters' heads, while offering sometimes-absurd situations that fit well into the plot.

(...)Pilgrim Parties (read: Fantasy tourists) are taken through a magical portal to the magical land where they can battle and triumph over the Dark Lord, who is elected periodically. Everyone is sick of the Dark Lord tours, such as kings and magicians, who have to take sides with Good or Evil; however, the tour guide Chesney isn't about to lose any money there. The newest Dark Lord is Derk, a wizard who mainly wants to create bizarre critters. But apparently, like jury duty, you have to be Dark Lord..<br />The problem is, Derk isn't very GOOD at it. He and his odd family manage to rearrange things and make him Dark Lord, but unfortunately being the Force of Evil is not as easy as it looks. Add that to possible stealing from Chesney and you have a bizarre fantasy/fantasy-spoof that is difficult to put down.<br />Jones's spoofing of fantasy started in her delightful \\"Tough Guide to Fantasyland,\\" and many of the elements involved appear here, as if she has novelized the pseudo-encyclopedia. This fact occasionally makes the book a bit more \\"drifty\\" than her Chrestomanci tales, but it's still a darn sight better than most books.<br />And funny indeed this book is (well, where it isn't creepy). The scramble to create the perfect \\"Dark Lord's stronghold\\"-type building is hilarious, as is the side-splitting idea of tourists engaging in specialized tours in which they get to be High Fantasy heroes. Derk's kids aren't as well defined as is usual for Ms. Jones, but Derk the Reluctant Dark Lord makes up for that.<br />Her writing style is its usual chipper, brisk style, full of fun descriptions. The blue demon was an especial treat, as were those terrific griffins...<br />A small warning: You may want to have a copy of \\"Tough Guide\\" alongside you while reading this book, to get the full effect of it's kookiness. And can't wait to see the sequel, \\"Year of the Griffin...\\"	2001-04-10

Snappy and well-paced, the book is also dotted with sweet moments that may bring a tear to the eye.<br />William lives in a nice suburb with his ever-busy parents (I found it sweet how he still loves and treasures his parents, despite their frequent absence) and the nanny/maid, Mrs. Phillips. William receives shattering news: Mrs. Phillips intends to return to England. As a consolation gift, she gives him a toy castle with accompanying knight, and a tiny metal charm.<br />Then the knight comes to life. The tiny silver man, Sir Simon, soon befriends William as the young man goes to desperate lengths to keep Mrs. Phillips. But a knight can't forget his duty, and soon William becomes entangled in the clutches of Alastor, the evil wizard. But how can a physically unimpressive ten-year-old defeat a powerful magician?<br />William is an enjoyable character, made more so by his anxiety over Mrs. Phillips and general decency toward his fellow man. I also enjoyed the comparisons using his gymnastics lessons as examples of self-control and discipline.<br />Mrs. Phillips was a lovely character, very compassionate and caring, but firm in her intentions. Alastor was pure evil, while Sir Simon was a thoroughly likeable and decent guy, without being too perfect or anything like that. I found Calender to be a rather sorry character, and was glad of the resolution written for her.<br />The plot is pleasantly original, though I wish less time had been spent in &quot;our&quot; world. The writing style is rather ordinary, the first half a bit slow, and the descriptions somewhat underfleshed. However, the simple yet effective plot and good characterization overcome those problems. Without a doubt, kids should check out this book, and also the even-better sequel &quot;The Battle for the Castle.&quot;	2001-04-08

Somewhere between Alice In Wonderland and a deluxe dictionary, this book is a wordy phenomena that will amuse kids and adults alike. Word jokes abound, alongside math jokes and the quintessential quest. (Did I just say that?)<br />Milo is a young boy who is bored -- we know virtually nothing of his life other than that, but it's enough. One day a little purple tollbooth with accompanying car appear where he lives, and out of boredom takes a little trip through the tollbooth. But soon he finds himself in a place unlike any other.<br />Mired in the doldrums, where the potatolike inhabitants laze around, Milo meets Tock the watchdog, who proceeds to take him to Dictionopolis. After a few run-ins with the bizarre local inhabitants (enormous insect the Spelling Bee, the dignified Humbug, the square cop) he is informed by the Which that Rhyme and Reason, two beautiful and wise princesses, are missing. Until they are returned, the kings of mathematics and words will continue to clash and there will be constant disharmony.<br />So Milo, being the hero, is sent off with the Humbug and Tock to rescue Rhyme and Reason. Along the way he encounters a menagerie of strange creatures and situations, like the kingdom where speaking is impossible. Or the Horrible DYNNE, a smoky monster who loves horrible noises. Contradictory Canby. The &quot;shortest tall man,&quot; &quot;tallest short man,&quot; &quot;thinnest fat man,&quot; and so forth who are all the same man. The demons are truly chilling as Milo and his friends reach the end of their journey. And many, many more!<br />This book's appeal is not limited to kids. Many of the sly word jokes may be caught mainly by adults, but even if you do not understand one they will still entertain. The book is written with a little too little detail, but the sweet illustrations make up for any lack of wordiness. The teachings near the end are carefully woven for young readers (though some adults could use the message) but don't become heavy-handed in their delivery.<br />The characters are great. Cool-headed, rational Milo could be any one of us from the way he tries to deal with his sitations. Tock, the very patient watchdog, is a wonderful character full of pizzazz; yet you know he has something of a soppy heart underneath. The Humbug is simply a delightfully skewed character.<br />Fans of Lewis Carroll, witty satire, and/or original fantasy should check this out immediately!t don't become heavy-handed in their delivery.<br />The characters are great.

But one day as they are picking flowers, a strange creature with enormous dark wings scoops Eoduin up and leaves Aeriel seeking revenge for her mistress. She too is taken captive, and discovers that the hideous darkangel of legend is a gorgeous young man, with giant black wings and an icy heart. She is to spin and weave clothing for his living-corpse wives, from whom he has drained their souls. Aeriel finds herself with a terrible dilemma: should she kill the darkangel, or try to redeem him?<br />The sense of true fantasy is evident in this book, naming the sun Solstar and such things. Though some things (like saris) are recognizable, overall the book has a sense of comfortable otherworldliness. The writing style is descriptive, poetic.<br />The darkangel himself is thoroughly hateable in a likeable sort of way. Just when I am really starting to despise him, he displays a tiny hint of humanity. I actually felt very sorry for him near the end, and during the storytelling session, which is quite an impressive feat. His flailings between his humanity and the darkness inside him are quite compelling, as are Aeriel's attempts to understand him.<br />Aeriel is an awesome contradiction, a determined young woman who is also unsure of herself. Perhaps it's because her determination stems from a desire to help free the wives of the darkangel, and to protect innocent people in future. Her dangerous journey to find the starhorse is like a very long poem, beautiful and evocative.<br />And then there's the bizarre little man who lives in underground caverns, who advises Aeriel. He's a perfect gem of the Lloyd Alexander school, funny and wise and quirky. The little mage never makes things too easy, but manages to be a truly engrossing character. Hope he returns in the next two books of the trilogy.<br />A warning: If you like standalones, this will stand on its own, but is obviously meant to be part 1 of ?.

Though a bit too short and a bit too shallow, it's sweet.<br />Twelve-year-old neighbors Hailey and Claire have been best buddies all their lives, but this summer is the last they will be able to hang out together. Claire will be moving to Florida, and this hangs a pall over their fun. A nearby club will also shut down at the end of summer, a place that they know and enjoy.<br />But what happens when a mermaid is washed ashore? Aquamarine is not your typical Little Mermaid type, being both cranky and lovelorn. Despite the fact that land-based life will destroy her, Aquamarine falls in love with a local boy (I didn't see his charm, personally). Hailey and Claire manage to smuggle her about in a wheelchair -- but how can they help her survive, if she doesn't want to go back?<br />It's a nice little book, with excellent descriptions of the local areas. Unfortunately, Aquamarine was the only truly interesting character, as Hailey and Claire are typical book-kids who could be lifted from any other book. Their bright spot is the separation anxiety, which is often reserved mainly for parents. But things simply happen, with little insight into the characters' thoughts.<br />I also found the shortness of this novel distracting -- there are a fair number of pages, but there are very few lines per page, and the omniscient voice of the narrator destroys some opportunities to initiate more character development (telling us stuff about Aquamarine's background rather than having HER tell Claire and Hailey and US).<br />I advise younger kids to read this book, but middle grade and older readers will find themselves severely frustrated.	2001-04-07

A fitting conclusion to the &quot;Merlin&quot; trilogy, beautifully written but less like a nature poem than it's predecessor. Still laden with hints of the future, &quot;Merlin&quot; is a wonderful brief read.<br />Merlin escapes from angry dogs, pulled to safety by one of the wodewose, wild men and women who have their dwellings out in the forests. Despite the name, they are relatively civilized, but recognize the amazing talents that Merlin possesses. He sometimes dreams (in a weird sort of way) of the future, and in one astounding scene he uses his powers to heal. These events lead both to a shattering conclusion -- and a fateful meeting with a tiny boy named Cub.<br />Merlin is more mature in this book, having learned about greed and deception and wanting neither of them. There are hints at the end of his future mentoring of Arthur and additionally a twist in his traditional role.<br />The writing style is as evocative as ever, poetic and almost dreamy, bringing every described image to life. If I can someday write half as well as Ms. Yolen, I will be very happy.	2001-04-07

This book is wonderful, emotional, deep, but all wrapped in simple prose and style.<br />It centers around Jonathon, a teenage boy who has something that no one else in his native Valley has: blue eyes. Rumors flit about his mother, by the people who live in the valley and suspecy that the young boy is a Dalriada. The Dalriada are viewed as barbarians by the Valley folk, with their horses and astounding powers. They have blue eyes -- and, according to others, they also have horns from their foreheads. The Valley inhabitants fear that, as Jonathon reaches adulthood, he will go insane -- and mysterious welts are rising on his forehead, where horns would be...<br />These rumors reach their peak when Jonathon's mother dies, and he is accused of bringing a blight down. He must leave his home for his future, among the Dalriada. He will go to the ends of the world and back again, with the Firegold apples that will help him -- and those he loves -- to their destiny.<br />This book is elevated from a usual coming-of-age novel via Calhoun's beautiful prose and style. Her fantasy world is very similar to ours (a reference is made to a grandfather clock) yet the mythos and mystical experiences are different. It also brings to the forefront the disgusting bigotry and prejudice, without being heavy-handed in the execution.<br />Jonathon is a wonderful character, growing in strength and complexity as the book progresses. Some of the people who oppose him are a bit too narrow-minded for outright believability, but that is a very small flaw in a very good book.<br />I advise all admirers of good fiction -- fantasy or otherwise -- to check into this book.

Rumplestiltskin is not just a repulsive little troll -- and has a secret identity. Surprise endings and weird twists (and very good questions) are presented, all in VVV's unique style and peppered with her sense of humor.<br />Though twelve bucks may seem like a lot for a small book, don't let the size deter you.

Robin Jarvis, who wrote the great fantasy book &quot;Dark Portal,&quot; weaves an intriguing fantasy story.<br />Neil Chapman is &quot;our hero,&quot; a young man who comes to the Wyrd Museum (a pun on Weird?), a rather grimy and unimpressive building in the East End. Creepy hardly describes the odd museum, run by three old ladies who are... uh, creepy. Who are they? What are they?<br />Better brush up on Greek and Norse myths, as these bizarre old ladies are the Fates, who weave a cloth composed of the life-threads of all the people of the world into their future. When Neil steps into the Separate Collection, he is swept through time and space to London. In WW2. A scramble will result before Neil can hope to return, with some odd new friends...<br />The idea of a magical place being run by the Fates is an intriguing and original idea indeed, and Jarvis does it justice. The three are suitably creepy and strange, and the inner mood of their museum matches their personalities.<br />Neil is a better-than-usual book hero, a very realistic person with great reactions and some very good lines. And the character of Ted was sweet, nuff zed. Jarvis skillfully manages to make Ted believable and sympathetic, not juvenile or stupid.<br />The writing style is snappy where it needs to be and drawn out where it needs to be, with pretty good descriptions and characterization. I got confused a few times in this book, where the plot took a twist and I inadvertantly missed it, but the story flows well overall.<br />A wonderful read, and I cannot wait for &quot;Raven's Knot&quot;!	2001-04-06

Hylton wove a tapestry of colorful personalities in a backward little English town, a delightful drama narrated by an intelligent young woman with a steady mind.<br />Maya is a privileged little girl in Africa, where her father is a prosperous farmer. Her parents are killed in a raid of their farm, and the bewildered child is sent to a particularly dreary part of England to live with her uncle and aunt. Her uncle is a piously self-righteous snoot, who disapproves of anything enjoyable or pretty for Maya. His only goal is that she grow up obedient, marry young to a pious dull guy, have lotsa babies. And the aunt has submerged her individuality under her husband's.<br />The only bright spot is Maya's life is her best friend, Emily, a spirited redhead who plays with her for many years. She also befriends a young woman of the &quot;gentry,&quot; but must deal with Gavin Gaynor, the girl's brother.<br />Her uncle claims she is too innocent and unworldly to have further education, but Maya manages to get permission to have further schooling. She knows the town is backward, and that she wants to do more with her life than marry and pop out children. After her uncle sabotages her attempts to become a teacher, she has to come home and help - and is given work as a governess.<br />But the tide of evil in the Gaynor family becomes apparent when Emily, pregnant, unwed, and disgraced, disappears after refusing to name the father of her baby. And Gavin has taken a decided interest in Maya...<br />The writer's old-fashioned style and vivid characters leap off the page. In a subtle manner, she presents women as they were viewed back then, and Maya's constant efforts to remain intelligent, strong, and capable of looking after herself are heartwarming.<br />If you find a copy, then by all means read it!	2001-04-06

I was introduced to these rather late (hey, I wasn't alive in the 50s, okay?) I find them charming and timeless. Even though the skirts are ankle-length, the boys don't swear, and Daddy doesn't get any mouthing off from the kids, the people in it seem modern in their feelings. And it takes a darn talented writer to have various girls patting on beauty products and not make them look vain...<br />We follow teenage Betsy, along with best friend Tacy, through the tangle of young adult life. Accompanying them are Betsy's sister the budding singer Julia, her warm and kind parents, and a new character: the Ray family cook. Amid the flurry of friendships and incidents therein, Betsy is courted (courted, not dated. It meant walking her to school) by at least two boys -- Joe and Tony; she is also competing against Tony in an essay competition.<br />Though many of the events in the book are fairly lighthearted, there are also serious topics. Among them is the growing attraction of the Episcopalian church for Julia and Betsy, who are Baptists. The question of how they can tell their father of their wishes was a very mature and intriguing plot device, and I was genuinely relieved at the conclusion of it.<br />Despite the various &quot;edgy&quot; books put out now, this is a book that is far more appealing -- sweet and bright, but never sugary or sentimental. The writing style is surprisingly modern and descriptive, without overdoing anything. The speech patterns are GREAT.<br />This book falls into the same category as &quot;Meet Me In St. Louis,&quot; a nice world with nice people. Mr. and Mrs. Ray are wise and kindly -- not just to their kids, but all kids. Betsy is a great character, strong and independent and remarkably free in her thinking, considering these events took place near the turn of the century.<br />Be sure to read this book! (And all of Lovelace's books...)..)	2001-04-06

After listing the names by which she is often called (&quot;Martha de Sade&quot;) she gets down to business: how to be like her in every respect.<br />The &quot;Papal Visit&quot; I wasn't crazy 'bout, but that definitely had some hilarious moments, including a sidebar that describes her pilfering other people's figurines and knicknacks. &quot;Garden Party&quot; includes the mind-numbing recipes for &quot;Hand Picked Field Salad&quot; which will make you cry; and the flambe-related Smoked Woodchuck.<br />In the matter of taste and refinement, nothing can beat the &quot;circumcision day&quot; chapter, with recipes that will make you shriek. And for Valentine's Day, Martha shows us how to souse and seduce... or just souse. Then she flits back to her childhood for &quot;Mother's Day,&quot; going over various &quot;regular&quot; meals by her mama. The next chapter describes how to have a beach cookout, with one of the worst fish visuals I've ever seen!<br />&quot;Christmas/Holiday Decorating&quot; describes how you can horrify your friends and neighbors with perfect holiday decorating; the piece de resistance, however, is the chapter on Death and what to do if one of your guests dies (&quot;Quickly, while you still can, shape and level the deceased's hand to hold a serving tray and begin setting out hors d'oeuvres...&quot;<br />This book is written in a bitingly satirical style, and is graced by various straight-faced photos of &quot;Martha&quot; taking the necessary actions, such as preparing a tasteful lined coffin or cheerfully roping a date. And the cover is just a delight! As is this book!<br />(If you are a die-hard fan of Martha, however, do not read this book. Ever. You will explode)	2001-04-06

While retaining the innocently beautiful prose and style of the previous book, Ms. Yolen manages to show Merlin growing in human wisdom.<br />Merlin's foster family is killed in a house fire, and as the young boy grieves for them, he is caught by Fowler, a vicious thief. The sadistic Fowler takes great enjoyment in tormenting Merlin,but the boy manages to escape him to find a wandering band of magicians, who soon discover that the boy can see into the future. As they try to harness him for their own ends, Merlin uses his magic to elude them...<br />The innocent wild boy of &quot;Passager&quot; is gone, and we get to see hints of Merlin's future power in this story. Once again Yolen evokes almost painfully clear emotions in her readers, with the beautiful prose and realistic characterizations.<br />The second book of a trilogy is often weak, but not so here!	2001-04-05

Nevertheless, it's a must-see for lovers of lyrical wording.<br />This book follows the early life of a young boy abandoned in the forest, who rapidly forgets who he is and where he has come from. He adjusts rapidly, though, living in the glory of nature, outside of contact with other humans. His one fear, however, is dogs.<br />He is found and adopted by a kind woodsman named Robin, the boy's fatherly reintroduction to the human race. The scenes in which Merlin encounters such &quot;marvels&quot; as glass are wonderfully done, as is the scene where he remembers his name. We are never told fully where he comes from -- there are only hints at beginning and end.<br />The writing style is lovely. Yolen is one of the few writers of our time who can captivate with almost no dialogue -- through a good portion of the book, people are not talking. Yet it never grows overdescriptive nor too stark. It's like a very long poem at times, with the descriptions of the forest where Merlin lives and of the things that he sees.<br />If you want to introduce your kids to Arthurian fiction, start with this. A wonderful book, a must-read! (On to the next two books)	2001-04-05

She works as a maid at the home of the Rivers family, and is often the victim of their bratty son Apollo. But one day a mysterious couple are the guests of the Riverses, and the woman (Cassandra) speaks briefly to Hope. Soon after, she is swept magically to the Basset.<br />Why is she there? And why is Apollo there also? Hope doesn't know until later, when she learns of a war between savage centaurs, and the beautiful winged horses (Pegasus) -- and a terrifying deed the centaurs are planning. Assisting her is the crew of the Basset, the winged horses, and sometimes Apollo....<br />The book is hardly flawless. The out-of-practice genii got old quick, and the idea about being wingED (you'll see if you read it) struck me as a big stretch. However, I was grateful to see a book that portrayed the centaurs as Greek mythos intended them, savage cowardly thiefs. And though the Pegasus did not speak and was not sentient, the winged horses were well-made, as was the roc. I also found Apollo's change in thought similar to that of Edmund in the Narnia Chronicles.<br />I advise you to read the original &quot;Voyage of the Basset&quot; before you read this, as I didn't understand many of the references (Cassandra and her sister, for one). They do explain it sufficiently, so if you have not read VotB you will still be able to understand who these people are and what the Basset is.<br />A cute little fantasy. Credendo vides!	2001-04-05

They're a nice diversion for the Harry Potter fan and a nice accompanying piece to the novels themselves. However, people who haven't read the books at least once (gosh, are there any left?) won't understand many of the references or sidenotes.<br />I preferred &quot;Magical Beasts&quot; to &quot;Quidditch,&quot; with a nice assortment of magical beasties rather than the descriptions of various broomstick fouls. (Though I am not a sports person) It was a cute touch to have little notes and scribblings on the edges of the pages, as many students do to their textbooks. (Although I wish that there had been more indication, other than writing style, who had made the notes - perhaps different-colored ink for different students?) The array of beasties and sports will appeal to fans of the books.<br />What I didn't like, and what takes a point off, is the fact that these are pamphlets rather than true textbooks. Given that Rowling did not need to think up a plot, characters, dialogue and so forth, couldn't she have given the poor at LEAST 150 pages per book? I found it rather unpleasant-sounding that the proceeds for these small and briefly written books, rather than &quot;Order of the Pheonix,&quot; are going to charity...<br />A cute diversion for the Harry Potter fan, but not for you if you are not a fan.	2001-04-04

Imagine a Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys mystery with all the delightfully cheesy trappings, set in Scotland with lots of occult bits. That is the basic description of Katherine Kurtz's \\"The Adept,\\" a stately supernatural thriller that seems to be gleefully rolling in cars, kilts, gentrified upper-crust cliches and magical reincarnation stuff. It's strictly a guilty pleasure -- fun but slightly goofy.<br /><br />Sir Adam Sandler is a shrink, baronet... and Adept mage for the forces of Light (ah, the shorthand for generic Good). While visiting an old friend, he encounters a young artist named Peregrine Lovat, who is on the verge of a nervous breakdown.<br /><br />It turns out that Peregrine has a psychic gift that allows him to foresee things and hear voices, and he's desperate for Adam's help. So Adam reveals that both of them are part of an elite force of reincarnated Templar knights, who have battled evil throughout the centuries. And now he's taking Peregrine under his wing to teach him.<br /><br />Unfortunately, dark things are afoot in Scotland, including the theft of a sword that may have supernatural power, grave-robbing, necromancy and a string of murders. Using ancient Scottish artifacts and blood magic, a wave of evil sorcerers are coming to steal an ancient treasure -- unless Adam and Peregrine can stop them.<br /><br />\\"The Adept\\" is porn for people who love reading about Anglicized aristocracy, big crumbling castles and ivy-draped manorhouses, blue-bloods and lots of clothes and cars. The story practically swims in this, until it sometimes feels like you're swimming in jolly-good, veddy-veddy-elegant surroundings -- especially since most of the main characters seem to be \\"the right sort of people\\" (minus the pleasantly middle-class McLeod).<br /><br />So if you don't like hearing about every aspect of clothing, jewelry and hairstyle at whatever genteely wealthy party the characters are attending, this may not be your cup of tea.<br /><br />However, the mystery is the strongest point of the story, if a bit Hardy Boys at times. The base of the book and its characters will be familiar to mystery fans: the detective and his sidekick, the friendly policeman (McLeod) who tags along on their adventures, and a dastardly plot to do... something. Despite a suspenseful prologue, it doesn't get moving until a good one-third of the way through the story, and things slowly rev up to the breathtaking climax.<br /><br />And Kurtz soaks it in a generous amount of occult goings-on, which may baffle people who don't know much about reincarnation, occult theory and the sort. There are even fairies (not cute little gauze-winged creatures, as Adam tells us), a Ban-sidhe, and a chuckleworthy cameo at the end.<br /><br />As for the characters, they feel slightly unreal -- Adam and Peregrine don't get angry or frustrated, they have no skeletons in their closets, they have no sex lives, and they're resolute pillars of virtue with few flaws. Peregrine is made somewhat more interesting, though, due to his emotional problems and initial hysteria. And McLeod is just an all-around fun guy, a rollicking Highland chieftain in a cop's uniform.<br /><br />\\"The Adept\\" has some serious flaws, particularly the focus on upper-crust trappings rather than the mystery -- but when it focuses on the mystery, it's a pretty fun supernatural thriller.s the strongest point of the story, if a bit Hardy Boys at times.

In the driven city of Amaranth, the motto is Better today than yesterday. Better tomorrow than today.&quot; And God help you if you strayed from that, as the central part of your life. But there are some people in that city who care more about dreams and useful knowledge than irrelevent ratings and scores on a series of tests. (People who score the highest live in great White mansions, while the lowest-rated live in Gray one-room tenements.)<br />Perhaps the most prominent of these is the family of Kestrel and Bowman, who defy many rules and the lifestyle of those around them. Kestrel is kicked to the bottom of her class, alongside amiable idiot Mumpo. But after she snaps and shocks many people in a public display alongside the wooden Wind Singer, she is banished to an entirely different kind of school - one populated by &quot;old children.&quot; She escapes and is given a mission by the ancient, hermit-like Emperor: Find the voice of the Wind Singer, and defeat the demonic Morah and its evil Zar army.<br />Kess does so, with Bo (and Mumpo) in tow. Her father is arrested and put in a prison with other men who dream but cannot ace the tests. Kess, Bo, and Mumpo must brave underground sludge civilizations, evil government officials, warring plains tribes, and the life-draining &quot;old children.&quot; Will they triumph over the Morah?<br />Why four stars? Aside from the repeated references to bodily emissions, the writing style was quite stark and did not give us much insight into the characters' inner thoughts. Though perhaps since Nicholson is a screenplay writer, this is unsurprising. In addition, the last fifty pages feel like Nicholson was told, &quot;You've got to speed things up, you're almost through the allotted pages!&quot; Very fast. There was also a bit too much of a happy ending for everyone concerned, but somehow it fitted.<br />However, the concept and execution are delightful. We are transported into a whole other world with a rigid caste system (I get the feeling that Nicholson really hates &quot;overachiever yuppie moms&quot;); to the underground &quot;mud&quot; village; to the plains of the Baraka/Omshaka. His descriptions are really stellar. And the &quot;old children&quot; are the most horrifying supernatural henchmen I've read of since the Black Riders; the Zars are chilling.<br />This book is an excellent read for any fantasy reader!

Though he specializes in medieval rodent battles, Jacques's talent shines in a new and unique offering. Though the cover, with a handsome lad in a storm-tossed ship, seems to indicate a very different kind of book from the kind it is.<br />Ben, the mute hero of the story, survives the destruction of the Flying Dutchman, a sailing ship. Now he wanders the Earth with his talking dog (interesting switch), living forever thanks to an angel. Apparently they're supposed to &quot;bring confidence and sympathy, help others to change their fate.&quot; Though this sounds like the beginning of a &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot;/&quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; drama, it's anything but.<br />Centuries pass, and the two come to the peculiar town of Chapelvale. The citizens allow them to stay, but the villain is plotting the industrial destruction of their town. A scramble ensues to save the town, full of riddles and hidden clues.<br />Ben and Ned (the dog) are a delightful duo, well-balanced and sympathetic. Jacques' writing style is smooth and polished, his well-loved formula of good vs. evil as present as ever, even if Ben isn't a walking mouse with a sword.<br />With delightful dry wit and a supernatural thread running through the prose, Jacques steps outside his series. As well-beloved (and still fresh) as the Redwall books are, hopefully he will write more books in this vein.	2001-04-02

I'm not certain why so many people classify it as a kids' fantasy book -- look at the bottom of the page, where it says &quot;Fantasy - General.&quot; Perhaps it's the plot similarity to such books as &quot;Dark is Rising.&quot;<br />The sixteen-year-old heroine, Fern, is an intelligent and grounded young woman who is staying with her brother, while her father is off in the US. Also staying there with Fern and Will is Alison, a woman who might be a witch...<br />Strange occurrances crop up around the old house, and a hermit called the &quot;Watcher&quot; warns Fern of Alison's intentions. Alison is searching for the Key to the sunken city of Atlantis, that would allow a living mortal to enter death -- without dying him/herself. Fern has a strange power from Atlantean heritage, that allows her to search for the Key - and to combat Alison/Alimond, and a man named Javier Holt. What follows is a very intriguing quest for Atlantis.<br />I found that Siegal's prose sometimes got a bit overwrought and overdetailed, though it had some truly beautiful imagery. And she managed to keep the much-drawn-on idea of Atlantis from becoming yet another seen-that-done-that tale. Unfortunately, the last third dragged a bit and the climax was rather... sputtery. It could have used more work.<br />What I didn't like was the idea of a 16-year-old making love to an older man on a beach. The language was not explicit or tawdry, it was very poetic in fact. However, the idea of it is rather icky in itself, and I found the romance factor irrelevent and distracting.<br />It's a pretty good book, hardly the best I've seen. But it is definitely worth a read.	2001-04-01

It was the only JDM bio there. Now I see why. I did not like this book.<br />This book chronicles Jim Douglas Morrison's life from childhood to his early death, of his meteoric rise to fame and nationwide adoration. The problem is that it gives us little of Jim Morrison below stereotypes and surface.<br />Jim is portrayed primarily as a drunk and a jerk who did drugs and used people and so forth. A more disturbing detail is that the more positive aspects of his life are covered in as little time as possible. We are given plenty of detail as to the nasty breakups with his high-school girlfriend, his argument with Patricia Kennealy-Morrison prior to her abortion, any semi-obscene gesture or word, and his brutal treatment of a one-night stand. Yet we are given virtually no information on his poetry and feelings about that, any brighter shades to his romantic relationships with aforementioned Kennealy-Morrison or Pamela Courson, or indeed of any friends he truly had.<br />Yet, despite the constant coverage of rockstar-badboy antics, Hopkins and Sugarman give him an embarrassing level of adulation. (I could easily psychoanalyze here, but I think I shall not) Had Morrison truly been as they wrote him here, I couldn't imagine anyone being devoted to him.<br />Adding bad to &quot;verse,&quot; the writing style is so choppy and bloated at times that I found this book painful to read. It is also uneven: There is a pretty high level of detail throughout much of the book, and then three quarters through it speeds up and dumps the detail. (Did the editor die?)<br />Like &quot;Wild Child,&quot; I cannot recommend this book. I advise you to read &quot;Break On Through,&quot; which is a far more fluid and balanced account of Jim Morrison's life and death.	2001-03-21
2061441:US	50881246	REJDBGSZ1CWJJ	1560252499	665567084	Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison	Books	2	34	41	N	Y	Great book... for fiction...	As a biography, I give it no stars. As a work of fiction, I give it four. That evens out to two.<br />This book chronicles the love affair of Jim Morrison and Linda Ashcroft, rock star and anonymous woman. The read is romantic and beautiful... too bad it's apparently fiction. Ashcroft offers a book that is, sadly, a pack of either lies or delusion.<br />Her book's very core conflicts with and flatly contradicts the dual relationships with Pamela Coursen and Patricia Kennealy-Morrison, one of whom extra-legally married to him - a proven testimony that would conflict with Ashcroft's claim that Jim was planning to marry her. She gives no specific dates or landmarks in Jim's life, making vague references to concerts and such events - no one still living (or un-brain-burned) had apparently seen the two together. Supposed thefts deprived her of the alleged material documenting her relationship with Jim.<br />Smells funny, no? Pamela Coursen had many, many witnesses that she was Jim's lover, testimonies from many people. Patricia Kennealy-Morrison has signed documentation alongside testimonies (though fewer than Pamela) that she had a relationship and extra-legal marriage with Jim Morrison. Ashcroft's utter lack of either documentation or witnesses adds to the funny smell, even if you disbelieve all that we know of either woman in Jim's life.<br />As a novel, this book reads well. Sweet and romantic, with an excellent writing style and a pleasant flow. But I found it highly distracting that the author wrote this as a biography, and that I knew that none of this was true. Also, some of the things that Jim allegedly said to her disturbed me, and made me wonder why she would put such things down about/by Jim if she supposedly loved him.<br />If you truly wish to know more about Jim Morrison and women who loved him, I advise you to read both &quot;Strange Days&quot; and &quot;Angels Dance, Angels Die,&quot; one about his relationship to Patricia Kennealy-Morrison and one about his relationship to Pamela Coursen. I cannot recommend this as a biography.his relationship to Pamela Coursen. I cannot recommend this as a biography.	2001-03-21

If you don't mind a volume that is twisted and sick in a way that will make you laugh out loud, then by all means scootle to buy this!	2001-03-19
2115712:US	50881246	R3QNILT3NW0G1	0743410017	162515751	The Steps up the Chimney (Maghousquar Series Number 1)	Books	3	3	5	N	N	A flawed entry	This book is something of a mixed bag, combining good suspense with uneven pacing and description. There were also a few threads that were, honestly, not necessary in this book.<br />Three kids, in the manner of Alan Garner's books, are sent to their uncle's peculiar mansion, an old house with strange animals creeping nearby and a series of steps going up the chimney. Tension is rampant in the house, as Uncle Jack and his live-in, vegetarian girlfriend Phoebe are having a baby and are not married. At the same time, a mysterious, magical man named Steven Tyler is lurking near the house with designs on the people inside...<br />Though the suspense in this book is pretty good, it often slams to a halt rather than building to a climax. The descriptive language when talking about nature and the outdoors is wonderful, but unfortunately we never get clear pictures of the characters or the inside of Golden House.<br />I found that the whole subplot with Phoebe and Jack to be rather unnecessary, and an item that some parents may not want their kids to read about, as both characters believe that there's nothing unusual about cohabitation and single motherhood. It's a mature matter that somehow was jarring in with the innocent &quot;children on holiday encounter magic&quot; plotline. I also found it distracting that the girls spend so much time suspecting that Phoebe is a witch, then simply drop the matter when she has the child.<br />The magician unfortunately lacks the majesty of such wizards as Gandalf, Merlin, Albus Dumbledore... he simply appears, talks, then vanishes again. The ending is uneven, as we have one climax, and immediately switch to another.<br />This book appeared to need some editing, but is overall an interesting story.	2001-02-04

Small kids will be delighted by the opportunity to find all of them, though parents may have to describe what the difference between a lobster and a crawfish is.<br />Humans don't really exist in this book, as animals seem to rule. The actions of the animals - such as aforementioned lions pawing lazily through books - seem very logical in this dreamy world. Even if you don't have kids or they are too old for picture books, check this out anyway. Excellence like this is not restricted to age.	2001-01-17

One of the classic kids' fantasy, and rightly so. But, like so many literary masterpieces, this book will be passed over by adults who do not think that mystical adventures involving preteens can possibly be good. Hah. This series is more complex and moving than most adult fantasy.<br />This series, unlike other fantasy series like Jedi Apprentice or Harry Potter, and like the Narnia series, does not have the same cast throughout the series - we have two separate ones, the Drews and the Old One named Will. These two are linked by the mysterious Merriman and the otherworldly battle against the forces of evil, called simply &quot;The Dark.&quot; One book won a Newbery and another was nominated.<br />The first book, &quot;Over Sea, Over Stone,&quot; introduces us to the Drews (somewhat like the kids in E. Nesbit's books), English kids on vacation who uncover ancient relics and get swept up in the battle with the Dark. <br />&quot;The Dark Is Rising,&quot; perhaps the best of the series, is the chronicle of young Will Stanton, a boy who discovers that he is different, special. He is the last of the immortal Old Ones, who work against the Dark, and is sent on a time-tripping, fast-paced adventure that leaves him a different person.<br />&quot;The Greenwitch&quot; is the relatively slender book that ties the two previous ones together, the meeting of Will and the Drews, as they search for an ancient Grail that is being pursued by the Dark.<br />&quot;The Grey King&quot; involves Will becoming ill and losing some of his memory. But soon he encounters a boy and his dog - who can see wind. The &quot;golden harp&quot; mentioned in a previous book is used in this, to awaken special men for the battle with the Dark.<br />&quot;Silver on the Tree&quot; is the last book of the series, the dramatic climax that concludes the story of Will, Bran, and the Drews as the Dark makes its final assault on the world.<br />Though traditional good-wins-over-evil scenarios are shown in this series, one should keep in mind that very little comes without a price. Will, for example, gains knowledge and power upon learning that he is one of the Old Ones, but he loses his world-bound innocence in the process. It also shows how seductive evil, in the form of the old tramp in the second book, can be even to a good person, how pride can bring us down. Redemption also has its place in these books, as in the works of JRR Tolkien.<br />Cooper is at her peak in this, weaving Celtic lore with 20th century characters seamlessly like Alan Garner. Her writing jolts a response from the reader, in such scenes as the rooks attacking people, detailed but not too much (well, a little in a few places)<br />To any and all readers of Harry Potter, kids' fiction, or just someone who isn't reading at the moment: Buy this series. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. (And Seaward is pretty cool also)	2001-01-17

Richard Paul Evans, who has never pretended that he is the next Tolstoy, pens an excellent novel that tugs at the heartstrings, with traditional values and characters. (So they can't stand him. His success speaks otherwise about his skills)<br />Departing from the Christmas Box trilogy, Evans has clearly altered his style a bit in &quot;Locket.&quot; The dialogue flows a bit more easily, and the descriptions are more thorough. The main character, Michael, is an impoverished young man whose mother has just died, and who figures that it's just a matter of time until his wealthy, beautiful girlfriend Faye dumps him like a ton of bricks. Her father, additionally, is opposed to her marrying anything other than a guy with five limos and an army of servants in their lush mansion.<br />So Michael takes a job at a local nursing home, and befriends an elderly lady named Esther, who lives half in her tragic past, longing for a man she &quot;let get away.&quot; Esther's journey is tangled with Michael's, especially when he is accused of beating an old man to death and risks losing Faye.<br />Michael is... well, indescribable. He's perfect without being annoying, because he had to suffer to gain it. Faye manages to rise above being just another rich girlfriend, by informing her boyfriend just what she wants out of her life. Esther is almost beyond human, like someone who has one foot in heaven already.<br />There are hints of violence, though none is actually shown, and pretty much no profanity in this. There is an attempted seduction, but the gal doesn't get past Michael's shirt. This book is proof positive that gratuitous crud to appeal to the lowest denominator does not need to be inserted for it to be a wonderful piece of work. No sex, no crudity, just a wonderful romance.<br />Though there are peculiar situations (two old woman in wheelchairs duking it out) Evans never plays senility or old people for laughs, but rather with regret that they can be treated callously.<br />The courtroom scenes in an Evans novel gave me pause, as it didn't seem much like &quot;his thing,&quot; but he pulled it off in rare style, very realistically. The scene where Michael stands outside and learns to forgive is one of the most beautiful things I've read in modern fiction.<br />As soon as I can, I'm buying &quot;Carousel,&quot; to hear more about Michael and Faye...ughs, but rather with regret that they can be treated callously.<br />The courtroom scenes in an Evans novel gave me pause, as it didn't seem much like &quot;his thing,&quot; but he pulled it off in rare style, very realistically.

They say you can't judge a book by its cover, but I did for a looooong time (until I found a gorgeous red hardback with gold embossing). I was also somewhat offput by the peeks at dialogue and descriptions. The first ten pages or so are a bit tough to get through, with lush descriptions of the manor, but then the story picks up pace.<br />The unnamed heroine, the second Mrs. de Winter, is first shown to us as a gawky, freaked young girl who befriends Maxim de Winter while accompanying an American woman around. Maxim marries the young woman quickly, but even before they reach his home at Manderly, she feels the eerie spell of Rebecca, Wife No. 1.<br />Adding to the creepy suspense is grim Mrs. Danvers and the staff of Manderly, who dwell on Rebecca as much as if she were still alive. Mrs. de Winter can't even pet the dog or sit in a chair without thinking how &quot;this is what Rebecca did...&quot;<br />Du Maurier's skill is shown in the crafting of a dead woman, not even a ghost or apparition, who nevertheless haunts Manderly and everyone in it. The heroine gains a backbone over the course of the novel, while you start to hate Mrs. Danvers more and more...<br />The prose is lush and visual - often it takes up a few paragraphs when it's a particularly pretty place. You will vividly see the trees around Manderly, the yawnworthy hotel at the beginning, the gardens of the house, the rooms, and so on. The descriptions and characterizations are subtle and beautiful, so that you can almost feel Rebecca there as well.<br />A small warning to anyone who might read the mass-market paperback: It may not be worth it. I checked out several copies and the print was tiny and smudgy.	2001-01-15

Once again Jane Yolen creates a unique fantasy novel that left me reading it a second time. And a third. Not as complex as the &quot;Pit Dragon&quot; trilogy or as eerily poetic as the &quot;Merlin&quot; books, &quot;Boots and the Seven Leaguers&quot; is nonetheless good fun.<br />Gog is an average teen - oh wait, he's also a troll who has trouble with magic. It's just a matter of days before the rock band &quot;Boots and the Seven Leaguers&quot; shows up, and Gog and his friend Pook don't have tickets. The two manage to magic themselves into the concert as roadies - only to lose Gog's younger brother, Magog. The two troll-teens set off to find Magog and encounter such colorful creatures as the Huntsmen, Weed King, and the White Wyrm.<br />The characters are pretty much perfect. Any teen will see themselves in Gog, and his desperation both to find his little brother and to get back in time to see Boots perform. And who didn't have a best friend like Pook?<br />Yolen's writing is as snappily descriptive as ever, managing to be concise while bringing images into the reader's mind. There is, also, a decidedly funny undertone. The viewpoint is just non-human enough to make us see how a troll thinks without losing the reader's interest.<br />A fairly short but wonderfully-done book that I could read over and over.	2001-01-07

It DESERVED a Newbery.<br />Cassie lives in Mississippi during the Great Depression with her family, facing discrimination and racism and simple rotten odds. They attempt to hold on financially and emotionally despite the assaults on their dignity and the way they want to live their lives. Prejudice does not stop them, no matter what the situation. Cassie and her brothers learn about racism and in their learning, learn strength.<br />The writing style is good, dragging you into the story and refusing to let go. In the manner of &quot;Devil's Arithmatic,&quot; this story conveys the horror of racism to kids without being graphic or violent to do so. Mildred Taylor's words carry the emotions to the reader in simplicity rather than relying on emotional manipulation, as many historical books do.<br />Cassie is an excellent character, one who seems devoid of the artificial attitude and cynicism that is in many book characters who face problems such as prejudice. Her parents and brothers are a little more in the background, but also seem very real.<br />This is an excellent book, one worthy of many, many rereadings. All kids should read it!	2000-11-26

Emma Thompson, who wrote the screenplay for the delightful Jane Austen film &quot;Sense and Sensibility,&quot; chose to include journal entries throughout the filming of the movie as well, in addition to the winning entry of a contest to see who could write the best letter from Fanny to Elinor.<br />There is wit in the descriptions and the photos, all well-captured. The journal entries are entertaining and a good look into the making of a movie. Although be forewarned -- because they dress like the characters of S&amp;S, they do not talk like them. There is definitely some verbal crudeness in the book, men and women alike, but if you can overlook that (or are used to it) then this book will be a delightful read for any Jane Austen fan.	2000-11-21

Pray that no one does. Because that is what Moody has done here. This book is trash--pure garbage.<br />Over the course of this book, she carefully mangles the characters so that they are hardly recognizable as the lovable kids who grow into friends in &quot;Secret Garden.&quot; This book is written like a thousand other novels, in style and structure, and might not have been so horrible if she hadn't been using the original author's characters. Dicken, Colin, and Mary bear no resemblance to themselves.<br />I fully agree with Shelly Treadway--Burnett would have done virtually anything to keep something like this from being done with her characters (I know, because I have some of my own). The delightful promise, healing, and hope of &quot;Secret Garden&quot; have been carefully eradicated from this volume.<br />This book is a travesty, and should be universally banned. If you have had the misfortune to read it, I advise you to read the REAL story to clean your psyche and dismiss THIS as published fanfiction.	2000-11-14

As Hollywood prepares to unleash yet another dreary, mangled version of a classic book, I found myself sitting down to read &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; yet again.<br />The Grinch, for no apparent reason, REALLY hates Christmas and the Whos of Whoville love it. Angered by their holiday festivities and happiness, he plots to steal their presents and decorations, under the assumption that Christmas can't/won't exist without them. So he sets off with faithful but much-kicked canine Max to destroy Christmas. But is Christmas only presents and ornaments?<br />Dr. Seuss's delightfully-skewed rhymes and names are as enjoyable as ever, making the important message of Christmas infinitely more palatable than if it had been a much-regurgitated, cliched book. I admit it--at the beginning the Christmas season I tend to act Grinchish, and I felt much better after reading this book...<br />If you like this book, then check out the old cartoon special (though not the live-action one). &quot;Grinch&quot; is a treasure in kid's literature and can be enjoyed by anyone...	2000-11-13

Everyone who'd be interested in a collector's edition will already know the story, so I'm not going to bother with a plot summary. This book is seriously overpriced for what it costs to actually produce it--but then, they're milking wallets like crazy.<br />I found that the leather binding was rather funny-looking, the illustration had somehow been altered in a way that was VERY unappealing, and the picture of Harry by Rowling somehow... uh... it just didn't make me feel any less odd about it. I don't have a problem with, say, the leather-bound LOTR volume because they bothered to make it more worth the money.<br />I'd advise that either you take the advice of the other reviewer and get it from the UK (where people apparently don't get quite so milked for their merchandise) or buy several paperback copies.

The heroine becomes enmeshed in the politics of the time -- also, she's thought to be a prophet, since she knows their future. Between giving advice, she befriends a young woman named Nannora.<br />The idea of a modern person in ancient times has become a screaming cliche in books and television alike, but every now and then an author pulls it off with style. There were some definitely cringe-worthy passages in this book, but Tara adapts better to the Egyptian life better and more believably than the usual time-traveller.<br />The writing style is a bit stark, but it's certainly not bad. The heroine is basically the average teen, which is also a bit cliched, but her lack of in-your-face attitude saves her from mediocrity.<br />The historical background and intriguing storyline of this book definitely make it worth the while of any kid who stumbles on it.	2000-11-06

Devoid of the cute tricks and talking beasts of many animal-centered books, it is a harsh look at a formerly-pampered dog's lessons on survival among a pack of his fellows.<br />Buck is an ordinary pet dog--until the day he is stolen and sent off to Alaska, in the middle of the goldrush around the turn of the century. Buck learns to cope with the rough lifestyle of a sled dog, competes for survival and status among the other dogs, and makes friends along the way.<br />London's skill is evident, in that he is able to convey Buck's feelings and actions in an understandable way, without dialogue. His treatment, especially right after he is abducted, often makes the reader want to reach through and whomp his attackers. At the same time, you adore John Thornton for loving Buck so much and being kind to him when no other human is.<br />With books such as &quot;White Fang&quot; and &quot;Call of the Wild,&quot; one wonders if Thornton and characters like that were alter-egos for London, since his affection for canines is clear in his writing. I also wonder whether he studied the pack structure of dogs kept together for a long time. And like in real life, there's not a happy ending for all concerned--such as one dog who simply can't keep pulling the sled.<br />Buck changes over the course of the book. The same nobility and strength is still there, but it's tempered with wisdom and experience in wild matters as well as domestic ones.<br />Without overdoing the descriptions, London gives you an idea of the cold bleakness of Alaska when your feet are in the snow and you have to trudge twenty miles. The readers will also find themselves agreeing completely with the brief descriptions of the characters who flit in and out.<br />&quot;Animal that longs to return to the wild&quot; may be a cliche now, but it wasn't then. And now I'm off to read &quot;White Fang&quot;--I hope it's as good as this book was.	2000-10-23

Lysistrata is perhaps my favorite of the Greek plays-it's never pompous or overbearing, and it never overwhelms itself with flowery prose. In addition, it's one of the few Greek plays I've read that portrays women as genuine human beings rather than murderers, decorations, or idiots. They're smart, sexy, and socially aware, especially in a time when they were very seriously repressed.<br />Lysistrata is an intelligent Athenian woman who is sick and tired of the Greek city-states warring against each other. She calls all the women she can round up and comes up with a strategy to end the wars: Keep away from their husbands' beds, and the men will make peace with other cities to make peace with their wives. After a great deal of whining, the women agree to deprive their husbands of sex until peace is achieved. But that's only the beginning of what Lysistrata has planned...<br />Too many feminist tales end up being heavy-handed-though women are on the side of peace and right in this, it doesn't bang you over the head. The men are human as well. The comedy is sly and witty (though full of mild sex talk--nothing too raunchy) and the scene where one young woman unmercifully teases her love-hungry husband will have you rolling.<br />I can see someone making this into a movie-in modern or ancient settings, the dialogue can still be deciphered without a translation program *wink*. It's a story about the power that women can wield and the lengths that they can go to.<br />Read, laugh, guffaw! You won't regret it!	2000-10-22

And sugary.<br />Princess Quinnella lives in the magical kingdom of Mandria, on the other side of a &quot;wishing pool&quot; *cringes*. However, she ends up going to Earth on the other side of the pool, and naturally (as she's required to do the usual oppressive royal duties in her own world) she wants to stay.<br />Not much of a plot. The plot is also saturated with fluffy sugariness that kind of repelled me. It was interesting until the LOOOOOOOVE story. The heroine, while nice enough, doesn't really seem like the kind of person who would have the guts to wander around a strange world.<br />The writing style is so-so-I sort of got the impression that the author wasn't throwing her heart and soul into the crafting of this tale, and thus it really doesn't have enough intensity to really make it stick in the mind of the viewer. Even a simple, straight-forward tale such as the &quot;Book of Three&quot; can be written in such a way if the author is dedicated enough to the storytelling.<br />If you want a clean fantasy romance without darkness and twists, then try this book. If you don't, and want grayer shades to your characters, then read some other book, like Sabriel.	2000-10-18

I'm a relatively new fan of Fawlty Towers, and I think it's the funniest comedy ever written! This book (in a relatively small tome) encompasses the relatively short series's episodes in script form.<br />This also solves the problem of lines that we couldn't hear. Sometimes, when watching Fawlty Towers, one can't hear the actor say the line, or the laugh track drowns it out (or, very occasionally, Manuel says something weird). This book allows you to check out the lines.<br />In addition to that, it's almost as funny on paper as it is on the screen! All it's missing is some way of accurately describing John Cleese's physical humor!	2000-10-17

This book was sadly out-of-print for many years, but was brought back just recently. That's good, because quite honestly Star Trek books tend to follow a specific formula: crew arrives on planet, encounters problem, fixes problem, lives happily ever after. This book takes a weirder outlook... it's more what people would write for fanfiction than an actual novel, which is a darn shame!<br />Dilithium is valuable--you find that out within a short amount of time. And when amazing deposits of it are found on the relatively-advanced planet Direidi (Dee-RYE-dee) both a Klingon cruiser and the USS Enterprise are sent there to stake a claim. But the inhabitants of the planet are apparently going to have some fun with our heroes...<br />Frankly the summary sounds a bit dry, but this book is anything but. Combine a neurotic Vulcan, a crazy computer, an inflatable starship, a princess in love, peppermint Vulcan milkshakes, Kirk fending off a Klingon with soda-water, blue grits, and a lot of weird songs. And the climax is to DIE for. It's goofy, but it's fun.<br />If you insist on the characters rigidly adhering to what you see on the show, then you will hate this book. If you're willing to see them loosen up, dance and sing, and get involved in madcap adventures, then you will love this book!	2000-10-17

I loved the book &quot;Ella Enchanted,&quot; which had a strong female heroine who was still funny and friendly, and dollops of magic, both in the writing and the plot. Same with the movie &quot;Ever After.&quot;<br />&quot;Just Ella,&quot; however, reeks. Perhaps it's not coincidence that almost ALL of the book reviewers thought it was great.<br />Rather than a retelling, this tells what happens as soon as Ella is to-be-married to the Prince. Perhaps the book would have been better if the other characters weren't caricatures, and Ella weren't (as &quot;Virginia US&quot; put it) a cocky feminist. I agree: Why can't there be a strong, smart woman who doesn't feel the need to get up on a soapbox every four minutes, and WANTS to be a princess?<br />Even the &quot;I am woman, hear me roar&quot; attitude might have been tolerable if the other characters weren't so obvious! Charming, being a handsome member of the upper-class, is an airhead. Jed, being of the lower classes and having to work, is of course a wonderful person (And a social activist? Will someone gag me with a glass slipper?)<br />Madame Bisset is sexist, repressed by sexism, happy about it, and wants to boot everyone else into her mindset--she's ridiculous (she says that women are like flowers, to be viewed in beauty. Riiiight, like everyone in the upper crust at that time thought that). Simply ridiculous. All of them have the depth of construction paper, and it only serves to add to the impression that Ella herself is nothing but a veil of sarcasm.<br />Apparently Ms. Haddix tried to slide in on the success of &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; without the most important factor: The fact that Ella of EE loved her prince for who he was, and he loved her for who she was. (Ditto with Danielle in &quot;Ever After&quot;). Instead, she mutilated the character to make her a protest against... well, just about everything in fairy tales that we love so much.<br />This book is devoid of magic--one gets the feeling that it was written half-heartedly. The heroine is snobby and the supporting characters are stupid. And the ending should be chopped out and rewritten, it was so bad.<br />As I said at the beginning, watch &quot;Ever After&quot; or read &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; for magic and beauty and love and a happily-ever-after that you can really believe.much.<br />This book is devoid of magic--one gets the feeling that it was written half-heartedly.

It's more than just good Trek--it's good SF. This book fleshes out the Vulcans as a whole, past and present, bringing back old favorites and a slew of great new ones.<br />Interspersed with the history of Vulcan, from the earliest stages of their unified culture to the birth of Spock, is shown. Even though the characters only appear for one chapter (with one or two exceptions), we can identify with them. In the ghastly, murderous feuds of one chapter and the often calculating violence, the Vulcans appear like Romulans in the past. At the same time, we see them growing more and more civilized. I even found the &quot;cave-Vulcan&quot; chapter appealing, making me wonder what the Vulcans would have been like if their planet had been lush.<br />In the present, the Enterprise crew is drawn into a planetary conspiracy when a bunch of yahoo Vulcans decide that they want to secede from the Federation--and Our Heroes must get to the bottom of it, while making speeches. This part could have been solidly ordinary, but is saved by the fact that not only are the greatest SF trio in history at their funniest, but also it is populated by a motley crew of bizarre aliens in Starfleet, such as giant snowflakes and enormous dragon-creatures.<br />The Vulcans themselves are also fleshed out: We get to see more of them than in &quot;Amok Time,&quot; and a wider range of them, from farmers to redheads to the Zen guy that ended up being bitten on the leg. We see Sarek, Amanda, T'Pau, and a few Vulcans (one familiar) that you will LOVE to hate. Be sure to check out Kirk's scene in the pub.<br />One interesting detail: Duane wrote in the Enterprise having what is essentially a posting board, before there were posting boards (I think). Good job keeping the future here, Ms. Duane!<br />If you love people with pointy ears and bowl haircuts, read this book. Oh, and &quot;I want popcorn!&quot;	2000-10-07

Biting and sly, he pokes fun at many of the greatest people in history.<br />He starts in ancient Egypt and quickly works his way through to Greece, the Middle Ages, on and on throughout the ages without a single dull spot. He is less outright-laugh-inducing than such comedians as Dave Barry or Gene Weingarten; rather, his wit is more likely to elicit snickers and &quot;hee hee&quot;s rather than belly laughs.<br />Perhaps the only flaw in this glorious work of humor is that sadly, Cuppy never finished it. Never has the world history been so wonderfully and unstuffily written. A wonderful book!	2000-10-04

And the third &quot;Sketchbook&quot; just came out!<br />The absence of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; left a hole in the witty humor department for a very long time (the WP newspaper has replaced it with the abysmal &quot;Boondocks&quot;) but Zits has an almost eerie similarity to it in structure--as well as the fact that Jeremy has a remarkable resemblance to a six-foot-tall Calvin. It's &quot;Calvin: The Teen Years.&quot;<br />Jeremy Duncan is a fifteen-year-old boy who lives in an average home in the suburbs. He tolerates his out-of-it-but-smart parents Walt and Connie, secretly longs for the unattainable Sarah (think of Susie at fifteen), and hangs out with best friend Hector (Hobbes has morphed into a Hispanic high-schooler with more wisdom than Jeremy can ever have).<br />Jeremy is such an &quot;ordinary&quot; teenager that it's astounding. He longs to be dangerous and edgy, but only makes himself look weird in the process. His schemes and daydreams are funny and very realistic. Hector is the best friend we all want--he's wise, funny, interesting, and against his better judgement he always goes along with Jeremy.<br />But this isn't a joke at the expense of the parents: Walt and Connie are almost as funny as their son. Though he thinks they are clownish pains, they are actually much smarter than he gives them credit for. &quot;Un-chill&quot; and passe, Connie has a biting wit and Walt a quiet wit. Parents will definitely sympathize.<br />If you're an adult, you'll be transported back to your teenage years. If you're a teen, you'll nod in agreement.	2000-09-24

Why? Because I am STILL sifting through both sides.<br />Ms. Keneally-Morrison chronicles (in a hefty tome) her romance and pagan marriage to Jim Morrison, a major rock star who died in Paris of a drug overdose, with his other girlfriend Pamela. She goes over the course of a few years, starting with her critical review of his work and ending... well, long after he died.<br />Problems: Well, one is that Ms. Keneally-Morrison appears to have a bit of a persecution complex. She compares moviemaker Oliver Stone to Satan and doesn't hesitate to lambast those she dislikes. In addition, I found it distracting that she keeps bringing up her religion, her intelligence, her inner strength, and so on in portions of the book that it doesn't belong in. A leetle defensive?<br />On the flip side, I do not believe she did this for the money. I think she did it for love, but unfortunately I think that she's become... well, obsessive is the right word for it, both about Morrison's memory and defending herself against any critics/dislikers, and sometimes against loyal fans (this was quite disturbing). She even goes to the extreme length of writing a work of fiction very strongly based on her outlook on the relationship with Morrison.<br />I really know almost nothing about Pamela--but from the sound of what I've heard, she was very much in love with Morrison, and hardly the demon incarnate that Keneally-Morrison seems to see her as. For instance, she criticizes Pamela's drug usage, but how many did she, personally, use herself?<br />Jim himself is... is... is... well, he doesn't sound like the guy the rest of us have heard of. He doesn't seem to be the same person in this book, in speech or manners or attitude--I think the outlook is rosied, significantly. Shy? <br />I was also very disturbed by an admission Ms. Keneally-Morrison made on her website: that she put little verbal traps throughout the book, so that her detractors would say &quot;AHA!&quot; when they saw them, then be let down with a crash. I was also a little creeped out by a self-interview she gives herself at the end of the book...<br />Since Pamela never wrote a book, I can't tell what her personality was like, except by the claims of people who knew her, which is admittedly easier to believe than the lone POV of Ms. Keneally-Morrison. For both sides of the issue, I advise that you also read &quot;Angels Dance and Angels Die,&quot; a very sad and sweet book. In the meantime, I hope that Ms. Keneally-Morrison can be counseled and find peace despite her past unhappiness.	2000-09-23

Well, &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot; traversed a mile of the journey with a single bound.<br />After &quot;Castle of Llyr,&quot; we know that Taran is pretty obviously bonkers-in-love with Eilonwy, but since he's an Assistant Pig-Keeper and a Princess, he doesn't plan to ask her until he can discern who he is, in terms of rank and birth (she'd probably think he was nuts to think this, and make some amusing comparison, but she sadly doesn't appear in person in this one--warning to Eilonwy fans).<br />Taran first travels to the Marsh of Morva to ask for advice, then sets out on his journey with Gurgi, who shows the levels of his faithfulness in this story. He comes face-to-face with amorality, selfishness, greed, and various other human failings. But Taran manages to handle them all with grace and wisdom...<br />... until he meets a crippled shepherd who might just be his father.<br />After he meets the shepherd, Taran's journey becomes far more mature. He is forced to face his own failings and his own beliefs about whether he would be worthy for Eilonwy, as he tries to change his life. Is Taran a prince? Or a prince among men? And which matters more?<br />Such favorites as King Smoit (a personal fave of mine--his last scene with Taran is wonderful), Doli of the Fair Folk, and Fflewddur Fflam appear in this book, but it's really Taran's story, with a good dose of Gurgi thrown in.<br />This takes all but one step toward adulthood--the last step is taken in &quot;High King.&quot; Taran is one of the most unique and sometimes haunted heroes in fantasy literature, for children or adults. His journey of self-discovery is amazing, truly amazing.<br />Why this book never won a Newbery is beyond me--it doesn't have a lot of swords clashing or involved battles. It's a journey of the heart, and possibly one of the finest books I've ever read.	2000-09-22

I really wish it had been longer, because of the excellent nature of the material, but at least it's got gorgeous paper and cover art.<br />It follows the story of a few wizards, including Tomorrow Wizard (yes, that's his name) and his apprentice Murdoch. The two couldn't be more different--Murdoch doesn't just want to help humans, he wants to BE human.<br />It's a beautiful little story with enjoyable characters--the grumpy wizard thing is a bit overdone, but McLachlan manages to make it fresh and enjoyable. Murdoch is a delightful character. Both are written well, their dialogue sticking very well to their personalities.<br />Frankly, even without the story, I think I would have bought it alone for the cover art. It's expertly done and well-colored, so be sure to savor it.<br />This is a sweet (if short) read for fantasy buffs, especially those of you who love wizard stories.	2000-09-22

Did I mention I put off reading this book for ages because I didn't want the story to end?<br />&quot;High King&quot; is the most mature of all of the books, a hard story that ends bittersweetly. The sword Dyrnwyn has been stolen by the shapeshifting Arawn Deathlord, and the various cantrevs (kingdoms) of Prydain are launching a military strike against Annuvin, The Land of Death.<br />A scarred Taran and his friends set out on their most dangerous journey, along with the broken sorceress Achren, who wants to get back at Arawn. The end is sad but somehow necessary, though it's a bit reminiscent of the &quot;Gray Havens&quot; scene in LOTR.<br />Taran is no longer the naive boy we see in &quot;Book of Three.&quot; Having had plenty of adventure, the events of this book end his adolescence and starts his adulthood, as a strong man. Eilonwy is a bit less twittery in this book, after her adventures and training in the Isle of Mona. Gurgi and Fflewddur are... well, themselves, as is Gwydion. Dallben is perhaps the most changed in Taran's view--in TBOT he was seen as a finicky old man, while here he is the great enchanter we always knew he was.<br />Other characters, such as the lovable bear King Smoit and the great warrior Gwydion. There are some character moments that, I promise, will wrench tears from you.<br />Those of you who are put off by the old-style language of &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot; or extensive battle scenes, be forewarned: There are plenty in this. But it's to be expected in the final chapter of an epic saga, that you'll never want to end.<br />&quot;Chronicles&quot; is, after &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; my favorite fantasy series, and the High King won a Newbery for a reason. Read, and enjoy...	2000-09-22

He crafts a novel that manages to be suspenseful, funny, dramatic, touching, funny, sweet, romantic, funny... frankly this is better than most prescripted suspense books, most of which meld together into a bland glob.<br />The story takes place in Miami, following the intertwined lives of many lowlife crudballs, teenagers, and ordinary businessmen. Oh--there's also an unpronounceable European country that is giving one one of the characters a nuclear bomb, which is promptly... oh, never mind. This plot is remarkably complex, much more complex than I expected Barry's book to be, and it's too complex for me to summarize properly.<br />Those who are expecting a novelized composite of Barry's columns will be disappointed. Oh, there are DEFINITELY tangs of those columns, such as the stupid dog and hallucinagenic toad. Some of the situations are so ludicrous (&quot;It's a SQUIRT gun!&quot;) that you'll roar with laughter. And Barry does an admirable job of tying up loose ends, making for a compact and enjoyable novel.<br />And there's remarkably clean &quot;trooluv.&quot; The only real sexiness is a lascivious henchman, and the rest is shy teenagers, middle-aged divorcees, and a lovable homeless man who meets the woman of his dreams. However, you shouldn't let your kiddies (as Barry warns in the first part) read this book, as it has some sexual references and many bad words. (Ought to be okay for the average teen, though)<br />This book isn't particularly deep or original, but it's written with a funny spin that makes it the best book I've read this summer. It'd make a better-than-usual comedy movie! For Barry fans, this is a MUST-READ!	2000-09-21

Many years  later, at an English-esque boarding school, Sabriel must take up her  father's magical sword and bells and try to find out what has happened to  him. To do so, she must leave her relatively high-tech home for the Old  Kingdom, where magic rules and evil things are stalking her.<br />Along the  way, she is accompanied by the guard Touchstone and the menacing/funny  cat-spirit Mogget. They must try to defeat the evil Kerrigor, who wants to  blast the Charter which keeps all things from descending into  evil.<br />Sabriel is the best fantasy hero I've read about since Lord of the  Rings. Too many fantasy heroines are either damsels or warrior  women--Sabriel is neither. She acts and thinks precisely like a young woman  in her position. Strong, intriguing, and no slack with a sword in a bad  situation, she is a wonderful role model.<br />Touchstone is a darling, but  Mogget really is unique. Is he evil? Good? Or some peculiar mix? This  ancient spirit forced to live as a cat is enslaved to the Abhorsen family  for the good of everyone (we get a glimpse of how dangerous he is). The  world that Garth Nix dreamed up, a mixture of Tolkien and WW2 England, is  unparalleled in the fantasy genre. It's populated by animated ghouls,  ghastly Mordicants, the almost-human sendings, Charter ghosts, the  inhabitants of the river of Death, where only Abhorsens go, and so on...<br />His writing style is lush and hypnotic--you can actually see the events  unfolding in front of your eyes, in this wintry but inviting world.<br />Thankfully, Mr. Nix appears to be writing a pair of sequels--I can  hardly wait. Anyone else think this should be made into a movie?else think this should be made into a movie?<br />	2000-09-20

Martha Finley's first drippy novel is really that bad. Even as a child, I recognized that this book was a spectacular stinker of the worst kind, focusing on a sugary little Pollyanna with an Electra complex and how her abusive father torments her. It's a terrifyingly puritanical little world where your piety is determined by how many times a day you mention Jesus.<br /><br />Elsie Dinsmore lives with her paternal grandparents and their six children, until the day her father Horace returns to the US. She's delighted that the father who abandoned her and has never even spoken to her has come to see her, because... okay, I'm not sure why she's delighted. But she's horrified to discover that her dad is... not a Christian! OH HORRORS!<br /><br />How do we know he's a Christian? He does fun things on Sundays, reads the newspaper and talks about stuff OTHER than religion with his friends. Case closed!<br /><br />He's also abusive by any era's standards, setting out to break Elsie's religious beliefs by punishing her for them, and pouncing on any opportunity to make her miserable. But she sets out to win his affections by putting up with his constant emotional and physical abuse, even as she dazzles everyone around her by constantly name-dropping Jesus.<br /><br />\\"Elsie Dinsmore\\" is one of those books classified as \\"wholesome.\\" It has no references to anything parents might find even vaguely objectionable... except, you know, telling children that they should happily accept whatever horrible abuse their parents shell out, and that they should live obsessively strict lives shunning anything \\"worldly\\" like newspapers, friends, fun, clothes, etc.<br /><br />This is not the Christianity of people like C.S. Lewis, who knew how to have a good time. This is a puritanical breed that tries to stamp out any kind of \\"worldly\\" knowledge or fun, and so it ends up being stuffy, repressive and incredibly anti-intellectual.<br /><br />The biggest problem: Elsie herself. She's a prissy, prudish, possibly bipolar little killjoy who is pathologically obsessed with being \\"good\\" all the time. It's impossible to like or sympathize with this spineless little twerp, especially since she takes the antifeministic tack of blaming herself for any actions of her father's. Her unquestioning worship of her abusive father is just frightening, not inspiring.<br /><br />And her daughterly devotion to her dad borders on an Electra complex, with eroticized rants about how much she wants to touch him. This is only reinforced by the fact that one of her closest friends in this story is her father's best buddy... and her future husband.

Well, things have definitely changed in the world of Jude Watson's JA series.<br />After the important events of two books ago, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon  are far closer and more secure. They are being sent to the worlds of Rutan  (high-tech and rather arrogant) and Senali (low-tech and  at-one-with-nature). A tradition dictates that the two sovereigns of these  planets exchange their children at a young age, for the sake of relations  between them. Except now Prince Leed of the Rutan doesn't wanna go  home.<br />His father is furious, and wants the Jedi to intervene. But what  can they do when a young man makes a mature decision that could lead to  war?<br />After the events of &quot;Defenders of the Dead,&quot; I thought  that she was inaccurately portraying the young Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi--but  instead she used this to make Obi-Wan mature in matters of patience and  thoughtfulness. Qui-Gon gets teased a bit about being imperfect, but this  is very good to read. I was genuinely surprised by the end twist--I didn't  see that coming at ALL.<br />I thought the Rutan and Senali lifestyles were a  bit too cliched and the ending a bit too easy for all concerned, but if  everything were truly realistic the conflict would go on for hundreds of  pages. In addition, the writing is an excellent example of poetic prose,  even if Leed tends to repeat himself. I think Ms. Watson is definitely  maturing further as a writer.<br />This is a highly enjoyable entry in a great  series. If you're a fan of Obi-Wan, check it out.	2000-09-18

I've read the old &quot;classic books&quot; and  I treasure my TPM book. Now, finally they've churned out a good one!<br />It  follows the Jedi Knight Ki-Adi-Mundi from the planet Cerea, who has some  definite differences to other Jedi Knights: for instance, he has multiple  wives and daughters. (Some of the scenes make me wonder if that's why some  Jedi don't marry) This isn't all that's occupying Ki-Adi's very tall  brain--a rebellious bunch are stirring on Cerea, and the treacherous Trade  Federation from TPM is included in the mix.  Worst of all, his daughter is  swept up as well.<br />This particular author managed to create an unusually  enjoyable adventure--action and character development (Ki-Adi and his  bond-wife and daughter) are balanced very well. The drawings are slightly  sub-par, but I'm willing to overlook that as some of the previous comic  book stories have been rather grimly drawn.<br />It's not a lost chapter in  the SW saga, but it is an enjoyable story that gives you the writer's  insight into an important Council member. Wonderful!	2000-09-17

The artwork is actually  pleasant to look at--I found myself savoring the images. Yes, Luke and  Vader do a few things that are out-of-character, but book writers have done  worse to Luke (poor Luke... poor poor Luke!).<br />It's a fairly simple story  on the surface, a fairly light story with little of the unrelenting misery  that is sprawled throughout the bloated stories that fill the SW comics.  This one is fresh, new, enjoyable, and has the added bonus of being drawn  in a manner that is highly reminiscent of SW itself, colorful and  pleasant.<br />It's not the greatest story ever written, but it sure is better  than most! If you like Vader and/or Luke, be sure to check this comic out!	2000-09-17

But when Poppy and her boyfriend  Ragweed sneak outside one night, Ragweed is eaten by Mr. Ocax--and no other  mouse seems upset by the news!<br />Upset by this and unable to convince her  family that Mr. Ocax has been lying to them and wants to eat them, Poppy  sets out on a quest to find a place away from Mr. Ocax. Along the way, she  must brave the dangers of the forest and the owl, as well as making a  valuable new friend in the porcupine Ereth, who is the only one who  intimidates Mr. Ocax.<br />Poppy is an admirable and gutsy heroine, willing to  take matters into her own hands (or should I say, paws) rather than risk  her family. Though she is (obviously) a mouse, she's a character that  readers will be able to identify with. It's thoroughly enjoyable to read  about her ascent from a cowed, uneasy mouse to one that can face down a  giant owl.<br />Ereth is perhaps the most original of Avi's characters--I'm  highly pleased to discover that Avi has written a book about him. Prickly  and irritable, he is nonetheless a loyal friend and a funny character  without becoming &quot;comic relief.&quot;<br />A funny, sweet, saddening, and  ultimately happy tale, Poppy is a fun little tale for a cool day. And if  you want to see more of these characters, be sure to check out the other  stories in this series.	2000-09-14

Because of the eerie  scenery, this may not appeal to some Harry Potter-type readers.<br />Nita is a  very ordinary kid who is constantly kicked around by the snobby local  bullies. To escape them, she heads for the library, and finds a book called  &quot;So You Want To Be a Wizard.&quot; Thinking it's a joke, Nita checks  out the book and goes home to read it. Within days, she's and her new  friend Kit are both wizards, and off on a genuinely frightening adventure,  to where trees tell stories and cars rove like packs of wolves.<br />Perhaps  the best character is a tiny white hole nicknamed Fred.  The funniest scene  in the book is when he gets the hiccups...<br />Manhatten never seemed to be  appealing until I read this book, where it hides an alternate world that  cannot be described in one of these reviews. Also hidden away is a demonic  villain whose evil is not evident when you first see him. Fred's  description of him--&quot;starsnuffer&quot;--sounds a bit silly, but it's  accurate.<br />Perhaps the best aspect of this book is that the wizards in it  are not simply wizards because they can and because they want to be. The  wizards have an integral part in keeping the universe ticking,  responsibilities, and pressure to keep doing so. They don't do it for  power--they do it because they are good people. This different view is an  integral part of the book, that makes it stand apart from much of the kid's  fantasy out there.<br />This book cannot be fully absorbed in one  sitting--take the time to savor it, and be sure to reread it. It's that  good!	2000-09-13

Only a few people resist his lottery-style techniques. Obi-Wan  and Qui-Gon must join with them to battle Xanatos, and free Telos from his  influence.<br />Yes, Den has noticeable similarities to Guerra, but hey,  nothing's perfect. Andra is an excellent character, and the climax is  simply stunning.<br />And one enjoyable entry is the fact that Obi-Wan and  Qui-Gon's bond rapidly regenerates itself, after the events of the past few  books. It's a subtle step, but quite noticeable--Qui-Gon had two  apprentices leave him, but only one came back, contrite. If anything, this  makes it more believable that Qui-Gon could believe and trust Obi-Wan in  the future.<br />My only quibble is that the cover artwork has nothing to do  with the contents.

I checked this book out because I am very much into kids' fantasy, and I wanted to read about elves. Unfortunately, I was wrong. FORTUNATELY, I  found a wonderful book.<br />This book is about Hillary, who is jolted from  her comfortable, easy upper-class surroundings by the class oddity, a girl  called Sara-Kate who says that there are elves living in her overgrown  backyard. Even though her snobby parents are clearly uneasy with this new  friendship, Hillary comes to see Sara-Kate--and soon discovers a sad, and  all too realistic, secret that her friend has been keeping.<br />This is not a  fantasy book. Rather, it is the journey of two young girls, one who is  secure, and one who is frightened and alone, but hides it under the guise  of her own little world. It's a sad, sweet story, one that every kid should  check out.	2000-09-08

Stephen Lawhead added his own twists to Arthurian legend, in a Christianity-friendly, mythic-realism retelling of the years leading up to the tales of Arthur and his knights that we know and love. &quot;Taliesin&quot; takes place before the time of Merlin, starring Merlin's parents.<br />Charis is a pampered young princess of Atlantis, a seemingly idyllic civilization reminiscent of Greece. The only jarring note is a blind, seemingly mad prophet who predicts doom will soon fall upon Atlantis, and that the island will sink into the sea. Charis initially doesn't believe him, but upon the sudden, emotionally-scarring death of her mother, she leaves her family and becomes a bull dancer in honor of one of the Atlantean gods. (The scenes where she dances around and over the bull are breathtaking)<br />But a serious injury prompts her and her well-trained team to retire, and she returns home to find her father Avallach seriously ill, and married to his sly-eyed nurse. Charis now has a younger sister, Morgian, a creepy child heavily influenced by the family advisor, whose initially pleasant personality is sinking deeper into melancholy and darkness. And Charis begins to believe: Atlantis is going to sink.<br />Meanwhile, as Charis struggles on Atlantis, a famously unlucky young man in Britain finds a baby caught in a fishnet; he hails this as the beginning of his good luck. When he finds a disgraced wet-nurse for baby Taliesin, he falls in love and marries her; his luck continues. Taliesin grows to manhood, intelligent and wise -- and gifted with strange and wonderful powers.<br />Charis barely escapes Atlantis with her family, arriving on the strange shores of Britain. Though Taliesin's people are hospitable enough, Avallach, Charis and the other &quot;children of Atlantis&quot; are sadly out of place; refined and lovely, in a rough and cold land. Charis is embittered by her many struggles, believing neither in Taliesin's God or in the Atlantean gods. But after he meets her floating in a lake (thus gaining her the title of &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot;) Taliesin falls in love with and eventually converts and marries Charis. Though their time together is far too short, they produce one of the greatest men in history...<br />I'm not entirely certain why it's okay to paganize Arthurian characters, as in &quot;Mists of Avalon,&quot; but it's NOT okay to Christanize them. Why is it that when Christians are shown as better than pagans, it's &quot;sugary&quot; and untrue; but when non-Christians are shown as better than Christians, it's a bold statement and worthy of endless applause?<br />As for historical complaints: it's fiction, for crying out loud! No one knows the &quot;real&quot; story of Arthur, lost in the mists of time. We don't even know if he was a single person, or a collection of mythical and real kings mishmashed together. It's up to authors to interpret and reinterpret. Lawhead never pretends for a moment to be telling anything but a good story. We don't care if there are potatoes and fir trees. It doesn't wreck the book.<br />Writing style is good and descriptive, giving us accurate ideas of the light-filled, rotten-at-the-core Atlantis and the darker, simpler Britain. There is, aside from blood and death and extreme emotional intensity, nothing objectionable about this book in profanity and sex (none of either).<br />Charis is probably one of the best female fictional characters I've ever seen. She's strong and insightful, is willing to take matters into her own hands, and doesn't bow to anyone. It's through her resolve and courage that any people escaped from Atlantis; at the same time, she's afraid and embittered. It takes the sweet, relatively unspoiled Taliesin to break through her shell; Taliesin himself is taken from an old legend, and here reformatted into Merlin's father. Somehow we get more of Charis than Taliesin; though the scene where he brings Merlin back to life is simply breathtaking.<br />This is the start of a beautiful saga, written wonderfully and with great characters. Be sure to read it. Now, on to &quot;Merlin.&quot;rt of a beautiful saga, written wonderfully and with great characters. Be sure to read it. Now, on to &quot;Merlin.&quot;	2000-09-07

I normally hate the sword-and-sorcery epics that go on and on, but I love Brooks' writing style. Plus, let me just say that ever since Tolkien's Legolas, I've had a weakness for elves. (In addition, the cover for this one is simply gorgeous). Okay, so the storyline of the misfits on a ship has been done a million times, the Jerle Shannara manages to be very refreshing in its treatment of them.<br><br>A mutilated elf, found on the sea, is discovered to be an elf prince named Kael Ellessidil who vanished years and years ago on a quest. So, Our Heroes must go off on a journey on an airship, on an expedition to find an ancient, immensely-powerful magic that the elf prince once sought. <br><br>Supposedly the only one capable of reading the map to this magic is Walker Boh, the last Druid - but the heroes have competition, in the form of the beautiful but deadly Ilse Witch. The Ilse Witch is backed up by creepy lizard-creatures, and her shadowy ally the Morgawr-!-and they have every intention of posessing the magic that Walker and his friends are seeking.<br><br>There are new and old characters in this story, and they're all better defined than the average lame-o S&S heroes, as well as being somewhat less cliched. They never quite fall into the trap of \\"Ship of Misfits\\" which is so easy to do under these circumstances.<br><br>Those of you who don't like Mr. Brooks' writing won't like this either, but his style is refreshing steady throughout the Shannara series and he doesn't falter here. A fair amount of description, with excellent pace that some serieses like, say \\"Wheel of Time\\" lack (forever and ever and EVER and nothing happens!).

Most don't actually do it.<br /><br />But when a family patriarch is a malevolent old lecher like Simeon Lee with vast quantities of money, it's no surprise when he ends up dead. Agatha Christie's \\"Hercule Poirot's Christmas\\" is a decidedly unsentimental little Yuletide murder mystery, full of snow-covered manorhouses, gruesome noises and plenty of people who have come for the holidays -- and aren't what they claim to be.<br /><br />As the book opens, a young Spanish girl named Pilar and Stephan Farr from Africa encounter each other on a train, heading for the exact same house -- that of Simeon Lee. Oh yeah, and they both obviously have something to hide.<br /><br />Turns out that old diamond mogul Simeon is gathering his adult children at his house, where the downtrodden Alfred and increasingly fed up Lydia live. Among the kids: stuffy MP George and his slinky wife Magdalene, globe-trotting \\"black sheep\\" Harry, and sensitive mama's boy David and his steadfast wife Hilda. Pilar and Stephen are welcomed with open arms, but  Simeon starts playing mind games with his resentful offspring by revealing the intention of changing his will. That night, the house is roused by a gruesome howl -- and he's found with his throat cut in a locked room.<br /><br />Due to the puzzling nature of the crime and the bizarre evidence, local superintendent Sugden calls in the famed detective Hercule Poirot -- especially since Lee has not only been killed, but his uncut diamonds have been stolen. With his little grey cells, Poirot begins unravelling all the family secrets and lies -- including some surprising facts about Pilar and Stephen. But since the murderer is close at hand, Poirot must solve the seemingly impossible crime before another Yuletide murder happens.<br /><br />Apparently Agatha Christie wrote \\"Hercule Poirot's Christmas\\" for a funny reason -- her brother-in-law complained that her murders were all so clean and bloodless. Ladylike murders tended to be more Christie's forte. So this one is not only bloody, but downright gory -- Simeon gets his throat cut and the whole room is sprayed with blood. You can tell Christie had some fun writing about that, especially with the obligatory quote from the Scottish play: \\"who would have thought the old man had so much blood in him?\\"<br /><br />So even though \\"Hercule Poirot's Christmas\\" has everything a Christmas story should have, it's actually really lacking in festivity -- from the very first scene, we're treated to a Yuletide England that is dark, smoky, grimy and full of barely-hidden resentments and old wounds. Christie sprinkles the plot with plenty of suspense, bizarre clues that aren't easily figured out (especially a rubber scrap that Pilar picks off the floor), and  a plethora of suspects who would have liked to see Simeon cold'n'dead, but who couldn't possibly have gotten inside to do it.<br /><br />And while the investigation is pretty straightforward, it's strewn with some surprising revelations about a couple of the family members. Christie's writing and dialogue tend to be a bit choppy, with many short exclaimations. But her vivid descriptions (London girls are described as \\"smooth egg-shaped faced, scarlet-lipped\\") and tightly coiled plot keep the story chugging along, although the murderer is only moderately hard to figure out.<br /><br />Hercule Poirot comes in when the book is already well underway, and in a way he almost takes a backseat to the other characters. The spawn of Simeon cross a wide range -- the scrappy bad-boy, the whiny mama's boy, the stuffy airbag and the downtrodden guy -- as do their wives, who range from a plain \\"nice woman\\" to a flaky sexpot with a rather shady sexual past. Pilar and Stephen are perhaps the most colorful and least resentful people in the cast -- and Simeon is a nasty, malevolent old tyrant.<br /><br />\\"Hercule Poirot's Christmas\\" is thankfully devoidof sentimental reason-for-the-season dribbling -- it's all about wretchedly dysfunctional families, gruesome murder and the occasional popped balloon.hedly dysfunctional families, gruesome murder and the occasional popped balloon.	2000-09-04

And she wants Poirot to find out the  truth about the murder. So, going by the facts from the man's lover, best  friend, best friend's brother, and the mother's sister, he must deduce who  dunnit.<br />This is so far the only mystery I've ever read where the trail  is cold, and unenhanced by any second murders.

She keeps  her stepchildren (and natural daughter, who is a schizophrenic) dangling  like puppets, doing whatever she says. Lennox, the oldest, has retreated  into mute uncaring, and his wife is threatening to leave him.

Normally I would hate it, but  there's something in the strange eeriness of it all that really made me  read.<br />Determined scientist John Christow is dissatisfied with his  life--he has a rather stupid, insecure but sweet-natured wife and two  brainy kids, and an artist lover named Henrietta Savernake, whose first  love is her sculptures, much to his chagrin. He wants sometimes to break  away from his family and the sick people that he must deal with.<br />When  they go to an old mansion for the weekend, the coolly passionate Henrietta  is not the only lover there--John's old actress girlfriend who wants him as  a boy-toy is present, and she doesn't want to take &quot;no&quot; for an  answer. Then John turns up dead.<br />Hercule Poirot and Henrietta seek to  unravel the mystery of John's death, with totally unexpected results.  What's really special about this mystery is that the emotions of the  characters carry it along, rather than simply following clues and giving  Poirot insights. It's rather unusual for Christie to write a novel/mystery  rather than a straight mystery, but it's not unenjoyable.	2000-09-03

Though Tolkien was not the first fantasy writer, he remains the most beloved and influential, even though \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"The Hobbit\\" are decades old.<br /><br />And with a beloved movie trilogy and a prequel trilogy just concluded last year, countless people have rediscovered Tolkien's brilliant series set in a long-ago, magical world known as Middle-Earth. It's full of elves, dwarves, hobbits, lost kings and wizards, but the spellbindingly complex world and powerful characters are what makes the story brilliant.<br /><br />In \\"The Hobbit,\\" stuffy Bilbo Baggins finds himself dragged out on an adventure with thirteen dwarves and the legendary wizard Gandalf. Their goal: take back the Lonely Mountain from the evil dragon Smaug. But just getting there is half the battle, throwing Bilbo into disasters involving wood-elves, goblins and the bloodthirsty Gollum. But with a golden ring that makes him invisible, Bilbo might be able to take on a dragon -- and a bunch of armies about to go to war.<br /><br />\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" follows up several years after \\"The Hobbit,\\" and switches the focus to Bilbo's cousin/adoptive son Frodo Baggins, who inherits all Bilbo's worldly positions when the older hobbit vanishes. Among them is the golden ring that makes you invisible.<br /><br />Gandalf soon tells Frodo that the ring is really the Ring of Power, a tiny invulnerable token that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. If Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth. This revelation throws Frodo into a long journey to the elven city of Rivendell, with Ringwraiths and the evil wizard Saruman pursuing him every step of the way. And from Rivendell, Frodo is sent with a Fellowship of three other hobbits, two men, an elf, a dwarf, and Gandalf.<br /><br />But death, treachery and orc attacks split up the Fellowship, sending Frodo and his faithful gardener Sam on the path to Mount Doom, while king-in-waiting Aragorn seeks an army large enough to save the country of Gondor. But Gondor -- and the entire world -- are doomed until the Ring is somehow destroyed, and there are far too many people who want to get ahold of it.<br /><br />\\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"The Hobbit\\" are powerful piece of works even in their worst moments. J.R.R. Tolkien drew from legends and myths, ranging from the ancient Norse mythology to more recent legends, mingled with his love of the British country folk and his Roman Catholic beliefs.<br /><br />The two separate stories are rather different, prose-wise. \\"The Hobbit\\" is a more juvenile, whimsical story until the last few chapters, when it becomes much more sober and bloodsoaked. And \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" starts out cozy and pleasant, but slowly evolves into an epic clash between countless peoples, spanning the entirety of Middle Earth. And both stories end bittersweetly, with a price to pay for peace.<br /><br />Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. Bilbo is a relatively \\"ordinary\\" hero by comparison -- he starts out as a stuffy, determinedly boring hobbit, but being exposed to adventure turns him into a far stronger, braver person.<br /><br />The equally vibrant cast also includes Gandalf the crabby grandfatherly wizard, Sam Gamgee the loyal gardener, stubborn Thorin Oakenshield, the stately Elrond, the noble lost king Aragorn, and a variety of kings, elves, dwarves, and more lovable little hobbits.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; Mordor, for example, is best described through the way that Sam and Frodo react to it. The dialogue can range from goofy and hilarious to solemn and archaic, or to some combination of the two. And the pacing is gradual but necessary -- readers with short attention spans won't be able to handle this story. If they can handle sprawling, epic tales, then probably they can.<br /><br />Even after all the years, J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"The Hobbit\\" still rule the fantasy genre and has become an integral part of modern literature. It's an epic for all ages, and few books have even come close to equalling it.y. If they can handle sprawling, epic tales, then probably they can.<br /><br />Even after all the years, J.R.R.

One of the funniest non-Dave Barry humor books ever, this slender book  goes over the various lunatic manifestations of hypochondria, a problem I  have from time to time.

Gene's eventual reply was  that he needed a CAT scan and probably was going to die. This book pretty  much sticks to that vein.<br />The book becomes slightly more serious near the  end, where Gene recounts his diagnosis of Hepatitis C, as well as a visit  to a friend with AIDS. But even these are leavened with humor, such as  Weingarten's mental ramblings when his friend offers him a cookie:  &quot;This dying man is offering me nourishment!

I am a teen, but I hate all of the  literature that features an &quot;ordinary&quot; teen bunch. And yes, the  vampires WERE enough, they didn't need witches in addition to it.<br />And she  seems to be turning back on her own mythology (which is why it's a good  idea to have it at least partially structured BEFORE you write). Her  exploration of Aubrey and turning him into a more caring person kind of  wrecked the one character of hers that I liked.<br />In addition to that, the  plot kind of felt... forced. A gorgeous teen vampire-fiction writer being  stalked by a gorgeous bunch of vampires? Aubrey being mysteriously drawn to  her? It's boring where it's not unoriginal.<br />The entire book seemed  somewhat narcissistic. Not only does the idea of inserting oneself into a  book make me cringe (I only do that when I satirize myself--such as my  funny run) but Atwater-Rhodes even talks about how her alter-ego Jessica  has a body and face &quot;to die for,&quot; about how graceful and brave  and strong and beautiful and attractive she is.<br />And, of course, she is a  misunderstood, cynical outcast--apparently the amazing body and face don't  add anything to her charm at an &quot;ordinary&quot; high school *heavy  sarcasm*. I began hoping that Fala WOULD kill Jessica. The ending and  explanation almost made me laugh, it was so self-indulgent.<br />In addition  to this, I once thought I'd like to meet Miss Atwater-Rhodes. But if she is  like Jessica, no longer. Jessica is obnoxious, selfish, and  self-absorbed--the only person she seems to think about in the book other  than herself is Aubrey, and half the time it's because HE's to die for.<br />And in an effort to make herself sound more &quot;gwown-up,&quot; she  also chose words that were... bad. They didn't fit with the tame  teen-horror flick plotline. (And was the bisexual vampire REALLY necessary?  Felt like &quot;look at me, I'm mature for my age!&quot;)<br />Fala was so  cookie-cutter I cringed, and Caryn... well, I hate to say this, but she was  kinda wimpy. And though I liked the poem, for heaven's sake, it wasn't even  hers!<br />I know many teens who can write much better than this, without  becoming painfully self-indulgent. She simply doesn't have enough talent to  merit the adulation she's getting. She is not an inspiration to me, because  I aspire to publish material that is truly timeless.<br />This book is very  bad. Read something by Vivan Vande Velde, but not this. I hope not to read  anything by this author in future. Good night.r flick plotline. (And was the bisexual vampire REALLY necessary?

I really, really did. I was hyped up and should have liked it, if it had been good. But it's not that good. It's not  that bad, either, but it's nothing to write home about.<br />&quot;Forests of  the Night&quot; is a rather slender novel (my first novel is almost twice  the size) about a vampire (duh duh duh). Tales of how Risika became a  vampire centuries ago is interspersed with modern-day interludes, where she  is hunting the vampire who turned her into one, one bad dude named  Aubrey.<br />My first quibble with this is originality. The writing style may  be good (if a trifle dense for teen-lit) but it can't hide the fact that  Ms. Atwater-Rhodes brings little that is new or interesting to vampire  lore. In fact, she seems to be ripping off already-successful books and  TV-shows, such as &quot;Buffy&quot;, Anne Rice, Christopher Pike, and so  on. Many of the elements are there to be found.<br />In fact, there I am  indebted to Ms. Atwater-Rhodes. Currently writing a vampire short novel  myself, I tried to avoid the cliches and ripoffs that she has here. One  spark of originality has vampires employing humans as messengers, henchmen,  and so on; also, witches who attack vampires.<br />But, also, the plot is  simply too... simple. Past plot: Risika turns into a vampire. Current plot:  Risika attacks Aubrey after killing a few humans. There are twists, but too  few of them. Aubrey was the best part of it--he is a very cool vampire (I'd  love to write a crossover with my own amoral vampire, Saiya).<br />I am also  slightly annoyed that there are more talented teen writers out there who  have a great deal of difficulty being published (and I wish them oodles of  luck!). Ms. Atwater-Rhodes is apparently a media object as the  &quot;14-year-old-author!&quot;, as her book does not stand out as a  classic or a particularly interesting book. She has potential, but there is  little more here.<br />I have not yet read the sequel, &quot;Demon in my  View&quot;, but I have heard less-than-glowing reviews. I will read it,  though, and hope that it is more satisfying than &quot;Forests.&quot;mon in my  View&quot;, but I have heard less-than-glowing reviews. I will read it,  though, and hope that it is more satisfying than &quot;Forests.&quot;	2000-08-22

He devotes a chapter to Hiroshima; also, he covers the ability of the  Japanese to be dignified while being snockered; covers a crime wave and  gangsters; checks out the Japanese foodstuffs; and feels hip for the first  time in years.<br />Barry is his usual irreverent, hilarious self as he covers  the &quot;three hippie tourists&quot; in the conservative world of Japan.

Famed columnist Erma Bombeck teamed up with &quot;Family Circus&quot;'s Bil Keane to create an unusual  and enjoyable book.<br />Both of them write/draw columns/cartoons that talk  about raising teenagers in the 70s (when this was originally published, I  think) Keane's cartoons are not &quot;Family Circus&quot; in later years,  but instead are sometimes-surreal glimpses of seventies parents and kids,  such as the girl who has what appears to be a palm-tree-like growth of hair  on her head, or the boy carrying a restaurant's worth of food to his  room.<br />Ms. Bombeck covers adolescent embarrassment, sex talks with  parents, haircuts of the time, and so on. Her columns are funny, witty, and  most of all, ACCURATE--especially with Keane's cute cartoons. Too bad it's  such a short book--I could read this stuff forever.	2000-08-17

She moves on to their children, their multiple homes,  a saddening chapter about her tragic miscarriage, the chronicles of her  morality arguments with her kids, and finally, her career.<br />She spent  years as a housewife. But Ms. Bombeck's now famous writing started in a  local paper, and she warmly describes how emotionally supportive her  husband was when her columns became well-known. Touring can't have helped  their marriage much, but apparently they both didn't let it hurt it.<br />She  satirizes her own under-par household skills, the weird little quirks that  come in with age, nd the glories of growing old together. She doesn't say  anything about that last one, but it glows throughout the book.<br />Bravo,  Erma.	2000-08-17

Over the course of the  book, she goes to Mass in a church where people go topless (and yes, I mean  the women), goes to Europe with the weirdest bunch of people ever to go on  a tour, tackles the hard rolls from hell, and buys the tiniest mobile home  in history.<br />She dryly comments on every weird detail of travelling  further than five miles, from languages to airplanes to foreign bathrooms  to travel snobs to stuffing yourself with food.

She is pressed by an  apparently lunatic friend to read &quot;The Sub-Total Woman&quot;,  attempting to act sexy and wifely to save her marriage, but only ends up  weirding out her husband and burning up her nightgown.<br />Other chapters  involve Transcendental Meditation, thrift, the guests from hell, astrology  guilt, other people's middle-aged pregnancies, jogging, and the ultimate  frontier: satisfaction.

(A friend of mine claims that either this guy has some Freudian  complex about an attraction to Audrey, or he's trying to place himself in  her aura of classic fame. Either way, creepy and bonkers) I guess Peter  Ustinov's line was correct: &quot;You cannot libel the dead.&quot;<br />This  guy claims that Audrey not only had an illegitimate child, shuttled him off  and basically abandoned him, but tried to control his entire life in a  calculating and creepy way that all witnesses agree was NOT HER WAY. All  accounts point to the fact that Audrey loved children and tried for years  to have one, and was shattered by every miscarriage. She actually died as a  result of a stressful trip to visit impoverished children.<br />But even if  you don't believe that she was a kind person, you can believe that some  Kitty Kellyish person would have dug it up and found PROOF by now. Other  people would have testified something. The account of one person does not a  truth make. It's simply disgusting how this man rants on and on  about  imaginary abuses and manipulations. He needs help, and fast.<br />In addition  to his apparent delusions, the author also has a rotten writing style--he  rambles and goes off the general path. The writing isn't tight or  interesting at all.<br />I advise you to read Audrey : Her Real Story, which I  think is the best ever bio of Audrey Hepburn. If anyone reads this review  and loves Audrey and her memory, I beg you to heed the warnings of most of  the reviewers.	2000-08-16

I was given the &quot;Anne&quot; series as a set, or I would've never read this. After the lackluster, caricature characters of &quot;Ingleside&quot;  and &quot;Rainbow Valley&quot;, I was prepared for another flat goo-trip in  &quot;Rilla of Ingleside.&quot;<br />Instead I found a far more interesting  heroine than Anne ever was--her daughter, Rilla Bertha Blythe. Air-headed,  pretty, and totally unlike the usual LMM heroine, Rilla is locked into the  same kind of secure fairy-world that Anne grew up in, which is shattered  right around the time she turns fifteen. Germany declares war, in what will  rapidly mutate into World War I. Rilla will rapidly be swept into the fray,  forced to face horrific realities before the war is over.<br />Rilla is more  realistic than Anne was, especially in the last few books--I get the  impression that LMM didn't really care anymore for Anne. She starts off as  a rather idiotic young girl who is forced to mature long before her time.  Along the way, she must deal with much-despised babies, snotty older girls,  a certain handsome young man, mismatched shoes, defying the ideas of the  rest of the world, and a series of humiliating events that transform her  from a rather idiotic teen into a strong young woman who's cried her  tears.<br />Only Valancy and maybe Emily have been as spectacular as Rilla.  This book is a must, even if you haven't read the previous ones!	2000-08-13

Barron's  \\"Seven Songs of Merlin.\\" So guess what the antagonist of \\"The Fires of Merlin\\" is!<br /><br />The third volume of this Arthurian fantasy epic introduces some nasty new beasties, magical threats and some explosive dragon action. Barron seems to have overcome his initial roughness, and allows the plot to flow as smoothly as his nature-based writing, as well as the introduction of some interesting new characters.<br /><br />After barely saving his mother's life, Emrys Merlin is relaxing with his family... only to have their peace destroyed when a monstrous magic-sucking monster called a kreelix appears. They were supposedly extinct, but have somehow reappeared -- and to make matters worse, Valdearg (aka \\"Wings of Fire\\") has awakened from his slumber, and is on the warpath for whoever killed his hatchlings.<br /><br />The problem is that there is a prophecy that Wings of Fire's clash with his old enemy (presumed to be a wizard) will result in both of them dying. So Merlin sets out to discover what is happening on \\"Fincayra's darkest day,\\" and finds himself enmeshed with strange sorceresses, a magical conspiracy, a pair of deer-people, and eventually with the ancient dragon himself...<br /><br />\\"The Fires of Merlin\\" sets aside the foresty Celtic symbolism of the previous two books, in favor of fire -- harps burn, lava burns, dragons blast fire, and homicidal anger rages out of control. He also seems to have exhausted his mythological store for the moment, because most of the magical goings-on in this book are pretty original creations.<br /><br />Barron's writing sometimes gets a bit overlush, but it's loaded down with haunting, detailed moments (the deer-people's transformations), eerie threats, and the occasional moment of comic relief (the baby dragon). But the story is overall very grim, particularly since this is the first of Merlin's stories in which his death seems to be assured. Whether or not he will actually die, there's a dark cloud hanging over everything he does.<br /><br />The biggest problem is perhaps the kreelixes -- they're an interesting idea, but they sound more like something out of Star Trek than Arthurian legend. I'm just saying.<br /><br />Merlin is a little older and wiser in this one, and he seems to be feeling the first stirrings of romantic feelings for the bland deer-woman Hallia. And Valdearg is a wonderful antagonist -- he'a an aggressive killer, but he's not evil and at times he even shows signs of dignity and endearing sentiment.<br /><br />\\"The Fires of Merlin\\" temporarily ditches the Celtic myth'n'legend, in favor of dragons and a few new inventions of the author's.

Barron's Lost Years series were kind of light on the Arthurian aspects, but that changes dramatically in \\"The Mirror of Merlin.\\" The story is somewhat less enchanting and swift than the previous Merlin tales (particularly with the ballymag), but it's still an intriguing time-spanning adventure.<br /><br />Hostile marsh ghouls have started rising in the Haunted Marshes of Fincayra, and Merlin and Co. happen to have a mission there (to find Merlin's magical sword). There Merlin encounters a young boy named Ector, who has a mysterious mission of his own there --  as well as the evil witch Nimue, who has used his lost sword as a means to trap him.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Nimue manages to infect Merlin with the bloodnoose, a deadly... thingy that will slice his heart in half. And there is no cure (of course). To be saved, Merlin must seek out Ector's mysterious master -- and discovers a shocking fact about his own destiny, as well as the young boy's.<br /><br />\\"The Mirror of Merlin\\"... is a little less engaging than the previous three books, since the enchanted feeling is more muted and there are fewer fantastical events. But it's still a striking story, particularly since this is where Barron really infuses it with a sense of Arthurian timelessness: the brilliant scene where Merlin speaks to his older self, a T.H. White-styled elder wizard.<br /><br />Barron also does not imbue this meeting with a sense of doom, but rather of destiny, that Merlin will one day be sealed in a cave,' but he will also impact the history of the world and set up the greatest king of mythic lore. And he slips scenes both humorous and horrifying (Nimue summoning the marsh ghouls is particularly chilling) into the plot, making it a much darker story than Barron's previous stories.<br /><br />So unsurprisingly Merlin has a lot to deal with in this story, whether it's the threat to his life or the knowledge of his eventual future. Rhia is painfully absent from this book, and Hallia's bland pleasantness just can't compete with the woodland-girl quirkiness. Additionally, the Ballymag can be a little pain at times and whose speech has all the charm of Jar Jar Binks.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, \\"The Mirror of Merlin\\" is a powerful and rewarding read -- as the ballymag would put it, this book is \\"mooshlovely!\\"ust can't compete with the woodland-girl quirkiness. Additionally, the Ballymag can be a little pain at times and whose speech has all the charm of Jar Jar Binks.

He  sets off for Camelot, determined to follow his dead father's footsteps. But  he soon discovers that knighthood is not all chivalry and flashing armor.  Despite humiliation, dishonor, despair, and a curse, Parzival's innocence  and goodness carry him through to the end.<br />Paterson chose to write this  story in formal prose, but that doesn't keep the hero's appeal from shining  through. Parzival perhaps understands such commands as &quot;Thou Shalt Not  Kill&quot; best--when defeating a foe, he gives them a chance to redeem  themselves, and beats himself up mentally when he does something careless.  Readers ache for him when he is laughed at and then cursed, or refuses to  get rid of the shabby clothes his mother made him. Readers will also cheer  when he makes up for his past, innocent wrongs.<br />In a bookworld that lacks  good, old-fashioned heroes, Parzival is a fearless guy that every boy will  want to be like, and a role model that parents will adore. This legend is  great, and the retelling is even better.	2000-08-12

However, don't compare the two books-they are totally dissimilar and Platform came first. Okay?<br />Nine years ago, the &quot;gump&quot; (sort of a dimensional portal) was open into London from the Island, a magical, beautiful place. Three nurses took the little baby Prince to London-but a desperate rich woman stole him. Nine years have passed. Now, an oddball expedition is setting out to find him composed of a dizzy fey, a fairly pretty hag, a sensitive giant, and a crotchety wizard.<br />Unfortunately, nine years of luxurious living with the Trottles have turned young Raymond into... well, someone not fit to be prince. The oddball four teams up with a compassionate servant boy named Ben to bring Raymond to the gump and return him. Time is running out for them to return, before the gump seals itself for another nine years.<br />And was I the only one getting chills about the lady with the stiletto knitting needles?<br />The main characters are not all there is-there's a hefty addition of many magical creatures living in and around London, including merrows, water nymphs, banshees, mistmakers, ogres, harpies, flower fairies, and so on. Ibbotson has a charming, very English style of writing without being condescending, and this tale has a great deal of magic hovering around it like a mistmaker's mist.

Lyonesse is an air-headed, blonde ditz, while plain Lynet sets off to King  Arthur's court to find a champion-without revealing who she is. She ends up  taking a fancy-talking kitchen boy to do battle with the knight, but  virtually everyone she meets has a strange secret...<br />Lynet is a glorious  heroine, a gal who is unafraid to threaten someone with a spear or venture  to Camelot.

The townspeople range from nice (they like Rizka) to clownish (they don't  like Rizka)<br />Rizka is enjoyable, funny, and brilliant, and she lives the  carefree, stress-free lifestyle that all of us dream of. This carefree  attitude gives her plenty of opportunities to better life in  general.<br />Alexander still hasn't lost his Midas touch-this story could  have been heavy and dull, but it sparkles instead.	2000-08-05

Yolen skimps on few details, and you can tell that her story comes straight from the heart.<br />Hannah, a  modern Jewish girl, is irritated by the Passover Seder and the  &quot;remembering&quot; of the Holocaust, which some of her relatives lived  through. But when she opens the door for Elijah, she is transported through  time and space to a village in Poland.<br />Soon the Nazis arrive, and Hannah  (called &quot;Chaya&quot; by everyone in this new time) must both try to  survive and to keep her friends alive in the deathcamps.<br />I tried very,  very hard to summarize this story, but the spiritual and emotional tones  are simply impossible to talk about. This is an intense book, the  descriptions of it simply can't express the greatness of this plot.<br />A  haunting tale of life, death, memory and sorrow.

Using certain kinds of thyme, they can  transport themselves through thyme... er, time. But, naturally, there are  going to be some peculiar scrapes.<br />The characters are a bit blander than  in Knight's Castle, but they still have their charm. Eliza protesting that  her legs are NOT too long is one wonderful moment; the Natterjack singing  &quot;Rule Britannia&quot; in front of Revolutionary War Americans is  another.<br />Dang, but the Natterjack is fun! An odd, rather self-absorbed  little creature that wields some impressive magic, he makes life strange  for the four adventuring kids. This was the last of the foursome's  adventures, sadly. Only wish that someone could pick up Eager's slack the  way someone did for John Bellairs.	2000-07-30

Her misty, vaguely dreamlike writing can pull a reader into the world of 1900s New Orleans and its society, but her heroine sometimes feels more like a vessel than a fully-realized person.<br /><br />Edna Pontellier is the wife of successful New Orleans businessman L&eacute;once, and mother of two lovely young boys. Yet she is dissatisfied by her life, and feels no connection to the other wives and mothers, who idolize their motherhood and subservience. And when she encounters handsome young Creole Robert Lebrun while on vacation, she begins to \\"awake\\" to the feelings she has left behind during her marriage.<br /><br />Distancing herself from Leonce and her sons, Edna begins exploring art and emotions that have been denied her by the strictures of her society -- as well as an affair with the flirtatious Alc&eacute;e Arobin. She even moves out into a cottage of her own, much to the horror of those who thought they knew her. Her romantic feelings have not moved on from Robert, but his return makes her realize how different she has become...<br /><br />Kate Chopin's most famous work is often cited as a sort of proto-feminist work, with a woman rebelling against the male-dominated role she has been given. The fact that a story about a woman abandoning her husband and kids caused such a scandal only adds to that belief.<br /><br />But that's a rather restricted label to give such a versatile author, and \\"Awakening\\" is a book with too many facets to be so restrained. In many ways Chopin resembles a Southern version of Edith Wharton, exploring the stultifying society that she once dwelled in, and the often-tragic consequences of people -- particularly women -- who dared to step outside those unforgiving boundaries.<br /><br />Chopin's lush writing elevates this story even further, weaving an atmospheric, vaguely dreamlike web around everyday New Orleans. She makes readers feel the heat of a summer's day, the remote beauty of a party, the eerie majesty of an empty sea. And though \\"The Awakening\\" is infused by a feeling of languid dreaminess, Chopin creates a feeling of tension and inevitability that grows as the book goes on. It's almost a shock at the book's finale, when that tension releases in a quiet burst of poetic language.<br /><br />And to her credit, Chopin is able to make her points about women and society without setting up straw-men. Such characters as \\"angel of the house\\" Ad&egrave;le Ratignolle and the stuffy Leonce (who sees Edna as his personal property and expects her to obey) are examples of the usual society of the time, yet Leonce is a fully realized character who loves -- but can never understand -- his wife.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest problem is that Edna herself is at times rather thin as a character. While she has many conflicting desires, she sometimes seems like a mere vessel for all those desires to be displayed over time. But there are some scenes where she does seem like a fully realized person, such as when she meditates on her lack of housewifely virtues, is struck by wild mood swings around her sons, and befriends Mademoiselle Reisz.<br /><br />\\"The Awakening\\" is more than just an early feminist novel -- it's an exquisitely written story about the roads that our own desires can take us down, and the tragedies that can come from it.

All the same, it's so beautiful that sometimes I have difficulty reading it.<br />A man has crashed in the desert, and out of nowhere a little Prince appears. The Prince talks to him and  keeps him company, while also telling him of his travels. The Prince is  truly charming, a wise little boy who captures the heart immediately, and  his stories and observations have the otherworldly quality of a dream.<br />At  the same time, there is a sadness that permeates the book-somehow I felt  that it could not end happily, and that made this story all the more  precious.<br />This is a book that is shoved with the children's literature,  and I believe that it is often overlooked by adults who would benefit from  the simplicity of the Little Prince.	2000-07-30

It's a part of Eager's ongoing, sometimes intertwined fantasy serieses starring flawed yet admirable characters. Note: There's a bit of an in-joke in one bit of  dialogue, concerning the kids' mothers from a previous book of Eager's, but  it won't confuse you if you've so much as read the back of the other  books.<br />Roger and his sister's father needs surgery, and his frightened  kids are taken along to stay with their cousins, bossy Eliza and  camera-obsessed Jack. The thing that cheers frightened Roger up is a toy  castle his aunt gives him, and his vast army of toy soldiers. But the  oldest of them all tells Roger that he must EARN his wishes...<br />Soon Roger  and his relatives (parents excluded) are tossed into the medieval world of  Robin Hood and Ivanhoe, a world that can be altered by what is set around  the toys, such as wastepaper baskets and dollhouses.<br />The ending is still  a bit confusing (I'm not entirely certain what's going on) but the book  overall has far more intricacy and imagination than Harry Potter or Which  Witch or anything like that. Especially since Eager wrote this decades ago,  when children's fantasy was much more scarce. The kids are all totally  believable and enjoyable, and the various knights and ladies either make  you cheer or boo, depending on whether they're despicable or not..<br />Utter  not the words of power: &quot;Lead soldiers!&quot;	2000-07-30

I never really got much of a look into Boone's mind during the  first season of EFC, so being able to see these events through his eyes was  very, very pleasing for me. I think I like him better now, that I've seen  someone's fairly accurate portrayal of him.<br />This book is shorter and less  lyrical than &quot;Protector&quot; and less eerily dreamlike than  &quot;Arrival,&quot; but it's about a cop-the writing is in sync with that.  Slightly confusing and a bit choppy were the letters from Boone's wife  Kate, sprinkled throughout the text, but this did not detract much from my  overall enjoyment.<br />A minor note: The cover is slightly inaccurate, as it  identifies Boone as &quot;Da'an's first protector&quot;. In fact, Da'an's  first protector was Ronald Sandoval. Boone was the second.	2000-07-29

Okay, I thought that a book about bad things that happen to a few young children couldn't possibly be good. It couldn't possibly be interesting. And it DEFINITELY wouldn't be enjoyable.<br />Boy am I an idiot.<br />The  Baudelaire children are a trio of orphans who lose their parents early in  the book, and end up being shifted to the miserly accomodations of their  Uncle Olaf, a thoroughly despicable character who comes after Saruman and  the White Witch for hateability. He wants their money, which they are not  allowed to have yet, and treats them horribly.<br />The characters, except the  Baudelaire children, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny, have very little character  development but somehow end up being fully believable and playing on your  emotions precisely how the writer intended. The writing style is nothing to  write home about, yet manages to be witty and descriptive--I could  practically see the events being talked about, and the characters as  well.<br />In a word, this book has the quality of being a wondrous story  without overdoing the detail and things like that.<br />Does it have a happy  ending? You can find the answer at the very first page. This is a dark  story, dark but excellent. If your children want a happily-ever-after  story, I would advise not having them read this--it will only depress them.

It's structured a bit like a novel, rather than a slice of a real life, but the great writing style and unembellished characters make it all the better.

Renamed &quot;Thornmallow&quot; (prickly on the  outside, squishy inside), he soon makes a name for himself--he swamps a  classroom in snow, inadvertantly yells during an orientation speech, and so  on. But he soon discovers that he is one of 113 students, who are there to  defeat the evil wizard Nettle and his enormous Beast.  But Thornmallow  doesn't think he can do it.<br />This is a shorter but much more INTENSE book  than most wizardly tales. Its shortness is made up for by the sheer magic  of Wizard's Hall--moving pictures, lizards swimming in the soup (which can  be changed by older students), and the constellation ceiling that  talks!<br />I love Thornmallow, he's so HUMAN. Who among us hasn't completely  embarrassed themselves in front of a room of people? Or botched up  something over and over?

A princess doesn't like her life of privilege and wealth, so she either hangs around her home being rebellious, or she runs away.<br /><br />But what if a princess ran away from home... to be housekeeper to a dragon?<br /><br />That's the concept of \\"Dealing With Dragons,\\" a clever little fantasy that tells its own quirky story while cleverly lampooning the tropes of high fantasy and fairy tales. A lot of the charm comes from Patricia Wrede's humorous dialogue (\\"Oh bother!\\") and the cliche-busting character of Cimorene, who just wants to be free to pursue her love of unprincessy things like cooking and magic.<br /><br />Princess Cimorene is rather put out when she's told that she cannot use swords, Latin conjugation, spoons or magic... because she's a princess. When her parents decide they're going to marry her off to the son of Sathem-by-the-Mountains, she takes the advice of a magic frog and runs away... to become the housekeeper and personal princess of a dragon, Kazul.<br /><br />This lifestyle suits Cimorene much better than her \\"proper\\" princess life, despite the princes and knights who keep trying to rescue her. But she soon discovers that the dragons are in danger from the wizards -- and before long, they have poisoned the King of the Dragons. And if Cimorene doesn't thwart the wizards' plot, dragon society might be turned upside down.<br /><br />One of the best things about \\"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles\\" is that it is a pretty decent high fantasy story. In addition to the whole fun story about a princess trying to escape her stuffy princessy life, there's some entertaining dragon politics, magical strife, and melting wizards. None of it takes itself too seriously, but there is an actual plot here to be appreciated on its own.<br /><br />But while telling its own story, it's gently poking fun at the sort of things you find in these sorts of stories and how they're typically used (Cimorene tries to avoid a marriage by declaring \\"he hasn't rescued me from a giant or an ogre or freed me from a magic spell\\"). And Wrede's writing matches this plot nicely -- quirky and clever, with a slightly British flavour, and plenty of humorous dialogue (\\"If they'd simply done what they were told, they wouldn't be here.\\" \\"Still, turning them into slabs of stone forever seems a little extreme\\").<br /><br />Since the Rebellious Princess is pretty standard now, it's fun to see one that doesn't whine much, even if she likes all sorts of things that aren't princessy (magic, fencing, cooking cherries jubilee). So her sensible approach to getting her own freedom is quite delightful, especially since it shows that she doesn't need a man. Which, of course, doesn't stop various men -- including her unwanted suitor Therandil -- from coming to rescue her against her will.<br /><br />And her sensible, no-nonsense approach to everything is really quite charming, whether she's trying to reason with a homicidal jinn or doing Kazul's dishes. Kazul herself is a fun dragon character, being very reasonable and sensible in her own right, and Wrede presents a number of charming characters like Morwen, a witch with cats and a sign that says \\"NONE OF THIS NONSENSE, PLEASE.\\"<br /><br />Patricia C.

MaryAnne befriends the hero's young  daughter and his wife, as he begins dreaming of angels. It's not entirely  clear when this takes place, but I believe it was either the 1940s or  1950s.<br />&quot;Timepiece&quot; is the story of how MaryAnne and David  Parkin met. We are also introduced to the excellent characters of Victoria,  a creepy socialite; Lawrence, an elderly black friend of David's; and his  business partner. We follow them through about five years, from when a new  secretary comes to work for David, later marries him, and their child,  Andrea is born. But a horrible tragedy due to racism causes an attack on  Lawrence and a terrible fate for Andrea.<br />&quot;The Letter&quot; is the  final part of the trilogy, taking place about twenty years after  &quot;Timepiece.&quot; MaryAnne has grown miserable after Andrea's death,  because David has completely shut himself off. When she vanishes, David  sets off on an obsessive quest to find his long-long mother, accompanied by  a bright young woman who has definite designs on him.<br />Some may find the  overall story too cloying, but it has a refreshing innocence, that after  hundreds of icky books I find very relaxing. David is one of my favorite  literature characters-he is human and flawed, and his flaws make him all  the more vulnerable and lovable. A story for your whole family to read.	2000-07-08

But when he goes  to a party, he meets a young socialite named Dierdre, who is attracted to  him and plans to do something about it.<br />Soon, David leaves to find out  where his mother is, with Dierdre accompanying him. He discovers things  about himself, his life, and his marriage, but it takes a tragedy to bring  everyone together for the tearjerking finale.<br />This has more mature themes  than before, with mentions of illegitimate children, alcoholism, suicide  and Dierdre's pursuit of a married man. All are tasteful and relatively  pure, though.<br />Characterizations are at their best here-David grows and  blossoms painfully as he realizes how he has shut everyone out. The reader  can feel Lawrence's despair at his blindness and mortality. Dierdre is,  fortunately, not portrayed as an amoral homewrecker, but rather as a rather  spoiled but kind young woman whose attraction to David grows into real  love. MaryAnne is seen less than in the previous books, but we see  stirrings of the sad, but beautiful and faithful woman in &quot;Christmas  Box.&quot;<br />An underappreciated classic, I'd love to see this made into a  movie.	2000-07-08

The writing style is quite pleasant! So why only two stars? Simple! Not my constant exclaimation points! It's because of the author's  attitude!<br />The plot is probably well-known to anyone who would actually be  checking these reviews-Brendan the Navigator, a man from ancient Ireland,  clashes with Padraig (read: St. Patrick, St. Paddy, et cetera) when the  Christian brings the new religion there. Brendan apparently feels that the  time to go has come, and he and his fellow Celts (soon to be Kelts) leave  the world. Literally.<br />I know pagans who were very respectful of my  Christian beliefs and I of theirs. Ms. Keneally paints virtually all  Christians in this as hypocrites, shriekers, shallow-minded types.  Christianity itself has not been to blame for things like the  Inquisition-atrocities done in the name of the religion by kings and lords  are not CONDONED by the religion.<br />I am wondering why Ms. Keneally did  this-I agree with the reader from Columbia, she sounds very  intolerant.<br />That said and done, I liked the background for it-woowee! The  idea of Celts attempting to preserve their culture by LEAVING EARTH is  certainly one that I'd never have dreamed up. I liked the background on the  Daanans, which was equally unique. I would have liked it if more time had  been spent on the colonization, the feelings of the people there, their  reactions to the changes, and so on.<br />With some changes, this fair book  could be a GREAT book.	2000-07-05

Young Obi-Wan is frustrated with the stagnant job to which he has been assigned, and begins digging through records to discover the person who blew up a  mine.<br />Meanwhile, Qui-Gon's concentration on his mission is sent spinning  with a new arrival: his ex-apprentice Xanatos. The story of Xanatos's exit  from the Order is deep and disturbing, and the lightsaber battles are  impressively written.<br />A familiar face is young Si Treemba, the Arconan  who Obi-Wan befriended previously. The newer characters are somewhat less  vibrant than Wolverton's, but still memorable.<br />The main flaws appear to  be: the cover art of Qui-Gon is clearly lifted from TPM, Clat'Ha is a  nebulous presence, Obi-Wan seems to shift backward (not impossible, but  odd), and the planet that Qui-Gon considered dangerous in the previous book  seems quite tame.<br />I enjoyed this book a great deal!	2000-06-24

Wolverton has a wonderful grasp of Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon's personalities.<br />Twelve-year-old Obi-Wan Kenobi has only a few weeks to be made a padawan apprentice, but after a fight he is assigned to the Agri-Corps, a farming brigade. He hoped to become the apprentice of Qui-Gon Jinn, but Qui-Gon's tortured past and memories intrude on his chances. Qui-Gon lost his second apprentice to the Dark Side (see book two) and is unwilling to take the risk of another.<br />Obi-Wan is devastated that he will not become a Jedi, but like a Jedi he sets off to the agricultural planet of Bandomeer. Soon he discovers that things are going rottenly -- he is beaten by a Hutt, and is told by a mining leader Clat'Ha that the Hutts and the timid Arconan miners are at odd with one another. Obi-Wan naively believes that he can deal with the situation -- but things only get worse when he tries. Even worse, Qui-Gon is traveling on the same transport.<br />When pirates attack the ship, Qui-Gon is seriously injured and the ship is crippled. Obi-Wan manages to land it on a planet - where there is little food, water and shelter, but huge numbers of reptilian draigons. When the Hutts take control of a vital resource for the Arconan and try to blackmail them into servitude, Obi-Wan must learn a vital lesson about being a true Jedi and about the Force...<br />I didn't particularly like Wolverton's &quot;Courtship of Princess Leia,&quot; but he does an excellent job with Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, Yoda and the background of it all. His strong point (more so than successor Jude Watson) is action scenes, which are tight and evocative; the scene with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan fighting draigons is especially entrancing.<br />Though I find some of the Hutts' actions a bit odd (Crawling between rocks? Those hulks?) the book is very close to perfect. The two Jedi are shored up by an excellent supporting cast, including Clat'Ha, the tough but not nasty mining director; Si Treemba the young Arconan miner who befriends Obi-Wan; and the villainous Jemba.<br />WARNING: This book may cause instant addiction, causing you to sprint for the second book.

Though published by the same people as the &quot;Jedi Apprentice&quot; books, this one is both more complex and considerably darker.<br />The young hero, Tal, is searching for a sunstone so that he can undertake a ritual quest, and solidify his  family's position in the favored classes of his darkened world. If he  fails, he and his younger siblings and his ill mother will be relegated to  servants for the rest of their lives. But an enemy is trying to thwart  Tal's attempts, and he must try to get a sunstone on his own-with  disturbing results.<br />The levels of differentness in this book are  spectacular, though not as much so as Sabriel-one can hardly expect  something so advanced for readers of Jedi Apprentice! Tal is a thoroughly  human and sympathetic character, and as he grows more desperate the reader  wants him to succeed more.<br />Compared to the kids' fantasy usually  published now, this is a gem. I wish I could give it 6 stars!	2000-06-14

It also has an unusual hero andheroine, and none of the slightly condescending attitude in the &quot;Anne&quot; series and &quot;Story Girl.&quot;<br />Valancy, having reached the decrepit age of 29 without even having had a boyfriend, is under the tyrannical thumbs of her despicable extended family. They're not cruel or unusually mean, but they have annoying emotional traditions that are slowly driving Valancy into deep depression.<br />Suddenly she receives the news that she is fatally ill, and throws out all restraint. She chooses to nurse a dishonored invalid friend of hers, living and cooking for the girl's alcoholic father (one of the best characters in the book-the man is a riot) Soon afterwards she marries one of the most disreputable men around because she likes him-to the great dismay of her family, because she's going to die anyhow. But soon she discovers that her new life is not as simple as it seems....<br />I want to marry a man like Barney. He is completely believable, the most casual man in current fiction. He and Valancy compliment each other perfectly, and though some things about his past can be guessed halfway through the book, others will shock you.<br />This is a story about a woman of the early 1900s being true to herself, &quot;The Awakening&quot; without the adultery and suicide. The reader rejoices when Valancy rejects the gangrenous traditions of her family and lives her own life, as she sees fit; it's enjoyable to see every new step she takes toward total freedom, such as buying a revealing dress, and cutting her hair.<br />Every girl and woman should read &quot;The Blue Castle&quot;-being free and true to yourself has never been so well-represented.	2000-06-12

He soon discovers that Jonathan is a wizard--so is the  crotchety next-door-neighbor, Mrs.  Zimmerman. And by attempting to impress  his friend, Lewis has unleashed a long-dead evil force that is trying to  bring about the end of the world...<br />Aside from the ghost story, there is  also an underlying theme concerning Lewis's friend, who taunts him into  doing things he knows isn't right. Hopefully, this would affect readers  into thinking over what a true friend, like Mrs. Zimmerman, is in  comparison to the kids at school.<br />Lewis is likable because of his  truthful portrayal, an ugly duckling with a heart of gold. His uncle  Jonathan is a rough diamond with a strange sense of humor, who will win  over the readers immediately.<br />Some readers might be offended by the usage  of &quot;white magic&quot; and accidental &quot;black magic,&quot; by the  heroes of this book, but do keep in mind that the &quot;white magic&quot;  is mostly illusions, like a holodeck, and Lewis almost dooms the world  because of his dabblings in the &quot;dark side,&quot; of which he quickly  repents. The magic is of the type in many fantasy novels, unrealistic and  dreamlike.<br />This book is an excellent read!	2000-05-30

After a warrior of the witch Civet attacks Thorn, Shimmer saves him and takes him away from his abusive master.<br /><br />Civet once stole the sea belonging to the race of dragons and confined it in a pebble, leaving it a salt-covered wasteland. Shimmer, who has a terrible secret of her own, has decided to find her and reclaim the waters of her home. They set out across the sea and meet the mischievous and irritating Monkey, then find Civet after she floods a village.<br /><br />The dialogue is snappy and amusing, and the descriptions are well-done, especially the beautiful visions of the dragons' seas, prior to their draining by Civet. Yep strikes an excellent balance between spare prose and descriptive prose, placing each where it belongs.<br />&lt;b!r>Shimmer's tough shell (she has both a literal and figurative one) is an effective shield against the kind<br />of hurt that she has suffered in the past, given her rejection prior to this book. Her attempts to rebuff Thorn, or to convince him that she doesn't need his help and can do things perfectly well on her own, are as unconvincing to the readers as they are to Thorn. She needs a friend, though she does not wish to admit it.<br /><br />An effective counterbalance to her cynicism and I-don't-need-anybody attitude is Thorn, an intelligent and optimistic young boy, who was basically enslaved at an inn with an abusive master. He becomes Shimmer's friend after his rescue, wanting to help her out of sheer kindness. The situations in which he jolts her out of her huffs are entertaining and snappily written.<br /><br />An excellent, classic fantasy, well worth the while of the reader.	2000-04-04

But then a strange  little boy named Mackie appears, and reveals that the inhabitants of the  house are very much alive. A band of vicious, cutthroat robbers lives in  the house, with a troop of orphaned servant boys. When the boys come of  age, they are initiated into the band. A sinister addition is that the  robbers have magic cloaks that enable them to become invisible.<br />Despite  the fluffy-sounding plot, this is not a fluffy book. It includes small  dollops of physical abuse, injury, and overall unhappiness, as well as a  plot that shifts from action to suspense. But good wins out over evil in  this gritty, pulse-pounding book. Kudos!	2000-04-04

I picked this up on my second pass through the library, because Arthurian legend is not really my niche. And boy am I glad I did!<br />Shortly after the arrival of pretty-boy womanizer Lancelot, who immediately begins an affair  with Queen Guinevere, an otherworldly knight called simply the &quot;Green  Knight&quot; arrives to challenge one of Arthur's knights. Terence's master  Gawain volunteers, and in a year must sacrifice his own life.<br />Along the  way to pay Gawain's debt, he and Terence meet up with a bizarre bunch of  people, both of this world and the Otherworld. They also pick up a young  woman named Eileen, independent and sharp-tonged, before arriving at the  Green Knight's abode to be taught a lesson.<br />Terence and Gawain are  excellent characters, ironic and fresh and completely loyal to their king  and country. King Arthur himself sheds the stuffiness of legend and  resembles &quot;Star Trek&quot;'s Captain Kirk. Guinevere and Lancelot make  you want to slap them, exactly as they're meant to. Eileen reminded me a  great deal of Lloyd Alexander's Eilonwy, with her quick wit and mild  disdain for any bumbling.<br />Some references are made to the previous book,  which makes it slightly more confusing (first time around I wondered,  &quot;Who is Robin?&quot;) but not too much. With its mingled drama and  comedy, this book is a treasure.	2000-04-04

And T.A. Barron's lushly flowering prose and mythological insertions make this a delight.<br /><br />Merlin is given the Flowering Harp to repair the land from the blight's damage. But since his ego is getting out of control, he decides to bring his mother Elen to Fincayra instead, even though he knows that this may attract Rhita Gawr's attention. Well, you can guess what happens -- Rhita Gawr sends a \\"death shadow\\" after Merlin, which attacks Elen. She can only be cured by the Dagda's intervention.<br /><br />The spirit of Merlin's grandfather Tuatha tells him that he must master the Seven Songs of wizardry before he can meet Dagda, and he only has a month before Elen will die. Desperate to save her, Merlin sets off to accomplish his mission -- along with Rhia and the depressing jester Bumblewy -- but he may lost just as much as he stands to gain...<br /><br />Most fantasy heroes pretty much take the \\"saving the world\\" thing in stride, so it's a nice touch that this heroic quest is triggered by the hero's ego blowing out of control, meaning he has to fix what he's broken. And like any magical quest, it's crammed with bizarre creatures, magic and a new brewing threat to Fincayra.<br /><br />Barron's prose is still richly-descriptive, soaked with forests, leaves and fields, as well as a burned wasteland that is almost painful to read about. He balances out a feeling of urgency, woven with humor (Bumblewy's eventual success in making someone laugh), strange magical items, and a journey that reminds me of Greek heroes' journeys into the underworld.<br /><br />Merlin is the same flawed hero as before, and he finds out the hard way that with great power comes great responsibility, yada yada Spiderman stuff. It's a wrenching, powerful chunk of character development, particularly since EVERY problem in this book is his fault. Rhia is the same irrepressable forest sprite, ready to pierce Merlin's ego when it needs a pinprick, and we learn something genuinely surprising about her in this story.<br /><br />If \\"The Lost Years of Merlin\\" was an exploration of the hero's mysterious roots, then \\"Seven Songs\\" is all about him exploring his even more mysterious magical powers.ly since EVERY problem in this book is his fault.

A ghost  is haunting the young Princess Teresina, who is to be wed to villainous  Count Scarazoni in a few days time.

Avi's characters are intriguing and real, especially weary  Mangus, independent Fabrizo, and mischievous Teresina. Some of the  characters are a bit flat, including the queen and Scarazoni, but it does  not detract much from the story; Lorenzo's whereabouts are somewhat obvious  after a while. However, Avi's imagery and dialogue are wonderful, and the  magic woven into the words makes this an interesting and enjoyable read.	2000-04-02

He creeps  into the heads of the characters and helps bring them to life further in  the way only an author can. Qui-Gon Jinn is especially vibrant.<br />There are  some inconsistancies. The end battles and swordfighting in the book is  somewhat different, I think, from the movie's version; it includes many  lines of dialogue cut from the movie (not that I'm complaining); Jar Jar  seems more competent; and Brooks seems to be very vague on Queen Amidala's  clothing.

I wonder if Leni Parker's Da'an inspired White (sadly deceased)  for Ma'el.<br />Declan is a great deal like Boone, my second favorite  character in the book. Sinead seemed slightly less sympathetic to my eyes,  but I thought that her glimpses of the future were intriguing, especially  her last one.

Gene Stratton Porter was at the peak of her skills when she wrote \\"A Girl of the Limberlost,\\" which starts off as a young girl's struggle against her mother's virulent hatred -- and soon evolves into an enchanting little romance.<br /><br />Elnora Comstock has barely signed up for college when she discovers that she can't afford it -- tuition and textbooks cost too much, and her shabby clothes are mocked by her classmates. Even worse, her half-crazy, malicious mother refuses to cough up any money.<br /><br />But she soon finds that she can pay another way -- a strange lady called the Bird Woman is willing to pay money for moths, butterflies, caterpillars and chrysalids, which Elnora can easily find in a vast dangerous swamp called the Limberlost. And her friends Margaret and Wesley are happy to help her in any way they can -- clothes, a violin -- until the day when Mrs. Comstock comes to a shocking realization about her daughter.<br /><br />Then Elnora encounters a wealthy young man named Philip Ammon, who has the same love of nature that she has -- as well as a wealthy socialite fiancee named Edith. But when a party in honor of Edith and Philip's engagement is wrecked by a butterfly and a fit of jealousy, he begins to realize what his true feelings for Elnora are...<br /><br />\\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" can be divided into two sections -- the first is a Cinderellaesque story about a strong, intelligent young girl who is pursing her music and education, despite her nasty old mother's loathing of her. But once that storyline is wrapped up, the second half of the book becomes a haunting, passionate love story.<br /><br />Stratton-Porter was at her peak when she wrote this -- her prose is overflowing with natural beauty (\\"the whole earth was purple with a thick blanket of violets\\") and some very tough personal situations, such as when Margaret and Wesley take in a badly-abused young boy. And both halves of \\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" reach a emotionally harrowing climax as two of the characters are forced to see the raw ugliness of their actions.<br /><br />But the romance is also really adorable, especially since it's based on friendship and both parties only realize it belatedly. And Stratton-Porter adds in a touch of romance for other characters, including old married couples and snotty socialites.<br /><br />Elnora is a likable, realistic girl that you'd like as a friend -- kind, charitable and hardworking, but has flashes of temper. And Philip Ammon is a rather sweet if clueless guy. Mrs. Comstock starts out as a crazy old lady who wallows in her grief and obsession with her dead husband, but Stratton-Porter rebuilds her into a character you can like and respect; Edith also starts off as a nasty snotty rich girl who cares more about social status than love, but the author puts her through the grinder and makes her more likable.<br /><br />\\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" is both a brilliant coming-of-age tale and a lush little romance, set against an epic backdrop of natural beauty. Definitely a must-read.f the Limberlost\\" reach a emotionally harrowing climax as two of the characters are forced to see the raw ugliness of their actions.

And Stratton-Porter adds in a touch of romance for other characters, including old married couples and snotty socialites.    Elnora is a likable, realistic girl that you'd like as a friend -- kind, charitable and hardworking, but has flashes of temper. And Philip Ammon is a rather sweet if clueless guy. Mrs. Comstock starts out as a crazy old lady who wallows in her grief and obsession with her dead husband, but Stratton-Porter rebuilds her into a character you can like and respect; Edith also starts off as a nasty snotty rich girl who cares more about social status than love, but the author puts her through the grinder and makes her more likable.    \\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\" is both a brilliant coming-of-age tale and a lush little romance, set against an epic backdrop of natural beauty. Definitely a must-read.	2000-02-18

Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.<br /><br />And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic. And with the first \\"Hobbit\\" movie coming out in a few months, it deserves revisiting.<br /><br />Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.<br /><br />But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.<br /><br />So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?<br /><br />Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.<br /><br />Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.<br /><br />Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.<br /><br />This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.<br /><br />The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.<br /><br />\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was.

Sachar is an excellent writer with an excellent style.<br />Stanley Yelnats, the overweight underdog of his school, is accused unjustly of stealing a pair of very famous sneakers, and sent to  Camp Green Lake, a repulsive hard-knocks camp, overseen by a conscienceless  Warden, and arrayed with a huge number of scorpions, rattlesnakes, and  poisonous lizards. He secretly thinks that it is the curse of his  great-great-great-grandfather, who broke a promise to an old lady, that has  doomed every succeeding Yelnats to failure.<br />Together, he and his friend  Hector &quot;Zero&quot; Zeroni set out to find the treasure of Kissin'  Kate, a legendary outlaw. And the twist at the end is a true treasure to  behold.<br />The story of Stanley is well-paced, interspersed with stories  from hundreds of years ago, about his ancestor and Kissin' Kate.<br />The  characters, especially Zero and Stanley, are excellently-constructed. All  the boys at Green Lake are well fleshed-out, keeping themselves isolated  and toughened up while subconsciously banding together. With the exception  of the creepy Mr. Sir, the villains are never shown as the ordinary  kid-hating children's book villain, seeming to be sadistic in  general.<br />This book deserved the Newbery Award. Bravo, Mr. Sachar.	2000-02-04

Yet the magic is less about the middle-ages universe that the characters are in as much as their personalities.<br />A peasant boy, Brill, is plucked from his home to be the personal companion to the irritating, obnoxious Prince Grossder. During  his time in the sumptuous but dangerous palace, he meets strong-willed  Segra and the reptilian dragator (aquatic dragon) Peachy. They both join a  rebellion against the evil king...<br />It is a shame that this series is  mostly out of print. It beats most of the pop fiction of the same reading  level.	2000-01-30

Most second books are weak; this one, if anything, is far more multilayered and mature in its content. There is character death, and there is more political conflict.<br />Princes and war leaders show up at Caer Dallben with a mission: find the Cauldron that supplies the dark lord Arawn with his deathless, lifeless soldiers. Taran, the Assistant Pig-Keeper, is elated that he will be able to participate in his first real adventure (since the last one was because of a series of accidents) with a sword and the respect of his peers. This becomes something of a problem with the arrival of Ellidyr, Son of Pen-Llarcau - an obnoxious and arrogant prince who looks down on Taran, Eilonwy, and Gurgi.<br />Taran, Ellidyr, Prince Gwydion, the dwarf Doli, the kindly warrior Adaon, bard-king Fflewddur Fflam and others ride off to infiltrate Annuvin, Arawn's lands. (They inadvertantly have to bring Eilonwy and Gurgi) But they soon find that the situation has become much more complex, as there are forces other than Arawn and Gwydion who want the Cauldron...<br />The story becomes more Tolkienesque in this volume. The language becomes a little more formal, especially for Taran. And Alexander doesn't shrink away from battle and character death - none of it is graphic, but it is deeply saddening. His writing reflects this, as it is far stronger and more beautiful than in \\"Book of Three.\\"<br />The tempering of Taran, which comes to full in the last two books of the series, really begins here. At the beginning, Taran is an eager boy who wants to go out, fight, be a hero. Though he is called on to act heroically, he is a wiser and sadder young man; he's seen battle and death, and they aren't the glorious foe-slaying parade that he imagined. Gurgi's growing loyalty to Taran is demonstrated, as is Eilonwy and Gwydion's growing respect for him. Eilonwy, Gurgi and Fflewddur are all their irrepressible selves, no matter what.<br />The supporting characters are also strong: we have the goodhearted bearlike king Smoit; the sinister Morgant; the arrogant, obnoxious Ellidyr who seems to secretly envy Taran; Gwystyl, the most depressed of the Hidden Folk; and, of course, the three weird witches living in the Marshes of Morva.<br />Ignore the hideous animated movie, and read this delightful book.
