The book was this one which not only entertained but also informed (and infuriated by the reaction of the faithful to what most would call overwhelming evidence). Both media draw the same conclusion: Not a shred of evidence exists for the history described in the BOM.  Whether the criterion for measurement is human DNA, linguistics, architecture or anthropology, there is no similarity to ancient Hebrews.  Native Americans are related to Asians (DNA, dental structure, language, architecture, myths) who crossed circa 30,000 years ago when the continents were joined. The similarity of the two groups is obvious at even a casual glance. Scientists have found campfires 750,000 years old yet not one object or bone from the enormous civilization described in the BOM  despite decades of extensive searching.    Accepting the BOM means accepting the story of its origins:  God, Jesus and angels visit Smith (he gives conflicting stories) and lead him to buried gold tablets.  he looks into a hat and translates &#34;neo-Egyptian&#34; into King James English (though the king lived 1,000 years after the tablets were written).  LOL The original BOM is grammatically a circus:  &#34;I was afeared of him&#34;.  &#34;Adieu&#34; (lol)    Smith also wrote the infamous Book of Abraham from &#34;real&#34; papyri that, when tested, was the wrong date and had nothing to do with Abraham. The LDS is appropriately silent on this episode.   But none of this nonsense changes anything.  It is difficult to leave an organization that one is taught is the arbiter of truth, whether it is Marxism, Catholicism or Mormonism, the one &#34;true&#34; church. The LDS is a profoundly American invention, constantly adjusting to changing social situations with convenient &#34;revelations&#34; from God that contradict previous revelations.  Slowly, they are replacing Smith with a new movement of happy campers dedicated to the church and its growth .	2005-10-10

First is the plot:  Sun sends forth big flare, Earthlings somehow have prior warning, prepare for worst. Secondly, the size of the novel:  Thin with LARGE font.  Third, the first chapter is only a little over a page long. <br /> <br />There is almost nothing to recommend this book. Characters are emminently bland and forgettable, dialogue is the stuff only spoken in novels, 2037 seems like a thousand - not 32 - years away.  The politics is so amateurish...\\"The Eurasion bloc\\" which oddly does not include any Asians except Russia (the authors get mixed up and say \\"European\\" bloc at times), American and China who is \\"sending up spacecraft to unknown places\\". Lots of stupid babbling about \\"Muslim, Christian & Jewish\\" literalists uniting against everyone those who want world peace.  Right, Shia works closely with Southern Baptist and Orthodox Jew. Yeah, right. <br /> <br />Then there's the premise:  Aliens want to snuff out intelligent life so instead of coming here and blasting the planet apart they embark on a 2,000 year long project to sling a large planet from one star into our sun so that they can fly to Jupiter and watch the show. In the process they create Christmas - absurdly hokey tale about a \\"bright star\\", magi, and a \\"child laying in the hay in Bethlehem. <br /> <br />Earth wins (of course) with the help of our nice computer pals Athena and Aristotle (I kid you not).  And all those Chinese spaceships boil down to one (1) vessel found on Mars with young dead colonists.  Earth is almost destroyed but no one seems the least bit upset...\\"Are cell phones working?\\" seems a primary concern.  It's like the authors had too many one night at the bar and kept thinking up the most hackneyed plots possible.  Actually, it is worst than all this because the rest of it was so boring it would almost be a crime to rehash it.  Avoid like the plague.	2005-09-19

It's a classic space opera with a galaxy for a stage. I'm a sucker for tales about \\"lost aliens who may have left clues\\" particularly those stories in which the characters are as well-developed as these.  Dan (and dad) are nearly perfect as flesh and blood guys of the 26th century.  The love affair between Dan and his wife was gentle, touching, real. The story, which develops into a convoluted though thoroughly-explainable plot, keeps one's attention. <br /> <br />There is one major plotline and several sub-plots: The aliens and their message drives the story forward. The relationship between Dan and Cal is like all father-son relationships - complex, moody, territorial. Then there is the band of Russians who've almost evolved via machinery past humanity. Finally, merging the past and future is the assassing Khouri with all her secrets.  In the end it is human beings that matter the most - over the most far-reachingn science fiction. Perhaps there were too many  characters, a common problem with many authors, but the novel's length enabled the author to \\"flesh out\\" everyone.  <br /> <br />What blows the mind are the descriptions of the inventions, the nanotechnology, the biological changes of the human race, the almost inevitable merging of man and machine.  The ending, surprisingly, was weak - a little too over the top as if the author could not rest on his laurels. The reader is hit by too many dazzling, out of the world visions and events to enjoy and savor.  All in all a dazzling book for which I am sure there is a sequel. <br /> <br />	2005-09-19

Then think Bram Stoker by a women with Eastern European roots and an American style. Through the eyes of a woman we follow a complex tale of current, past and ancient history. We walk through the mists of time then suddenly return to the present almost at will. The three periods perfectly mesh into a single story.  Like the original Dracula, the tale comes to us mostly through diaries and letters, some modern and others from the mists of history.   <br /> <br />A young woman takes off after her father who leaves, searching for his wife (her mother), long thought dead.  While traveling we learn (through letters) that before she was born her father was on a previous search for his university advisor who himself vanished while researching the historical Drakulya/Vlad Tepes. We journey through time and space - from Turkish invasions and Vlad's rule in Rumania to the dismal \\"People's Republics\\" of Eastern Europe.  The book could almost be a travel guide.  <br /> <br />Two features stand out. First is the literary mood delivered in languid, lush romantic tones.  The research was astounding for this work.  Secondly, it is the \\"historical\\" aspect that makes the story. The searchers are not demon hunting but, using clues from ancient manuscripts, piecing together the life and death of the infamous villian. History is the story of how events in the past affect modern times.  This is NOT a blood fest with screaming teenagers chasing vampiers. It is, instead, fiction that reads as fact. Drakulya looms larger than life and though he is portrayed as a monster in life, he somehow becomes strangley \\"human\\" after his death and rebirth into the world of the undead. The final chapter is haunting, bitter sweet. +++++++	2005-08-07
125878:US	52706646	R1O5VJRFFTJD0J	0743262131	917728591	The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal 1870-1914	Books	5	1	1	N	N	The Stuff of History	I have just got around to reading this book after having read several others by the author.  It is THE definitive work on the Panama Canal. But it is more than a story of digging a ditch.  It is a tale of international intrigue, the rise of the United States into a world power, the slow demise of French influence in the world and of an incredible engineering feat that astounds us today. <br /> <br />The canal started out as a dream:  To travel from Atlantic to Pacific without going around the tip of South America.  France had eliminated the need to round Africa with the Suez Canal and she hoped to do the same here. Yetm despite her educational system, training, history and spirit of achievement she was not up for the task and the result was the end of France as a world power. (She suffered humiliating swift defeats in both World Wars.) <br /> <br />Another sub-story is the location battle.  Panama won through a combination of marketing (smart and deceptive) and luck. This is also the tale of the first modern American president - Teddy Roosevelt. It was his drive, ambition and vision for the nation that propelled him to support such a mission. The United States emerged from the ordeal stronger, a more mature country than when it began, and with a firm start on the road to becoming the technical and industrial giant of the world. This nation of a hundred million folks became a dynamo that affected industry and science from that point on. It was the Panama Canal that started us on this long road. <br /> <br />McCullough writes in a manner similar to Paul Johnson.  He ably combines a historical tale with captivating sagas of individual triumphs and defeats.  This humanizes the story and makes us realize that history is more than dates and battles. In the end, history is about people.	2005-08-07

I note that many reviewers have condemned this book seemingly with a \\"blink of the eye\\".  It has been criticized for lacking technical background, offering too much background, providing too few hard examples, speaking out of context...the list goes on. While the overall structure could be \\"firmed up\\" and some repetition removed, it is still a provocative study of snap judgements and unconscious decision-making. <br /> <br />Many reviewers have confused two distinct issues:  The first one concerns everyone and how they unconsciously hold prejudices and attitudes, mostly cultural, that affect decision-making.  The second concerns those individuals who, after only a sliver of data, can discern truths that stun in their accuracy. The author stresses repeatedly that this second group is NOT a random group of folks from the local bar but is composed of experts in their particular fields - food tasting, military prowess, counseling, \\"reading\\" faces, tennis, insurance, art. etc.   <br /> <br />Many of his \\"solutions\\" for overcoming societal or cultural biases seemed fuzzy at best.  \\"Putting ourselves in situations\\" where we feel comfortable with all types of people sounds great but that is a conscious decision that one must make to affect our unconscious attitudes - a contradiction.  The many tests were interesting and revealing and while some may ask whether only examples were offered that supported the author's thesis, it is safe to say that he is correct in the germ of his argument.  <br /> <br />What I fault the author for is suggesting that anyone can \\"blink\\" like an expert.  That is simply not possible.  All the experts were highly qualified, most all highly educated with curious intellectual abilities not shared with the general populace. His most telling point is that studying of \\"blinking\\" decisions can lead to safer crime patrol, fairer hiring and other admirable societal goals.  A very worthy, provocative read.	2005-07-03

This book studies economics - the science of incentives - and arrives at several startling but explicable answers to several questions.  The \\"story\\" accompanying the particular issue makes this work not only informative but very entertaining.  In essence, the author asks \\"why\\" for several circumstances and arrives at his answer through data and a lot of common sense. <br /> <br />Each and every topic is fascinating - from abortion/no crime to the name game.  Why do we have negative connotations about such names as Trixy and Butch?  (Humorously, even the high-end soaps use names popular with lower income viewers.) what's in a name. Along the way he demonstrates unconscious biases (against old folks and Latinos on game shows - blame our unconscious desire not to hurt blacks or women), why teachers and sumo wrestlers cheat (it all has to do with incentives), the odd relationship betweeen workings of the Ku Klux Klan and realtors and perhaps most telling, the real factors that affect school performance.  In almost every case he turns \\"conventional wisdom\\" on its head as the numbers paint a different tale that what we assume.  <br /> <br />As an aside, the author has expanded on his abortion/crime thesis by positing that it is one of the primary reason for GOP dominance - Democrats are destroying millions of voters. He notes the wide gap in growth between red and blue states and sees no end in sight except, oddly enough, a ban on abortions.  In other words, the very thing one party opposes turns out to be their salvation.  This is classic Levitt as he once again turns conventional wisdom upside down. <br />	2005-07-03

I have read all of them and eagerly await the arrival of the next one.  There are, of course, common themes - the Mississippi setting, the heroes and heroines who are financially successful, the dark shadows in the past and the rational manner in which the story tells itself. <br /> <br />I doubted that he could top the female lead in DEAD SLEEP but he has with Cat Ferry, a forensic expert in bite marks.  That's another thing about a Greg Iles book - you are sure to learn something whether it is oil drilling, art, drugs or how teeth marks are used in solving crimes.  Cat has lots of problems, most of which are resolved only through booze or sex. Yet she is intelligent and realizes her own failings.  The story begins with her in a relationship with a married man, her forte.   <br /> <br />Someone is killing seemingly unrelated older men and biting them. When she faints at a second crime scene and discovers something about her affair (I will not disclose what it was) she returns to her sleepy childhood home and all the terrible memories.  Her soldier father was shot when she was a young girl and the family was raised by a patriarchial grandfather.  When a young girl plays with some of her chemicals she sees two bloody footprints are highlighted - one of a young girl, the other of a man with boots. And when she meets a neighbor, a former male classmate who has lost lots of weight and become a doctor, you know they are destined. <br /> <br />The story successfully combines both tales - her attempt to discover the truth about her father and the investigation into the murders. Alas, there is a link that reveals the truth to both situations.  The story is not for the faint of heart; it is pedophilia in all its tragic variations. Psychology and repressed memories play a large role in this saga. Surprisingly the villian (of sorts), a former college classmate and very famous psychiatrist, steals the show.  His depiction is one of the eeriest and edgiest I have come across lately as the reader is constantly waiting to discover...is he the one? <br /> <br />In the end, long-buried secrets are revealed and the reader is left with the impression that knowledge of these will lead to healing for Cat.  Oh, and she ends up with the doctor.	2005-07-03

This does not approach the magnificent JOHN ADAMS but it does shed light on a subject on which the American populace is woefully ignorant:  The American Revolution.  <br /> <br />More particularly it is the story of one year of that long war, the most important and most tenuous of the entire campaign.  One is simply astounded at the feats of the revolutionaries - fighting without shoes, clothes, pay or guns, taking on the most powerful force on the planet, sticking to their principles in spite of a cascade of setbacks.  The story is, of course, about individuals since in the end, it is the action of the few that determine the outcome of history.  One notes the youth of the colonists, their fervor and beliefs in a country not yet in existence.    <br /> <br />McCullough goes out of his way to be not only fair but also just. His biography of King George is notable for its historical accuracy and its reliance on facts and not legend. The lives of the major characters - British and the American - are detailed. This is also a book about leadership and in particular that of George Washington, the linchpin of the Revolution.  It is fair to say that it would have been a lost cause without him at the helm. It was certainly not his strategic skill that shone - his mistakes, errors and misjudgements are legend.  <br /> <br />Three qualities stand above all others when one reads about the exploits of the Father of the Nation.  The first is his courage and steadfastness in the face of overwhelming odds.  The second is his ability to recognize and rely on superb aides.  The third is his willingness to dare, to cross the river in the middle of the night, to attack on Christmas Day, to know when to run and when to fight.   Reduced to a rag-tag army of 3,000, he led the rebels to major victories over the Hessians and over the British at Trenton.  These twoevents rekindled the fire of hope in the colonists and enabled them to endure year after year of almost unbelievable hardship. <br /> <br />McCullough presents his characters as they were and yet it seems they are larger than life:  Adams crossing the Pyrrenes as an old man, Franklin negotiating and always trying to promote \\"his fair land\\", Hale giving his life, Washington leading the troops and Jefferson and the others knowingly risking their lives by signing the Declaration of Independence.  A magisterial story by an author at the apex of his powers. <br /> <br />	2005-07-03

This was, unfortunately, my first experience with him and it was not a fun time. Stories featuring gay folks as main characters are fine as long as the whole plot does not revolve around the issue.  In this case, the main character is a gay reporter looking for the Big One that would propel him to the major ranks. He's slightly deprecating, funny, unconcerned about his sexual orientation and willing to take chances. Despite a superb opening the book soon becomes laden with so many problems it's hard to know where to begin.  <br /> <br />First off, the unrelenting sex threatens to smother the tale. Not only is the plot sexual (gay pedophilia) but the endless casual, unemotional sex of strangers and friends becomes boring and banal. You see what's going to happen and skip to the next paragraphs.  How many men/young boy/hamesome guy scenarios can there be?  Perhaps Rice was showcasing the extreme elements of the gay community - the meth users, the guys who refuse to grow up and turn to kids for comfort.  Who knows?  <br /> <br />Secondly, there are way too many characters.  As a result, they all get short-changed.  Thirdly, the story rambles and is very disjointed.  The reporter is fired from his gay mag and hired by a famous author for investigation into some murders.  The author also wants the Big Story. The author's wife, an in-your-face black woman, almost steals the show. She is the character who seems most expressive, most endearing, most realistic but then...she's gone.   <br /> <br />Suddenly, halfway through, the story veers in an entirely different direction as we move both location and plot. You shake your head and ask if there is some kind of mistake - are there missing pages?  I'd hazard there are enough tales for two and maybe three books. While the author finally synchronizes the many subplots (well sorta), he cannot overcome the utter confusion caused by one too many plot twistsand the vast array of characters, many of whom are not who they appear.  Hire an editor, dude!  The final chase seems to stretch out to Pluto before fading into a whirlpool of confused action, revelations and resolutions that leave the reader shaking his head. <br /> <br />By the end, the spunky reporter had settled (at least for a night) with a sad young man who pops up in the story every now and then and seems pitiful at best. Maybe that's indicative of the story - A meets B, A loses B, B disappears, A discovers B is not who he thinks, B goes crazy, A ends up with C. <br />Go figure.	2005-07-03

Reading the preceding books in this series is imperative if one is to begin to understand this one.  First of all, the terms would be completely foreign and secondly, it is important to understand the history of the Queendom, the Faxes and the revolution of human beings into immortal creatures.   <br /> <br />I hope that the lack of reviews is not indicative of a lack of readers because this is an important book in an important series that touches on cutting edge science (the author is involved in a nanotech company) and the future of humanity.  What would it mean if it were possible to pass through a human fax machine and have your body emerge as a healthy man or woman in their mid-twenties? For one, immortality would increase population and that is one of the problems faced here.  Secondly it leads to all sorts of weird experiments as groups of people become less and less human.  <br /> <br />But this is a story about relationships, the wonders of science (in particular the awesome \\"Wellstone\\") and the exploits of King Bruno and once badboy Conrad Mursk.  The action is top notch, logical and exciting.  The science is mind-blowing but utterly believable. The tale itself is bittersweet but the ending more than makes up for any sadness and a sequeal is suggested. For a literate, entertaining and masterful work of art, it is hard to beat.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-03

He is essentially saying that the philosophical edifice of his previous life was based on what he has come to believe is a lie. Unlike many unbelievers, he does not yell or rail against believers or the Church as an institution, not does he seem to have any scores to settle. Instead, his tone is one of sadness and regret, personal remorse and respect for those who keep the faith that sustained him and has millions of others.  He understands the allure of religion, particularly it a social setting.  It is one thing not to attend a church; it is quite something else to declare one's opposition to religious teachings.    <br /> <br />This is not a literary masterpiece but it is a searching tale of how individual thinking, reason and analysis can lead someone to reject the very foundations of his life.  Something of this order occurred when the USSR ceased and honest Socialists admitted that their vision of economics, history and human  motivations were abysmally wrong. But religion touches the soul in ways that ideology cannot since it concerns not only the here but the hereafter. While for some, politics is simply another religion, to the vast majority there is a distinct difference. <br /> <br />Templeton traces his life as a convert, scholar and preacher. It appears (and I suspect) there was always a seed of doubt that he sought to banish through good deeds, prayer and simply not entertaining the idea that Christianity is an inspiring fraud.  Yet it is our mental faculties which ultimately propel us forward, giving rise to inventions that save labor and pain, to medicines that heal bodies and to material benefits that provide us time to muse on the things of the spirit.  <br /> <br />One reason why his experience is rare is that few take the time to study the origins of their religion, read critical analyses butsimply accept current teachings wihout wondering how they came to be.  He had to overcome shame, a sense of personal failure, the task of telling those he loved that he had made such a decision and yet...he seems to have been set free.   A great read.	2005-06-24

The good thing about all the sex scenes is that they mesh so well with the flow of the story - nothing is gratuitous.  Once again, we are in Natchez, Mississippi and once again the hero is intelligent, married, successful and burdened with a dark past. (Despite the same approach in almost every novel it never tires.)  Add a devastated wife who rises to the occasion, a partner of questionable morals and a lawyer turned novelist and you know you are in for another good read. <br /> <br />A mysterious woman, the vamp of the city, approaches Harper and whispers a word that only his former lover, now dead, could possibly know.  As the story progresses he becomes convinced that the woman somehow has the soul of his dead lover. But he is the only one who believes that (including the reader).  The action gets hotter - in more ways than one - as you discover that the woman claims sex is the vehicle for soul migration. Yet Iles never descends below the very soft porn ladder as the story continues to dominate the book.  It has a shocking but satisfying ending.	2005-06-12

On the one hand, the party supports almost unlimited individual rights on almost any issue.  At the same time, the party is inundated with identity politics and group rights - women's rights, gay rights, Latino rights, prisoner rights, minority rights. Those two ideas are fundamentally in conflict. Books on Democrats focus on the hot-button popular issues - abortion, gays, minority rights, taxes, the military, entitlements, etc.  Rarely are the overriding issues of the nation faced - what is the role of our nation as a beacon for democracy, what do we want as a people, what path will lead to continued success in the future?     <br /> <br />One point: The author fails to note that many ideas associated with the Party are not held by all democrats. Minorities, a huge component (perhaps THE most consistent one), are much more conservative than the \\"leaders\\" of the party.  Southern and Midwestern Democrats also tilt right of the leadership yet the author is correct in pointing out that it is the most leftwing view that eventually becomes predominant in the party.  <br /> <br />The modern struggle for political dominance can be defined by four \\"groups\\" or ideas: Academia, a hotbed of leftist politics, the media, losing respect and its old Northeast perspective, the rise of religion in politics and lastly the recent unease with all things military by Democrats.  These four components shape modern American politics and the author discusses these to some extent but only in concrete, not theoretical or predictive terms. What does it mean when 90% of academica support a candidate that received 48% of the vote? Or that a religious (or non-religious) test is almost a requirement? Do we have a permanent dichotomy within our nation? <br /> <br />Most Democrats would not take chances with national security though some would.  Most Democrats would not increasetaxes and crush the life of the economy though some would.  Most would not refrain from the use of military force though some would. Most would not want to completely sever all mention of religion from the public arena though some would.  Unfortunately, the \\"some\\" in the previous sentences include much of the current leadership and perhaps that is the problem.	2005-06-12

He is a genuinely warm human being with a zeal for space, scientific discovery and belief in the ultimate success of our race in solving grand problems. He knows that not everyone will be pleased with his methodical, elaborate and sensitive writings and that does not bother him. He writes what he must and so be it.  In the past I have criticized his work for having too many minor characters but in this case they all \\"fit\\".  <br /> <br />We return with the heroes of A TALENT FOR WAR, one of the best books (not just sci-fi) every written.  Alex and Chase, one-time lovers, are high-end antique dealers who get ensnared in a sixty year-old mystery. The spaceship POLARIS flew with a stellar crew to observe the meeting of a star and quasar. The crew simply disappeared causing galaxy wide upheavals that lasted for years.  The mystery was never explained. A Startrek-like cult (hilariously described down to convention goers) has sprung up around this event even with numerous explanations. Chase gets a chance to auction items from the Polaris and that's when the fun begins.  <br /> <br />This is a grand mystery, replete with chase scenes, double crossing, intrigue and pathos. In fact, add a love interest and it would make a great movie.  One clue leads to the next and all the while the author muses on subjects varying from the meaning of death, religion, immortality, the meaning of consciousness and the problem of affluency.  In the end, the pair discover the truth which leads to an explosive if perhaps not final conclusion.  <br /> <br />As in all McDevitt novels, the characters are intelligent, rational, and slightly self-deprecating. The first person narrative by Chase was superb.  McDevitt excels in portraying strong, intelligent females and this is no exception.  This is not WAR of the WORLDS or punk scifi or the weird worlds of PK Dick but it is vintage McDevitt and it is good.	2005-05-29

But this is it.  I judge a story by its  characters, plot and writing and SUNBORN flunks all three. As usual, everyone is two-dimensional - aliens and humans - more  caricature than character. Their speech sounds like something from a scifi book - &#34;We are the OGOGO from the planet NCHYDHH and we come in peace, blah blah&#34; The Russian still does not use indefinite articles after 20 years and comes off sounding like a cave man.  Benford is at his best when describing modern scientific theory but when he turns to intimacy - family chats, friendship, romantic sweet talk - dialogue becomes clumsy and amateurish.  The plot?  We mmet the Adam & Eve of the Red Planet, a pair of astronauts who have become media stars for a mega corporation. The author's knowledge of economics seems limited to supposed back room chatter and the evils of BIG business. A company rep arrives and suddenly the two are sent to...Pluto(!) and meet none other than the daughter of the CEO(!!) who has discovered alien life forms(!!!).  How many ways can you say &#34;cliche&#34;?  Here it breaks down completely.  Benford may be a whiz in the hard sciences but when it comes to notions of consciousness and intelligence it's a disaster. The aliens hail from the Oort Region beyond the Solar System and here's the rub: Their speech (presented in &#60; &#62;) is anthropomorphic reflecting human needs, desires and psychology yet they do not possess the neurological basis or evolution for such attitudes.  No creature in the galaxy can approximate the human condition without sensory input like humans.  Anyway, a lot of nothing goes on and the ships return to Mars for more meandering and musings.  Perhaps it is Benford's zeal for scientific accuracy that has prevented him from being a visionary writer.  His stories are rooted firmly in the here and now but sometimes authors need to spread their wings and soar on flights ofimagination.	2005-05-24

But sometimes we don't want challenging tomes that provoke the imagination...sometimes we just want to have fun and that is what Gould delivers.  You must read the preceding book, JUMPER, a slightly superior work for its originality. This is the stuff of fantasy, something we all have dreamed about.  After ten years, Davy and Millie are stuffed with cash but not with children.  One morning, after a fight, Davy jumps and does not return.  So begins the saga.   <br /> <br />Davy has been captured and implanted with a device that enforces a barrier so completely that he will literall die of convulsions if he \\"jumps\\" outside the box.  The rest of the book alternates between his attempts at fighting his new masters and Millie's attempts to find him.  About 2/3 of the way into the book Millie learns to teleport and the rest is history. <br /> <br />Despite the rather simplistic plotting, the characters are more than two-dimensional caricatures.  Davy and Millie, through their thoughts, reveal themselves as earnest, intelligent and caring people.   I loved the book, particularly the ending which coule be an opening for another in the series. <br />	2005-05-18

His weakest link has always been characterization - dialogue and emotional growth. Everyone is one-dimensional and they speak in \\"bookese\\", that stuff one never hears in real life. \\"Great\\" folks utter stirring phrases while the masses speak of politics constantly. His attempts at casual conversation are a disaster. <br />  <br />Let's start with the obvious - this is a thinly veiled retelling of the end of communism...a young progressive becomes leader (Gorbachev), the mayor of the capital supports him (Yeltsin),  hardliners reject and kidnap him, crowds rush into the street, nations break away, blah blah. There is an illogical dichotomy of the masses - one minute they're lobotomized robots living in terror, the next they're in the streets shouting for freedom. It makes no sense whatsoever. <br /> <br />But the worst sin is iterary - he bores.  The \\"plot\\" consists of mundane family conversations, arguments between sisters, bridge games, dinners, watching TV, boring work, repeating over and over until one is desperate for a hint of plot movement.  His depiction of a state in which every facet of existence is viewed through ideological means was well done:  \\"The Party is right; truth is relative.\\"  It's in the details of daily life that he falters. School consists of a paddle-wielding teacher who daily points to a map of the huge German Empire while engaging in elementary propaganda.  <br /> <br />Good points?  The idea of a more liberal first edition of Mein Kampf, the young girl who learns that she is a Jew and that's about it. If you don't mind imitation, stilted characters and dialogue and a preposterous resolution, this is the book for you.	2005-05-12

No two are exactly alike and yet there are common elements.  The most obvious one is the setting, the Mississppi Delta and the South in general.  But there is another, less obvious but more appealing characteristic:  Most characters and particularly the good guys are intelligent, troubled souls with a depth rarely found in modern literature.   <br /> <br />In this case, it was as near perfect as possible:  The opening pages of pure terror, the introduction to the \\"perfect\\" family with all their troubles, the bravura of the hero and the heroine and their daughters.  I started to say this would make a good movie then I find out it already has though under a different name. The good guys fight back - not with brawn but with brains. Iles has always extolled the smart, \\"doers\\" of our society who have worked hard and enjoy the fruits of their labors without guilt or angst. In this case, with the doctors, he is right on target. <br /> <br />Almost as good is the portrayal of the bad guys.  Again we have multifaceted characters that seem to step out of the pages. Especially touching was the slow-thinking giant who fell for the little girl.  A fast-paced thriller from the first to the last page.	2005-05-10

This is NOT a political tome although politics, by necessity, is part of the discussion.  The subject is not really original either - others have mulled over both the future and the shrinking nature of the world.  What Friedman has done is offer analysis of historical events, project future trends and in general expound upon globalization and its effects. He does all this in such an intelligent prose that one is transported back to the days when public figures were actually literate.   <br /> <br />He touches on most of the major issues - trade, knowledge, health care, education, work, etc - but concentrates on education, competitions, employment and most importantly, attitude.  The main reason for America's success is an environment in which individuals have been free to experiment, produce and thrive. There is also the subject of \\"human capital\\", its investment in its people and their education.  He has correctly identified this asset as one of the utmost importance, particularly in the light of the uproar over \\"outsourcing\\", a common sense practice that has existed for thousands of years. The idea of hiring workers for a lower wage will always be with us.  Germans employs Americans who employ Mexicans who employ Guatemalans - all for the same reason.   <br /> <br />He hit on something important when he stresses that continual education and training are necessary to meet the challenges of world competition.  As old industries wither due to competition or technological changes, we must be prepared for the next phase. As the world gets flatter, resources are leveling out.  The discussion on the Mideast was good if slightly optimistic. This is a good and important book.	2005-05-10

Rarely does someone succeed on all levels but in this case Iles comes close.   First of all, he succeeds on a literary level.  The writing is erudite, mesemrizing, even poetic.  One is drawn to Harper Cole and his life instantly.  An options trader by day, erotic web site sysops by night, he becomes involved in a something that spins out of control. The fact that he is married, lives in Mississippi and has deep and dark secrets of his own only adds to the story. <br /> <br />Yes, there is a serial killer but he is not your average \\"capture torture mutilate\\" slug.  There is something going on that escapes detection except to those few with the intelligence to ask questions.  This brings me to another strong point of the book:  All four main characters (including the bad guy) are very smart and this is reflected not only in their conversations but in their very lives - their actions and feelings.   <br /> <br />The killer in this case is not a \\"stranger beside you\\" but a true stranger whose own life contains enough material for a room of psychiatric couches.  He is a gifted, driven pathetic creature who shows that genius does not lead to logical thinking or moral actions.  Everyone in the story makes moral choices and all pay the consequences.  Another good offering by Iles.	2005-04-24

The book uses a phrase that aptly describes the situation: lifestyle socialism. This is not legislating morality from the bench. Instead, it is forcing upon society, through judicial fiat, minority ideas that would never succeed in the proper law-making body (Congress). A long list comes to mind: Banning the Scouts, burning the flag, the war against religious references and symbols, abortion on demand, busing for enforced equality (an oxymoron), prisoner's rights (quote unquote), suing for lack of responsibility such as smoking or overeating. <br /> <br />He explains persuasively that this did not occur overnight but was a result of several factors - the monolithic leftism of academia, the one-world view of the major media and how one case of activism encourages others. Bork also explains not only the decisions but also the motives behind these decisions. As he has written and stated, frequently these are not conscious decisions but instead are responses to an anticipated reaction.  Judges, like all people, respond to praise and comdemnation.  They win accolades from society's elite - academia, NPR, CNN, Wash Post, Times, Hollywood - if they rule a certain way. They are also aware of the consequences of displeasing these groups. Once the Left realized its agenda would not advance in the legislature they turned to the courts.  <br /> <br />The scariest part, and one that he alludes to, is what happens when people draw the line, when they say \\"that's enought\\"? We  always been a nation of laws but paradoxically the relentless assault from the bench by those who legislate rather than judge will ultimately lead to a reduction of their power. Israel and Canada, two examples in his book, are close to reaching that point. He is not optimistic but not a complete pessimist. The book is not weightt, an easy read for the knowledgable layman.	2005-04-01

To paraphrase a popular show, \\"How does she do that?\\" By \\"that\\" I mean spinn intricate, intelligent, edgy tales with characters that evolve and capture the imagination? This is prose taken to a higher plane, one in which every decision, plot twist or description is another cog in the grand scheme of things. The subjects are depressing - pedophilia and murder - and for the first time a serial killer is introduced. This is not some cheap slash tale but instead a piercing, almost scathing, look at modern England, the results of living without rules or fathers, the state of race relation and the sterility of British society. <br /> <br />The author excells in \\"natural\\" - as opposed to scripted - conversation. The plot is one of subtle layers, boxes in boxes, a tour de force that intertweaves individuals, relationships and the story into a complex web.  She follows a pattern established in earlier books - the main crime serves as the device for revelation of other deep, dark secrets. Her treatment of the lost children of modern society is one of the best - sympathy mixed with hard-headed analysis of consequences.   <br /> <br />Lynley is his usual emoting self, St. James and Deborah make cameo appearances and Helen...well, let's say that she will not be forgotten.  My favorite, Havers, doggedly persists in bucking Scotland Yard even as she battles her own inner demons.  The scene with the Bentley not only was perfect but plausible. Each  character in the book is presented with all their problems, secrets and hopes.     <br /> <br />Her portrayal of the pedophiles is judicious, even-handed as we learn that their present was set far in the past through the same abuse they now display. This is far too complex a novel to decipher in a few paragraphs.  Needless to say, if you have read an Elizabeth George novel before, this will be your \\"cup of tea\\".	2005-03-29

He is a regular contributor to Jewish World Review (subscribe - it's free!) and startles the reader with clarity and the ability to see beyond the headlines and sound bites.  Here, he takes yet another look at the future with regard to radical and moderate Islam. <br /> <br />Pipe journeys from the past to the present. He suggests ways of  breaking the stalemate but falters when discussing \\"moderate\\" Muslims and their ability to change the status quo. One should remember that all Muslims are fundamentalists in that they interpret the Q'ran literally and view it as a guide for modern living. There is no liberal branch of Islam like Reform Judaism or Unitarianism.  Another seemingly tabboo subject is tribalism which is at the core of many problems. The failure of modern Muslim states is directly due to the primary allegiance given to Islam and the tribe. Objections or protests are seen as disloyal at best, heretical at worst. When reality is viewed through a rigid religious or ideological prism only cosmetic changes are possible.  <br /> <br />Compare the Holy Roman Empire and the Renaissance Europe that blossomed once the hold of the Church over every aspect of society declined.  The society questioned itself and found a new pathway.  This internal questioning has yet to occur in Islamic societies that continue to seatch the past for guidance in the future. Pipes (and most of us) envisions a future world in which tolerance is the norm.  I fear that vision is ephemeral at best. <br />   <br /> <br />	2005-03-22

As late as 1967, Europe overwhelming support the Jewish state. Then came the oil embargo and France raised the white flag, switching allegiances in midstream. Others followed suit and today Israel (and Jews) are as isolated and resented across the continent as ever before. The question of why a society of alleged admirers of freedom prefer primitive dictatorships to a Western, open society is never raised. The answer would be too embarrassing. It's not only the Left but every facet of European society that demonizes \\"Zionists\\". Who says that unremitting propaganda does not work? <br /> <br />This is a story within a story.  The larger picture is the total disentegration of Europe as a culture. Gone are former ties of religion, democracy and muscular nationalism.  Instead there is a squishy socialism, a beauracracy of nobodies and a rampant loss of respect for any value except skepticism. Europe has made her decision to exit with a whimper rather than a bang. I am not sold on the author's insistence that there is a formal agreement between the two parties but that hardly matters.  Both sides implicitely understand the arrangement - Europe is to lend unwavering support to the Arab cause, stop all aid to Israel, and in return will be given an easier slavery. <br /> <br />One sees the results of this alliance everywhere- agreement with Muslim demands, rabid anti-Americanism, support for \\"Palestine\\", scorn of democracy in the Middle East. Defense is redefined as slow surrender and an obsession to please at all costs. The other side does not matter - Iran, Iraq, China, Arabia - they are all to be placated with nice words and hard cash. And though I can buy the arguement that initially it was strictly monetary, the fact is that philosophically, Europe has crossed the Rubicon and is on a road with no return.  <br /> <br />The author points out that most Europeans have knowledge of the dhimmitude within a Muslim society yet have inexplicably chosen this pathway.  And unlike the Greeks, whose culture survived centuries of occupation, modern Europe has neither the will nor soul to fight. This book should server as a warning to all who say that values are not important.  The future dhimmitude of Europe is the best antitode of that idea.	2005-03-18

I like Jim Rogers's style; it is intelligent, well-reasoned and informative.  It is the substance that causes problems starting with the title.  If \\"Anyone\\" could invest profitably in the world's be market we would all be sitting at our PCs trading  coffee, coal and tea futures left and right (as many did during the tech boom).  If \\"Anyone\\" was prescience about commodities, it would be the first time considering the experts (quote unquote) caught off guard by the drop in silver, rise in coffee, the glut (then shortage) of oil and last, but not least, the huge drop in the market itself. <br /> <br />If you are looking for general information about the \\"market of markets\\" along with a little history, some geopolitcal musings and some common sense approaches, this is the book for you. If, instead, you want to make a fortune you would be better served attending a seminar on buying and selling property \\"with no money down.\\" (&lt;--- a joke) That's the problem with guides of this sort - they attract those who think the \\"Big Boys\\" have a secret, get-rich-quick scheme that does not involve hard work, research and risks.   <br /> <br />This is a notch above others of this genre but please keep in mind that \\"oil would never rise about $30/barrel\\", the Dow would hit 35,000 or 100,000 (take your pick) and gold prices would soar through the roof. All of these ideas were the subject of best sellers whose fans defended them ferociously.  Some convinced even \\"experts\\" in the field since their arguement, in a vaccuum, sounded not only reasonable but plausible.  As one reviewer notes, the author favors China over over Asian countries and gives good reason why.  This part (the geopolitical) may be some of the best insights in the book.	2005-03-14

His first person narratives are some of the best. Only rarely does he write from the omniscent point of view. This book goes in a decidedly different direction than most of his previous ones and is better for it. Gones are monsters, aliens, evil towns or raging computers.  <br /> <br />Instead we meet Jimmy Tock, faithful son, baker and writer, in what becomes a virtual biography.  How well the separate pieces mesh - from the bakery with the many allusions to fine food to the initial meeting of the spunky, unforgettable Lorrie to the mad son/brother who somehow obtained redemption for his pathetic, sorrowful life.  The idea of five dates of destiny is a great plot device - knowing when something will happen but helpless to prevent it.   <br /> <br />What is there not to like?  The love story is the best he has penned since the fabulous WATCHER. The intentional twists he throws keep the reader alert. The language is rich, rollicking and original. The bad guys are bad, the good guys good. This is a story about authenticity: What makes a true parent, husband, wife and son and even more, what does not. But most importantly, Koontz (through the words of Jimmy) says that life expectancy is measured by the quality and not quantity of years lived. Highly recommended.	2005-03-13

I was told it was an adult version of Harry Potter and was interested. After all, I read the first Harry Potter to my sons when they were younger and both liked the series.  However, one should define what is meant by \\"adult\\". If it means using mind-numbing descriptions in the most flowery language possible with arcane spelling (I know it's suppose to be \\"authentic\\") then this is an \\"adult\\" tale.   <br /> <br />Any decent editor would have snipped a good third of the book away as excess verbiage - writing for the sake of accumulating letters. The story - as other reviewers have pointed out - moves at the pace of a crippled snail; the mind wanders as the brain fights to wade through still more dreary descriptions that seem so unimportant. Once again, the idea was excellent - magicians arising in England, the interplay between government and magic, the late introduction of the titled \\"Mr. Strange\\", his fascination with magicians of old.  I am not the only one I've talked to who thought the tale overly long, underplotted, the characters too numerous and shallow.  The magic is, how to say it, underwhelming.  <br /> <br />Mr. Norrell is, without a doubt, one of the most boring - and forgettable - characters in modern literature.  He seems to be a    caricature rather than a character. The work, which requires much concentration getting starting, is written in the \\"Old Style\\", that is odd lettering, idiom, manner, names, places.  It reminds one of one of those incredibly boring plays about Ladies and Lords (no lower clases are present) of pre-Victorian England whose action alternates between drawing rooms, friendly pubs and darkened corridors.  The cover is impressive as are the blurb, recommendations and author's bio.  I only wish the story had been half as good.     <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-13

The story is so well known that I will not go into it.  Needless to say she is a special person because of her facility.  It allows her (she thinks) to form a special bond with them because she believes she understands their perspective on the world.  That may of may not be true - anecdotal evidence is not scientific proof.  After all, to the normal person, the world appears flat, not round, and it seems heavier objects do fall faster than light ones. <br /> <br />One thing that cannot be denied is her influence in the meat industry where, after years of talking and experimenting, she came up with a more \\"humane\\" way of conducting the slaughter of animals for food.  What is not clear is if that experience so colored her outlook that she views everything through that lens. The author is at her best when describing her trials, feelings and emotions.  Things are on shakier ground when she attempts to relate her condition with animal behavior.  The two situations may be similar but not for the same reason.  This is a fascinating book that deserves a read even if one disagrees with some of the premises.	2005-03-11

He does so elegantly, enlightening and entertaining along the way. It may shock those who think we've always held the beliefs we now hold and that these beliefs arrived fully developed without undergoing all the development associated with such ideas. The author is authoritative and sympathetic as we wind through the ages, civilization upon end, rewriting not only the rules but also the game. <br /> <br />Starting with the unchanging Egyptians one discovers that they indeed changed their beliefs about life after death, not once but several times. Then the citizens of Ur take center stage.  On and on we move, ancient Persia, Greece and finally the dawn of our modern Western ideas, Israel.  It is difficult to call one view more \\"sophisticated\\" than another due to the transmission and borrowing of ideas between cultures.  Each new encounter led to another modification.  <br /> <br />The primary question had to be decided...\\"Is there life after death?\\" Most cultures concluded that \\"something\\" existed beyond death. (Oddly, the Old Testament is silent on the subject.) They were unsure where it was or what occurred. Religious leaders and rulers were included (of course) then a new idea of titantic import emerged, one that affects us to this day: All who lead \\"good lives\\" (honored rulers and gods, obeyed social rules) are eligible for eternal bliss. Its corollarly - bad people get punished - was a natural development.   <br /> <br />Our ideas of an afterlife had evolved from a dark existence to a an opulent physical place to a democratic mystical union with Christ in \\"heaven\\". The idea of resurrection muddied the waters but stopped debate on the subject.  Christianity substituted \\"being in Christ\\" for a physical place while Islam's version promises sensuousness and pleasure for ever.  A well-researched and well-written book - get it today.	2005-03-08

Exploiting human misery, though, is a booming cottage industry.   <br />Michael Moore makes millions off sufferings from terrorism, school shootings and war.  The Buckingham Palace crew has reaped profits from the shoddy Princess Di \\"story\\".  Associates of Bill Clinton went to the bank with derogatory stories about their \\"friend\\".  <br /> <br />This is the latest twist - an admission/confession/explanation in which relatives/friends bare all. As far as evidence goes, it adds absolutely nothing except a resolve that this man had the capacity to do what he did.  As a father of adopted children her take was interesting but she needs to resolve some issues. His family life may be interesting but who really wants all these lurid details about this disturbed individual?  This was better than the awful tome by Scott's \\"girlfriend\\", Amber, but that isn't saying much.  Speaking of \\"girlfriend\\", isn't it amazing how easy we adjust to media talk? <br /> <br />Now that Scott is convicted, I hope Ms, Bird finds some inner peace and closure to what seems like a life of suppressed anger. As for as uncovering the \\"real\\" Scott Peterson, that will have to wait for another day when someone more objective can look at the situation.	2005-03-06

Right off the bat Eker gives bad advice.  The best way to become wealthy is not to save or educate yourself or study the stock market. No, the easiest method is giving seminars to desperate folks and writing schlock like this.  Degree, investments and skills are optional.  <br /> <br />This book is so bad it is almost good and if you are serious about literature or prose you are barking up the wrong tree.  I have a deep aversion to tomes of this type, you know the ones that claim some \\"secret\\" pathway to wealth and then are purposely vague so as to avoid any legal ramifications.  Yet someone lent me a copy and in my spare time I gave it a quick once over.  I'll even admit, to my utmost humiliation, that a long time ago I attended one of those crappy seminars where a cheerleader got all the poor fools excited about swimming in cash. <br /> <br />The author, probably president of his high school pep club, delivers the goods in that it is exactly like all the 19 zillion other books similar to this, only with an expanded group of \\"experts\\" cited. As one reviewer notes, they are cited endlessly, either with or without quotes. It goes without saying that there is nothing original here - no secret formula, hidden meaning or a jump start on the journey to success.  The name says it all, the \\"Inner Game\\".  People like this view wealth accumulation as a \\"game\\" (God save us from these endless sports metaphors) that must be played by rugged all-American men (and women they hastily  add). <br /> <br />There IS no mindset that leads to wealth except one that values hard work, discipline, education and the capacity to take risks. And despite protests, I can only think that this was one long advertisement for his seminars.  It is amazing the money that Joe and Jane fork over for someone to tell them they need to save, cut expenses and make better investments.  I am normally against forcing labels on products but in this case I will make an exception.  \\"WARNING, THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH\\".	2005-03-06

Why Amazon shows this as a just-released book is odd; I saw it in a bookstore some time ago.  It is, without a doubt, one of the most beautifully realized works to appear in some time.  Its 200 pages are divided into description and a stunning photograph. The book appeals to all levels.   <br /> <br />At a dinner party its placement on the coffee table is sure to engender conversation...\\"May I top off your drink while we review the Earring Dollar?\\"  As a historical tome it presents the social, political and economic forces at work when these were minted.  And for the coin lover it is pure \\"gold\\", a work that is simultaneously interesting, informative and pleasing to the eye.  <br /> <br />The list, from a survey of the Professional Numismatists Guild, includes some well-known and some not so popular coins.  One may argue with the list but it was composed by the best experts in the field and based on a criterion the uninitiated cannot understand. Of course there is the 1804 Silver Dollar (which we now know was not even minted in that year).  There is also (in my opinion) an abundance of gold vs silver and copper.  Yes, they are stunning coins and yes they are exorbitantly priced but they are not as well known.  How many folks, for example, are aware that a four dollar gold piece was once issued?   <br /> <br />Needless to say, the coins presented here are beyond the reach of the ordinary layman - or even the extraordinary one in some cases.  But you can look and dream to your heart's content with this edition.	2005-03-06

As one reviewer so aptly notes, there is not a thing in here that someone with an IQ above 85 could not find out for themselves with a smidgen of research. <br /> <br />I have long decried Disneyworld and its clones as presenting the worst possible image of America to the outside world. My wife and I went the first month it opened when there was hope and expectations that a new vision of the future was in the offing.  We took behind-the-scenes guided tours, talked to the designers and builders about food production, communications, travel and knowledge, ate at the (then) fabulous restaurants and had a wonderful time.  <br /> <br />Years later we \\"won\\" a trip with our first son and noticed a  qualitative change downward.  The last time we returned with both boys we encountered a nightmare of horrible fast food at gourmet prices, dumbed-down exhibits, exorbitantly-priced souvenirs and the ubiquitous video games. One huge arcade was jammed from morning to night with folks who spent hundreds of dollars in order to...play video games.  <br /> <br />This book gives almost no insight into either the background, philosphy (ha ha) or even ideas behind the packed restaurants. The idea of a peaceful union of disparate nations is mentioned then forgotten.  I realize with the continual change it is difficult to be definitive but the prose about \\"fantastic seafood\\", \\"famous chefs\\" and \\"good times\\" definitely tilted toward the latter.  I mean, how much reading to you need to learn that one must reservations early or that some restaurants are more suited for adults. And if you are want something on the serious, probing side - I almost said \\"intellectual\\" - well you can fuhgetaboutit.  <br /> <br />I did not learn anything of significance from this little guide. In summary, this is a hack job for an outrageously expensive amusement park that still pretends to be something it is not. The book falls into that same category.	2005-03-04

The notion that we may be able to view other worlds in incredible detail is not new, but the idea that the method for doing so involves an evolving, \\"living\\", machine may be.  The blurb sounded convincing even if a little vague. <br /> <br />Where to start?  First of all, the \\"literary\\" qualities are, how to say this, lacking at best.  I'm not asking for \\"Dune\\" or \\"Shore of Women\\" or \\"Infinity Beach\\".  I would perfer, though, that the book not employ size 14 font and use only half the first page of each chapter (for unexplained reasons). Dialogue is fakey, like what people say in books instead of real life. The romance (quote unquote) is strictly amateur stuff. There are so many characters that individual detail is impossible and all are superficial stereotypes. ..troubled girl, vengeful, divorced dad,  cynical reporter, sneaky secretary, religious fraud.  Not one stays with the reader after the last page.  The occasional and gratuitous use of the \\"F\\" word sounds phony and forced - shock value that is not shocking. <br /> <br />The \\"shutdown\\" (the cored of the story) is handled clumsily, never fully explained and the science, particularly \\"Mirror Girl\\" & Starfish, is just plain hokey.  In fact, the relationship between the star, Mirror Girl, Tess and telescope remains fuzzy at the end.  This is a case of the plot  determining events - exactly opposite of what it should be. Of course there is a happy ending yet the introduction of aliens to our planets is greeted with a yawn. Their presence, even their existence, is about as noteworthy as a bad storm. The people in the story seems as confused by them as the reader is.	2005-02-21

Like the X-Files, it is the mythology of the Company and not the agents's adventures that beckon.  I mean, if there is a choice between retrieving an extinct hemlock or understanding what happens at the \\"end of time\\" which would you pick?   <br /> <br />The first chapter captivates - the ever-sardonic Mendoza who, despite all the frenetic activity, remains the heart and soul of the saga.  She is trapped but placid, waiting for the inevitable arrival of her lover of the ages.  And sure enough he arrived, probably because it is recorded in the mysterious record kept by Dr. Zeus of all historical events. (History cannot be changed we are repeately told.)  <br /> <br />Again we wax literary with faux sidetrips to England and a trio of ultra-engineers who are interested in the past - a device that could have grown stale but remained fresh.  They develop a plan (or so they think) for creating a benevolent Messiah.  He is, of course, Mendoza's love - Edward, Nichalous and now Alec.  By the way, the Puritans won the battle. For the \\"good of the people\\", society has banned meat, liquor, cigarettes, sugar, strenuous games, \\"anti-social\\" activity, religion, deep emotions. It is a culture both bland and sterile with dwindling kids and emotions.  <br /> <br />Even the best-laid plans go awry.  In this case, it is a toy for the young Alec and it becomes an important part of his life as it evolves from tutor to helper to confidant to Confessor.  Behind all the myriad events is the ubiquitous Dr. Zeus - man or machine? - pushing buttons, manipulating people, going to any lengths to keep the upper hand.  The book concludes right before the end of history - just in time for another novel with Alec and Mendoza. I can't wait.	2005-02-16

It was released in honor of the composer on the 50th anniversary of his death. Martin Jean is, of course, a genius (one would have to be just to interpret the music)and has won acclaim in Europe, France in particular, for his authentic and intelligent renderings and for musicianship of the highest order. (He was honored by being selected as a judge at the 1998 Chartres competition.) But let's be honest - the Woolsey Hall Organ at Yale cannot approach those of the greatest organ maker of all time, Aristide Cavaill-Coll. His pieces have an almost hypnotic quality with the unique \\"orchestral\\" sound so different than Germanic organs. That brings me to a referral - the complete Symphonies by Oosten on three Cavaill-Coll organs. <br /> <br />These interpretations are individualistic - much like the composer. Compare the one-of-a-kind, demonic Scherzo of the 6th Symphony by each performer for an idea of the difference in approach. I prefer Oosten's for its \\"spookiness\\" due in part to the great Rouen organ. Or the last movement of the Fourth Symphony with its opening chromaticism that seems to shimmer in the light of the French organ. I especially enjoyed the last three Symphonies, those that present the greatest challenge to the performer. Again, the virtuosity and individuality are always on display - if only he could have recorded these on one of the CC organs!	2005-02-10

On MLK day I found myself alone, the family gone out all day. I start a fire, pour a glass of wine and settle down. Twelve hours later I finish the last chapter and close the pages quietly. What an original, thought-provoking, tender book!  And to think, it is a story as trite and as old as humankind - romantic love. It is rare that one finds such a good combination of plot, intelligent dialogue and characters so real you are sure Clare is in the next room or Henry is about to appear at your feet (naked of course).<br /><br />There are so many fine touches...The structure itself runs chronologically (sort of) and the \\"trick\\" of displaying the ages sounds hokey but somehow works.  The small vignettes weave, intersect and finally merge into a mesmerizing saga, a torrent of words that are deeply affecting.  There is tension and humor and disappointment and sadness but in the end it is that most human of emotions, love, that remains.  And that is what the book is all about - a love \\"for the ages\\", one that you could say stands the test of time. Not only did the main characters \\"evolve\\" but so did their families. Every family has its skeletons in the closet but rarely has there been a better revelation of these with such subtlety and power.  Secondary characters were, well,  secondary for the heart and soul of the story are Henry and Clare.<br /><br />One must not forget the most important aspect of the book - its literary qualities.  It succeeds where others fail in that all -  and not just some - of the components are excellent. The language is subtle, brilliant, bordering on the poetic at times.  The dialogue is sincere and realistic. The Chicago setting revels in authenticity. The science fiction aspect is always in the background, a necessary component that fits masterfully within the story.  I would love to read a sequeal involving the daughter.	2005-01-20

It pays homage to le Carre in both spirit and soul.  It is emblematic of the hollowness that is modern Britain.  Vanished are the old qualities of patriotism, idealism, faith, allegiance and moral purpose.  Instead, we are left with characters who are little more than amoral automatons going through existential motions.  Yet both Charley and George fight to live even if they have nothing to live for.<br /><br />The writing is cutting, edgy, even poetic at times in its descriptions of an alternate world of murder without question, secrecy for its own sake, neuroticism to the point of psychosis. The setting and opening were so well designed - from the curious tracking of a mand and woman to the reader's discovery of their true identity to the shocking discovery of their mission.  Their almost primordial survival instincts make for great action-packed reading and the occasional lapse into that forbidden area - romantic love - provided depth and even pathos.<br /><br />There is a beauty in the telling of the spy chief, again symbolic of the modern British spy world.  The old friend, the first recruiter who appears to be the only normal one in the bunch, has a cameo before starring toward the end.  And the ending - very, very satisfying.  In fact, the book, despite its moral bleakness was a kind of morality tale played out on a damp, gray stage. A good read.	2005-01-18

I worked on the Lincoln cents series, memorizing the valuable dates and prices before finally completing the entire set. Since that time I have returned to coins again and again, drawn by their allure on many levels. They serve as cultural icons - an encapsulated national history lesson. They are also beautiful works of art...one cannot help but be reminded of the great sculptor Augustus Saint-Gauden who designed, according to President Teddy Roosevelt, the \\"most beautiful coin ever minted\\" - the famous and breathtaking St. Gauden's $20 gold coin. Last, but certainly not least, coins serve as an anchor in bad economic times and as excellent (the best) investments. Even in this age of technology, savvy investors know that gold and silver are \\"for the ages\\". <br /> <br />Throughout it all the Redbook has been a faithful companion. It succeeds where others do not for several reasons - each edition builds on prior works, research is ongoing, latest findings are presetn but most important, it remains THE repository for fair pricing.  I note that it still contains the reminder,  \\"Well-struck, uncirculated pieces demand higher prices than shown\\".  Some things never change. <br /> <br />The listings are accompanied by numerous photographs including a multitude of \\"close-ups\\".  The warnings are also present - Be aware of washed coins or altered dates or forgeries.  But it is the grading system that forms the core of the book.  Despite the non-stop battles over grading methodolgy (I prefer the 70 point system since it seems the most objective) many experts still refer to the Redbook and its language concerning feathers, stars, \\"LIBERTY\\" and hair details.  As long as there are silver and gold coins there will be a Redbook.	2005-01-14

One could almost call this a \\"blessed\\" task considering the fact that not only is he rescuing an almost lost genius from the Netherworld but is bestowing on the world music of almost unparalled beauty.   <br /> <br />Rheinberger was one of the \\"old school\\" - ultra-Romantic, deeply Catholic prodigy who excelled in teaching, composing and performing. Sonata # 10 is Rheinberger coming into his master years, the writing seemingly effortless, sonorities building, melodies weaving and emerging.  He never forgot the fugue and uses it in opening both the 10th and 11th Sonata.  A gorgeous middle section gives way to a powerful ending that turns major. <br /> <br />Five short trios divide these two large works. <br /> <br />It seems as if the 10th were only a prelude to the mighty 11th with its famous opening.  The entire work maintains a unity of unrelenting power in the minor key.  Indeed the only word to describe the final movement (Fugue: Con Moto) is majestic. Pity the world when music like this has disappeared from the landscape.	2005-01-12
399158:US	52706646	R2B9AKDK9P21U9	0838636888	105197542	The Decline of Eastern Christianity Under Islam: From Jihad to Dhimmitude : Seventh-Twentieth Century	Books	5	77	83	N	N	Those who fail to learn the lessons fo the past...	For all who enjoy the writing of Bat Ye'or, I will say that \\"The Decline of Eastern Christianity\\" is only a prelude to his new book (I've read a galley copy), \\"Eurabia\\", an examination of the  European-Arabic anti-American/Jewish alliance. If \\"The Decline\\" presents a horrifying picture of the past, \\"Eurabia\\" projects a similar future for any non-Muslims unlucky enought to live within a Muslim society.   <br /> <br />If I hear another politician say, \\"Muslims are just like Methodists\\" (Bush) I am going berserk. Islam is NOT like any other modern religion in numerous respects.  Nor, as the author points out, has it changed its fundamental beliefs and world view in the past 1300 years. It has, from its inception, spread through quite worldly methods - conquest, forced conversion and mass murder.  Dhimmitude, that secondary status of all \\"infidels\\" within an Islamic society, has been and remains an integral part of the society.  Byzantium was once a thriving culture, the original home of Christianity, the pathway between East and West.  Yet, over hundreds of years those Christian areas - Turkey, Syria, Southern  Europe, Southern Russia - became Muslim through sheer force. One should remember that this was state/church policy, not the decision of isolated kingpins.  Muslims believe that subjugation, slavery and unequal treatment are not only allowable but moral if it furthers the faith.  Thus, the question is viewed differently from the start.  <br /> <br />The writing is detailed, documented, researched.  For the most part, the evidence comes from Muslim sources. If Islam has not exactly been open about its society (and it is strangely authoritarian in so many ways) it has not exactly covered up its past.  No, it has celebrated the lack of diversity found in almost every Muslim country.  <br />  <br />Lastly, the idea of Islamic tolerance.  History has shown that  the idea of \\"moderate\\" Islam is a chimera. The only way a Muslim state achieves tolerance is by ignoring Islam's teachings.  Iran under the shah was a prime example:  Religious pluralism was practiced, veils were not worn, alcohol was served, night clubs were frequent, art was popular. When religious zealots took control, the country descended into the abyss of ninth century madness.  This book serves as a brilliant counterpoint to the argument that all cultures are morally equivalent - they aren't and never will be.  It also serves as warning to the West.	2005-01-06

I sympathize with reviewers who castigate the author for skimming historical events, but he plainly states that the purpose of this book was an explortaion of the early 19th century mindset and what makes it so \\"American\\" and even compelling to this day.    <br /> <br />As a Tennessean, where AJ takes on demigod status, I judged the author to be harsh but in the end, just.  The question persists - were his \\"passions\\" atypical of the times? One must remember that Jackson's life encompassed the most important years of the nation.  A Revolutionary War incident forever soured his view of Britain. He witnessed the founding of the Republic, the settling of the West, the coming of age of the body politic. He may be a grand - even great - figure but his flaws are legendary and it is these upon which Burstein dwelled.   <br /> <br />Whether it was slavery, duels, treatment of Indians, inability to compromise, hot temper or pattern of blaming others for his own mistakes, AJ fares poorly.  What is missing is that inner self so brilliantly illuninated in recent books on Franklin, Hamilton and Adams.  What caused his monomania over the US Bank, why could he never accept criticism, keep friends?  In a sense, he was a \\"modern\\" politician - opponents were not simply mistaken but instead were morally corrupt.  <br /> <br />It is the politics that is missing. I mean, he was President for two terms through sheer force of will.  A diehard Jeffersonian, a believer in an agrarian American, a populist, a foe of \\"special interests\\", a defender of states rights.  His ideas changed once in office and that in itself would have made for good reading. All in all, a good overview.	2005-01-02

Here we are, yet another in this seemingly interminable conflict, wor(l)ds without end, Amen. The Turtledove ouevre is flawed, principally by pitiful characters. They are one-dimensional, symbolic instead of real, utterly predictable.   Featherstone, the Southern leader (a Hitler-like creation) plots nefarious deeds and sounds half-mad in his harangues about enemies.  He is, though, a prototypical Southerner as viewed through through Turtledove's cloudly lens. The dialect is so awful it's good - think Sharon Stone playing Aunt Jemima or Anthony Hopkins as Colonel Sanders. ALL Southerners sound the same- right off the plantation.  Depth of character is, how to say this kindly, not a Turtledove strong point.  <br /> <br />The author is, at heart, a moralistic. His views on politics, history, literature and society may be flawed but he holds forth in black and white terms. We have caricatures, not characters, each representing some quality - heroism (Roosevelt), evil (Featherstone), curmudgeonly (Stalin), prophetic (Churchill), fighter for justice (John Brown, Mao)...It's the same with minor characters.  Hosea Blackford and Flora Hamburger (there are no \\"Bob Smiths\\" around) are right out of a Harlequin romance. Complexity of character is not something associated with this series. <br /> <br />Character is only the tip of iceburg. Eventually, one must face this gawdawful story that crawls with the speed of molasses and tortures the reader with endless repetition (some from previous books).  Does the author think we can't remember from one moment to the next? Back to character - a common complaint - there are just too many, especially as none are memorable.  The cameos by \\"real\\" people (Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler) are staged, as phony as a Hollywood marriage. <br /> <br />Finally there is a total lack of logic.  How many times does the North have to be attacked before it wakes up? Despite its blue  state advantages (educated, liberal, scientific) it seems to breed military and political idiots stymied by the most mundane events and obvious military thrusts.  This is such a failure in nerve, imagination, reason and prose that I would not wish it on my worst enemy.	2004-12-30

When literature and music are culturally interpreted, ethics are situational, when one speaks of slavery as freedom or humanity as inhumanity, we are lost in a sea of intellectual flotsam.  The personal connections to fascism - Heidegger, Paul de Man, Blanchot, Bataille - can be overlooked. The intellectual similarities can't: The supremacy of  will (Nietzsche) over reason and logic (\\"homogenising\\"), an obsession with emotion and political discourse, the celebration of the group over the individual (identity politics) and the idea that truth is what the critic, dictator or prophet says it is. Deconstructionism is, needless to say, popular among folks favoring modern \\"intellectual\\" movements with fuzzy tenets.  <br /> <br />Here, he speaks to us eliptically (of course) as he partakes in the familiar one step forward - two steps backward approach. But if one follows Deconstructionism, why can't HIS writings be interpreted as an S&M fantasy or a desire to be a Greek Orthodox priest in drag?  How do we know what he really means since he suggests that we often write exactly opposite of what we mean?.  He writes of God, death, solitude, life and sacrifice BUT in a new voice of existentialism and doubt.  He employs vague, self-defined and self-referential terms which  effectively shield him from serious study.  <br /> <br />Derrida, for all his rampant explicating, gets hot under the collar when his own words undergo the deconstruction challenge.  Few have questioned his writings since (1) many are impossible to understand and (2) they may or may not mean what they say. What began as a new approach to literature has evolved into the language of intellectual totalitarianism. No one denies his extensive knowledge of Western literature; what galls are the bewieldering interpretations and his ironic attempt at building a new ethos based on syllogism.  As another reviewer stated, take it slow, read several times, search for meaning even when there is none.	2004-12-28

Then who could have predicted that, like the Phoenix rising from the ashes, the very people marked for destruction would in the end, emerge triumphant? <br /> <br />I salute the writer for his effort even if he did get in trouble with the authorities.  It is both informative and entertaining, especially the inside details of the spy world.  (\\"The Boats of Cherbourg\\", a tale of a Mossad vessel-snatching from France after she turned pro-Arab, is another such tale.)  What is horrifying about Eichmann is his everyday normalcy, his seemingly pleasant demeanor, a gentleman who casually chats about murdering millions of people. He is so ordinary as to invite fear.  He even mentions he had Jewish friends before the war but what could he do? After all, the Jews controlled everything.  That eerily sounds like some places in Europe in 2004 <br /> <br />The trial, the political machinantions in Israel (they revived the death penalty for this one case), the evidence - superbly told.  One detects an amateur writer, not a professional, but in a sense that makes the story much more genuine.	2004-12-23

Derrida, like Marcuse, Chomsky, Foucault and others, has moved from his original study to a broader agenda and, like many intellectuals, considers his mastery of one subject transferrable to another.  He managed to survive the embarrassing Paul de Man fiasco and has since wisely avoided mention of the \\"Hitler in all of us\\".  He has remarked on the authoritarian anti-democratic nature of deconstructionism, treating the subject ironically.  <br /> <br />This is, allegedly, a textbook of post-Modern thought on language but reads like a didactic, out-of-focus Proust. The writing is  nebulous, self-referential, unreadable. He speaks in Orwellian terms equating opposite qualities and words. It is so ephemeral as to lack certitude and for this very reason many commentators fear definitive statements on the subject. Deconstructionism is, despite all the twaddle, inherently subjective. He muses on expression, anxiety, emotions, signs and existentialism, finding meaning and interpretation where there is none. His popularity rests entirely on academia and like-minded camp followers in the media. I mean, how many Iowans care about the \\"ultimate\\" meaning of allusions? The problem with the ouevre is that  when taken seriously, it literally make mountains of molehills. <br /> <br />Such as, well, equating fairy tales to S&M sagas, symphonies to invitations to rape, skyscrapers to phallic power trips, signs of \\"white\\" recycled paper as racism and stuttering as aggression. Allusions are, in Derrida-speak, fraught with deep meaning. To accomplish this one must divorce words from their sources and stated intent. The critic has been necessarily elevated above the  author since only he can provide a \\"true\\"  meaning. It is so outrageous that few outside of the Ivory Towers give it credence. That would be a mistake. Language is perhaps the most human of all abilities and its interpretation affects our personal and collective consciousness. His method has been called the \\"language of cultural Marxism\\" and is a necessary component of modern leftist ideology.  At any time I expect Jacques Derrida to announce, like Alan Sokal, that it has all been a collosal joke on both the true believer and the reader.	2004-12-23

If you are a fan of Howard Zinn and his off-the-wall take on history, you most likely view John Kerry as \\"too conservative\\".  Zinn, unlike other \\"historians\\", has always been honest in presenting himself as an ideologue who uses the wrappings of history for spreading his political ideas. <br /> <br />Unlike Paul Johnson, Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, Daniel Boorstin, Ambrose or Foote, his primary goal has never been understanding or explaining history but creating one that meshes with his ideology.  Thus, every event - from Columbus to the Civil War to  WWI, WWII to the Cold War is viewed through a prism of rabid anti-capitalism and identity politics. Although Mr. Zinn never refuses the big bucks he has, like many others of his ilk, been absolutely insistent that our problem begins with our economic system. He is one of the new breed of protestors, a sort of American anti-American. In this sense he differs from past protesters (women, blacks, etc) who viewed America (but not some Americans) in a positive, even laudatory, light and that justice would eventually prevail.  <br /> <br />But it is the writing that comes in for criticism.  What words can best describe this new Qu'ran of Academia (my son's history professor \\"mandated\\" this book). There is no poetry or beauty - just dull, didactic sentences with all the finnesse of a sledge hammer.  Then, it is repetitive to such a degree that one can almost predict the next \\"event\\" and his take on it.  But he fails the basic test of any historian - an inability to differentiate between important and unimportant events. Thus, his obscure \\"rebellions\\" puzzle many readers even as they enforce his idea of an activist populace still \\"waiting for the Revolution.\\"  <br /> <br />Sadly, the rampant preaching (these authors remind one of Southern evangelists) ruined what could have been a good idea.  There are many American myths - the religiosity of the Founders, Washington's cherry tree, unity of the colonies, Lincoln's unpolitical nature, Wilson's belief in equality, etc that could have been explored.  But that would have meant toning down the ideology and that was Mr. Zinn's primary purpose.	2004-12-22
418984:US	52706646	RT3HURQKLI8QS	0525948139	537228107	The President of Good and Evil: The Ethics of George W. Bush	Books	2	24	112	N	N	Consider the Source	Any book by Peter Singer should contain a warning label. The author of the phrase \\"Specism\\" (prejudice against animals) also advocates killing those who cannot comprehend that they are \\"entities with a future\\".  Healthy newborns fall into this category (up to a month after birth). He sees no real taboo in animal-human sex and fanatically promotes his theory of the greater good whereby individuals are submlimated to society \\"as a whole.\\"  It's the gawdawful contradictions that stand out: Buying a leather couch, eating a hot dog or going to the circus is tantamount to murder; killing a healthy baby 28 days after birth is perfectly acceptable.  With those views in mind, Mr. Singer wrote a book about George Bush and his ethics.  <br /> <br />Politically, Mr. Singer is (of course) a Leftist of the Marcusian mode. He has spoken glowingly of the need for an authoritarian  regime of intellectuals who will teach the masses correct thoughts.  There is also a strain of Primitivism, the notion that we should emulate the ancient folks who allegedly lived in harmony with Earth and its creatures.  They also slept on the ground and died at age 30 but why get picky? Needless to say he finds Bush disturbing as much for his morals as his politics. He can't stand the black and white world Bush inhabits; real people are nuanced, subtle, skeptical. Much of the book is allegedly an examination of the moral stance of the Prez but is actually lots of psycho-babble with quotes from like-minded academic folks...lots of suppositions, opinions expanded into statements of fact, mumbo-jumbo passing as evidence. <br /> <br />In the end he attacks religion (well, Christianity). As a secularist I find the number of intellectuals who have adopted ideology as a religion disturbing.  All else is secondary to the credo of their belief - exactly like religion. Their fervor puts a rightwing Christian to shame.  <br /> <br />Singer, as usual, has all the subtlety of a jack hammer on high. He is, though, utterly predictable. It is hard to imagine two world views more diametrically opposed than Singer's and Bush. But Singer harms the very movements he touches.  Those really concerned with animal treatment are wrongfully bunched with him and his absurd pronouncements. Those advocating vegetarianism as a healthy lifestyle are linked with his ravings on the subject. As a final joke to the world, this advocate of euthansia for infants and violence toward scientists is a Professor of Ethics - go figure.	2004-12-19

Marcuse attempts the case for a sort of cultural Marxism - a society in which every single facet of human existence is politicized.  I read this work (very short) some time ago and thought that few would take seriously these statements since they seem to contradict our basic beliefs about art, subjectivity and artistic freedom.  Marcuse speaks with the conviction of the ideologue.  His views of aesthetics mirror his views on the nature of mankind.  <br /> <br />One must remember that Marcuse interprets other subjects in the same manner as he does aesthetics. For example, education is important only so far as it is political indoctrination. His views on art mirror those of Deconstructionism, the literary component of cultural Marxism.  Both language and art are to be divorced from their source, interpreted by \\"experts\\" and judged  by the degree to which they affect political thought. And this is the rub - in a Marcusian world, the purpose of art is not beauty or enjoyment but instead is the shaping of a collective, radical   consciousness.   <br /> <br />He calls for \\"standards\\" on judging art but one quickly discerns that those standards are NOT based on skill. style or technique.  In other words, art is not judged on artistic but ideological standards. Artistic judgement has always been (except in dictatorships) a subjective act but then Marcuse has never been shy in advocating an authoritarian society that would \\"force\\" people to be free (shades of Chomsky).  This is an enlightening book considering its enormous influence in academia.	2004-12-19

Dissenting opinions are to be silenced. His idea of societal/cultural Marxism seems slightly nutty and a tad romantic - one of those theories worked out by tenured professors over a second glass of brandy at the local pub. But Marcuse is anything but flippant - he is dead serious. <br /> <br />He is also a contradiction.  At once didactic (he's German)and eccentric, he also (like Freud) played the part of the gifted bourgeoise trapped amid a swill of nonentities. He has never refrained from advocating a dictatorship of the elite who would guide/help/force the stupid masses. For some reason, he thought undisciplined, nomadic students would lead that vanguard. And in a sense they did - by entering politics, academia or the media.  His disciples are classic \\"NPR\\" types - highly educated, white, well-heeled and immersed in political ideology.  <br /> <br />One cannot underestimate his influence.  His theories led to several current movements (quote unquote): Deconstructionism, the Marxist interpretation of language, Political art, identity politics, group (gender/ethnic) over individual rights, the new Primitivism (radical environmentalism/animal rights) and last but not least, violence as an acceptable political response.   <br /> <br />Despite the shrill denunciation of Western culture he chose to remain behind enemy lines, never venturing to Marxist lands for study where critical works of this kind would not be permitted. This is the paradox: Critical writers would not be allowed in a Marcusian society since \\"wrong\\" ideas are not permitted. Like Chomsky or Vidal or even the clownish Michael Moore, he walked among the very peoples he denounced.  The thesis of the book - typically Marxist - is the plight of the worker brought up to date by Marcuse.  We learn of the horrors of capitalism and the hope for a brighter future. But would his society of mind-numbing politicalization make individuals richer in spirit and more fulfilled?  <br /> <br />One aspect of Marcuse I've always admired is his brutal honesty. Unlike other theorists he openly advocates violence when it is necessary to achieve a political goal.  He embraced the students who rioted in the 60's but unlike other letists he was never fooled by the common worker - they would never willingy accept his societal vision. He says (repeatedly) \\"They must be taught\\".  This work is very 1950sh, especially the parts with the outdated Freudian allusions.  It reads like a religious tract that quotes  ancient writings as the best answer for current problems. One must remember that this was written when Marxism was still taken seriously in some quarters.  Its effects remain with us today.	2004-12-19

Flynn, through  several vignettes, tries to explain modern American culture through the prism of \\"intellectuals\\" whose ideas affected our  society. The author makes 3 salient points that bear repeating:  With the decline of religion, intellectuals increasingly turned to ideology for meaning, the core of ideology is political and, most importantly, ideology values ideas over people.  <br /> <br />The first chapter brilliantly summarizes Marcuse and \\"Cultural\\" Marxism wherein every facet of human existence is politicized. His ideas permeated our culture - from \\"diversity\\" wherein the Left was supported and the Right silenced, to identify politics (gay/ethnic/gender group rights) to victimization to anti-Western bias to a redefinition of education. He had particular disdain for old-fashioned liberals like Hubert Humphrey. He was astute, though, in recognizing that the common worker would never accept his ideas and therefore must be \\"forced\\" to be free. <br /> <br />Elements of violence and authoritarianism are present in all these groups; the \\"truth\\" must prevail and violence is necessary  for the greater good. This explains the perplexing notion of \\"liberals\\" praising despots whole first act would be silencing them or of commentators praising Arafat while condemning Israel. Each ideology seeks Utopia - from an (ir)rational Randian world to Strauss's American Empire to a primitive garden of Eden where humans live in peace with nature and its creatures and have sex without consequences or emotion.  <br /> <br />The article on Chomsky and his continual excuses/espousing of various events (to this day he denies the Kymer Rouge killed millions of Cambodians) was another tour de force. He emphasizes that the mjority of those in non-academic studies (identity politics) drift into three major areas:  Academia, politics and the media.	2004-12-18

She has written an important book about the role of the unreligious in the history of our nation from pre-Revolutionary to current times. It is both documentary and polemicm frequently preachy and engaging in many of the practices denounced in the book - invalid analogies,  exaggeration, mixing (non)religion and politics and  group or character assassination.  <br /> <br />More importantly, she cannot explain why  secularists (and I am one) are still a tiny minority despite their clearly superior rational \\"beliefs\\". Bertrand Russell opined, \\"A God can only be replaced by another God\\"  and, as Jacoby points out, secularism by its very nature is not orthodox and does not have a single creed unlike Baptists, Mormons or Catholics. She reviews the history of \\"In God We Trust\\", the inclusion of \\"under God\\" in the Pledge of Allegiance and the many attempts to insert religious references in our Constitution.  The real heart of the story is the personalities - from Thomas Paine and the Founding Fathers to Robert Ingersoll (a personal hero), Darrow, Susan B Anthony and the (in)famous Madalyn Murray O'Hair. In her description of \\"activist\\" issues, she overstates the influence of secularists.  The Civil Rights, Slavery, Prohibition and Animal Rights movements had small numbers of secularists but the overwhelmingly support was religious-based, not surprising when one compares the number of believers and non-believers. <br /> <br />She purposefully linked secularism with leftist politics, an approach I find distasteful in that it seems to lead to  support/admiration for regimes in which individual rights are not paramount - Cuba, \\"Palestine\\", Vietnam and any number of African states run by good squads.  She is scornful of \\"anti-communists\\" with its ties to religion. She does note that in no other country could one protest for one's rights as is done here and, we are reminded, we can thank our secular Constitution for thatprivelge. <br /> <br />The role of Jews and Judaism in secularism was enlightening. The chapter on Evolution was the best, the last one on those pesky \\"right-wing Christians\\" (a phrase repeated more often than an NPR broadcast) is the worst due to its seemingly pointless invective. She concludes with an appeal:  Sse \\"Freethinkers\\" as the all-encompassing word for atheist or skeptic.  Unfortunately, UK scientist Richard Dawkins has already suggetst the absurd term, \\"Bright\\". Neither is going to catch on any time soon.	2004-12-05

Roth allegedly wrote this book in reponse to the rising tide of  anti-Semitism from college campuses and among the Left in Europe.  Lindburg becomes president in 1940 on a \\"no-war\\" platform.  The politics are rather shaky - he carries 46 states including the South which had been solidly Democrat for 100 years.  But we can give literary license. <br /> <br />After the win he concludes an agreement with both Germany & Japan allowing them free rein in return for a pledge of neutrality.  All aid is cut to England and Russia which brings up another point - how do these nations survive when in reality, US aid was what kept them going?  But our focus in on American and in particular, the Roth family of New Jersey. This book is an odd pairing - semi-autobiographical stories with an overlay of historical fiction. <br /> <br />The Roth house, like American, is torn: Dad's a hyper-Democrat,  brother admires the new President.  Much of the story is simply the tales and travails of the family as anti-Semitism comes \\"out of the closet\\".  Although I like the bopk it doesn't ring true except in the family parts. Jews were banned from country clubs but that's a long way to concentration camps. For such atrocities to occur, a populace must be indoctrinated over a period of time. The Nazi goal of a Jew-free Germany evolved - from social, educational, labor exclusion to urging emmigration (a shameful blot on our own history), conversion to Christianity, etc before deciding on a \\"final\\" solution.  <br /> <br />In a rather confusing ending, Walter Winchell runs for Prez, Lindburg disappears (plane crash or kidnapping?) and a confused tale emerges of Nazi participation in the kidnapping of the Lindburgh baby, rasing it in Germany and then threatening the new President unless he agrees to the demands. Then again, that may all be hype from the former first lady and her \\"Rasputin\\" - a Jewish rabbi (who the family happnes to know) who threw in his lot with Lindburg. Roosevelt returns, the good guys win WWII and all returns to \\"normal\\". But how can it when the nation has undergone such trauma?  As in all of his books there is a missing element that is hard to define.  The personal - family, one on one, confessional - aspects of the story are vintage Roth.  It's the historical fiction that makes the book seem incomplete.	2004-11-28

This is a good biography that gives as much (if not more) attention to the literary words as it does the strictly biographical aspects.   <br /> <br />Fisher is famous for his Western novels, in particular his rather sympathetic book on the Mormons.  He remained an atheist to the end and was convinced after a lifetime of study and reflection that modern society is a consequences of our evolutionary psychology and that forces we consider paramount - love, sex, death, religion, family - have their roots in our pre-human past.   <br />Thus the rise of certain taboos, myths and belief systems. <br /> <br />His epic series, THE TESTAMENT OF MAN, followed our evolutionary climb from cave man to modern creature.

The American Revolution was totally unique in that it was guided by ideas and ideals.  There were no hated Jews or bourgeois or Hutus or \\"infidels\\".  It was an event inspired by unique individuals, one of whom this book is about.   <br /> <br />I agree with other reviewers that the last few years are rushed.  (Perhaps a two-volume series would have been preferable.)  But, if this is supposed to be about the man, his origins, his ideas and his actions - it succeeds brilliantly.   <br /> <br />ALexander Hamilton, the self-made man of illigetimate origins, made so many monumental contributions that simply stating them is breathtaking. He was a brave fighter, he created the current financial system of debt, credit, sound money and banking, he was an abolitionist who fought slavery his entire life, his moderate views on treatment of prisoners was advanced. His legal writings were mandatory reading for New York law students; His authorship of the Federalist Papers secured his place in history as did his organization of the finances of the country. <br /> <br />He practically instituted the idea of judicial review, his memo to Washington on the decorum of the Presidency remains relevant today. The book is detailed (vast research) with quotes from letters of the times. Hamilton excelled at both theoretical and practical subject.  He was a master of organization, a speaker so powerful that opponents prevented him from presentin in person his plans for handling debt and organizing Treasury.   <br /> <br />His marriage proved unhappy and he had affairs, yet his wife remained loyal for 50 years after his death.  A great read, the only drawback being the abbreviated later years.	2004-11-28

What I got, instead, was a fascinating look at Saudi society by a semi-Muslim outsider.  The fact that Carmen was Swiss/Iranian gave her a unique outlook on the situation. She was both sympathetic and repelled by the abysmal state of affairs in the \\"Kingdom\\" of Saud.   <br /> <br />And what a kingdom it is with royal men having 50, 60 even 100 children by numerous wives, with women covered from head to foot, with \\"marriage ceremonies\\" in which a man is substitued for a bride.  The place reads like an insane asylum.  Just one example - when she demanded to go to the store, it was first emptied of all men so that they would not \\"see\\" another woman.   <br /> <br />Her marriage, its failure and in particular, her daughters, are the core of the book.  More and more she felt she could not subject her daughters to this non-treatment.  And the hypocrisy was everywhere - when they met other Saudi couples in Europe, they dined and talked like \\"normal\\" people, yet once they were on  holy ground the craziness began again.   <br /> <br />Her insights into the ultra-orthodox brand of Wahabi Islam, peculiar to Saudi Arabia and now being exported abroad, was especially informative.  By the way, all practicing Muslims are fundamentalists in that they accept the Quran without question.  The events of 9-11 affected Saudi society deeply - it seemed to descend into even further primitivism with women - their existence ignored - devoting their lives to religious ideas in such a way as has not existed since the convents of Medieval Europe.  Hatred of the Jews, the West, foreigners, infidels (other religions) - even shunning those who offer to help - are part for the course.  In the end, Carment and her daughters find freedom.  As she says, Saudi Arabia is simply the Taliban with money.	2004-11-28

Carson Ryder, young detective, and his partner, Harry Nautilus, battle the elements, old and new secrets, walls of silence and internal bureaucracy as they attempt to solve this case.  The bad guy was authentically crazy and the good guys had their faults. <br /> <br />A subplot involves Ryder's deranged brother who gives him insight into how madmen think.  Of course, there is a price for such information...I loved Ava and the way they became a couple.  I'd like to see a sequeal to this if at all possible.   Great read!	2004-11-09

(Our Russian friends gladly accepted our serving like it was gold.)  <br /> <br />This is a great, little story about caviar and the history of this delicacy and the great fish that supplies it.  The sturgeon, of which there are several varieties, is an ancient animal, predating the dinosaurs.  It has remained essentially unchanged because there  was no reason for evolutionary modifications.  It can grow to incredible sizes and the eggs sacs are astounding.   <br /> <br />In Russia, though, the sturgeon nears extinction as the race to capture as much caviar as possible continues. In that country, it is an art - the capture, gutting, creating, selling of this product. THe author gives us first-hand experiences as we fish with the natives, suffer their increasingly declining catches and commiserate in their gloom.  Then there are history lessons on both biological and cultural paths. The ending is not upbeat..  For the fish to regenerate we must rethink our ideas about what constitutes a delicacy.  One problem is the low price of caviar - so low it no longer constitutes a \\"delicacy\\". A good and timely book.	2004-10-25

So, did the blurb writer even read the thing? <br /> <br />The idea was original: Aides and perhaps Congressmen are engaged in a game of betting on certain political events.  It starts simply, from vote counts to inserting language to making laws, and each \\"bet\\" is procured with taxi receipts in which a zero is added to each bet ($100 = $1000), the Zero Game. My quarrel is with the execution. Two buddies are Congressional aides.  Typical liberals, they talk about the  environment, housing, public projects and spend tax money like it's monopoly dough. But for all their idealism they engage in this \\"game\\" and are cynical of ALL politicians who are (surprise)venal, after power, willing to trade votes for sex, controlled by lobbyists, etc.  Why in the world they continue in the face of all this is beyond me. <br /> <br />One friend is soon murdered, contradicting the blurb that clearly states he's part of the chase, and a 17 year old page, Viv, is tapped for help.  She is tall, black and depicted just as you would  expect:  Sassy, religious, full of spirit, in awe of mama, etc. Yet despite the stereotyping, she steals the show, emerging as the strongest and most realized character.  Harris (surviving friend) learns that Matthew was murdered, then someone tries to murder him and the chase is on.  Great action, racing through DC, the Smithsonian, Congress, up to S Dakota to an abandoned mine where a secret lab is located.   <br /> <br />A blind lobbyist, a friend of the two, shows his true colors; the evil hit man is given a sympathetic hearing. I loved the \\"secret\\" but it fails on three levels:  Scientific, psychological and literary. Why would the Arabs develop plutonium in the US when they could do so elsewhere?  And this is yet another James Bond-like scheme in which no one talks and the US government has no clue.  Yet, despite the criticisms, I liked the book. I only wish the author would have used his talents to create more authentic and less predictable characters.  Maybe he can have Matthew brought back from the dead and team with Viv. <br /> <br />	2004-10-25

Some complain that the food is predictably regionalized.  Well, does one get hush puppies in Boston or Oysters in Nebraska?  Of course it is sectional because that best describes our nation and its food character.  The sad thing is that places like those described in the book are  - or should be  - placed on the Endangered Species List.  On a road trip our west I said if I came to one more juncture with the same four or five places I was going to scream. <br /> <br />Needless to say the food in this book is not for those following the Atkins, Jennie Craig, or any kind of diet.  It is filling, wholesome, fat food that tastes as good as it sounds.  The real tragedy is that this book will entertain more by the reading than the actual eating.  And, as another reviewer mentioned, this is not just a book on food - it is also a book about our great nation, its richness and diversity.	2004-10-20

Maybe that's why it was either widely acclaimed or panned to the skies.  For some time, humans have been working on an anti-alien (mutagen) drug that prevents them from converting to something not human.   <br /> <br />Thantos, that hell of a place, explodes and Nick manages to rescue several people including Nick (downgraded from hero to simple pirate with illusions of grandeur), Morn, Davies, her son who was aged rapidy by the evil aliens, the sadist Angus, etc.  We have lovers, family, enemies -the whole gambit, from good and bad and they are all on the same small vessel.  One undercurrent is the struggle against the evil mining company that has control of their brain. <br />	2004-10-20

In this case, the science fiction is only a backdrop to the \\"real\\" book, a study in characters.  A dark and dreary mood permeates this story (and the following ones).  Sure, you don't want a steady diet but for a change of pace...  <br /> <br />I loved Morn and in a perverse way, came to feel something for Angus.  Their relationship was more than master-slave, involving a deeply disturbing complexity.  Actually, I had no trouble getting through the book although I admit that the following works were better.	2004-10-20

It's like viewing a good movie several times.  In this case there is even more wild intrigue and fast-paced action.  Morn survives (of course), the battles on the ship (between the travelers) are great, frenetic activity.  In the end, there was no big mystery, nothing really happened in a spectacular way.  The series did not exactly end with a whimper but instead, a long low sigh from the depths of space.	2004-10-20

The mood is (again) dark and rancide - isn't there some kind of fun in the futures?  Humans are still engaging the aliens but everyone seems to be running around doing their thing. <br /> <br />Angus, the likeable sadist from prior novels, gets his comeuppance. His mind is controlled by a company computer and in particular, by a loathsome representative of that company who has Angus do all sorts of sickening stuff. (This is not for the faint-hearted but remember - it is fiction.)  At the end, the secret word is said and Angus is freed to start down yet another fateful path.  <br /> <br />My biggest complaint - a common one with Donaldson readers - is that you can't see the forest for the trees. There are too many melodies all at once, the actions overlapping and intertwining, going off in several directinos. A coherent, straight-arrow story was never realized and yet it still remained a great, though not remarkable, work.	2004-10-20

Humans are threatened by some of the creepiest aliens ever conceived.  They are not after mass genocide or the destruction of Earth. No, they want a chilling \\"partnership\\" that also happens to include the loss of our humanity.  <br /> <br />This is another space opera where the swashbuckling hero (Nick) meets the damsel in distress (Morn).  But Morn has evolved into a strong-willed character on her own. I loved the interplay between the two and then there's evil but intriguing Angus involved in playing both ends against the middle.  The mood again is dark, almost industrial, like Guidi Prime, the machine world of the Harkonen's in DUNE.	2004-10-20

Let's be honest: If you are a \\"Cultural Creative\\" (what an ego!) you are most likely left-leaing politically, theologically and economically. The so-called wide swath of participants is actually a narrow ribbon. <br /> <br />The most disillusioning aspect about the whole work was the utter predictability of the whole thing. Take any subject (taxes, home schooling, abortion), listen to NPR, and immediately you know a \\"Cultural Creative's\\" stand. Not only their stand but their expressed purpose to guide the rest of us dumb yokels to their viewpoint by hook or crook.  You see, ignorance (wrong choices) is just not allowable.  A strong undertone of authoritarianism runs throughout as if he finds it unbelievable that anyone could disagree with his premises much less his conclusions.  <br /> <br />Who in their right mind does NOT want a kinder, more educated, more humane, do I daresay wealthier society? We are worshipping at the altar of innocent primitivism here.  Incans may have been happier without overtime, cars, TV or fast food but I prefer medicines, dentists, cell phones, air conditioning and plentiful food. At this point we glimpse the elitism and paternalism.  Like sinners of old, we must be cleansed of our bad thoughts and repent (an evangelistic tone runs is rampant). We either adopt their viewpoint and \\"save the planet\\" or (I guess) allow Earth to self-destruct. The simple truth is: Americans are not ideologues much less misguided utopians.  We are practical folk, weaned on experience and tradition, working with what we are given and can make. Our concerns are not for some nebulous future but for ourselves and our families.  And with those goals in mind we each attempt to better ourselves, our children and the world about us.	2004-10-16

Yet how many times have you lost that finesse, or guessed wrong and got trumped or lost a game because trumps split 4-1 vs 3-2?  This book lets you catch things like this and nip them in the bud.  Very good read with lots of illustrations and examples.	2004-10-16

But one must remember that he is both and his latest book demonstrated both the instructional and practical sides. It is (as usual) clear, concise and ro the point.  I like Kantar's prose, his ease of explanation and the way he sets just the right tone.  Of course, he discusses the bid, the opponent and, most important, keeping track of the play while counting the cards (the one thing that separates the professional from the amateur).

The operative word is personal. It is difficult to fully interpret biographical events as part of the epoch-changing phenomenon he calls \\"Modern\\".   <br /> <br />\\"Modern\\", which began in the 19th century, affected not only the physical world but how we viewed that world. The author opines as to how an object or idea is either pre, post or actually modern.   The range - from architecture to art to war to electricity and inventions - cover the gambit.  <br /> <br />Lienhard believes \\"Modern\\" denotes a societal mindset, one we no longer possess. He is absolutely correct. Our society is awash in waves of data that can be neither integrated nor understood.  Our spirit (for lack of a better word) is unlike the Modern pioneers.  We've lost our innocence, our belief that technology will better our lives. Nor do we seek knowledge for its own sake. This is illustrated by popular myths: The environment is degrading, the economy is collapsing, chemicals are lethal, life is drugery, etc. The facts are, the UN again rated the US #1 for clean water and safe food, we are richer than ever, we have unprecedented free time and access to virtually any entertainment, news or information at our fingertips.  In this post-modern age, the cry is for something different. <br /> <br />The author IS correct that \\"Modern\\" stopped in the 1950's.  We define \\"modern architecture\\" as Frank Lloyd Wright, \\"modern art\\" as Andy Warhol and Mark Rothko, \\"modern cars\\" as snazzy Vets.  Yet biotechnology, space travel and new inventions may usher in a new age he calls \\"Expanded\\".  Recommended for serious readers.	2004-10-16

Take the idea that the Gospels were written by different communities for their particular needs.  I heard this maybe, oh, 25 years ago and it was popular in the First Critical Movement in Germany.    <br /> <br />Same for the relationship between Mark, Luke and Matthew and yes, there is that pesky \\"Q\\" (reminds me of the character of the same name on Startrek who kept popping up in odd places\\").  As another reviewer emphasized, the author thinks Luke copied the (in)famous \\"Q\\" verbatim where every other single book was an amalgam of ideas, superimposed thoughts, compromises, etc.  Unlike others, he opines that there was perhaps a historical man called Jesus but that these writings have nothing to do with that man. <br /> <br />We are again looking at Paul, the visionary, and his writings. Is it possible he could have developed an entire theology from the germ of an Old Testament idea?  The writings of Paul are the closest (chronologically) to the alleged time and deserve a more balanced approach.  The prose is arching, pontifical at times, but for a much better holistic view, nothing beats \\"THE UNAUTHORIZED VERSION\\" by the great Robin Lane Fox.	2004-10-12

I'd sworn off the genre some time ago due to its unsettling nature but was convinced by a passerby that this one was more a case of bad parentubg than gruesome child abuse.  I am not so sure now. <br /> <br />We learn a little from every book and in this one it is the world of the Amish, their secrets and way of life.  The villian left the the religious community with his son after the suspicious death of his wife.  He set out on what can only be called an orgy of casual, gay sex and murder.  The authorities are still not sure how many he killed or if he killed his own son (because he knew too much). He was convicted of abandonment then brought up on another murder and convicted. He was suspected in the death of his wife (fire) and son (suffocation or intentional exposure to sub-zero weather) and in 1990 was the chief suspect in the murder of yet yet two more gay men.  He seemed to be destroying anyone who could link him to what he perceived as the unpardonable sin. <br /> <br />Throughout it all he proclaimed his innocence, got amnesia, found God, quoted Scripture while negotiating for movie rights and, incredibly, retained a cadre of folks who felt sorry for him.  Gay groups raised funds, religious folk visited, women were supportive...it defies any kind of rational thought. Great book.	2004-10-10

The research was stupendous but best of all was the ability of the author to create a compelling story from the disparate components.  True, this is no FATAL VISION or HELTER SKELTER but it is a very good read.  My only complaint is one heard often - too much unimportant detail that detracts from the power of the story.

I guarantee that if the author had used \\"CNN\\" vs \\"FOX\\", \\"helping the poor\\" vs \\"17% flat tax\\", Democrat vs GOP and \\"Taiwan\\" instead of \\"Israel\\" there would not be a peep about political bias. Readers are so used to the \\"mainstream\\" (LOL) view of the world that anything not following the set formula is immediately suspect.  For this reason, many  conservative books get undue praise; there is such a lack of diversity in the academic, journalistic and literary world that anything remotely different is seized upon like a drowning man gasping gasping for air. <br /> <br />I had never heard of this book before spotting it in the store but I did recognize the author from the WSJ.  The story was better than the plot, if you get my drift. I can't quite see Iraq as the mastermind of worldwide plotting although the nuclear stalemate is quite conceivable, particularly with Iran. The idea of round-the-world terrorism is a fact.  <br /> <br />Criticism:  Choppy at times, too many minor characters who appeared, spoke and disappeared.  The only one who became \\"real\\" were the hero and the Iraqi spy master. Everyone else - Saddam, Secret Service, President, female lead, terrorists, politicians - were mere fodder for the story.  The action was very \\"Clancyesqe\\" with lots of technical weapons descriptions that most people skip but the \\"behind the scenes\\" action and the idea that a nuclear weapon could be used was great.  At some point in the future, the US and Israel will have to face a nuclear-armed Iran who is more than willing to aid terrorism - that would be the story to write.	2004-10-10

Perhaps it is due to the lack of a trial but the stories are riveting.  Yes, I said stories (not story) because COLD KILL is as much about the aftermath as it was the crime itself. <br /> <br />David West had an affinity for guns, women and fun. Cindy Ray was attracted to money, David and the world of glamour.  She was the victim of incest, in effect, giving birth to her father's son and grandson.  David and Cindy wanted money and the fastest way was through inheritance. The only problem was that her parents were still alive.  One night they were murdered execution style.  <br /> <br />Long story short: Cindy rises in the modeling world and drops David. Cindy started grabbing for all the money as things settled down with the police unsure how to procede. Along comes Kim, a shapely PI who went after David (using her feminine wiles) for a confession.  The last third of the book is compelling reading although I'm not sure how many of the thoughts of the  participants are surmised or reported.  Kim begins to feel something for the guy (oh Lord) despite thinking he murdered two people in cold blood...COLD KILL.    <br /> <br />At last, one night he confesses everything and surprise, Cindy was also involved.  David maintains that it was a moral act, an execution, not murder.  At the end, David avoided execution by confessing and implicating his former lover.  He and Cindy were sentenced to life imprisonment proving, once again, that crime does not pay.	2004-10-10

I knew the outcome, the dialogue was fairly predictable and the action was ho-hum.  Maybe this is Lawrence Sanders mea culpa for his \\"traditional\\" (politically incorrect) excellent police procedurals - Sins, Commandments, etc.  There's lots of violence, a hallmark of 20th century ideology in which we have slowly become accustomed to the use of violence for political purposes whether it be bombing a clinic, church, destroying property, rioting, looting or murdering 3,000 people because they are seen as the enemy. <br /> <br />Molly is a real winner, yes-sir, a one woman force dedicated to helping the \\"weaker\\" sex.  Her methods are suspect, lots of lying and double-crossing, blackmail and sexual liasons when the urge hits. The lead male character was truly \\"out of character\\" - a tough cop who obediently carries out her violent bidding without question. Yet he never evinces for a second a genuine interest in advancing the cause of women, if \\"women\\" can be a \\"cause\\".   <br /> <br />Molly and Associates's aim is redress for all the bad years and numerical equality in all positions regardless of ability, skill or experience. To get this accomplished they kill and threaten people - simple as that. At the end, the new FEMALE Veep nominee presents a set of ludicrous demands (a woman to head the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Federal Reserve, etc) to the next Prez and opines smugly to hubby that perhaps the President won't live out his first term.  What a gal!	2004-10-10

This short piece is well-written with historical commentary and  apt observations. It is also flawed: The blurb states democracy is in trouble because the press is controlled by \\"moneyed interests\\" who do not question the status quo.  But the pages reveal an angry diatribe alternating between beautiful prose and agitprop. <br /> <br />Lapham, a member of the academic/journalist corp, insists that the democratic underpinnings of our society are being undermined.  Yet he whines when decisions not to his liking occur in a democratic fashion either by election or Congressional action. It's a classic Red (heartland) vs Blue (coasts) debate  expressed in numerous forums (the list on pp 141-142 sums the differences).  Throughout, things that one normally associates with popular Americana are derided - use of the flag, reciting the Pledge, love of sports, public religious utterances, journalistic support of the military in time of war, credit cards, profits, suburbs - you get the idea. <br /> <br />The criticism heard and seen daily would astound a WWII populace. An avalance of books critical of the Prez abound; demonstrations are massive and well-financed, political bashing by opponents continues unabated. The NYT, Wash Post, CBS, ANC and CNN - all \\"moneyed\\" interests - relentlessly criticize the Administration. Indeed, most mainstream media overwhelmingly resonate with the litmus-test list (pp 141-142).    <br /> <br />His \\"heroes\\" are united by an anti-war and anti-Israeli fervor - Rep Barbara Lee, Chomsky, Rep Franks, Vidal, ACLU, Michael Moore. The bad guys are predictable: Members of Congress who sing \\"God Bless America\\" after 9/11, Billy Graham, the \\"Religious Right\\", Israel, FOX, \\"big\\" corporations, Republicans...  <br /> <br />The historical allusions were interesting but the attempt to bind them to current problems and Administration was a stretch. At the end one is unsure what the author thinks the US role should be.  Do we withdraw from the world and hope for the best, should liberty be promoted as an antidote to Islamic fascism, should Israel be forced to compromise with the \\"nation\\" of Palestine, should the US respond when attacked, if asked, should we help? <br />Who knows?	2004-10-09

But it is simultaneously both an intellectual mystery and a coming of age saga. The hero, a likeable self-affacing young man, tells the story first person by alternating past and present events.   Academically, the research is far superior to Dan Brown's (the scholarship, ingenuity and sheer bravura were incredible) and approaches Eco.  <br /> <br />The bitter sweet romance was delightful but it was the four roommates, their friendships, interactions and increasingly intertwined lives that guided the story.  For anyone who likes puzzles, literary history and the college life, this is a rare find.  <br /> <br />The fact that the book actually exists and that there is an ongoing debate over authorship and meaning only added to the mystery.

Like other reviewers, I devoured the original series and even liked the three \\"family\\" series.  But something changed in the \\"Legends\\" Series - the story not only got off track but introduced elements that were disconcerting in the least.   <br /> <br />Where to start? The sadism was so bad that when Erasmus or one of the Titans drew near to a human I skipped ahead, unable to stand any more elevated rationalizations from these monsters. Besides, we are never told why they act as they do - what drove them to this madness? Speaking of madness, the cult of Serena was one of the wackiest ever.  The idea of unarmed mobs taking over a governnment was absurd. <br /> <br />Then we had those interminable battle scenes that were the epitomy of dullness. The conversations among the robots were  ridiculous, more like something on Mystery Science Theater. There were too many characters and the hero (Vor Atriedes)remained distant, never acquiring a personality.  Also the characters made decisions totally \\"out of character\\" again and again. The writing style (three pages/chapter) is annoying, making it seem like a series of vignettes instead of a seamless tale.  <br /> <br />On the plus side, we learn the origins of the Spacing Guild  (Norma, my favorite character, appeared briefly). The origins of the Bene Geserit - more an accident than a purposeful event - was a good saga. We learn why the Harkonnens are hated, the Atriedes admired and the Corrinos in command. I hope the authors move on to other things...drop the robots, the battles and get on with the mythology. <br />	2004-09-25

Ambrose has knocked another one out of the park with the story of the famous Lewis & Clarke Expedition that opened the American West to the new country.<br /><br />How many times have we heard that \\"all they did was walk a long way\\" or \\"they did nothing that native Americans had not done before\\" or (worse of all) \\"they didn't accomplish anything.\\"  This is the story not only of just explorers but of Presidents and nations.  Their trip was no Sunday stroll through the woods. It was preceded by lifetimes of experience, years of preparation, organization and planning on a scale rarely  seen before or since and once underway, withstood the hardships of the open country, unfriendly natives and unfamiliar wildlife.<br /><br />We live in an age in which heroes are castigated and belittled for the mere fact of being heroic. I admire not only the physical courage necessary but the intellectual underpinnings of the trip. The results were astounding and changed - perhaps as much as any one event - the way we viewed both our nation and our mission. The story was told chronologically with great detail.  Their trusty translator, the Indian girl, her husband, the soldiers, the Indian chiefs - all became real in this book.  The maps were superb and the individual vigenettes (losing supplies, men lost, arguments, snake bites, etc) gave the story a reality that mere recitation of facts cannot provide.<br /><br />The research required for such a book is astounding (note the incredible bibliography).  And Ambrose has a way of bringing to life dry, historical figures...they become more than characters in a book.  He superbly blends culture, history, politics and science into a seamless whole - a task worthy of five stars.	2004-09-12

I had anticipated a more leisurely discussion of art history, the story of science, etc on the order of Daniel Boorstin or Fernandez-Armesto. Instead, we're presented with a detailed explanation of the methodology used to determine human achievements and achievers. (The mathematical/statistical discussions should have been placed in an appendix but then they would never have been read.)<br /><br />Murray maintains that human achievement is based on excellence and that the best measure of achievement is by studying what experts in those fields say. He takes scholarly works and uses statistical analysis based on preponderence of mention to derive a Top XXX List for several categories in the arts and sciences.  He offers separate lists for non-Western cultures where we would be comparing apples and oranges (literature, art, philosophy).<br /><br />Not only does he attempt to identify what human achievement is he is also concerned with answering the why. He spends an inordinate amount of time on the issue of women and minorities. (The vast majority of those listed are European, male and white.) The story of the Ahskenazi Jews and their over-representation vs women and their under representation is a jewel. He even examines documents from works with the stated goal of emphasizing non-Europeans and finds almost exactly the same correlation of \\"great\\" events and people.<br /><br />Especially intriguing were his twelve meta-inventions, tools or observations (artistic realism, polyphony, logic, the scientific method) that changed \\"everything\\".  There are so many astute observations - artists are expendable and replaceable, scientists are not - the idea of purpose and individuality was a factor - the way individuals saw themselves under Eastern and Western philosophy - the role of war and peace - IQ levels among groups - genetic differences between the sexes - how very limited the area and populations were for achievement.<br /><br />His thoughts on the sheer, sustained intellectual effort required for achievement should be mandatory reading. People instinctively recognize excellence which explains why \\"rap\\", \\"performance art\\" and cartoons are not held in the same esteem as a Bach cantata, an Ibsen play or WAR & PEACE. They do not require the skill, study or hours of practice associated with greatness. He ends on a disquieting note with the observation that human achievement is declining. This is a must read for all interested in our species and its possibilities./>His thoughts on the sheer, sustained intellectual effort required for achievement should be mandatory reading.

I'm sure that will come as a shock to both writers.  Actually, for a debut, it was fantastic.  I love the philosophical mysteries because they unite two seemingly disparate worlds - philosophy and (usually) murder.  Actuallt, the two are closely related since the overwhelming majority of humans murdered have been for philsophical reasons - religion or ideology (fascism, socialism, tribalism). <br /> <br />The plot ensnares the reader from the start:  A graduate student is writing a dissertation on the radical nihilist, Joseph de Maistre. Upon returning home he finds all his papers, every copy, stolen.  Events lead him to an appointment to the Supreme Court where he discovers an entire cabal of writers  and politicians dedicated to the \\"principles\\" of de Maistre.  Possessed with this knowledge he is a marked man.  He must expose the group and the powerful members before he is killed.  Great read.	2004-09-12

Amazon has bestowed an almost embarrassingly fervent critique unlike the Post or the Times, both of which trashed the book. It is important to separate the man, the myth and the book.  Bill Clinton truly is larger than life, an icon to many, devil to others.  The autobiography is a kind of therapy in which the internal demons can be understood if not conquered. <br /> <br />Clinton - both from his public life and this book - is the type of guy you want to take fishing or golfing or drinking, discuss the latest book or hear about the effect of the Galbraith on international economic trends.  His humor is infectous, his anger legendary, his fights with himself constant.  In other words, he is just the opposite of the current president.   <br /> <br />But this applies to not only his virtues but also his vices.  He does a good job of explaining/excusing them, is somewhat self- deprecatory and from the reading, has learned to accept who he is and what he is. But there is a lot missing here.  He chronicles but does not provide an accompanying insight into his thoughts at the time.  It is more like a documentary that a revelation.  <br /> <br />The book is self-serving, but they why shouldn't it be?  The story of the fat boy from Hope is one I told my boys during the Monica scandals - he was proof that ANYONE can become President of the United States.  What's interesting are the behind the scenes machinations of talks, the political decisions, the way he reacts and his innate ability to say the right thing. He only touches on some some of the myths, i.e. that he was the  great politician.  As a matter of record, he never got 50% and under him the GOP gained control of Congress and the majority ofr governors.  The idea of Clinton the sensitive soul is lost here also.  We gain insight into the reasoning behind his decisions but not the emotions that accompanied them.  It's too long and too detailed but it is a great summer read.	2004-09-11

Bush	Books	3	19	52	N	N	Dean Can't Decide what he wants to say	By that, I don't mean that he is unsure about his thoughts on the current administration.  What I do mean is that he can't decide who he wants to be - prophet, court jester, pundit, evangelist or ideologue. Dean has turned Watergate into a cottage  industry, lecturing, writing, commenting on the early 70's, as if he is caught in a time warp. <br /> <br />With his background it is not surprising that his world is one of not-so-secret conspiracies. What IS surprising is that  the Left has taken over this world view from the far Right who used to go on about flouride and black helicopters. Search through all the myraid buzzwords - Big Business, oil, Arabs, religion, old money, new money, Texas, mining, Haliburton, Israel...you are sure to find some kind of connection no matter how nebulous. <br /> <br />Secondly, the book is rife with little \\"gotchas\\" as if he cannot help but make his point with fists rather than words. This is NOT a dispassionate critique of \\"W\\" but more a running commentary mingled with diatribe.  Such writers are at a disadvantage in that the only readers are those who already agree. Dean's REAL problem is a sad but frequent one - He views Bush and his supporters not as merely wrong politically but somehow morally evil, just the sort of thing Jefferson warned us about.   <br /> <br />They (bad guys) do not come to their beliefs as he does - through sifting evidence, reason, doing what is best for the country. No, THEIR choices are made only for venal reasons rooted in murky, dark backroom deals.  From Iraq to drilling for oil to judicial appointments and tax policy, Dean sees evidence of shadowy machination, a sort of Gnostic view of society in which the \\"real\\" truth is always illusory and known only to a few.  I DID finish the book and actually enjoyed a few parts (you can always learn a few things) but as one reader stated, you know what you are going to get before you start.	2004-09-10

This was also a good mystery, the idea of the \\"game\\" was superb, the action intense, the romance and heat between Stephanie, the cop and Ranger still going strong... <br /> <br />I would like to see more along this line.  We are sick of the car problems, the nutty grandma and that &@$& hampster.  Evanovich excels in the introduction of minor characters that somehow become part of the overall story - witness Ranger and Lula not to mention the cross-dresser and Valerie's man.  The plot line was more in line with traditional mysteries and the surprise - that the people were killing each other in a \\"game\\" - was only a prelude to the horrifying chase through the dark factory.

I was expecting something on the order of \\"GOD'S FUNERAL\\". This book was more a call to arms than a scholarly evaluation.  In any case, superstition, religion and faith are not going away anytime soon despite the numerous predictions to that effect. A scientific article recently opined that belief in the supernatural could be hard-wired into our evolutionary psychology.   <br /> <br />I detect three problems in the book (despite my agreement with the tenor of his message): (1) He offers nothing in place of religion.  Nice words and good deeds do not suffice. As Russell said, \\"God can only be replaced with another god.\\"  That may be humanism, Buddhism (one of the nuttiest), scientific determinism, duty to mankind or some other idea but none has the appeal or hold of religion.  <br /> <br />(2) He sees all religions as being morally equivalent and equally dangerous - from once-a-year Methodists to suicidal Islamists. The American religion for over 200 years has been an ecumencalism that benefitted all concerned. We are the most religious and most technologically advanced society on Earth, a paradox. But there is a tempering of a strong dose of realism. As the New Englander said, \\"Trust in Providence but leave nothing to chance.\\"  More believe in astrology than that the world is only 7,000 years old. And even fundamentalists who do think that are not running around chopping off heads of those who disagree.   <br /> <br />(3) He wants to lose ALL superstition. Does that include New Age crap, astrology, chain letters, the idea of luck, the lottery? How far do you go in forcing people to be rational? There are many, Harris included, who yearn for a Startrek World in which religion has disappeared and humanity marches solemly forward to the beat of peaceful coexistencee, scientific progress and the wonder of discovery. While those are all worthy ideas they do not capture the \\"soul\\".Good reading - bad pleading.	2004-09-09

It's better organized than Michael Moore (not saying much), more erudite than most, but you come away thinking that despite her protestations, she is not quite serious - a sort of Sex & the City look at politics. At least she calls herself a columnist and not a \\"journalist\\" or worse, a reporter.  <br /> <br />In rare moments Maureen coins a cute phrase that sticks with you all day but she is consistent if nothing else: Blast Bush & Co, Praise Bill/Hillary or JOHN (Kerry)(Edwards)(McCain).  That last one is on her S-- List at the moment for backing Bush. I've exchanged emails with Ms. Dowd and find her as witty in cyberland as she is in her column, though she did take exception to my suggention that she whips those few paragraphs un the limousine on the way to the Times.   <br /> <br />There's a few attempts at neutrality but it's not serious - more a question of style. And it's always delivered in the tone of a prim reprimand conveying a \\"just between us girls\\" wink and a nod. She reserves her fire for the Bushes - and I do mean the entire clan. No one has figured out who put a bee in her bonnet about George 41 but she has had it out for that family for years.  It's a lucrative obsession. <br /> <br />If you live in the Blue States, this is the book for you. Ms Dowd has never tried to understand the Neanderthals who inhabit that dark area between the coasts.  Her outlook is typically Manhatten...rail at the Administration's actions toward the poor while sipping champagne, downing another blop of caviar and exchanging faux kisses with people you hope never to meet again. Dowd would be a perfect for the society column with her love of celebrity, who's up, who's down, who's in, who's out and while her conspiratorial dronings (read Bush, Mideast, Righ-wing, Christiant fundamentalists, snore, snore) are occasionally amusing they are also redundant.  Read the columns and save a few bucks.	2004-09-09

Books	3	11	15	N	N	The problem is the Prose - not the Tone	I wondered for a long time what all the hubbub was about Michael Moore.  I had seen him on television and he came across as a bumbling, good old boy with a smart mouth - a sort of leftist Joe Schmo.  I decided to see for myself and this book was recommend by an earnest bookstore employee/fan (she wore a Nader button.) <br /> <br />After reading the whole thing I wonder - what was the big deal?  Sure, he rants and raves and exaggerates, takes things out of context, compares apples and oranges, even lies occasionally but this is a political book.  What I could never discern was his inner demon - what compels this man to trash his country and countrymen so savagely time and time again?  Can anyone with an atom of intellectual honesty purport to be \\"one of the people\\" while buying a second multi-million dollar home?   <br /> <br />Moore craves respectability and influence yet his persona reeks unprofessionalism, immaturity and insecurity.  The sad truth is that he is cutting but not witty, harsh but not compelling. His prose is unstructured, organization nil, thoughts jump out, run for a while then he is onto something else. He has the subtlety of a sledge hammer and those who disagree are not politically wrong but morally evil.  His inability to get along with others, regardless of political stripe, is legendary. And despite his bashing of the \\"rich\\", few can match the wealth he has attained on the back of national tragedy.	2004-09-08

In fact, it was interesting but not exactly what I had in mind.  I enjoy books that use Science Fiction as a backdrop for a story about the human condition or romantic relationships, i.e. Fires of God, Hercules Text, Contact.  The trouble is that the hero is never authentic nor are the situations that profound. Someone said it best when they noted the whole thing appears to be a draft of a novel. <br /> <br />As always, I note that even 350 years in the future, people still go on job interviews, have physical computers, and that strangely all the current historical sites (Congress, monuments, White House, etc) are still standing and intact. The reason for the alien attack is finally disclosed but I had LOTS of trouble with the boarding and exploration of the vessel.  I mean, the descriptions were so esoteric and unclear that I could barely follow them on their journey. <br /> <br />I would have preferred two novels - one with alien contact, the other about the personal/political situation. Combining both in the same story only lessened the intensity of each. One sees the idea of a budding Martian-Earth romance between the scientists but for some reason this is side-tracked and we meet the snippy ex-wife.  In fact, there are way too many characters for so short a book.  I have railed against authors who introduced a myriad of folks, assign them a small task and forgettable dialogue before they sink into oblivion.  <br /> <br />The ending was exactly what you guessed half way into the story.  Everyone is healed, peace breaks out, true love conquers all. There is nothing bad with this (I am a romantic, at heart) but when you offer a pat conclusion, the preceding action must be sufficiently invigorating to withstand the mundaneness.  In this case it was not.	2004-09-06

It is also not screaming loudly, \\"THIS BOOK IS THE TRUTH!\\" Miller, despite all the invective, is a life-long Democrat in the Southern tradition. He feels, probably rightly, that there is no room for conservatives in the Democrat Party. <br /> <br />He chronicles the regional and ideological reallignment of the political parties. The coalition of urban liberals and Southern segregationists successfully produced liberal Presidents and Southern-controlled Congresses. Both parties were \\"strong\\" on defense, the issue not even raised in Presidential elections (one of Miller's arguments at the convention).   <br /> <br />Miller hails from a state like mine (TN) in which there were no ideological differences between the parties.  The Democratic Party is disappearing in the South for one reason: The insistence on ideological purity.  Miller says there is no room for those who oppose abortion or gun control or high taxes or a host of other similar issues.  They are not only shut out of the process, they are effectively muzzled.  Ironically, the once-monolithic GOP now accepts variations from the party line and allows other views to be stated.  <br /> <br />Miller's other argument - just as critical - is that the party has degenerated into a mob of conflicting special interests: Racial, unions, academia, lawyers, feminists, gays, etc and that some of the messages emerging appear unseemly if not downright  anti-American. Even in Civil Rights days, marchers thought of America in a positive light.  <br /> <br />This is a diatribe more than a reverie but that is his style. I am reminded of Barry Goldwater who volunteered that in 1964 he voted for a few Democrats.  Can someone imagine Al Gore saying he voted for a few Republicans?  And that is Miller's point.	2004-09-05

The blurb about the book sounded hokey (\\"the fate of the world is in one woman's hands!!\\") but I thought, how bad could it be?  When I finished I saw that the author is a writer of ROMANCE novels...surprise, surprise. <br /> <br />The plot starts off OK. The VP, code-named Lady Liberty by the Secret Service, is attempting to negotiate an end to a conflict and is intentionally cut by a passing waiter. Her knight in shining armor, former bodyguard and devoted fan, steps in with steely purpose.  (****NOTE:  All characters are cartoonish, every emotion and action idealized, culled from any romance novel, i.e. totally unrealistic.) She is called away on a Code I Emergency and her plane blows up in mid-air. Luckily, her hero \\"smells death\\" and they jump out of the plane with one parachute, land in the Everglades and start trekking. Neither, by the way, are hurt in this fall. <br /> <br />The VP is one heck of a lady..she's for ALL the people, not just her party.  She works for kids and the poor and of course the party hates her.  Former hubby, an evil big business type,is in with the terrorists, preposterously presented as non-Islamic. The author's knowledge of business is about on par with her knowledge of politics - none unless you think PEOPLE is an authority. LL is so beloved that even her enemy fights for her life because she \\"cares!\\". Of course, in the midst of a swamp with time running out for a nuclear launch (how original) she and her admiring agent profess their L-U-V, kiss, call each other by their first name, etc.  One hears the violins soar. <br /> <br />It is a romance novel thinly disguised as a political mystery. But the political insights are corny and exactly what one would expect from Hollywood. Lastly, the author has an annoying habit of referring to people by different names. Thus, the President may be President, may be his last name, may be his first name.  By the end of the book there seems to be a million figures running around trying desperately to connect the many threads into something that makes sense. Unfortunately, they fail.	2004-09-05

I did NOT vote for Bush in 2000, assured that he would (as he did) run up huge deficits and not push some clever ideas of the campaign. The only thing I knew of John Kerry before now was that he was a \\"decorated\\" Vietnam veteran and worked diligently to protect corporate donors (AGI, etc) I can look past the marrying for money and the Brahman attitude - he's from Boston, what do you expect?. <br /> <br />The story taken on its face is an indictment and unlike similar books, Kerry's own words provide much of the evidence. We have live witnesses, names, dates, times. There are two issues - his conduct during the four months he was in Vietnam and his conduct after returning.  We all embelish the record but what is not permissable is out and out lying for political purposes.   <br /> <br />The authors are no angels themselves and have made contradictory statements at times...BUT they are not running for President. It is hard to believe he actually testified that GIs routinely cut off ears, burned villages, raped, etc knowing full well it was untrue. It fits a pattern of using his service as a springboard to office and to cover a rather mediocore political career.  <br /> <br />He threw his medals in the fire (several variations) after which he was elected on a \\"I served honorably\\" platform. What galls  veterans is that he called them criminals, never apologized and now asks to be President because he served four months in which he won a slew of medals without getting a scratch. Further, he repudiated his own service in the war when he returned but now runs of that repudiated action.  Unfortunately for Kerry, karma is alive and well and all his past misstatements are coming back to haunt him.	2004-08-26

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	3	24	32	N	N	The "problem" remained elusive	Picking up our city \\"alternative\\" paper (great writing, leftist orientation, ads strictly for the well to do NPR crowd), I saw an article:  \\"Rooting Against America.\\"  (The Olympics were taking place.) The author wonders if he is the only one hoping our country is defeated because of \\"edited, biased, coverage\\" from American networks.  If one wants to know why conservatives have won the heart and soul of American, there is not better place to start. <br /> <br />Regional politics change all the time.  Until recently, the Northeast was conservatism personified.  States like Idaho, Wyoming, Kansas and Nebraska represented \\"progressive\\" politics while the South voted slavishly Democrat before becoming a bastion of Republicanism. About the only places resisting change are the large, urban areas run by Democrat machines. It is not just Kansas, i.e. former progressive areas, that have changed. <br /> <br />This book, like others, claims that if people would just wake up and vote for  a particular party (take your pick) they'd be happier, healthier, wiser and wealthier. The other party is purported to represent only a small minority yet wins around 50% of the vote each time. As you can see, this applies to both parties equally. <br /> <br />Each four years we see the spectacle of GOPers railing about free-spending Democrats after a GOP Congress has run up debts that will never be paid.  At the same time we hear dire warnings from minority leaders that they're being taken for granted, after which Democrats nominate two middle-aged white guys who receive 90% of the minority vote.   <br /> <br />The book is infuriating yet hilarious at parts but misses the point.  The reason conservatives won is that when John Doe is faced with the prospect of choosing between right wing rhetoric and vaguely \\"progressive\\" statements from multi-millionaire politicians telling us they are for the \\"common man\\", they choose the right every time.  It is telling that over 85% of academia and  journalists vote Democrat - an astounding statistic that says volumes about yet another event the author barely mentioned.  <br /> <br />The center of cultural and political power has shifted from the Northeast/Midwest to the South & West. That is a difficult pill for many to swallow, particularly as these areas are most often seen as backward and unenlightened. Despite the protestatations, the rhetoric remains slightly condescending, a tone of \\"we understand your stupidity\\".  After all, this is Kansas.	2004-08-24

They changed the way we thought about nature and in so doing changed the way we thought about ourselves. Nicolaus Copernicus challenged the notion of a heliocentric universe. Galileo Galilei reiterated that with the added evidence of moons of other worlds. He introduced the discipline of physics into the discussion. Johannes Kepler used this new science to measure the orbits of the planets and discover HOW they spun in their orbits (he gave us the three planetary laws).  <br /> <br />Newton used that information to explain the underlying reasons for motion, gravity, acceleration.  He also built on Kepler's work in optics. Albert Einstien used the Newtonian universe as the starting point for introducing us to the relativistic nature of existence.   <br /> <br />This is NOT a book for beginners - it contains some heavy mathematics, theorem, and the writing is at times, turgid. What I found lacking was the \\"commentary\\" by Stephen Hawking.  I, like others, had presumed that it was going to be give and take...he would introduce the scientist, let us see some of their work, then offer commentary. Instead what we got were LONG tomes that, while being the essense of the genius, are hardly digestable as public reading.  It is an impressive work but is not easily accessible by the layman.	2004-08-14

Instead, what we get is a depiction of evil (call it what you like) that, for some reason, comes to control and consume otherwise normal people.   <br /> <br />The various ways in which this evil slowly became resident was a good story in itself.  Particularly impelling was the story of Marianne who is convinced that evil personas inhabit our world and can take control.  The priests who are called to do battle are the last of a dying breed.  Today we use psychology, therapy, group treatment, medication, etc but at times, it seems, when all else fails, radical approaches are required.   <br /> <br />Martin is a spokesman for pre-Vatican II, a conservative former priest who still holds to beliefs in evil, Satan and the Church. His books reflect his beliefs and it is hard to argue that the Catholic Church has improved as an institution since instigating the reforms.	2004-08-13

We are dealing with military misfits and instead of the deeply troubled priest, we have the deeply troubled psychologist. The story is not as action-filled as one may like but the way in which the various layers are laid bare is a wonder to behold. <br /> <br />One slowly grasps \\"the twist\\" made all the more poignant by those involved (no revelations from this reviewer).  The ability of the mind to withstand the evil that men do has never been so tested, nor have the reactions to that evil been so effectively dramatized.   There is a longing at the end, a sadness and yet a confirmation of all that is good.  The rendering of the various personalities was a tour de force of imagination - they still resonate at time.	2004-08-13

What is not generally understood is the degree of politics and pressures that accompany the election of every Pope.  Today, with the waning of Catholicism, the emphasis is not on theology or who can lead the Church Triumphant.  Instead it is on how best the Church can function in an increasingly secular society.  <br /> <br />Martin has all the key players - the traditionalists hankering for the days of Latin and total obedience, the Liberation Theology type heady with leftist ideology, the \\"continue the same at all costs\\" type and the \\"let's form an alliance with secular groups\\" type.  It is difficult to grasp the author's own prejudices (I think a combination of traditional and make new friends).  The story is based on the politicking that went into making John Paul I the Pope and his alleged \\"betrayal\\" once he understood how dire the situation really was.  Although it is dated, it is still a good read.	2004-08-13

Patricia Anthony's focus has always been with relationships and the human experience - some might say dilemma. She highlights these two elements by using aliens as background noise...they are not so different from us after all OR they are so different we can only relate to one another. <br /> <br />Post-nuclear Texas, a small town has been cut off from the rest of the world by an invisible shield erected by aliens who live among them.  The incongruous element was that life went on as normal without a lot of consternation.  It is a typical town with an evangelistic preacher, love affairs, law breakers and a tired, guilty Chief of Police.  A murder has occurred at the start of the book and the search for the killer forms the germ of the plot. <br /> <br />Yet...and this is the reason for the four stars, when all is said and done, there is more said than done. (WARNING -SPOILER) One could almost sense that the entire six years of the barrier was surreal.  What is even more perplexing is that everything that occurred in the town actually happened only in another setting. Instead of hanging a condemned man, we discover he has hung himself in his prison cell in the \\"real world\\".  No one understands, least of all the people involved, and when they emerge they discover that the world has carried on as before. <br /> <br />So, is it a commentary over taking life for granted, over what is possible in the universe of reality, on the meaning of reality itself.  Your guess is as good as mine.  But read the story for the richness of the characters (the moment when he finds out about his wife and deputy is a classic) and the effectiveness of the dialogue.	2004-08-13

And along the way the intricate plot and superb action carry the story along almost breathlessly.  I can still remember sitting down to read this and suddenly recognizing that I would not be leaving the house until I had finished. <br /> <br />Blatty has a way with words whether used as description or dialogues.  The subject matter is, of course, the age-old rite of Exorcism, long since abandoned by almost all religions except a few Catholics.  As the book says, we may never learn for certain of the existence of God, but we know beyond doubt that Satan is alive and well.  The fact that the victim was a young girl, that the mother was a non-believer, that the priest doubted and that the Exorcist had encountered this demon once before all made the book unbelievably realistic. <br /> <br />The movie sensationalized the trivial, enhanced the special effects, emphasized the very things that the book downplayed. And while Blatty's next work, \\"The Ninth Configuration\\", is not the heart-stopper this one is, it is another great look at the psyche of evil resident within us all.	2004-08-13

Now I know that if it was in a normal font, it would have been pitifully shallow.  After reading the first page you know immediately how the story will turn out.  Not only that, you also know exactly how the action (quote unquote) will progress.   <br /> <br />I hate to say this, but it reminds me of a woman writing for women; the author seems to have no real grasp of either the world of spydom, the military or the way men think.  All the characters appear to be from movies, even the best realized one of all- Evan (the teenager).  Too many names, not enough personality, CIA, FBI, special agents, blah blah blah.   <br /> <br />The plot is standard soap opera - some guy suddenly learns that he has a child and must do something spectacular relating to his profession (almost always militay/intelligence).  The mom is killed and who should walk into the room but grownup, now-gorgeous little sis who, as in all stories like this, is wealthy and independent.  <br /> <br />Bad guy is a South American drug lord who, for some reason, wants to assassinate the President (as if that would alter US drug policy).  Our hero is forced to shoot bad guy's son and bad guy gets even by capturing the boy he never knew he had. Lots of give and take - sister and hero bed, son suffers, snore snore until dad reaches son.  Again, as in those made-for-TV two hankies, the boy has admired his (missing) dad for years and they bond right before, in James Bond fashion, he takes out the bad guys and discovers a traitor. <br /> <br />Epilogue: Dad and son fishing when out comes now-pregnant wifie, former little sister...and they all lived happily ever after. <br /> <br />	2004-07-28

I gave five stars despite a few misgivings - simply because the story was so entertaining.  <br /> Downers: <br /> 1. The worn-out big business is bad/raping the land, etc. I've alwasy thought devices like this were symptoms of intellectual laziness (much like a destroyed Earth in Scifi or murdering for insurance in mysteries or monsters caused by pollution in horror)  <br />  <br /> 2. The lack of development of the main character. Joey is fun and humorous and vibrant but nothing close to Chaz, the featured player or Tool, who plays a close second. This may be because the writer is a man and finds it easier to write about them.  <br />  <br /> 3. Ending - inconclusive <br />  <br /> Now for the good -  <br /> 1. The plot device <br />  <br /> 2. Mick (although like others I would like to have learned more about his past) <br />  <br /> 3. Tool (a ********** bonus) His entry and story rivals the main action and almost dominates it. His character is the most realized, the one who &quot;developed&quot;, the most interesting, the most &quot;realistic&quot;. The encounters with Maureen were near perfect.  <br />  <br /> 4. The ending (yes, it is also a weak point) But the very vagueness of it is satisfying while not explanatory. <br />  <br /> I look forward to reading other books by the same author. <br />  <br />	2004-07-26

In this book, a work that includes humor, mystery and science fiction, she ruminates on politics, culture, the future. The further one delves, the more one understands and admires the hero,(Reen-ja) and his travails. <br />  <br /> The only word to describe character development (Ms. Anthony's forte) is awesome. The President journeys from pitiful rambling politician to tragic hero. Marian carefully plots the dangerous path that brings betrayal and heartbreak. Reen succumbs to that most human of emotions, love, though he cannot change his nature. A cosmic tragedy awaits the only two sentient races in the Galaxy - humans the termites. These humanoid aliens evolved from insects and as such are hive creatures with allegiance to their Brothers and Cousins. Their life is set at birth (an aside to much like the still-strong Indian caste system). Both termites and humans are losing the ability to reproduce. In the termites case, the vast majority are now born mindless workers.  <br />  <br /> The termites have undertaken to fuse two races into one that will stand the test of time. Experiments begin and children are born. We encounter murder, kidnapping, torture, investigations and surprises. The humor is always present - some of it slapstick but always with an edge. In fact the entire story has a shadowy nervousness as if one were waiting for the other shoe to drop. The commentary on rituals, customs,what it means to be human, are insightful and thought-provoking. <br />  <br /> The incredible ending with Reen's final thoughts was not only tragic but triumphant, a classic case of martyrdom for our fellow man or in this case, fellow termite. The reader feels a deep sadness mixed with a sudden understanding as we grasp not only his shock but acceptance. The scene of his traitorous brother, attempting desperately to stop the sacrifice, remains with the reader long after the book was closed.	2004-07-20

If you want cogent military drama, probable future projections or realistic politics, then walk on by. It's the future and (naturally) the world is in ruins by man's wicked ways. The Arabs have invaded Europe because - as one officer put it, &quot;They are hungry.&quot; Yeah, right. Not to conquer the infidel or force Islam but for a nice plate of pasta. <br />  <br /> Let's get the bad parts out of the way. Weaponary is dated - apparently in the future missles and airplanes are banned. All actions seems to be on the ground. The invasion of Eastern Europe is susiciously similar to the earlier invasion by the Turks under Saladin. A virtual fighting machine is introduced but it is vague, more description than real. Secondly, politics are wacko - Libyans, Moroccans, Egyptians and Algerians who have been bickering for centuries suddenly unite. And while Europe will probably be Muslim within a century it will be due to the loss of will, not an invasion.  <br />  <br /> Good parts: The ephemeral nature of the aliens, the &quot;Virtual&quot; world in which the captured humans lived, the way the personal problems were introduced, the ending.	2004-07-20

They rejected no one from their schools, they gave a high status to women and all learning, they reformed (though not completely) the Catholic Church but more important thant all that, they preserved the Codex of Western Civilization.  That is, they copied (on sheepskin) the works of Plato, Aristotle, Roman poets, Greet playwrights, bawdy tales, Bibical studies = they saved it all.  <br />The story of the Irish, their brilliant past , magnificent actions and ultimately, sad fate is a backdrop to the story of the rescue of civilization. When Europe fell to the horde, it was not the disappearance of cities, churches or customs that mattered - it was the destruction of books.  A great tale by a great writer.	2004-07-06

I love how she keeps reintroducing old characters later in the series.  Sally was one of the best and of course there is Ranger and Monelli and the continuing rivalry between the two.  I wish she would pick one and get it over with but it now seems that Ranger wants sex without obligation and Monelli wants love without marriage.<br />The gang writing was very good, the nihilidm and hopelessness of the inner city \\"lifestyle\\" described to a \\"T\\".  I suppose in a series one can't help but repeat oneself but I, for one, am tired of the car burnings and smart alecky Grandma Mazur.

Notice I did not say technically brilliant (I mean, who is going to attempt it who is not a technical wizard?) or the cleanest or the most authentic - but the sensuousness and Romanticism or the work shines through.  <br />This is also true of the other Liszt works on the CD.  The two etudes are not the fire and brimstone type usually associated with the composer but are mature, Romantic, deeply felt works. Indeed, the entire CD has an almost religious aura surrounding it, particularly considering the inclusion of Benediction de Dieu dans la solitude and teh Valee d'Obermann.

The hero seemed to have no grief for his murdered son but kept on with appointments, plans, meetings, sex, etc as if nothing had happened.<br />The trick of killing anyone who could possibly contribute to the depth of the story (agents, policemen, bad girl) was pushed to the extreme.

The premise of the story sounds captivating, a wonderful idea.  But the execution is...not necessarily lacking but never reaches the lofty height of the original idea.  <br />Our hero(?) is in charge of making androids, synthetic humans who do the drudge work of society.  These creatures are designed with little ability to interpret emotions or interact with reality.  They do their jobs and shut up.  Hal Briggs decides to change all that by building a new Adam and Eve.  A secondary story is that of the looney supervisor who falls in and out of love and is certificable.  <br />Hal himself is an unlovable characters, as forgettable as the androids he designs.  For that matter, all the characters in the book (however interesting they appear) do such mundane things that they tend to disappear.  This is a depressing novel, one in which people are seen as a cog in a machine, no more important than the phony androids they design.  Is there a parable in all this that I did not comprehend? <br />The escape and their ensuing tales was the best part.  Of course there is a reunion and the pregnancy at the end leaves the whole question open to doubt.  Will we survive or better, should we survive?	2004-07-05

(Get your act together, Amazon!)  ALas, it is not a review of the casette either.  It is a review of the CD of the same name - Amazon, where art thou when needed?<br />I bought my CD off of EBay for ten bucks - a steal.  The sound on this recording is grand, rich and romantic all at the same time.  The Rieger Organ at Holy Trinity Episcopal Church is a stunner, a real gem that has an Old World German sound but also has the color of the famous French organs.  <br />Besides the fine organ, there is a great artist. Anthony Newman is a master of interpretation, a technician of the first order, a superb artist.   In my opinion, there has NEVER been a finer recording of Reubke's Sonata on Psalm 94.  He maintains a stunning but justifiable tempo throughout whereas almost every other recording seems to literally drag right before the fugue or makes an unholy mess of the C major entrance.<br />Widor is well represented (The Toccata from the 5th and the Allegro from the 6th), the magnificent Liszt Fantasia and Fugues on &quot;Ad nos, ad salutarem undam&quot; and the Toccata in B Minor by Gigout, a fresh interpretation of a much-heard work.  Newman is an exact executioner with a flair for the Romantic.  Long may he be heard!	2004-07-05

What is so atypical about this story is/are the many genres covered - history, mystery, science fiction, religion - and each and every one superb. The novel is a virtual time machine (reminiscent of Carr's &quot;The Alienist&quot; in that respect).  To step into such a &quot;foreign&quot; time and place - Portugal, the Inquisition, the pre-Industrail Middle Ages, the budding of science and the Renaissance and the resistance by the Catholic Church - do &quot;Become&quot; a reporter of those times is a task that few will undertake and still fewer accomplish well.<br />The aliens remain at a distant, known through vague and illusive visitations and in the end, are in the end as mysterious as they were when first mentioned.  The Jesuit hero, the man who assists the inquisition despite his own sins and inner thoughts, is as real as any character I have ever encountered.  His lover is an altogether different person but incredibly attractive in her own right.<br />The portrayal of a society mired in mysticism, ruled by an Iron Fist of religious zealotry, is intimate and just - even fair. The lives of people below the surface, beyond the public utterances of loyalty and fealty and devotion, is what attracts one to the many varied characters.   The young Father Bernardo  becomes a foil for all that is right and wrong with the Church of that age. <br />The parallel story of the retarded King Alfonso and his brother Pedro meshes beautifully with the tale of aliens and unrelenting persecution by the Inquisition. In a brilliant move, the living machine of the aliens (the &quot;acorn&quot;) imbues this retarded prince with advanced scientific ideas that he feels compelled to share. The ending finds one breathless with anticipation and dread, hopeful yet at the same time resigned to the inexorable chain of events that must happen.  There is no intervention - either military, divine or alien.Things play out to a horrible but strangely satisfying conclusion. This is an incredibly vivid work, soaring and shocking and in the end, meditative.	2004-06-21

What is surprising - once one gets past all the soundbites of the media - is that he was incredibly curious about the world (in a sense, reminescent of Clinton) but at the same time held an optimistic, almost youthful outlook for the American people that never faltered once.<br />As I said in my review on Reagan: Letters, his was an intellect unlike Nixon, Gore, Dole or Kerry.  He did not think in terms of politics first but always in terms of people.  He was (as one reviewer aptly noted) at heart a libertarian, revealed by his comments on adult drug usage, religion, taxes and personal freedom. This most abused of Presidents (think Hollywood and academia) effectively reshaped America and the world in his image - an accomplishment of outstanding proportions that few Presidents can approach.  <br />It is not surprising that he supported Goldwater, another closet Libertarian.  (I love his comment on election day, &quot;I voted for a few Democrats.&quot;  Can one imagine a comparable comment from Delay or Clinton?) I liked the rough letters - it shows us a mind in the process of arriving at a final thought.  Sometimes the marked out parts are more informative than what remains.  Once again, the intellectual range covered within these words is simply astounding - economics, philosophy, the proper role of govt, the correlation between economic and personal freedom, human motivation... One notes again that these are PHILOSOPHICAL (not political) undertones - no quick and easy answers on such questions as minimum wage, quotas, throwing money at education, mass transit, welfare...these were almost too pedestrian for someone determined to change America and the world.  <br />To quote another reviewer, RR possessed one of the rarest of qualities - emotional intelligence.  He recognized why people did what did and continually sought tomake American into a place where everyone could reach their full potential.  Another outstanding contribution to the political literature!	2004-06-16

It is the kind most kids want to see from their parents, the type parents desire for their children, one where they are newlyweds for 50 years.  Patti Davis said she knows her father loved his children but when Nancy walked into the room, there was no one else. Just perfect!!  <br />These letters reveal a man helplessly and deeply in love with all his heart.  If this is corny or childish, so be it.  The world would be a better place if relationships could be this strong. He says it over and over, &quot;You are my life, you saved my soul.&quot; The President could wax poetic and plumb the depth of emotions, something few ever manage. The letters were not only loving and tender but also erudite, witty, colorful and quite  original.  (My favorites are those written in the same room or those in which he refers to himself in the third person.) This is perhaps one of the best personal portraits of an American President that exist.<br />The letters range over a period of several years and contain some biographical data.  Just to set the record straight, the proceeds from this book went to an Alzheimer's fund; the family received not one penny.	2004-06-15
630462:US	52706646	R1MIT5GFYUANDS	074321966X	146281138	Reagan: A Life In Letters	Books	5	11	13	N	N	A philosophical  - NOT political - outlook	I read this book in a couple of settings one weekend and reviewed it immediately.  During this last week (RR died) I took it down and read it with a new perspective, one influenced not by the sometimes tawdry and hypocritical media coverage but by the words of world leaders, common citizens, reporters - a wide cross-section of Americans who came to the same conclusion about the man.<br />It is the height of participatory irresponsibilty to slam a book (as some reviewers have done) based on politics.  We will surely see reviews of the type: \\"Clinton's new book is bad because he (fill in the blank) committed perjury, paid off a woman to avoid a sex case, conducted a tawdry affair with a bimbo, humiliated his wife and daughter, etc..\\"  All these are true but should not be the basis for a book review.<br />What IS surprising in this book is the incredible depth and range of RR's intellectual ramblings. He possessed humility, an unending optimism and a firm belief in the goodness of the American people and the greatness of America. Subjects vary from war to socialism, monetary policy, education, science, manners, parenting, religion, evolution, custom, Greek & Roman influence, psychology, philosophy and particularly that most human of emotions, love.  Letter writing of this kind, with pen and paper, is a dying art.  It would be even more telling to review the original documents that were works in progress. <br />This most castigated of Presidents - \\"Hollywood actor\\" - had one of the most wide-ranging intellects ever to occupy the White House. Another reviewer noted Reagan's \\"emotional intelligence\\" - an apt commentary illustrated by his ability to confound the so-called \\"experts\\" time and again. Thatcher picked up on this in her eulogy with the idea - readily seen in these pages - that he had a few beliefs that were deep-seated, unchanging, and in the end, validated.  <br />Most importantly, this book illustrates that these beliefe were philosophical NOT political - a point rarely noted. Rather than work on parceling federal funds to political allies, he worked to unshackle the economy and the result was a 20 year boom that continues today.  Rather than co-exist Soviet aggression he made the bold step of offering friendship. He was no policy wonk but a great student of human motivation. It was his private beliefs that gave strength to his public pronouncements, come to life in these pages.  This collection is an apt summation for a life lived well and full.	2004-06-14

How else to explain the refusal of Jews to leave Germany before WWII or currently, the blindness in regard to the growing anti-Semitism we see everywhere around us?<br />Anti-Semitism has migrated from Christianity and settled in with Islam and the Left. At one time no respectable person would dare claim to be anti-semitic - it was only the uneducated, the ignorant, the fools.  As noted by the author, suddenly it's in to be prejudiced and strangely intellectuals are leading the charge - from European capitals to college campuses. While some of this, the author notes, started as anti-Israeli feelings it has quickly evolved into an anti-Jewish message that is barely concerned with providing intellectual cover. And it brings nary a protest!<br />General Zinni was interviewed and named those responsibile for the Iraq mess. His answer was telling - he named five Jews in the administration - not the VP, not Bush, not Rice or Rumsfeld. No, five Jews.  When this was pointed out he stated that he did not know the faith of the five, sopmething so hard to believe as to be dismissed out of hand. The real story is that he sought to blame Jews for our troubles (shades of the Black Plague) and nearly got away with it. Not suprisingly he is pro-Arab. This was followed by dottering Sen Hollings who woke up to blame the war on &quot;Jewish interests&quot; then said he was not blaming the Jews - Go figure.<br />The book does not answer the psychological or emotional reasons for this trend perhaps because there is no answer for irrational thinking.  The answer is found in ideology.  The European (and increasingly American) Left supports the Arab cause in the ongoing Middle East battle.  The question of WHy an intellectual would choose religious fundamentalists, thugs and terrorists  over a Western-oriented society that allows dissent is a question that must be answered in another book.<br />But the fact remains, as the author notes, that anti-Semitism is a function of most Arab governments and this brainwashing has spilled over to its inhabitants who regularly march in protest - not for political, economic or religious freedom.  No, crowds  proclaim their hatred of Jews and their fervent wish to exterminate them. <br />The book is well-documented but given Zinni, Hollings, NPR, the Cairo Times and the hate spewing from Damascus, Pakistan and Iran and the voice of terrorists murdering &quot;Jews&quot; on film, exactly, uh, how detailed must one get?  This is an important book that should be updated frequently with the latest signs of this most disturbing of trends.	2004-05-31

HARD FALL was a great read, a good thriller with wonderful human interest stories. It was not the interplay between action and people which was almost seamless or that Daggett was so likable or that Carrie, Lynn and Monique were interesting characters who were brilliantly portrayed or that the plot was credible. All that is true but what kept harking back to me was the seemingly silly effort to give the mass murderer a &quot;human face&quot;, justifications for doing evil because he had experienced grand tragedy. Take away 1/2 point.<br />There is no excuse for purposely murdering innocent people. On the other hand he shows how a political movement (ecology in this case) can become the germ for terrorism. + 1/2 point. The setting is good, the murky European background handled well, the madness and genius of the killer aptly described.  The dual love stories and the father-son bond were superb tales in themselves and the way it all intertwined was a joy to behold.  A little dated but still an excellent read.	2004-05-30

Accepting the premises of this moviebook means disregarding the dire, failed prophecies from the same groups - mass starvation, half of all animal species wiped out, coastal area inundated, huge rise in cancer due to ozone thinning...don't hold your breath for a correction. <br />Under the direction of a Spielberg this could have emerged as poetic with real cinematic beauty. But Emmerich has all the finesse of a nuclear bomb and his inability to mix the personal and the computer have never been more apparent. Then we have a hack like Strieber (of &quot;aliens among us&quot; fame) to &quot;interpret&quot; the movie.  It's bad because if reflects the film.  The NYT reviewer notes that the audience guffawed throughout and that about sums up the attitude of almost every major critic from Rolling Stone to Newsday who savaged the thing.<br />The only thing worse than reading rubbish is having to watch a fine actor like Dennis Quaid deliver it on screen. (He tries hard but it's too much.) The sheer miscalculation of intent is incredible. The &quot;scientific&quot; jabber intended as a sign of authenticity instead sounds like Porky Pig discussing Quantum Mechanics.  The stupidity never ends - he gets on his snowshoes to walk to NY (from Philadelphia!!) The book and the movie are disasters and I am not talking genre.<br />Character growth (LOL) is nil.  Indeed, despite the end of the world as we know it, people stay calm, accepting the end  - all that is except the evil VP (Cheney).  It's reported that multiple retakes were necessary due to the hilarious reaction of the actors to their &quot;lines&quot;.  Just as in Independence Day and numerous scifi books, ONE man alone knows the answer and can save the world. Yeehaaaaw! <br />See the movie WITHOUT dialogue for a much better time.	2004-05-29

On one side are scientists and historians who have stated plainly why they consider it a fake. On the other side are &quot;true believers&quot; who insist - despite all evidence to the contrary - that it's the real McCoy. Observations of the skeptics sound dry, even dull, since they only deal in subatomic comparisons, chemical makeup, etc.  Absent are references to ancient tales, myth, conjecture, wild surmises and pleas to &quot;faith&quot;.  The authors sound like UFO enthusiasts in their ability to find evidence of aliens in burn marks on trees.  The various theories expounded - that it was the serving cloth of the Last Supper - contradict the Bibical story. The linking of the Oviedo cloth (the napkin of Jesus) ignores the fact that there were hundreds of such napkins and that it was stored next to a vial of Jesus's blood!<br />I began with an open mind but the incredibly detailed tests of McCrone, Rober Hedger of Oxford and especially, the three sites selected by the Vatican in 1988 for authoritative dating (all found a date of 1350) were more than convincing.  Plus, if one took the author's viewpoint that the cloth is somehow telling us a story, one must ask the obvious questions:<br />In an age of relics, where was it? In the fight against the Muslims why was it not used as &quot;evidence&quot;?  Why is there no head to head joint as would happen if folded?  This book reads like one of Dale Brown's novels about Mary Magdalene, conspiracies, ancient cabals, secret cults, hidden meanings, etc.  There is even rivalry over whether the impression was by natural or supernatural causes. If one accepts it as genuine one must necessarily accept that a man rose from the dead, walked through walls, was born from a virgin, was actually God (and his own father)and rose and disappeared in the sky. <br />What is more likely?  That a fire in 1500 changed the dating by1350 years or that a cloth from the year 30 was carted around the known world, hiding and re-emerging, or that 3 independent labs selected by the Vatican correctly found a date of 1350? You be the judge.  Conclusion:  All the wishing and hoping and stretching will not change the fact this is a beautiful act of faith by a medieval artist.	2004-05-27

This is an important message, particularly in this morally relativistic age where intellectual support (and justification) of authoritarian regimes is at an all-time high. The terrible truth is that totalitarian regimes do horrible things to their own people without qualms.  <br />Popper demolishes the idea that a planned society is somehow preferable to a free one. A planned society is necessarily a static society, i.e. Eastern Europe and the USSR since 1945; the exact opposite is true of dynamic, continually evolving open societies. A casual look will convice all except the loonies still &quot;waiting for the Revolution&quot; that a liberal, market-driven culture produces goods and services that an authoritarian one cannot.  <br />But his other arguement is deeper, more subtle. An open society is intrinsically more powerful for its intellectual machinery.  It is not the material wealth of the West that should be admired (or disparaged if you are of that type). It is our intellectual dominance - particularly the US - that is so overwhelming. And it is true in all areas - scientific research, inventions, art, music, science...open societies excel, planned societies falter. <br />This is Popper's strongest arguement for an open society - the  relationship between economic and political freedom. It is not possible to have one without the other over the long haul.  Yet, Popper touches on what might be considered the greatest weakness of our own success - the idea that material wealth leads does not require political freedom or participation.  In this era of slogans, sound bites and everyone from actresses to radio hosts to rap stars dispensing political advice, it is important to remember that an open society exists only so long as citizens choose freedom through informed choices.  Intellectual laziness or (worse) depravity is the first step to cultural decline.  An important, readable work.	2004-05-21

This is his tale of woe as he quickly discovers that it is not all that he thought it was. He goes on to describe a life of sex, strange rules, violence, barracks humor, sex, North African life, sex, violence...you get the idea.  <br />At times the author is unintentionally funny but most of the events seem, shall we say, a little off the wall.  What the author attempts to do (and fails) is draw the distinction between the reality of the Legion and its outside perception.  The reason I say \\"fails\\" is because, despite the many and sundry descriptions of wild, cruel or inhumane behavior, the author seems to have joined in and liked it.  There is an air of admiration about some of the sickest/worse scenes presented.	2004-05-16

The ONLY reason this tale merits more than one star is the tremendous idea on which the book is based and the arrangement of material into symphonic movements. The tale: An alien energy pulse (EMP) knocks out sophisticated electronic systems, all governments go bonkers and a woman in New Orleans has a plan to save the world.  What follows is an unmitigated disaster on almost every element - characterization, plotting, authenticity, social comment, science...you name it.<br />There is enough here for three books:  Voodoo, globetrotting,  New Age nonsense, dire environmental warnings, unconvincing characters, nanotechnology, biotechnology (two fields the author continually crossbreeds) and space travel.  And that doesn't include the UN military force (a la black helicopter) or the socio-economic comments that sound like Daffy Duck attempting Mandarin.   <br />The sheer number of stories prevent any of them from standing out. The evil government forces are never seen, heard from nor given a chance to explain their actions.  Marie (our erstwhile heroine) is attempting to set up a new type of human society, Crescent City, somewhere in the Gulf that will operate &quot;without a government&quot; according to bio/nano technology - as if these fields contained moral truths for humanity. The author seems clueless about the real world and of course the action is totally illogical and improbable. <br />Let's see:  A Tibetan learns the secret of the messages, cities secede from the United States, the future revolves around nanotechnology, jazz, New Age tripe and a &quot;mixture of socialism and capitalism.&quot;   My pet peeve (and not just here despite the breakdown of society, the return of barter and barbarism, and the presence of conflicts,  science and scientific advances continue unabated. That is NOT the way the world works. THis is just so pathetic. We start a slow slide reaching the nadir on the last page.  Not Recommended unless trapped in an elevator.	2004-05-16

Chaz and Muriel are the ideal couple, if by ideal you mean wearing masks, playing games fit for deSade, sharing a young neighboy boy and living the good life.  <br />Keith falls for both of them and makes love to each of them, singularly and together. The games begin casually, a greeting or an invitation to drop over, a telephone call, a furtive vision of kinky domestic life.  They pick up steam as the neighbor is caught in the increasingly reckless and wild activites that now include bondage, violence, masks, knives, sex (with both) and that always open invitation to do more.<br />This is about a lot of very amoral people who wouldn't know right from wrong if it was wrapped up like a present.  What was supposed to be a coming of age tale became a kinky, heated, revelatory expose of strange suburban happenings.  The ending, though shocking, is almost a denoument.	2004-05-16

He was not only a child, though, he was an instigator, planner, creator of that weird era.  He became leader of a social movement and no story better illustrates the power of such media-driven movements. First of all, they have the ability to make ordinary people interpret the world in terms that differ from reality. Thus, we are subjected to daily litanies of the awful environment while the US (again) tops the UN list of nations with the cleanest water and safest food.<br />The other power of social movements is the manner in which all sorts of crimes are permitted for the \\"good of the movement\\".  Ira was a showman who not only caught the leading fads and trends but created them. Thus he joined New Age idiocy (UFO's, ESP, conspiracies at every corner) with ecology where he was the instigator of the preposterous \\"Earth Day\\", a celebration that has now become a financially successful cottage industry. Add to that radical politics, drugs and sex and one has the recipe for a disaster. Repeatedly he outwitted politicians who attempted to cash in on the latest craze.  Through sheer showmanship and continual media self-promotion he established himself as the man around town.<br />Around this time enter one Holly Madux, former high school cheerleader from Texas and susceptible to his many charms. Five years later she \\"disappears\\".  Skip forward and her body is found in Ira's apt, he is arrested and with the help of Arlen Specter (R-PA) he is released on a $40,000 bond and skips the country.  He resurfaces in Ireland only to disappear again.  Finally, in 1997 he was caught in France, still proclaiming his innnocence.  <br />Friends felt he had deserted \\"the Cause\\" though he is fondly remembered for his power as an organizer, facilitator and power broker - perhaps his true calling.  His private life was, of course, much different from his public persona and apparently involved cruelty toward his lovers.  In his latest interviews one almost gets the sense of entitlement for commission of a crime due to his past actions.  A sad, touching, horrifying, eye-opener of a book.	2004-05-16

It was a tale of adult  intrigue, romance, science fiction and an exploration of how longevity affects our society.  The totally inappropriate title (WELLSTONE) suggest a foray into the wondrous possibilities of this miraculous material but alas we are left with a young male coming of age story.  <br />This is not to say that the plot is bad or that the action is not authentic.  As the father of two teenage boys, the author nails it on the head with his descriptions of group rivalry, efforts to be liked, the innner thoughts of teenagers, their moods and quick jealousies and inability to control their mouth or their actions.  But it needed to be more than this.  The one outstanding device was the use of Conrad, the reflective lad who never tried to fool himself although he did manage to fool others.  The opening and the closing featuring the matured young man (who for some reason changed his name) are like bookends, enclosing a wild tale of rides to the heavens, group pranks and enough angst to build a wellstone cathedral.<br />Perhaps this was only a preliminary tale for the next in the series.  Hopefully the boys will have matured and their actions will be more attuned to adult conduct.  This is a good - though not great - read.	2004-05-11

This is pre-breakup of the Soviet Union though that was strongly suggested.  <br />He also discusses future possiblities of outbreaks, many of which are still pertinent today.  What is missing is ideology, the driving force behind the greatest mass murders in human history - China, Russia, Germany, Zairre, Sudan, Rwanda...in some ways the problems are unsolvable, dependent upon geography and resource allocation.

Martin Gardner, author of many science-for-the-people books is a contributor to that magazine and his articles are always delightful, sometimes controversial, always opinionated and extremely erudite.  This book is really a collection of some of these articles, arranged by category. <br />He is at his best when on the attack against the New Agers, the superstitious, horoscopes, ESP, magic, channelers, charlatans, Pyramid power and the like.  He demonstrates, step by step, the fallacy of their thinking and is just, even fair, in presenting the opposing viewpoint.  <br />The first article from the title of the book sets the tone.  In it he discusses how a theoretical flight of fancy (there are as many universes as we can imagine) became, for some, scientific fact despite not one scintilla of evidence.  But more than a discussion of the Multiple Universe Theory, it is an examination of the trend of mixing Eastern religious thought with science and producing a mishmash of pseudo-scientific lingo that is as trendy as it is illogical.  He takes on many icons - Karl Popper, Hemingway, Bettelheim and Gary Wills - and, like Paul Johnson in his great tome, INTELLECTUALS - finds monsters, egos and irrationality just around the bend.<br />He tackles various cultural movements, traces their history and their tragic results:  Cult leaders, Primal Screaming, psychoanalysis, Facilitated Communication and weird and little known individuals who made a mark at the time.  The quality of the essays are uneven and there is this infuriating obsession with fundamentalists of the Protestant persuasion.  He takes after them as if they were the Great Evil yet, as far as I know, no fundamentalist has murdered millions in religious wars, conquered nations in the name of God, slaughtered people due to their size or tortured millions &quot;for the Faith&quot;. For that, one must point to (respectively) European Christians, Islam, African tribes and Catholicism.  THis does not include the tens of millions slaughtered by secular regimes in this century.  <br />All in all, a good book, a quick read and another valuable lesson in the phrase &quot;seeing is not believeing.&quot;	2004-05-01

He/it is now a writing factory churning out novel after novel with LOTS of money thrown at HUGE marketing campaigns, guest appearances on television, nationwide tours...but precious little to show for it.  The DAVINCI CODE took an incredible idea, started like gangbusters then the story veered from interesting to improbable to hokey.  It fell under the weight of its incoherent mass. To make matters worse, Brown, in real life, is now going around claiming that the book was based on \\"real\\" research and hinted that the absurdities in the story could be true.<br />It's Angels & Demons (since it seems that novels referring to religion sell well) with worse plotting and even worse characters.  The plot is complicated though not complex - it is only Brown's inclusions of illogical and unprobable events that make the thing seem more a jumble than a race.  Then there's the awful portrayal of the people who are about as real as the wooden Indian at the barbershop.  They are as predictable as they are flat - they do things that don't really make sense and say things that happen to fit into the plot somewhat but where is the growth or change or transformation?<br />Other readers have noted the poor editing that is on display throughout the book. (I just had a horrible thought - what if it HAD actually been edited and this was the result?) Just because you appear on talk shows and sell millions of books does not mean a fact checker, linguist, and grammar expert are not required.  This is just pitiful.	2004-04-25

Actually, the addition of Bob was one of the best moves made by Evanovich.  Not only does he provide comic interest (and divert attention from the boring Rex), he is put to good use on Joyce's yard.  The inclusion of arch enemy, bad gal Joyce, is a sure winner - she's so bad she's good.<br />I hate to gripe (and give three stars) but Grandma's crazy talk and antics are getting a little old (pardon the pun). Highlights of the novel were her tryst with Ranger (at last), the return of perfect sis Valerie, and Mom's self-discovery. The villians were ho-hum, not really evil nor even dangerous like some in the past.<br />Lula's dialogue (another gripe) is also getting stale. If she is not mimicking Rambo she's stuffing her face.  How can one person eat the volume of food she does is beyond me. I don't know what is required but something different needs to happen soon.  It would not hurt if she and Morelli got married.  That would certainly introduce an entirely new wrinkle in the story. I'd love to see either (1) Stephanie on the trail of Joyce or (2) Joyce and Stephanie forced to work together to bring in a common foe.  Either would be a heck of a novel!	2004-04-23

He knew he would be excoriated by the Left for daring to break a taboo - silence on the issue of Soviet terror.  This is a strange book in many ways, self-reflective (a personal letter to his father comes at the end), historical, asking hard questions that have no answer.  Why indeed was/is Soviet totalitarianism a subject for laughter whereas German totalitarianism is an object of contempt?  Where are all the seminars, marches, studies, and forums on college campuses about the regime that murdered more people than any on the planet?<br />As noted in Jewish World Review, leftist rhetoric has an appeal: It is phrased so as to demand acceptance.  The idea of \\"social justice\\", group rights, equality, classless society, elimination of poverty and other such goals is alluring and is what first  attracted so many intellectuals.  The real question is why they remained faithful and silent long after learning that the USSR was a hell on Earth? More disturbing is that there still exists many - from NPR to college campuses - who find that past as something unworthy of negative comment on a level close to that of Germany or, absurdly, South Africa.  People are referred to (an NPR feature) as \\"former communists\\" with an equanimity that would never be acceptable for a \\"former Nazi\\".  <br />Amis shows that the 20 million dead (Bukovsky, the dissident mathematician, states the true number is closer to 50 million) were people, not statistics, and that they endured unbelievable horrors. It is not just whole villages that were uprooted, it is that an entire society froze with fear and suffered in silence as the West smiled. No wonder Stalin had such contempt for us. The individual vignettes are powerful, expository pieces that could affect the most cold-hearted activist still \\"waiting for the Revolution.\\"	2004-04-20

But she is now back with perhaps the finest in the series and it does not even involve bounty hunting.  <br />No, we are caught up in a search for a dottering uncle who has disappeared under increasingly mysterious circumstances.  There is, of course, guest appearances by Grandma, the dinners with family, Lula and more ominously, a decided tilt toward the mysterious Ranger in matters not only business but also personal. Of course, Morelli is still around to excite and tease poor Stephanice.<br />Each novel brings one or two unique characters.   FOUR brought the unforgettable transvestite and this one presents a midget (or &quot;small person&quot; as he prefers). He was an irrascible fugitive who somehow ended up staying with Stephanie.  The evil Rodriguez is also back to threaten our heroine.  The ending is a tour de force as the reader is left wondering who her romantic interest is for the night.  (She draws a name out of a bowl!!)<br />Great effort, quick read - rush out and get your copy.	2004-04-19

To reassemble living creatures that had been dead for 2 billion years from traces of burned DNA was just so...original.  And what made such an impact was how &quot;human&quot; our makers turned out to be and what literal devils the spider foes were.  There has never been a more sinister enemy, none more horrifying (the slasher monsters look tame in comparison). For once, the author does not attempt to show understanding or concern or empathy for such evil creatures but treats them like the unimaginable horror they are.  <br />The love affair was wonderful as was the story of the female explorer (the alien) who came to not only understand but empathize and finally side with humanity.  The understated character of the story was the captured school teacher who alternated between moments of temporary memory and sorrow and excruciating torture. The novel was a grand experiment that succeeded mightily.	2004-04-14

In fact I laughed out loud several times, something that a book can rarely invoke.  The story is an easy read but the circumstances, the family, Grandma and Joe all combine for a real pleasure.  I will say this with every book review by this author:  Why hasn't Hollywood pick up on this new heroine?

Just as I had written off the series as nothing more than rehash and repetition (Book III) here comes Janet with the best so far.  I wanted to shout a loud &quot;hurrah&quot; when Stephanie got together with Joe - this has been one long foreplay and now they get down to business.  Then there is the addition of arch-rival Joyce (we also get to meet ex-hubby/lawyer) as a bounty hunter.  Almost as good was the treatment Lula dished out to poor Joyce.  <br />Finally new character Sally, a transvestite, makes the novel a rollicking, frollicking picnic from beginning to end.  Poor Stephanie has more problems with cars than the rest of Trenton put together but she still has the old Buick and her family is still around, harping and carping.  &quot;Four&quot; is a classic!!	2004-04-14

Our hero is a genius who invented / worked with a product that is actually a miniaturized black hole.  Although the science is a little fuzzy this led to the creation of the greatest of inventions, \\"The Fax\\", which could not only send a clone of a person to another location but simultaneously fixed all that was wrong with the copy.  In other words, it guaranteed imortality.  <br />The world of the future is a matriarchy with a Virgin Queen (who just happens to love our hero).  An arch-villian, a desolute madman with the charms of a playboy, sets on a course that will destroy the Solar System.  It sounds outlandish but the way the future is presented, particularly with well stone and the amazing nano-technology (the descriptions are perfect), is truly amazing.  The tone and setting \\"sound\\" plausible.  Especially endearing was the way the hero allowed one robot to develop on his own.<br />This was an unlikely hit, mostly underground, the story carried by word of mouth.  I'd love to see this on the big screen but shudder at the horror that the editors would do - they would butcher the story, reduce it to a royal affair with about as much seriousness as a Mars candy bar.  The success of this book generaged another by the author,  a sequeal of sorts.  I can't wait to find out what happens!	2004-04-14

Instead what I got from this one was pure boredom. Perhaps it is inevitable that a series becomes a matter of filling in the blanks.  In this case, what started out with a bang has become a predictable succession of events.  Sure, many of these are humorous but we all know by now that Stephanie will endure her parents, Grandma will act strange, Joe will flirt and Lula will holler.  The series needs a little &quot;oomph&quot; to keep going.  The story was also not one of the best.	2004-04-14

The story of the dull bureaucrat who struggles to balance politics, great minds and personal crises is an old one but here it is given a new twist - he emerges the reluctant hero.  <br />Yes, I loved CONTACT which was a great book and an even better movie in my opinion.  But the relationship between cultures, especially the effects on humanity and how we define ourselves was better in HERCULES.  Particularly interesting was the inclusion of a psychologist who provided excellent comments and insight.<br />I am surprised that no one recognized or commented on the almost poetical nature of some of the translations.  These are simply beautiful renditions of &quot;alien&quot; thought made understandable to humans. They lifted the novel from the very good to the great. The &quot;group&quot; consciousness idea was yet another good addition and makes sense considering the ant and the honey bee.  All in all, a terrific read.	2004-03-23

The few things I dislike about the novels - the many minor characters or the practice of using &quot;headlines&quot; - are absent here.  Instead we have an exuberant celebration of the English language in all its glory.<br />It is the investigation of the human condition and the events that impact that condition that is the main concern of great writers.  And in this case, no one in science fiction comes close to approaching McDevitt's collection.  The short story as a literature form has come into its own lately but the quality has lagged behind.  Many writers need LOTS of pages and time to develop an idea to its fullest but McDevitt never fails. <br />It is his shrewd insight into the affairs of mankind, his hints and suggestions, the power of inference, the almost ephemeral nature of his characters's actions.  From the very subtle and very understated opening work from which the collection derives its name to the last, it is a series that inspires awe and deep thoughts - an almost perfect case of knowing just the right moment to pause and sometimes stop.  Magnificent!!	2004-03-22

The asides and comments were so cutting and so on point.  Loved Stephanie, Grandma Mazur(!), the cocky ex(?) heartthrob and even the evil bad guy was chilling and entertaining.  <br />If you are looking for a Patricia Cornwell or Elizabeth George, forget it.  This is a light, breezy, easy read that is perfect for the beach or the pool. If you've ever been  occupationally challenged (PC for \\"unemployed\\") and been reduced to selling off your belongings, this is the one for you.

It is outdated economically (the bid of millions was considered huge) and politically (Communist China was called \\"Communist China\\").  And the monolithic faith that supported the church against Marxist dictatorships is no more.  But it is a palpable, emotional, can't-put-it-down story.<br />The novel is two stories: A man whose family was killed in a fire has lost faith and lives in Japan. He meets a female reporter and an orphan girl the same age as his dead daughter. The girl is held hostage by a Japanese mafia type and will be sent to a brothel if he does not authenticate cetain papers. The plan is for representatives from \\"Red China\\" and the Vatican to bid on the (in)famous \\"Q\\" document. Bibical scholars know that the Gospels are not first-hand sources but derive from a general outline and used a \\"Q\\" document (for \\"Quelle\\" meaning \\"source\\") containing the sayings of Jesus. The document is a revelation, though, and will shake Christianity to its core for it shows Jesus as a raving zealot and Paul as a murderer. <br />The other tale is of Martin Buber, the Jewish philosopher, who allegedly worked with the Nazis and then was suddenly murdered. He is the one who found these papers and translated them in order for Hitler to \\"prove\\" Christianity a fraud and for the German people to accept him as a Messiah.  From Buber's diary they follow the story as he struggles then one day it is over. He is executed and no papers ever come forth.  Why?<br />That is the powerful ending of this short but rich tale.  A real winner for anyone who takes the time.	2004-03-15

So many Holocaust stories have been written that at times the process seems almost trivialized.  And this saga-like tale from Uris is a familiar one - Jewish persecution/extermination and their response in WWII Poland.  But the author somehow plumbs the depth of our emotions as he describes in an unrelenting yet calm tones the consequences of evil.  He does this while at the same time exploring the things we most associate with being &quot;human&quot; - love, bravery, family, religion, sacrifice.<br />There will never be another scene written like the one in which the Deborah, now blind and near the end, is comforted by the children's song from her brother.  It is just breath-taking, stunning in its simplicity, stirring the emotions as few passages can do.  The narrative is told via the viewpoint of the foreign author/journalist who becomes an unwitting hero in the struggle against evil. <br />There is no way to accurately describe how &quot;real&quot; the characters become - one could almost see Gabriella waiting at the local outdoor restaurant. These people are alive in the fullest sense of the word, flesh and blood, yearning to be free.  This novel surpasses EXODUS or QB VII and is far superior to any of his later works.  A must for any serious reader.	2004-03-12

It is with a heavy, Slavic accent in the \\"Russian\\" style - huge tomes, sweeping arcs of drama, a large cast of characters, death, repression, a cry for freedom and an attempt to make sense of both the internal and external world.  <br />Some reviewers both here and elsewhere have taken Grossman to task for suggesting that the Soviet regime was a mirror image of the Nazi state.  Both were collectivist societeis, both exalted group rights over the individual, both were run by a party apparatus, Both employed terror on their own citizens and remained in power through sheer force. Germany has had to atone for her crimes many times over but the Soviet state has yet to acknowledge the murder of up to 50 million people according to the mathematician dissident Vladimir Bukovsky. <br />The titantic struggle between these two forces forms the basis of the book.  But it is not just the battles; Grossman allows us to see the human behind the machine, the wants and needs and hopes of common people.  It is impossible for anyone who has not been in battle - particularly a siege - to grasp the futility and absolute unreality of the situation.  That is why the small deeds and everyday actions seem to stand out; they are subtle reminders of a time without war, normality and reason.<br />And in this theater of the absurd, Grossman documents the almost insane actions of the Soviet regime: The political commander's rabid focus on Marxist theory when people are starving, the wasting of human beings as mere objects, the violence and above all else, arguing Socialist theory amidst rubble, the dreary, gray, hapless lives in a totalitarain state.<br />There are some who can never bring themselves to criticize the Soviet regime and Marxism's utter failure in almost every field of achievement - economic, political, artistic, financial, scientific.  Grossman says yes, this is all true, but what counts are the pathetic lives of the unlucky but steadfast citizens caught in the grip of madmen; this is where the real crime takes place.  It ends in a silent desolation that is almost stifling.	2004-03-11

He introduces the soulful, enticing, and always interesting &quot;Hutch&quot;, the discovery of the Omega clouds and the presence of other sentient beings - First Contact twice removed one might say. Some have criticized the series (and his books in general) for their elusiveness, the almost ephemeral quality of the &quot;encounters&quot;, the lack of action (quote unquote) and the timidity and rationality of the characters. <br />It is for those precise qualities that I value the works of Jack McDevitt.  His sagas of alien encouters are more valid from a scientific point of view than most. It is doubtful that two intelligent cultures will exist at near the same technological level at the same time.  Our best hopes are discovering life in its infancy or civilizations long disappeared.  After all, our planet has sustained near-extinction events at least five times that we are aware.  Furthermore, unless we do venture into space as an exploring / colonizing species there is a good chance that life could be exterminated on our own planet by either local or external means.<br />The adventure on Quraqua was near perfect with its mix of human emotions, scientific endeavors and near-catastrophic ending. Once again, the clues planted in this story are explored and expanded in the following sections (and books).  Hutch is such a great character. I almost think of her as a &quot;real&quot; person.  She has a spunk and sense of humor in this book that is missing in others, but the reflection on herself and her follies. Also present are the inner reveries in which she contemplates mankind's place among the stars, the past and the future.  <br />Only a few cons - too many minor characters. If the character does not figure in the story use &quot;the captain&quot; or &quot;the guy that loaded boxes&quot; rather than a name and biographical information.  The reader is left waiting for something tohappen.introduce. The headlines, while understandable, are a distraction from the main story to this reader. Also, who really thinks it easier to  terraform another world rather than change your own...but these are quibblings compared to the slow, steady surge of the story as it moves inexorably toward its conclusion. I wish this had been the FIRST Hutch story I read instead of the last. And although this is another superb effort by a great writer I am still waiting for that magnum opus, that DUNE or 1984, that will not only satisfy the reader but also stagger the imagination.   Come on, Jack, hit the books!	2004-03-11

But that is not the case - this is the cloth in which Jesus was buried!  Notwithstanding the utter absurdity that a blood-stained cloth from a crucified leader of a small band of Jews would be whisked away to Europe and retained by a  band of monks, one of the Gospels (they contradict each other) states that he was wrapped in cloths (plural). But first a word about the man who started it all.<br />Kouznetsov claims that a fire \\"changed the atoms\\" of the cloth and that he has validated its authenticity.  THis Russian has been thoroughly discredited. He's been a Creationist since 1983 and attempted to \\"prove\\" his theories ever since.  Fraud has been the hallmark of his work. References include documents and books that do not exist; he invented outside sources to support his findings.  He was then declared persona non grata in Russia for claiming that several non-existent Russian museums provided him with old cloths that he then dated.  Yet this fraudulent scheme laid the groundwork for his claim that the shroud is original.<br />He found his calling among those who rejected the  findings of the original dating. The cloth HAD to be a relic - not a shrewd creation from the early Middle Ages when it first appeared in history.  This is yet another chapter in the dreary process of \\"proving\\" Christianity through scientifc rather than moral or theological means.  The author explains his side of the story and then give us an interesting conversation with another scientist as they discuss the issues.<br />The information about Dr McCrone, whose book on the scientific aspects of the carbon dating is excellent, is both biased and quite selective.  It is pitiful to see scientists substitute the alleged findings of a hack for the rigorous tests of the laboratory. The neutrality of the author is a joke but in a work about scientific evidence, this bias is deadly.bias is deadly.	2004-03-08

There are few face to face confrontations,  no big battle scenes or cases of alien-human love stories.  No, these are tales of scientists and explorers trying to come to grips with perhaps the most important question yet - are we alone? And once that's answered the next question arises - Where do we go from here?<BR> <BR>Like his other books, a strong female is the lead.  Kim reminds one a humorous and somewhat naughty &quot;Hutch&quot;.  But despite the occasional flippancy this is a very serious work, one that moves slowly like the latter organ symphonies of Widor that build upon previous themes all toward a majestic conclusion.  BEACHES is, without a doubt, his most philosophical work in both questions asked and answers given.  For once, he does not introduce too many minor characters but close to the subject.  <br />The genius of the novel is the way it expands from an almost insignificant event that recalls an unsolved disappearance. The story expands to not only a search for alien life but to a broad examination of human actions. The scene where the sister is recovered is second only to the last glimpse of Solly as he prepares to sacrifice himself for the woman he loves.<br />The writing is intelligent, almost poetical at times.  McDevitt has outdone himself with this almost perfect mystery which uses science fiction only as one element to further the tale. Highly recommended!!	2004-02-23

I was captivated at her uncanny ability to explain complex philosophical ideas and the ease and evident joy with which she fielded anudience questions- even from the enemy camp. Later I discovered the books and only after that did I learn of her personal life. The more one reads of that life the more one is astounded that she was able to produce anything with all the infighting, love affairs, bickering, struggles for control, etc.  Yet somehow she did and became a one-woman phenomenon.<br />Much of Walker's information comes directly from other sources. In fact, a large part of the text consists of &quot;and in PASSION, Barbara Brandon says...&quot; or &quot;Kay Nolte Smith describes the marriage as one of...&quot;.  I was looking for something new or a new way of looking at the movement but alas the only thing we get is writing with all the judgement and seriousness of a hack speech writer.  The writing, by the way, is strictly junior college caliber - no sense of flow or organization.<br />Is Objectivism a cult?  Absolutely.  Was Rand the worst person to ever live?  Well, according to Walker she comes close.  Her ideas were the result of (take your pick) her escape from the USSR, business opinions of the 1920's, pill popping or unhappy marriage.  She was uncaring, depressed, smoked, deluded, always had an answer and self-assured.  She's even taken to task for once being kind to an old man! <br />One must ask two questions:  How did this poor immigrant become a cultural icon and why were so many apparently intelligent people willing to sublimate themselves to her power?  Neither of these questions are answered.	2004-02-23

But in MADE IN AMERICA Bryson is back with a vengeance and has restored my flagging confidence.  <br />As is true with most of his books, it is more than it appears. It is the story of America with all its quirks, hidden history and unknown facts.  Some are uneasy with the new tales we learn here but when one recognizes that ALL peoples the world around strive to present to the world their best face, it is totally understandable. The same thing goes on today.  We do not want to hear of Clinton's everyday obscenity-laced tirades against enemies not of Bush's prediliction to waving his hand and accepting whatever is suggested.  No, we prefer a &quot;good economy and wise leadership.&quot;  We want the story, not the facts.<br />He begins at the beginning noting how from the very start, we chose to be different than our colonial masters.  We developed a way of speaking that was &quot;American&quot;.  If, as some scientists have predicted, the two forms of English continue to separate, American English may replace the mother tongue.<br />Bryson is full of little-known facts (some disputable) but one of his main thesis is that despite the size of the continent our own brand became more uniform within a few years than that spoken in the small mother country today.  We made learning and speaking a uniform English a second religion. He notes that our incredible industrial energies produced inventions and new names which continues today. The book not only looks at the history of the tongue but at specific areas (entertainment, politics, commerce, religion) in which wehave produced our own peculiar speech.  All in all a delightful read.	2004-02-16

Most people know that the stories from the New Testament, while beautiful and consoling, were written 40 to 60 years after the events described.  They are quite selective, adding up to only a few days.  And no one thinks Jesus went around addressing himself in the third person or especially that he proclaimed himself &quot;God's son&quot;.  The idea of God fathering a human child was a Greek concept and was considered  blasphemous by Jews.<BR>  <BR>The book almost shimmers as one is transported back to that ancient age.  It is a time machine in every sense of the word and the Jesus we meet here is a normal man with brothers and sisters and a mother. But he is troubled with visions.  The realization that something great is afoot comes to him slowly, in flashes, as if a puzzle were slowly being revealed. More than anything this Jesus is a man, not a God.  Yet he seems connected to the divine spark and in particular to the God of the Israelites.<br />We view his journeys, his love for Mary, his teachings which seem to emerge almost spontaneously, then that last epic week we know as the Passion.  The &quot;last temptation&quot; occurs on the cross in which Jesus is given a vision of the life he might could have. He marries, makes love, fathers children, works as a carpenter and lives happily.  But he rejects that vision and suddenly raises his head realizing he is still high in the air, nailed to the cross.  He did not flinch from his mission nor did he take the easy way out.<br />Theologically speaking it was condemened as heresy and banned by the Greek Orthodox church.  It was not meant as an official biography of &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; (many consider that his last name) but as what might have been.  And for that reason it deserves great kudos.	2004-02-16
784408:US	52706646	R1ZIISPKDYPNXE	0441011020	80979198	Chindi	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Great story with a few faults	CHINDI is part of a series of space adventures set in an Earth some 200 years in the future.  All of these feature Priscilla  (&quot;Hutch&quot;), a hardnosed by the book starship pilot and reluctant heroine.  All deal in some way with alien contact but he the author is very careful not to descend to the typical close encounter of the third kind where strange creatures teach little ole' mankind great moral truths like &quot;stop all war.&quot; No, his alien discoveries are furtive, accidental, perhaps even hopeless since a race may have decided to leave or has become extinct.  <br />McDevitt's ideas about alien culture seem almost too &quot;human&quot;. His aliens seem to operate under a similar evolutionary psychology of wants and needs aand that is quite impossible.  Regardless, the story is about the discovery of a giant alien vessel along with countless &quot;probes&quot; whose task it to record events on other worlds, including our own planet.  <br />Of course, they manage to enter the ship and discover that it contains actual footage of great events from other worlds, an endless history of intelligent life in the galaxy.  Once inside there are problems and a brilliant rescue scene (another of the author's favorite things).  Hutch falls in love, loses the man, then meets a man from the past who she discovers is her one true love. <br />Some reviewers complained that the ending falls short or is somehow diminuitive.   But the quiet tone in which we finally learn about the purpose of the ship speaks louder than any shoot-em-up, kill the bad guy, laser-missle battle could ever say. Throughout it all the writing is intelligent and probing.  <br />My main objection is the one I have to almost all his books - too many characters with little or no purpose.  Why he feels the need to introduce a string of people who may have one or two lines and usually are simply &quot;other captains&quot; or &quot;someone from the Academy&quot; is unknown.  The number of major characters should be whittled down to at most four or five.  Doing that would yield a perfect book.	2004-02-15

It appeals to almost anyone interested in the subject of buildings or architecture from a historical, engineering or aesthetic perspective. The color photographs and structural renderings are detailed and wonderfully realized. Each building is covered in two pages with a background of sort along with any unique engineering or structural problem that was involved.  The selections are a good cross-section of cultures.<br />I have yet to see someone pick this up without perusing and making a comment or two.  Color, extra long, thick paper.	2004-02-12

This time, though, the subject is not Judaism, America, WWI or the Enlightenment - it is an informal history of art given to us in Johnson's usual beautiful and opinionated manner.  I'm surprised that some reviewers have taken the author to task for not being \\"more detailed\\" or \\"not providingn more pictures\\".  <br />This is not meant to be a college textbook but instead a tome for the educated layman.  He begins at the beginning, when art first started and it was, of course, personal art - body art, clothing, crude tattoos.  It was only later on that the incredible cave paintings developed.  Despite the vast differences in perception between cave man and modern humans, Johnson concludes that art was undertaken for the simple reason that people found it enjoyable.<br />Once art had been classified as something distinct from normal activity, specialists developed.  And so we begin the journey from those who barely spoke to modern times.  Personally, I thought the book balanced the twin elements of illustrations and text.  It is a rare case of a work that tries to be all things to all people and surprisingly pulls it off.<br />This is an impressive looking book but it does not rely on its looks alone.  The prose is captivating and written with an obvious person love for the subject.  The various reasons for art, the schools, the cultures (with a heavy leaning toward European art) - are all discussed.  Throughout he makes clear his notion that art should reflect beauty and order and when it stops doing these things, it is more indicative of a society that the art itself.  Great read - buy it now.	2004-02-12

Although it's been done about a zillion times previously, the idea of a man-machine creation taking over the world could have been somewhat entertaining if the author had not wandered all over the place. The action/mystery parts - the chase, Rachel, fighting bad guys and bad girls - was the best.  <br />The worst parts of the book - well, there were several. First there is the utter predictability of the plot.  Mean old guys and gals at the NSA who murder on a whim, evil government and big business types, a Wizard of Oz talking head with whom one carries on discussions about metaphysics, the selection of the couple by the computer.  And what in the world did the visions have to do with the narcolepsy?  The Jesus connection was never explained and ridiculously, Jesus speaks in perfect King James lingo. Nay, Thou shalt not waste thy time reading this book from this moment forth! <br />The incoming missles, the last-minute wheeling and dealing with the President and evil Generals, the proclamation of love on the edge of destruction - enough already.  To top it off, the visions that were so important to the story and provided a kind of  structure to the novel as well as guide their journey were nothing more than wild imaginations we find out at the last. Philosophical mumbo-jumbo of the first order...even the science is bad. How can an entity understand emotions or any concept whatsoever without sensory input?  And is the ultimate end of evolution the merging of female and male into one being? Avoid at all costs.	2004-02-12

It easily rests on a coffee table and provides even the uneducated a nice &quot;picture&quot; book (the wood carvings are densely distributed throughout). Secondly, the writing is magnificent - soemthing rarely found in works of this type. The type is tiny so one is rewarded with substantial text and not fluff. <br />It is not a scholarly work although it contains considerable f scholarship. It is, instead, for the educated layman who wishes to know something more about the Reformation than Martin Luther nailed a paper on a church door. It traces the beginnings, the situation at the time and numerous other religious uprisings against the Church.  It visits many nations and many influences (politics, humanism, science, industry) and looks at the results of one of the most monumental events in Western history.  More than anything the Reformation gave rise to the modern state as we know it today.  It broke the stranglehold that Catholicism held on every aspect of daily life and the result was a flowering of industry, science, art and theology.	2004-02-08

It surmises that the Revoution was inevitable due to the actions of the ruling Tsar - WRONG.  The Revolution occurred because of Lenin and WWI. In 1913, Russia's economy was fastest growing in Europe.  She had liberalized and was coming into the modern world. Lenin's propaganda railed at military losses when in fact she was successful on 3 of the 4 fronts where she was engaged.  <br />The section headings, &quot;Rule by Rasputin&quot;, &quot;Nicholas rejects the Russians&quot;, etc says a lot about the historicity of this work. It does not even explain the Revolution well and how a motley crew of foreign-trained malcontents took control of the vast Russian Empire.  For a good work ont he subject of the Romanons get NICHOLAS and ALEXANDRA - excellent work.	2004-02-08

I am not talking about \\"rich merchants, slaveholders or landed gentry\\" or any of the other terms so in vogue to describe those who fought.  It is the British side, the Mother country, the land that gave birth to our own nation.<br />We were extremely lucky to have been colonized by England. They instilled in the colonies an admiration for representative and participatory government. Plus, the British were civilized. Revolts against Chinese, Russian, Mongolian, Turkish or African rulers were met with at a minimum devastation and normally, decimation.  India is free only beause Britain was the colonial ruler - Ghandi would have been helpess against any of the former mentioned empires. <br />The book, told through a combination of letters and commentary by the author is punctuated with portraits, maps, drawings and illustrations which serve to lighten the text.  We discover interesting side facts - the pay of various member of the army, songs of the day, customs, what soldiers REALLY thought. Strategy on both sides is detailed and the politics of the era is always a shadown overhanging the military conflict.  Great book if a little dry.	2004-02-07

Therefore I was eagerly awaiting this book.  One day I saw it, bought it and rushed home.  <br />Varlay is stretching for shomespun, &quot;ah shucks&quot;, humor in this one and he is stretching too far.  Sure, one must give license to every science fiction book but this one takes the cake.  You've heard/read/seen the story before told a million times and they are all interchangeable.  A group of misfits pal around doing nothing much then something happens to set things off and they accomplish things that no mere scientist or engineer would even attempt.  <br />Most of the time these tales are movies for the 12-15 year old set but in this case Varlay attempts the same thing for adults and it just doesn't work.  Jubal is too implausible, the structure doesn't make sense, the science is silly, the politics are all wrong and it takes about 15 cups of coffee just to get to some action.  I swear we go up and down that beach enough times to plow to China.<br />I had great hopes but it's like a dropout suddenly explaining how 3-D optical storage works.	2004-02-07

This work by Roy Medvedev the semi-dissident who was ousted from his leadership role in the party, deals with the first part of the collapse of the Soviet state.  The book's problems have to do with time - the author should have waited to have seen how it was going to turn out.  He stopped in 1989 just as the independence movement for the various &quot;states&quot; in the USSR were gaining ascendancy.  <br />The book suffers from not enough data.  The KGB files had not yet been opened and the wealth of information contained in them would be enought for 20 books.  At the time of the story, the coup against Gorbachev, the rise of Yeltsin and the onslaught by the Russian Mafia had yet to occur.  The author provides a lot of &quot;inside&quot; information, much of it the dreary, boring chatter interesting only to those who care about what men at the top of the ladder said. <br />The book is not ideological at all.  One gets the idea that the author prefers a Western European socialism with a touch of Russian authoritarianism.  This is not a denunciation of the pathetic outcome of Socialism or praise of the market system. It is, instead, concerned with who said what, the approaching new state and its structure, a look at the horrible conditions within the country before the collapse...a lot of data that needs some structure and organization. <br />The writing is pedantic as Stalinist architecture.  This is not worth your time.	2004-02-07

There is more to a war that reporting that this is how it started, this is how the fighting went, this is how it ended and this is what it meant.  The Korean War, a \\"police action\\" made possible only by the boycott of the USSR from the UN, was the first and last stand by the West against naked aggresion in the Cold War.  <br />It was a turbulent time, an age when American and Russia fought for supremacy and it seemed to many that communism was sweeping the world.  This war demonstrated that totalitarian governments come to power through force - they are never elected at the ballot box.  The political firestorm, the international and domestic politics, the geopolitical situation - all get short shrift here.<br />Instead we climb muddy hills, camp our with Turks, take small ridges, fire machine guns...you can't see the forest for the trees.  In this case the sum of the parts is NOT greater than the whole.  This might be useful in a course on military strategy and history but not as a description of the Korean conflict.	2004-02-07

No wizards, time travel, goblins or transport devices - just engaging stories and even more engaging characters. Deepsix is an Earth-like planet discoverd 20 years previously and abandoned after a disastrous visit. A unique cosmic event, a planetary collision, is days away when the planet will be consumed by a gas giant. Scientists and media gather to study/entertain when a building is detected on the surface - intelligent lfe. A search is undertaken and the fun begins.<br />DEEPSIX is a morality story on several levels. The first is the decision whether to rescue the group stranded on the planet.  Another is the interaction and reaction of the trapped group of people as they face inevitable doom. The last and the greatest is the discovery that 3,000 years earlier a heroic race of aliens attempted to rescue the local sentient beings from the Omega cloud (see OMEGA). <br />Hutch, my favorite pilot/explorer/scientist, is in charge. The way this character has grown and evolved over the course of several books is wonderful. The other main character is an older cynical writer who surprises even himself at the last. There are lots of adventures, a great rescue and a powerful epilogue.  <br />The writing is always literate, sometimes almost poetic.  The small quotes from the cynical reporter for each chapter are perfect.  My one gripe is the same as I have for all the novels in this series - too many characters.  You cannot appreciate someone who shows up for three pages and then vanishes. It detracts from the story without adding anything substantial.  Why, for example, are there FOUR ships taking part with FOUR crews and FOUR sets of passengers? A reduction in quantity will produce an increase in quality. Still it was a great read.	2004-02-07

Many review have castigated the author for his enormous ego. Well, I had never heard of him before (or since) - probably the worst thing anyone could say.  But I have heard of Horowitz.  In fact I have over a dozen recordings of Vladimir Horowitz and consider him the last of the titans in an unbroken chain from Lizst, ending with Horowitz. The Eastern Europe / Russian school will never again be equalled in passion, dedication and technique. The flaws in this book, where to begin?<br />(1) The smarmy way the author ingratiates himself with the pianist (\\"I'm your friend\\") then write this rather gossipy non-biography of celebrities he has met or spoken with.  <BR>(2) The gossip - sex, relationships, the inner thoughts of people as if he were a mind reader. <BR>(3) The name dropping...\\"Yehudi Menuhin...said to me\\"  \\"I received a dinner invitation (from Mrs. Horowitz)\\"  \\"the French tenor, Doda Conrad, once visited me...\\" Or, preposterously, after the author had played a Schumann piece Horowitz said it  sounded difficult and wondered aloud if he could learn it.  If he said that John Kerry is an expert on the hourly worker. Give me a break. <BR>(4) The cursory nod toward the music.  It was described well - beautiful, mesmerizing, brilliant, etc  - but it was mostly surface.  I was hoping for something more technical, something different.<BR>(5) The rather short biographical information.  Again, almost all surface.  <br />Is there a definitive biography of Horowitz worth reading? Regardless, not reading one is almost preferable to reading this stuff.	2004-02-07

The history of U.S coinage is one of the most interesting storie in the world and deserves a wider audience.  It also deserves a great book, a story to capture the imagination that would also capture the hearts of the readers.  Alas, this book is not that creature.  But it is a great guide for beginners or anyone interested in the notorious ins and outs (including trading, on-line dealers, honesty and prices) of coin collecting.  The allure of the hobby (sport?) is captured in his infectious passion and the humorous tales bring the reader back down to Earth.<br />By all means purchase his new book, THE 100 GREATEST U.S. COINS (co-authored with Garrett), a coffee table work that redefines the notion of presentation. It is a gorgeous tome, with history, prices and best of all, incredibly beautiful photographs of these noteworthy coins.

In this case, it is the extreme importance of salt as an empire-creating, nation-building, source of survival and yes, luxury.  It is hard to imagine a world without salt. Indeed, the reason salt is rarely discussed in history books today is due to its ubiquity.  If gold were as common as salt, it too would become a subject of relative unimportance.<br />Essentially, this is a presentation of salt from several angles, mostly historical.  There is some science and health for the interested layman, some helpful illustrations and charts.  Also the several old recipes are interesting in what they say and what they omit.   It is the history that I found fascinating, the rise and fall of companies and empires based on this single commodity.   A good, easy read.	2004-02-04

Why is there such an emphatic search for such items as Noah's Ark or the Walls of Jericho or the tomb of Jesus?  Islam, Buddhism, Judaism nor Hinduism does this and one must at some time ask why. And why the obsession with &quot;discovering Jesus&quot;?<br />This book is an attempt by the author to find the &quot;real&quot; Jesus. One would think that after 2,000 years of worshiping the man, he would be well known but the interest is greater today than ever. The Jesus Seminar with its scholars, archeologists, sociologists, linguists and historians have been trying to do the same thing for years.  The problem here is that the author uses the New Testament as the basis for his studies. In one way that is entirely logical - they are the only writings that exist about Jesus.  But one must assume that they are not only theologically but historically accurate in order to reach Yancey's conclusions. That means assuming that they were written for the purpose of history rather than theology and that has pretty well been discounted.  It's like debating a skeptic by quoting Scripture.  <br />We have a review of Christianity's past along with all the requisite apologies.  Then for some reason we veer into the subject of AIDS and world hunger, etc...  But the heart of the matter is what Yancey perceives as the &quot;real&quot; Jesus as found in the New Testament words attributed to him.  It should be noted that &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; is not a proper name and many of our ideas about him evolved slowly, emerging only after pitched battles between different groups. Christianity almost remained a small, Orthodox, Jewish sect that believed that Jeshua was a very human Messiah who had come to set up an Earthly Kingdom and would return soon.	2004-02-03

It appears that Ms. Pagels ideas have &quot;evolved&quot; on the subject of Gnosticism.  She now can venture that perhaps John was a Gnostic Gospel while so-called Gnostic works should be seen as more in line with traditional documents.<br />The author sets out on a task that has eluded many others: The discovery of the origins of Christianity, those first years when it was still a small sect of mainly Jews whose beliefs were totally at odds with those of later generations.  And what she found was surprising - this apparently orthodox religion was never pure nor simple not were its followers in agreement on beliefs.  Instead, the movement emerged from theological and cultural conflicts and the Jesus we now know is the outcome of that battle.<br />Her vehicles for time travel are the newly discovered Gospel of Thomas and the John, the fourth Gospel. The reason we have four and not five or six or seven Gospels is due to the battles of theology and history.  To the victors go the spoils. She points out that John itself veers radically away from the Synoptics.  <BR>Jesus becomes God, the Creator of the Universe, his  humanity only a veneer for divinity.  Jesus the man was of no importance except for fulfilling Old Testament prophecy.  <br />The many autobiographical references are cumbersome and get in the way of the story.  This is a book for the educated layman who does not want to get too deep, or too wild or too controversial.	2004-02-03

As a loyal follower, I can testify that if one follows the plan and guildelines presented in this book, it will be impossible not to lose weight.  <br />And once you start, you will never again buy a coke without thinking, uh oh - 45 carbs, or eat a biscuit, drink juice, etc without thinking the same thing.  The habit of lowfat eating has become ingrained in our system and it is with great joy that I can now fix an egg, bite off a hunk of cheese, grill a steak and eat butter without guilt.  <br />A general discussion of why the diet works is followed by the best feature of all - a listing of several foods from different groups in order of eat regularly, eat moderately and eat sparingly.  A series of recipes is also included and many of these are quite tasteful.   So cut out the fries, drop the buns, cut back on the skim milk, substitute the ice cream and eat.	2004-02-01

I read this book some thirty years ago and reread it again recently just to see if it still &quot;rang true&quot; and if the same things that I liked and disliked the first time were still there.<br />I am glad to report that the story still is a powerful one - ignore the politics if you must.  The handling of the many relationships, the uniqueness of the characters, the totally unconventional love story, the tragic hero  - it was all still there.  Also, the same things I disliked were present - the lack of more female characters, the dryness of Roark, his wooden speeches...indeed, his presence is like a shadow. And just as the REAL hero in ATLAS was the very human Hank, the real central character in this book is the very human Wynand.  The portrait of this man is still - in my opinion - one of the best insights into the psyche of a complex, would-be-great individual I have ever read. <br />Perhaps the fact that Wynand was so &quot;like us&quot; and not on some stellar plane or residing on a lower rung of hell makes him such a likeably character.  The writing is deft, brilliant at times, turgid occasionally.  The arguments against collectivism still ring true.  The basis of collectivism is that the State, through force, attempts to create equality by distributing material and intellectual wealth from those who have it to those who don't.  The fact that the given wealth is unearned is apparently not important.  <br />And although it's been done without success many times, it will be tried again and again for one reason:  Those who contribute the most are fewer in number than those who simply &quot;go along for the ride&quot;.  Good book with some banal parts - great story and great blend of science, business and art.	2004-01-30

That little jewel has two meanings: (1) The incorrect use of a word similar in spelling or pronunciation to another... cinammon for synomym&quot;  or (2) the use of euphemism with a pregnant pause. <br />The sections are joys to peruse - architecture, divided into such categories as Native American, windmills, etc.  Police, sailing, sports, religion, sports, biology, cosmology - you name it and there is a list of related words and definitions.  The book is a beauty in its own right - well written, large writing, arranged simply and orderly.  A real delight.	2004-01-25

It is the story of how a journalist evolved (quote unquote) from preppy reporter of all things conservative to a nobler, more humane man of the Left.  Most conversions of this sort occur on the spiritual realm accompanied by an epiphany or two.  Ideology is not a characteristic of America:  Eisenhower, Nixon, Clinton, JFK and Bush I were anything but rigid in their approach to governing. Reagan alone switched ideololgy (rather late in the game) but remained true to himself.  And that is the problem I have with Brock - he seems to have lost himself somewhere along the line.    <br />How can someone work, think and write one way yet suddenly decide that actually they supported the other side? Stranger still, this type of conversion is almost always Left to Right for some reason.  Then there are the claims (denied, debunked, unconfirmable) that serve to buttress his arguments.  <br />If David Brock has had a change of heart - more power to him.  But the few times I have seen him on the air since his book (he discusses his book each time) he has been unable to defend or explain his actions and when questioned lapses into confusion, stammering and/or obstinancy. He is caught in a Catch 22 - the Right derides him as a traitor, the Left remains suspicious of his past.  <br />The most hilarious outcome is the 180 degree change of heart among the talking heads.  NPR types who once assigned him to a lower rung of Hell are suddenly all agog over his revelations. Conservative commentators who once hawked his books now say he is not to be trusted.  Welcome to life in America.	2004-01-25

We've all heard it, read about it, thought about it and talked about it but have we written about it?  Did that Texan, the former Senator and then vice-president, use his spare time to meet, plan and implement the assassination of the President while in his home state? Yessiree!! And if you don't believe it you are are obviously out of the loop and not at all familiar with a host of &quot;stunning revelations&quot;. <br />These types of &quot;investigatory&quot; (and I use the term loosely) tales were once the sole province of the militia types but now the Left has gotten into the act spinning out lunacies that make prior theories sound tame.  (Newest:  Israel is using a new &quot;mini-nuke&quot; to blow up targets around the world (Twin Towers/Bali/Nairobi) then blame it on terrorists.) But back to LBJ as hitman.<br />Books like this, read without context, sometimes seem to make a little sense since one does not have to consider prior investigations, volumnious evidence to the contrary and intense research.  But this one takes unconnected - or even normal - events along with faint smidgins of &quot;possible&quot; evidence and draws conclusions that only charitably be called &quot;strange&quot;. The single fingerprint, the alleged contacts, the &quot;time line&quot; and all the other &quot;evidence&quot; would not be allowed by any judge in America.  <br />Worse, it appears that the primary reason for the book was to  prop up the fading image of JFK as a &quot;great&quot; President when he was anything but.  He falls in stature with each new revelation concerning his political and personal shenanigans/deals.  If you're naming names and discussing possible reasons why not include RFK, Nixon (suggested), Bush (absurdly and tragically suggested),  Hoover (another try), Krushchev (yep), the &quot;CIA&quot;, Mafia, Castro, steel owners, cabal of &quot;insiders&quot; or maybe Jackie herself who was tired of being ignored for bimbos.

Books	2	9	29	N	N	Graduates of Conspiracy University	Why are some people seemingly obsessed with viewing the world through a Matrix-like lens?  Reality is actually a deep, dark mystery if we would only sit up and take notice. These modern Gnostics have their own rules - discarding texts they don't like, elevating obscure scribblings to Holy writ, developing a new theory of history based on multi-age conspiracies. The only problem with this approach is that all historians, theologians, archeologists, and other professionals must be discarded and discounted.<br />Nowhere is this more true that in studies on the origins of   Christianity.  Perhaps this is because it is the only major religion that attempts to validate its claims through non-theological means, i.e. archeology.  The particular subject of the Knights Templar, Mary Magdalene, Jesus and his offspring, his &quot;real&quot; purpose and mission, the Shroud of Turin, etc has become a cottage industry, churning out speculative &quot;studies&quot; that are greeted with the approbation they deserve.  Sometimes it appear in fictional format (&quot;The DaVinci Code&quot;) but more often as a non-fiction treatise with wildly differing claims (&quot;The Sacred Mushroom&quot; vs &quot;The Passover Plot&quot;).<br />&quot;The Messianic Legacy&quot;, read without context, is a rambling but coherent argument. The operative word, though, is &quot;context&quot;. Accepting Baigent means discounting Jesus Seminar (searching for the historical Jesus), authors Robin Lane Fox, A.G Wells and other international scholars - they're all wrong.  Baigent would say they are not asking the right question / thinking outside the box.  But it is clear that at some point in the first century a group of Jews began to think of this Orthodox rabbi as someone special but specifically meant for them.<br />The lack of absence supporting the various claims to kinship is deafening. The fact that James, his brother, allegedly led the group after the death of Jesus confirms the customs of the day. Likethe X-Files, the truth is out there (but only the brave dare inquire) and the mythology is real (but bad guys - Mossad, CIA, Catholic Church) suppress it. The conspiritorial silence is to a degree not seen before or since.  The author would better devote his time to debunking the ridiculous claims of others of his ilk.	2004-01-24

Of the world's great religions, Christianity alone strives to justify its claims by resorting to non-religious means. In this case, we are faced with an old cloth, the so-called Shroud of Turin which purportedly carries the image of Jesus (seen only through X-ray).  The story of the scientific team, how it formed, its purpose and various members was well-written.  The internal battles, disagreements and give and take were well documented.  <br />But the meat of the book was the plethora of scientific tests run to determine both composition of the cloth and substances trapped in its strands, particularly those checking for the absence or presence of blood or items from that part of the world. (The blood expert, Walter McCrone, subsequently written an article, expanded to a book, claiming that the substance was not blood but vermillion.) <br />The team effort was both laudatory and admirable although some of its findings were later contradicted by a carbon-dating of circa 1300 A.D. (exactly the date claimed by many skeptics). The author, though religious, is at all times scrupously fair and neutral, open-minded and patient.  It is not the final judgement that is questionable - someone was crucified and it cannot be determined how the marks were made.  It is applying such claims to Gospels that were written as fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy and not as historical events. It is becoming increasingly clear that Jesus thought of himself first and foremost as a Jew.<br />The fact that the central claim in the New Testament (Jesus would return soon) never materialized forced revisions of Mark to account for this failure.  This casts a shadow over the stories contained, in particular the Passion stories in which the events were so contradictory.  Maybe the real answer to the Shroud of Turin is that we will never know and belief in Jesus as the savior of the world will always be a matter of faith.	2004-01-24

But he has become  somewhat  redundant, seemingly raising arguments or reviewing ideas introduced in previous works.<br />Crossan continues to look for something he admits he cannot find - historical evidence for the person of Jesus and the early Jewish followers who first believed in him. Since there is no concrete evidence (the Gospels are not historical) he attempts to reconstruct an original view from two sources: <BR>(1) the social and anthropological conditions of the time and (2) the events and institutions that emerged from this hidden time.  It's is as if there were a nuclear holocaust and 1000 years lated one investigates the origins of flight by studying first the science of the early 20th century and then the wreckage of air craft from the 22nd century. Some conclusions can be reached using these methods.  Communion can be seen as an evolution of an ancient Seder meal to a commemorative dinner to a lusty community meal before it was institutionalized into a sacrament reserved for the Church.<br />The work is difficult at spots - Crossan can be relentlessly tiring at time.  Perhaps the saddest thing about his unending toil on this project is that so few will be affected by what he says or discovers or conjectures.  Most will blindly &quot;go with faith&quot; without considering the foundations upon which it rests. And Crossan, who still somehwo calls himself a &quot;Christian&quot;, will continue plodding onward.	2004-01-23

By now, almost everyone is familiar with the faint 3-D image visible only in X-rays and with the ongoing battle over its authenticity.  The Vatican allowed a small sliver to be used for experimental purposes while putting out the word through various agencies that this was not the cloth that wrapped a Jew who lived and died 2,000 years ago. <br />What is confounding is that Ian Wilson also authored another work titled JESUS: THE EVIDENCE, in which he fairly succinctly comes to the conclusion that (1) the scriptures were written as religious - not historyical - documents, (2) that Jesus never thought of himself as the Messiah, (3) that the idea of a &quot;son&quot; of Jehova was not only unacceptable but blasphemous to observant Jews - only the pagans believe that Gods could father earthly children and (4) most important, that it is fairly obvious that Jesus did not rise from the dead on the &quot;third day&quot; (actually 36 hours).     <br />Saying all this, how can he assert that the Shroud was formed through unknown supernatural events?  In the book he examines the physical evidence, the anthropological and social history and the various suppositions, arguments and theories that have arisen as a result of various statements. THis is a good book but more explanation is needed in light of his earlier work.	2004-01-23

In doing so he repeats (more or less) what has been said for the past three hundred years from people who have taken the time to objectively study the origins of the most important faith in the world.<br />Many sections are weak from a technical point of view but none more so than the first on documents.  It is a breezy, strictly for the layman review of how the Gospels originated. (Robin Lane Fox's THE UNAUTHORIZED VERSION is an excellent source for this subject.)  Wilson opines on the existence of Jesus since no contemporary witnesses exist. He discusses the &quot;Jewish&quot; question, then why he was killed, the Resurrection, and last - and most important - how a lowly Jewish rabbi was transformed into the creator of the universe.<br />In the process, the original Christians (Orthodox Jews), were swept away by the growing tide of Gentile influence until the scriptures themselves became anti-Semitic tracts without being able to rid themselves of their Jewish roots. Lastly is the look at how a movement based on Jesus's teachings rapidly became one based on Jesus's life.  An excellent bibliography is included in the book.	2004-01-23

So too did Drury attain near perfection this one time yet never scaled the heights again.  Instead, he devolved into a good - but not great - series that turned redundant and boring.<br />This is the story of Brig, the honest Mormon Senator from Utah, and the dangerous Senator from Utah who will stop at nothing in his drive for power.  It is about the Senate body before the days of victory at all costs, the give and take.  It concerns the perogatives of a President and an appointment based on a lie. But most of all it is about Seab Cooley, the last of the old Southern Senators, the warhorse from South Carolina.  Of all the characters, he shines forth with his droopy expression, affected speech and his ferocious sense of right and wrong.  The scene where he discovers that his pursuit of the truth has cost the life of a friend is untouchable. The movie of the same name was good for its time but could never match the depths of emotions to which we are plunged.  I especially thought the changed ending was a travesty. <br />This is such a great book I have reread it at least five times.  By all means, order the hardback since I can testify that a paperback will not hold up to repeated use.	2004-01-23

It is not often that a story captivates the reader from the start but in this case that's the only words to describe it.

One wonders why she chose Ghengis Khan as a subject but regardless of the reasons, I am glad she undertook this thankless task.  Most Americans are unfamiliar with the great conqueror or are unaware that his empire was the largest empire in the history of the world.  <br />The remarkable thing is that Temujin, his real name, was born in the desert of Mongolia without privelege.  Over the years he transformed Mongol riders into killing machines and began an exapansion that for a time threatened to engulf the entire European-Asian landmass.  It is hard to generate empathy not to mention sympathy for such a character but he was a reflection of his times - ruthless, loyal, brave, resourceful.  <br />The novel begins when he is a child and follows his rise through the ranks by crafty politics, deal-making and fighting skill.  The story captures the mood, the scenery, the pulse of life within the inner circle of the leader.  The battles are detailed as are the geopolitical discussions.  The action is in turns exciting, tender and mesmerizing. When he died his empire was divided among his sons and eventually fell apart.  Today, less than 3 million Mongols eke out a subsistence living in the middle of Asia.	2004-01-19

I first encountered Pamela Sargent in the mesmerizing &quot;Shore of Women&quot; then went on to read the Venus Series and all her previous works. <br />This is one of her earliest but all the elements are present:  The interesting story, the time (not too distant future), the interplay among characters separating the wheat from the chaff, the logical progression of current trends.  The subject is particularly timely today with all the wild stories over cloning. (Idential twins are clones - should they be allowed?)

This book is not only about his life and deeds but his teachings and beliefs. Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a Lutheran German theologican  who struggled  as he interpreted his faith for a modern world.  He was an avowed ecumentalist, decrying \\"national\\" churches.  As such he traveled broadly, absorbing a variety of influences. <br />He faced a consumate magician of darkness, Adolph Hitler, who plunged the most educated nation in Europe into a maelstrom of destruction and depravity. More and more he was drawn to ultimate questions of good and evil.  More specifically, he began to inquire into the nature of evil and the response to that evil fomr a Christian perspective. He refused safe pastorships out of the country, electing to work from within.  <br />His theological writings, sermons and speeches were concerned with ecumencalism and living a Christian life in the world.  Through contacts with state officials he knew that Hitler was bound for war.  When the Jewish persecution began in earnest he began an internal debate that many Christians have had - what is the proper response to violence? Gandhi, who he admired, was able to protest only because he was dealing with a civilized nation.  Against a Stalin, Mao, Castro or Hitler he would not have rated even a footnote.<br />He was faced with three alternatives: Pacifism, joining the German Christians (state church), or resistance.  He chose the latter and paid the ultimate price.  His last sermon in prison, given at the request of the one communist/atheist in his Buchenwald cell, was from the texts \\"With His stripes we are healed\\" and \\"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ!  By his great mercy we have been born anew to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\\"<br />After the service his name was called.  He gave a last message to the bishop, \\"For me it is the end but also thebeginning\\". An eyewitness reports that before mounting the scaffold he knelt in fervent prayer and walked peacefully to the gallows where he was hung until dead.	2004-01-18

The Russian Revolution was unique in that it was not Russian but international from the beginning. Ideology itself rests on preset notions of right and wrong and the nature of people. The ideology accompanying the Revolution was based on sweeping assumptions that led to sweeping predictions and promises. But, since the assumptions were wrong, the promises never materialized -  a fact conventiently overlooked by partisans of Marxism.  <br />The author begins in Tsarist Russia, takes us through WWI in which Lenin was honing his skills as a propogandist.  (He made the claim that Russian armies were shattered whereas they won on 3 of the 4 fronts in the war.)  The Revoution itself is reviewed along with a more detailed look at Lenin who Wolfe calls the &quot;architect of 20th century totalitarianism.&quot;  By this he means two things:  Maintaining control through sheer force  both externally and internally and, more important, the state of continual revolutionary conflict against mythical or imagined enemies - Jews, the &quot;rich&quot;, Tsutsis, Christians... <br />Human beings cannot maintain such fervor for every - they desire normalcy.  The chapter, &quot;The Age of Diminishing Dictators&quot; discusses the decline in belief in ideology after Stalin.  The response to the Revolution when great things were not forthcoming was the same as Christianity's when Jesus failed to return - they looked to the future.  &quot;Some day&quot; we will overtake the West.  &quot;Soon&quot; we will have more wealth than the Unites States.  &quot;Your children&quot; will live in a worker's paradise.  <br />A wonderful chapter on Soviet historians is included which details the degree to which the state attempted to control every facet of human existence - telling people what was real and what was not be accepted (even if true).  Wolfe states that all totalitarian states impose a &quot;blackout&quot; on their peoples, denying them information from the outside world while feeding them constant propoganda.  With the advent of modern communications it became impossible to ration knowledge and worldwide communism came to an ignoble end.	2004-01-18

Each new work increasingly turned inward as we examine angst and guilt and sometimes regrets for doing the things that had to be done.  Pym is in a way the \\"perfect\\" (pardon the pun) Carre spy.  The Cold War is over and he can now reflect on his utterly amoral actions,  apparently coming to the conclusion that nothing matters, life is a cosmic joke and the normal emotional state is one of  resignation.  Poor Mary puts up with him (God knows why) and becomes the unidentified star of the book.<br />The writing and plot are meandering, lots of reminisces all done in a stream of consciousness mode.  Just reading the story is tiriing.  The novel epitomizes modern British literature with its countryside scenes, rural empty churches, cigarette-puffing disgruntled everymen and everywomen so devoid of any sign of enjoyment of life.

Mystery Science Theater 3000 - where are you?  <br />Meanwhile, high above earth, Christy (&quot;too pretty to be a scientist&quot;) and Logan (&quot;her man&quot;) Sam and Hammil and Rush run around wildly, facing more predicaments than Job but without conversations with the Almighty.  It all ends with Christy declaring she always wanted to &quot;have the first baby born on the moon&quot;.  Hand me some Tylenol...NOW!	2004-01-16

We know that only a small fraction of the works of Aristophanes, Euripides, Plato, Livy (the historian), Aristotle and other \\"greats\\" survived the ages.  The Gospel of Mark, which both Luke and Matthew tries to supplant, survived only because the splinter group that used it was located in the desert and the dryness increased longevity. <br />Thucydides recorded the first part of the Peloponnesian War and Xenophon presents witness to the last few years.  Remarkably, both men were participants and their history is based on first-hand knowledge of the events and people.  The city-states of Thebes, Athens and Sparta vied for supremacy with shifting allegiances and no clear winner.  The writing is good, very good when one considers the various replications and translations that have brought the work to this point.  <br />Xenophon introduces speeches and comments of participants and instead of just recording battles and events, he begins the process of writing a moral history - assigning blame, making choices on good and bad, presenting justifications and the reasons why certain people acted as they did.  THe author was one of the first of the new breed - those who sought to present human action that was not directed by the caprice of gods or nature.  As such he succeeded admirably.	2004-01-16

Her other works - 1914, THEY CALLED IT PASSCHENDAELE, THE ROSES OF NO MAN'S LAND - along with this one form a tetralogy of points of view.  WWI has long interested scholars in its possiblities and implications. By any measure, Germany, the strongest power, should have won. This would have taken care of Hitler, finessed Marxism and maintained the status quo of related royal rulers. Instead it was a prelude to a conflict that dwarfed the first war in every way imaginable.<br />The author provides us with testimony from witnesses and participants.  Therefore we visit battlefields, nursing homes and churches.  We hear the ribald military humor and experience the hell of war.  The social context - politics, manners, the mood and demeanor of the people - all of this is presented with humor, clarity and verve.  This is a testament to a time that ended a civilization that was the freest in the history of the world.  The liberal (classical, not modern) idea of education, civility, honor, duty and country would soon give way to darker and more \\"modern\\" themes.   These are hinted at throughout as even the common soldier realizes that the world is changed forever. Photographs, maps and drawings are included.	2004-01-16

What I got instead was a classic tale of the mean, old aliens (15 feet tall) landing on our beloved world, , enslaving mankind, our resistance and eventual victory (?). The problem I have with books of this sort is the utter stupidity and illogical actions of the aliens.  Why in the world would a race travel trillions of miles only to enslave poor, little us?  And why all the trickery and not-so-subtle movements?  Surely creatures this advanced could kill us all in a few minutes and have the planet to themselves.<br />Then there is the group of resisters.  It's a small world after all with this motley crew of multi-ethnic, multi-religious, multi-racial, multi-aged fighters - our own little UN of Earth folk. And despite the obvious, uh, disparity in skill level,  technology and oh, about a million years of civilization, our group ekes out a tie.  The ending ranks among one of the worst in modern fiction.  After this LONG, not so great buildup, the aliens suddenly decide one day to pack up and leave.  Seems they are lonely for the home world and decide that - hey, we spent a few trillion getting here and setting up so why not leave it all without rhyme or reason?  We are back where we started, wondering and wandering about our navels and the strange way the universe acts.  But we're gonna build a better world, yes-sirree!

He intended to write a factual history of the great leader but by necessity was forced to rely on word of mouth, old stories, past recollections and hardly any authoritative manuscripts.  <br />Considering what he had to work with, the outcome is simply amazing.  Like Thucydides, Herodotus and Livy, his goal was to write a factual work that was to have been definitive...and it was.  The campaigns are given much attention as well as the character of Alexander.  For a more scholarly and literary work I recommend Robin Lane Fox and his biography of Alexander - just stupendous.	2004-01-16

After centuries of persecution and having just experienced an attempted annihilation of its people, it was in no mood to compromise its safety.  It developed the Mossad, the greatest spy agency in history whose record of feats is unparalleled.<br />It all begins with politics.  France, long a supporter of the state, began its shift toward the Arab (and later, Palestinian) position in the 1960's. Israel had purchased a particular type of boat from France but De Gaulle refused to release the boat after it blew ashore. Thus an incredible plan was hatched to steal the ship (well, take what was theirs) and somehow return to home waters.  <br />The story of the background, the arrangements, the spies, the methods and the actual theft is better than fiction.  Needless to say, the import was more than &quot;stealing a ship&quot;.  It was about developing a gunboat with a special type of rocket that could skim the surface and inflict maximum damage.  The fruits of this labor was born out in the 1973 Yom Kippur War in which Israel took total control of the seas, entered Egyptian waters, sunk ships at will and prevented any Arab naval excursions. Great story.	2004-01-16

No, the story is not the same nor are the characters but it is the style, language and most of all, mood, that is reminiscent of the masterpiece.  Every chapter starts off with a &quot;thoght&quot;, the world they live in is an entirely new creation (no references or fakey copies of Earth) and it presents a &quot;new&quot; stage in human existence.<br />But despite its obvious good points, it was not quite the soaring, speculative work that I had hoped. Good writing, good plotting but not the best.  A good read.	2004-01-16

Up to his time natural disasters, national defeat and personal tragedies were blamed on the &quot;gods&quot;.  This remained true even when the writers themselves doubted the existence of those beings. <br />Thucydides took part in the famous war between Athens and Sparta and somehow made the decision to  - for the first time - write a factual historical record of the events instead of using legends and tales.  He conducted interviews, traveled for first-hand investigation and laid out not only the war but the political and social conditions that surrounded the event.  <BR>If one were to judge the work based on the literary quality of the content it would be difficult to award the five stars.  But the translator has made the best of an old style of writing that is detailed, pedantic and remorseless with the facts and consequences of mistakes.  It is a miracle - and a blessing -  that some anonymous scribe in a small room with candle and quill undertook the task of replicating his words for us almost 2,500 years later.	2004-01-16

In this case it was the \\"science\\" of cryogenics, now in an embryonic stage.  The author attmepts to be mesmerizing and grand but just ends up \\"very good\\".  The plot is simple -  a man dies and is frozen.  He awakens in a strange future (revived) and must face the Brave New World.  Actually, his getting acquainted with the current age is one of the best parts of the book.  He learns that death has been conquered through bioengineering, artificial intelligence and the general advancement of science.<br />The newspaper stories were at first interesting and not too bothersome to the flow of the plot.  But after a while they became tiresome, insipid and preachy. The ending falters slightly as it turns into worship for old age.  The future is so bright it seems unrealistic...but this IS science fiction.  Well worth the money.	2004-01-15

If it is the way an organism responds and adapts to its environment over long period of time then what is presented here does not make the cut.  Is a new phenomenon caused by bioengineering the same thing?<br />The science aside it is a good read.  It is similar in subject - but not plot - to COMMITTMENT HOUR (James Gardner) which casts a future Earth in which folks \\"decide\\" which sex they want to remain the rest of their lives.  Fast paced action in BREEDS but too many characters for my taste and the politicians and religious \\"leaders\\" were rather two-dimensional...no deep philosophy here over such an epic happening.

Titus Livius, a Roman writer, penned THE history of Rome consisting of 142 books...yet only 35 of these survived.  And of these 35 ten (Books 21 - 30) are devoted to the Carthaginian War.  What is truly remarkable about this work is its neutral tone, incredible detail and sense of momentous decisions.<br />Livy is writing about a past era and the debate still rages over whether he used first or second hand testimony to the events he describes. Several times throughout the series he makes statements such as &quot;this cannot be in doubt because XXXX was there and said that...&quot;  The background to war is here, the personalities are present, the reasons for the decisions on each side are here.  Descriptions of the battlefield, the evnironment and the fighting seem almost surreal.  Livy, unlike many modern historians, is not ideological and thus does not &quot;interpret&quot; events to conform with his personal views.  He reports the facts within the context of his magnum opus.	2004-01-15

Whether she was making a point, confronting a &quot;neutral&quot; interviewer or debating with the Left she was always passionate and polite. But this book is not well written.  It is more in the style and tone of a polemic.<br />Nobody needs to be told that the Clintons are political animals first, last and always. There is an element of smarminess, scheming and politics surrounding every public utterance.  Who can forget the tales of those closest to them - his obscenity-laced tirades every morning, her railing at unknown enemies, the politicizing of every event in the nation? One can safely state that no two people have had more (former) friends write bad things about them than this pair. <br />The mythology is still there - he was good for the Democratic Party (under his &quot;leadership&quot; they lost the House, Senate, most the governors, the Presidency), she was co-President (they did not talk over long periods of time) and that Clinton was some kind of ideologue on the Left (he was an opportunist who ruled <BR>according to polls).  The author is torn between reporting the outrages of the final days and the chance to hit at Hillary who she has consigned to a lower rung of Hell than Bill. This could have been an important book if handled differently but now it will be judged solely on one's ideological viewpoint - the Right will like it, the Left will despise it.	2004-01-15

We are the sum of our genes but we are much more than that - the moral animal.  We worry about what others think about us, about what we do, about right and wrong and evil and love and good and bad.<br />Wilson has made similar arguments in his excellent works and this book is a supporting cast member in the long drama of evolutionary science.  The book is not technical but it is extremely interesting - discussing such concepts as male, female, sex, family, groups, altruism - all with a focused eye and calm, measured vocabulary.   He looks at our reasons for doing what we do, why we like certain people and more importantly, why we dislike others and live life as we do.<br />One problem common to many books of this type is the almost worshipful homage to Darwin. His thoughts on many subjects are treated as Scripture at times and his life is studied for what he offers in other realms besides natural selection. While Darwin may have brought about a synthesis of scientific thought at the time, it is fair to say that technically he was surpassed long ago.  In the end, this is a book about the qualities that make us human and different than other animals on Earth.	2004-01-14

There are now so many and they are all so similar that seem to run together.  We have Civil War, WW1 and WWII series and prequels and sequels and sequels to the previous sequels, ad nauseum, ad infiniturm. You think, My God, won't this thing ever end?   But this time (most likely due to the presence of a helping hand) the writing is more crisp, the plot more lively, the characters MUCH more real.<br />The prose does not wander nor wonder as is the usual case.  A contemporary woman stares at a statue of Roman gods and wakes up in Rome.  The daily life, struggles, trials and tribulations are played out before the reader.  We see Rome through the eyes of the misplaced 20th century woman who, in the end, surprises the Emperor with her knowledge of writing.  It's rather silly that she speaks Latin,  especially since 90% of Romans spoke Greek at the time - the lingua of the masses.  But this is a fictional story and we should give some literary license. <br />The love affair - always total disasters in Turtledove's hands - this time is charming and rather innocent. Her adjustment to Roman life (she operates a restaurant) is superficially easy but again that allows for a good story.  It is only too bad that Turtledove did not ask for help on his numerous other works.	2004-01-13

One would think that Turtledove (or the publishing house) would know when enough is enough but no, it just goes on and on until it teeters on its own bulk.  I'm not sure where this \\"V\\"-like story came from (probably \\"V\\") but it was a good idea at the time. By now, though, the writing is past sloppy - it is sterile, totally predictable, almost as if he penned the work while in the doctor's waiting room or stopped at a red light. The idea of deep writing or a sense of wonder or a challenge to the reader (besides getting throught the thing) is laughable.<br />Once again, it is the utterly impossible and improbable - two distinct features of Turtledove's works - that make for such a poor \\"conclusion\\".  The first problem is one present from the start:  A race capable of crossing interstellar space has to choose sides in WWII in order to gain a foothold. The scientific advance of such aliens would be so dramatic as to render our technology obsolete, PARTICULARLY at WWII levels.   <br />The second feature is one of my pet peeves - despite a complete change in circumstances the same leaders emerge with the same qualities.  There is Hitler, Mao, Stalin, Churchill, Roosevelt, etc...all doing the things they did in the \\"real\\" world.  And that race of lizards - what gives?  They have to be part of a space opera, \\"Dumb and Dumber\\".  Why should any alien race feel psychologically close to one group of humans over another and why should they require any help?  In the end it is just a big mess but never fear - a sequel to the sequel to the sequel will be out soon.	2004-01-13

But as other elements were introduced into the mix (Greek, Pagan, Roman, Egyptian) the thrust of the movement changed radically.  It was no longer an offshoot Jewish sect about what Jesus taught or preached or even thought; it became a new religion based on who Jesus was and what his life and death signified ]  That there could be so man interpretations of Jesus is evident in the Gospels with the tension between the ethical teacher and the eschatolgical savior of mankind.  By the time Christianity had become the state religion (after 300 years only 10% of the population had converted to Christianity), the ethical and moral aspects had been discarded.  The only question now was what was the nature of Jesus/Christ and this was to be a political decision by the &#34;big boys&#34;.   Here is the riveting story of a plain bishop who thought, quite sensibly that the Son could not be equal to the Father.  After all, Jesus was quite clear that the Father was greater than he.  It is the story of the formal approval of the divinity of not just the risen Christ but Jesus the Jew.  It is the story of orthodoxy and the regimentation of thought.  The idea of a Trinity was resolved and this had larger portents - the later decision by Arab monotheists to reject Christianity based on its three gods in one approach with a resulting new religion, Islam. But we are getting ahead of ourselves.  Constantine, the newly sympathetic emperor (baptized only on his death bed), called a synod to resolve these issues once and for all.  And despite his own philosophical leanings toward the Arian &#34;heresy&#34; he sided - for political purposes - with those who said the Son and the Father were equal and one.  Great book with much research and thought.	2004-01-12

The writing seems more focused, the characters seem more &quot;real&quot; and the scientific explanations are as compelling and literate as ever.<br />McDevitt's specialty is first contact and that is what this is all about.

McDevitt is not at his best when not in space.  This book, though, is very, very similar to the \\"Hutch\\" series in many ways.<br />Both works contain strong women; both works involve exploration of an unknown area; both involve science and both touch on the meaning of humanity, civilization and the future.  The \\"eye\\" was a good touch but the book seemed to meander while the characters failed to grow.  McDevitt is a rationalist whose characters reflect his own philosophical outlook.  For this reason, we never have mass murderers or people going berserk and shooting everyone in range. No, his characters have purpose and plans - not totally realistic but certainly better than the nihilism that seems so prevalent in much of the \\"literature\\" published these days. The ending was particularly weak, especially when compared to the high hopes at the beginning.	2004-01-12

Jack McDevitt writes with the flair of a scientist.  His novels deal with humans and our exploration and encounters with other alien lifeforms.  He paints on a broad canvas with large strokes and this almost magisterial presentation covers up a few faults, both of which are common to many writers.<br />By far the worst error is the use of too many characters.  It is not that they are not interesting but the abundance of people (and having to follow their small storylines) gets in the way of the &quot;real&quot; story.  For example, in this book there are the group at the Academy, her family, three separate ships and the group that has landed on the planet.<br />Secondly, scientific progress is startling but society and politics seems static for 200 years. The many references to composers and authors of the 18th-20th century is just not realistic.  The reproduction of headlines is a really BAD idea -it approaches parody.<br />But that is not to say this is not an excellent read.  The writing is, of course, literate, no obscenities, knowledgable and always interesting.  The presentation of Hutch's saga, now with Tor and their daughter, was just the right touch, almost understated in tone.  The love story between the explorers was  another good point.  The Goompahs were too human-like but that is part of our anthropomorphic tendencies. The ending was, like much else, delivered at low key only with a touch of poetry.  The tie-in between Tor, Hutch's view on life, the alien's purpose for the Omega and art was a tour de force.	2004-01-12

Owen Paepke joins with Christopher Lasche (&quot;The True and Only Heaven&quot;)in exploring the concept of progress.  Lasche was concerned with the crass, hedonistic, individualistic, world without end amen aspects of modern progress.  Paepke's take is more limited, dealing mainly with the economic aspects of progress.  Both men see a new entity on the horizon - Lasche because it should arise, Paepke because it must arise.<br />Paepke is at his best when he is most detailed, explaining, for example, how even the introduction of fusion power will not substantially reduce the price of electricity (because it is already down 8-fold since 1925).  He feels that we are nearing limits in many areas - communication is instant, ergo, news and entertainment follow, travel from one continent to another is a matter of hours, productivity is at a historical high, the computer is nearing the end of what is physically possible. <br />But is he right?  How many times have the prophets of the end been proven wrong?  If historical trends continue, each of the areas he discusses will continue changing. Computers almost certainly will continue along the path to humanlike actions and responses, new methods for creating energy will be created, productivity will surpass today's totals.<br />But in another sense he is correct.  There are physical limits and once we have recognized these (an important point in his essay) then we can begin the adventure into biotechnology.  At this point he joins with Lasche in stating that material progress cannot continue unabated in the frenzied pace to which we are accustomed.  Lasche see a better educated, a more responsible, more civic-minded world.  Paepke sees the same thing only with transformed humans who live longer and better than ever before.  Both may - or should - be correct.	2004-01-03

Historians obtain much of their research from perusing original letters; there is a human touch in writing not present in email where my &quot;e&quot; looks just like your &quot;e&quot; and my &quot;Q&quot; is a clone of yours.  <br />The book of Reagan letters is an almost perfect example of understanding a man by reading his words in his own hand. The same can be said for Elisha Rhodes, a soldier from Rhode Island in the Civil War.  Reading these words penned around a campfire or in a tent or out in the fields gives a literate person a deep sense of sadness.  The richness of the language, the vocabulary and expressiveness, the descriptions and talks of morals and purpose and duty...in our hurried, wealthy lives it seems we have lost something precious, an ability to express ourselves in rational language.<br />One follows the trevails as they traipse from battle to battle. (Reading the list of battles this unit participated in inspires awe.)  The everyday details of a soldiers life are featured in startling clarity. His true character is reflected in his life after the war.  He married, went into business, organized various soldier's groups, was a Deacon at the Paxtuxet Baptist Church, became involved in civic duty and almost ran for governor.  He died &quot;at the age of 75...having spent his life in the service of his church, coutnry, state and fellow man.&quot;  They don't make them like that anymore.	2004-01-03

Hitler was obsessed with avoiding a two-front war as happened to Germany in WWI.   This time, though, the situation was reversed.  He sought to knock out the Western powers first before turning to the East.  France and England were the major worries at the moment.<br />Stalin also wanted a free hand as he sought to restore the USSR's border's to pre-Revolution range.  This naturally included a division of Poland and the absorption of part of Eastern Europe.   One is struck at the gall of these powers sitting at a map and drawing lines, dividing the civilized world into spheres of influece, knowing all the while that in the end, they will have to fight.<br />The authors record the pre-talks, the feelers, the struggles of the Western powers to stop this deal at any cost.  But Hitler was determined to press ahead and secure at least half of his border.  There are several mini-tales included that were affected by the treaty - the tragic dismemberment of Poland, the Russian rape of Finland, the beginning of a pattern embraced by both powers and continued by the USSR after the war:  The absurd claim that a government would ask either power to invade its territory in order to crush \\"warmongers\\". <br />Both nations shocked their supporters - Germans were puzzled as to why such an agreement was needed with its arch-enemy.  Leftists worldwide were struck dumb as their hero, Stalin, smiled and signed on the dotted line.  But there was nothing to fear.  As the fighting wore on and England refused to bow,  Hitler planned the final punch - knock the USSR out of the war and England would be forced to sue for peace.  It was almost a success but the supply lines and huge area became a quagmire and the lost retreat was in place. The treaty had served its purpose and like most treaties signed with totalitarian powers it remained in force as long as it was needed.	2004-01-03

Anyway, the brain not only thinks but talks and even sings, with the &quot;voice of an angel&quot;. Yes, I know this is a physical impossible without a mouth but hey, this is the space age and anything goes.<br />While exploring and practicing for the Met, Ms Brain (Helga) suddenly discovers Mr. Right who, unfortunately happens to be a &quot;real&quot; person who is &quot;really&quot; attached to his brain.  You'd  think with all her great powers she could simply invent the perfect mate and do bad things in cyberland.  But she wants the real McCoy and on the way battles a lot of bad guys.  What can you say?  It's like a combination of the worst of the original Star Treks (gorgeous aliens and cardboard rocks) and one of those &quot;books for the wellbred teenage young lady&quot;.

It appeared to be a historic account of the inexorable chain of events that, over time, have caused people in the West to lose belief in a supernatural power.  The writing is magisterial, always authoritative, scrupulously researched - but there are problems.<br />The opening remains the best: Thomas Hardy's poem and his angst and inner turmoil at the discovery that his faith had feet of clay. This, for him, was a cause of deep sorrow rather than anger or hatred.  The discussions of the English Enlightenment should be renamed &quot;Lives of Intellectuals&quot; for it is their yearnings and doubts and conjectures that he presents.  It is almost as if these were the sole inhabitants of the nation and their story mimics the nation as a whole.  <br />Wilson makes broad general statements, many of which are almost laughable...&quot;by this time everyone had dismissed belief&quot; or &quot;the Utilitarians were the ones responsible for social reform&quot;.  Or he was contradictory, first claiming that science caused people to lose belief in religion then commenting on the &quot;general English ignorance of Science.&quot;  As a matter of fact, at no time did the majority of Westerners lose their faith. Social reformers came from many areas but in particular the church with its drive to eliminate slavery throughout the world, and its efforts for animal and childrens rights.<br />One problem he alludes to repeatedly is &quot;When faith has been discarded, what takes its place?&quot;  For this, there is no answer.  One philosopher said,&quot;One replaces God only with another god.&quot;  We do not live in a Star Trek-like society, rigorously secular, humanity solemnly marching toward the goals of scientific understanding and peaceful exploration. In the case of Europe it appears that the alternative to God was politics, starting liberal, turning increasingly radical and coming to the twin scourges of mankind in the modern age - fascism and communism.  The State replaced God. Marxism is offered throughout the book as some sort of refuge for the weary but it established its own gods (Lenin, Marx, Engels).  Besides, the track record of totalitarianism in terms of sheer butchery makes Christian sins pale in comparison. <br />He concludes that those from the &quot;Enlightenment&quot; would be surprised as the resilience of religion in modern society. But it is a religion totally unlike that of last century.  Most educated Westerners accept evolution, the physical beginning of the universe, the age of the Earth and the origins of religion in myth.  More importantly, few accept Noah's Ark, Adam &amp; Eve, miracles, the virgin birth, angels or numerous other things that we have more or less quietly discarded.  Our faith, one could say, is in faith.	2004-01-02

The translation from the Italian is brilliant and the photographs, illustration and drawings really augment the fine text. We read about the start of modern science, how the great minds created experiments, what they thought, what they did and how their discoveries affected both them and future generations.  <br />This work and its companion (&quot;From X-Rays to Quarks&quot;) should be required reading for all high-school science students. They learn that science is not some theoretical exercise but involves working with the materials of the Earth.  One of the fortunate accidental consequences of science is that we have discovered that by using matter and energy in unique ways, our lives can be more abundant and easier.  <br />ALl the great names are here - Galileo, Newton, Faraday, Watts, Helmholtz.  More and more emphasis is given over to science and its meaning in society.  The philosophy of science and its practices are debated even as research and experimentation continue unabated.  The pace at which science advanced - from dropping balls from a tower to theorizing on the nature of matter and gravity itself - was contained within a relatively short period.  And, as we now see, that pace only increases in time.	2004-01-02

The author does something all of us think about at one time or another - quitting the desk job, grabbing the wife/girlfriend and headingn out to parts unknown for a while.  In this case, parts unknown was Alaska and Richard Leo was determined to stay.<br />Over the course of the book his girlfriend can't take it (don't blame her after listening to all their trials and tribulations) and he keeps his son.  The parts of the story dealing with the boy, his reactions to such an upbringing, their relationship are without a doubt the best in the book. As far as is known, he is still in the backwoods of Alaska living the life of a wilderness survivor.  More power to him.	2004-01-02

The second fact is what really got to me.  I am a voracious reader and the trash put out by so-called professional authors is unbelievable.  <br />Everyone knows the story so we'll skip that.  Needless to say the movie was a disaster with everyone in the theater laughing at every opportunity, not believing that Chevy Chase could play a serious part.  The folks who produced this film knew exactly what they wanted, though, and besides (their thinking) who cares about the .05% of the audience that actually read the book?

I expected something...different that what I found. The premise alone was enought to make me by the book.  I started it three times and had to almost force myself to continue.  The various vignettes seemed part of the story but the action did not proceed linearally,  The idea of desperately needing technology when it is not allowed sounded like a great plot yet the pace was too slow, the actions too disjointed to appreciate.  <br />Perhaps there was something else.  When action occurs in the far future it is imperative that the author use discretion in establishing a whole new society with new terms, names and mores.  Understanding and digesting the society was a task as big as following the story line.  This idea has great potential.	2004-01-02

It is the near future and Saudi Arabia has been building domes throughout the world which contain the &quot;Jitterbug&quot; virus.  Exposure leads to sterility, lunacy and death.  In 2005 the virus is released in Australia and spreads to Southeast Asia.  A demand is made that all countries succumb to the new Arab world.  Over a series of years large areas, even whole continents, are declared uninhabitable until just a few places remain unaffected by the virus.<br />The story takes place in the United States where Olson, a drifter, meets Gret, a callgirl of sorts.  They go to Orleans and become involved in a plot to overthrow the Arab masters who rule with a combination of electric mind control and special implants.  Through scheming with other Arabs who want to change the status quo, they manage to defeat the prince of the city and escape to start over again.<br />The explanation above cannot begin to describe what an experience this novel turned out to be.  Along with the story are appendices, a dictionary of terms (mostly Muslim) and a timeline detailing the Saudi takeover of the world.  In light of current problems, this book seems especially apt.	2004-01-02

It tells of scientists working for years on end in attempts to understand the universe and its workings.  Of course, we meet those geniuses that discovered a new aspect of reality or a long-sought explanation.<br />What is remarkable is how these great men and women used the work of each other to further their own endeavors.

After a brief review of the religions of Eurasia (from Turkey to Finland) we plunge in to the formative years of Christianity when the first step is taken toward ensuring an orthodoxy that would later be enforced with torture.  Origen and Augusting, the two greatest writers of the church, are discussed in this context.<br />Next is the story of Islam - or rather Muhammed - and how he became a warrior-ruler, leading his tribe to ever larger victories over Christendom.  The lonely years of Judaism (from the fall of the Roman Empire to late in the Middle Ages) is given a empathetic hearing before moving onto the church in the Middle Ages, the Reformation and Counter-Reformation.  Finally, a last look at Buddhism, the Tibetan way.  ALways informative and entertaining, provocative with his conclusions.	2004-01-02

Brooks looks into every aspect of life - religion, politics, sex, pleasure (especially pleasure), work, children, clothes...there is hardly any subject left untouched.   Yet, the text was slightly unorganized, seeming to blend the worst aspects of a self-help manual with the shortness of newspaper articles.  One must also remember that this was written during the Clinton era of abject greed/prosperity (take your pick depending on political persuasion) that seemed to have no end.	2004-01-02

These speak of the chaos, randomness and pointlessness of the Universe, implying that we can never know nor understand the whys of existence. This book is a poetical reverie on the wonder of existence. The so-called Anthropic Principle - the idea that any feature needed for life must exist because we exist - is used as a foundation for the book.  <br />From this principle one can study the requirements of life and begin to ask why.  Although A.N. Wilson has stated that we get in trouble the moment we ask &quot;Why&quot; that is the fate of mankind. These requirements are marvelous, sometimes incomprehensible.  For example, the universe as we know it has three dimension because (hearkening back to our principle) it must in order for us to exist.  The placement of our planet in the Solar System, the existence of a large moon, the tilt of the axis, the presence of water...all of these are required for the evolution of intelligent life and all must exist because sentient creatures developed on Earth.<br />The author states that &quot;Creation was Perfect&quot; or otherwise we would not be here.  The forces between atomic parts must be as perfect as those between galaxies.  For this reason, some have opted for &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; as an alternative to the Big Bang and its sheer randomeness.  This book is even cited as a proponent of that view despite the author's belief that life originated from non-life and his clear pronouncement on the matter: &quot;Science expands - rather than shrink - the mysteries.  A religious account...has the opposite effect.&quot;  What is true is that the CONDITIONS for life exist in the universe only because that was how things turned out.  This could be Universe 143,000 and the only one that established the conditions for life.  Great book.	2004-01-02

But no, he must historize everything, including the whole last thid of the book (really weak) where we review and empathize with just about every social cause and group on the planet.<br />Progress is interesting; those who criticize it use the very thing they decry to make their point. In one sense, progress does mean human enrichment. Now, to many folks this means more things.  To Lasch, it should mean a better life, better citizens, more responsibility.  I guess one could say it was the classic argument:  Quantity vs Quality. <br />It goes without saying that progress brings material wealth - it always has and always will.  Most of us take it for granted and even those who protested the &quot;excesses of capitalism&quot; at the WTO in Rome arrived by jet!  Lasch laments the loss of authority in our society and this is directly related to loss of civic participation. Only one generation previous, men and women considered such things as Masons, Rotary, Optimist, and Knights of Columbus important features in society.  But the silence from civic groups is deafening.<br />Lasch is particularly concerned about a new type of rampant individualism that has swept the nation (and the West).  It is of the kind that does what it wants to do regardless of how others are affected, it does not partake in communal discussion nor social gatherings, it is a god unto itself. Societal goals are sublimated to the pursuit of pure pleasure.  This condition is fatal for a society that prides itself on civic involvement and a long-standing ecumencalism in religion and politics.  In the end he asks the question. &quot;What is it all for?&quot; That is something each of us must answer.	2004-01-02

Amazon.com has a mistake in their review - it is not the third or final volume of the series; it is the second volume and is subtitled: &quot;From Gautama Buddha to the Triumph of Christianity.&quot; The final volume is subtitled: &quot;From Muhammed to the Age of Reforms&quot;. <br />This volume is the best of the three, dealing with such divergent religious ideas as Buddhism, Hinduism, other Eastern religions, Judaism and Christianity.  One should never forget that these three books are about religious ideas - not religion per se, and as such, the discussion is of a more theoretical nature.  Philosophical concerns bubble to the surface as we began to ask ourselves why we worshipped as we did.<br />A very clear explication and history of Eastern thought is thoroughly discussed.  New concepts are introduced as religious thought ranges from the morality of Chinese wise men to the pantheon of Hindu gods to the godless (but soon to be god) teachings of Buddha.  As he notes, Buddha never attempted to present his teachings with any kind of structure.  The various groupings and sayings were assembled after his death by his disciples.  The same can be said of Jesus.<br />In discussing Judaism he stresses its utter uniqueness in the belief in only one god, Yahweh.  This could be accomplished once the Israeli's forswore their primitive animism and saw God not as just a protector but as a Creator as well.  The beginnings of Christianity are an exciting read with the maelstrom of religious ideas encircling and thriving off one another - Mithraism, Gnosticism, Manichaenism, the Ebionites, Greek gods...and out of this mix, Christianity triumphed having borrowed something from each of these groups.	2004-01-02

The reality was that he was born a dirt poor peasant in Tsarist Russia, became somewhat of a Marxist, then broke the mold with his own brand of \\"distinctive\\" leadership.  <br />The book opens with the Politburo decision forcing his resignation after the Cuban Missle Crisis.  But there was more to it than that.  He never rose to the status of \\"world leader\\" and all that this term implies.  He was forever chained to his peasant roots which was demonstrated in his boorishness, bad manners, embarrasing diplomatic episodes and numerous \\"earthy\\" comments.  He did whatever it took to get the job done and in the USSR this by necessity involved force.  He has been called Stalin's henchman but the evidence is fuzzy.  <br />The research undertaken for this book was phenomenal.  What is especially compelling about this biography is the attention devoted to his early years, those formative ones that led him to support a brutal system that brought stark poverty to the masses.  He recognized at some point along the way that Marxism could only rule through force and he justified this by several means. His decision to denounce Stalin was both risky but also a stroke of political genius.  He received praise from Western intellectuals who were (of course) stunned at his brutal suppression of the Polish and Hungarian Revolutions and later the Cuban fiasco.<br />At some point in his life he had an almost childlikie faith in Marxism.  But after his visit to the United States where he witnessed the incredible bounty produced under a market system he began making modifications to the structure of communism (as indeed all Soviet leaders did at one time or another).He was the first Soviet leader to leave office without dying and his latter years were ones of quiet solitude.  <br />The book contains many photographs and pictures.

But this one borders on the ludicrous. A skull embedded with jewels is found. Someone decides to run a test and surprise, surprise it's about 75 million years old.  Of course this is not possible so we trek to the Amazon to find the answer and discover that this is some warning or signal (unsure which) about &quot;Timefall&quot;, when time ends. (In reality,  time would only cease when all matter vanished since time is a function of space...but let's not quibble.)<br />Joshua Green, our wannabe hero, visits strange Indian tribes in Brazil and manages to travel in time (fuzzy explanation). We see stars, and then get visions of a horrible future where the people he knows are quite differnt.  Then it's back in the jungle where we engage in a discussion on &quot;microscopic masses dense enough to locally warp space-time.&quot;  Yeehaw!!  Following that little lecture we traipse through the jungle to a cave, see skeletons of dinosaurs, witness further time distortions and ... but need I continue?<br />This has to be some of the most absurd &quot;scientific&quot; prose that has ever been penned.  It is surpassed in sheer awfulness by the preposterous plot and negative character development.  Why is it that such things as ESP, time travel and the like only happen in primitive places?  Avoid at all costs.	2004-01-01

He was with the Nazi movement early and attached his star to the mesmerizing leader who promised salvation and delivered destruction.  His own life is quite eventful and though he does not seem to be of the same ilk as Heydrich, Eichmann and Company, there is something rather sordid about dinner conversation centering on the destruction of neighboring nations and using their populace as slaves.<br />He rose to head the German airforce and for a few moments was a shining star.  One quickly learns that he was a megalomaniac, more interested in his own reputation and salvation than anything.  Like many people who are suddenly projected into star status (rappers, actors, athletes) he lost touch with reality.  His estate was transformed into a palacial kingdom,  his every whim obeyed. <br />The book is written in a friendly, approachable manner. It describes a man who was vain, passionate, funny, extremely charming and who possessed the manners of a gentleman. He loved animals more than people it seems. Toward the last he became a pathetic drug addict who, to the end, sought to justify his actions.  The parts on the Nuremburg trials were some of the best in the book. It shows how utterly captivating and charming he could appear while blithely dismissing such things as slave camps, torture and the systematic murder of millions of innocent people.  <br />That charm appeared to have worked with his American guard who, by all accounts, was taken with the man.  He managed to cheat the hangman by taking arsenic provided by the guard.  His end was nothing like he had imagined but then they rarely are.   Illustrations and photographs are provided.	2004-01-01

Not only was communism advancing in Asia, Africa and the Western Hemisphere but large segments of academia and the intellectual world semed intent on wounding the national psyche. Vandenberg, the hero of the novel, notes that the West was already defeated psychologicaly before it was defeated militarily.  The journal containing his mustings is a key element in the story. <br />The book is far more than resistance to a Soviet takeover.  In fact, resistance itself plays a small part of the book.  It is an exploration of those who choose not to give in.  There is a wonderful relationship between Vandenberg and his son, Kevin, who is retarded.  The internal battles that each person must make concerning their own course of action are constant.  This is not a view with rose-colored glasses.  There is no mass resistance because people have chosen to accomodate.  The ending is in doubt, lingering, somewhat depressing...a terrific tale of hope, loyalty and love.	2004-01-01

This has been done about, oh 1,000,000,000 times before so why not one more time?  Only let's show zero originality and make it as corny as possible.<br />For some reason, the nuclear war destroyed everything on the planet's surface but science kept advancing right ahead without a flicker.  Biotechnology has produced genetic wonders like, for example, perfect people.  The book is filled with terms so utterly hokey they invite ridicule...the Xi Mall, plooma patrol (yes, I'm serious), Creatorian Citizenship, Omicron Corridor, Pi Consort..this refuge must be under Athens.  <br />Society is quite different.  A new religion based on the Creator or the Creator's Creator is vogue.  A new caste system based on one's type of birth (or creation as the story would have it) guides everyone's actions.  The Perfect People (top dogs) control all and as such have a deep, dark secret that all the rest of the &quot;plain&quot; old people can't know. In the end, they do find out and the truth sets them free.  Yeah right.  The science (and I use the term loosely) was so pathetic that one stops trying to make sense of it all.  A terrible waste of money and time.	2004-01-01

He is the Joseph Campbell of religion - not myth.   This first volume was ably translated (from the French) into clear and direct English - a hallmark of his writing.  It is difficult to speak knowingly of neolithic religion because the evidence is largely circumstantial and evolutionary.  That is, we divine from our own religious present what must have existed prior to the forming of current ideas.<br />One of his main points is that peoples around the world, for whatever reason, seemed to be instinctually drawn toward the worship of something - an object, animal, human or unseen god or goddess. In this first volume he explores various cultures and their beliefs - the Mayas, Greeks, Iranians, neolithic man, Egypt, other Middle East groups...a dazzling array of cultures and societies.  As the imagination grew, so did belief in an unseen world.<br />Of particular interest is the section on ancient Israeli beliefs and the origins of Yahweh.  The chapters on religion in Greece were notable for their abundant detail.  Even in the most isolated areas, the same rites and beliefs emerged - the idea of sacrifice, the belief in another life, the battle of good vs evil, the idea of holy representatives and eventually the thought of eternal life.	2003-12-31

It's much easier to jot down a few (or many) recipes that describe the feelings, emotion and psychology of the food experience.  One advantage that food writing has over, say car writing or sports writing, is the multitude of functionality.  One can raise, prepare, buy, eat and savor food.  It is used for romance, for celebration, for friendship, bereavement or religious fulfillment.  In fact, to some it is almost a religious experience.<br />This is especially true of the author, Robert Capon, a priest in the Episcopal church.  He can be deep, funny, poignant or edifying.  These various essays touch on many subjects, all of them related one way or another to food.  His comments like, &quot;God may be simple but simplicity makes a bad god.&quot; are par for the course.<br />His strong likes (natural food, discipline, earnest preparation and freinds) and dislikes (fancy stoves, kitchen gadgets, easy recipes, strong cologne, arriving late) are fully detailed.  A compendium of recipes follow the essays.	2003-12-30

Shusaku Endo brings him to us devoid of our usual inclinations and prejudices.  Which of us, having been to church, can forget those pictures of Jesus in which he appears almost Scandinavian or a slightly rumpled European?  With an Eastern perspective, Endo can - in many ways - render a more balanced and more authentic saga.<br />This book is NOT about Christ, the supernatural being who was developed in the decades and centuries afterward.  This is, ultiamtely, a very human story of a man, his life and times.  Endo himself asks the question that so many recent critics and observers have pondered. Consider, the various books in the New Testament were written decades after the death of Jesus by people who never saw him. They were composed not as historical documents but as religious aids for the faithful.  Knowing all this, how can we ever know the historical Jesus?  <br />Endo asks the question then goes on to give this remarkable story of a remarkable life.  No deep theology or arguing about the nature of God or the mystery of the Trinity - just a simple moving story of a life.	2003-12-30

Crossan deals with sociological and theological subjects whereas Reed handles the archeological aspects. Crossan has been on a crusade for what he sees as the truth - namely that what we know of the historical Jesus and the first Church is unfavorably or untruly colored by most people's sole source of knowledge, the Bible.  <br />This book tries to carry both sides of the discussion forward but it does so unevenly.  Still, the idea was quite original and the discussions within are food for thought.  Both men are convinced that one cannot interpret Jesus without knowing his times and this involves physical as well as religious study.  How did Jesus's past influence his life?  What was the effect of Roman architecture on Jewish thought and more important, how did the material and social compositions shape their views? How were Jews affected by the various social movements that were rampant in those days?<br />There are, of course, many conjectures but almost much detailed reasoning and findings.  I found the flow a little uneven and sometimes the details ran to boredome but overall, a fine read.	2003-12-30

After that he became a famous star district attorney then went on to private practice where he became a star defense lawyer.  Then he became entrapped in that morrass which seems to call with a siren-like persuasion:  politics. There was that awful  book about JFK (the Warren Commission was right), then an angry defense of Clinton (Paula Jones, et al and 2000 where he wrote that Gore was robbed by the [Democratic] courts of Florida.<br />Thankfully, this was in an earlier incarnation (plain lawyer) where he takes an unthankful case that doesn't seem to have a prayer.  A murder at sea and the person on board is not guilty? The difficulty was compounded by the unwillingness of the defendent to &quot;tell all&quot;.  Despite this, he worked 100 hours/wk (once he had convinced himself of her innocence) and eventually was vindicated.<br />Great story, great writing.	2003-12-30

None of the writers had any idea their history or poetry or advice or simply, their tale, would one day be revered as the &quot;Word of God&quot;.  Bloom feels this is particularly true for the Book of J, the underpinnings of much of the Torah.  <br />He surmises - in a wild burst of conjecture - that a Hebrew woman (slightly over 40, mind you) penned much of the Torah, drawing together stories and generational sagas while adding her own peculiar twist to them.  Of course, all he can offer is circumstantial evidence - style of writing, oddity of current scripture, the particularly stunning biographies of the various characters, especially the vivid accounts of the many women... Tamar, Zipporah, Sarai, her famous handmaiden, and that woman of woman, Eve.  <br />The text is beautifully translated from the Hebrew by David Rosenberg who captures the essential poetry of the words that are inevitably lost in the English translation (although the King James version does its best to imbue the lines with an appropriate stateliness).  <br />This is a book on two levels. The first is the text itself and by this I mean both the text that has become known as the Torah and the various bits and pieces he selects as having come from a single transcriber/collector/author.  Just reading the words inspires allows us to wonder as we wander with this ancient band of people who had the imagination, faith and yes, audacity, to claim a special place in the heart of the creator of the Universe.  The second level is the story itself, the hunt for the clues, the interpretation and the startling thought humorous conclusion.	2003-12-30

What I liked best were the quirky plots and the still quirkier people. But quirky should not imply &quot;funny&quot; - these tales contain sadness, depth and heartbreak. &quot;Lindow Man&quot; is one of the best - an archeologist is studying a recovered body from the bogs, a prehistoric man, when he meets his future wife.  Upon marriage she becomes ill and dies.  He is drawn to the bog and attempts suicide only to choose life at the last moment. &quot;Pipistrel&quot; is also a tour de force.  A boy who has sonar abilities (like a bat) enters a cave and his mother goes in after him...eerie but satisfying.  <br />There is an art to writing short stories and make them both interesting and &quot;complete&quot;.  Richard Selzer has perfected this style of writing into an artform.  Highly recommended.	2003-12-30

Deconstructionism is yet another literary movement that accompanied the rise of feminist, ethnic, Marxist and liberation literature, movements that swept the academic world.  It is dangerous in its implications and startling in its conclusions.  Its founder, Paul de Man, taught literature at Yale.   <br />He hid a dirty secret for forty years:  He assisted the Nazis in their occupation of France. In deconstructionist fashion, the response to this news was that the Jews themselves were to blame and he was the victim.  Deconstructionists claim that the subject cannot be defined - it is a theory or method or even structure.  But among gthe disturbing elements are:  History is bunk (so we can't believe or learn anything), words control us (not the other way around), the critic is of more importance than the subject, absence is presence and most importantly, language, not knowledge, is true power.<br />The term itself derives from a call for the destruction of ontolgy, the study of the nature of being.  A close look at the advocates of deconstructionism reveals a fascist undertone throughout.  Not only was de Man a one-time supporter but so was Vladimir Sokolov (Yale), Heidegger (Germany), Blanchot (France) and Man's number one disciple, Jacque Derrida, the Algerian Frenchman. Derrida has defended de Man (as well as the others) arguing, in deconstructionist terms, that everything is theory yet nothing can be defined - even terms like good and bad.  The fact that this group identified with the far Left is indicative of the totalitarian nature of both movements. <br />The description of the politicalization of academia should be required reading for every tax payer or parent of a prospective college student.  This is an important, well-written brilliant study of a tragic event in our nation's history.  It should serve as a warning.	2003-12-29

Everyone is immediately drawn to this book because of its downhome familiarity and avoidance of central issues that would arise in a nuclear holocaust.  It doesn't really matter that the aftermath is a lot more hopeful than what would actually occur, or that people could really thrive and carry on after such a disaster.<br />What's important - and this is the essence of literary license - is that Frank has made this story so immediate and so gripping and (most important) imbued it with such hope that one forgets the inaccuracies and unrealistic optimism.  This is also a romance between the hero and his gal involving old girlfriend, another woman, a dead husband and all the accompanying sparks that necessarily fly.  It is rated a clear &quot;G&quot; and literally sings of a new Earth with all races and all peoples working hand in hand to rebuild.  A clear winner and one that is as popular with the young as it is the &quot;mature&quot;.	2003-12-29

The Mints, the family that has served as watchers for this hole in the ground, still maintain a close watch.  It is too much to give away the plot but needless to say it is all tied up in the end and involves primitive ritual, a casket and a long buried secret.

I wish they had stopped at the first movie, though, and had not gone on to two, three and the rotten four.  The quality declined in each succeeding release.  <br />The book is not quite as good as the movie and I believe that is the result of the tremendous sound score that added a touch of dread to every single scene.  As an aside, the Director's Cut was truer to the book.  It showed details of the alien spacecraft and it showed the captain and Brett captured and being used as a vessel for other creatures.  It did NOT include the best line of the entire book..the one where Ash suggests to the remaining crew that they try to communicate with the creature.

Books	3	2	7	N	N	Good physics, not so good metaphysicis	What is with scientists that they assume that just because they are experts in the hard sciences, they automatically qualify as experts in the social sciences?  Asimov is such a candidate...a prolific - if not brilliant or interesting - writer who was also a scientist.  His prose was much too dry for commerical success in any other genre, what with his limited character development and totally unemotional dialogue.  His importance lies in his role as instigator in the new sci-fi industry.<br />Asimov always sounded more the scientist than the novelist and this is not a bad thing.  This collection of essays is bound to please.  A host of &quot;big&quot; items are discussed - asteroids and near misses, time, light, atomic particles, space travel, the beginning and the end of human civilization.  Along the way he waxes prophetical, issuing dire warnings and, as it turned out, dismal predictions.  He seems to have envisioned something on the order of the web with its instant knowledge and vast communication elements.  But he totally missed the boat with his prediction that cities would disappear, progress would proceed evenly around the globe, work would be decentralized, understanding would expand, a world government would rule.<br />Asimov was a collectivist without apology, always hoping that mankind would discover the &quot;truth&quot; on their own, but always prepared to use the force of the State if the &quot;correct&quot; choice was not forthcoming. His many warnings on over-population seem antiquated today with the UN revising downward the future population of the planet for the 2nd time in five years. His ideas about universal education fail because they assume most people are as interested in ideas as he is.  Still, he was a visionary and rationalist who started a movement that has now become mainstream.	2003-12-27

I saw the movie on TV and thought it failed completely in presenting her revolutionary ideas. The movie centered (of course) on the odd affair between Rand and her first disciple, Nathaniel Brandon with both his wife's and Rand's husband knowledge and acceptance. <br />The book, though, goes into detail that the movie could not. It explains ideas and thoughts and though processess that no film could ever portray.  We read about a young refugee from Soviet Russia escaping to the one country that offered unlimited freedom.  There has always been disagreement over whether our attitudes are born with us or developed by life experiences.  In Rand's case, it appears she was born this way, displaying an odd, rampant individualism from an early age.<br />We see her struggles, her marriage to Frank, her first failures as an author before the one great break - THE FOUNTAINHEAD which is still, in my opinion, the best. (The portrayal of Gail is simply unsurpassable.)    We meet Nathaniel and the growing group of worshipers.  Unlike others, I do not entirely blame Rand for this reaction - she accepted what others offered, a very human emotion.  <br />At some point she decided that she wanted the young follower so they had an affair which degraded everyone involved.  During this time she wrote THE book, ATLAS SHRUGGED, and reveled in its success.  Surprisingly, despite her accent, appearance,   domineering personality and rejection by the intellecutal left she became a much coveted speaker, particularly for theoretical subjects.  Above all, she was a woman of ideas whose first concern was promulgating those ideas.  <br />She has been attacked because she was demanding, for an affair, for a discrepancy between her public ideas and her private life. All are true but her popularity rests on her so-called philosophy which is, in its essence, the slogan of REASON magazine...&quot;Free markets, free minds.&quot;  She espoused freedom and attacked collectivism in all its many variants - Naziism, Communism, Socialism, tribalism and religion. It was her espousal of capitalism and individualism that set her at odds with the &quot;progressive&quot; artistic world and, simultaneously, made her such a hit with &quot;ordinary&quot; people.

His workings and interaction with the many artists are captured, and this is especially important since this was a particularly vibrant and intellectually fertile time in the history of art.  His love for France and for all things French is expressed over and over.  His letters give us a glimpse into the \\"real\\" man, the artist who finally married his lover toward the end of their lives.

Not only does the author accompany is on an intriguing journey through time (chapters are arranged chronologically) but he provides a sort of social commentary as he travels. We begin with caves, not our first home but the first public meeting house.  Then on to Egypt, Greece, a wonderful aside for the Etruscans. Following the Romans he now elects a pathway through our Judeo-Christian heritage which is quite appropriate considering the interest in that area and the overwhelming influence those two cultures have had on modern Western society.<br />A quick look at the Shroud is followed by a glance at the last defenders of ancient Israel then on to the catacombs.  Several more well-known sites follow:  The Great Wall, Easter Island, the Mayas, Incas...and along the way he offers conjectures, nothing absolute nor didactic, just his personal thoughts based on years in the field.  The writing is at all times erudite, friendly and even poetical in parts.  A great read -	2003-12-27

On this planet Earthians (is that a word?) land and discover a race of tiny creatures, technologically developed.  This is the story of that meeting and is perhaps one of the five best scifi novels of that year.<br />In what is perhaps a parody or even a parable, we learn of the kerack civilization, its music, art and manners. Communication is accomplished through tiny robots are lowered to the surface and via VR, an astronaut explores the surface and the culture.  Our heroine, Merlene, a lower-class citizen of this world, is the vehicle by which we are introduced to this strange yet inviting world.  Like many races on Earth, society is based on a queen and workers, with all the accompanying niches of warrior, wizard children, etc.  <br />As the story progresses we slowly understand that warfare has been a way of life for these people but now has progressed to a point that is potentially all-consuming. We slowly realize that events are building toward something we can barely fathom: The denizens of the city are preparing a nuclear blasts through biological means.  This explosion destroys Camalor, Merlene's city, but in the process propogates genes into space.  <br />The ending is a tour de force.  One human elects to remain on the planet and Merlene has an epiphany and at last understands that she is to be the new leader, the queen without a city, a Jeremiah-like prophet for peace. She begins her journey with  the remaining human &quot;bot&quot; beseeching all those who hear her voice with a final plea, &quot;You be listening to the message o'Merlene. You be believing that message and you will be saved.&quot;  Priceless!!!	2003-12-27

Instead it is a sometimes witty treatise on English in all its glory.   If he wanted to write such a book it should have been called &quot;THE FUN OF ENGLISH&quot; or something to that effect.<br />The text is HUGE and spread out - a lot like those self-help books that one can zip through in about half an hour. Some of the topics were interesting but by and large this was a tale of modern English.	2003-12-27

But then again, all science involves searching for the unknown or the missing. Luis Alvarez and his son are both cosmologists of that old school - those who both theorize and journey beyond the walls of academia.  <br />It was an insight, something totally unforseen, that caused them to think of a &quot;death star&quot; that routinely visits the Earth bringing with it asteroids of death and destruction.  This new knowledge along with all the evidence of other, non-Nemesis destructive events makes one suddenly aware of how precious and fragile is our existence.  Through journeys to all parts of the globe, collecting samples, months of analysis, back to the field and back to the labs, writing, formulating....this was a task of momentous proportions.<br />Particularly difficult was the disclaim received when their theory was first proposed.  The scientific community is a jealous one and those announcing new or revisionist views are rarely applauded and even less accepted. When other scientists joined the fray and computer simulations began agreeing with the theory, attitudes began to change.  One particular problem was synthesizing the known extinctions with the alleged serial ones - and once this was done they were home free.  <br />Because we cannot &quot;see&quot; a Nemesis star, this will always have to be based on strong, circumstancial evidence (periodic mass extinctions, the layers of irridium, the computer-generated hypothese).  Great book and great writing.	2003-12-27

The entire thing is a MENSA member's dream come true - a work equally at home in the entertainment and education fields.  <br />This is not just one dreary problem after another.  Instead, Gardner offers commentary on subjects as far-ranging as time, molecules, chess, cards and electricity.  And always he manages to pause for a quick puzzle or two (or three).

I consider myself a scifi fantatic and have experienced a taste of it all - punk, hard, visionary, fantasy, time travel, end of world.  But in this one I could never really identify with the characters.  Perhaps it was their almost alien existence, so radically different from ours, that made the connection difficult.  <br />First of all, one had to wade through the new creatures - both biological and artificial.  There is the writing- cautious, certainly not lyrical or poetic.  Then there is the language, meant to be representative bof a future Earth but coming off  hokey.  Finally the plethora of new terms and abbreviations boggle the mind and are hurled at the reader so fast that simply absorbing and remembering them was a task unto itself. The (biological) beings here seem almost placid, curiously non-human in their incredible strangeness.  Maybe another read would have improved my evaluation but why should reading be a burden?	2003-12-27

Almost all deserve that coveted five star award (exception being TRUTH).  The current work is more than a history of various groups of peoples we conventiently call civilizations - culture would be apt. The originality of this work is its premise, namely that civilizations are to evaluated on their reaction to their environment.<br />It makes for interesting bed-fellows; one can group African and Arab desert tribes with the Lapps and Inuits.  Upon reflection it makes sense to view things this way.  The similarities among these various groups is amazing considering their geographical isolation and cultural diversity.  But each ecological niche - sand, mountains, oceans, jungles, grasslands, swamps - have the same problems and obstacles regardless of their geographical location - whether near the North Pole, in the Andes or in the steaming jungles of Southeast Asia.<br />Fernandez-Armesto's works tower over felllow journalists simply because they extend further, make bolder claims, ask the right questions.  Despite his interest and reverence for primitive peoples, he is not a multi-culturist who claims that every civilization is morally equal or that this kind of short, brutish life is preferable to our contented, abundant ones. He does ask for an attentive ear and an open mind for this lesson in history, language, food, customs and ideas.	2003-12-27

Lewis Thomas gives just the right touch, always keeping the writing at the educated layman's level.<br />Starting with an outdated plea for peace (the USSR was still semi-viable at this time) he touches on human senses - sight, smell, hearing, touch, language - and inserts a brilliant little chapter on his own Seven Modern Wonders.  Essays on altruism, music in all its splendored forms and the brain follow.  The last chapter is a requiem for life and the loss of life.	2003-12-26

James Trefil is, like many scientists, a wonderful writer who seeks to bring science to the masses.  He does not dumb down the material but instead presents it in a fresh context.<br />In this collection of essays, he tells us what he is thinking as he sits outside at sunset.  As such, we read about the color of the sky, time and calendars, sunspots, clouds and lightning. Interestingly, he retells current suppositions about lightning and the origin of life, namely that the former delivers an incredible amount of energy - enough to give life the kick it needed.

At some point I stopped trying to categorize it and decided to accept the thing as it was.  It is true that subjects seem to vary but a careful reading reveals an underlying unity.  <br />The essays are certainly not traditional but nevertheless they appeal and &quot;work&quot;.  It is culture and all its many facets that are explored in this book.  From art to architecture to poetry (great chapter on Dada) to symbols, evolution, technology in all its many variants - eclectic essays accompany each.  There are many diagrams, photographs, charts, etc that enhance the reader's pleasure.  Some insights into the acceleration of evolutionary change are quite readable.	2003-12-26

The topics covered are the ones he always covers but that does not distract from their excellence or interest.  There are discussions about life, evolution in all its variations, several storiettes on particular aspects of the biological kingdom - wasps, trees and urchins.<br />Once he leaves the scientific world and ventures into the cultural wars, the writing becomes murkier.  In his efforts to promote a one-size-fits-all human culture, he often ignores specific traits of subcultures.  In his belief on the inherent potential quality of all humans, he discounts (and continues to discount) findings that suggest some groups are smarter than others. He often selects easy targest for his disdain: Rural creationists, UFO nuts, believers in Big Foot, etc. where little effort is required to explain the absurdities of such groups.  <br />One point, perhaps the most salient one made in the entire book, is that nature and evolution limited similarity thereby bestowing on us a multitude of species rather than variations of just a few.  All in all, a good read.	2003-12-26

Pagels writes about a subject that few of us consider for longer that a few seconds.  And it is an important one in that it seems to counter everything most humans apparently seek - perfect order.<br />The subject is chaos, complexity and the realization that life cannot be compartmentalized, defined, divided into neat little sections - an idea to which we all adhere one way or another. The introduction of the computer has cast a new, enormous wrinkle into the mix.  For the first time we can simulate reality (indeed, life itself down to the cellular structure) and make predictions of complex phenomena.<br />He also espouses something quite original in his dicussion of that ancient brain vs mind question.  He believes that until the mind is understood on a PHYSICAL basis it is useless to make conjectures on mental or even philosophical bases.  Other subjects - consciousness, linear approaches, and even a historical analysis of the meaning of science - perhaps one of the best discussion in the entire book. His remarks on the great Karl Popper and how his works revolutionized the approach to the science world is worth the price of the book alone.<br />The last chapter on historical scientific creativity is a gem that should be required reading for every high school senior.<BR>Get this book now.	2003-12-26

Yes but with a little more aplomb and erudition that most in the field. There is not a &quot;we are doomed&quot; mood to this book and the author seems to prefer explication over prophecies of a machine world.<br />But a lot of what is covered is not only known but well-known. Who thinks that Big Blue is actually &quot;thinking&quot; in his various chess tournaments?  Norman talks endlessly about misconceptions concerning the computer world, beliefs held (he thinks) by a sizeable number of intelligent people.  It is because the PC so aptly simulates human behavior that we hold such views in the first place.<br />And while such subjects as art, music, learning, ritual, satire, and recognition of such subjective qualities as good, bad, beautiful, ugly, and appropriate are today solely human qualities, who knows at what point in the future that humans may program their machines to simulate some or all of the above?<BR>A majority of the book is spent explaining why this cannot happen.<br />A discussion of the difference in human associative brains and the mechanicsm of machine computation has been noted numerous times before.  In fact, it makes perfect sense that the two shall never meet.  Human thought is based on sensory perception with the real world - something a machine cannot partake in at the present.  We require vision, hearing, touching, tasting and smelling in order to formulate a world view. Until machines can develop a mechanism for simulating these experiences, we will experience only what smartly programmed machines are told to do.	2003-12-26

He is convinced that science and the study of reality reveals a Creator.  This book is both a historical and philosophical examination of the origins of modern science - an event that certainly had its beginnings in Christian Europe.  <br />Laki discusses the reasons why science as we know it did not evolve sooner; he also explains why science evolved when and where it did.  Several excellent points are made:  Chinese, Indian, Maya, Egyptian and Babylonians cultures arrested all developments toward a scientific structure. Once the very nature of science - the discovery of the Creator's universe - was accepted, the outlook toward science began changing and the modern world was created.<br />One can accept his historical and even his philosophical explanations without swallowing the theological ones.  Still, this is an erudite piece of writing deserving of more attention that it has received.	2003-12-26

These lectures, though, are probably not discussions of RNA, DNA, proteins and memory, random or leapfrog evolution or any of a number of worthy topics.<br />No, Mr. Pearce stays on the high ground and delivers such claptrap as \\"So the supra-implicated is all-power conceivable, the implicate is all-power manifesting, and the explicate is the contracted end-result so manifested.\\" (\\"Mind and Matter\\")  I, for one, do not have the slightest idea what he is talking about except that it sounds like mumbo-jumbo about physical vs mental vs conceptual, blah blah blah.<br />More hocus pocus on such subjects as sight, sound, day care,the hazards of television, raising kids for the future, learning, school, world peace.  He manages to state a few good points between all the squawking  - some children are not educable and this should be recognized, children should be raised by parents in their home, and we have the potential to affect evolution today through artificial means.  But then we hear again about how we use only a small portion of our brain (absurd - we use it all only at different times).  A discussion of the Bhagavad Gita about human potential and belonging brings these dreary essays to an appropriate ending.  Awful as it sounds!	2003-12-26

When you think about it, the very act itself is incredible - almost magical. Cells that were sensitive to light developed, over eons, into the amazing organ we call the &quot;eye&quot;. But how does the eye work, or perhaps more important, what are the mental and physical processes that allow us to view reality?<br />The first essay describes comprehension as a process, not a series of unrelated events.  He compare comprehension to a melody which is not simply a series of single notes but a sum, a quality.  Our consciousness involves much more that merely noting shape, color and size - it involves the way we associate those elements with the human experience.  <br />The author discusses many aspects of sight itself - constancy, detecting motion, depth, color, patterns and organization.  An excellent essay on art explains how we perceive a 3-D world from a 2-D image.  Finally, a chapter on geometric illusion and the point that we perceive what we think we perceive and this may not always be reality.	2003-12-23

Then he veers away into another direction and presents an essay on fire and heating homes which includes chimneys and heaters.   Following this is a discussion of the combustion engine, a chapter on great fires of the past and a final chapter on house fires.  This is more a social commentary on fire than a scientific study.

This particular book, ON SIZE AND LIFE, is not as technically challenging as some of those that succeeded it and in many ways that is a blessing.<br />For here is a subject that one thinks about only in passing - the shape and size of living objects.  We've all heard (and maybe even were taught) things like, &quot;If you could jump as high as a grasshopper could proportionally, you could spring 84 feet in the air&quot; or &quot;If you had the strength proportionally that an African Beatle has you could carry 500 pounds.&quot;  This book shows why those statements are not true.<br />We start with a chapter called &quot;The Natural History of Size&quot; in which he examines the evolution of size and notes that some species have grown (the horse) while others have shrunk (the cat family).  He observes that the larger the animal, the more complex it will be, something that affects morphology. Then he follows with a chapter on proportions that necessarily includes some mathematics.  Following that are essays on physical and biological dimensions with the observation that all animals live approximately 1.5 x 1,000,000,000 heartbeats except... man who should not live past 33.<br />Two more chapters deal with the specific properties of being large and small.  Finally an essay on why biological entities are the size they are.  The authors are a biologist and an engineer.	2003-12-23

But the purpose of the book was to explain the science of musical sounds and it does that rather well.  It manages to hit most the bases - pitch, frequency, perception, harmony, volume, beat, etc.  The best chapter was on sound reproduction, the worst on modern (quote unquote) music - particularly computer-generated &quot;music&quot; that reminds one of elementary school compositions.<br />I am reminded of the few times the Symphony has attempted a contemporary composition. Everyone stares as the conductor launches into a 15 minute explanation as to what the music is supposed to &quot;represent&quot;. Sorry, but something's off when you have to explain what you are playing. Illustrations, photographs, charts and graphs accompany the text and an appendix is included.	2003-12-23

The book is actually a chronological review of the exploration of the atom.  Starting with electricity and the discovery of the electron, we then go on to weighing the atoms to the discovery of the nucleus.  A truly fascinating observation of Einstein's work notes that the &quot;energy released by a moving body is larger than when at rest by an amount proportional to the square of its velocity&quot;..e=mc2 was originally expresses as m=e/c2.<br />After the nucleus we descend further into all the subatomic particles.

Forget what happened the first time with little Eve and stupid Adam, this is going to be different.  <br />But you know and I know that it's not different with violence, double crossing, mistaken identiry and rambling on about whether or not they're on another planet or say, Sumatra.  In the end it's Earth but it's another Earth (Go Figure).  Besides the narrator is knocked out and doesn't know if he's going to live or die.

This new saga reminds one of a children's tale in both style and simplicity of language.  But the story is original and even exhilirating at times.  The **** was entirely due to the development of the characters, none of whom are memorable or even likeable - too cartoonish.  The Ganymedes (the giants) seem more like cardboard cutouts of what aliens should be - not who they really are.  I guess I found them too anthropomorphic for my taste.

The society described is eerily similar to our own with some differences.<br />The travelers have adventures on several worlds and almost despair of ever finding one but at last they do. And, of course you know it's Earth.  It is early China and they have arrived to see Earth's first king.  The epilogue was such a quiet yet powerful summary.  Chinese scientists recorded a bright light in the sky in 1086.  It is, of course, the travelers's sun going Nova. And, you see, the Chinese astronomer who recorded this event in the imperial records is unaware that he is an ancestor of a union between Chinese and the aliens.<br />Terrific writing, mesmerizing in fact.

The book was highly praised in a review and although I would have never thought it possible, the writing transported one back to the Europe of the early 20th century.  In many aspects Freud was a typical bourgeois Jew - intellectual, deeply opinionated, haughty, wealthy, well-mannered and hard-working.<br />His group-breaking advances are explained in detail as well as his ideas on several modern practices he patented - therapy, the id, ego and superego, guilt, eroticism.  It was the latter on which he rested his claim for in his exploration of sexuality he thinks he has discovered the core of each of us.  We are, he states, sexual creatures and all our decisions and thought processes are geared around that fact.  <br />The triune history - Freud's, psychotherapy, Europe - combine to form a dazzling work in which the author shows a real empathy for his subject.  One of the best around.	2003-12-19

Anyway, he states that nothing can survive up here (so why is he there?) so they scurry back down but there's trouble in town.<br />It's rats - mean rats, hungry rats, diseased rats, radiated rats - in other words kickass creatures.  Trapped between radiation above and teeth below they persevere to the dreary end when someone announces with all the sincerity of a carnival barker, &quot;It isn't quite as bad as you think. The lunacy was stopped before everythig was destroyed..the separate powers realized their mistake.&quot;<br />I forgot the political talk: &quot;Who started it - Russia or the US?&quot;   &quot;China&quot;  (Yeah, right - she fooled both countries into bombing each other.)  Then almost as an afterthought, &quot;There isn't much of anything left.&quot; Please get me out of this dopey tale with some of the worst dialogue ever penned.	2003-12-19

The idea of using materials in such a way as to benefit daily life or perform task that we, as individuals, are unable to do is a giant step into the unknown. The author discusses tool-making in all its many facets. It is now considered very possible that tool-making contributed to an exapansion of brain possibilities but in fact made us into something different that the surrounding creatures with whom we fought and lived.<br />The idea of artificial means toward an end catapulted mankind and gave us control of our surroundings.  No longer were large beasts from out of our grasp.  The type and variation of the various stone blades is mind-boggling but the interpretation is just about as creative.  The sharing of this technology with other humans started a process of spreading knowledge that has continued up to this day.  <br />The author's hands-on experience was also an additional aid to her findings.  She is in no sense an &quot;ivory towered&quot; scholar but actively explores and examines the subjects in her book.  Best of all are her conjectures concerning the origins and more importantly, the &quot;why&quot; of technology.	2003-12-18

My own opinion is that things will not be nearly as pleasant as these type of novels make it appears.  <br />A classic conflict between good and bad, war and peace.

The authors continually fell into this mode as if that would make it somehow \\"literary\\".  The premise is my biggest problem.  To sum - it's the future and earth has 40 gazillion people who have squandered all the resources so mankind must find a new home. How fortuitous that one awaits (or so we hope) at our nearest star neighbor.  <br />First, population growth has been revised downward by the UN two times in the last ten years due to decreasing birth rates around the world.  Secondly, why would a society that creates starships not use artificial products instead of  \\"using the Earth's resouces\\".  If all the Earth's resources are used are people living on the magma core?  And the idea that salvation comes by traveling to another star (at a cost so great one could literally rebuild Earth) is a solution?  It is if the Earth is going to be destroyed but the task of starting over on a new world is so mind-boggling that it makes the Earth's problems seem petty.   <br />Good parts:  The VR machines (neat!), the discoveries, the resident evil and the ending.	2003-12-18

That afternoon one could peruse a copy on the Internet. What upset the powers that be was the conclusion that the familiar centers of anti-Semitist - Slavic regions and rightwing folks - had been displaced by a new force that has considerable staying power. <br />One of the most politically important developments lately is the alliance between Islamic radicals and the Left.  Several nations including France, Germany and the Netherlands have succumbed to internal Muslim pressure in the areas of policy and the future appears only more of the same. The EU report notes that both of these groups have contributed to the current wave of anti-Jewish feelings sweeping the continent. What started out as legitimate concern about the plight of Palestinians developed over time into an open advocacy of the Palestinian agenda which, if implemented, would mean the dissolution of the state of Israel.<br />The author assures us she is a feminist and a liberal.  As such, her recognition of long-familiar events seems somewhat delayed, as if they were crossing her landscape for the first time. How long has academia been advancing toward a monolithic radical world view?   How long has the European Left promoted the Arab cause?  How long have Arab governments actively supported the notion of Jewish genocide?  It's difficult retaining an ideology that embraces concern for the undertrodden while at the same time passionately embracing not only Israel's right to exist but her right to defend herself.  But this is the task the author has set for herself.<br />She includes a history of sorts that is mixed with occasional outrage and more than a little soul-searching.  It's difficult to hide the fact that Israel's support comes mainly from the right (in the US) while its former backers - the Left, academia, Europe - have turned their back and are leading the charge against &quot;Zionism&quot;.  <br />And what is the solution? The answer is reminiscent of comments by the talking heads post 9-11 on the &quot;real&quot; reasons behind the attack.  We read all the buzz words - education, health care, removal of violence, poverty, etc.  But these are insurmountable problems without freedom of expression and a change in outlook.  Think of the interminable African food disasters and the one-time solutions that fail to address the central problems. <br />Missing from the discussion is the observation that the Middle East is not as bad off as many areas in Africa and Asia but terrorism hails primarily from this area.  It is not true that all Muslims are terrorists but it is true that almost all terrorists today are Muslims.  What is most disturbing is that  academia and other &quot;progressive&quot; voices have alligned themselves with the most regressive elements on the planet.  And those for whom they advocate would be be the first to deny them the freedom they possess in the West...and in Israel. This book offers admirable history and analysis but ultimately fails to deliver more than pablum.	2003-12-12

Bush and the Southern Takeover of American Politics	Books	2	8	17	N	N	Intellectual exercises in bigotry	Which is worse - pointing out the alleged prejudices of people or engaging in your own bigotry under the mask of \\"analysis\\"?   That is the $64,000 question (an expression I am sure the author will find somehow offensive).  The few times the book stops its incessant editorialing (reminiscent of NPR and FOX) it makes for interesting reading, particularly for those with no knowledge of the region.  And guess what?  Texas is not New York; it holds a host of views that appear strange to those of the intellectual, academic persuasion.<br />Lind's writing has all the finesse of a sledge hammer as he  blithely dismisses a whole region for its beliefs. The attempt  to explain why only Southerners can be elected President falls short of the mark and sounds not only hollow but phony.  In the ten elections since JFK, we've elected Southerners six times, Westerners four times - not one person from the Midwest or East. No amount of flim-flam explains this fact away.  <br />The inferences are also stretching...one is influenced by the environment but Anne Richards, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Al Gore and LBJ hail from the same background as George Bush, Tom Delay and Trent Lott. True, they modify their stands (or as Gore did, reverse themselves entirely) when faced with a national audience but why knock the GOP when Democrats have sought this region for their own candidate?<br />No, what I suspect is the REAL force behind this agitprop is the recognition and reaction of the loss of power from traditional locales - New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan.  These areas are depopulating, losing political clout and with that theh ability to set a more liberal ideology. The same trend can be observed in the media with \\"traditional\\" outlets on a downhill slide to more conservative upstarts. <br />I would like to perform a vivisection on each \\"bad\\" view that the author mentioned, but will suffice to mention that Bush's support for Mideast democracy and backing of theonly free state in the region serves as the perfect counterpoint to the author's support for thugery, dictatorship and dismemberment of the Israeli state.	2003-12-12

Anti-Semitism is a deep-seated reaction for whatever cause (religion, politics, race) and the intensity has risen and fallen, but it is always lurking in the European background. The old notion of Eastern European prejudice, while still valid, has been overtaken by new forces only slightly less subtle.<br />This book is a perfect example of the latter - a situation recently documented by the EU in their as yet unreleased study on anti-Semitism.  It concluded that the force behind it was a  coalition of Leftists and Muslims united in hatred of Israel and the West and espousal of Arab dictatorships and radical Islam.  If the purpose of the book was to document the mistreatment of Palestinians it succeeded admirably but then that was not the purpose.  It was to focus blame on Israel when, as a matter of historical record, she is only the last in a long list of perpetrators that include Turks, Egyptians, Christians, Jordanians and Syrians.<br />A quick history suffices - After Israel declared independence she was immediately attacked by several Arab armies whom she defeated. Thousands of Palestinians elected to leave and the land originally set aside for a Palestinian state was taken over by Jordan and Egypt.  The next decades saw state-sponsored and religiously sponsored hate directed at Jews which served as a surefire rallying point by which dictators sought to relieve the misery of their own peoples.  <br />The two sides have diametrically opposite viewpoints concerning human and political rights. The creation of a Palestinian state would be a disaster of major proportions for other Arab leaders in that it would deny them a much-need escape valve. Who really believes that Sudanese or Pakistanis or Indonesians would be affected one way or another by a new state?  There is nothing so tragic or absurd as Western intellectuals joining forces with an established terrorist and his gang of thugs to pressure the one democratic state in the region.	2003-12-09

Two women, Mary and Rachel, attempt to maintain what they see as either the last remnant or the first stirrings of civilization - books.  They must live within a community of religious Fanatics, the Ark, who think that books are not only evil but blasphemous.  (Why anyone would call books blasphemous and then quote Scripture from a &quot;Book&quot; is a little...wacky, but forget that.)  <br />The novel is a look back at a life of long, quiet struggle with minor interruptions.  Mary meets Rachel, kindred spirits who are determined to reclaim a spark of humanity through learning and books.  The leader of the Ark agrees that Mary can be the teacher of the Ark children.  She pushes them to think, to challenge, to question.   She meets Luke, a member of the Ark, and becomes pregnant.  Rachel and she bury the books out of desperation, Rachel dies, her child dies, yet she perseveres and in the end manages to come to terms with her world and her hopes. <br />As in similar books, the survivors are rabid fundamentalists who reject teaching, intellect and even practical applications of science.  This is not only absurd it's totally unrealistic. After all, it is secular societies who today are the greatest enemies of freedom.  Still, it was a touching story that bears rereading every now and then.	2003-12-07

It is that but the ramifications of that site are stupendous, namely that life on Earth has undergone regular catasclysmic destruction.  The Burgess Shale is perhaps the most valuable scientific find of a century in what it proves and disproves.  <br />The shale itself dates from 530 million years ago and teems with an extraordinary variety of life - life that was almost terminated by a rock from space.  The important thing Gould determines is that if not for this near extinction, life would have developed in a completely different manner and humans - indeed vertebrates -would not be the dominant creatures.  <br />Must one conclude that our presence is a fluke or an accident? Those opting for a divine plan must surely question why their divinity went to all the trouble to create such an incredible variety of life only to have it destroyed.  All we can do is work with what we have.<br />The descriptions of the shale beings are incredibly interesting as is the discovery, loss and recovery of the site.  Then there is Marianne Collins and her magnificent interpretations of the weird inhabitants of the shales.  One must remember that most of these were crushed and smashed and had to be reconstructed not only physically but mentally.  The Shale asks questions about Evolutions such as how can new species form so rapidly when classic theory calls for long eons in development? Which, if any of the Shale traits survived the destruction?  In the end Gould attacks (for about the zillionth time) the standard evolutionary charts as not representative of the &quot;true&quot; status of beings with aphids on the bottom and humans at top.<br />But then history is written by the winners and though our lifespan has been short and may be shorter still, we are still the only creatures that recognize that face.  Perhaps that is why we design anthropomorthic charts and think in terms of low and high evolution.	2003-12-06

It is divided into two sections that the author describes as  reflecting two meanings of the title - the infinite quality of the universe and the infinite responsibility of mankind. The essays are erudite, entertaining, informative and more than anything (especially in the &quot;universe&quot; section) demonstrate that the nature of science and humanity's involvement in it is complex, sometimes contradictory and at times perplexing.  <br />Life is explored in all its variations - how it started, why it's complex, how it will end, what it means.  Then the second part falters a bit. The author can be forgiven some of his remarks due to the date of publication as he goes on about the (former) Soviet Union, peace, NATO, Star Wars, Nuclear Winter, etc.   <br />The problem with non-political types formulating policy is that over time the perception grows that Barbra Streisand is as knowledgable as Colin Powell or Freeman Dyson knows something that Madelaine Albright doesn't or that Jerry Falwell or Dr. Ruth or some college professor has the answer to the complex social problems of the day.<br />The peaceful manner in which the potentially explosive end of the Cold War was guided by those familiar with the situation is a rebuke to all the talking heads.  A good essay on &quot;Star Wars&quot; and its meaning and potential was followed by some out of the box speculation on ways of dealing with the Soviet State.  What was infuriating was the notion pushed by Dyson that scientists and intellectuals are peculiarly inclined toward peace.  Do farmers, steel workers, bankers, programmers and chefs desire a nuclear war?  Who created those weapons if not scientists?  He, like many, dreams of a Star Trek world of universal peace, an end to racial and religious strife and a focus on scientific and artistic achievment.  It sounds noble but in no way reflects ourevolutionary heritage.	2003-12-06

His genius is not in just expounding on the mechanism or the methodology of evolution but how it relates to human beings in the modern world.  In this short but readable work there are five essays dealing with mankind's beginnings, ancestry, traits, sex and whether a person is digital or analog (we are both - chemical and electric).<br />One subject he returns to again and again is the timeframe of evolutionary change.  Using non-technical language he discusses the evolution of the eye, the dance of honeybees, the purpose of purpose, good and bad traits.  <br />After starting at the beginning he concludes in the speculative future, reminding us of our place in the universe and the fact that we as a species have progressed until we are able to send forth probes into the depths of the heavens revealing who we are and more important, what we are.	2003-12-06

But Nigel Calder has made the whole thing a lot easier.<br />This is NOT one of those small books with large writing and illustrations every over page. It is condensed but not obtuse - no difficult equations or esoteric 11 dimensional theory. The author tackles two subjects - Einstein and his work.  Both are interesting to study but as time passes the focus will swing to the latter.<br />The book has chapters on almost every aspect of the theory - time, gravity, space, acceleration, light, energy, matter... It is almost too much to grasp but Calder does a fine job of organizing the material.  Good book.	2003-12-06

If anything, we have discovered that life and the Universe are more complex than we could imagine and though we can make sense of some it - and even recognize patterns and operations - we cannot boil down the mystery of creation to simple rules.<br />This same thing is particularly true when discussing evolution, one of the most controversial subjects around.  Even now, the topic is under review by scientists as they seek to refine the evolutionary model.  Are mutations the culprit, is it long eons of change or relatively short spurts in transformation? We can only surmise at this point and agree on a general theory.<br />Dozier's use of evolution involves more than simply biological metamorphosis - it entails the universe as a whole.  He goes from material to life to thought in a handy progression. He calls the codes that govern these the quantum, genetic and synaptic.  The writing seems amatuerish as we ramble from sonic sound to chaos to memory to &quot;using these tools to &quot;eliminate mental illness and use our brain to its full potential&quot; - Yee haw!... For the record, Dozier was general counsel to former Governor Brown of Kentucky.	2003-12-06

It seems to jump among several topics that may or may not have much relevance with one another.  It also switches from science to science fiction with an uneasy frequency, discussing neural networks then H.A.L. in 2001 or switching from literature to the lab.<br />The author explores humanity. She asks the right question, <BR>&quot;What does it mean to be human?&quot; and has essays on memory, consciousness, potential, learning and behavior as well as musings on the physical properties of the android. What I found missing were such concepts as good and evil, moral and immoral, right and wrong.  If androids become self-aware how will they view themselves in context with other creatures?<br />This is more an exploratory book of preliminary questions, more a survey of contemporary robotic efforts than an actual look at everyday companions.  The future is too hazy, the time too distant, the science too new to do much more than forecast and speculate.	2003-12-06

The first detailed investigation of the vanished empire began in the early 19th century and has continued unabated. The same questions are still asked today - where did they come from, how and more important, why did they settle in such inhospitable land, Why did they abandon their cities?<br />First, there is a discussion of theories suggesting a link between the old and new world. This is rejected...Egypt did not influence the Mayans - all ancient cultures built pyramidal structures due to their ease of construction. Like other early kingdoms, it was both a political and religious entity - a theocracy that became more elitist and authoritarian as time passed  Mayans excelled in many area but surprisingly, not the practical ones.   Their mathematics and time calculations were phenomenal, the art sophisticated, their astronomy advanced and the various theologies complex. But they did not make tools to chop trees, till the soil, plant or harvest crops.   <br />The empire passed through several phases then the people disappeared, the cities were abandoned.  Among the many theories that have been proposed, the author concluded upon the most likely - a long-time revolt by the peasants against the priestly class. Why would illiterate natives be impressed with great strides in astronomy, mathematics or time forecasting?  There is also the matter of the evolution of the religion to demand more and more sacrifices.  The exploration of the Well of Sacrifice in Chichen Itza revealed literally thousands of corpses slain to satisfy the blood-thirsty gods. At some point the lower classes revolted and the cities were emptied one by one.  Alas, we shall probably never know for sure.  This is a great book for the amateur, not at all technical, a very good introduction to the Mayans.	2003-12-01

This weekend vignette captures the essence of this remarkable woman - perhaps the most remarkable of the Middle Ages.  Ms. Kelly has obviously undertaken a labor of love with prodigious research, meticulous documentation and references to primary sources.  In many ways the scholarship evidenced here is the outstanding feature.  <br />The story is one that is almost familiar - we are in the time of the Crusades, the Normans have conquered England and the Plantagenets are in control.  It is simultaneously the story of the rebirth of Britain as an independent political entity.   The Aquitaine was a much desired territory with economic, military, religious and historical import.  But princess Eleanor did not marry to fuse or protect her kingdom.  She apparently possessed a quick, far-reaching mind and knew that a woman in her position could go far.  <br />She was a renaissance woman:  Devout (financing Crusades and traveling to the Holy Land), scheming and daring (divorced Louis for the up and coming Henry), politically astute and above all a power broker of the first degree.  She grew too powerful for Henry who kept her under a form of house arrest.  She then had intrigues with her son, Richard I (the Lion hearted) but finally became undisputed ruler of England in all but name.  Lastly she became involved in the affairs of her son John.<br />The story is more interesting that the writing which is pedantic at times, occasionally stilted and formal, sometimes almost obtuse in its language and references.  This is NOT a tale for the unknowing layman since it presumes a knowledge of the early Middle Ages.  Despite all this it is an incredible biography - perhaps the best around - of Eleanor.	2003-12-01

Even then one would have to reward an \\"11\\" for this magnificent tome.  I could not find a single flaw in the entire reading - character development and portrayal was realistic yet unforgettable, the setting mesmerizing (one is instantly transported back to the time of the Inquisition and the faith-filled, simple lives of the city dwellers) and the plot was perfect.  <br />I have read criticism that the tale was not realistic or made suppositions and assumptions that are not exactly correct in the historical sense.  But what one should remember is that this tale is an allegory, not a documentary. The fictional city is in Spain and the Inquisition is at its high point when a stranger appears.   He is intelligent, interesting, and friendly but an unbeliever.  He tells of a land in which belief is arbitrary and where one can change their religion - or choose to have no religion at all.  This is too much for Church officials for in their eyes murder, torture and lying can be forgiven but also blessed.   A trial of sorts is proposed.  <br />Now we have the second story and the joy is how the two are seemlessly weaved into one arc.  A child found among the wolves is being raised by nuns. She is not to be given any religious instruction and if she comes to a belief in a Supreme Being the visitor will be found guilty, otherwise he will be judged to be innocent. <br />The battle is not between atheist and believer. It is a civil war between two schools of thought within Catholicism - the plain folk and their local leaders and a grand inquisitor who employs \\"unusual\\" methods for \\"protecting the faith\\".  The wolf-girl finally is made to make a statement that can be interpreted as belief and Palindo, the visitor, is tortured to confession.  When he refuses to follow this up with another confession (which would then validate the previous \\"confession\\") he is sentenced to be burned alive at the stake.  A lowly follower trades all her material goods for a balm that will bring instant death upon being heated.  <br />The aftermath is a short but appealing denouement.  The bishop's assistant announces he cannot believe in a God that seeks obedience through torture.  The wolf-girl returns to her solitary mountain home but not before catching a glimpse of a vast naval armada from the foreign land streaming toward the city that burned its citizen.

In this interesting and at the same time informative work he continually offers multiple answers to questions.  Did we become human in Africa and then undertake the journey or did we develop independently?  How and why did they travel?  Why were the Neandertals so late in populating Europe despite its closeness.<br />The author is, if anything, open-minded, giving all sides to an argument. He beings with a discussion of the mythical \\"Eve\\" and who she might have been and where she might have been from. He then discusses the evolutionary aspects and the paleontological finings.  One interesting chapter concerned the populating of Asia.  The job is made all the more difficult because of the discovery of very ancient man in such places as China and Indonesia who were not homo sapiens.<br />A discussion of the peopling of the Americas follows with the obvious conclusion (based on dentistry) that Native Americans are descended from notheastern Asians.  the book contains several illustrations and charts that add to the story.	2003-12-01

Lindsay has to be one of the best kept secrets in modern American literature.  His stories are without exception deft, deep and dramatic and the characters are so utterly REAL - with hidden sorrows, unforgiven deeds and hosts of other problems.  Yet they all strive for love and completeness.<br />As usual the research complements the story.  I knew next to nothing about the business side of collecting drawings - or the drawing world in general for that matter. But the way he weaves this world with his &quot;other&quot; plot is superb.  His heroes (he is a man's writer) are uniformly suave, masculine, Thomas Crownes with angst.  Our apparently relaxed and successful collector is of course not what he appears but instead is a former spy.  <br />In a Ten Little Indians reference, all members of his team are being murdered one by one. He meets a beautiful woman who may or may not be all she seems and in the end there is an act of revenge that literally stuns.  Mara and Strand are the perfect couple in Lindsay's universe.  Teir sophistication, panache and verbal foreplay are the stuff of great movies and great novels.  A great read!	2003-11-26

This is the story of the rise of modern American capitalism with all of the accompanying charactersistcs we - and the rest of the world - normally associate with it.  There is the showmanship, the grand challenges and dares, the incredible ingenuity, the curious and hardworking genius and the freely accepted wild competition that has made this nation the economic powerhouse of all time.  <br />As Daniel Boorstin said, the salient feature of Western capitalism is the ability to create unneeded wants. After all, when you get down to it, the &quot;things&quot; in our lives only serve to better it from a previous state when those things were not available.  But this is the whole point (if I may digress).  We have things like air conditioners, refrigerators, heating pads and remote controls to add quality to our lives.  <br />The book starts at the beginning of the nation and the decision by the government to actively promote and protect inventors.  This decision had enormous consequences.  For if the inventor was free to work and reap the rewards of his effort this only increased the tidal wave of innovation that swept the country.  Museums, expositions, trade, the huckster, the precursers to the much-maligned marketing folks - all of these were essential elements of the system. Why did it matter that a new time-saving device existed if no one knew about it?  <br />Much detail was given to the invention of electric lights and how the rivalries between two men with similar claims would play out in the future, indeed set the tone for the future. For who can imagine GM without Ford, or Coca Cola without Pepsi, or Schick without Gillette?  Spreading the new product Gospel by sideshow evolved into the commercial system that exists today - the supermarket, the chain, E-bay, advertising, and the line of new products that continue to dazzle the world.<br />The book has some illustrations and the writing is informative as well as witty in parts.  Lindsay writes with a wry wit and seems to place a high value on irony.  Excellent book - get it now.	2003-11-24

Two stories procede at side by side, the former (from 1948) setting up the latter (in 1968) which references the first.  The religious experience of downtrodden peoples from Middle Europe was perfectly depicted - from their simple faith to their hope for a miraculous deliverence from the tyranny of communism. <br />By the time of the Spring Prague the nation was demoralized but had not surrendered its soul.  As in every country under Soviet tyranny, people expressed their desire to be free in hundreds of ways, one of which was revolution.  But the &quot;miracle&quot; of that spring was as elusive as the purported miracle from 20 years earlier. <br />What is particularly tragic is all the wasted time, effort and lives expended arguing about such an absurd philosophy as Marxism which, we should note, was hardest on the &quot;people&quot; to whom it gave lip service; its existence was made possible through the use of force.  By the end one understands that all the dialectics and theories and promises mean nothing when compared to individual freedom or in this case, the liberation of a whole society.	2003-11-23

This is NOT a book about alternate endings or a discussion of how the losing side could have won the battle.  <br />It is instead a study of twenty battles and how they were won, the individual, collective, tactical and morale-boosting efforts required for such a win. One may question individual  inclusions or exclusions but the battles were selected not necessarily for their geopolitical importance but to illustrate the author's point.  Namely that battles, particularly those in the past, were won by brilliant thinkers, unexpected events, inspired generals and dedicated fighters. <br />It is hard to quarrel with his conclusions - even the startling one that the battle of Warsaw in 1920 was perhaps the one that affected European civilization more than any other.  (A win by the bolsheviks would have condemned Eastern Europe, Germany and maybe part of Western Europed to the economic, political and cultural horror that engulfed the USSR.)  <br />The format is similar in all cases:  A brief forward setting the battle within a proper context, an introduction to the chief players, a description of what happened and then a one paragraph conclusion.  Very readable.	2003-11-23

Exapnding on his thesis that man attempts to recreate the nature's forms - particularly mountains - we are given a tour of the ages.  Starting with earlier (rather than primitive) civilizations, he shows how Mayans, Greeks, Egyptians and Aztecs attempted to replicate the mountains. This almost obsessive need to reach to the heavens is evident in our city skyscrapers.<br />Of course there was a religious, animist aspect to all this and indeed, one can trace the evolution of buildings in this book. First there are religious edifices, whether for a single God (as in the case of the Israelites and their initial worship of the sacred mountain), multiple gods (Mayans) or a combination of the two -Greece, Egypt.  Then there are structures for rulers whether nobility or military.  Only toward modern times do we dwell on private homes for the average (rich) citizen.<br />Symbolism was paramount for the Gothic ages and in modern times, through gardens and onramentation, we have attempted to recreate the untamed world beyond.  The final chapters on formal gardens leads to a study of modern architects and their attempt to &quot;merge&quot; or reunite with nature -  Frank Lloyd Wright being the prime example.

Fernandez-Armesto is brilliant, insightful, well-researched and opinionated.  He is a terific historian and social commentator witness his output: CIVILIZATIONS, MILLENIUM, FEAST OF A THOUSAND TABLES, IDEAS THAT CHANGED THE WORLD, etc.  <br />But this kind of writing is not directly transferable to the kind he attempts in TRUTH. All the small annoyances present in his other books have combined into a barely readable tome. The opacity is everywhere - a sodden blanket over the entire work. His praise (preference?) for primitive cultures is especially pointed here in his attempt to demonstrate a similarity of thought between ancient and modern humans in terms of abstract thought.  <br />This idea is repeated with all the finesse of a slegehammer. Of course Kogo from the Uhuri tribe was not aware of the sciences but yet could discern the truth from the untruthful.  But then  children do the same thing (which semi-invalidates his berating of modern anthropologists who compare primitive thought to the mindset of children).<br />This is one of those books that should have been terminated at midpoint, divided and parcelled into other works.

If he was meant to be a representation of Clinton (&quot;liberal Democrat with no foreign policy experience elected on a solely domestic platform&quot;) it was not a good one.  Clinton was a quick study who learned to make decisions albeit with the guidance of pollsters. <br />Thirdly the star of the book, the National Security Advisor, just did not stand out not, in fact, did anyone except the Russian general and the first American president.  The stories of the civilians was simply a page-filler, utterly predictable.  <br />Lastly, the aftermath of the nuclear devestation seems extremely light considering the horrors of Hiroshima after a mini-bomb.   All that aside, it was one of a handfall of books that dealt with the possible reality of a nuclear war in non-hysterical, even optimistic terms.  The beauty of the book was its combining of a military tale with geo-politics and domestic politics (although much of the action seemed far-fetched).  The battle plans were of special interest particularly the mock scenarios enacted in earnest. This story cries out for a reduction in minor characters and the accentuation of major characters.	2003-11-18

This, of course, does not include the millions killed in the Civil War and the years directly afterwards.  And if it were left up to Western intellectuals to highlight this holocaust we would still be waiting for news much less disapproval or blame.<br />Robert Conquest's tome reads like a documentary, describing a madness that one does not associate with civilized nations or people.  But he is relentlessly systematic, the research and evidence overwhelming and mindnumbing.  This methodical and studious approach is much more effective than anguished calls for revenge.  Perhaps the magnitude of the event is too great to grasp for some, is so far beyond the pale that it surpasses the senses.  <br />But that fact does not explain why even today the Soviet system has never come in for a tenth of the criticism  of Nazi Germany despite committing five to six times the number of murders if over a longer time span.  Worse, the regime had intellectual support in the West even after it's crimes were discovered - from the New York Times correspondent in Moscow to the usual bevy of college professors and \\"activists\\".<br />Conquest is measured but in this case the words and actions alone do not need shouting.  In more poetic hands, this could have been a requiem - instead we have a lesson for the ages.	2003-11-07

In a sense, his imporance and influence parallelled that of Washington in that the precedents he established became the tradition which lasted. Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, Adams obtained European aid, Madison authored the Constitution but in the overall scheme of things, the shape and  direction of our country, its economy and balance of powers, its legal and political system was virtually set by the power of one man - John Marshall.<br />What is even more amazing is how singular he was and how his stewardship was a near miss.  At a time when it seemed the whole country converted to anti-Federalisism and the Federalist party disappeared, there was Marshall, stalwart to the end.  WIth a vigor that lasted to the end, he fought the Jeffersonians and their vision of America as a pastoral, agrarian society of gentlemen farmers.  His rulings established the basis for the corporate capitalist system of property rights that has given this nation a level of prosperity never before seen. <br />More important, his rulings on Constitutional interpretation established the Supreme Court as the final arbiter of political decisions - something particularly handy in the 2000 election. Although Marshall represented a &quot;strict Constructionist&quot; viewpoint in the sense that he decried expansion of Federal power in what he deemed the wrong direction, i.e. the Jeffersonian direction, he was not averse to using the Federal government when the issue warranted. When he died he was the last of the &quot;old school&quot; but he set the pattern that has been adhered to every since.<br />Theh book is quite readable, the research admirable and can be understood by historian, lawyer or layman.	2003-11-04

The social analysis is on par with a high school freshman.  For starters, we meet a new heroine in Alaska, named after Lenin. For at least twenty years Marxism has been taken seriously only on university campuses and maybe North Korea but for some reason we must read twaddle about this \\"social movement.\\"  More ridiculous is the group setting up Nazi-like concentrations camps (they even talk like the Gestapo) for the rest of poor humanity which makes zero sense.  <br />Why in the world would intelligent, killer machines go to the trouble of recruiting human allies to round up stragglers, build concentration camps, release deadly viruses and, when they get sick, send those unfortunates to ANOTHER camp to be killed.  None of this action is in any way related to logic or rational thinking. All the machines had to do was build a few copies and start killing folks or let them starve to death.  It is just so absurd.<br />Then there's Sarah, heading off to South America like we'd take a ride to the mall (and this is after a global nuclear holocaust). How John rises from Alaskan back-woodsman to Grand Martial of Humankind is never fully explained (how can it be?)  We also learn that the reason all this is happening is that John misinterpreted / misunderstood the final words of his former love as \\"enter\\" instead of \\"erase\\".  Now THAT makes a whole lot of sense, right?  <br />I had real hopes for this but when we read about Nazis and Commies and Luddites and people killing survivors it's just too much.  Skip this one if at all possible.	2003-11-02

It is a book about cooking and there is a huge distinction.  In many ways it defies description...it is a homage to Larousse in its references to (and admiration of) classical French cuisine but it is not a didactic recitation of rules nor is it a mind-boggling tome about the science of cooking.<br />First of all, it is eminently readable and beautiful to view.  The pictures are all full-color and offer minute details rarely found in other cookbooks.  The steps for cleaning soft-shelled crab are a work of art.  It is a guide &quot;for the professional chef&quot; which includes those folks who make money cooking or those amateurs who prepare elaborate meals for the sheer artistry and taste. What is most helpful are the &quot;basics&quot; - the little things that professionals do that makes their food taste so good.<br />The first few chapters deal with the basics BUT is written with a professional in mind (how to buy meats in quantity, compute cost per meal, appropriate actions of kitchen workers, many descriptions). Then there are chapters on the science of cooking which require more than one reading.  Following that we come to sauces, creams, soups, broths and roux - in my opinion, without a doubt, the most important items in the book since these form the basis of every reputable kitchen.<br />A meticulous step-by-step approach is explained and illustrated in the best single-volume presentation of its kind.  Always, there are little hints and common sense rules.  Identifying meats, vegetables, fish precede actual recipes that are simply mouth-watering.  WARNING*** This is not a tome for beginners but is quite possible the best teacher outside of a classroom you will ever find.	2003-10-31

At first glance this appears to be an intruiguing coffee table book - large size, lavishly illustrated, extremely interesting, universally applicable to young and old.  But upon closer reflection one notes the vast scholarship that went into this work which was obviously a joyous task for the esteemed author.<br />It is arranged chronologically, starting approximately 30,000 BC (I refuse to use that absurd &quot;BCE&quot;). What is noteworthy is that the most important, most far-reaching, the most elemental ideas came so early.  For example, the notion of a spirit world, the idea of magic, of communicating with spirits, of matter....these are all concepts that we take for granted now since they are such a part of our evolutionary cultural psychology as humans.<br />Many ideas are still controversial - racial superiority, evolution, cosmology - but these have not been with us since the dawn of history.  This is an exciting intellectual quest for our heritage in the world of ideas.  What is especially gratifying is the inclusion with every two page article of particular works - one could say a mini-bibliography - with which one can delve deeper into the subject. <br />The work is amazingly non-parochial, putting the &quot;human&quot; ahead of the specific culture.  That does not preclude him from listing some ideas that have particular meaning only to certain groups, such as jihad or anti-semitism.  But even these limited application ideas affect groups outside the ones they affect directly.  What is especially appealing is the ability to pick up the reading at the next idea.  Since each is only two pages long, there is not much possibility of &quot;losing one's place.&quot;	2003-10-31

He is one historian-thinker who emerges as non-partisan and straight-forward.  While I thoroughly enjoy the works of Paul Johnson and have praised Daniel Boorstin to the skies, there is something magisterial about the author's works.  The level of scholarship combines with his always intriguing conclusions and suppositions.  What I like best about this trio is their apparent affinity for describing long arches of history which is not an easy task.<br />Throughout the book the author asks us to project ourselves 10,000 years in the future and imagine what a galactic museum would display as a representation of the past millenium.  He eschews such names as &quot;Industrial Revolution&quot; or &quot;Protestant Reformation&quot; or &quot;Dark Ages&quot; because these are not truly (to him) historical events but the name given to a series of happenings.<br /><br />He makes the argument that influences from one civilization to another tend to ebb and flow and it is only in hindsight that one can see the writing on the wall.  He has high praise for the Chinese Empire, it's culture and traditions.  He demonstrates (as does Boorstin in THE DISCOVERERS) that the emergence of Western Europe as a dominating force was something totally unforseen, particularly considering the dominance of China and the Muslim world.  Although it conquered the globe, to Fernandez this was only a temporary blot in the (apparent) onward march of the Pacific Rim. What is amazing (and controversial) is his assertion that despite the overwhelming pervasiveness of the United States in almost every measurable category, the pendelum has begun to swing back.  He demonstrates his thesis not through battles and politics but through the everyday lives of the people since these reflect the true cultural inputs.<br />The writing is beautiful - even poetic - and the illustrations that accompany the text are an added bonus.  This book is a labor of love.  I am not at all certain I agree with all of the author's assumptions but then what kind of historian would he be if I did?bor of love.

But all the while, Asimov has been expanding and introducing many externals, principally robots and their story and making it coincide with the Foundation Series. <br />Again, Asimov has an advantage of writing 30+ years after the publication of the original stories.  This has allowed further advances in technology and more time to flesh out the story.  We are involved with two men - Golan Trvize, an rebel of sorts who is searching for the mysterious Second Foundation and Stor Gendeibel who is part of the Second Foundation.  They are both interested in the ancient planet &quot;Earth&quot; and somewhere along the way they end up on Gaia, that was obviously settled long ago by humans. <br />Sorry, but the characters in here just do not excite.  They are worse that Asimov's usually lackluster rendering and I just can't keep them in mind after the story has concluded.  Also, the action toward the end gets confused as if Asimov suddenly had a change of heart or (more likely) he had an idea for a future book and had to incorporate some information here to make it work.<br />I was expecting something different, something more.  Maybe next time.	2003-10-30

He placed these at oppposite ends of the galaxy, one known, one unknown. Things were going smoothly until the periodic prediction (when Seldon appears holographically) was obviously wrong.<br />The cause is the Mule, a mutant of incredible mental powers who no one has ever seen.  The introduction of this character was one of the best plot devices used in a long time and it gave the fledging story a much-needed boost.  Who is this mutant and why does he do the things he does?  What caused his mental powers?  Can he be defeated?  But most important, what is to happen now that Seldon's plans cannot be followed with accuracy?<br />Stay tuned for book III.	2003-10-30

He does not have the turn of phrase, the poetic endownment, the ability to have characters change and grow and become interesting...but, his ideas have always been cutting edge without being over the top.<br />The vision of the breakdown of the future empire, of Hari Seldon and the school of psychohistory, the idea of setting up two Foundations at each end of the galaxy...great elements of a story.  There has been talk that Asimov &quot;borrowed&quot; these ideas from Campbell but if so, he gave them a polish and a new direction that completely transformed the otiginal ones.<br />One must grant literary, historical and scientific license to the writer in that many of the inventions we take for granted were only glimmers in the eye of a teenager in the 50's.  The ideas are stunning in scope if not in execution.  I would have loved to have seen a Heinlein or Pamela Sargent with this material.  Still, it retains the reader throughout...and sets up the next novel in the trilogy.	2003-10-30

The one thing I particularly liked about this book was that it was necessary to read the Foundation Trilogy to enjoy it.  So many times, writers make the assumption that you have read all the other books of a series and present the reader with strange and unexplained ideas and people.  <br />One advantage Asimov had in writing this story was time.  He had over 30 years to think about the original series and how it fit in with the other works.  He also could update the science which made it much more believable.  We are on Trantor and this is the story of Seldon, his fights, his studies, his love life (very high-level as in all Asimov novels) and his triumphs.  <br />Robots play a part in this prequel that they do not in the series itself for the obvious reason that Asimov had not yet come up with the idea of tying them together.  After 30+ years he has most of the pieces in place and can manipulate them at will.  The revelation of his &quot;wife&quot; was only too good.	2003-10-30

Of course, we all know by now that the Trilogy was just the beginning of the Foundation story.  We had prequels and sequels but these three remain the core of the saga.  In FOUNDATION AND EMPIRE we were introduced to the Mule, a mutant with mental powers so great he could change the course of history.  Since Seldon had set up two Foundations - one known, one unknown - it would be a catastrophe if the Mule ever discovered the location of the secret one.<br />This is a tale of innocence, of a 14-year old girl (Arkadia) and her friendship with a man we come to discover is the Mule.  The final battle -  as in all books of this type - correct all wrong and allows us to discover that the location of the Second Foundation was at &quot;Galaxy's End&quot; - the center of the galaxy, Trantor, where Seldon had resided.<br />The real trick now is creating the alternate robot stories that would intertwine and eventually unite with the Foundation Series creating a new entity.	2003-10-30

But the sequels to the series do not  - or cannot - measure up to the original.  Maybe the story has been done and it is increasingly difficult to introduce new material.<br />For the Series itself, the Mule and the location of the Second Foundation were welcome diversions.  Then there is the entire drama of the robots and their universe.  But at some point you have to say, &quot;enough is enough&quot;.<br />The same boring characters that were in the previous work are back and boring as ever.  I can put up with the lack of character development if there is a simultaneous introduction of new ideas but that is not the case here.  Their journeys are boring, their findings are boring, the writing is boring.  I started skipping pages to find something &quot;interesting&quot;.  At times the writing is almost like that done by machines - as if word after word were mechanically produced on a &quot;need to be&quot; basis.

The hero(?) is not quite an anti-hero but his antics are right in line with a Thereoux character.  Like other reviewers, I noticed the lack of character development for other folks on the island.  <br />The interpersonal relationships vie with Allie's relationship with his surroundings and himself.  He figures himself a savior when in reality he is a Don Quixote flailing at windmills.  A good but in the end unsatisying book.

I think Penrose would rather say machine \\"Computation\\" since he does not think of the human mind as an entity that can be explained in formula, alogrithms, or programs.   <br />Rather our consciouness, our \\"knowing\\" that we are who we are is an evolutionary process made possible through quantum effects.  That is Roger Penrose's argument and while it is an interesting one it is by no means definitive.  What Penrose has done, though, is relentlessly investigate questions usually left unanswered and in most cases, unasked. <br />For example, how did consciousness happen?  How did it evolve?  Is it still evolving and can it be replicated?  Once again, as in the EMPEROR, replication of an activity does not mean the same thing except to the outsider.   If a computer plays chess and defeats the world champion, it is an astounding feat - not of chess playing but of computer building. Big Blue did nothing that it had not been programmed to do and that is our quandry - at what point would a machine ever begin to do what it wants and for what reason.  <br />We developed psychologically and emotionally as we tried to adapt to our changing environment.  Our uniqueness is due to many things, one of them being a left-right brain.  To what conditions could a computer respond that would suddenly bring forth awareness?  How would it grow and evolve outside of organic matter?	2003-10-28

In other words, he does not believe that - because of some rather esoteric quantum effects - that our electr-organic brain can be replicated by electro-silicate.  <br />This does not mean that computers will not be able to mimic, to respond, to act in a way that one has no idea if the person they are talking to is a machine or human.  All this is possible, even probable.  But Penrose is on a mission to raise human consciousness above machine performance - or rather, to demonstrate that it is of a different kind rather than a different order.<br />My only problem with his analysis is that we simply cannot know what may or may not happen in the future as technologies merge and grow and intertwine.  With current technology there is not a chance that a PC will some day &quot;recognize itself&quot;.  But that is not the question really; everyone knows this.  The real question is what does it mean to be human, what is consciousness, and can these characteristics, traits and components be reborn outside of organic matter?  <br />Interesting, sometimes difficult read.	2003-10-28

When one considers all the pseudo-science, fads, and utter ridiculous irrationality that has crept into \\"mainstream\\" thought, a book like this ia like a good stiff drink to refresh the senses.<br />I have long been looking for a common denominator of wacky thinking and maybe Gardner has given the most plausible one - it goes against demonstrable science and is totally irrational. The Einstein was Wrong chapter was a hoot.  I still smile thinking of guys trying to disprove Einstein with phrases like \\"he done gone and tried to make us believe all that stuff\\".  <br />The wacky belief systems are also dissected but one has to keep in mind that this is BEFORE the age of the Hollywood medium, the channeling of the ignorant or the use of ouija boards (Reagan) or crystal balls (Hillary) at the White House.

(2) Once sanity has returned, there is an utter lack of apology, self-criticism and recognition of support for such evil.<br />Unlike Germany, neither China nor Russia have been particularly singled out by the culturally elite, despite the recognition that both nations behaved abhorantly toward the academic and intellectual community.  This was nowhere more true than in the &quot;People's Republic&quot;.  How is it possible for such an ancient culture to descend into madness on such a grand scale?  But in a hermetically enclosed place and with an ideology that promoted irrationality people, and particularly youth, can be manipulated into performing awful deeds.<br />Yuan Gao was away at school and was swept up in a fervor that gripped a nation far worse than any religious trauma. China was turned into a nation in which every citizen was suspect unless they participated fully in the madness itself. It was something so horrible and so unbelievable that even today the subject is rarely broached.  The human cost of communism is a subject that should receive more attention (but hasn't) and this story, as terrible and heart-breaking as it is, should help this lack of focus.<br />In the end, he did escape the madness but the horrors of those times will remain with him - and CHina - forever.

The most obvious contradiction, made evident in this stunning book, is that the garralous, &quot;life of the party&quot; was a genuinely private man. As Peggy Noonan has noted so many times, Reagan, unlike many of the political and intellectual intelligensia, never claimed to be smarter, wiser or more knowledgable that the rest of us. <br />The art of letter writing is dying the way of the manual typewriter. The fact that he wrote these thousands of letters by hand says something about the personal touch that he often exhibited. More telling than that, though, was the diverse spectrum of recipients - from nurses to widows to students in grade school and high school to union employees to heads of state to his children. And the range of subjects covered - from entertainment to religion to economics to literature to sports - showed a man who was interested in the whole of life. The man who &quot;trusted America to do the right thing&quot; demonstrated that trust in his letters time after time.<br />While some may have disliked his policies on various subjects, few - except the diehards who we will unfortunatey always have with us - will dislike the man after reading this book.

Nora underwent a tremendous transformation and her love with Travis was a thing of beauty. <br />For once, Dean does not star the bad guy but relegates him to second page.

What made all of those stories so well liked was - as it is in almost all stories - that these stories were character-driven in spite of all the hardware and battles.  You long remember the Cardinal, or  of the Kremlin or John Clark or even the young Jack.  <br />My personal opinion is that Clancy's writing started a slow descent when he began stretching what was and not possible in the political realm.  The rise of Ryan to VP, then Commander in Chief was just too...hokey.  From there we have more and more implausible scenarios.  These last few books seem to be ghost-written, or published without benefit of critical editing.  They commit the worst literary sin possible - they bore.  I found myself thumbing ahead, first paragraphs, then pages and finally whole chapters.<br />Is it possible that Clancy cannot break away from Jack Ryan much as Dorothy Sayer was stuck with Lord Peter Whimsey, Anne Rich with Lestat or Elizabeth George with her crew of five?

This is a story of such popes - those who led armies, who jocked for political position, who tortured, maimed, committed sacrilege so dreadful that it was only a whisper. <br />Yet, if one is a faithful Catholic, one would say that this is all just appearances - that they were REALLY the representative of Christ on Earth only they didn't act like it. It seems they never asked that ubiquitous question, &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot; It is hard to select the &quot;worst&quot; one...what is more awful - to massacre your opponent or to commit adultry on the throne? To lead a slaughter of &quot;infidels&quot; or join with Earthly political powers. Urban is a real winner, my candidate for Bad Pope of the Millenium but others are also listed.<br />This is not, by the way, an anti-Catholic tirade. If anything, the Church can claim to be truly divinely blessed for having survived these creatures.	2003-10-27

(That little fact is rarely mentioned in all the praises to the &quot;worker's paradise&quot;.) It so happened that he memorized the entire range of equipment and capacity and was able to recite this back when it came time to compute how much Castro had looted.<BR>This is an insider's story of the corporate world, the tensions and alliances, the rewards and penalties for both hard work and luck, the demonstration of the idea that if you work hard enough you can make it. Goizuela's rise occurred amid an upheaval in the soft drink industry. There was the disastrous &quot;New Coke&quot;, the challenge by Pepsi, the much-heralded secret formula, the introduction of juices and water....all are featured in detail.<br />A great book about a great man - reading about his funeral had me grinning and whistling along.	2003-10-27

The idea of Muslim terrorists operating in &quot;the former Soviet Union&quot; is a reality - not a possibility.   The notion of ethnic problems is also a reality.  And the possibility of parts of the former Soviet military rising and acting independently is a nightmare waiting to happen.<br />As usual, Clancy deals with international capitals, intelligence gathering, detail-packed war plans and battles as well as all the political ramifications.  The battlefield shifts across huge areas but throughout, he keeps the story unified without bulging apart at the seams.<br />The real problem is that Russia extremely weak economically, politically and militarily but still has lots of deadly hardware just waiting for an owner.  The Iceland scenario was really daring if not exactly plausible. Oil and resources will continue to cause problems in the future.  Great personalities / great battle scenes.  Vintage Clancy.	2003-10-27

Only in this case it is not middle-America suburbian married life that is being examined but poor Marcia and her gaggle of well-meaning relatives. She is introduced to loser after loser until there he is one day. <br />The sexual exploits combine with her amateur snooping to create a funny, intriguing book with characters as well-honed as the plot. Isaacs has a way with words and specializes in dialogue of the funny sort. I again laughed out loud over and over and the characters became almost like the people you meet daily. Good fun can be had by all.	2003-10-27

The mood, the story, the characters, the castle, I liked it all.<br />This Dracula is not the violent, blood-thirsty monster featured in so many of these types of movies. Instead, Gary Oldham (what a selection!) is the dark, sensuous eternal phantom, at once mesmerizing and intoxicating. The trick of using a diary is especially effective in this case in that it gives the story some structure. Even Keanu Reeves was good as the helpless husband.	2003-10-27

It was, in its own way, just as harrowing and frightening as WATCHERS or PHANTOMS. It's another Koontz favorite - the young lad with the older man. In this case its Colin's soon-to-be brother in law who takes him on a cross country relocation ride in the car.<br />Only someone is following them, threatening and closing in. It;s true that this is not as complex as others, or as long, and it does not have a love story (except by proxy) but it makes up for all of that with tense suspense and action. This is a jewel - a miniature to be sure - but a real jewel.	2003-10-27

This book attempts a distillation and mostly succeeds because it captures the essense of the man who was simultaneously many things - a complex, gentle person who became a persona.<br />For a long time he was defined by the equation E=MC2 but over time his other theoretical work has been explored (and many times dismissed) and more importantly, his early years and the ideas that emerged from that era have come more sharply into focus. The author provides a wealth of data on the European life of Einstein which is interesting in itself.<br />The author waxes eloquently on the non-scientific side of the man, the humanist that the world knows today. This is a beautiful, complete work covering all aspects of Einstein's life.	2003-10-27

Throughout the series he has tried to remain factually or scientifically correct such as the idea that huge dinosaurs could have never developed the brain size or build the structures required for their use and that without the devastating asteroid dinosaurs would have remained the rulers of Earth. <br />We continue our adventures of the &quot;human boy&quot; who interacts with the dinosaur culture. The dinosaurs are, in the end, simply prototypes of humans in their emotional and ethical outlook - some are good, others bad. This is a good read.	2003-10-27

No, they do not have the magic and the depth and the awe of the original but then I did not think I was going to get the exact message.<br />This book is not as bad as some have made out but it is nowhere near a 5 star category. If the story of Norma had taken more center stage I would have considered a 4 or even 5 star. But it was lost in the onslaught of the seemingly endless tales, and unlike the original series, these folks are not interesting enough to maintain your attention over the long haul. The book seems to continually be in a rush - the chapters have been reduced to chapterettes and despite the excessive length, a lot of what is said was not necessary in the first place.<br />I, for one, am sickened and tired of all the torture. I have got into the habit of skipping those parts but had to reread the section on Norma in order to understand her transformation. Some of the characters were better left unintroduced - the good fighter (is he supposed to be the prototype for Duncan Idaho?), the brother-in-law of Serena, assorted friends and wives and lovers - too busy. Serena can whine all she wants - grow up!	2003-10-27

It's not the type of lifestyle that most of us aspire to but in Susan Isaac's hands it is absolutely hilarious. This is one of the few books that made me laugh out loud - the word pictures created are too good for words.<br />IN fact, the whole tale - from plot to Jewish Angst to the heroine's thoughts - are the stuff of best sellers. I have a real attraction to those stories where the innocent bystander innocently becomes involves (and solves) a crime. This is all done between soccer rides for kids and fixing dinner for her hubby. (The movie was not nearly as good as the book but was still a hoot.) Definite read.	2003-10-27

The idea of the eternal vampire is an old one from Eastern Europe (originally from Egypt) and the joining of an actual person (Vlad the Impaler) with the legend set the stage for all that was to follow.<br />This book is in the form of a diary, surely one of the best mechanisms available when handled adroitly. The slow seduction of Mina by the Count can be interpreted in a number of ways but the best way is left to the imagination. There is always that ageless quandry - does one become a Vampire, lose one's soul, yet gain immortality? Get the book - better than any of the current crop.	2003-10-27

It was the first book of his I ever read and remains a favorite to this day. The eerie writing, the mood, the question of what in the world is making people act as they do is presented with arching suspense. This is not in his usual horror genre but is more a science fiction mystery.<br />I gave it a five even though the characterization was slightly weaker than in the other two - maybe it should get a 4.9.

Following on the heels of the hilarious COMPROMISING POSITIONS and CLOSE RELATIONS, I expected another fast-paced tale of Jewish angst. What I got instead was one of the most boring tales in the past 100 years with characters as forgettable as either the dialogue or plot. <br />I kept thinking the whole thing was a joke - that at some point the heroine would look up from her desk and mutter how awful this stuff was, wad it up and see a dead body. But no such luck. Unfortunately Isaacs now appears to consider herself a &quot;serious&quot; writer which apparently to her means the same thing as &quot;boring&quot; writer. The story of love lost and found and lost (ad nauseum) is one that we have all seen and heard (and maybe experienced) many times. As the old saying goes, &quot;Nothing venturned, nothing gained&quot; and there was certainly nothing gained in this outing.	2003-10-27

At first this sounds exciting but as he explained it, I slowly got the idea that it was nothing more than (pardon the pun) &quot;smoke and mirrors&quot;.

In this original work, he traces the &quot;history&quot; of time from both human and cosmic viewpoints.  Our psychology and manner of thinking affects our own outlook on the subject as much (or more) than the subject itself.  FOr what he states is that time is not a flowing stream but an entity - an actual thing - that ticks in a steady beat.  It's almost as if time were the heartbeat of the Universe and we simply dwell in its streams.<br />He also brings in relativity, time travel and other curious notions that we have all thought about but then discarded as too arcane for general discussion.  Reading Steven Hawking reminds me of those Isaac Asimov novels where robots, to save manking, disable our motor functions and we simply sit (&quot;With Folded Hands&quot;).  But this act somehow jump starts our minds into being able to transmit thoughts; it was aptly titled &quot;And Searching Minds&quot;  This is what I feel whenever I think of this man.	2003-10-22

As in all of Clarke's works there is an element present that makes the story ALMOST seem real.  In this case, he has written the ultimate sci-fi novel - First Contact.  And I imagine  that our first encounter will be even more wondrous and awe-inspiring than we can imagine. <br />The obscure mysteriousness of the aliens only added to the allure of the book.  This is the first of a series of RAMA books that surprisingly not only retain their interest but actually increase the suspense.  A grand achievement.	2003-10-21

The entire drama with Nicole grew and evolved to become one of the central foci of the book.  For that awesome scene at the end - and the realization of the meaning of the Universe - it almost deserves a &quot;*****&quot;.  But Nicole's other self seems so human like in her wants and desires.  We got to this point and the authors seem to be saying, &quot;OK, we know the secrets of the cosmos.

We've had them in the RAMA series and in CHILDHOOD'S END.  But this time we meet them by proxy.  Everyone is quite familiar with the story but the originality and suprises (aided by an extraordinarily perceptive cinematic translation) just keep coming.  It's like the author is drinking from a well of originality and talent that won't run dry.<br />I loved the man-machine/man-monolith/man-Jupiter interactions.  Clarke has ventured into the metaphysical here and the movie perfectly suggests to the viewer what we, the readers, can only imagine from the text. <br />The idea of an extraterrestrial boost to Earthly intelligence has been suggested before (along with the idea that life itself arrived from outer space via meteorite).  One still has to ask the question:  OK, so where did THAT life come from? Clarke simply assumes that &quot;it is&quot; without questions.  <br />Another theme present in almost all his works is that we on this planet are still children of the universe, we are in the learning stage and must and will learn from the more &quot;advanced&quot; races.  Whether this happens or not - my personal opinion is that it won't - it is still a good concept to bandy about.	2003-10-21

Well here we are again with the last installment of a once promising series that lost its way and descended into ennui. Who could forget the fantabulous 2001 or the almost as good 2010.  Somehow the literary aspects of the series seem to decline as the plot advances.  Gone is the initial sense of wonder and mystery; never present is interesting character development. <br />This last gasp seems to try but the old spark is gone. Clark again tries to give us his vision of a glorious future rampant with technology and neat doohickies.  But the real story is the tale of the monoliths and how we must desperately tell the makers of same that we are not the backwards race they may have originally considered us to be. Otherwise they might do bad things to us.<br />Which begs the question - why in the world would an intelligent lifeform send the monoliths to uncivilized worlds and expect a progressive civilization of harmony and peace?  That question, like many others, is never raised much less answered.  All in all, I am glad Clarke wrote the series but a more visionary 2061 and a more literal 3001 would have been a major accomplishment.	2003-10-21

His biggest concern was the inability of the educational system to teach children to think (as opposed to memorizing a string of mind-numbing facts). To accomplish this goal he, along with education professionals, developed a program based on the Socratic method of teaching.<br />For example, one exercise might consist of the following instructions from the teacher:<br />&quot;Today I am going to show an object to you and I want you to just look at it for one minute in absolute silence, At the end of that time, please write what you saw first and what question you have about the object. Remember, no talking, because once someone talks it disrupts and alters the others' thinking.&quot;  <br />This is a book with ideas that will challenge the way you have always thought about education.  Indeed, it will make you question what our educational system is doing.  If the purpose of an education is the creation of a well-rounded individual who questions and reasons and analyzes, then one will have to conclude that it has been an abject failure. Indeed, our society is increasingly split along two lines - a well-educated, erudite group that has developed a mocking attitude toward traditional conventions and manners and a non-educated group that carries a growing anti-intellectual bias.<br />For further information about the Paidea Proposal, you can visit the Radical Academy Site.  As a father who has seen his son prosper under such a program, I would recommend that any parent seriously interested in obtaining a true education for their child explore the possibilites presented in this book.	2003-10-21

He astounds us with a mind-blowing idea then, because of his inability to develop characters with which we can identify, he must rely on the original story or variations thereof.  The same thing happens here.  <br />2001 was a masterpiece of writing (and a cinematic jewel to boot).  Then came the almost as good 2010.  No novel characters were added, though, and we are stuck with the original plot only it's fifty years later.  This might have been a good story if it had not tried to be a sequel...the story of the flight to the comet, the message from Dave, the rescue - these are all good in themselves IF - and this is a big if - there are interesting characters.

I had expected a continuation of the extraordinary saga started in RAMA but instead the story seems diminished.  It appears that Clarke (or Lee - they have combined on other books) could not find a way to explore the lives of the earthly characters without losing the sense of wonder on the alien beings.  <br />Some of the events in the lives of these characters also seemed rather mundane for such an epic occurrence.  Here's hoping that the focus will revert to the correct source.	2003-10-21

One group of reviewers are geniunely concerned that he has a Western orientation, that he defends such ideas as democracy and capitalism, that he seems to speak for common sense, tradition and classical liberalism.  There is another group that supports him wholeheartedly because of these very views  and his sympathetic voice toward religion.<br />TEN PHILOSOPHICAL MISTAKES is an exploration of notions that he considers small mistakes that occurred in the past.  The effect of these mistakes is compounded over time until they produce a difference in the way we view ourselves and our reality.  He explores each of these mistakes in detail.<br />Guiding Adler's thinking is a reliance on the works of Aristotle and a look at both Greek and classical European methods of learning and teaching.  Also important is his view of humans as rational animals who differ from other animals - not in degree but in kind. <br />He has made radical proposals for education and reintroducing thinking to the classroom.  This is done not through a predictable &quot;challenge to the system&quot; but through the Socratic method.  Ironically, this method was widely used in the Arab world at the height of its power before being subsumed by theocratic stipulations.  This is a good book, not flawless, but one that is well worth five stars.	2003-10-21

They all have one thing in common though - the workings of the alien races are at first utterly mysterious, a puzzle for humans to solve.  But slowly, over time, we learn the true purpose (always something other than what is generally conceived).<br />At least he does not fall into the trap of an INDEPENDENCE DAY or any of the numerous copies in which Zoogoo from the planet Glowboh tells us mean Earthlings to stop our atomic testing or we will be destroyed.  Perhaps Clarke is trying to say that the difference in cultural perspectives are so great as to make it difficult to understand the workings of such higher beings.<br />This is a rather innocent book that has retained its charm.  Of course, the weak points are character development, the strong points being the plot line itself and the ultimate realization of our destiny.	2003-10-21

Mortimer Adler made it his life's work attempting to demonstrate the importance of philosophy in leading a civilized life.<br />Adler has been criticized for his conservatism, his allegedly Euro-centric viewpoint, and his refusal to adapt many of the nouveau philosophical ideas currently floating in and out of favor.  Adler demonstrated one truth:  COMMON SENSE IS NOT ALL THAT COMMON. <br />Drawing strength from Aristotles laws of logic, he traces the development of philosophical mistakes that over the course of time have been compounded into mass errors.  He shows that many times it is easier to take the simpler way out, philsophically, rather than fight for the ultimate truth.  Adler views humankind differently than many philosophers, seeing us as differnt in kind (rather than just degree) from the animals.  And like his mentor, Aristotle, he teaches that what distinguishes us from other animals is our ability to reason and think analytically.<br />Not only has he been involved in philosophy in general but he has also been active in applying such a viewpoint to the real world.  His educational proposals have wrought incredible results when implemented.  His proposals on teaching ideas have resulted in thousands of young philosophers armed with a new knowledge for facing the world.<br />Starting in the Medieval times, he identifies several errors in philosophical thought that have changed not just how we think but how we think about ourself as individuals and as a species. Mortimer Adler is a national treasure!	2003-10-21

It is a dynamic but reverent exploration of the 102 most important ideas of the Western World.  These works eventually ended up in the Encyclopaedia Britannica's GREAT BOOKS OF THE WESTERN WORLD.  They have now been published separately, a fact that all who are interested in advancement and civilization must applaud. <br />The ideas are explored in a variety of ways - from what ancient, medieval and modern philosophers thought to a discussion of the history of the idea to its influence in the modern world.  These are the building blocks of the foundations of Western civilization.  Until recently, people who did not practice or recognize these ideas were considered &quot;primitive&quot;.  Only recently has there been a celebration from certain quarters of the uncivilized, uneducated and uncouth.<br />Adler makes several presumptions, the foremost among them being that humans are rational creatures and that philosophical ideas are what really drives the world, with language being an adjunct of ourselves.  Many of these ideas concern how we consider ourselves and not only the world around us.  Throughout, Adler adopts a neutral stance toward support of a particular opinion but this does not mean he is morally or ethically neutral.<br />This is a good reference book and an interest coffee table addition - sure to enlighten and enhance any conversation.	2003-10-21

Once the idea, the plot, the germ of the story has been let out of the bag, it is extremely difficult to capture that initial excitement and even euphoria.<br />The ideas of our &quot;new&quot; sun, the further adventures of Bowman, the exploration of life elsewhere in the Solar System - all of these are developed well.  Of course, as in all Clarke books, it is the lack of character development that is crucial.  In order to overcome this shortcoming the story itself must be dazzling  as it was in 2001.  2010, though, could only exist on the shoulders of 2001 and for that reason deserves a '4' instead of a '5'.	2003-10-21

Much of the writing was about mundane people doing mundane things, petty conflicts, a lot of wondering and wandering and not much continuity.  Once again, as he has done in the past over and over, Clarke comes up with a superlative idea but his literary talents - or lack thereof - are not up to the task. Only rarely does he succeed with character development and this is not an uncommon occurrence among scifi writers. <br />I found myself staring into space several times and even peeking ahead.  The best parts were all the creatures in the Garden. It is an axiom that the really memorable science fiction stories do not center on the unworldly aspect but on unforgettable people - Contact, Stranger in a Strange Land, Dune.  This series could have been really remarkable but it has been dithered away. What a waste of time and energy.	2003-10-21

Some fault Adler for references to ethics - as if morality had no place in philosophical thought.  Others fault him for using common sense (as if that were a crime) and speaking in everyday language.  Others thought he was grand because he is a deist.  <br />Adler has written other books, better books, but one thing I like about all his books is their knack for inviting cogent comment and discussion.  If only for that reason, they are important works that should be at least perused.  Adler has offered radical plans for education and educators - a concrete program few have tried.  The heart of this program is getting children to think, challenging their common assumptions and making them think why they think the way they do.  <br />But to Adler this does not mean imbuing them with a political revolutionary zeal for &quot;change&quot;.  It means questioning their assumptions and defining what is important.  With that in mind he wrote &quot;Six Great Ideas&quot;, some of which are interrelated. To some, these ideas are dated but what he makes clear is that all six of these are universals and, because of their relationship to people, always will be.<br />For a better discussion of ideas get his 101 Great Ideas.	2003-10-21

Solzhenitsyn cannot himself from centering  on people.  Despite the epic events depicted, the start of WW1, the Battle of Tannenburg, the meeting of cultures, in the end this is a book of individuals, great and small.<br />The word pictures he has created of the rolling plains of battle, the lumbering armies, life in the military, are some of the greatest ever painted.  One is transported back to that date when backward, religiously zealous, serf-like Russia meets the modern age.  The story of the first vision of the industrial West by the illiterate Russian soldier - and the impact it makes on them - was breathtaking.<br />The story switches from one vista to another, battlefield to palace, and finally from the Romanovs to Lenin as the march of history continues steadily and inexorably onward.  Even knowing the awful outcome does not decrease the pleasure of the story.  At the end, you have come only so far and are ready for the next in the series, NOVEMBER 1916.  I like the method in which he has chosen to write history - the selection of specific periods of time which he considered to have had the greatest impact on the modern Soviet state.	2003-10-20

It is the conflict between the cultures of the two world powers, the USSR and the United States.  But a theme running throughout the book is how the world of intelligence is a culture unto itself.  This story is better than any fictional tale around.  Tom Clancy only wishes he could produce something like this.  <br />We are back in the final days of the Cold War, with both sides working through proxies and attempting to trump the other side in any way possible. What strikes one throughout is the motive  difference between those who chose to spy for the other side. The few Americans did so for money or revenge. The volunteers behind the Iron Curtain - and this included generals, high-up party members, scientists - did so for ideological reasons.  The two worse US spies - Hannson (FBI) and Ames (CIA) both loved the thrill and the money; both were contemptuous of the Soviets.  <br />In the end, this is an old-fashioned spy tale with all that that implies - skulking in the dark alleys, the drops, the chase, the planting of devices, transfers of cash, discreet signs, suicide pills, bravery, cowardice and a battle of wills in the agencies that exemplified the clash between the two cultures.  This is one of those books you just can't put down.	2003-10-20

One can fault Solzhenitsyn's monarchial views but his courage and stamina cannot be disputed.  <br />He has given us a penetrating portrait of another time and another place - somewhere unimaginable to those of us accustomed to freedom.  Remarkably, he has enfused it with a humanity that shines brighter than the frozen landscape or the continual cruelty.  In the pages of this book (written and secreted out in parts) the inmates lose their anonymity and take on a life of their own as we find ourselves shivering, crying, rejoicing and even laughing with them.  Tears in a Hades of Ice.  <br />Solzhenitsyn is more than a national treasure, a historian or an author.  He is the modern-day reflection of the ancient Jewish prophet, preaching to the unbelievers.  The portraits of his beloved Russia reflect the greatness that he feels Russia is not only worth but due.  This should be required reading for all high school students.	2003-10-20

This tale reminds one of such a set.  There is the outer doll, the Soviet state in all its uncaring, soul-numbing, politically drenched stasis.  Then there is the next doll, the Cancer Ward itself, a pitiful place where harried doctors and nurses attempt to attend to patients under the most primitive of conditions.  Finally, the last doll is the group of individuals that stay at the Cancer Ward - their lives.<br />This is a story about hope - hope that one can survive the system, hope that the disease can be conquered, hope for a future with friends and the things one values.  In his usual way, the author explores all facets of Soviet socity with a particular emphasis on the world he knows best - the world of the zek, the political prisoner.  The reflections of Oleg and his determination to survive shine through the utterly gray and workout Soviet background.  It is this dramatic accentuation that makes the word pictures so moving.  For despite all the reasons to give up, he endures.  This is a quiet novel but a deeply moving one, so different from the historical works that followed.	2003-10-20

He is also facing a culture, a souless state that seems to devour all who dwell within its guarded borders.  What is fascinating is the world within a world within a world.  First, there is the Soviet regime, then the Cancer Ward and finally the individuals within this ward - three concentric rings.<br />Solzhynetsin again provides the reader with an in-your-face portrayal of the Soviet state but his primary mission is the  exploration of the humanity of people in distress.  If there is one common theme it is universal hope - hope for freedom, hope for recovery, hope for the future.<br />Oleg stands out in all his suffering and good humor.  His portrait, against a background of drab, cold, gray and utterly barren physical, emotional and spiritual landscapes, is a tour de force of sympathetic semi-autobiographical writing.  Who can forget the pitiful state of Soviet medicine against the care of the nurses and doctors.  Again, Solzhynetsin the storyteller and Solzhynetsin the seer unite in an unforgettable portrayal of Russia and Russians.	2003-10-20

What a fantastic story!!   The slow and inevitable passage of events, the horrors of WW1, the breakdown of authority in imperialist Russia - all combine into an awesome conjunction of people and events.<br />But it is the characters that make this tale, for the lives of the individuals are what gives this story meaning.  The author also presumes that one is at least somewhat familiar with the history of the time.  I have always had trouble with the long, unpronouncable Slavic names (shortening them in my mind for readability) but if one persists, it is well worth the effort.  Solzhenitsyn is trying to WRITE history, to tell a story that he considers of utmost importance not only to the Russian people but to the rest of the world.	2003-10-20

Readers are already familiar with his obsession with orchids.  Now we have a whole case revolving around them which makes for a good intro.

It is also an exploration of the degenerating thought patterns of this man's mind.  The first thing one notices about this work is the lack of abject sexuality...there are no long erotic dream sequences, no detailed review of violent acts, no endless explorations into kinky sex.  <br />Our main character (I refuse to use the term \\"anti-hero\\") thinks of himself as a witty bon vivant who SHOULD have the power to mesmerize a certain woman.  You discover midway that at some point he abused this woman and is now taunting her.  Then he begins to unravel and slowly descends into madness that we view through his increasingly obscure diary entries.  Fascinating read.	2003-10-17

Anyone familiar with the series is aware that occasionally, the reader is given recipes straight out of the kitchen of Nero Wolfe.  These recipes are a pretty accurate reflection of the times in which they originated - turtle soup (on the endangered list now), Steak Delmonico, etc...  <br />This tale takes place at a meeting of chefs and the key to the solution is being able to detect ALL the ingredients in a particular dish.   This is a clever, witty and very satisfying read.	2003-10-17

Regardless of which guide one uses, both works are sumptious, filled with beautiful color photographs and admirable descriptive text.  It is the perfect coffee table repository, attracting both attention and creating many a conversation.  <br />This is a heavy tome, an oversized tour of the building replete with history, background and purpose.

If the chapters get any smaller we'll be having one / page soon.  <br />I think the real problem is that Herbert II tries to do too much in one book, spreads himself thin, and thereby hurts the overall work.  This tale could potentially have had it all:  Political intrigue (Serena &amp; Ginjo), Machine life, Norma (my fave!), the beginnings of the Guild, the Bene Geserit, the start of the mysterious bloodline, the rebirth of the human race, the Worm Rider, the Fremen, the Body Snatchers....in the end, it becomes a jumble despite the very sparse prose and strict structure.<br />If the author was soliciting advice, I would tell him to reduced the  number of characters, focus on fewer events and plunge deeper into the remaining narrative and characters. I truly wanted to enjoy this book but the &quot;awe&quot;  and &quot;mystery&quot; one felt while engaged in the original series is missing.  The &quot;House&quot; trio was - despite the paucity of plot and characters - actually better due to a concentrated focus.   Here's hoping for the better results next time.	2003-10-16

It is a series of vignettes about &quot;eternals&quot;, individuals who are destined to live forever.  Anderson brings these immortals to life (pardon the pun) with his ever-journeying tales of the past and the far, far future.  <br />It is his extraordinary vision of the future and how, in the end, it is companionship and love that matter.  Our bodies may face and we may become all mind (doubtful since our brains require sensory input in order to conceive most concepts)but we will always be human and need human relationships.  This is one of those superior scifi books (like Pamela Sarents' THE SHORE OF WOMEN) which serve as reminders that amid the garbage and throw away pamphlets, there exists stories that still have the power to invoke wonder and awe.	2003-10-16

He lived in an era which thought it not unusual to work in both the physical and social sciences.  In Hayek's case it was most important that his first love was biology since the evolutionary underpinnings of society were fundamental to his approach to the social sciences.<br />He is today remembered for such classics as THE FATAL CONCEIT, THE CONSTITUTION OF LIBERTY and especially THE ROAD TO SERFDOM.  He excelled in many categories and it was this fusion of various fields that made his work so unique and so vital. Starting as a scientist in the tradition of Ernest Mach, he soon began studies in economics, particularly value.  From semi-Socialist leanings he became convinced of the link between economic and political freedom.  This was the subtext of THE ROAD TO SERFDOM.  <br />His argument against collectivism and central-run economies are as valid today as they were in the early part of last century. Central economies fail because 1) Society has too much knowledge to be centrally commanded (2) all economic decisions become political and thus authoritarian and noncreative and (3) there is no way to set value (price) under Socialism.<br />THE SENSORY ORDER dealt with epistomology, then he branched out to philosophy and politics.  As an example of how Socialist we have become, Hayek's views were called \\"\\"liberal\\" and are now called \\"conservative\\" despite the fact that they're unchanged. He wrote one piece \\"WHY I AM NOT A CONSERVATIVE\\" which is a clarion call for libertarianism and classical liberalism.  <br />The book examines the clashes between intellectual giants - von Mises, Popper, Mach, Wittgenstein (his cousin) and others.  He was a secularist, a capitalist and a political liberal in the classical sense.  His work on monetary policy still affects us (adjusting interest rates to increase or decrease the money supply, \\"floating\\" currencies externally).  His influence withWestern politicians and intellectual leaders was and is huge. He won the Nobel Prize for Economics in appreciation for his many contributions.  <br />Almost as an afterward Hayek issued a brilliant statement.  The aim of all economists is the increase in material wealth. He wanted this accomplished through an increase in wealth (capitalism) rather than a confiscation / redistribution of wealth (socialism / central run economies). The battle between these two points of view are with us today.	2003-10-13

(As late as 1989, Samuelson could say with a straight face that the Soviet economy was more productive than ours!)  This book can be traced directly to the Austrian School of Classical Liberalism that attempts to define economic activity in terms of human activity, wants and needs. This is in direct contradiction to modern &quot;economic speak&quot; in which it is a given that the State play a vital if not pervasive role in individual human economic activity.<br />Von Mises, Hayek and Menger (among others) were diametrically opposed to a &quot;middle way&quot; between statism (socialism/fascism) and capitalism for one simple reason:  Statism, once introduced, becomes the dominant force and eventually wins the contest since in a centrally-run economy all economic decisions become political ones.<br />Von Mises struggled his whole life to develop general rules for economic activity.  There was (and is) a gray area in which economic theory and economic reality coexist in an uneasy relationship.  Despite von Mises assertion that economics was basically a theoretical science - as opposed to physics or chemistry where axioms could be physically proven - he continued to maintain that economics was a rational science based upon human needs.<br />It is this latter point that exalts his work.  For perhaps the first time since Adam Smith he set about demonstrating that Capitalism is the economic system most conducive to human nature, how it makes the most sense from a &quot;human&quot; point of view of wants and needs and rewards and - most important - how it delivers the goods and affects material life.  Both von Mises and Hayek were convinced that when the state attempts to lead economic activity, failure and misery are sure to follow since it would eventually become a contest among competing interest groups, each vying for their turn at the trough (which it has).  <br />Von Mises's work on economic swings was another example of brilliant logic that has held true ever since.  Hayek, because he was convinced of the evolutionary nature of the economic system, also believed in cycles.  HUMAN ACTION does its part in demonstrating the correlation between increasing State control of the economy and decreasing individual freedom.  After having heard yet another of the Presidential campaign &quot;debates&quot; it is apparent that the &quot;debaters&quot; get their economic schooling from the editorial page.  Let us pray this is a farce for the uneducated and they really don't believe what they say. If they do, the Viennese Classical School was correct in its predictions.	2003-10-13

Moreover, the movie with the same name is almost as good, a rarity in these days of manufactured characters, settings, plot and endings.  Despite what one may think, the author/father is the outstanding personality in both settings.  <br />This is the story of a boy genius who happened to play chess and even more remarkably grew up to become a normal child, unlike the titled champ.  The personal of Bobby Fisher imbues the story as no individual actually present could.  It is the aura, the mystery, the eccentricity and the incredible brilliance of the hiding former champ that one is forced to consider throughout the book.  <br />And no, they never do meet up but his spirit is embodied in the weird, exhilirationg world of chess.   This world is not a normal one in that an obsessions with an ancient board is the heart and soul of many player's lives.  They eat, breathe, talk, sleep chess; they pay former masters for lessons; they forego a normal childhood of soccer and friends and cartoons to play.  And, like other child stars, the parents are there to either support, guide, bully or console them.<br />Chess players must be psychologically strong since it is a game of ultimate power - perhaps the one place where substitute armies can battle for glory.  The movie's depiction of the sheer pressure on children to perform is vivid as are the mean antics, the terrible truth of seeing the end ten moves away and the ultimate glory.   From budding standout to champion, this is a story of love and adventure like no other.  A great read / a great movie.	2003-10-10

His novels are always intelligent and interesting and most emerge from authentic FBI case histories.  MERCY is not so much a routine who-dun-it mystery as an exploration of the psychology of fetishes and sex, particularly kinky sex - that is assuming one doesn't consider masochism, sadism, cross-dressing, and dominatrix luncheons slightly off.<br />There is another story beneath the obvious one and that is the practice of such behavior within the confines of polite society. The &quot;victimes&quot; are upper-class women of a certain type - the country club, suburban, once-a-week therapist type.  Lindsey has a real knack for looking at events through the eyes of the disturbed individual, again calling on his real-life experience (FBI profiling).    <br />The prose is rich and sweeping, the organization superb, the entire story always a little on edge. This is deeply disturbing novel but an important one.	2003-10-09

She has written several books on this theme, the most recent being the excellent &quot;FROM JESUS TO CHRIST&quot; in which she explored the evolution from a humble Jewish teacher to the always existing creator of the Universe.<br />In this work she attempts to (again) study both the Man and the times in which he lived.  In addition to the main question - Why was Jesus killed? - she is interested in what Jesus taught, what his followers believed at the time and how those beliefs became  transformed into a theology about Jesus instead of his teachings. Surely his disciples did not think that he was the son of Jehova and now reigns with two other &quot;parts&quot; of a divine Trinity. That theology was not developed until a much later era.<br />Frideriksen is not afraid to make pronouncements and conclusions that are at variance with other scholars.  She is always careful to support her thesis with solid sociological, historical and/or archieological evidence.  In this case she concludes that Jesus - and no one else - was killed because he was viewed as a threat to Roman rule in that volatile area. This has momentous portent since it effectively eliminates &quot;Jews&quot; as the murderous agent and denies that Jesus was crucified for the sins of the world. <br />The biggest problem is the seeming redundancy of much of the book with earlier works.  Perhaps this is a natural result of devoting ones work to a narrow historical scope.	2003-10-08

But when one includes the scientific qualities what emerges is a real gem.  When your dinner party conversation is lagging, place this on the coffee table for some provocative discussions.<br />The subject of evolution, it seems, is destined to stir up deep emotions on both sides.  And that is a pity because the essense of evolution is that over long periods of time, living entities  adapt and change according to the environment and the living conditions.  As a corollary, evolution also posits that some of these organisms successfully change (sometimes into something else entirely) while others fail to adjust and become extinct.<br />Evolution is the clearest explanation of why life on Earth is so interconnected, why reptiles, birds, mammals and fish share many of the same genes and why the Earth is dominated by helpless mammals. The approach to the subject was almost gentle, starting with old ideas, looking at how the first stirrings came about and following the debate up to the present.  Most of us never stop to think that evolution has probably been more radical at the cellular level than any other platform.<br />The illustrations are both beautiful and enlightening. This book is such an excellent one for raising discussion points that one could only with every child be allowed to take a course for six weeks with this as their only guide.  <br />The book makes an effort not only at informing us about the many misunderstood points but dealing with the sticky ones - how new ideas are adding more depth to the theory, the relationship between religion and science, the future of evolution.  All in all this is an excellent companion guide to the PBS series.	2003-10-07

I would have liked to have read this in the original.<br />The hero, a wretched outcast of society, has been blessed among all men with a sense of smell that enables him to create new and incredibly complex perfumes.  Despite his outward appearance and manner (his &quot;talk&quot; is indeed strange), his olfactory genius brings seekers and admirers.  Susskind leads us into a Europe of yesteryear, when things were much more primitive and the times we call &quot;modern&quot; were just emerging.  <br />One of the byproducts of a market society is disposable income and in this case it is used for luxuries, one of these being exquisite perfumes, designed just for the individual.  The act of creating these, the strange ingredients, the process itself was worth the read.  Many reviewers have commented on the apparent strangeness of the book, most of which lays at the odd styling and bizarre conversations and actions.

The biggest question one would ask \\"Is this a mystery with science fiction or science fiction with mystery?\\"  Regardless, it is a success - an erudite, artistic, novel of the future, simultaneously deep, exploratory and questioning.  <br />What I liked best was the seemingly logical continuation of present trends so unlike many futuristic visions: The increasing reliance on biotechnology - indeed the ultimate supremacy of biotech as opposed to silicone tech is a major theme throughout. The disappearance of religion and the resultant worship of youth and immortality, the loss of the family unit, the triumph of the market economy, the inexorable advance of science, the wars of terror and plagues, the vast eco projects.  All of these are simply extensions of current trends.<br />The inclusion of Oscar Wilde and the literary puzzles from the 19th century was a stroke of genius.  In fact, that character seemed to stand out about all others - even the detective heroine who understood that she was condemned to die after only 200 years of life.<br />And thus the question...when immortality is the norm, how does one view death?  What does death mean when it becomes more rare by the day?<br />The mystery itself was intriguing if a tad week at the end but the methodology of the killer was startingly original. The race and the snappy dialogue (along with the philosophical musings of the author and the characters) more than made up for this small deficiency.  In this - the second of the series - the author proves himself a visionary of the first order.<br />For a similar work, see A PHILOSOPHICAL MURDER, another futuristic detective story with literary and philosophical components.	2003-10-06

The author, a screen writer (from STARTREK fame) decides to adopt a son and ends up with one who thinks he's a Martian.  The best parts were the beginning, the various thoughts, the worries, doubts and hopes - and the first few meetings with the growing love and suspense.  <br />Gerrold remembered something very important throughout the story - he is the adult, the father, and as such must act in an adult manner when confronted with childish behavior.  He seems to have got the combination of love and authority down pat though the rough times are glossed over in parts.  This is a short book, almost a novella, but one that is definitely worth the read.	2003-10-06

There is and has always been a great divide between the Occident and the Orient on matters of faith and Campbell thinks this has a lot to do with the mythical origins underlying all cultures and religions.  Oddly, he begins in Egypt which eventually approached the Occidental viewpoint.  But it is in the deserts of that ancient land that we begin with the ideas being set by the changeless seasons and the Nile.<br />Next a study of Buddhist, Hindu and other Oriental religions is  undertaken.  Somewhere along the line, East and West diverged on the issue of religious thought.  One might say that Oriental belief systems harken back to the primitive in that multiple gods, representing various emotions, objects or ideas, were the norm.  This was the way of ancient Greece and Egypt but both societies soon &quot;evolved&quot; toward a semi-monotheism or gave life to sects (ancient Judaism) that adopted the single god notion.<br />Of the three, this book was the hardest to comprehend, perhaps due to the foreign names.  Still, it is a testament to the monumental research and innovative ideas of the author.	2003-10-03

The role of the divine in the Western psyche has evolved from the Primitive, flirted with the multi-dimensional gods and goddesses of the East before settling down to a one God belief. (Although one would have question how the idea of a Trinity fits in with that belief.)<br />The notions of sacrifice and redemption are heard throughout the saga, with many religions, lost sects and heresies sharing a similiar prophecy - that a Messiah would come who would lead them to victory.  But before this was another belief-the eternal battle between good and evil. Perhaps the hardest idea for Monotheists is the notion of singular God and the presence of evil.  This required the invention of yet another divinity - one that is evil.<br />Campbell traces the origins of Christianity, its strains and morphing theology.  Along the was and from an Arian strain of Christianity (which virtually rejected the oneness of a Trinity) arose Islam, a warrior religion that originally worshipped a desert rock.  The Kaaba, this rock, is still an object of adoration for Muslims and is circled by pilgrims annually. The ideas of sacrifice and atonement by at first an animal, then a person, had ancient origins - the sacrifice of the one for the many - well before Christian times.<br />Campbell continually tries to show the parallels between our modern religions and the now-forgotten rituals and beliefs that became universally imbedded in the Occidental mind.	2003-10-03

It is remarkable how much privitive mythology remains with us today in our culture. Joseph Campbell offers several provocative interpretations of the origins of many of our cultural ideas, how primitive man viewed nature and what his blossoming awareness of the world both within and without grew.<br />The universal belief system is formed from our evolutionary psychology much as the three instinctual fears of modern people (fear of dark, fear of snakes, fear of heights) were formed by our biological evolution, from the time when proto-humans dwelt in trees.<br />Campbell offers a look at how many cultures today exhibit the same reverence and point of view toward mythology that primitive mankind did and how many of these remain.  One considers such &quot;beliefs&quot; as animism (found in Native American and African tribes), people with a pipeline to the divine (witness the shaman, priest, witch doctor), the belief in luck, the &quot;evil eye&quot;, &quot;Father sun&quot;, &quot;Mother moon&quot;.  Indeed, according to Joseph Campbell, fertility in both people and plants played an important role in the development of such myths.<br />Much of the suppostion on the part of the author involves the  substance of divinity and how we communicate with it/her/him. The scholarship and research involved in this trilogy is simply astounding.  A mandatory read for anyone seriously interested in the birth of our deepest ideas.	2003-10-02

It is that rarest of works, science fiction popular with both scientists and readers. One detects the brilliant mind behind the prose giving us a work that is intelligent, probing and scientifically literate. Missing are space fights, dangerous aliens, gutter language, random acts of insanity, ESP,  invisibility - all so common in today's current crop. Instead, it is the story of a scientist drawn to the search for alien life despite opposition from both both scientific and lay communities. <br />Many scientists conclude that SETI is a waste; biologists in particular consider intelligence such a rare development (requiring incredibly special circumstances and literally billions of years to develop) that they despair of ever finding another species with which we can communicate.<br />On the other side, religions object that a search is against the &quot;will of God&quot; and fear that Earthly belief systems will be adversely affected if it is known that creation is not unique.   The real message is philosophical:  Humanity (to quote the movie heroine) is so small and so insignificant and so precious as seen against the background of the universal panorama. This conflict between science and religion is explored without being didactic. <br />He explains that science, unlike religion, never demands belief without proof, that its findings are always subject to change and challenge, and that it is an instrument that expresses our humanity in ways religion never can. Ellie's greatest epiphany is evoked by communion with the Universe, not with God.<br />The plot has been bandied about before but it is the masterful blending of character, story, theme and conflict that makes this particular saga so enthralling.  The movie necessarily differs from the book and while I miss the voyage of the five (and the rather incontrovertible proof that provides) the ending isnot only pleasing but satisfactory.  Every character seems almost perfect from the point of view of the book.<br />I have read this book more than once and discover new nuances h each time.  Dennis Overbye shares Sagan's spirit of discovery and humanity and any books by him are worth companions to this.	2003-10-02

We are transported back to the world of classic Italy and the castrati - that class of young men robbed of the fruits of their manhood in order to sing opera.  While the historicity is excellent as always, the characters evoke little empathy and zero sympathy.  <br />The whole novel borders on the tongue in cheek with all the overwhelming lushness, sensuousness, effeteness and sultriness she can bring. You almost expect an androgynous designer type to pop up complete with frilly shirts and heavy jewelry.  Whereas same sex [physical attraction] was simply implied or suggested in the vampire chronicles, it is fully explored in this work.  The entire drama of feminine men may be a turnon to Rice but arouses little desire or interest for most folks.<br />Rice tries to solve the problem of the utterly boring characters with languid language but it lacks the (pardon the pun) \\"bite\\" found in the vampire tales.  Give this one a pass.	2003-09-26

But the idea and execution was accomplished so well that I was willing to give it a pass. For some reason, Louis was very appealing in all his sensuous evil and self-doubt.<br />Rice has obviously fallen for Lestat as witness the apparently endless tomes to him that bestow an almost supernatural quality. She has chosen to make the self-doubting Lestat her eternal wandering and wondering hero. He is much too effete for my taste but Rice specializes in that genre, adding a touch of lushness.  She has done something else very cleverly by introducing material for future books. The stories of Marius, Armand and all the hints and unsolved puzzles strewn throughout the story are good for at least three more novels.  <br />The historical presentation was absolutely terrifying in its authenticity and mood.  France, New Orleans, Catholicism, fine wine - these are the things familiary to the author.  She is an expert at deep dialogue and thoughts though she has a tendency to blather on too long.  Then there is the matter or all that self-justification for murder of which she implies all vampires are entitled.  So read it for the story and give some literary license.	2003-09-26

This is a well-written, excellently researched book on the relationship between the Democratic Party and black people in this country.  It is still somewhat surprising to realize that as short time ago as 1960, Richard Nixon outpoled JFK in support of black voters.  Perhaps the biggest complaint heard is that political parties take their core voters for granted.  Both parties do this and it is not at all clear which is more crass in their arrogance.<br />Every four years we hear stern warnings from black &quot;leaders&quot; that the Democratic Party cannot take their vote for granted.  And every four years, the party nominates two white guys who make the patronizing church circuit - having ignored those same churches for four years - to deliver verbal abuse on the mean old GOP who is somehow against them. Predictably on Election Day, a 90% vote is given the party that snubbed them for four years.<br />Likewise, the GOP takes a message of fiscal responsibility to their core supporters. After four years of running up enormous debts, they promise change and warn about the spending habits of Democrats. Naturally, once they are in power, spending takes off with a vengeance - even the rate of spending increases - and they then have the gall to run four years later on a platform of &quot;lowering government spending.&quot;   <br />The first situation, though, is more tragic with all the dashed hopes, lost dreams, lack of effectual power and the requisite  demagoguery that has effectively enslaved one race to one party regardless of consequences.  The whole idea of community leaders telling people of their race to vote a certain way BECAUSE of their race is depressingly familiar and would be in court if not for the similar political leanings of the ACLU.  Change does not appear emminent due to the status quo we have all accepted.  While enlightening, this book is also depressing.	2003-09-25

Hunting is an intrinsic part of our biological evolutionary makeup since we have been hunters in one way or another for over a million years.  It is also true that not hunting can and does lead to starvation (only because of the lack of natural predators). But what opponents of hunting never &quot;get&quot; is the almost exclusively male &quot;fun&quot; one receives from such actions.  Perhaps it is a last reach for our caveman past since one no longer must fight or tame nature to get their buck.<br />Our hero goes hunting...but his target is the hunter.  The book is most effective in its right-on-target descriptions of the hunting culture, the special and expensive clothing, the decoys, the bragging, the thrill of the kill, the commune with nature, etc. Still, one wonders if all the elitists who sniff at hunting refrain from meat, leather, glue, tape and a host of everyday products that use parts of animals. In this story, our hero is resolute in his avoidance of animals and animal products.<br />In this backwoods he finds love and becomes a folk hero to some. Slowly, though, the hunter becomes the hunted and he must be more vigilant than ever.   The ending is both humorous and terrifying in its implications asnd the question it asks:  Do humans have the right to kill on behalf of prey? Rational people would answer with a resolute &quot;No&quot; but this is literature and some license must be given.  This is a disturbing story that deserved a wider readership.	2003-09-23

I had been mildly entertained by a few of Bova's Scifi works and was expecting something...different.  I have several complaints, first and foremost being structure. The book is filled with endless repetition as he introduces a theme then covers the same thing a few pages later.  The author takes on too much - we hear about war, \\"destruction\\" of our planet, unrelated historical stories of scientists, the philosophy of science, book burning...<br />What I am trying to say is that compared to a Dennis Overbye, Bova is a horrible science writer.  The prose has less poetry than a book review and seems abbreviated at all times, quick snippets of data with \\"info boxes\\" and then we are off to a new subject.  This is not to say that one cannot learn new things.  The SCIENCE was interesting, the varieties of light wondrous in their divergent but underlying unity, the history of some of the discoverers and discoveries were enjoyable, but...there is more to a book than one element. <br />He (mis)treats the reader as if they were first grade students, explaining the most mundane points as if addressing morons. The many attempts at humor fall flat and the organization would delight a maze designer.  What's missing is a good editor who would have pared this book about 100 pages. I would like to see this material in the hands of a good science writer.	2003-09-22

As in his other works, the author travels at a steady pace, casually informing and experiencing and reporting as he goes.<br />The premise offered here is quite revolutionary: Namely, that  it was Spain, through its colonization in the New World and particularly Mexico, initiated a culinary melting pot that has been bubbling ever faster since Columbus's voyages.  At first, the idea sounds preposterous but the evidence is overwhelming. He shows that many &quot;African&quot; foods were orginially New World foods, that the chili we associate with Thai, Indian and Korean cooking had its origins in colonial Mexico.  The latter also provided chocolate, corn, the tomato, various fruits and another colony (Peru) gave us the potato. <br />He goes on to demonstrate that French, Italian, Spanish, German and the other national European cuisines are rather recent inventions.  The tomato plays an exceptionally large role in the world of food and this despite the tirades and &quot;scientific&quot; arguments against it well into the 19th century.  Spanish food affected South America which affected Africa.  Some foods, paprika for example, traveled a circuitous route - from Brazil to Iran to the Arab lands to Europe.   Thus, the underbelly of Europe - Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia - to this day use the stuff in huge amounts.<br />Final chapters covered &quot;American&quot; food, what the term really meant and what our future portends.  Especially endearing were the tales of lonely innovators, scientists, industrialists and plain folk who - through sheer ingenuity and curiousity - added to the pleasure of mankind.	2003-09-22

Comparing this trilogy to other approachable histories of the War is like holding up the Hope Diamond with a flawed zirconium.<br />There is no better story of this defining event than this detailed narrative.  And the operative word is &quot;story&quot; for he not only reports on the military aspects (which is precisely how the great majority of us relate to the conflict...Vicksburg, Gettysburg, Atlanta, Richmond)- he also brings in the cultural, the political, the personal.<br />These works are extremely detailed yet one is never lost in the details.  Instead there is a long arch from the first shot to the inevitable, terrible end.  Many have stated that Foote tends to emphasize the South and that is true.  Three caveats should be noted, though.  One, Foote is a Southerner from a family of Southerners and second, the South with all its eccentricities and larger-than-life characters is simply more interesting. And lastly, the entire war - except for a brief moment - centered in the South.<br />Almost from the first word I was caught in the drama of this expedition that was doomed to failure not only on military grounds but also moral grounds.  The author suggests many reason for the war but seems to imply the most appropriate - the fact that for the first time since the Revolutionary War, the South was no longer ascendant within the Federal government and the situation could only get worse.<br />An epic adventure of the highest degree!

This is one of those cases.  One is  transportation back to Medieval England with its rich language, customs, the prejudices and way of life.  We are caught in the midst of superstition, religious mania, utter poverty and the beginning of the Renaissance. Without a doubt, this is one of the best historical novels ever written.<br />The writing mesmerizes as it breathes across the page. The tale is told from the point of view of four individuals, each of whom is entertaining in their own way.  The language is idiomatic and no false clues are given.  The main characters, particularly the poor servant girl and the first narrator, attract our attention almost from the beginning.  The ending is supremely successful as we sail away into the open sea to life in the New World. All in all, a brilliant job!	2003-09-22

This is MILITARY history with a capital &quot;M&quot; and a sharp salute.  While this is interesting within the context of a story a little can go a long way.  Some of these stories are fairly interesting while others read like punishment exercises by the Marines.<br />Of course these are better than the abominable Turtledove monstrosities (in which despite earth-shaking action changes the characters remain the same) but that is not saying much.

I, like others, have thoroughly enjoyed many of Bryson's other works. A SHORT HISTORY OF NEARLY EVERYTHING seemed penned by a different mind.  The book covers an important topic - English and its history and future.  Yet, despite the attempts at humor throughout the book, it reads more like a middle school book report.  <br />What galls me is when folks allegedly attempting to educated the general public make factual errors that should have been caught in the research stage.   The Eskimo snow myth could qualify for an Urban Legend, some of the derivatives are WAY off, the FBI has said it CANNOT tell where people are just by the way they speak, and worst - he says Esperanto has no definite articles and then uses one!  Go figure.<br />He is at his best in the historical analysis but it is too abbreviated.  Also well done are his (very) brief looks at the abysmal failure of &quot;created&quot; languages.  These will never prosper since they do not have a support base.  English, he demonstrates, is the most varied, the richest, the most adaptable and the most widely spread language in the world.

Well, that's what I got and the result is a huge disappointment.   As another reviewer noted, the bad ones were too long and the good ones were too short.  <br />My number one objection was the lack of an alternative story. IN many of these, 80% of the writing was a review of what actually happened.  So, in the one about Socrates, we get a lot of Plato, Aristotle, Archimedes, Perfect Forms, battles, but almost no philosophical suppositions of a world without Socrates.  In the one in which Jesus is not executed, the author could not help but keep referring to &quot;actual&quot; history and apologizing for even discussing the subject.  <br />The list goes on - the Chinese exploration tale centered on what happened with the Ming dynasty rather than an alternate tale. The Cleopatra tale involves a lengthy review of past history.  The people who read these stories already KNOW the history - they want a brief forward followed by the story, not another rehash of World Events 101.  Where is the imagination, where is the spark?  Very poor execution.	2003-09-12

At the first, the author announces that he is working as much as possible from primary sources. It is not clear if he personally  translated the Arabic, Greek or Latin writings or relied on the translation of others.  Regardless, this book excels on three points:  (1) It is imminently clear and free of technical jargon (2) It is highly entertaining and (3) It strives to present what the philosopher himself said and believed rather than what other critics or commentators said.  In other words, he managed to separate the morass of commentary from actual works.<br />The book is divided into three sections - Ancient Greek (pre-Socrates), the Trinity (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle) and post-Aristotle (Middle Ages).  He shows over and over the connection that originally existed between science and philosophy - from bizarre theories to modern familiar &quot;facts&quot;.  Aristotle, the ultimate &quot;Man of Reason&quot;, is the main character and the author's evident admiration of this genius is both evident and understandable. <br />Above all, Aristotle defined the essence of Philosophy - asking not only how but more importantly why?  His focus on mankind and what it means to be human (reason) was a watershed in human thought.  Yet even he was influenced by previous forerunners and many of his works were in response to them.<br />The tragic decline of philosophy - of intellectism itself in the new post-Christian world - was sketchily but ably documented and perhaps the short shrift given to this time frame could be considered appropriate considering the dirth of philosophical output during that 1,000 years. The enormity of the fall from Aristotle's life of reason to the Inquisition has seldom been presented with such vivid evidence.  <br />This is a book for all thinkers.	2003-09-09

The book serves as a vehicle for teaching the rest of us about this once dominant group that mysteriously disappeared (only they really didn't we now know).

We are again back in turn of the century New York City and the description is just as real as before.  Only this time the cast of characters has been augmented by a servant boy who becomes the narrator.

She is a cunning criminal with a first-rate mind that is always calculating the next move.  Again we have the intelligent and beautiful Ms. Howard going where no woman has gone before.   She is a modern woman for her times but never for effect.<br />SOme reviewers have criticized the inclusion of \\"famous\\" people but this was accomplished with a subtle touch and therefore is perfectly acceptable.  Again, one is mesmerized at the writing and description as much as the witty dialogue and swift action.<BR>Bravo!	2003-08-29

It is both a hard-nosed look - some woudl say an indictment - of the Age of Celebrity and our worship of same. (Not coincidentally, a recent poll reported that more people would rather be &quot;famous&quot; than rich.)<br />A group of &quot;real&quot; reporters are sent to cover the event when suddenly, television and movie characters (from sit-coms to dramas) join the fray and soon it is a wild free-for-all with  rich dialogue and numerous allusions. While a wide knowledge of literature is not mandatory but is certainly helpful as we attend the regularly scheduled convocation.  Some complain that the story is too hard to follow, too &quot;literary&quot;, too &quot;esoteric&quot; but the real question is why in the world a reader of literature would complain about the literary aspects of a novel. <br />The chase scene, the interaction between the fictional and &quot;real&quot; characters (who, when you think about it, are also fictional) is a thing of beauty.	2003-08-29

This tale of Lincoln reminds one (strangely) of Safire in their fidelity to history.  The characters in this book simply rise from the pages and stay with the reader long after the pages have turned and the book has been closed (the highest praise possible for a novel, by the way). <br />We meet the 16th President who is presented as a multi-faceted man instead of the silent, stone-faced Chief Executive we have all become used to seeing.  The political ins and outs - Gore's specialty - are not only clever but vibrant.  There are many tales here - political, military, personal, family - and Vidal does a good job of combining them all into a highly entertaining work of art.  <br />As usual, it is the minor characters that make the book and this case is no exception.   The less-notable politicos with all their scheming and planning emerge as wholly human and quite understandable.  The book is longish but with writing like this it seemed like a novelette.  This should be a welcome edition to everyone's library.	2003-08-29

He has penned a hilarious story about the making of a porn movie.  There is nothing to say but that the characters are as outrageous as the action and this is NOT a book that goes from one ribald act to another.  It is (truly) about making a &quot;blue movie&quot;.  I still smile when I think of the dialogue (quote unquote) as the evil, Yankee soldier prepares to deflower the helpless, Southern beauty.  The book has a very satisfying ending.	2003-08-29

Two women, amateurs, head to Europe in order to try cheeses.  In the process they receive an education in all facets of the cheese industry from animals to growing to types to - best of all - the history behind a number of popular cheeses.<br />They are adventuresome eaters and what is particularly endearing about the pair is their unabashed enthusiasm for their product as they sample and smell and spoon all manner of things. No sophisticated air or silent nod of the head from these two. They traipse through country after country in Europe eating as they go.  The chapters are divided into logical categories - mainly by types of cheese - &quot;aromatic&quot;, cheddars, blues, Double and Triple Cremes), Monastery, etc. They present a good discussion of the pros and (mostly) cons of &quot;pasteurization&quot; and the resulting blandness in the American diet.<br />Some parts of the book are hilarious - the Goat cheese contest is worth the price of the book alone.  The recipes are simply an added bonus with the tip of the hat going to the beer Welsh Rarebit - a snack of divine origins.	2003-08-27

It is not escapist horror (as in unknown beasts ravage innocent maidens for no rhyme or reason) or sci-fi (&quot;We are Koogans from the planet Doogoo demanding you stop your atomic testing&quot;).  No, it is not only intelligent but makes an attempt at halfway serious science.<br />Despite all the scientific writing it is the story and action -  especially the riveting journey through the underground tunnels - that is absolutely some of the best suspense ever penned.  Very few novels can &quot;scare&quot; the reader or bring them into the story as RELIC seems to do.   This appears to be a universal view. And the characters were perfectly matched to their dialogue and action.<br />I also bought RELIQUARY at the same time so am excited about the followup.	2003-08-27

Two things stood out: (1) WAY too much emphasis on the military and not nearly enough on the political/philosophical aspects (2) A real lack of imagination in the events described.  <br />The writers seemed to be from the &quot;old&quot; Tom Clancey school - pack as much military jargon into as few paragraphs as possible. After a while the mind swims as you read about the &quot;3rd Corp of the 22nd Battalian or the 5th Armored Division or the 56th Motorized Unit...&quot;  or the rather esoteric nomenclature about the various types of tanks, jets or ships.  A quick glance at the contributors revealed an overwhelming number of military authors when what was needed were some from the political and literary fields.  I am sure that Newt Gingrich or Gary Hart or even Bill Clinton could have written an adequate tale.  <br />Characters were shown at their most extreme - Stalin (cunning and evil), Johnson (frustrated), Carter (ultimate Capitulator), generals (crusty), soldiers (obedient and patriotic), blah blah.   These all have elements of truth but tell us something we didn't already know.  <br />Some stories were extreme - Pakistan holding off a combined onslaught by the USSR and India or China holding off a massive Russian attack by sheer numbers. &quot;Lightning&quot; provided humor in an otherwise pretty dreary read. &quot;The Invasion of North Vietnam&quot; was perhaps the most daring while most were much ado about nothing.  The problem I had with these &quot;alternate realities&quot; is that in the vast majority, history was not dramatically changed.<BR>Also there were no nuclear exchanges to amount to anything. <br />THIRD REICH VICTORIOUS, edited by the same author, was richer in both literary and conjectural components.	2003-08-27

I found myself laughing out loud several times at many of these admittedly wacky but witty tales.  <br />The subject matter was in itself a winner - he touches on everything from non-fat fat to fruit ripening to when to buy certain products.  And this is the best feature of the book - it is not only entertaining but also informative...the best of both worlds.  He does not have the poignancy of a M.F.K. Fisher or the razor claws of the reviewer Simon Britchky or the down-to-earth charm of a Nika Hazelton but in his own way, he is just as good.	2003-08-26

THE MAGICIAN'S TALE did not fall into that trap.<br />The story of the female color-blind photographer is just as interesting as the idea of such a combination.  The author seems to excel in both characterization and setting - you could almost feel the San Francisco fog. I really enjoy books in which the main character \\"somehow\\" becomes involved in a crime and solves the mystery her/himself.  I also admit that I like the female detective genre simply because of both the limitations and the opportunities denied or offorded a female detective.<br />This is a great read from a relatively new author.

By food lovers, I do not mean those that drop by the Golden Arches for a Big One with Double Cheese (Supersize it, bud!) but those individuals who savor food in all its many, splendid variations.<br />What is so depressing about the current state of food in America is a dichotomy.  We have practically any meat, vegetable, fruit and ingredient at our fingertips yet choose to gorge ourselves on the dullest, least-taking and most mediocore items day after day.   For those who enjoy not only fine cheese, good wine and savory desserts but also the ART of food, this is the book for you.<br />This book is as much about life as it is food - its struggles and singular triumphs.  Ms. Fisher discerns with an unerring accuracy what is and is not important to human beings. These are friends, mates, children, family, and shared experiences. In a special on Ms. Fisher, she cooked and served a fabulous meal in her small kitchen then waxed eloquently on whether or not to wash all the dishes before rinsing or wash and rinse each individual piece.  THAT is the kind of curious, ever-searching mind that has given the world a literal library of excellent literature about the subject of food. <br />It is difficult to choose one book over the other but the stories from France seemed to resonate.   Then again, what could possiblt best the Alphabetic vignettes or the one on Oysters?  This is essential reading for the civilized person.	2003-08-26

The only problem is that they tend to overlap in my mind....<br />For example, which one had the hilarious French Eatathon, which one had the article on ripening fruit, where was the essay about cheese?  Regarless, both of these are just excellent works for quick reads.  Unlike MFK Fisher, whose ouevre reads like novels, Steingarten seems to have found his gait as the food reviewer in Vogue.  The articles seem somehow &quot;Magazinish&quot; and this is not necessarily a bad thing.  He takes a fresh approach to food and eating in general - not reverent but certainly serious.	2003-08-26

This interpretation, though, is only one of many that co-existed the first century. Indeed, a perusal of both New Testament and accompanying writings of the day show an intense battle among various factions - all claiming to represent attempting to set the agenda.<br />Fridrekson argues that what we perceive as the basic Christian message came about over time through compromise, cultural wars  and sheer power politics. The split between Christians and Jews was presetn as soon as Jesus was deemed \\"God\\".  The idea of a god impregnating a human woman is mythological and was (and is) deemed heretical by Jews.  They never thought the Messiah would be divine nor that his rule would include Gentiles. This set the stage for two millenia of Jewish persecution. Indeed, one of the first acts of the Church was to ban the Ebionites, a group of Jewish believer in Jesus who did not consider him divine.<br />A contradiction in the New Testament is present if one knows the date of origin:  The earlier the book, the less that was known of the life of Jesus.  The first books (Paul's works) show a remarkable lack of knowledge.  Mark (written next) starts at manhood while Luke and Matthew go back to the birth.  John, the last written, starts at the Beginning of the Universe. This process became static only when a conference of Christian bishops voted not only on Orthodox theology but on approved Scripture.<br />This is an important, well-researched work that should demand more attention.	2003-08-26

After all, the Communist Party of France approached 40% of the electorate at one time.  Regardless, this novel is a good mix of both the science fiction and mystery genres.  Involving a huge computer, a lot of action and a long chase scene, it makes a very good read.<br />No, it is not LeCarre or Ludlum but it is an underrated page turned worthy of a lot more attention than it has received.	2003-08-25

Others recall particular challenges and/or accomplishments - Hoover (dam), Eisenhower (Interstate), Kennedy (Space), Truman (atomic bomb).  It's difficult to know in which group Bush will fall but I lean toward the former simply because of the enormous threat imposed by Islamic radicals and their access to WMD. It is not just the existence of WMD.  After all, Russia had them for years with no problem. It is the new phenomenon of sympathetic nations willing to supply these to terrorists that we  have yet to fully comprehend.<br />Bill Sammon has penned an inside history of the events leading up to 9-11 and the ensuing  response. It is a sympathetic tale (toward Bush) but it is fair and complete.  It is a fact of the modern world that terrorists cannot exists without sponsering states.  It is another sad fact that all of these states are utterly repressive in nature and remain in power only through a  secret police and sheer force.  <br />The story is actually a series of vignettes gleamed from on-the-spot reactions from DC insiders and reads much more like news han politics.   One witnesses the evoloution of a new President from a disputed victory to the greatest crisis faced by this nation in years.  After rereading the responses of politicians directly after 9-11, one notes that none fathomed the new world dynamics or called for a combined effosrt against both terroists nations and the terrorists themselves. <br />There is, naturally, an element of politics in all this and Sammon features both supporters and detractors (particularly the media).  One of the most depressing - but utterly predictable - occurrences after 9-11 was all the hogwash about \\"why\\" they terrorists did what they did or did we bring it on ourselves and what do we have to do to keep people from doing this. Despite all the yap, 9-11 changed the political terrainn - witness the GOP campaign in 2002 capturing the Senate and retaining the House.  This is not a heavy book - about on par with BUSH AT WAR.  But it is a highly informative and entertaining book  - perfect for a rainy Saturday.	2003-08-24

This kind of thing - a war tale with lots of action - is a almost a sure hit in the right hands and one cannot argue that the book was a page turner of the first degree.<br />Still, the convoluted time eras, the non-stop action and the predictable ending caused me to remove a star.	2003-08-22

The one theme - - apart from the relationship between personal and political lives - is how First Ladies viewed and interpreted that most ambiguous of positions.  For this is a story told from the point of view of the woman - not the man - and for that reason it is all the more intriguing.<br />Each President has natural strengths but the adage \\"Behind every successful man is a woman\\" was never truer.  The marriages can be divided into three categories - normal, those that recovered and those that  never reconciled.<br />In the first category are Truman, Ford, Bush I, Bush II, Reagan and Carter.  Lady Bird and Jackie chose to accept infidelity as part and parcel of the marriage while Roosevelt, Nixon and Clinton committed acts that forever scarred.  Indeed, sexual infidelity seems a secondary theme.  Eleanor never trusted FDR after her discovery, Jackie sought refuge in other arenas, Lady Bird found a life in other activities and Hillary - the most humiliated of all - found solace in a career apart from her husband.<br />As far as ideological sway, I found very little to challenge.  True, the author seemed to praise Democratic administrations more than Republican ones but her personal stories were strictly non-partisan. She would sum up a chapter such as ,\\"The Clinton Administration is the story of a marriage\\" or \\"For Nancy, it was always only Ronnie.\\"  She managed to find the essence of the relationship and her conclusions were not only surprising but surprisingly on target.	2003-08-22

Ludlum has a similar problem with Michener, Koontz, Auel and many other writers.  As their imitators become more numerous, their output has increased in length until now they approach the density and complexity of encyclopedias.   Line up the Ludlum works in chronological order and the growth in girth is evident. <br />All that aside, this is a stupendous work and a wonderful conclusion of the trilogy.  Jason Bourne, after many trials and tribulations, finally engages his arch-rival, Carlos the Jackal. Yet his actions have become so typical of characters of this genre...despite their strength, terrifying resolution and mental prowess, our hero makes some pretty dumb moves.  And the only reason for these moves is to advance the plot - they were that transparent.<br />Still, Ludlum brought it off, finished the series and can now move on to something else.  I give him a \\"*****\\" for effort if not for perfect execution.	2003-08-22

Ludlum is at his best when he ignores current likes and dislikes and worst when he uses already overworked themes. This book reminds one of the new television season in which you know that if a show about runaways was popular last year, there will be 10 others like it this year.  <br />Hoover is an easy guy to hate with all his quirks and secrets and prejudices.  He served for too long, accumulated too much power and used his position to bribe or blackmail as baldly as Kennedy, LBJ or Nixon.  Still, he turned the FBI into the force it is today - a respected, professional group admired around the world.  <br />But back to the story, the tale is intriguing in spite of its trendiness.   All the intrigues - where conspiracies and boogeymen seem to pop out of every hedge - advance the plot.  One thing I liked about this book is its leanness - Ludlum has gotten expansive for expansion's sake.  Not his best but good for a beach read.	2003-08-22

For sheet storytelling, suspense and convoluted plot resolution, it remains supreme.  <br />It is characterization that drives this book - much more so than the movie - and particularly the interplay among the various guests.  This is vintage Ludlum before he became Ludzilla, the author of sagas of immeasurable length. This is also the typical formula that Ludlum uses in his best books - a lone guy gets involved in nefarious activities involving the government and both people and events are not what they seem.  <br />The moment when he awaits the arrival of the agent, when the agent walks up and we all hold our breath - the revelation is simply stunning!  This is a classic.	2003-08-22

It has probably the best hero in all of Ludlumville - Evan Kendrick.  The story of the Middle East is intriguing and the action and conclusion are near perfection.<br />This is one of those books in which I enjoyed the changing of the settings with the chapters.

I have been on an endless search for the perfect Paella for years.  Several places have come close but none were as good as some made from the recipes in this book.   Half the fun of eating Paella is in the making of it....what ingredients to use, how to cook them, mixing all the various components, selecting the proper wine (a white sangria is perfection itself).  <br />The accompanying information is almost as good as the recipes themselves.  And the best feature of these recipes is that none is out of the range of the better-than-average cook. No tedious or long steps, no stuffing of chicken legs or boning of tiny quail - just grilling, cutting, and cooking.  I prefer a Grilled Paella - or at least grilling the individual components. One must remember at all times though - Paella is, above all else, a RICE dish.  That is the essence of a good Paella, the semi-crunchy red, saffron enfused grain.<br />To those who had trouble with the temperature or cooking time I would suggest adjusting their time/temp for their own applicances.  I have both a convection oven and microwave and know that most times are reduced by a third.	2003-08-19

It is a delight to read as the author practically exults in the joys of good, home food and excellent preparation.  Ms. Hazelton does not, though, intend to suggest that this is \\"restaurant\\" food by any means.  She states repeatedly that the recipes contined here are standard fare in Italian families that still cook AND can be had in some parts of Little Italy in New York.<br />Fresh ingredients, homemade sauces, strict measurements - these are the components of good Italian cooking.  Not only the basics but some extras are also covered.   The book is conventiently divided into first, second, main course with salads and desserts added as separate chapters.   It would have been helpful to have included a section on wine.<br />The book contains several line drawings (vs color photographs) and while this is prosaic, a few color shots always adds some spice to the meal.	2003-08-19

Even so, it is both an intriguing tale (how he got the fourth star) even as it contains some of the best behind-the-scenes restaurant action ever written.  <br />One grasps the passion, the obsession, the degree to which the performers immerse themselves in every aspect of food from both the &quot;business&quot; end (running a restaurant) and the &quot;artistic&quot; end (selecting, preparing, cooking).  Just reading through one of those hectic nights is exhausting but the author seems to have been in the pits with the major players.  The outtake vignettes such as the episode on making reservations or on the quirky but faithful customers are sheer joy.<br />And who has not imagined such a dinner as the one that finally concluded the book.   Bravo for such an effort as this one!	2003-08-19

She is a self-described activist who is not afraid to part ways with the Left when she chooses.  Still....there are problems that must be addressed.  For one, many of her works leave one cold and perplexed though the nature or this particular work seems to have addressed at least the latter problem.  <br />Let's start with the basics - this is science fiction writing at its worst, the kind that features extremely unlikely scenarios without reference to historical or contemporary trends.  Despite this, it is also a very good story even if in that inimitable, ackward stilted prose that seems an Atwood trademark. The idea of a future classroom studying an American theocracy is not so much insulting as ridiculous since any oddsmaker will give the chances of an American fundamentalist coup at 100,000-1.  <br />I thought at first that this was a parable but the moral message was somehow omitted.  In any case, it is a tale of a young lady, a handmaid to the wife of a powerful leader in the regime. The ruling class resembles not so much religious fundamentalists as those believers of secular religions (socialism, fascism, etc).<BR>Despite their almost worshipful reliance upon Old Testament teachings - absurd in the light of rampant Bibical illiteracy - the rulers are almost uniformly corrupt and hypocritical.  In the end Offred manages to take her just revenge, escape and join the Revolution.<br />Atwood had difficulty deciding the paramount issue - feminism, religion, politics, economics...all were involved in some literary diatribes.  Men, religion, acquiescent women, rulers and the market economy seemed to take it on the chin as a matter of course.  The problem in the end is that Atwood (or any so-called \\"activist\\") fails to offer an alternative society in which they not only have all the material goods they want but are equally able to offer protests whenever they like.  They may do one or the other, it seems, but not both.	2003-08-18

The author emphasizes themes both modern and ancient. On the modern side, there is diversity - a concept in danger of becoming a societal demand rather than a cultural expression. There is also the issue of sensitivity to other believers (or non-believers), again an idea that has gone to its illogical conclusion of universal neutral expressions concerning religious issues.<br />The author rightly speaks for the role of religious ideas in a liberal education.  The most powerful arguments for introducing children to religion and its role in society are traditional: (1) An education is incomplete without a knowledge of the historical importance of religion.   Indeed, one might rightly be as viewed culturally illiterate without such learning. (2) An understanding of different religious faiths does more to promote acceptance and diversity than any federal mandate possibly can.     <br />It is nothing less than cultural suicide to forbid teaching of the incredible importance of religion in art, music, literature and government. What kind of educational establishment denies to students a study of the major historical and literary influences of that culture?  The biggest illusion is that we can ignore our cultural roots without long-term societal peril.  It is as if one taught an art course and omitted perspective or trained a surgeon without knowledge of the circulatory system.<br />It is no surprise that societies that once included religious knowledge as part of the curriculum - Western Europe, the United States and Australia exhibit the greatest religious tolerance.  Not coincidentally, Latin America, the Muslim &quot;Arc&quot;, India and Africa (Mandated Catholicism, Islam, Hinduism and tribal beliefs respectively) are the most intolerant regions on Earth.  There is a short distance from ignorance to prejudice to hatred and we ignore the warning signs at our own peril.	2003-08-18

She constantly seeks to address the human condition, whether it is muscular distrophy, racism, senility or, in this case, deafness.  <br />George specializes in giving us the thoughts of the characters and in this way drives the story forward.  This novel is no different as we seem to slowly approach the heart of the story in a circular, closing motion.  The insights into deafness and the many ways everyone reacts to it are simply phenomenal.  This is a difficult book to read with a slight touch of amorality but in this case, the story and the writing appears &quot;correct&quot;.

What a turn around! From the first sentence I was captivated with the story of quantum displacement (not Time travel as the title implies). All the comments about the &quot;absurdness of the plot&quot; or &quot; that the idea is not clearly explained&quot; misses the point. This is a sci-fi chase tale on which literary and scientific license should be bestowed. <br />As in all Chricton novels, the weakness is in the characters. The conversations are very surface and never serve as an integral part of the plot (which is primarily action; no real relationships emerge - just people thrown together by events. The habit of &quot;movieizing&quot; the book is becoming annoying. One can almost visualize the director yelling &quot;Cut&quot; or &quot;Action&quot;. If the middle had not degenerated into a castle chase tale this book would rate an A+. As it is, it's great escapist fare for a cold night.<br />A last word on the &quot;scientific&quot; aspect. The author's novels are always more intelligent and deeper than the movies. The pattern continues here and it is unfortunate that it will not be present in the movie.	2003-08-15

That theme crops up again and again and again. The novels are growing in length but not in depth and breadth and originality. Koontz needs to take some time off and develop an original story before dashing out the next one at neck-break speed to meet the publisher's deadline.<br />You want cliches? How about an evil psychiatrist, &quot;specially designed drugs&quot;, the tender, literate blue collar worker with the beautiful wife, the emotionally and mentally crippled helpless souls, the victim no one believes, the satanic parents, etc. Considering it all, it is a suprise the story turned out as well as it did. <br />It is presented in his classic &quot;switch action&quot; technique - his story / her story / his story... The premise of drug induced zombies has been approached from almost every conceivable angle and this one is far from original. One detects previous works in each book and this is no exception. So many have been released that repetition cannot be avoided. The bad guys are remarkedly similar. <br />The trouble with popular authors is the eventual slide from quality to quantity. I am not asking for an Elizabeth George or Bram Stoker. I do ask for a little imagination and originality. The author has shown he is capable of creating works of great power (The Watchers, Strangers, Lightning). He owes his public something more.	2003-08-15

He has ventured further and further afield from &quot;pure&quot; American history as he has matured.  Or perhaps he understands that &quot;history&quot; is more than dates, battles, places, royalty, marriages and wars.  More than anything else, history is about people and in this area, Boorstin shines.<br />This series of essays concerns the improbable or I should say the unexpected in various realms, mainly science and history. As a Euro-centric writer with a reform Judaic perspective he has a natural expectation that humankind will continue to achieve, learn and triumph.  The only thing negative about these essays are their dissimilarity and irregularity.  There is also an uneveness in quality that many may find jarring.	2003-08-15

It literally exudes &quot;cinema&quot; on every page. The story is flimsy (a farce really) and the action is so predictable that I guessed the end of each chapter midway through. One can detect the scenes written with the (new) movie in mind. Compared to the first book, it lacks credible science, mystery, believable characters, and a plot. Once again, the author is at his worst with character development - you just can't feel close to any of these cartoon action figures. Here's hoping for a better job next time.	2003-08-15

It's importance though lies far beyond its literary value and that is precisely the reason for the still-ferocious battles over this work.  It has had a profound influence on the American scene - one that is continually undervalued due to the diametrically opposed views of the intellectual and academic elite that set our cultural norms.  <br />I'll make two admissions - one, I loved the story and the book for its literary worth and two, I did not finish the SPEECH.  It would have been helpful if Rand had been more open to the idea of editing and pared back both the speech and some of the many redundancies one finds.  That aside, one is astonished at the originality of the seminal idea - that people of ability should stop apologizing for both it and the material goods that ability engenders.  If there is one point the book makes with perfect clarity it is a clear explicatation of who depends upon whom.<br />The intellectual earthquakes triggered by this book can be seen in the Libertarian Party, the birth of mainstream magazines as REASON, the acceptability to admire the one system that has provided better than any other (capitalism), privitization and deregulation and the ascendancy of Greenspan, a Rand disciple, and monetary policy.  These are all enormous shifts in thinking from what was the norm in the fifties and sixties.<br />As in the Fountainhead, the hero remains shadowy, more an idea than a person.   Just as the FOUNTAINHEAD was the story of Dominique and Wynand, ATLAS SHRUGGED is the story of Dagny and Reardon.   The rise and fall of the industrialist alson with his affair and love of his life is the central driving force of the book.  I would have loved to have seen this made into a movie or better - television series over several nights - but now think it would have been impossible to faithfully present the action in the same spirit as the book.  Let the story stay as it was meant to stay - it is more refreshing that way.	2003-08-15

How is it possible that particular cells in our body can differentiate among physical objects and send electronic flickerings to the brain that then interprets this collection of atoms into familiar objects - a computer, monitor, keyboard, words or letters? <br />The details are explained clearly with many good diagrams and illustrations.  We get something on the history of vision, the cellular and neural interplay that has combined to produce this miracle we call sight, and the comparison of photoelectric and other artificial methods of seeing with our human one.<br />Another great addition to the Scientific American Library.	2003-08-14

This book goes a long way not only on explaining why animals, plants, stars, planets and dust have certain shapes.  It also is useful in explaining why giraffes don't grow to be 800 feet tall or why a tree isn't as big as a skyscraper.<br />But that is only one part.  The other discussion concerns the recurring shapes found in nature (and apparently throughout the Universe), and I am talking about more than the proverbial snow flake.  Mathematics is kept to a minimum and pictures, diagrams, illustrations and drawings are plentiful.<br />The author attempts to tell WHY certain shapes seem universal and then migrate that concept from the inantimate to the living world to explain shapes in nature.  This is a book that deserves multiple, leisurely readings.	2003-08-14

But not only is the prince a character but Queenie is one of those Mom who feel equally at home wining and dingin at the palace or punishing an errant slave.<br />After a while you want to shout, &quot;OK Ok, we get the message&quot;.

What I did find was a sometimes humorous, always informative writing on the subject that seems to have gripped the psyche of modern society - sex.  <br />But this is not sex per se.  Instead, we deal with the why of sexual selection.  Disciples of science fiction are familiar with aliens in which there are no or multiple sexes. But this situation occurs on Earth and indeed, if the author is correct, was the original way of all things.   Non-sex remains the norm among the \\"lower\\" organism - bacteria, plankton, viruses and appears to be one of the most telling evolutionary developments. <br />The author offers an enlightening and extended discussion of sex among other animals and plants as well as a good explanation of sexual processing at the cellular level.	2003-08-14

The one criterion I judge a novel's quality is - Do the characters become so real that I think about them afterwards?  In almost every case (excepting the short stories) this has been the case.<br />Unlike many writers, Ms. George does not live in the Community of the Young and Restless. While it may be easy to write about beautiful, carefree \\"young adults\\", the reality is - as a French movie director remarked in an observation of American cinema - the world does not consist of 15-21 year old people and their earnest angst.  After reading A PLACE OF HIDING, who can forget Frank, China or especially, Paul?   <br />The action is moved from England this time, a British isle that was occupied by the Germans in WWII, and the characters are the inhabitants of this land.  A few chapters introduce us to the main characters, the major one remaining shadowy and furtive to the end.  On every level - emotional, mental, physical, psychic - a web of deceit and disloyalty strikes.While I was disappointed that Havers was not present, the play between Simon and Deborah charted new waters in unexplored territory.  <br />George has a talent for making us uncomfortable because we all have either been in these positions or know full well someone who has.  As she has stated previously, the majority of people live lives of quiet desperation, only revealing their innermost thoughts and desires when one least expects it.  The writing is again superb, exalted, and the multiple conclusions - as each and every end is tied - hit with the force of a sledge hammer, particularly the final scene in the graveyard.<br />This is a vacation book non par excellence! Another intelligent, sometimes witty, always erudite addition to any collection.	2003-08-12

First there is Sue Grafton and her alphabet series, always a casual, enjoyable read without a lot of thinking.  Moving up, we get to Patrician Cornwell and her excellent, sometimes great works which are darker and slightly more complex.  Finally at the top there is Elizabeth George, the Titaness of Mystery, whose books reed of erudition, superb crafting, intelligence and studies of the human nature second to none.<br />The eerie opening, so fitting yet foreboding, leads into a complex tale of murder and mayhem. The same cast is back again though my favorite character, Havers, is not a major figure this time around.  Despite the incredible writing it is the final synthesis of the various plots that makes the whole affair worthwhile.  In other words, her literary abilites are highlighted by her technical abilities.<br />What can I say except run to your local bookstore and snatch this up?	2003-08-05

Written from Russia in the early 20th century directly after the Red victory, it literally radiates with a forceful tale of evil in the guise of good.  Worse, the evil thinks it is good.<br />Modern totalitarian states are based on the premise of a Utopia - entites that are by their very nature static and unchanging. No surprises, no questioning, everything planned to the last nut and bolt. This utter predictability is a major drawing card for the masses since both democracy and capitalism are messy, unplanned, redundant yet gloriously effective in granting to the individual almost unlimited freedom.   <br />The novel reminds one of Anthem by Rand in its depiction of the solitary man attempting to rise above the herd.  Then again, one hears echoes of 1984 and the everpresent voice of Big Brother.  In all three cases, the State strives to eliminate any display of personal privacy.  Remarkably, WE was completed long before either of these and holds up well today.  <br />Modern technology has allowed the State to become all powerful, all-intrusive, awesome in its ability to warp and trap the minds of human beings. The scariest messages today are those promising planned societies in which everyone has their place while the  benevolent leaders care for us all - shades of North Korea.   <br />Russia has always been a collectivist nation from its earliest days. Whether it was tribe, religion, Party, economic class, ethnic class - the group was always paramoung over the individual. This book is a lesson we shun at our own peril.	2003-08-05

The subject was engrossing, the story of the rivalry between the heroic Frenchman and the brilliant but cheating Japanese researchers interesting, the history of the plague informative.  BUT it was very condensed; the chapters were quite short and needed fleshing out.<br />I did like the organization - alternating between a breakout of the plague in modern India and the one that struck turn of the century Hong Kong. Particularly disturbing were the tales of modern plague and the rather easy conditions needed to engender such a horror.<br />The author did not spend enough time with the main story.  He concentrated on colonial conditions, the prejudice of the imperialists, the still-existing problem of health in the 3rd world.  But the heart of the story was the rivalry between the two researchers and the plague itself.  This could have been a brilliant book - instead it was only above average.

What is missing from all the tomes lamenting the poor condition of Muslims, particularly in the Mideast, is the seeming absence of sympathy for the very folks they purportedly support.  The author has an almost reverent respect for the glorious Islamic past and seems to lament the long slow descent into oblivion. He also has a sympathy for the trapped peoples in the string of endless dictatorships from Morocco to Pakistan.<br />What had been a vibrant culture of science, mathematics and literary exploration has become a cesspool of tragedy.  It is a harsh judgement, but the arc from Morocco to Indonesia is artistically, financially, scientifically, militarily and polititically irrelevant in the modern world excepting oil, terrorism, and Pakistan's nuclear weapons.  The big question Muslims ask themselves is not &quot;Who did this to us&quot; but &quot;What did we do wrong?&quot;.<br />I gave only four stars due to some redundancies and the lack of a definitive reason why Islamic states have turned out like they did. Of the many reasons suggested (religion, geography, arts, denigration of women) one surmises that it is a combination of several, the foremost being the role of religion and the state.  A secular state is possible (Turkey) but extremely rare.  The role of law, art, science and civics in modern society still takes its cue from a 1400 year old book. <br />People who recognize their secondary standing want reasons (or scapegoats).  Islam has alternatively blamed Christians, Jews, Western imperialists, capitalism, other Muslims, even communism. None of these is correct in itself.  It is true that Christian Europe surged ahead in almost every endeavor; it is true that Jews established the only successful state in the area and defeated five Arab armies; it is true that Westerners conquered them;it is true that capitalists discovered and exploited the one natural resource of the region....      <br />Not only the West but now the East is forging ahead.  Korea,a devastated nation just fifty years ago and without natural resouces, is a super-economic power.  More telling, Malaysia has shown the ability to join this move to the 21st century as long as religion has been constrained from government.  <br />Israel is mentioned only in passing and this is correct since the existence of Israel has absolutely no bearing on 99% of the Islamic world.  Why should Algeria, Qatar or Indonesia care if a tiny slice of land in the Fertile Crescent is occupied by non-Muslims?  The solution to the problem will require deep and perhaps earth-shaking changes in attitudes and perspectives.  The author ends by noting that European ways have conquered the world and even those detesting this influence will use European methods to register their distate.	2003-08-03

It reminds one of Proust's streams of consciousness except that there is zero/zilch/nada literary quality present.<br />The main character is a multi-billionaire introspect with a retinue of worshipful aides (though why this narcissistic non-entity should command so much as a second glance is beyond me).  His mental gyrations are presented as having import when they are simply the inklings of a madman. Our hero lives in a 48 room modern palace and is bored with everything - career,  marriage, relationships, sex, life.  <br />It's 2001, the brink of financial Armageddon, and Eric wants a haircut after investing the whole wad in the currency futures market - you figure out the connection. He spots his wife of 22 days in another car, pops over for a chat and implies that their marriage has yet to be consumated. A presidential visit creates a traffic jam and we hear the ravings of the anti-industrial crowd protesting global capitalism.  Interspersed in this drivel are the ruminations of a lone soul who seems as confused as the main character except he is not a multi-bilionaire.<br />Our hero proceeds (in no certain order) to have sex with someone (female), undergo a physical while chatting semi-erotically with a female aide who for some reason is present, murders his bodyguard (he felt like it), laughs at the stabbing death of a bigwig, tells his wife he married her for money then meets his stalker, the confused man mentioned above. The ending is simultaneously confusing and boring - death by ennui.<br />The \\"writing\\" reminds one of a middle-school paper - absolutely no subtlety or literary grace, just word after word to fill up space. Towards the end you think that this is nothing more than paragraphs, then it is reduced to sentences, then words and finally one suddenly realizes it is the alphabet, clumsily arranged so as to resemble a book.  I wishthere were a negative score for this horrendous thing.	2003-08-03

The writing seems straight out of a bordello on a Saturday night.  By turns it is sensuous, informative, exploring, erotic and tender.  The prime factor deciding my vote when I read a novel is this:  &quot;Will I still remember the characters long after the book is over?&quot;   In this case the answer is definitely yes.<br />The relationships with the respective fathers and the play on the religious (Catholic) and Southern aspects are Rice staples but it was the latter part of the story that really made the book.  There may or may not be such an isle in the Gulf but after a while you sorta get the jist of what happens.  The escape and consequent action lets the book spread its wings and the author to again display both her love and knowledge of the ultra-languid New Orleans.<br />The movie is a hoot but don't expect any kind of erotic feelings since it is strictly tongue in cheek.	2003-07-31

New? Well, that is an understatement.<br />The first one had poor Beauty in the castle with her prince. Now she has been a bad girl (Rice's favorite kind, apparently) and joins her fellow slaves in a town of the common folk for fun and games.  I think everyone at some time has thought of at least a variation of this - having beautiful gals (or handsome guys) around for pleasure.  Giving literary license, one can almost find this stuff in the realm of possibility at some point way in the past.  Again, we have a suffering of the soul and again all those mixed feelings in which Rice excels.	2003-07-31

Then on to the horse races with the human horses - almost a hilarious concept if you think about it.  Rice does well, though, in exploring the depths of the soul and how it is consumed by the feverish, steamy situations and people they inevitably encounter.	2003-07-31

First of all, this is a well-written, well-documented story roughly divided into equal parts history and agitprop. The author says he is a \\"former\\" communist.  This combination seems to be a requisite these days with NPR featuring a whole phalanx of commentators calling themselves \\"progressive\\" who just happened to be former Reds - you get the pic.  <br />The author attempts to give a definitive history of Leftist politics in this nation. That is - and this ia a big \\"That is\\" - if you assign to a variety of historical national impulses the term \\"left\\". The author stresses that Socialism is not an alien movement but is as patriotic as Old Glory and in one sense he is right. American Socialism has never advocated the type of authoritarianism found elsewhere when Socialism was imposed - whether in the USSR, Africa, Asia or Cuba. If they had, they would have become more irrelevant than they already are.<br />Western Socialists refused to address the major dilemma - someone must persuade citizens who do not want the \\"benefits\\" of Socialism to accept and this must be done through the use of force. The book is best in the historical sagas, worst in its ideological cant: good reading / bad pleading. <br />Socialism may have been a native movement but it ran against the grain of this nation's historical preference of tradition and experience over theory. For a while it seemed that a genuine movement was eminent but, according to Weinstein, events always intervened and set back the movement. Socialism was unsuccessful in America for four reasons that the author discusses in varying degrees of detail: <BR>(1) Its adherants were permanently temporary. The poor got wealth, students alienated the middle class, farmers hated state control and unions rejected the idea leaving academia - the one place that still takes Socialism seriously.<BR>(2) Socialism was morally discredited due to its fervent support of Stalin and other dicatatorships. We hear again about how the the USSR didn't practice \\"true\\" Socialism.<BR>(3) Socialism became synonymous with poverty because, well, all Socialist states remained poor and that is not a vision to which Americans aspire. <BR>(4) Socialism never offered a viable alternative that insured wealth, choice, opportunity and a positive vision of the future. Its negative agenda (looting and redistributing wealth, control of production, implementation of social engineering schemes) were rejected out of hand. <br />As a former philosophy professor used to say, you may have a lot of answers without a solution. To counter capitalism's argument that you can work and gain wealth, Socialism offers the appeal of an egalitarian society - where some are more equal than others. It did not work in the past and will probably not work in the future	2003-07-29

I was expecting little vignettes of Company life with the same roster of characters but the depth and variety of characters, settings and plots was simply stunning. Maybe it is true that the short story - as opposed to the novel, poem, saga, chant or song - is the real American art form. If so, then Ms. Baker has accepted that challenge with gusto. <br />The author is said to be a fan of the X-Files and in that show, one quickly grew tired of monsters and weirdos, yearning instead for the ever-changing, ever-evolving mythology which girded the series. The Zeus books follow a similar pattern. If &quot;The Garden of Iden&quot; is almost childlike - you might say innocent - the following tales evolved into philosophical treatises on the nature, reason and ultimate fate of time travel and, more than anything, the mysterious Chronos Corporation and its hidden agenda.  <br />These are splendid stories although it is imperative that one is first acquainted with the preceding novels to which they allude. The sequence seems random but one discovers a serial-like order of presentation. The young lad with the extraordinary powers shows up several times and the attentive reader will discern both the hows and whys of his origin. Some of these stories sound boring in the extreme until the first paragraph. Suddenly you are caught in the web spun by the author and the only escape is finishing the tale. <br />Some are tongue-in-cheek (Lemuria), some are explanatory (Search for the Delacroix), others are reflective of the author's great interest in English history (Shakespeare). All possess that unique &quot;Baker&quot; quality that permeates her works - the excellent turn of phrase, the fidelity to the character and the times, the occasional surprise and the relentless movement of the logic to its conclusions, tragic, maudlin or triumphant. Many of these could easily be developed into novels, a task I hope the author will undertake in the future	2003-07-29

The author excels in sustaining suspicion throughout the novel as we wonder if what we dare think could be true really is. This is a tale that shimmers just beneath the surface where most of the action lies.<br />The only problem is the main character. He never becomes as real as the other characters, perhaps due to his utterly boring persona. Still, the story of Americans who just happened to be ancient gods who play scrabble, bowl and argue is captivating. The earth-shaking finale has parallels with many others - Buffy the Vampire, Mortal Combat, X-Men - all, by the way, as American as apple pie.	2003-07-29

Here it is in all its glory, triumph, personal pain, sacrifice and unbelievable scientific achievement: The Story of man's attempts to transcend these \\"earthly bounds.\\" <br />The characters are simply awesome - the only word possible. The sHuntsville setting was of particular interest since it was presented as a normal town with all its quirkiness and not as a \\"Southern\\" city with all that implies. The story of the German scientists was captivating but the emotional heart of the story was the love story between the main character and his wife which survived the disappointing choices of his children and his profession. <BR>The mixing of real and fictional characters (along with real and fictional places, i.e. Fremont) only added to the authenticity of the story. Yes, there were some technical mistakes but these were nothing compared to the overall arch of the story. <br />The repeated question, \\"What is the role of man in space?\\" was never really answered. Speculations abound and it seems we will always have the \\"but we have so many problems on Earth\\" crowd with us. In the end, this is not only a tribute but a requiem for a heroic era. <br />Needless to say, the television version was about as close to the book as a GI Joe action figure is to a real Marine. The emphasis was on (what else?) SEX and all the little intrigues that seem to monopolize TV land. The science, the wonder, the awe that one found in, for example, CONTACT, were conspicuously absent. Skip the show, buy the book.	2003-07-29

What an idea and what a better execution!!! With all the reports popping up every day about the widespread lack of sleep in our society, this may be an idea whose time has arrived. <br />The author specializes in dialogue and thoughts and the tales of SMART (vs smarmy/hateful/creepy/sassy/whining) kids and their trials and tribulations was superbly written (similar in thrust to the Ender series). It is difficult to imagine ordinary folks becoming agents of hate and revenge, but what lurks right under the veneer of civilization? All in all, this was the superior of the series as is most often the case. That does not mean that you should skip the others, and the author continually introduces new ideas and curve balls to keep the action flowing and suspense suspenseful. The author also attempts what few sci-fi writers dare - a scientific explanation of the sci-fi within the book. Grab the series for a long vacation read at the beach.	2003-07-29

Especially fun are the huge games in which you are sometimes centuries meeting your nearest neighbor. The most annoying facet is control of enemy territory.  It is nearly impossible to keep a city once it is captured as it almost always reverts back to its former owners. Fix this bug!	2003-07-29

This is the first Lincoln Rhyme mystery I've encountered but I guarantee it will not be my last. The story, characters, writing and dialogue were just \\"magical\\". It is a truism that every book teaches something but the information gleaned from this story transcends the type - the facts about magic and police work are just astounding. <br />I am not sure which is better - the real characters or the convoluted, sleight of hand, but satisfactory plot. First of all , the idea of a quadriplegic detective indicates that this will be a cerebral tale and indeed that was the case. There is remarkably little sex, violence, cursing, action for action's sake and in a way this makes the task all the more difficult. The author must actually compose sentences and built a plot that are above mere superficiality. <br />This is really three books in one - the first ends with the capture, the second ends with the capture (read and find out) and the third - the story of the female star - concludes this work. It is difficult to describe the  incredible writing and plotting found here. The originality of the tale continues to haunt.	2003-07-29

This work on Alexander gives us a glimpse of the evolution of Fox's writing as well as his insights and conclusions on the subject which are still fresh and surprisingly valid after all these years.<br />As usual, Fox examines and refers to numerous ancient document, customs of the times, differences in languages and somehow makes clear to the reader even the most confusing of subjects, such as the interplay between clans, tribes, family and nationalities. What is so remarkable about this writing is the universal quality of the prose along with the surprising but perfectly valid conclusions.<br />Many historians seem afraid to offer conjecture or opinions but Fox has deliberately gone out on a limb several times - for example, his conclusion that John, the last Gospel penned, was actually the closest to the original sources. In this book we are given a picture of the life and times of one of the most influential person in history - as much for what he stood for as what he accomplished. This is history at its finest.	2003-07-29

In fact, I remember checking it from the library a few days after seeing &quot;The Time Machine&quot;. I was (and am) a fan of time travel tales. Although Asimov has won kudos for his voluminous works over the years, I've always found him somewhat less than appealing. It seems the plot is always for better than the other elements and the romance is, well, unromantic. His characters are often sterile - more portrait than flesh and blood. <BR>But this novel is something different - a work in which the story, characters and action move along to a surprising ending. The pace of the tale is perfection itself, not too rushed or caught up in non-essential happenings. The romance is, as usual, almost chaste in its presentation but surprisingly deep. Rereading it after all these years still brings pleasure even if it is a tad dated. <br />All the paradoxes and what-ifs of time travel are present (the idea of &quot;self-protection&quot; from time changes while in the machine is a stroke of genius). The various twists and turns make for an enjoyable read. Do yourself a favor and get the book.	2003-07-29

I first read it in 1990 and at a second glance recently I noticed how tame the predictions were. Most were consumer-oriented items or fantasy ideas (floating furniture for easy cleaning) but several have become reality - stitches that fade, food wrappings that one can eat, windows that lighten or darken or allow more or less heat into a room. <BR>The organization is simple - a few chapters with small vignettes about the product accompanied by a drawing of same.

The story was allowed to work itself out and it came back on itself in the end - almost like a Mobius strip. <br />The biggest flaw was a common one in mystery writing - all the assumptions of the characters were proved invalid by events to which the reader had no access. In a sense it reminds one of the Soaps where the problem is resolved by the sudden appearance of the unknown twin who has just woken from a 15 year state of amnesia. This is not quite as bad but [CAUTION: STORY NOTES FOLLOW] when the sister suddenly steps out from behind the bush to tell the world the long-hidden truth and John shows up to add his version of the truth about Carly (it DOES sound like a soap) the reader can rightly call \\"Foul\\". <br />Stories with last page resolutions are a dime a dozen and in this case it's sad. The plot was well-conceived even if the main character was memorable if only for his Mr. Rogers-like manner.

They are like a Symphony in which every movement is a variation of the same theme. That being said, each is a good reads. <BR>The author knows the details of the Gospels better than 99% of most preachers. He also knows the historical setting, the language and cultural landscape. While I may or may not agree that a historical person existed from whom a religion emanated, I will agree that there is no evidence (besides the Bible) that a &quot;God&quot; lived in Palestine, rose from the dead and ascended to his new home in the clouds. <br />Wells has made the same arguments numerous times - Paul wrote before the Gospels and knew nothing of a historical Jesus, the Gospels began the biography of the Messiah and each succeeding Gospel not only grew more elaborate but started  further in the past. Mark opened with the Baptism of the adult man, Mathew and Luke at the birth and John at the beginning of time (\\"In the Beginning was the Word...\\").  There are no verifiable historical documents on this person which seems strange if folks were raised from the dead or made to walk or 5,000 people were fed from a small lunch. <br />I should add that Wells is extremely fair and even empathetic to his scholastic foes. He is always respectful, never crude or angry. He even allows them to speak in their own words before demolishing their argument. Get one of the books and enjoy.	2003-07-29

On one side are philosophers, professors, psychologists and ex-churchmen writing storms of \\"myth\\" books only to be countered by archeologists, theologians and divinity professors on the \\"He existed\\" side. Strangely, no other religion has worked so hard nor stressed so fervently the historicity of its founder as Christianity. My own thoughts are that a series of events brought this Jewish sect to its current state - there were certainly no magic mushroom, secret advisor or high level Roman conspiracy to start a new religion. <BR>This \\"non-fiction\\" tale talks of mystical numbers, symbols, Asian run-ins, Buddha and other unlikely characters rolled into an unholy mishmash of conjecture and conclusions. What is this great need for conspiracies, Gnosticism, and Eastern mysticism? At least we doesn't have JESUS taking a vacation to France with Mary Magdalene and child as seems currently in vogue in some circles. <br />As long as there are questions about the historicity of Jesus we will be beset with exaggerated, farfetched tales introducing big behind the scenes moves.

This has only become more apparent after the passing of the &quot;Campaign Finance Reform&quot; Law. Now that soft money is prohibited, those running must appeal to the only sources that can supply the bread - Emily's List, NOW, environmental groups, etc...all with a leftwing perspective.<br />After reading this somewhat depressint tome, two things should be noted. (1) The majority of those on the Left do not consider themselves &quot;liberal&quot; - they view their tilt as moderate (quote unquote). NPR, CNN, CSB, TIME, MSN, ABC, NBC, The TImes (NY, LA, DC) - all hugely influential media outlets shriek at the mere suggestion of a liberal bias and insist they are moderate or even neutral in the ideological war within the nation.  This is due to a variety of reasons - namely their everyday world which is populated by like-minded folks who are well-heeled, well-educated and well to the left of the average American.<br />The second point is that liberals do not have an active &quot;agenda&quot; for bringing a socialist, authoritarian government in power.  Besides, those kinds of governments eventually limit the very debate they now enjoy. Most consider the European model of an orderly, socialist welfare state supporting the arts and keeping everyone more or less the same far superio to our often clumsy, redundant, uneven capitalist culture.  The author makes good read on the silliness  - even anti-Americanism - that permeates the Democratic core but one must allow that even they THINK they are doing what is best.	2003-07-08

Like his other works, Stille makes the non-fiction read like a novel.  He knows just what to stress and what to downplay - in other words, he emphasizes the most important aspects of the &quot;story&quot;.<br />What is so compelling is his &quot;umbrella&quot; approach wherein all components and shades of Italian fascism and Judaism are reviewed.  There was a huge difference between the fascism of Italy and Germany despite their apparent political solidarity. The outstanding difference was that German fascism, unlike that of Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy and Croatia was based on not only adoration of the race but specificially subjugation of the Jews.  It is difficult to understand some of the decisions made but most of us have never had to face the start life and death choices these families encountered.<br />Stille is also an eminently fair man, one who does not condemn fascism while excusing or praising dictatorships of the Left.  He views all forms of state collectivism as inherently evil and this message only increases the force of the narrative.  This is yet another work that should be required reading for high school students.	2003-07-08

I have seen this powers of ten device several times but the one that stands out in my mind is the opening scene of CONTACT that was marred only by the pitiful displays of stupidity heard from the members of the audience.

First, there is too much emphasis on military mechanics - supply lines,  divisions, types of ships, calibers, battalions,etc - and not enough political or ideological intrigues.  Secondly, several of the stories were the exact opposite of what the book suggested - Japan was NOT victorious.  We all know history as it actually happened (at least in our universe according to a certain school of thought) so what I was expecting were stories showing not only how Japan might have won the war but also the aftershocks of such a win.  <br />There was also a paucity of different events.   One story dealt with the Soviet Union, one dealt with India, one with Australia, <BR>and the rest with the Pacific theater.  The Soviet episode was particularly well done because it was so plausible.  The Indian scenario, again highly possible, was eventful but in the end mattered little to the overall outcome. Also, the stories seemed to bypass the atrocities of the war as if it the subject were a little too direct for this audience.<br />Read it from the library if you must.	2003-06-12

The author decries the rapid disappearance of historical landmarks, statues, buildings, art and sculpture - as do most of us. The modern effect whereby observation leads directly to degradation he has named the \\"Heisenberg\\" principle, based on the German scientist's observation that the very act of viewing affects the properties of light. Moisture, oxygen, germs, exposure - all of these are detrimental agents and all are associated with people.<br />He also decries the loss of those items that are elusive - tribal customs now recorded in any medium that have been passed from generation to generation for thousands of years, languages such as Latin, even - and surprisingly - outmoded technology. It is estimated that an enormous collection of data in the National Archives is for all intents and purposes lost since we have lost the technology required for viewing/hearing such data.<br />The differing cultural views on preservation were examined, from the rather recent Western one whereby objects remain in their natural state to the Oriental practice of repeatedly copying (in detail) ancient objects to the oral history of Africa. He rightly recalls that this process has been recurring since mankind recognized ancient works as something different. <br />But this book was also a personal journey since the author became intimately involved with the participants of this saga.  From taking Latin classes in Rome to visiting Chinese and Italian scholars to reviewing the new National Archives and the Vatican Library, this is a \\"hands on\\" book that reads like a labor of love.  <br />Our prosperous culture has created such sins as urban sprawl, deforestation, pollution, crowding, fast food - all of which directly affect not only the objects of the past but our view of the importance of past people's and events. It isthis latter problem that seems all the most disturbing. A close reading reveals that the modern urge to preserve is directly related to the rise of industrialism.<br />What the book lacked were definitive solutions and perhaps that is not by accident.  What is NOT needed are quick fixes or top down solutions.  One of the things he has documented with sorrow is the repetitive nature of socialist dictatorships to screw things up with top-down solutions - whether it be Egypt, China or any number of African countries.  Solutions should be from the ground up and must be in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants of the affected area.<br />Not only cultural but religious views have affected our past. How much knowledge was destroyed when the library in Alexandria was burned or how much religious statuary was destroyed in the first five centuries of Christiandom? And how many hundreds of thousands of paintings and statues have followers of Islam defaced or destroyed in the recent past? Rare is the culture or religion that demonstrates reverence for alien peoples and the products of their culture. <br />The final chapter sums up what we know, what we don't know and where we go from here.  An important book that should grace the libraries of every literate American. Get the book, contemplate its message.	2003-06-10

The book is what one expects - many fine color photos, short bios of the stars, behind the scenes tales of ventures and misadventures...in short, a fan's Nirvana. <br />The book follows a pattern much like the show.  We meet the main players starting with our hostess, Page, and concluding with the two carpenters.  We learn that there is more than meets the eye, that a few things are staged (so what?) and that, all in all, the whole group appears to have a great time besides providing a service for decorationally-deficient folk. The best part about this book is the before and after shots - truly amazing in some cases. <br />I have my own preferences (Vern, Edward) but I stopped watching long ago for any architectural or decorating tips.  I concluded that these makeovers are either (1) too exotic, (2) too tacky or (3) too difficult without professional carpentry, electrical, fabric, artistic advice.  The rooms on this show look ten times better than &quot;While You Were Out&quot; (despite that show's propensity to spend more money) and 100 times better than the tacky &quot;Design on a Dime&quot;.  Get the back, cook some popcorn and tune into the show.	2003-06-10

This novel received such incredible hype that I was almost certain to be let down. You can approach such a book in two ways: Forget reality and have a fun read or try to appreciate the research and idea even if the storyline strays from time to time.<br />The opening was absolutely one of the best I have come read. For a time you are thinking the \\"Thomas Crown Affair\\" in terms of sophisticated presentation. It soon devolves, though, into a Robert Ludlum conspiracy with mad priests, a prototype French detective, unassuming hero, brave heroine, evil religious institutions, ancient mysteries, etc.  You've seen it all before.<br />Brown devotes much energy in regurgitating the whole Jesus- Mary \\"affair\\" [what a double entendre] and the improbable notion that their lineage still exists in none other than (gasp!!) the  damsel who rescued our unassuming hero. Of course, she had no idea. We learn that \\"real\\" religion was once about the \\"goddess\\" but then those crafty males discredited her personhood and gained control of religious institutions.  Male-domination owes far more to physical prowess than nefarious schemes to diss Isis/Athena/Eve or in this case, Mary Magdalene.<br />A recurring problem is the attempt to integrate the action with discussions of pseudo-historical import. What you get is a mad race then a pause for a casual conversation on behind-the-scenes machinations at the Council of Nicene or being held at gunpoint while discussing cryptography in ancient Rome or reviewing the the apparent not-so-secret lives of such luminaries as Da Vinci, Newton, and modern day French presidents.<br />The ending was as bizarre and awful as the beginning was grand.  This is a book I wanted to like.  It had intellectual and artistic appeal, semi-original material and an unlikely hero.  This could have been a shocking, moving book but of course, in the end, nothing is really changed. For a good religious mystery get \\"Gospel\\"\\"Gospel\\"	2003-06-05

The language and sentence structure has always appeared somewhat disjointed, perhaps like the thought processes of her characters.  Still, she says what she wants to say better than almost any modern writer.<br />But delivery is only one element of literature. As important is what is being said and who is saying it.  Rare is the artist who combines a mesmerizing tale with a tantalizing plot, geniune characters and sculptured sentences.  Atwood succeeds in some of these arenas but not in all.  <br />After a little while you find your mind wandering to others of the same genre - Twelve Monkeys, The Stand, On the Beach.  Then there are the always ephemeral characters, floating from present to past to streams of consciousness.  Their lives seem more like shadowy episodes, vignettes to remember, rather than actual lives.  And then there is the diatribe against genetic testing that seems a mantra of so many these days.  Marketing, drugs, advertising, indeed capitalism itself, takes it on the head over and over.  [Oddly, those that blast the market systems rarely offer an alternative, say fascism or tribalism?] <br />The characters are thoroughly detestable, amoral throughout and to the end.  It is like devoting oneself to a cause only to discover that it is all a big act.  I could find no sympathy whatsoever for the sociopathic scientist (what a tritism) or the teller of the saga.  Indeed, this world seemed as weird as others of this type - starvation, world-wide depressions, barbarism, starvation, war, epidimics,yet....yet science continues merrily onward as if everything were AOK.  Some of the reading was interesting, some of it informative, but on the whole, it does not compare to the Handmaid's Tale.	2003-06-02

Let's face it - it's a fun book!  Ignore the total lack of even a pretense at scientific theory or explanation about the ability.  Ignore the amorality of a novel in which the hero robs banks and says it's OK because they lose money in accounting errors or a mother who leaves her son with an abusive father. Ignore the less than adult plot, stilted dialogue and sudden turn of events that make about as much sense as, well, \\"jumping\\".  <br />This is one of those books that screams \\"MADE FOR THE MOVIES\\".  It literally reeks of trendiness - the innocent, pushed around geek who becomes a superhero, the chance meeting with the older woman who captures his heart, the bravura of his tricks and the ingenuity of his fight against terrorists (don't ask). About the only character \\"development\\" was the young hero's exposure to the world outside Smallville and his increasing sophistication and jaded look at his former life. The book has a terrible ending but by then you are tired of all the fights and chases. Get the book and reserve a couple of hours for a good read.	2003-05-28

In here they go about their appointed or elected tasks all the while spilling their guts to Woodward. History will judge George Bush on one thing:  His decision to involve the U.S in an ongoing world-wide war against not only terrorists but terrorist states supporting them either directly or indirectly.  This idea seemingly pops into view in the midst of the chaos surrounding 911 and it sets the stage for world events for the next decade.<br />Frankly, I prefer Bush's managerial style over the incoherent, jumbled style of his predecesor that has been described in detail by former administration insiders. The managerial style is particularly effective in crisis mode which, after reading the book, it seems Washington is in 24/7. Depending on your point of view, it is either an affirmation or confirmation of previously-held personal opinions. <br />Bush is seen as resolute, steady, able but not brilliant, open to suggestions.  He can also be seen as unbending, relying too much on deputies and merely selecting from an array of options. Others appear as expected. Cheney, unconcerned with celebrity, always looking for lurking dangers. Rice, the Great Compromiser, perhaps the only one who knows the \\"real\\" George Bush.  Tenet is the administrator, a voice crying in the wildernerness. Rumsfeld and Powell duke it out again and again, both behind the scenes and in public.  Yet when push came to shove on Iraq, Powell jumped on board, thoroughy disgusted with the broken French promises as Bash or Cheney.<br />The trouble I had with the book was its tone as a documentary rather than a story.  We read about events, facts, alleged conversations, overheard telephone calls, political mutterings but see little analysis or conclusions.  One gets the idea that Powell is the hidden Savior of the administration and indeed, his stature and prominence seem to grow as one progresses into the story.Still, one must give kudos to the author for getting the story.	2003-05-28

It cetainly deserves all the kudos sent its way. It is reminscent of Dennis Overbye's &quot;Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos&quot; (which the author quotes frequently) in its storytelling power and its ability to gather science and scientist under one roof. Cosmos focuses on cosmology whereas &quot;A Short History&quot; deals with, well, everything. It is not on the same plane as Daniel Boorstin's &quot;The Discoveres&quot; but then each author had a different agenda.<br />The book succeeds on three levels. Organization of material is truly brilliant. Leaping from such diverse subjects as techtonic plates to stars to quarks to evolution is difficult and can bog down into a boring recitation of facts.  This is prevented by the introduction of the second outstanding feature:  Biographies and histories.  We read about the famous, the infamous and the not-so-famous.  We learn the history behind a current theory and excellent, layman-level explanations.<br />The third feature is a rare one in a non-fiction work - humor.  The language is quirky, almost idiomatic. It is always immensely simulating and pleasurable.  The sheer mass of facts could fill a college lecture series for ten semesters. There is an audacity in the challenge the author undertakes that one can only admire. It is difficult to find a single fault with the book with the possible exception of a lack of drawings or pictures.  <br />Still, the descriptions are so rich and imaginative that perhaps a picture would be redundant.  A troubling thought occurred while reading that most Americans would not grasp 1/100 of the ideas discussed in this work nor would they care to try and learn. Therefore, we can only hope that Bryson continues the task of both educating and entertaining us.	2003-05-28

Discounting the high rate of suicide and divorce in Utah, Mormon beliefs are based on Joseph Smith's wild (delusional to be charitable) claims of  golden plates, magic glasses, heavenly babies, Egyptian writing in New York (???) and other such oddities. Despite the fact that the Book of Mormons has undergone literally thousands of edits (its prophecy and history are bogus) it is still revered as the WORD by the faithful.<br />This book presents an excellent look at the cutthroat politics of Mormonism, the fear of undisclosed revelations and the lengths to which the church will go to keep such revelations from being brought to light.  The loss of faith by a Mormon missionary set in motion a chain of events that culminated in the taking of human life. What is particularly sad is that all this evil was so unnecessary.<br />The fear here is that newly discovered documents showed Smith as a charlatan and the Book of Mormons as phony. Belief systems by necessity ignore scientific and historical evidence contrary to their teachings.  DNA demonstrates that Indians are of Asian - not Jewish - origins. Archeologists have never found a scintilla of evidence of advanced Indian civilizations.  Anthropologists have dismissed stories of writing, libraries and exotic animals as sheer fantasy.  If these finding have not bothered the Faithful why did church leaders think a few old papers would be any different?<br /><br />This is an engrossing mystery and its setting makes it all the more enticing.  The research was stunning, particularly the disclosures into the ins and outs of church life. Buy a copy today.	2003-05-15

That said, I marvel at the mental gerrymandering required to accept even basic tenets of Mormonism. The author attempts to move past the embarrassing tales surrounding the origins of this movement or the Egyptian, occult and racist influences.  <br />A casual perusal reveals such jewels as Indian culture descended from the Jews, golden tablets, magic glasses, divining stones, Egyptian writing, drop-ins from heavenly beings and bizarre ideas like pre-existing \\"soul babies\\", baptism for the dead and every man is a god. It's right out of Santa Conquers Mars. But these are not what is stressed by the faithful. Instead smiling, wholesome families is the drawing card. Theology and history are relegated to the bottom of the heap.   <br />If archeological and linguistic studies have proven humiliating, theological efforts have been non-existent. Unlike Christianity, Judaism or even Islam, Mormon theology has never undergone critical study.  For one, hardly anyone takes the Book of Mormon seriously.  It's sagas have been disproved by DNA, archeology and anthropolgy; whole sections are lifted from the Bible.  (Smith's hilariously bad grammar was weeded out after several drafts.)  Then again, the \\"theology\\" is ever-changing. Polygamy is in then it's out; dark skin is out then it's in; Occult figures appear and disappear; angels, Indians, Egyptians, Jews, gods after death, soul babies conversing - all racing in and out of pseudo-histories and beliefs in ferment...the mind reels. <BR>  <BR>Dana tries to bypass all this with semi-serious explications of questions that would be raised by \\"thinking\\" Mormons. In fact, they have been raised by practically every theologian and scientist not connected with the Mormon Church.   Many of these questions are finessed via answers like.  \\"..the best studies of the Church indicate\\"  or quotes from scientists or thinkers from the Church. Needlessto say, one can easily predict the answer just by reading the question.  The whole exercise is reminiscent of evangelists attempting to \\"prove\\" the Scriptures by quoting the Bible - a classic tautological exercise frequently employed by Mormons. Good try but no cigar.<br />Those who search for the earthly origin of their faith are bound to find disappointment and frustration. All major religions have mythic beginnings, have borrowed from surrounding cultures and belief systems and gradually rewritten the message received from on high until the kinks are worked out.  Mormons have just begun the process and have a lot more kinks to go.	2003-05-14

Were you aware that deep and dark conspiracies are at work even AS WE SPEAK (or in this case, write)? If not, then this is not the book for you. Here you will find a maze of opinions, bad science and a few factoids along with the latest in urban myths and all the prerequisites of Conspiracy 101. These are mixed, spun and spit out in a random fashion, chillingly presented with the conviction of the insane. You know the type, a statement about evolution followed by one on UFOs right before we get to the Holohoax, then suddenly a word on communism before reviewing the implications and reasons of the French Revolution.<br />You try to take it seriously but when he begins darkly about the  Rothchilds, Trilateral Commission ..., you glance around furtively hoping nobody recognizes you with this crazy thing. Then again, maybe you are looking for those aliens who seem to be yet another component of Icke's own \\"philosophy\\".  <br />The real problem - besides the nuttiness of the whole venture - is the inability to separate personal beliefs(impossible to define) with a philosphy of history straight from the annals of Weirdo University.  The author repeatedly tries to sound authoritative and only succeeds in making an ass of himself. What can one say about someone who purports to have discovered the truth of the ages and decides to parcel it out in multi-volume sets to little ole' you and me? About as much as you'd say to someone who tries to seriously connect spirituality, angels, aliens and Nazis. <br />The saddest aspect is the desperate belief some people place in such claptrap. These are folks so disparing of finding a way to  lift the fog from their minds and make sense of the world that they continuously jump at the next thing around the bend. Just for the record, this is not that thing.  Avoid like the plague.	2003-05-13

He is demanding with particular attention to ingredients and details,  the kind that the general public normally overlooks. This latest creation reads like a &quot;Who's Who&quot; of culinary New York with many tales of all the ins and outs of the profession. <br />We read of decor, history, New York gossip, Brookly politics, Manhatten celebs and the like.  But in the end, he writes about what he loves most - the dining experience and food in all its splendid varieties. The author is demanding, not accepting dirty forks, wrong orders, poor service, snobbery or laziness. But praise, when given, is bountiful and sincere. Like all of us he has preferences, his being French, seafood, fresh seasonings, elagant but comfortable surroundings and professional but friendly personnel.  <br />Restaurants are listed alphabetically but other lists are also included - by type, cost, rating.  As in his other books, the writing is polished, knowledgable and wicked (around NY he is called Simon &quot;Bitchky&quot;).  I almost fell out of my chair with some of the reviews, the lower the rating the &quot;better&quot; (or worse depending on your point of view) the review.  His top ratings are reserved for only the finest.  There is always Lutece, not a restaurant but a place of gourmand worship.  He eventaully collaborated with the owner on &quot;The Lutece Cookbook,&quot; an instant best seller.<br />Buy this book even if you don't plan a trip to the Big Apple.	2003-04-28

Perhaps his best writing was contained in his meditation on his beloved France.  Braudel is at his best explicating to the educated masses. Notice the operative word &quot;educated&quot;.  These books are by no means highbrow but they do demand the full attention of the reader. <br />Capitalism is the only modern economic system that is not  directed from an autocratic bureaucracy.  Fascism, socialism, communism, tribalism and to a large extent, social welfare states continue to suppress their full potential and for that reason the economic collosus that is America continues its dominance.  Ironically, despite European and intellectual jabs at the U.S. for its roughness and backward culture, it is not primarily in material goods that we excel but in intellectual  accomplishments - research, development, scientific, the arts. One need only witness the annual parade of Americans each year receiving Nobels.<br />Braudel explains that capitalism - and this is important - rose from the individual to the group, not top down. He traces an incredible path of changing habits, personal practices, slowly emerging markets and how the whole became greater than the sum of its parts.  What is unique about this economic revolution is that it was NOT directed according to the dictates of academic theory or the musings of an economic prophet.  It rose because it fit with the emerging modern civilization that was beginning in Europe (and would soon conquer the world).   <br />The writing is masterly (wonderful translation); one is pulled along as if by a large wave.  The effect is overwhelming when one considers the vestigal beginnings and the pinnacle of success that is the Western world...this is a must for serious thinkers.	2003-04-01

This time it's the real thing for Bond, but as anyone who knows this genre well, it is only fleeting passions. After all, how could a married man carry on like we all expect (and hope) he does.<br />SPECTRE is back again, Blofield as evil as ever.  After all the trials trials and tribulations, the final victory is sweet. This of course makes the ending all the more shocking and at the same time, \\"right\\".

The latter is the real controversy in history.  Columbus is not admired (or hated) due to who he was or even what he did but over the consequences of his actions - discovery of a New World or destroyer of an old one.  History has always been affected by politics and prejudice but ideology has become paramount lately. Perhaps the most infuriating development is the absurd tendency to view earlier times and individuals through a modern, politically correct prism. <br />This book reminds me of NPR in its relentlessly ideological approach to all issues...every event is politicized. Ideology is unceasing, benefits of the doubt are never extended, traditional ways are overlooked and after wading through harangues and scoldings in what is essentially an angry indictment of this nation one wonders why we have not had continual rebellions.<br />Like NPR, he LOVES to bash the South. NPR rails against (take your pick) racism, poverty, illiteracy and/or evangelicalism.  Loewen evokes memories of the Confederacy and slavery almost as a mantra.  Fanciful and unrealistic Civil War memorials exist in many place but is that immoral?  Professional nincompoops wanted to erect a politically correct monument to 911 (the raising of the flag) which would have been historically inaccurate but not immoral.   <br />The author has a tendency to overemphasize certain events just to make his point - akin to Chomsky's connecting random events to prove his dialectic.  Some interesting points are made but ALWAYS through this contemporary prism of judgement.  Were statues and/or painting skewed to express the view of the artist?  Of course they were because that is a human tendency.  Jesus is portrayed as a long-haired European man, Washington, in the enormous status in the Museum of American History has become a Roman emperor because thesculptor admired the classic period. Even if some events were misinterpreted is that an indictment? <br />No matter how one approaches the history of our country, there is one inescapable fact:  To millions around the world, this land with all its inconsistencies, prejudices and faults has been perceived as heaven on earth since its inception. And even in the worst moments, there has never been even a trickle - much less an exodus - of citizens desiring life in another nation.	2003-03-29

It's a spy thriller wherein our imagination is supposed to run wild.  Ludlum excels at creating moods and the slightly offbeat murky one here perfectly matches the story.  <br />We begin to wonder who the man is, why he is where he is and what his real mission will turn out to be.  Although this may be heretical, I actually thought the TV miniseries starring Richard Chamberlain and Jacelyn Smith was far superior to the movie version with Matt Damon.  When I first heard the casting for both versions I was disappointed.  But Chamberlain was a perfect Bourne, a chameleon, relentless and dramatic.  Smith was much more than a pretty face - she was a great costar.<br />The newest version suffers from an ailment afflicting cinema across the board - the worship of youth.  Matt Damon is not nearly as mature or old as the Jason Bourne in the book. Perhaps that's why those who do not read books enjoyed this version.<br />My only complaint is one that I have with other authors, but particularly Ludlum.  He has been copied so often and with such effectiveness that to be different his novels have grown longer and longer and longer.  I know this story could have used a good editor but I can't think of any parts I would want to cut.	2003-03-29

Both were self-made men, both very private, both happily married and both dealt with subjects regarded as (even today) taboo.  Both men sensed that the underlying foundation of modern culture were edifices rising from our evolutionary psychology - love, death, sex, religion, power, dreams...the things that make us human.<br />The two were quintessentially Americans, optimistic, willing to tackle difficult and uncomfortable subjects.  They recognized the power of the spirit and its overwhelming influence on our very being.  Vardis's Testament of Man purposely flows along a Judeo-Christian path. Heinlein alludes both directly (\\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\", \\"Job\\") and indirectly (\\"I will fear no evil\\", \\"Number of the Beast\\") to the world of the spirit.<br />This is yet another of the Lazurus Long series, each quirky and totally unique. We are provided a brilliant soliloquy of eternal life, an old man remembering (and enjoying) his youth. It is almost as if Heinlein had projected himself into the role of Lazurus.  He touches on such subjects as religion, incest, love,<BR>politics, metaphysics and the joy of being human.  The humanity of his writing explains its success and approachability.  Read this along with the others in the series.	2003-03-28

The only other comparison would be the extraordinary number of scientists from tiny Scotland that almost single-handedly began the Industrial Revolution. Popper and friends were Renaissance men, masterful in numerous subjects, at ease in a laboratory, classroom or lecture hall. <br />They were rationalists of a specific kind.  Not for them, the ramblings of a street preacher, social &quot;activist&quot; or leader of mass movements.  Instead their actions were didactic, in the cause of something greater.  Popper served as gadfly, professor, mathematician, scientist, philosopher and could be considered a  spokesman for the groups.  His life in Europe was remarkable for what was accomplished - oh, to have a such an inquiring, multi-faceted mind!!<br />This book is perhaps more approachable that some of his others. The title says it all; it is the story of the evolution of an intellect that seemed to retain its core.  He was interested in so many things and so many areas that all his works are to some degrees syntheses of his interests.   Whether he is admiring the logic of scientific discovery or the illogic of taxes, he is brillant, informative and endearing.   The intellectual battles are here for all to see (and choose sides).  He emerges with not only his mind but his soul intact.	2003-03-27

The man was a wonder himself.  From the classically liberal European tradition of the turn of the century, he fought valiantly to establish economics on a rational basis with rules, laws, and theorems - all based on \\"human action\\". He builds an elaborate system from axioms to dizzying heights of eloquent logic. <br />He is important not because he championed material wealth - Marx did that - but for his recognition that this wealth rested on an edifice composed by people acting in their own self interest. Despite his dry style and subject matter, his writings were paeans of praise for humanity's soul. His theories (naturally) involved a synthesis with other arenas, notably  philosophy, politics, morality, government, and aesthetics.<br />It is on the subject of human freedom that he made an indelible mark by demonstrating that laissez-faire capitalism is not only the best in terms of economics but also by far the one that bequeaths the greatest freedom to the individual. It has been stated before - and was repeated in \\"Human Action\\" - there is a direct correlation between a nation's economic freedom and its political freedom. It is no accident that the US, Europe and some Southeast Asian nations are not only the richest in terms of material wealth but also in terms of human potential.  What astonishes one are the public pronouncements from those who willingly choose systems that limit both wealth and freedom.<br />While professional nitwits continue to blast Western culture, millions risk life and limb just to reach our shore.  Am I the only one noticing the one-way flow of traffic from such vacation paradises as Cuba, Vietnam, China, Sudan and Syria?  This book should be required reading in all high school  - but then that would be a coercive action that the author would disdain.	2003-03-27

I read it straight through at one setting.  It is the story of a lonely sport, rowing, and the men who endure incredible pain and sacrifice just for the chance of competition.  These are not men who party at night, sleep late and wave to the cameras.  No, they are dedicated, serious students who have been called to wield an oar.<br />The author shares a trait with Paul Johnson and Daniel Boorstin- that is the art of intertwining personal tales within the plot of his story in such a way that both complement each other. If you want a good beach book, this is the one.	2003-03-27

One, written prior to the fall of communism, placed such figures as Lenin, Marx, Mao and others higher on the list. After the dust settled, he reworked the list, dropping them a few (or several) notches.<BR>This is a great gift book and an even better bathroom read. It's rather compact chapters are easily perused and follow a pattern: <BR>A brief introduction, a short, intelligent biography, many times introducing new, unknown elements, then a summation and reasons for the ranking.<br />As other reviewer have stated, the listing is controversial but given circumstances in the modern world, incredibly prescient. (He ranks Mohammed as most influential.)  As should be, the philosophers and religious leaders are near the top.  One finds  <BR>a general assortment of explorers, scientist, social movement leaders, royalty and thinkers.  All in all, an excellent book.	2003-03-21

He served his country well at numerous positions from the Admiralty to MP (from multiple areas and multiple parties) to 10 Downing Street.  But most of all, he is known by his unflagging strength and brilliant, fortifying speeches during WWII.  <br />Today he is quoted by those who think intervention is the only sound policy in response to potential terror.  He was prescient in his warnings about the necessity of confronting evil but the nation turned its head (and suffered the consequences). This account, in his inimitable style, is a masterly work.  He traces the reasons for conflict, the beginnings, the internal political machinations, the movers and shakers, the battles, the trials and the final push.<br />The work succeeds on three levels: Historical, literary and personal.  It should be required reading for students today who would learn more history between these pages than in any boring class.  Again and again he stresses that the past must be studied if future errors are to be avoided and that past actions determine/predicate future activities.  For him, it was easy to see the logical outcome of Hitler's ever-spreading land grab. His old-fashioned morality spoke to him, telling him that it was quite silly to expect rulers who terrorize their own people to uphold internation laws of civility.<br />In the end, he issued a warning about Soviet Russia who he had always regarded with contempt. His \\"iron curtain\\" reference became an everyday term for the next fifty years.  Buy these works for someone you care about  - or give yourself a treat.	2003-03-19

Not only are they informative and interesting, they are also beautiful with color illustrations, diagrams, maps,etc.<BR>DO NOT GET THE PAPERBACK VERSIONS!!<br />In this work, one explores the Solar System with the help of incredible shots from Voyager, the pair of exploring satellites launched some time ago.  These spacecraft, using gravity as both a booster and tether, visited each planet, sending information so vast and so unexpected that theorists are just now beginning to understand all the ramifications.<br />The origins of our planetary system is explained brilliantly with diagrams and color paintings.  Then we take a tour of each planet and learn a lot more than Mars is red and Saturn has rings.  The uniqueness of each world can be explored in this book so take your time and enjoy.	2003-03-18

While 99.99% of all world terrorism has its roots in the Middle East, it has become a worldwide phenomenon.<br />Even more important than the barbarous acts, though, is the development of a framework within which one both justifies and excuses terrorism.  Never before has the claim been made that it is morally permissible to kill innocent men, women and children for any reason.  Never before have there been so many willing not only to forgive but also to forget these deeds done in the name of an esoteric idea.<br />Perhaps the most important development, and one discussed in detail, is the merging of Islamic fundamentalism and the Left throughout the world.  In a sense it was inevitable:  Both are virulently anti-Western, both advocate violence and both support <BR>- and get support from -  totalitarian regimes. Mainly due to the identification with the USSR and its support for Arab causes, the Left has moved steadily into an anti-Israeli/Jewish pro-Arab/Palestinian stand. One can trace both the physical evolution of Palestinian terror groups (unorganized local groups to world network) and ideological evolution (from local issues to global terrorist concerns). This is most evident in Europe, especially France and Germany. The two  share a dubious honor:  France is the intellectual home of modern anti-Semitism and Germany is where the logical fruition of these \\"ideas\\" was practiced.<br />Another danger of terrorism is that of disproportion.  The number of people required for maximum damage has been steadily dwindling - from mass armies, to small units, to spies to ordinary individuals. Terrorism thrives because of this disproportionate power. This is a disturbing yet satisfying read and the author is to be commended for excellent research.	2003-03-18

In &quot;Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos&quot; we read about the theory and history of cosmology along with the personal travails of one scientist an the bitter infighting among all scientists.  In this non-novel novel, we are immersed into the nascent world of relativity.  From its theoretical origins [thinking outside the box] we are given a review of classical physics and the theories /  illuminations of the greatest scientist of this age.<br />The scientific story advances within the framework of Einstein's personal life.  It is rare that an individual can succeed in all areas of endeavor, be they love, work or play.  One feels some disappointment with his personal travails and while he may appear cold or disloyal, many times great people sublimate their relationships to their passion.<br />Unlike other intellectuals whose personal lives were a total repudiation of the their professed ideology (Marx was an utter slackard, Hellman and Brecht were serial liars, Fuller switched positions with the wind, scolding the world when they began to ignore his newest mania),  Einstein never tried to impose a social scheme on others.  He loved quietly as one should and made his mistakes in private, again as one should.  All in all, a successful work.	2003-03-16

He has successfully debunked New Age spokemen, paranormal \\"scientists\\", ESP, UFO, psychokensis claims, Uri Geller...and done so with a sense of humor and humanity.  Here, though, Randi is angry.  It is not that the people who fall for these charlatans are any worse than the Hollywood morons who attend \\"channeling\\" session. No, what makes him so furious is that these hypocrites (faith healers, not Hollywood morons) play on the most vulnerable of our society in the most vulnerable area of their lives.<br />He recounts the behind-the-scenes misadventures of these \\"men of God\\" (and their women folk).  I am sure at one time or another we have all seen some guy in a Gucci suit standing before a crowd of country bumpkins proclaiming that if they believed (and gave) they could be HEALED.   Randi tells of the actors who work this pitiful bunch, the hidden microphones, the power of the Big Lie.  And all of this is done in the name of religion!<br />Miracles, the act of suspending the laws of nature, may occur. But Randi contends that they cannot be reproduced in a closed environment following normal scientific procedures.  When faced with having to perform under these circumstances the results are as one can imagine.  If you want to confirm what you always thought then rush out and get this book.	2003-03-16

Covering subjects as varied as gravity, cells, sound, vision and motion, these works offer a clarity of scientific exposition rarely encountered.  <br />Many of these books are quite approachable (Powers of Ten), some are quite technical and require a knowledgable background of the subject.  &quot;The Second Law&quot; falls somewhere between the two.  The first problem is understanding what the second law says. The second problem is relating this to the universe of reality. <br />Perhaps the greatest problem in relating current scientific to the average layman is that the subject matter is so arcane and sophisticated.  Most non-scientists (particularly considering the dismal state of science in public education) cannot grasp either the theory, mechanics or ramifications of that research - nor do they want to.  The hardback book is beautiful with many illustrations. The writing is technically superb and at the same time literate and approachable.  If you are a serious student of the way the universe operates, get this book.	2003-03-16

The book was a hoot (much better than the movie) in its depiction of Bill Clinton as a fascinatingly, repellant character. I suppose to prove that he really didn't mean all those snide, mean things he's been telling everyone who'd listen that he really likes the guy.<br />If anyone is a natural polician it is the man from Hope.  Even in the depths of his scandals (his falling asleep during hours of phone sex was the latest headline) I told my boys that he epitomized the American dream.  Klein agreed.  Where else can a poor chubby boy from the most backward state in the Union with a dysfunctional family become the leader of the country?  <br />His native intelligence and curiousity was both a curse and a blessing. It enabled him to succinctly explain his point of view and simultaneously become paralyzed in analysis. Klein shows the good and the bad - there was plenty of both.  He always wanted to do great things but personal habits, ingrained years before, kept destroying that goal.  His daily obscenity-filled tirades have been described by aides; his lifelong filandering has been documented but almost as well known is his deep religious faith.<br />Klein briefly discusses the enigma of Hillary who both made and broke the man.  In the end, one is left wondering what Bill Clinton believes - his wide-ranging interests led him into new and different directions while his political genius recognized the latest trend for political use.  He was the Natural - an excellent title and description.	2003-03-14

He tended toward the miniature as he grew older, honing these to a mirror finish. This collection contains a number of poems from different periods of his life.<br />They are not &quot;Mary had a little lamb&quot; type, the mediocore lines of an Alan Ginzberg or the blank verse of T.S Elliot.  Each poem carries an apt titled, the language always rich and correct.  These are not words of (necessarily) wisdom nor are they deep, obtuse thoughts.  Rather they are like his prose, easygoing, informative and flowing.  Bradbury's poems have an internal rhthym with a fine meter.<br />He, unlike many writers of the modern age, does not suffer from xenomania.  He was, like Ben Franklin, the quintessential countryman, self-accomplished, hard-working and gifted in both practicality and style.  I have one of the first books published on Disney's EPCOT; Bradbury wrote the introduction.  This was before the experiment became mired in politics, commercialism, triteness and showmanship.  His words captured the moment of both the place and the era...so do his poems.	2003-03-14
1194057:US	52706646	R3HD9NPF6FIUL1	0465001769	492085239	What Liberal Media?: The Truth About Bias and the News	Books	3	15	28	N	N	In your heart you know he's "right"	This is an angry tome, written with conviction and passion. It falls short of the mark but not for the reasons most folks would think. There are actually two \\"mainstream\\" media.  One consists of the NY Times, LA Times, Washington Post, ABC, CBS, NBC, NPR, Time, Newsweek, CNN, Fox and MSNBC. The other consists of media from the \\"Fly-over\\" zone, radio talk shows, local newspapers, parochial magazines, etc.  <br />The first group (\\"Big Media\\") has enormous powers of influence and advocacy. They are heard and read around the world; they are quoted liberally if you pardon the pun.  And, with the exception of FOX, they lean to the Left and favor the Democratic Party. I cannot understand why this should be shameful but it is denied routinely with vehemence, as if it were immoral. Instead we hear that they are \\"independent\\" without an opinion, - intellectual dishonesty at its best (or worst).<br />The author contends that the media is more conservative than liberal and I would have to agree.  What is not stressed is the disproportionate influence of the \\"Big Media\\" compared to the second tier.  There are a boatload of \\"facts\\", some good, some strained - air time, number of stations, subject matter, etc... Corporate influence, a bugaboo to the Left, is discussed in depth. I dare say, though, he would be wont to criticize Ben & Jerrys, Hip Hop recording studios or Wall Street firms run by former Clinton aides. <br />The author fails to address the main issue - that rightly or wrongly, the American people consider Big Media liberal by overwhelming margins (4-1 in the last survey I saw). Here's the point:  Big Media mistakenly consider themselves moderate because they are surrounded by like-minded people. The scary thing is not a liberal cabal but but instead a uniformity of thought on almost every issue from abortion to gay rights to the environment to Iraq. Everyone has opinions but few have the power to promulgate those opinions under the guise of reporting the news. One reason for the amazing success of the conservative FOX is the realization that there is an alternative to the views held by Big Media.	2003-03-14

The once-grand past of Islam continues to shine and its brillance has blinded those in the region of a new reality.  <br />Oren adds complexity to an event that seems simple and direct. Considering the circumstances, war was an inevitability. The problem was compounded by Cold War rivalry and regional enmities. Arab governments, either royal (Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Emirates) or military (Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Libya), sought to retain support from the Arab \\"street\\" by invoking the \\"Jew\\" card and regaling past glories.<br />But, as the Soviet embassador to the UN said, they can't work together even when their own vital interests are at stake. In the game of \\"who's bad?\\" Syria taunts Egypt for even considering peace, Egypt attacks Jordan for Western backing, Jordan rails against Syria and Iraq, Iraq tries to topple the Saudi kingdom. Provoked, Nasser ordered UN guards out, began a military buildup in the Sinai and closed the only sea port of Israel. The actions grew bolder as the cries from the \\"street\\" grew louder.   <br />Israel, surrounded and isolated, struck hard with terrifying results. Arab capitals spoke of great victories and Arab leaders casually lied to each other: Egypt was advancing, Jordan holding her own, Syria was \\"advancing to Tel Aviv\\". The Soviets, who wanted the Mideast at a constant broil, were desperate to stop the war but had to fight their own client. <br />The aftermath was as telling as the war itself.  Jews in Arab countries were killed, arrested or banished while Israel helped rebuild hundreds of Arab homes on the West Bank.  There is a stark difference of interpretations between Israel and Arabs over the meaning of this war.  Israel thought Arabs would now recognize that it could not be defeated and would come to terms.  Arabs, on the other hand, thought of this as only one phase of an extended war of extermination of the Jewish state. <BR>Any attempt at accomodation is seen as an act of both religious and cultural betrayal.  The road is rocky.	2003-03-14

Two problems rear their head: (1) Soviet collectivism showed the same virulence of Jews as Hitlerian collectivism and (2) what is it mean to be \\"left\\" or \\"right\\"? One assumes that \\"left\\" refers to collectivism and group rights -whether Soviet adulation of economic status or Nazi worship of race.  \\"Right\\" has usually been thought of as tending toward the individual which pretty much explains why the U.S. is and always has been a moderately conservative nation. <br />The slights and prejudices of Ivy League WASPS have given way to screams of hatred from \\"radicals\\".  One cannot fail to notice a peculiarity of today's peace marches:  the anti-war banners are almost smothered in the sea of anti-Israeli/pro-Arab flags / red radical flags.  The transformation of the Left into an anti-Israeli/anti-Jewish (they are virtually the same) had its beginnings in Europe.<br />Th author notes this and adds that this is nowhere more evident than France, the origin of intellectual anti-Semitism. It is certainly not surprising - the vast majority of persecution occurred under Catholic and Orthodox rule and even if France has gone the way of paganism, cultural fossils remain. The longtime connection between Jews and moneyed interests almost guaranteed persecution in the Soviet empire and now that Socialism is the god of Europe, the Left has found a natural enemy.<br />After all, Israel is not only pro-Western but pro-capitalist, two marks against it in the eyes of the ideologue.  The odd thing is that Jews have for centuries been on the liberal side of almost every social issue. As with most issues though, when one disagrees with the Left it is not just wrong but evil. Few thought they would witness Leftists in Europe marching for Arab dictatorships over the one democracy in the region.  This book explains why this has occurred and why the media is so silent about it.	2003-03-11

But this is one is not graphic - just suggestive.  The idea was a good one...man loses daughter (rather her mind) to some creep who doesn't deserve a another day of life much less his proverbial day in court.  The hero, a lawyer, does something we all dream about - he begins a journey of justice, giving the creatures who commit these deeds a one-way trip to the next life.<br />During the course of the book we learn his wife left him, his daughter is catatonic and he has fallen for a friend of the family.  The author tried to have two stories of equal import that arched and joined into a predictable conclusion.  The trouble was that neither of these was developed smoothly. The writing was choppy, the hero continually breaking down or going slightly mad at the drop of the hat. <br />The heroine, an overworked FBI investigator/mother, has one of those typical book marriages - enthralled with her job, guilty as hell, rolypoly hubby who grows bitter, two cute kids. She is finally assigned the case of finding the vigilante and, of course, the finale is a mixed up meeting of heroine, hero, hubby, children, bad boss, bad guy who killed daughter and bad guy's boy friend.  Hero goes to trial, gets out shortly and lives happily ever after with new love.<br />There is not a lot of depth here (easy one night read) but in the right hands this could be a barn burner.	2003-03-10

I loved the first book both for the tremendous story and the the fascinating characters. <br />I expected the story to be a continuation of the first one it is true that the theme and plot evolved from one book to the other. Still, one faces new characters and new situations.  The author explores several universal themes in this pair of tales - what is \\"life\\", what happens to conditions such as death and birth when life is eternal, what does it mean to be living, the relation / conflict between science and religion, the question of love in an increasingly sterile society and last, but certainly not least, the future of mankind.  Each of these by themselves constitue enough material for a whole shelf of books, yet these conflicts are not only interpreted with aplomb but also mostly answered.<br />The love story is an added bonus, a crown topping an already superb saga.  Character development is one of Danver's strong points yet it is so imperceptible that one scarcely realizes the changes.  The best adjective one can use to describe this series is \\"satisfying\\". A true achievement.	2003-03-10

Even more interesting is how little we actually know for sure - his parentage, city of birth, actual teaching or why he was killed. Without any external historical references, we are left with only the New Testament, a series of writings composed from 40-65 years after Jesus's death, none by eye witnesses.<br />Sheehan has attempted to explain how a Jewish peasant evolved into God within a century. He starts, like many Bibical critics, noting the discrepancy between date of composition and order of presentation in the New Testament.  Paul's letters came first, then Mark, Matthew, Luke/Acts and finally John. One can easily trace the growth in stature following this line of evidence.<br />Paul knew nothing of the physical man.  He never believed in a physical resurrection, preaching that some raised did not have a physical body like us but a spiritual one. No mention of God's son or being a God.<br />Mark (next) starts with the adult man. Luke and Matthew, written some 80 years after his birth contained the Nativity and early life.  John, completed  toward the end of the century opens with the stirring \\"In the Beginning was the Word\\".  We are at the beginning of the Universe and there is Jesus and God as one.<br />We follow the evolutionary streams as words are changed, ideas added, ancient prophecies are quoted out of context and at last Jesus is judged God by a political convocation.  Interesting, Sheehan finds all the talk of a coming Kingdom as the kernel of the teachings.  This is Jesus's revolutionary message - that the kingdom of God is internal and can exist now, not some mystical future.  That's a stretch but still a good read.	2003-03-07

There is no comparison between being a zoned-out zombie and perking up to a Pepsi or cafe latte.  Those who don't see this need a reality check. In fact, I am sipping a Dr. Pepper as I write (and, I might add, without a twinge of guilt.)<br />Caffiene is a modern development, especially the refining and concentrating of its powers.  It emerged from the shadows in the Industrial Society and was indispensable in the conversion from a society of alcholic stupor to one that would revolutionize the world.  The origins of both coffee and tea are quite similar - both being recognized for their medicinal purposes.  Both had strong religious opposition (Islamic and Catholic) and both developed rituals and sites dedicated to the imbibing of the liquid.<br />Coffee and a few other naturally occurring plants also contain caffiene.  The scientific section was too advanced for 99% of the readers- more like a chemistry treatise - but the history of <BR>this ubiquitous drug was exciting and learned.  The story of the rise of coffee houses, their political and social importance and the tale of the origins of afternoon \\"Tea\\" were both well done/ The history of soft drinks was an eye-opener as well. The book contains several illustrations and is best enjoyed with a hot cup of Costa Rican Arabica beaned coffee (not pre-ground).	2003-03-07

The reason is they cannot imagine his imaginings.  To them, the United States is the greatest country in the world bar none, the most caring, the one with the most opportunity, its culture is more diverse and open than any other and it is, above all, eminently practical and can-do.<br />Now those attributes may not be attractive to academia but they are what has sustained us for over 200 years. Chomsky has left a once-promising career and moved into his own fantasy world lock, stock and barrel.  In the Universe according to Noam freedom is oppression, slavery is liberty and happiness is stupidity.  It never fails to amaze me that the folks who protest our Western culture, its pluralism, freedom, democracy, solutions through ballot and not violence, diversity, would not be allowed to open their trap in a society run according to their dictates.<br />People say \\"this is not a blame America\\" book.  Of course it is and then again it is a brazen attempt to cash in off that tragic disaster.  Although the corporate world is, for Chomsky, the second rung of hell, he doesn't mind accepting a few coins along the way.   Amerika is the new imperialist power in case you have forgotten. We practice evil capitalism, plundered markets, poverty and the sheer dumbness of the American people. One could ask, \\"Why do plain folk risk their lives to come to this country and not try for, say, North Korea or Cuba or one of the many Arab dictatorships?\\"<br />His \\"historical\\" arguments remind me of those creationists who start with a premise then change the facts to match the desired outcome.  Chomsky has gotten into a habit of incorporating disparate events and people, then showing a \\"connection\\" where none exists.  I gave it two stars because of the sheer gall someone had to have to have penned such nonsense. Let's get back to the anti-war rally with our \\"Keep Iraq Free\\" sign.	2003-03-06

It was necessary for him to invent a new vocabulary in order to accomplish this.  The trouble is that this vocabulary is rooted in mysticism and faux scientific terminology.<br />He valiantly tries to show the long march from unicellular creatures to modern human.  This is much more plausible than his introduction of a spiritual &quot;zone&quot; through which this evolution is strained.  In other words, evolutionary change with a hidden guiding hand.  Parts of it were beautiful and I agree with the author that man is a unique phenomenon on this planet.  But how one reconciles a physical mechanism with a spiritual theology is a task too great even for a great man.<br />How is Jesus as God reconciled with ape-man or pre-man? Chardin suggests that religion is a natural outgrowth of being human and he may be right.  But it should be noted that the spiritual side of man has evolved along with the physical changes. All we can do is take a &quot;snapshot&quot; of where we are, discover who we were and prepare for who we will become.	2003-03-06

Maybe it's the idea of visiting the future or (more likely) returning to the past to witness/change the course of history.  <br />Kage Baker, in her &quot;Company&quot; books, solved the problem inherent in all time travel novels - how to handle changes in the past as they affect the future. She posited that one could not change RECORDED history but could affect else (neat trick). Apparently Mr. Steele does not follow that approach and in a way this is the logical path.  There are really two tales here.  The first involves the Hindenberg and how its success (or failure) affected world events.  The second, more realized line, involves the creation of time travel.<br />Parts of the tale were excellent - particularly the parts that occurred in Tennessee, my home state.  I have been to the very lake described in the book and those awkward meetings between future and present folks are the stuff of time travel novels.  What the story lacked was polish.  It dragged at times, read clumsily at others, and character development was stillborn.  All that aside, the author has created a good yarn that was worth the price.	2003-03-02

It has compelled people to travel to distant lands, to help those less needy, to give up fortunes to those in need and to dedicated one's life to service and/or study of a higher power.  Wells does not contest this.  More refreshingly, he does not address the issue with the anger, scorn or vicious  condescension often found in works like this.  (Don't authors who engage in this invective realize how they sabotage whatever hope there was of making a point?)<br />Wells has been \\"preaching\\" the Gospel of a Christianity without a historical Jesus for some time.  His series on this subject contains brilliant insights though the themes are repetitive. To wit, there is no external documented record of the man \\"Jesus\\" (besides an interpolated Josephus), Paul seems never to have heard of a Jesus of history, the Christ story is like others of that time, Paul was either mixed up or refining a philosophy involving the ancient \\"Wisdom\\" doctrines, etc...<br />What bothers me about his conclusions is that for some reason a group of people believed in \\"Someone\\" enough to die for this belief. This in itself is not radical:  There are numerous incidents of apparently rational people defending to the death such ideologies as fascism, communism, racism and tribalism. The actions of the first Christians make sense only if they truly believed that their Savior was a real person at one time. The weakness in Well's thesis is explaining how early believers totally misconstrued Paul's message in an amazingly twisted act of interpretation.  Even more, how did the whole idea of Jesus story get started?<br />Wells is best at using scholarship to highlight obvious changes or additions to the text, to point out contradictions or more revealingly - how the life of Jesus became more detailed as one moved further from the date he lived.  Paul seems to have matched \\"someone\\" with several unrelated prophecies in the OldTestament and arrived at a new theology.   He seems totally unaware of a historical \\"Jesus\\" - only a risen \\"Christ\\".  This is reminiscent of the modern German school of Bibical criticism that accepts a Jesus of faith if not a Jesus of history - a preposterous viewpoint in my opinion. <br />Not only is Wells fair, he is also just, quoting scholars with differing opinions and admitting the possibility of truth to their ideas.  The book contains numerous footnotes, references to hosts of scholarly works and an excellent bibliography. This is an excellent book sure to provoke discussion.	2003-02-27

But don't read science fiction for detailed proofs of invisibility, ESP,  teleportation or time travel.<br />I judge a science fiction book not only the originality of the ideas, but also on their plausibility within the context of the story.  In this case, Kage Baker succeeds admirably not only in presenting a well-crafted tale but also by making the \\"science\\" of time travel interesting and familiar.  She has taken a worn-out idea and transformed it into something new and wonderful with its own set of rules - a veritable world within the world.  The idea of a conglomerate gaining a monopoly on time travel and using it just for these means is not only plausible but probable. The use of special children who trade death for servitude is very probable.  <br />Mendoza, the heroine, is realistic - more than those superwomen of the future with their powers and weapons.  Despite her near immortality - and despite warnings and quiet suggestions from Joseph, her rescuer/father confessor - she forms an emotional bond with a mere \\"mortal\\".  The hide and seek game of possessing great powers and using them when no one is looking is always amusing. In this case, the greatest power of all is love, one that captured the heart of the botanist.  Joseph anchors this story through memories, tales and dry wit.  The writing is subtle, spare and beautiful and in the end one feels a great sympathy for Mendoza and unrequieted love.<br />The ideas in this novel are so original and so well presented that I will most assuredly purchase the next book in the series. <BR>Is this a Romance novel crudely disguised as science fiction. If so, it was extremely enjoyable and I am looking forward to the next entry in the series.	2003-02-26

The only problem with the novel is the plot - admittedly a big portion of any book, but in this case occupying a secondary position of importance.  We meet the cyborgs of the future, each with a a monomania for whatever scientific subject the Company decides.  The fact that they are helplessly addicted to studying every aspect of this subject is something they recognize but are helpless to prevent.  <br />It is the Civil War and as Ms. Baker has explained - adding an original twist to the age old time-travel paradox problem - it is impossible to change any RECORDED historical event.  But think of all those that are not recorded!  Anyway, we are in early Hollywood and Mendoza meets her former lover from the first book in another man's body.  The face is the same and he seems to be unaware of anything amiss.  She is overwhelmingly captivated yet once more tragedy intervenes and this time she commits a cardinal sin - murder.<br />Mendoza has somehow attained the ability to travel FORWARD in time. (Baker explains that according to time-travel rules, one can only go backward, not forward.)  Her breaking of this rule and killing those who murdered her lover earn a prison sentence of ungodly cruelty - exile to a time before humans. <br />Several questions arise:  How does Mendoza travel forward in time?  What is the meaning of the reappearance of her former lover?  And what will Joseph do about the approaching convergence between the end of history and the workings of the Company. <br />The	2003-02-26

Discovering a new author is always exciting, particularly one who writes lucidly and beautifully. Kage Baker fits this test perfectly.  But here's the rub:  The first novel introduced us to the Company, its workings and some of its main players. It was an orginal, rollicking adventure that set the stage for the next sequeals.  <br />Unfortunately this one fails in two categories:  (1) The quest (capturing the ancient peoples) is puzzling and boring at best. (2) What about Mendoza, the Spanish beauty we met in the first book?  It was disturbing to have Joseph dress like a wolf and tingle the dumb natives and that's about it!  This may have been an interest to anthropologists but for the average reader it was a long tale of little action and less meaning.<br />We learn a little more about the mysterious Company of the future and hints are suggested about a possible outcome to the whole enterprise.  The wandering tribal preacher at the last seemed forced and out of character.  Let's hope for a return of both Mendoza and a plot with some interest.	2003-02-26

That world, filled with excitement, war, discovery and adventure has vanished.  The spirit of the Messiah permeates the Universe but something has happened.  With the utmost predictability, Mau'dib's words have become codified into holy script and his personhood elevated to divine status.  Despite the thinly-veiled \\"Preacher's\\" crying in the wilderness, the organized clergy tighten their grip on a theocratic society.<br />Of course, this is not the vision of Paul. In perhaps the most philosophical novel of the series, the Preacher asks questions and reflects on the times and circumstances. We are introduced to the twins, endowed with Paul's powers.  One of my gripes is that the kids spoke and acted like miniature adults. They seemed mature beyond their years in more way than one.<br />The palace intrigues were captivating as is the suggestion of what was to come from Leto.

GED brings to fruition some answers to all the philosophical and cultural issues raised in the first three books.  <br />This is a story of the inner self, not a tale of wild action or shattering events.  But this inner self is that of a near God and his musings are nothing short of amazing.  It is without a doubt the most introspective of the series, the language rich and redolent with just the right degree of authenticity. One feels a close comradeship with not only Leto but the band of folks attempting to end his rule.  Especially noticable is Duncan (Paul's friend from the original Dune) who the Emperor has brought back repeatedly- if only to kill and resurrect yet again.  <br />The writing is top-notch in almost every way - plot, character, words, the seamless dialogue from the \\"archives\\"...a splendid achievement!	2003-02-25

Whereas \\"Dune\\" reeked of war and heroism and epic events on a grand scale, this one is more intimate, almost inwardly perspective.  It is not in any way a clone of the first novel but a continuation of the story.<br />The operative word is in the title, \\"Messiah\\".  Both the first and the second novels are presentations of the hope of almost every ancient civilization: A mighty man of goodness will appear and smite the sinners while elevating the downtrodden. The way this prophecy coincides with the ancient breeding program of the Bene Geseret witches is the heart of the first novel.  Although the author obviously favors Arabic/Islamic motifs, the personal story of Paul is more that of Jesus than Mohammed...the curious birth, the one who does not understand his own mission, the teacher and alas, the one who dies for the sins of the world.<br />Like all Messiahs, the teachings are sublimated as the focus of the cult becomes the person. Despite protests, the object of worship becomes the man himself. Casual sayings are codified into a creed that followers misinterpret or translate to support an existing structure. This path may be inevitable since it is far easier to worship someone that follow their advice. Paul, like Mohammed, excels in bloodshed and his adopted Fremen have conquered the Universe in a Holy War to end all wars. The old adage, \\"An evil act is justified by its ultimate goal, \\" plays out repeatedly in this novel.  The Fremen have their Messiah yet nothing really changes, people are still the same inside - only the externals have varied.<br />The palace intrigues are more subtle, the dialogue elevated to a new plane, the philosophical arena larger.  Like Islam, the cult becomes a hereditary institution whose power remains in the family.  Once again, the story of the witches captivates and enthralls and ones attitude toward Paul's siter becomes one of pity at herhelplessness.<br />This is not an easy book to start out with but a necessary one for the series itself.	2003-02-24

The book (without cover) needs LOTS of editing. Continual font shifts (bold, big, small) and the amateurish footnotes and chapter notes gave the book a disjointed air. Indeed, the entire tenor of the tone was that of a final draft of an English major's term paper. The language was stilted, difficult to follow and very repetitive. This chap uses big words because they are big.<br />Vardis Fisher was the quintessential American man of the West, ruggedly individualist, a deep thinker and an excellent story teller.  He was a rabid feminist and a patriotic atheist who undertook an exhaustive search for the truth.  The result was the towering \\"Testament of Man\\", the series documenting the evolution of not only our person but our soul.  Fisher focuses on sex and religion and takes a controversial Judeo-Christian pathway.  <br />The first novel, Darkness and the Deep, has no dialogue, just the actions of the primitive proto-humans.  Already present are the themes that recur in succeeding novels: the strong female, the frustrated male genius, the \\"Alpha\\" male leader, the temptress.  In this review, Fisher is criticized not for his main thesis - that religion and sex and all the conflicts contained in both are the driving force of mankind - but for his inability to prove it.  Anyone who gets through this \\"review\\" will be less - not more - inclined to go searching for this masterpiece. Ignore the commentary and get the series.	2003-02-20

It shows the world under the heel of a victorious Nazi Germany. More depressing,the other half of the Eastern Hemisphere is ruled by a Russian tyranny. Perhaps the worst thought is that one realizes that all the hate and bullying and utter disregard for humanity presented here is replicated in scores of countries today - constant fear, secret police, informers, torture chambers, relentless efforts by the State to force agreement even when all know it's a lie....<br />What was most convincing was not the cruelty or slavery or even the total thought control but the utter greyness, drabness and shabbiness.  That kind of rundown degredation seemed so awful yet so real.  I would've liked a 4 1/2 star rating. The missing half point was for two reasons: (1) The geopolitical aspects were scant.  What about Japan, the USSR, India, etc? (2)The idea that despite their victory, every German would behave like a guard at a concentration camp is unrealistic - especially in light of widespread disattisfaction with living conditions.  Few parents would let their children witness them degrading, beating and torturing someone, even in Naziland.  Germany, like all such regimes, knew that kind of behaviour was uncivilized and sought desperately to hide it from the world.  <br />The best part was the tale of the underground, a daring and very realistic group of (mainly) Polish restistance fighters.  How the two separate plots - the British slave and the underground - merge is a wonderful piece of plotting.  The good guys are not squeaky clean; they are determined and realistic.  The sci-fi aspect introduced at the end seemed almost perfect.<br />This is a great read for a cold winter night	2003-01-30

Different circumstances demand different leadership in all worlds except Harry's.<br />The writing is just...awful.  What can one say?

For example, Harry Turtledove's novels leave me cold since they have such enormous world-shattering events yet the same leaders seem to emerge despite radically different circumstances.<br />The essays here vary in quality and seem to pretty much split along funny / serious lines. The best two for laughs were the ones on President Franklin and the final one on Dukakis.  On a serious note, the Presidency of Dewey and the decision he was forced to make and the one on President &quot;Burr&quot; are affecting. From a sheer political perspective, &quot;Kingfish&quot; is hard to beat. <br />Most disappointing - and most improbable from a historical viewpoint - were the ones where the winning candidate had no chance in reality - women presidents, Goldwater, McGovern, Mondale, FDR's opponents, Stevenson,third parties, etc...

This book has a Western bias!!! I have wondered why it is considered immoral or abnormal for an author who lives in the West, was educated in the West and posseses a Western philosophical, religious and scientific background to have a Western bias.  If  all cultures were morally equivalent they would have similar outcomes and that is certainly not the case. <br />That aside, this is a wonderful primer on both the theory and history of knowledge.  The sheer scope of the work is what makes it enticing.  And the range of what he covers is astounding. It may not be as deep as one likes, nor as far-ranging, but it does accomplish its stated goal - to inform us of the long, sometimes difficult search for knowledge.  I do not agree with all the author's conclusions but he backs them up; nothing is  spoken or claimed in a vaccuum.  Some will most assuredly  disagree with the importance he places on Christianity in the scheme of things but as Daniel Boorstien has pointed out over and over, the Judeo-Christian environment encouraged thinkers and generally maintained a receptivity for original thinking not found in other cultures that remained wedded to the past.  And it is undeniable that Christian Europe created a revolution of ideas that revolutionized and conquered the world in a short span.<br />As many have stated, the last third of the book suffers from an unavoidable problem - the passage of time.  It reminds one of the oxymoron \\"instant analysis\\" which usually fulfills the former and rarely the latter.  Still, despite the myopia, some of the ideas he suggests are provocative and even witty.  Get a copy and enjoy.	2003-01-06

I must part company with this one, though.  It commits the unpardonable sin for literature: It bores.  Despite several provocative sub-plots and themes (racial prejudice, child-bearing questions,  gender equality, religion) not one is developed fully. The book seems written in starts and fits; a promising idea is introduced and expounded, when suddenly we leave the narrative for yet another walk through the countryside with animals or observers as Ayla imparts her womanly wisdom of the ages.<br />The meandering New Age chanting is repetitive at best and infuriating at worst.  Considering what we now know about the development of religious ceremony (including chorus)in ancient Greece, it is highly improbable that this level of thought (which sounds suspiciously modern) was reached.  For one thing, abstraction in language is a rather recent development. Although primitive man invoked ceremony when burying the dead, it is doubtful that a deep level of theological sophistication was reached.<br />The relationship between the two main characters does not grow nor really change.  He is still in awe of Ayla and her powers  and she is still panting for his manly, uh, accessories.  Mom, dad and all the relatives added little to the story.  In fact, the half-breeds, which held the most promise, simply faded away. I suppose the chief complaint is that I was expecting something bold or new or different on the order of Clan of the Cave Bears. Despite intense research and quirky, original ideas on how primitive folks lived, the story reminds me of that saying:  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.	2002-12-30

Of course, it soon becomes apparent that this tale follows the Christ story (in explicit detail) - from the ragtag group of followers, to the shunning masses (who STILL don't get the real message), to those who only care about the miracles to the raising of the dead and, at last, sacrifice and resurrection and a new life in his teachings.<br />On one level, there is the story of the mystery man - the one everyone knows - who becomes the great Teacher with the all of the attending attention.  He is the moral teacher, the one who breaks the rules and must decide how far to go.  Like Christ, he is aware of his own impending doom and sees that his message will only be greater after his death.  This is the book that most authors wish they could write but never do.	2002-12-20

True, it is sci-fi and it has a tremendous plot that winds back on itself, the characters are some of the quirkiest and most interesting in literature...maybe it is a combination of all these elements.<br />One pet peeve I have with futurists is their depiction of the Earth as an environmental disaster as hordes of free-roaming sub-humans terrify the countryside.  YET, scientific progress seems to continue unabated.  That aside, this tale is a gem!! From the genius teenager to the searching mom to the innocent gal - from locale to locale - Theroux has assembled a cast and story that resonates long after one finished the last words.  <br />Innocence in all its many forms is an underlying theme with almost every major character - from the mom to the son to the roamers to the gal and even to the long lost (?) male donor - involved in some type of sudden awarenenss that the world is not as benign as they once thought.  The coming of age of the young teenager is perfect in its perplexity and complexity.<br />Get this book and lock the door!!	2002-12-20

Her novels and novellas are not of the type &quot;This is Cronon from the planet Abuzz, stop your atomic testing of be destroyed&quot;  They are instead, intelligen far-reaching reveries on the future.  In several of her stories she has extrapolated a Mulism planet but this book goes beyond that to a time we can barely fathom.<br />What happens when a woman in a strictly segregated society commits the ultimate sin - falling in love with a man?  The descriptions of the two varying societies and their need for each other is told with a sense of disquiet. And when the lovers finally &quot;find each other&quot; the language approaches a confession. This is a book that can be read again and again on several levels.	2002-12-16

However, the attempt to make him a \\"great\\" man (word or deed) was not worthy of the book.  What I wanted to discover was WHY such a non-entity, one who rarely was in his own country, would be remembered as a savior despite having imposed the most tyrannical regime that ever existed on hundreds of millions people. <br />Lenin possessed (like Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Saddamn) the same ruthless, myopic, self-centered outlook as a child as he did as an adult.  In other words, he never matured.  Only the violence increased as he grew older. Indeed, one is still stunned that millions can be casually ordered to die due to economic status or political views. The author follows Lenin's activities both chronologically and philosophically as he meets, adopts then implements (through force, of course) his version of \\"Heaven on Earth\\" (what the Socialists used to call Socialism).<br />Lenin's brand of class hatred, his campaign against whole groups of people is not surprising in a country where individual rights had never found root.  What was expected was the annihilation of whole groups due to their status as \\"enemy of the state\\".  The first modern totalitarian state was the result and the human costs have been mind-boggling.  Vladimir Bukovsky estimates that 50 million have been murdered (starved, tortured, sent to Siberia, shot outright etc) since 1917.  Stalin simply raised Lenin's policies to a new level.  <br />Despite its attempts to paint Lenin in a somewhat rosy light (a difficult task), this is still an informative book.	2002-12-16

The idea of an interview in a dark room with a real vampire is enough to get most people's attention.  But the way the plot melts into the story of the vampire is a work of art.<br />The screen version emphasized the spectacular, the gory and the sensational. Missing were the sensualness, the mystery and the darkness that permeated the saga.  The author's powers of invention (her latter works tend toward repetition - a common problem) were never greater than what follows.  The life and times of the vampires themselves capture the imagination and she manages to instill a sense of sorrow and empathy for these soulless creatures - even as they do their mayhem.<br />For a flight of adventure and fantasy, put on some Bach (or better, Vierne or Widor), pour a glass of red wine, grab some blue cheese and an apple and prepare to enter the mists.	2002-12-12

For years, the The Left has held an almost universal hold in public intellectual discourse. The result is a monochrome landscape in which only &quot;correct&quot; attitudes are permitted.  Those thinking otherwise are dismissed out of hand.  The current totalitarian nature of academic intellectual life  - &quot;non-progressive&quot; ideas are not tolerated  -is a fitting conclusion.  Perhaps the rampant rise of anti-Semitism among the Left is yet another sad ending.<br />That said, this is not an intellectual study per se.  It IS a very entertaining series of intellectual biographies of many of the major icons from the past 300 years. The question of whether one's personal foibles affect the veracity of their political ideology is an old debate.  What one can say with assuredness is that intellectuals have given rise to some of the most heinous movements in the history of mankind:  communism, socialism, fascism, tribalism and religious bigotry. The result of all these various experiments in tyranny were as grim as they were predictable.<br />Concerning the role of intellectuals, a casual study of Africa reveals that the overwhelming majority of future dictators were from academia, and their heroes were Western intellectuals.  Like many featured in the book, few had any practical experience outside the world of ideas.  Yet - and this is the point of the whole exercise - they and their Western counterparts were more than willing to tell the rest of us how to live.  Worse, the solutions almost inevitably involved violence (Marx's secret obsession).  Elaborate abstract schemes for implementing these plans percolate to the top every few years and when they prove uttery unworkable they are quietly discarded.  <br />The essays vary in quality and detail but all are easy to digest.  For a counterpoint to the prevailing winds, read this book.	2002-12-11

The saga expands in an almost poetical vein with pointed characterization and succinct plots within plots. The ideas discussed in this book - origins, family, meaning of  life, aliens, religion, discovery - require a sequeal and perhaps a prequel.  <br />High praise for the sparse, direct, superb writing and crafting.<BR>Kudos for interesting characters and for a new presentation of several well-used themes.  Man's first encounter with ETs has been told again and again, yet this indirect approach is one of the best. The horrific race remains thoroughly &quot;alien&quot; to the end - their thoughts, morals, purposes and society a mystery, undecipherable.  More positives:  The elusive, alluring female priest, the shadowy bishop, the manner in which the dark, cloistered mood is created.<br />Points needing expanding or revising: The origin of the &quot;Ship&quot;,<BR>The prominence of the Church - for logical not philosophical reasons.  If anything, the role of the Church in the far future will be less that it is not now. The inscrutability of the aliens - why did they commit these horrific acts, to what purpose?  Why did they remain hidden?  Finally, what happens to the group on Antioch.<br />Still, if you are not looking for &quot;this is Agon from the planet Zedur; stop your atomic testing or face destruction&quot; fiction but instead want a heady, taut experience, this is the one for you.	2002-12-09

Johnson goes after modern cultural icons with vigor, examining and reassessing all the way. He has perfected a writing style that is highly readable and entertaining with common components:  Broad assumptions,  intricate details supporting his idea and unique, incredibly interesting biographies of those that made a difference - known or unknown.   <br />The 20th century IS the collectivist century. Every variant of collectivism from communism, fascism, tribalism, socialism and religious classism has been tried with catastrophic results. The eagerness with which \\"leaders\\" (most from academia) experimented on whole populations is truly horrific.  Glowing theories always gave way to human suffering.  Millions have been sacrificed in the name of collectivism just this century - USSR, China, Germany, Cambodia, Turkey, Africa...<br />Oddly, speaking ill of this most anti-democratic \\"theory\\" is seen as somehow impolite. Johnson records the fight and the fighters (on both sides) of this battle. Naturally the US and Britain emerge with glowing marks - and why not? Those two have  saved the world many times. Germany would have won WWI and WWII without US intervention. Europe would be one vast socialist graveyard without the opposition of Truman. Korea, Japan and parts of South America would be \\"Peoples States\\" without our  help. Relativism has spread to almost all facets of human existence with perhaps the most dangerous one being that all cultures are morally equivalent.  This book aptly demonstrates that this has not - and is not - true.	2002-11-10

I see some have complaints:  he is biased (who isn't?), Palestinians are short changed, only Western Jews were present, the book is too entertaining, too dense, etc.  Hopefully, the rest of us will concentrate on the theme - that Judaism is unique and its  influence on the modern world is staggering. <br />Johnson has given excellent treatment to both the secular and religious aspects of the history. While his Bibical renditions may strike some as simplistic, they are integrated with the story.  We are told about the \\"hidden years\\" - the time before 1100 AD.  The author introduces us to a variety of Jewish thinkers in the political, artisitic, scientific and above all, social realm. Judaism has always been a religion of works and deeds instead of abstract theology.<br />This is a story of perseverance, tragedy and hope.  The horrors committed on this people are unbelievable yet they persevered.  Their story is particularly apt for our time with the sharp rise of anti-semitism among leftists in both Europe and on American college campuses. Jews are being savaged because for their pro-Western orientation thus proving their incalcuble contribution to modern society.	2002-11-10

It does not have the broad sweep of Modern Times or the monumentalism of History of the American People or the meditative quality of History of the Jews but it does have a thoroughly detailed examination of a relatively unknown era.   <br />He asserts that this era is of immense importance to the modern world in that the rhythm of our life - politics, music, science, religion - was established during this time. In his usual quirky and entertaining way, his presentations of the personalities of the time provide a startling behind-the-scenes look at those we thought we knew.  He also includes those we do not know or those on the fringes and insists their contributions are many times more than those we celebrate.  The movement of the story is a work of art in itself as it switches from subject to subject without ever losing either interest or direction.  If you are interested in the Romantic Movement and the establishiment of modern social strucures, read this book.	2002-11-10

Boorstin, the former Librarian of Congress, seems to have distilled that entire collection into one book.  This is the story of man's inquisitive mind, why some cultures are curious and why others are not.  The variety of subjects covered are astonishing - exploration, science, art, politics.  Boorstin reminds me of the historian Paul Johnson in that he combines a moving plot line of events with quirky, interesting biographies of the famous and not so famous.  <br />This is an epic story stretching from pre-history to the present.  One is continually amazed and thrilled at what human beings have thought and accomplished.  The author has been quoted as saying that his book was only a prelude to his next work, the Creators.  I can hardly wait.	2002-11-09

The life of this &quot;First American&quot; progresses at a leisurely, entertaining pace.  Yet the occasional light-hearted treatment never gets in the way of the authors thesis - that Franklin was the quintessentail American with all the qualities we associate with being American - can-do attitude, inquisitive, lover of freedom, capitalist and achiever...as well as filled with an uncommon common sense.<br />BF is one of the few Founding Fathers that come across with a sense of humor - from practical jokes to the assumption of imaginary letter written to newspapers intending to invoke controversy.  He was the only American to sign all four Revolutionary documents and without his tireless efforts both in the states and in Europe the struggle would have been harder.  He was, despite all his genius and airs, a tradionalist while being a humanist, free-thinker, republican and a great believer in the notion of individual effort and personal responsibility. <br />His life - all 82 years - was extraordinarily rich, surpased only by his compatriot and sometimes rival, John Adams.  Both men viewed the Revolution as a universal - not American - event that had great portents for the future.  In this they have been cannily prescient.	2002-11-09

Their main goal (apart from the ubiquitous violence) is an end to free trade and capitalism. (No word on what will replace a market system.)  At the just completed conference on development, environmental groups protested such things as outdoor plumbing, electricity to villages in Africa and the idea of using credit instead of traditional ways (bartering goods). This in spite of all evidence that these things have made life easier and longer for 3rd world folks.<br />On another level, the Left is mounting a relentless, ideological assault at universities against any discussion of ideas it does not approve of and on those same campuse and in Europe, one witnesses a rising tide of virulent anti-semitism. Jews have always been connected with the financial side of capitalism which may explain some of the hatred. The problem with the &quot;New Left&quot; is that they view industrialism as predominantly a matter of workers engaging in manual tasks.  The idea that physical abd not intellectual labor drives economies would be applicable in a pre-industrial society.  And that, I guess, was the point of these essays - that what the New Left is asking for is anti-industrial in nature.<br />Yes, some of these essays stretch the point - but the idea of comparing unlike events to arrive at a stated conclusion is quite common.  What this book does do is remind us that ideas have consequences in the real world. Prophetically, the article on public schools sounds as if it could have been written yesterday.	2002-11-09

One of the reasons this story is so tantalizing is that there exists rumors and semi-evidence of several \\"fifth\\" Gospels. The story had several unique features - from the reprinted \\"Gospel\\" to the political aspects (far-fetched) to the addresses by God (\\"We think...\\").  <br />I have often thought this would make an excellent movie on the order of Sagan's \\"Contact\\" but in retrospect I can see Hollywood introducing sex, emphasize the change of locales and the chase and downplay the intellectual/religious aspects of the story.  If a theater cannot show Kazanzaki's \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" (a soaring, beautiful work) then how could they show  a tale that purports that Jesus never rose from the dead?<br />The writing is just superb, the research impressive, and even the footnotes within the Gospel seemed to enhance instead of detract from the saga.

I like his  manner of writing, deprecating humor and incredible facility for research.  This book is simply a tour de force - no other words to describe it.<br />While not religious, Fox is just, even fair, in his treatment of a book many consider the Word of God. First and foremost he is a historian of the first degree, conversant with both the religious views of the past and the social setting in which they arose and thrived.  The book travels along a fairly straight line but by subject - not chronologically.    <br />For all the rants against the author he more or less accepts the Bibical accounts as being genuine which is not to say they are valid or even true.  He does not ask obvious questions - how could a people without an alphabet or writing materials preserve a history of themselves or their god?  Instead he compares stories, searches for meaning, finds numerous flaws in both prophecy and inner logic and lets the reader decide.<br />In his dating of the New Testament he is quite conservative. His text comparisons are interesting as are his descriptions of local customs of the time.  The manner in which this disparate groups of stories became our Bible is a mystery story in itself but the author sticks with the words and their context.  This work is very readable and written for the educated layman.	2002-11-09

One reads of BIble stories and martyrs and popes but nothing on the events that led to the overthrow of the gods of a religious people.  In this book, one discovers that early Christians were the &quot;Atheists&quot; since they did not worship a pagan god.  <br />Pagan gods were wondrously easygoing.  Each town or family had their own god.  Acceptance or rejection was entirely personal.  Gods could be adopted, created, borrowed or discarded depending on the social circumstance. Christianity demands that only &quot;God&quot; (Jesus) receive adoration, thus setting up a conflict that resulted in one side winning and outlawing the former gods. <br />What is particularly interesting is the daily life of the people and how their religion affected them.  Pagans were generous with their money, held services, performed rituals and prayed for success or money.  Even more interesting is the manner in which Christianity adapted and adopted from pagans - both in theology and ritual.  The mystical union of god and man was a uniquely pagan thought as was the &quot;Mind of God&quot;.  We read about the ferocious fights concerning divinity (&quot;Was Jesus one or separate with God?&quot;), scripture (books were &quot;voted&quot; holy at synods) and ceremony.  Christianity owes at least as much to paganism as it does Judaism. Get this book and The Unauthorized Version, Fox's other masterpiece.	2002-11-09

The complexity is still present but there is a bitterness here not found in her prior works.  She never employs random killings, senseless crimes, or madmen.  What she does do is paint a heart-rending portrait of the human condition better than anyone I know. Character and plot develop together - a difficult task that seems to be her forte.  I wondered how the seemingly disparate parts related but never fear, they are joined in an incredible ending.<br />The characters in this book continue to haunt me.  Ones feelings toward the \\"heroine\\" slowly evolve from revulsion to anger to pity to awe as the story proceeds. The way she connects animal rights, disease, sports and above all, human relations, is superb.  This is without a doubt one of the finest mysteries ever penned.	2002-11-09

I liked architecture and picked it up.  WOW!  The strangest thing I've read in the reviews is the criticism of the writing which I think is both bitter and brilliant.  <br />Just as Atlas Shrugged was about Dagny and Hank, this story is about Dominique and Wynand.  Wynand's depiction is surely one of the greatest of all time...just the right touch.  In the end, Roark is still distant, unknown, more an idea than a flesh and blood person.  But the way the plot weaves and intertwines and finally joins is just incredible!  Especially moving are the scenes between Roark and Wynand, particularly their parting.<BR> <BR>This is a startling book because it is so different from the vast majority of what is now published - shoddy stories filled with cardboard characters, needless gore, obscenity, non-stop action and a complete lack of intellectual focus. It seems quite timeless (I first read it in 1969) even today because its focus is not trendy events or fads but the timeless interplay of people.  Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy.	2002-11-05

In fact he states that he sees history from a \\"Euro-centric\\" perspective, which, after all only makes sense since that is his and our heritage.  He is writing a book for mainly Americans about the history of creation.  It is the 2nd of the \\"Knowledge Trilogy\\":  The Discoverers, this book and \\"The Seekers\\".  <br />If the Discoverers covered the searching mind then the Creators is a study of the searching soul.  Covering topics as far apart as music, art, poetry, religion, architecture, literature, psychology and science, he skillfully reviews the history of man's search for himself.  His quirky yet factual tidbits of history enlighten the story of (mainly) Western culture although he does examine aspects of other cultures.  If you are a person  interested in all things human then this is the book for you. <br />The Creators has been criticized for its so-called \\"Western\\" outlook as if that automatically made the work suspect.  Why is the European viewpoint less worthy than say, an Arab viewpoint?  The West has profoundly affected the  world - and continues to do so today - unlike any other culture with such ideas as liberty, democracy, pluralism and individualism.  And what kind of person denigrates their own culture for no other reason than its trendy to do so?   This is a magnificent work that will keep you enthralled for days.  Get it now	2002-11-05

Everyone knows the physical catastrophe of Socialism but Murachik demonstrates that its ideas are the reasons for its abysmal performance.  It is a movement directly in conflict with our evolutionary psychology. What has always puzzled me is the favorable attitude toward Socialism found among intellectuals  when the results have consistently been poverty, tyranny, and loss of freedom. <br />The story is not pretty but it is interesting.  The movement began in the French Revolution and immediately decreed that  opposition would not be tolerated.  One can see the seed of censorship, the secret police and coercion from the start. We meet Marx, a thoroughly detestable man who never entered a factory or mine, yet spun absurd theories of production that have been distinctly unsuccessful.  He craved a Utopia - a changeless society in which everything is first destroyed then reinvented,  regimented, enforced and where compliance is mandatory.<br />Needless to say, such schemes emerged through violence and remained in power only through force. Socialism &amp; its variants - communisms, fascism, tribalism - have killed more people than any movement in history.  Yet they still have their defenders in Europe and on college campuses.

A white takeover in S Africa is about as likely as an Indian takeover in the US. And does anyone really think the small S AFrican military can challenge the world? Then there is the matter of the most pacifist state in Europe returning to fascism and attacking their neighbor with nukes (right).  No reason is ever given for these irrational turn of events.  In true story fashion, they &quot;just happened.&quot;<br />The story's characters are mere caricatures - the brave American sailor, the winsome gal, the enemy commander (&quot;Americans have grown soft&quot;).  No character development, just undersea action.  But then most folks who like this sort of thing enjoyed the technical jargon that fills this novel. I can put up Tom Clancy rhapsodizing on calibers, M23X and JayVee 7As because of the good writing, plot and characters.  But here one faces random, improbable events, cardboard characters with unimaginative dialogue and boring writing. Take a pass.	2002-10-27

The story could be compelling (alien invasion, resistance) but it devolves into a clumsy pleading on race, multiculturalism and the evil West. The aliens are so humanlike as to be non-alien and virtually the entire story takes place on the West coast; it's as if the rest of the world vanishes.<br />The plot is almost as bad as the characters. Aliens and humans fight each other and themselves.  The location switches could make one dizzy as they move with the logic of drunk:  We meet conspirators on various parts of the West coast, fly into space, go on a military mission in Central America, sink in a slave mine all in rapid succession.  Despite mankind's near extinction the characters have time to reflect on (America's) racial injustices and note that hey, the aliens are racists too!<br />The ending is one of those things penned on the way to the editor.  Dietz tries to be philosophical, dramatic, sensitive and exciting and fails miserably on all counts. Yes, humans finally win (you knew they would) but by this time everything has gotten so confused you don't even care.	2002-10-26

The entire attack took a few pages (and even this is boring) and we learn that the REAL problem for the few humans left is NOT space invaders but racists whites in America.<br />The three types of aliens - confusing in the extreme - are so utterly unalien as to be laughable.  They think and reason the same as humans.  The humans were pure cardboard - white racists worshiping Hitler (in 2020!), the unwilling hero, brave women, bad politicians.  The repeated references to S Africa, Native Americans, American slavery, Palestinians, MLK were a simplistic recourse to push-button topics and were more clumsily written that my 8th grader could do.  Geopolitical aspects are absent.   It appears the entire experience occurs on the US West Coast.<br />The action is rushed, plotlines unresolved, internal logic lacking...it is hard to describe how really bad this tale is.  The absolute worst part is the sheer ludicrousness of the story -that the remaining humans are worried about skin shade when billions have perished and the rest are enslaved.  As I said, just ludicrous. And when you get to the end it is not the end- you have to buy another book to find out how it all ends.<BR>Thanks but no thanks.	2002-10-22

The reader is an actor who successfully portrays women, men, foreigners, Southerners, New Englanders with equal virtuosity.  This format made the already good historical novel a great one.  <br />The philosophical infighting and political cat-fighting of the period are not hard to find if one scratches the surface. This book traces the origins of the two party system through the lives of those who stood out in this era - Washington, Adams, Madison, Monroe but particularly Jefferson, Hamilton and the hilariously outrageous newspapermen of the day. <br />Some are shocked to hear these icons so bitterly detested one another and in particular the many shenanigans of Jefferson who always contradicted his grand ideas with smarmy deeds. But the novel sets off in a new direction and the muckrakers become the heart and soul of the story.  The language is incredible for its fidelity to the style of the time - though some are actual quotes from letters and papers -  and indeed it reads like a historical diary.  <br />The story is also told from several points of view - Hamilton, Jefferson, Adams and best of all, the glorious muckrakers. It sounds odd, but the story had pathos, excitement and incredible amounts of humor.  Especially considerate was the appendix at the end that traced the lives of the main characters in the novel.	2002-09-09

Especially telling are the stories on the unlikely - how a small backward nation like England came to control 1/4 of the world (trade not despotic imperialism) and why area with seemingly insurmountable leads - Arabs, China, Spain/Portugal lost influence, power and wealth.<br />He emphasizes not only the geographic and periodic reasons but the technological and particularly the intellectual reasons. He shows that ideas can and do affect the way history turns out.<br />Too many times our history in schools is taught from a distance. In an effort to convince ourselves that all cultures are morally equivalent, all comparisons between cultures are avoided.  Yet it is the intellectual stimulation, the ideas generated by great men and women that drive nations onward. The author demonstrates that a nation can take nothing for granted. Inertia never succeeds in the long run.	2002-09-09

As someone who has visited Africa and talked frequently with those who have I can only say &quot;Amen&quot; to the abominable conditions he describes.<br />Yet, even as he describes the tribal slaughters, the tortures, the theft of entire nations, insane human engineering schemes that moved millions around like chess pieces - he remains not only concerned but profoundly sympathetic.  He tries to make us understand how leader after leader chose the pathway of dictatorship and bankrupt economies while preaching freedom and self-determination.  The chapter on the OAS is a much-needed humorous interlude.  He keeps reminding us that the story of post-colonial Africa is NOT just politicis and raving madmen in control of millions of people.  He keeps the story on the people of the continent.<br />The book is dated but the observations are truer now than then. Since then apartheid was abolished but a million people have been slaughtered in Rwanda, 2 million have died in the interminable &quot;Congo&quot; war, hundreds of thousands have been killed in Sudan, Angola and Liberia and whole nations exists in name only.  What the author stresses over and over is the potential for greatness on the continent, the mineral wealth, the food potential, the resourcefulness of the people, the determination of ordinary people to thrive in such conditions.<br />Today this is a politically incorrect book in that he casts a wide net of blame - colonial powers, Americans, Soviets, Chinese and, in the end, Africans themselves.	2002-09-09

They have developed a creed and a theology baed on opinions set in stone. &quot;Leaders&quot; make dire prophecies and refuse to look at opposing facts.  Despite the numerous  predictions - famine by 21st century, 50% of all species extinct, cancer rates skyrocketing, mass starvation in most of the word, deformities will mushroom due to chemicals, etc. - not a one has even came close to occurring, they continue undisturbed in their faith.<br />The author's biggest problem is not going to be solved by a book - even one as good as this one. He is attemmpting to fight a battle using scientific data, facts and teaching,  whereas the opponents use emotion, wild claims, false science and ideology. Facts that do not agree with a stated opinion are ignored or ridiculed.<br />This book, appearing at this juncture in the environmental fight, provides an amazing array of charts, facts and sources.  The comparisons with the claims of the zealots are remarkable.  Especially telling were the many measurements of progress in almost every area of human activity - from life expectancy, to food to clean water.  This is in direct conflict with the doom and gloom we hear on a regular basis.  The return to a pastoral setting, which many of the &quot;theologians&quot; evoke displays an incredible lack of knowledge about pre-industrial conditions.  Wisely, the author does not pretend that &quot;all is well&quot; but does try to restore a little balance to the argument over humankind's role on Earth.<br />The power of this book is evident by the over-reaction from the &quot;mainstream&quot; media. I have heard it disparaged on NBC, CBS,  MSNBC, NPR and read &quot;reviews&quot; in many publications (NY TImes, Washington Post, Scientific American)  All these blasts have one thing in common.  Very little attention is paid to the facts and the the main argument seems to be that he had the temerity to challenge the world view promulgated by the preachers. Read this book and enjoy.	2002-06-14

The book is an excellent chronicle of his political life with romantic, swashbuckling, warrior, social aspects thrown in for good measure.  All in all, a brilliant work.  So why not a 5 *?<br />Two reasons:  (1) The reading was difficult at times with an excessive use of convoluted writing - a style that the author has displayed time and again.  (2) Perhaps for a British subject this would have been an easier read, but it had WAY too many references to [for example] &quot;Scott Dover (later Lord Baldeshire of Manchester) married the first time to Lindsey Davenport (nee Ambrose) - of the Welsh side of the Derbyshires - and the second time to Margaret Thorose (Dame Headley, daughter of the infamous Mark Headley  - Lord Ashford)....   I found these repeated phrases simultaneously confusing, silly and superfluous.  <br />Still, the story grows and it is a good read	2002-01-25

He wrote one a few years ago arguing that President Clinton was innocent and his scandals were the fault of the investigators.  It was an attempt to clear - after the fact - his name in the impeachment/trial hearings.  The author was and is a liberal Democrat and this should be kept in mind.  (Nothing wrong with that, by the way. My wife is one.)<br />In this rendition of post-election events, the author is VERY selective in his presentation.  Missing is a detailed analysis of the machinations by Gore that caused the SC to take the case in the first place.  Almost summarily dismissed is the illegal recount demanded by Gore of only Dem counties without a shred of evidence that intentional fraud occurred.  Very little is said about the Fl lower courts - all of whome were Democrat and all of whom agreed with Bush in every single instance.  <br />In discussing the FL SC, he is asking  - either implicitely or complicitely - that illegal ballots be counted.  We know now that of all the legal ballots, no matter what the criteria, Bush won.  If the FL SC had stood (a decision roundly criticized in legal circles) this would have led to an endless round of court proceedings involving Gore's felon votes, the denied votes of servicemen and women, the early call, etc would have occupied us for months.  <br />To those having trouble with the SC decision, the legitimacy of a Gore administration would be in question if he was selected by the FL SC instead of the national one.  A good case can be made that election rules were changed after the fact and that differing standards were in place within a single electoral entity.  Good pleading / bad reading.	2001-08-07

We learn new things about Hamilton, Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, Kennedy, Eisenhower.  Plus we learn about the unknowns - that throng of individuals who made contributions to the society and material prosperity and intellectual freedom we enjoy today.<br />The Story of America is basically an optimistic work as he sees this country as an experiment still percolating new freedoms, material products and leading the world into an American future. He writes that the American people are probably the most pragmatic in the world, relying on experience and tradition rather than some new-fangled theory as Europeans are wont to do. This basic foundation serves as a bedrock for our nation - both culturally and societally.<br />If you want one book about America, this is the one to get!	2001-08-07

I would have liked to have given a negative rating if it had been possible.<br />The story is so disjointed and uneven it truly makes for a difficult read. I detected several novels here - Atlas Shrugged (smart people take down the evil guys), Captain Nemo, The Time Machine, a Ludlum conspiracy.  His &quot;philosphy&quot; is trite and juvenile: the internet causes the end of civilization (plus the wornout &quot;evil rich guys&quot;  thrown in for good measure). He makes no distinction between a corrupt CEO and a dictator who kills millions. And his merry band (surely the most improbable group outside of X-men) try to &quot;correct&quot; this wrong through such means as assassination, forgery, planting evidence, covering up crimes, etc.<br />The science would make a high school sophomore blush and the mad rush to complete the action makes it nearly impossible to get to know - much less empathize - with a single character. This is an unmitigated disaster.	2001-07-06

He continually gave Lutece the highest award year after year for the very reasons found in this book:  No fancy dancy, inside out topsy turvey &quot;presentation&quot;, no exotic mixing of Indian and Southern cooking, no &quot;tricks&quot;.  What he admired was the sheer artistry behind the dish, the always fresh ingredients, the simple yet complete recipes that harken back to the chef's days as a boy in France and in particular, the Alsace region.<br />Many of these offerings are peculiarly French with ingredients that may not be common to average American cooks.  Yet almost all can be prepared at home with a little bit of time and effort. This is NOT food for the diet crowd although Soltner's use of creams and butters and oils is entirely reasonable and serves to accentuate rather than hide flavors.  Particularly appealing are the many stories of his childhood and early cooking days that are shared throughout the book.	2001-03-29

That book was startling in its originality and was bought simply because it was yet another &quot;Dune&quot; book. Saying that, it was very enjoyable.<br />I had feared &quot;House Harkonnen&quot; for the simple reason that I did not see how the Baron could possibly serve in a full-length setting for a story.  I was wrong.  It is just as good and just as original (maybe more) as their previous work.  I have only one complaint - the continual switching from storyline to storyline for each chapter.  It was meant to heighten the tension but only caused agitation.<br />Still, the story of Leto's first child, the relatives of the Baron, the Bene Geserit breeding &quot;error&quot;, the fight on Ix and all the other subplots were stunningly tied together.  One MUST read Dune and the other prequel in order to understand  both the language and the plot.  <br />This book was filled with bitterness - the torture-loving nephew of the Baron, the destruction of the IXians, the loss of Leto's son and first concubine, the loss of the Sisterhood in denying love...all these made it a bitter-sweet read.  It also set the stage for the next book which, to me, will be the greatest challenge and the greatest opportunity since the rulers of the known Universe are the least-detailed in the stories so far.	2000-10-20

I was excited upon  hearing that he had a new book.  I was quite  surprised.   <br />Charlie/McCain/Kerry is about as venal and cynical as the people he  berates.  He was a true military hero, a Democratic Senator, and a 1992  presidential contender against Stanton/Clinton (who is as repulsive and  charming as ever). We are again immersed in the power politics of the  Democratic Party and ethical and personal quandrums along the way.  (Why do  political thrillers always feature Democrats?  This is especially galling  when there are 31 GOP governors and they control Congress.)<br />The story  picks up at Primary Colors (1992) and the choice of  Clinton/Stanton's  running mate.  The description of Al Gore was priceless.  The heavy use of  DC inside talk is soon burdensome to anyone outside the Beltway and while  Capitol Hill and media folks may have chuckled at the &quot;inside&quot;  jokes, it was a swamp to most.  I was left scrambling to match the  fictional and actual personas.   The plot slowed to a snail's pace in the  middle. <br />My problem is this:  He attempted to portray Charlie, the war  hero, as a political hero but he was certainly uninspirational.  He  rationalizes bad votes, criticizes the left while accepting their aid,  pouts, throws tantrums, pontificates, deprecates, whines...to me he was  such a typical politician that I was thinking, &quot;Am I supposed to feel  something for this guy?&quot; He was an anti-hero of sorts.  One pleasing  aspect of Klein's work is the voice he gives to the opposition -  exemplified in a quiet speech by the Muffler Man, Charlie's senatorial  opponent.  It is perhaps the most credible prose in the book.  I hate to do  this, but only read this book if you have something else to do.	2000-09-14

It strays from infantile political ravings (the world turns Islamic  and the deep South becomes an Islamic state), psuedo-futuristic events that  seem totally implausible and absolutely outlandish and unbelievable  characters.  Once again, the authors are at their worst when at their most  intimate.  Characters (who are they?) seem to appear, disappear without any  rhyme or reason and the political events are so unreal as to be laughable.   American keeping all minorities in ghetto by law by 2005?  In 2030, white  American will be 30% of the population?  Chinese will take over and we will  know and accept it calmly voting for &quot;Yo-Yu&quot; (I kid you not) or  Li Chiang corporation/ticket.

It depicts a Clinton-like Georgia politician  (minus the bimbos) who somehow gets in a race for the Presidency  &quot;against all odds&quot;.  Not much thought as to political theory -  sorta liberal, fuzzy, not a lot of time given to issues.  Instead, what  should have been a taut thriller was a yawn.  The treatment was quite  amateurish.<br />The author tried a few tricks.  The use of the &quot;f&quot;  word on the first page from the future first lady was one. The woman (who  was based on Hillary) never uses it again in the book and in fact the word  was used only a couple more times.  Talk about gratuitous language.  My  main complaint is the almost universal shallownes of the characters who  were so one-dimensional.  The politicians were so token (the SC Senator had  a black mistress and had been in the KKK) and it seemed every politician in  DC was either sick or had had an accident.  The wife was simply a presence.   Oddly, the only character developed was the villian, a militia-type guy in  the back woods who seemed strangely poignant and bitter-sweet.  Despite his  backwardness he was somehow capable of outwitting government agents at  every turn.  <br />At the end, I found my mind racing trying to recall the  names of the characters in the books. All in all, skip it and find another  one.	2000-08-17

Wandering around a bookstore I saw Term Limits but a worker said that this one was even better.  I like books that have clearly delineated lines between good and evil.  This one clearly does with the  terrorist as evil incarnate and the All-American hero bursting with pride  and action for his country.  <br />I read the book in one setting with two  bags of  popcorn, a milkshake, pasta and cold pizza.  The White House  intrigues, the whole political scene with the interdepartmental clashes and  wounded egos seemed very realistic.  I am also glad he has set this in a  future administration that seems almost normal.   Although it is more  likely that a biological attack will be the real culprit this read like a  terrorist game plan.<br />The only fault was the lack of a love story.

I doubt that many of us have eaten at many (or any) of these gourmet palaces described in the book, but we can still dream.  I enjoyed the whole setup - the  decision to go, the pair that traveled, the 65 Mustang, the sheer gall of  the adventure...but most of all, the food.<br />The descriptions of both the  land, the people, the buildings and all the internal machinations of  running and thriving in the ruthless business were enlightening and  enjoyable.  Especially good were the many conversations with the various  chef-owners and their differing philosophies.  Some of the places are no  longer in business - so what?  At least they once were and they served food  on the order not found in America.  Did I consider the author opinionated?   Sure, that's why I bought the book.

When I finished I thought the treatment of the premise was better that I'd  ever imagined.  But what  garbage one has to go through to reach the end!<br />I can take books about  bad guys - even those that praise the creeps as somehow worth redemption.   What I cannot take are the amoral &quot;heroes&quot;- those people who do  evil things without considering them evil.  The so-called hero in this book  started out as a young Red in the 80's in America (unlikely), worked for  the KGB and its successor, the Organization.  In the course of his many  manifestations (every ten years he became younger but lost his memories) he  killed innocent people to &quot;make it look good&quot;, shot a housewife  in the mouth, tortured, murdered kids, and engaged in the worst terrorism  possible.  All these cute activies were were presented in a slightly giggly  tone of &quot;well, so what?&quot; <br />Most evil people acknowledge their  evil.  Stalin never tried to pass for a social worker.  Castro never  pretended to belive in freedom.  Al Capone knew he was a bad guy and acted  accordingly. But the idea of presenting them as moral equivalents - well,  maybe I don't have the literary &quot;taste&quot; to appreciate such a  concept.  God, how I wish the hero could have been a hero.  Tragic end to a  fine tale.	2000-05-05

This one involves multi-universes, existing (? ) simultaneously and our ability to jump from one to the other.  In plot  it is reminescent of the TV show, SLIDERS, but in style and text it is a  clone of The Man In the High Castle by Philip K Dick - but without that  author's flair.  <br />As usual we are given his fascination with both nazis  and  communists (communist victory is a common thread in more that one of  his books). The story grows slightly confusing and the ending is obviously  botched (endless possiblities?) but for a diversion it will do.  As  other  reviewers have noted, it suffers by lacking a historical setting as a base.   All worlds are alien and different. Please read The Man In The High Castle  for an excellent treatment of this subject.	2000-05-05

With each succeeding volume Boorstin delves deeper into the heart of what it means to be human.  From  Concrete to Theoretical to Conceptual I have avidly followed these books,  reading them several times.  The scholarship is stunning, the writing  fluid, witty and always captivating, and his viewpoint (Western,  Eurocentric) is refreshing in this day and age of presenting all cultures  as morally equal. SEEKERS paints a broad stripe from the dawn of history to  the modern age.  The usual fine biographies (reminescent of Paul Johnson in  his histories) are the icing on the cake.  Also pleasing are the little  plums of new historical facts presented here for  - at least, for me - the  first time.  Read all three books!	2000-05-05

As a boy in Sunday School I had the nerve to ask  who Adam and Eve's children married. (No answer)   As an adult I now know there were no children much less an Adam and Eve  (who was there to record the story?) This book points out the many  contradictions, myths, etc in the Bible.  Yet the polemical style is  absolutely the wrong way to get people to listen.  His work on Jesus is  good but not brilliant. Better is the focus on the  historical and internal  contradictions.  He does, however, cause one to ask, &quot;What is left of  a religion after one has discounted both its scriptures and founder?&quot;  <br />The old argument, &quot;I don't need to believe in a historical Jesus  because I believe in the Jesus of faith&quot; is quite illogical.   Interesting too is that, illogically, the details of Jesus's life increased  with each succeeding book.  From Paul,  writing earliest, who knew nothing,  to Mark, who started when he was a man, to Luke &amp; Matthew as a baby and  John &quot;In the Beginning&quot;. <br />Read the book, ignore the polemics  and have a nice day	2000-05-04

Normally I steer clear of the paranorma but this caught my eye and had LOTS of kudos in the front. The plot got a 5, characters a 4 and  writing a 3. I was surprised at some reviewer's reactions. I saw it  criticized for not being politically correct, for &quot;errors&quot;   (color of oxygen tanks), for being &quot;written for a movie&quot;.

To say &quot;well-written&quot; is an understatement. They are witty, clever, surprising and best of all,  entertaining.  These thick tales hail from a time when ideas propelled a  story - no bad language, vivid sex scenes, inordiante violence.  They are  works of beautiful, well-written prose [by a church organist yet!]  If you  like academic settings (think of Dorothy Sayers) you will love Crispin's  stores	2000-04-15

Anyone who has visited Monticello is struck by what I can only call an 18th century  &quot;laboratory of ideas.&quot;  His incessant tinkering, updating,  adding, replacing demonstrate a vibrant and open mind.  I was struck that  Jefferson did not consider his being President, Sec of State or the  Declaration of Independence author as the REALLY important facts of his  life.  They were the design of a new nation, founding the Univ of Virginia  and last, but certainly not least, as a builder/architect. A wonderfully  illustrated, vivid portrait of the man and his times.  Jefferson was and is  a hero not because of but in spite of his faults.	2000-04-15

I slipped into the bookstore to avoid a  demonstration one day and found this book.  I thought then it was a gem but  have not read it in 27 years.  I picked it up the other day and reread it  and found it as fresh and exciting as the first time.   Both the language  and the spirit of the novel were so refreshingly different from the feel  good, amoral, smirky tone prevalent in current bestsellers.  <br />Anthem is  almost a work of poetry - absolutely amazing considering it is written in a  second language. The book's tone is almost religious, a tribute to the  human, not the divine spirit.  I suspect those writing the most polemical  reviews disagree more with the book's philosophy than the literature.  It  should be offered in junior high and high school as a classic.  For today's  youth (I have two) it may be too intellectual, expect too much from the  reader.  It will be difficult for those with a certain philosophical bent  to enjoy this book. It is uncompromisingly relentless in its vision of a  collectivistic world.  But it also unabashedly rejoices in the  indominatable strenth of the individual. Very good read.	2000-04-10

It is mostly a rehash of popular points of discussion (problem with sources, the oral tradition, who/why/how of the Gospels, the cultural milieu, etc)  Only  towards the end does he finally return to his thesis - that Jesus was an  apocalyptic prophet who expected the end of time momentarily. This  tradition has continued to this day among certain Christian groups.  Yet  the evidence is quite thin - mostly taken from the New Testament which the  author considers rightly suspect due to its theological and literary  evolution.  This is probably the reason that the very late discussion of it  seems almost like an afterthought. My main objection is that the work is  spread too thin and this creates an air of shallowness. I was looking for a  more scholarly work on the order of &quot;The Unauthorized Version&quot; by  Robin Lane Fox.  In fact, if the book were only about the historical Jesus  and his times it might be acceptable.	2000-03-31

Action-packed BUT implausible, plot line interesting BUT dumb, a doctor BUT a murdere. Why could't a Nobel Prize winner create a more humane / faster method for death. But that's all  beside the point since the premis is already dated!   Birth rates around  the world are dropping. Some European countries are actually losing  population &amp; the UN Commission on Population has revised downward world  population projections just the past year.  Also, it is highly implausible  that &quot;women's education programs&quot; will produce the desired  results. For something that massive one needs to modify the water supply in  some countries.  Still, suspend your imagination and read it for the sheer  entertainment.	2000-03-11

I eagerly awaited the conclusion and was slightly disappointed.  Actually &quot;3 1/2&quot; would be my score. Several problems: 1)Emphasis on irrelevant people and events 2) Too many characters. I admit I was lost at times 3) the  &quot;Maria&quot; mystery at the end.  The story essentially became a  futuristic Lost in Space.  <br />I had several questions:  Why did the  apparition continue appearing randomly (no rhyme or reason)? How did the  eagle and the &quot;guiding intelligence&quot; relate to Rama, the  experiment, etc Was the final Maria the &quot;same&quot; Maria? There were  too many jumps in plot, too many gaps. I had more questions than answers at  the end.  Hopefully Rama is concluded.	2000-03-11

What a turn around! From the first sentence I was captivated with the story of quantum displacement (not Time travel as the title implies). All the comments about the \\"absurdness of the plot\\" or \\" that the idea is not clearly explained\\" misses the point. This is a science-fiction chase tale in which literary and scientific license should be bestowed. <br />As in all the author's novels, the weakness is in the characters. The conversations appear very surface (secondary to the plot) and no real relationships emerge-just people thrown together by events. The habit of \\"movieizing\\" the book is becoming annoying. One can almost visualize the director yelling \\"Cut\\" or \\"Action\\". If the middle had not degenerated into a castle chase tale this book would rate an A+. As it is, it's great escapist fare for a cold night.<br />A last word on the \\"scientific\\" aspect. The author's novels are always more intelligent and deeper than the movies. The pattern continues here and it is unfortunate that it will not be present in the movie.	1999-12-30

That theme crops up again and again. The novels are growing in length but not in depth and breadth. Koontz needs to take a time out and develop an original story before dashing out the next one in neck-break time.<br />You want cliches? How about an evil psychiatrist, \\"specially designed drugs\\", the tender, literate blue collar worker with the beautiful wife, the emotionally and mentally crippled helpless souls, the victim no one believes, the satanic parents, etc. Considering it all, it is a suprise the story turned out as well as it did. <br />It is presented in his classic \\"switch action\\" technique - his story / her story / his story... The premise of drug induced zombies has been approached from almost every conceivable angle and this one is far from original. One detects previous works in each book and this is no exception. So many have been released that repetition cannot be avoided. The bad guys are remarkedly similar. <br />The trouble with popular authors is the eventual slide from quality to quantity. I am not asking for an Elizabeth George or Bram Stoker. I do ask for a little imagination and originality. The author has shown he is capable of creating works of great power (The Watchers, Strangers, Lightning). He owes his public something more.	1999-12-30

Itexudes \\"cinema\\" on every page - The story is flimsy (a farce really) and the action is so predictable that I guessed the end of each chapter midway through. One can detect the scenes written with the (new) movie in mind. Compared to the first book, all is lacks is credible science, mystery, believable characters, and a plot. Once again, the author is at his worst with character development - you just can't feel close to any of these cartoon action figures. Here's hope for a better job next time.	1997-06-14

This book takes a differenet turn than the previous ones though.  Whereas the others are almost puritanical in their expression (A Great Deliverance had only two curse words tha I remember) this one explores a seamy side with stunning effect.    E George is the absolute master of integrating disparate, seemingly unrelated events into a single coherent story while developing the most realistic characters in fiction.

It has an innocence not found in  the later tomes.   An instant read - and one that can't be put down - it's a non-didactic Rand who is writing a story - not a polemic.
