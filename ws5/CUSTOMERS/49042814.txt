The big advantage of this chapter in their fictional lives over previous ones is that Agatha Christie does not have them embroiled in a rather weak political/spy drama, naive politics always being a flaw in her writing.  This is actually one of better of Christie's mysteries with many wonderfully dark ideas throughout that provide more fun than the usual stock amount of red herrings.  This book effectively combines the dark deeds of the author's later books with the sense of fun of the earlier ones which can sometimes be lacking in the later Christies.	2005-10-13

The work basically covers Jack Kirby's extraordinary time in the comic book industry from its beginnings until his final years.  It is a fascinating journey that gives the author much room with which to play and he does very well.  The stories may be often be familiar but the book presents them well and en masse.  The author does an especially good and thorough job of tracing the creation of Marvel comics and the lingering debate over proper credit for authorship.  It all makes for a very entertaining read.	2005-10-11

This new book takes place a number of decades after her well-done King Philip's War while still being set within the context of the colonial period of American history.  This time the author looks at an urban setting, New York City, and the peculiar institution of slavery, particularly the so-called slave rebellion of 1840 which resulted in the burning and hanging of dozens of African American and a few white.  The sources are scanty, mainly relying on the printed pamplet of one of the judges, but Lepore does an impressive job of opening up the entire examination to effectively demonstrate how the trials were also about the meaning of liberty and the development of parties.  Both of these ideas would grow and develop, ultimately, into the American Revolution.  The author does a beautiful job of straddling the fine line between a popular work and a work of academic history.  A fine job.	2005-10-11

It is somewhat pointless to discuss who the true Nancy Drew (or more properly, the true Carolyn Keene) because it obviously took a combination of factors to shape the world's most famous and beloved girl sleuth and the author of Girl Sleuth is adept at demonstrating this.  The book is, at first, slow and feels puffed out a little in the beginning before the actual creation of Nancy Drew but when the star takes the stage the narrative speeds along through the changing decades.  It is not the most excitingly written of books, but the story is a truly a fascinating one, even for more of a self-professed Hardy Boys fan such as myself,but it is clearly and intelligently written.	2005-09-30

Most of what is great about the later X-Men have their origins here, even if their creators do not seem to quite be fully aware of what they have wrought.  From Magneto to the Sentinels, from the reintroduction of Ka-Zar to the Juggernaut, these were great stories with nice arc and well developed suspense.  They show the maturity the creators had developed by the time they came to develop the X-Men.  The sad part of this volume, though, are the final issues with wordy stories by Roy Thomas at his least creative (the Locust, Count Neferia and his forgotten villian brigade) and poor art by Werner Roth. All the uniqueness of the X-Men is drained away and they become second stringer heroes.  How wonderful to have those first stories again, though.	2005-09-27

The author does play around with politics in her conservative, often very naive, way but handles it much more smoothly than she did in her early twenties spy novels.  The solution to the killer is both predicatable and satisfying as Christie crawls right up to the preposterous and then pulls back just a little.  This is one of the Poirot novels that could have used Hastings a foil and his prescence is sadly missed, particularly as everyone at a certain dentist's office on a particular morning has something to hide and it would have been fun to read Hastings switching prime suspects with each new revelation.  All in all, not a classic Christie but an interesting one.	2005-09-27

It is a powerful story and is ably suited for the book form with its sweeping arc of great success (winning six Pulitzers early) and then a great scandal followed by defeat and resignation in tight twenty-one period (although the author kindly expands this a little to give the reader context concerning life at the Times).  The troubled writer Jayson Blair fits into this narrative but it is definately not his story.  Besides being both gripping and informative, this is also a book for anyone who cares passionately about the concept of unbiased news, an idea that is sadly almost becoming quaint and old-fashioned in this new Fox-centric universe.  This is also a story for those who actually care about the New York Times because despite its troubled period, the passionate people who work at this paper come out very well in this book.  It is a book that is hard to put down, a tale told well by Seth Mnookin.  Highly recommended.	2005-09-21

Will in the World is a book to be savoured slowly but when that proves impossible, it is best then to simply devour with delight.  The author is best at setting a context for the both the man and his works.  A great example among many is his examination of the tension between Prostentants and secret (sometimes less than secret) Catholics which is brilliant without getting bogged down in conspiracy theories stranger than the actual conspiracies around.  Greenblatt realizes that Shakespeare and his time are interesting enough in the telling.  Even simple domestic life becomes intriguing and charming in this wide-ranging book.  This a history and a biography that will be treasured by readers for a long while to come.	2005-09-16

Marvel's Essentials has once again come to my rescue and I now have the Essential Killraven, while not very essential in and or itself, but still a treat with reservations.  The series got off to a rocky start as the creative team shifted, including both quite weak work from Herb Trimpe and an excellant origin issue by Neal Adams.  It finally settled down with Don McGregor and P. Craig Russell (except for a few regrettable fill-in issues).  Unfortunately, the storyline itself meandered along with the characters as they took an impossibly roundabout route to Yellowstone National Park (which they did not ever get to).  Some of the interesting creations only lasted an issue or two and most of the secrets and personalities of all the characters never had time to be developed properly.  The artwork was always interesting, though.  Still, despite all that, this is still a fascinating example of Marvel's seventies experiments and the Essentials is perfectly designed to showcase a series such as this.  In the end, worth picking up.	2005-09-14

The combatants in this contest are Cook and Peary, both claiming to have reached the Pole and, perhaps, both lying.  This book makes a good case for Cook having actually achieved the set goal and an even better case for Peary never having stepped on the ever-shifting north pole.  Bruce Henderson gets the tale off to a gripping start and keeps the story rolling quickly along.  In Peary, the author has one of the true villains of polar exploration and the author milks it out beautifully and powerfully.  It was almost hard to read at times as Peary's arrogance grew gigantic after learning that Cook was headed for the Pole.  A true tragedy captured nicely in this book.	2005-09-14

At first, the mystery is quite intriguing, particulary as I have a love of anything concerning the Antarctic, although it begins to sound like a lecture at moments.  That is a problem many of these books have.  Once upon a time people would have written a non-fiction Chariot of the Gods or Holy Blood/Holy Grail to posit their often charminly odd theories.  Now in the wake of The Code of Four and the Da Vinci Code creating a fictional mouthpiece is the way to go.  Something is lost or forced in the transition, such as the workings of a true suspense novel with situations and people who exist for reasons other than to spout ideas.  The characters are a little wooden in this particular book but perhaps no more so than something like the Da Vinci Code. Where the author, Thomas Greanias, goes most off-kilter is continually increasing the number of people who know about what is happening before it even began happening until it enters a whole world of silliness on its own.  The premise is not terrible and is even somewhat interesting but the execution is a little regrettable.	2005-09-14

The story of the Aquarius Attilius has a double does of forboding, one of which the character is aware (that something suspicious is going on with a missing Aquarius and questions about the water supply, a nice Chinatown the movie touch lending a degree of noir charm to the book) and one of which the reader is very clearing aware and the author makes clear at the beginning of each chapter (the imminent explosion of the volcano).  When said event does happen, all hell breaks loose and all stray bits of plot come together very nicely.  Pliny makes an inevitable, yet very effective, appearance.  If there ever is to be a noir-historical-disaster novel genre, let this book set its standard.	2005-08-31

It all happened very quickly and with thousands of people watching.  It is still an unbelievable and somewhat inexlicable tragedy.  The author stretches the story out with the interesting stories of recovery and the not alwasy as interesting perspective of the funeral directors, one in particular.  Still, Bonansinga has a good story in the Eastland and he manages to pull it all together very nicely.	2005-08-26

It can be argued even more persuasively that if it did, in fact, need a sequel, it could have none better than his City of the Dead.  This book continues exactly where the last ended and the situation still feels as hopeless, perhaps even more so, although this book is filled with a little more of a love for humanity than the previous one (although the zombies distinctly do not share any of that love.)  The action is intense and virtually non-stop, the most interesting characters from the first book are back with some quite nice additions (such as the Trump-like megolamaniac figure).  The gore is also quite in evidence again, although readers of the first book will probably have grown a little numb to it by now.  A nice addition to zombie literature.	2005-08-24

Laurence Gonzales has made a nice selection of survival tales and presents them in a very useful and illustrative manner.  The author shoehorns himself in a little too much (particularly as humility is supposed to be one of the main virtues possessed by a survivor.)  These true tales make a nice balance and counterpoint to much of the fascinating scientific research.  The book does ignore anything that does not help its thesis so luck is downplayed as is the fact that non-survivors, who tales cannot be told, may often experience and exhibit the same charateristics as survivors, such as a sense of humour, but time was never on their side.  Still, it makes for great reading and, despite the author's final insistence that survivors are born, may offer many useful tips for mental attitude adjustments during a hike or a climb gone wrong.	2005-08-18

The endless bickering (often substituting for deeper characterization) and the constant defence of Invisible Girl's rather weak abilities can get a little monotonous when all the issues are read together but Stan Lee and Jack Kirby make up for it with a great host of wonderful villains (with a very low ratio of duds), including the Silver Age introduction of the Sub-Mariner, Dr. Doom, Red Skull, the Skrulls, Puppet Master, the Thinker, Molecule Man, and Impossible Man.  Also evident is the cross-polination of series with both the Hulk and the Ant-Man making memorable appearances creating a feeling of an actual, specific universe.  The dazzling depths of future adventures is only just glimpsed with a Dr. Doom's story expanding into two issues and the appearance of both the Watcher and the Super-Skrull.  Still, even in this somewhat embryonic stage it is easy and very exciting to see where the Fantastic Four were heading.	2005-08-16

And that place is a Study in Scarlet, Arthur Conan Doyle's introduction of Holmes and Watson, who are already remarkably quite complete in terms of all their personality tics and quirks.  The book's beginning is quite fascinating as the mystery is  bloody and mysterious, chock full of clues and red herrings, lacking only anything resembling a suspect.  The actual solution is, sadly, quite long-winded and hopelessly silly and the way in which Holmes solves the case is also fairly preposterous with much actually left unanswered.  Still, much can be forgiven as this is the story that gave birth to the legend of Sherlock Holmes and there were many stories in the future that would live up to that great myth.	2005-08-16

It is also filled with the author's new agey search for meaning in earthquakes.  And therein lies the problem in that these two parts do not always mesh well.  The reader may become quite fascinated with the X-Files (a group of files at USGS containing predictions of earthquakes sent to them, many of them quite loopy) when the author will interrupt to discuss how these predictions are making him feel.  Sometimes this can work and others times, not so much.  An author such as Sarah Vowell can often manage to merge dark history with light musings with one consistent voice easily.  David L. Ulin has more trouble keeping his authorial voice as even and at times rambles a bit over the same territory.  There are many interesting things to learn about earthquake prediction (or, more accurately, the lack thereof) and the reader will definately feel the title of the book.  Much of it will ring quite true for anyone who has experienced an earthquake.  A pleasant read with many things to recommend it.	2005-08-16

All the creators and performers come alive vividly (and lovingly) in this marvelous book.  The author traces the entire rehearsal, out-of-town tryout, and preview period of the musical Follies, focusing only on what he himself witnessed and recorded as a twenty year old gofer with the show.  What is quite remarkable is his fairness to everyone involved.  Even the divaish moments of some are balanced with these very same personalities more human moments at others.  Anyone interested in Sondheim, musical theatre, or the art of putting it together will be delighted with this blow-by-blow account (perhaps a tad too much on rare occasions).  A delightful book.	2005-08-11

These zombies are more intelligent than those from the movies (as is frequently mentioned in the book itself) and they are given the bare bones of a possibly unique origin, but otherwise these lumbering undead will be very familiar.  And that is always the appeal of the zombies.  The sameness of the monsters allows the author or filmmaker to focus on how a various groups of characters react to this world-wide apocalypse and, for this reason, this book is quite good in its telling.  The protagonists that the author selects are interesting enough and the reader will be quite gripped as each of them struggle on until all the stories converge.  The tale being spun may be very familiar but it is told with such great graphic gusto that it becomes quite a ride.  I look forward to reading the sequel.	2005-08-09

We had it in us from the start but his delightful book, Candyfreak:  A Journey through the Chocolate Underbelly of America, has created a many limbed chocolate eating monster from what were once mild mannered archivists.  This confection of a book was passed around from one person to another and now we have begun ordering on-line many of the chocolates mentioned.  Not a wise move in August in New York as the candy bars may come sealed with an ice pack but it takes little for that to change.  Not that slicing a melted and then refrozen glop is above us.  This book is a must-read for anyone who can remember a sweet treat from their childhood.  The nostalgia factor alone is enough to recommend it but the reader will also find himself loving the funny, touching descriptions of  the various chocolate bar factories across the nation.  A funny, sweet book.	2005-08-05

J.K. Rowling has ended this newest book in such an exciting and dramatic fashion that it is both richly satisfying while still leaving many unanswered questions.  The new characters are interesting as always if not quite up to the level of the previous books.  The romance quotient is bumped up a notch for many of the characters, which is appropriate and handled well.  But the best thing about the newest Potter book is the driving speed of the narrative and the creeping sensation of darkness overwhelming everything.  Rowling keeps up this sense in clever ways even during what would have been ostensibly brighter moments.  A real treat.	2005-08-04

The Golden Age was long gone and the Silver Age was coming to an end.  The space was being filled by all sorts of writers and artists who grew up on the Marvel Age of the sixties and were trying to capture it or subvert it as werewolves, barbarians, vampires, man-things and ghost riders shared the stage with the super-heroes.  It is somewhat of a stretch to know which category Howard the Duck fit into but it is even more surprising that it happened within the Marvel Universe itself at all ,and would sometimes guest star a character from said world, such as Spider-Man, the Man-Thing, or the Defenders.  Steve Gerber did his best work on this series as it was the only comic book that was entirely appropriate for his style.  His days with the Defenders were never a good fit and his time with the Man-Thing are best forgotten.  Gene Colan also did some of this best work with this series, second only to his Tomb of Dracula.  It is one of the delightful suprises of the series to see how Colan was able to go from the darkness of one to the visual humour of the other.  The Essential Howard the Duck is a beautiful glimpse into the seventies at their most unique.  It is wonderful that in a world of super-heroes and monsters, for one brief, shining moment a duck walked amongst them and, on occasion, soared above them.	2005-07-29

Bacon is an interesting character and his story is quite fascinating and fairly well told but it is to the reader's benefit that the book is able to include, through its history of the manuscript, a host of other characters ranging from the court of Elizabeth to World War I cryptographers, and beyond.  Francis Bacon is even wedged in there a bit.  Sometimes the books feels a little padded but this padding, at least, keeps the reader's attention as the centuries are spanned.  A pleasant read.	2005-07-29

Four children find a wardrobe that leads to the magic world of Narnia, where it is always winter but never Christmas.  The White Witch holds sway over the land but Aslan is growing near.  With this delightful premise, a series was spawned (although, of course, chronologically the later written Magician's Nephew comes first).  C.S. Lewis, in the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, was less concerned with explanations than in the other books and more interested in tale-telling, and this he does marvelously, making this one of the very best of the entire series.  This book has rightly become a classic and re-reading it years later, one forgets how much magic is wrapped up in this fast-moving, narratively simple story.  Always a delight.	2005-07-29

The history of the discovery is told for all its glory and each chapter highlights a different personality related to the realization that the world has been through, and will continue to go through, a series of ice ages.  The science is explained very neatly and the story is driven by the series of discoveries, beginning with Louis Agassiz to the very latest scientific discoveries, including alternate theories.  The author also brings the story forward.  All in all, a fascinating glimpse into our world, past, present, and future.  Ice is a nice thing to think about on a hot summer day and this is just the book to get one truly thinking.	2005-07-29

The puropose of each of these drawn out examples is to show the readers the variety of ways an historical researcher can set about determining the truth.  The book's strength is in the variety of cases examined and the quite different investigative means used.  The author, Joe Nickell, uses a number of cases he was personally involved in, although without bogging the stories down with too much personal data.  The focus always remains on the mystery at hand.  It is a small book and an easy read but it should leave the reader with a greater interest in the mysteries of the past and the possible answers they may someday reveal.	2005-07-11

The mystery itself is a bit silly and a bit fun.  It takes Agatha Christie's usual secret society silliness and tweaks it a little while she, for a change, pooks fun at the genre of which she has been such a part in the twenties.  The action bounces between three country homes and a club in London so that it never veers too far from territory the author is comfortable in.  The character are, therefore, a little more stock than usual but she does get a chance to give Bundle (Lady Eileen Brent) a chance to shine that the character never quite got in the previous book.  A slight, nice slice of summer reading.	2005-07-08

Her thrillers, never Agatha Christie's strong point, got a little better and this one does show improvement over the previous ones.  Her love of secret societies overturning the government was ever slightly toned down and humanized and she added her lighter, comedic touches in the Tommy and Tuppence style with her great use of estates and manor houses.  As a mystery is does not compare to Poirot or Marple and as a thriller, many did it better.  But for a pleasant, summer read it is just fine if one looks past the class and race prejudices of Christie's era, of which is completely a product.	2005-07-07

Leonard's Lincoln's Avengers is a different sort of Lincoln murder book.  It does have all the usual suspects and covers all of their details adequately, particulary the issues surrounding Mary Surratt.  The book's strength, however, is to look at the events through the eyes of Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt as a way to see the tragedy not so much as the last gasp of the Civil War but as the first shot in the battle over Reconstruction.  If nothing else, and there is much else, it gives the reader a chance to clearly glimpse a lesser known figure of history in Holt.  The most riveting sections of the book involve his determinatin to avenge the murder, as well as all the other injustices he saw from the civil war, as Andrew Johnson devises an entirely different plan for the South.  A powerful and important addition to books on the this fascinating period of time.	2005-07-07

The Defenders is one of their better choices for an Essentials package.  Speaking of one of the eager fans who was around at the time, one was not aware there was this non-team grouping appearing throughout various of  magazines until suddenly Marvel Feature #1 appeared.  Now the stories can be gathered and enjoyed in a running sequence as originally presented throughout the magazine of the Hulk, Dr. Stranger, and the Sub-Mariner.  The added plus is that then one also gets the best of  original Defenders comic book series, including the introduction of Valkyrie, Nighthawk becoming a hero, and the justly famous Defenders-Avengers battle.  The only thing keeping this volume from being perfect is that it could not have stretched a little farther to include the battle with Magneto and a few of the very good Giant-Size Defenders stories.  Nothing's perfect, but this come blissfully close.	2005-07-07

Rudbeck comes across more self-delusional than either the mad or genius of the subtitle but either way it is an interesting story.  He found Atlantis in ancient Sweden, which also became the birthplace for all language, mythology, and culture known throughout classical Europe (and later stretched to the Indus River itself by Rudbeck).  There was nothing this man could not interpret to meet his needs for fitting into a particular hypothesis. At times, the reader may even feel a little embarassed for Rudbeck and a little shocked that less scholars were not laughing at him.  The author gives a good glimpse into post Renaissance, pre-Enlightenment Sweden, a country not much discussed in most histories.  Sweden was at the height of its power and maybe from so high up it was easy to imagine that everything glorious that was once existed there first.  An interesting footnote in history.	2005-07-07

In 1925 a man, Ossian Sweet, is on trial for defending his property after moving into a white neighbourhood and he is defended by one of the most controversial men of his times, Clarence Darrow, but within this story are many strands stretching all across the country entangling many other vivid (and vividly portrayed) personalities.  The author is amazingly effective in bringing into focus this complex story and the reader will be gripped by this true tale as both the KKK and the NAACP drift by.  It is an intense, powerful read that shows, in many ways, how we got to where we are and how we have not gone as far as was once dreamed.  That could be just some of Clarence Darrow's pessimism creeping in but it is hard not to be gripped by any encounter with that man, partiularly as well done as the one in this book.  A very good piece of history.	2005-06-22

This is not the place to come to get a good biography of any one of these women (Marion Meade's book on Dorothy Parker is a delightful place to begin for that) nor does it capture its time period as well as some other similar books (To Be Young Was Very Heaven about women in New York before the First World War) but there is still great delight to be found in these pages as one skims through the lives of these rather amazing women.  If there is not always much bobbed hair as promised, it is made up for by great heaping quantites of bathtub gin, among many other libations.  As well as many romances, a few abortions, great literary successful, and some professional failures.  It was a time and it still makes for a wonderful read.	2005-06-20

A History of the Scriptures Through the Ages	Books	4	24	28	N	N	Beautifully and Clearly Written History of the Bible	Jaroslav Pelikan has written a superb book for those interested in an elegent and shortish history of the scriptures through the ages from an oral tradition until the historical/contextual/linguistic debates of the 19th century.  The author takes an expansive view, bringing in many different viewpoints while always slyly making his own views known.  For such an obviously learned writer, he manages to make the book quite clear and comprehensible for the general reader, as well as still intellectually challenging for those with a little more knowledge on the subject.  The author ended the book with a more personal, powerful examination of the Bible, beyond the preceding academic debates, as a moving spiritual document that even this non-believer was touched by.	2005-06-17

This one, Treasury of Deception, is just what it's title implies and is broken down into categories and ranges from prison escapes to scientific frauds, from practical jokes to deadly hoaxes, such as the blood libel.  It is a truly odd mixed bag and should be read over a long period in many small bites, although that may prove harder to do than anticipated and one may find oneself gobbling the whole thing down at once.  The book is light at the right moments and more serious when required and, amazingly enough, never veers into the truly silly, which is a blessing.	2005-06-14

The author brings a broader perspective to play in her discussions as she shows that the changes in Provincetown, in many ways, mirrored the changes in America at the same time.  But she also shows the ways in which Provincetown was, and is, unique.  At times the book can be a little dry and could have used a little more colour in its history (such as Provincetown's 19th spiritualist movement) and less focus on almost everyone who owned a guest house in the last couple of decades.  A nice portrait of a great town.	2005-06-09

It is still fun and slightly creepy, though, and the author does avoid the more famous sea tales, such as the Mary Celeste, and sticks to stories the readers is less likely to have heard.  Taken with a often large grain of salt, the tales ring true within the context of this book.  The author does a good job setting the scene and telling the story, although so often ending the short narratives with a question can, at times, get a little grating.	2005-06-01

The author examines tuberculosis, an early 20th century outbreak of bubonic plague in San Francisco's Chinatown, trachoma at Ellis Island, typhus on the Mexican border, and Haitian refugees with AIDS.  He also looks at his own repsonse when a possible case of cholera may be uncovered in Detroit.  The author's historical perspective helps make his points all the more clear.  We live in a global environment, even more so than in these cases from the past, and the spread of these diseases will have to be tackled at their source through interational coordination financed by the richer nations.  Attacking the victims of the disease will be no more effective now than it has been in the past, nor does it go to the root of the problem, such as no access to clean water.  This is a powerful little book, particularly the chapters on Chinatown and the Mexican-American border, both in the first decade and a half of the twentienth century. An important read that is both frightening and very cautiously hopeful.	2005-05-19

It is not a great puzzler but it is a pleasure.  Lady Angkatell is one of the best eccentrics that Christie ever created and she criss-crosses the story in her zany manner, keeping the mystery light.  This novel belongs in the mid-range of Christie mysteries as it lacks truly bizarre red herrings or an ending so impossible it almost charms.  This is a straight forward story but the author still has fun putting her touchingly stock characters through their appropriate paces.	2005-05-18

The author has taken the musical, in a decade by decade series, from the twenties and into the current crop of shows.  The last volume to be published in this series is Sing for Your Supper, the Broadway musical in the 1930s.  It is an improvement over the last two volumes and a return to the good work of the previous editions.  The two problems with the book, though, are the author's need to spend as much time on an Encores version of a thirties show as the original show itself and, at times, the author's boredom with the thirties as a time of no particular historical interest for the historian of Broadway musicals.  When an author seems to lose interest on occasion, it makes it harder for the reader to maintain his.  Still, it is a satisfying concluding volume with all of the author's wit, insight, opinions, and general knowledge well-displayed, mixed in  with little gems of trivia for the musical fan.	2005-04-28

But the even better news is that the author does much more than that.  This book is a fresh look at American secularists and their impact on American society and the struggle to disown either them entirely (such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton in the early feminist movement) or the secular element in their ideas (as is continually happening with the Founding Fathers, such as Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams, never mind the ever prickly Paine) or to allow them to quietly disappear (as is the case with Ingersoll).  The author places these people back into an historical narrative that follows the origins of the American government as a secular body and the continuous fight to change that.  Some of the personalities feel slight shoe-horned in, such as Lincoln, but this, on the whole, is a bold and exiciting book with a frightening ending as the religiously correct break down the wall established at the beginning of the founding.  This story is timely but reading it, one realizes that it always has been.  A well done work.	2005-04-26

The author, Jonathan Kirsch, posits an interesting theory as he explains that polytheism was generally based strongly on tolerance but it fell continously under the more intolerant weight of monotheism as described in these chapters.  The author makes a clear and compelling case.  The book is a little too breezy at times and could have used a little more heft in the arguments but it is still a good read for anyone interested in learning the history of religion from a different viewpoint.  It is way past time the pagans were heard from in history instead of simply talked about.  They have much to say and it is often quite valuable.	2005-04-20

The amazing achievment about The City is that it actually, for the most part, works both in the sense of being an entertaining read and in its ability to convey many salient points about the growth of cities in terms of sacredness of place, the role of commerce, and the need for security.  Many examples of a great variety of citites throughout history are examined using these basic points.  This format is not able to draw out the arguments as thoroughly as many could otherwise have been but the author is very able at expressing his ideas succintly.  Another valuable addition to a great series.	2005-04-20

At least, that is, for those people who get her.  Her books are always a pleasure but Assassination Vacation is, by far, her best yet.  Just when you think that only you alone look at history in the same obessive, personal way along comes someone who is even more quirkily, even charmingly, obessed.  After being ridiculed for ordering a T-shirt with Lewis Powell's image and the word \\"MAD\\" on it and then having to explain to people who this is and what it  means (and not daring to mention that, despite his quite heinous act, finding Powell a little dreamy), it was with great pleasure to read the author discuss him in slightly similar terms.  She makes me a little less embarassed to be a history nerd of long standing.  So many of her pilgramiges throughout the book seem very real to me and she brings such life and humour into her personal quests that the reader may be left with as strong a passion for history as the author, which is a glorious thing.  History is never dead, least of all when Sarah Vowell gets ahold of it.	2005-04-06

She filled the mystery with many interesting characters and gave the reader two narrators who both are surprisingly interesting and funny in their own unique ways.  It is nice to go back to this early mystery and find a successful author discovering her voice.  Christie stills insists on filling the story with improbable romance (and, quite frankly, she always did) but, that aside, this is an exciting little tale that travels from England to South Africa with a wonderfully thrilling interlude about a ship.  A must for Christie fans.	2005-03-30

Maybe it is not much more than beer, hockey, and beavers that make us so special but maybe that is more than enough if some combination of those three things make a people set up universal healthcare, be very polite to one another, and wear toques.  After a long time in the United States, this book was a sweet little breath of cooling Arctic air and a chance to laugh at and with my homeland.  A few mistakes pop up here and there but for such a slight book it provides a number of laughs and that is a good thing, eh.	2005-03-28

Lewis' The Magician's Nephew is delightful in its own right.  Originally, it explained much that had delightfully gone before, although now tha if is it being sold as first in the series, it sets the stage for much that goes after.  Either way, the book manages to be quite funny, touching, a little scary while still explaining much of the magic found in the Narnia books, particularly the first one actually written and published, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.  C. S. Lewis handles all the various themes in the book with a light touch and keeps the adventure moving along swiftly.  Along with The Last Battle, it is among the most obviously Christian of the books but it still keeps a tight grip on itself as first and foremost an entertaining fantasy story for children.	2005-03-28

The silly character of Bouncing Boy is also deflated as a nice added touch.  The stories still rely too heavily on the surprise gimmick which gives an interesting cover, such as the concept of the girl Legionnaires attempting the kill the boys, but result in a rather silly conclusion.  Also, the writers still did very little characterization so there is little difference between the various members.  That would come with later authors.  But this volume is interesting and it shows growth from the previous volume.	2005-03-25

It is, by no means, his best work but it is a classic from its time and place and an early indication of his assured fictional voice.  The narrator of the story is pitch perfect as he slowly falls under the spell of Mona in his own hard bitten way even as the reader sees things that he is choosing to not see.  The story is simple and short making for a nice sweet read that never has a chance to lose its momentum.  This is not a classic of the pulp era the way a Jim Thompson novel is but it is still a delight to rediscover the pure pleasure in a style of writing that, despite becoming overintellectualized, is timeless in its value as entertainment.	2005-03-23

This book begins quite weakly with early chapters on such topics as an assorted group of children of stars who fared poorly in Hollywood but the book does eventually take off nicely with later chapters on Lana Turner and Kim Novok and movies such as Sweet Smell of Success and Peyton Place.  The choppy nature of the book makes it feel sometimes like a serious of magazine pieces cobbled together.  Still, overall it will reward the reader who plows through with many interesting anecdotes and thumbnail sketches of Hollywood life in the 1950s.	2005-03-21

Barry Windsor-Smith's gorgeous art is the reason to buy this volume (even without the great colouring that originally enhanced them).  The stories themselves relied a little too heavily on the original pulpy adventures of Robert E. Howard's stories which quickly develop a sameness as Conan battles an often interchangeable group of monsters and wizards.  It is only near the end of this volume that the stories are developed beyond the one-issue format and contain recurring characters (such as the comic book debut of Red Sonja).  Still, in the end, those first issues are a wonder and a great example of 1970s comic book art at its most creative.  Worth picking up.	2005-03-15

This is a remarkable feat as he details every thing from the times \\"Ripper\\" is used in the title of a direct-to-video motion picture to make the mere suggestion of Jack the Ripper to the times when the historical figure makes the bizarre leap into the future on a television show, such as his appearance on the original Star Trek, as well, of course, on the movies based directly on the actual crimes, such as From Hell.  Through all of this, the author gives descriptions of the movies, both as entertainment and as ways of  seeing the true history of the crimes.  The reader will learn much of interest and be amused by the author's opinions.	2005-03-14

But sadly they were never given as strong mystery material as Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot were and have, therefore, languished on the literary sidelines to a great extent.  Their first appearance, in the Secret Adversary, is a good example of this problem.  Christie is weakest when politics are involved and the story is hopelessly naive with the fate of the world being controlled by one man, Mr. Brown, who ultimately is rather easily bested by those two crazy kids of the flapper Twenties, Tommy and Tuppence.  The author never, ever, succeeded in achieving anything remotely approaching a spy thriller.  Still, this book will hold interest for anyone wanting an early glimpse of the crazy duo who are always a pleasure to spend some time with.	2005-03-14

It has it all, money, corruption, shadowy figures, false corpses, and a little sex.  The problem with this book by Leonard F. Guttridge (of the much better and recommended Icebound and Ghosts of Cape Sabine) and Ray A Neff is that these characters, coincidences, schemes, and double dealings are paraded in a brief fashion before the reader resulting in more of a confusion than a sustainable conspiracy.  It seems that everyone (both from the North and the South) was invovled at one point or another for a wide range of multiple reasons.  The whole sequence of events becomes quite chaotic and, in the end, it appears John Wilkes Booth committed murder without any regard to the previous plans, although seems vague as well.  The authors play the usual game of conspiracy theorists by leaving out any facts not suited to their ideas but commit the error of then replacing the missing ideas with a plethora of every shady notion attached to those months, regardless of the contraditions.  A confusing book, that while often interesting, could have used a little more space to fully explain and connect all the dots.	2005-03-11

Their resemblance to the X-Men is obvious although DC was never able to create an environment where the oddball heroes fit in as well with Superman, Batman, et al, whereas the X-Men never seemed out of place in the Marvel universe.  But Doom Patrol's biggest weakness was its lack of stand-out villains.  The X-Men had Magneto and his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants while the Doom Patrol struggled along with General Immortus and the Brotherhood of Evil.  The Doom Patrol stories are still quite charming, though, and show great promise for what could have been.  It was an adventurous experiment at DC to create a team of outcast heroes that is worth checking out.	2005-03-09

The Music of Your Life is a very bittersweet collection about being young and about being old, often in the same story.  The collection may end on a weak note, \\"Wildlife of Coastal Carolina\\", but until then it is very strong with all the stories connected by the lead character being gay and southern, and all that may imply.  Characters from pop culture wander through either in person, such as, memorably, Lucille Ball, or flickering on the television or movie screen, such as Lawrence Welk or Julie Andrews, but the focus never wanders away from the main character.  The author is strongest when a character is looking back to the past from the present.  These moments are very touching even when, maybe even particularly, not much of great import is occuring.  It is a wonderful short story debut.	2005-03-08

The first half of the book is the most fascinating as the stories of the first eighty or so years are not as familiar.  Perhaps too much of the remainder of the book is on the Volpe/Levine years which, though very important and interesting on their terms, will be familiar to many readers. Also the story from the management side, both artistic and business, gets mixed in with the story of many of the later stars singing at the Met as the book progesses, beyond those stories strictly set at the Met, whereas in the beginning the book is much more focused.  Still, it is a thoroughly entertaining read.	2005-03-03

A girl is called for specifically from an agency to be a typist for a blind woman and to let herself into the house as the woman would not be there when the typist arrived.  The stenographer arrives to find a dead man, a multitude of clocks, and the return of said blind woman who never called for a typist and has no idea how a dead man got into her house bringing four clocks all set for about an hour ahead of time.  Hercule Poirot himself only makes three brief appearences in the story making it different from the usual Poirot novel, possibly a disappointment for those fans of the Belgian detective.  The mystery and suspense are sustained throughout and if the reader is willing to suspend a great of deal of disbelief the journey can be fun, if not entirely rewarding.	2005-02-25

One should not make the mistake of reading this book over lunch as the descriptions are accurately nauseating in their thoroughness.  At times, a hint of monotony does creep into the tale as each country's encounters with the swiftly spreading disease is told.  The tale does not vary much and is most interesting in the earlier chapters with the diseases first encounters with Europe in Italy.  The book's strengths are its discussion of recent scholarship on both the origin and the nature of the plague.  It is a gripping story of a most horrific and unimaginable event.	2005-02-24

James has a moodily delightful read with The Murder Room.  The Room itself, part of a museum dedicated to the interwar years in Britain, is full of artifacts of actual historical crimes which become important in the murders which follow, as well as being an effective hook in the beginning of the book to lure the reader forward. This very concept was the driving force for a history buff, such as myself, to pick up the book and return to P.D. James after being away a number of years. The rest of the novel does not let this marvelous lead-in down.  The twists come relatively fast and furious and while often unbelievable are just as often unexpected.  The ending is somewhat of a let-down but with all the various turns and coincidences the plot had to sustain, it could almost not be any other way.  A wonderfully atmospheric and gripping thriller.	2005-02-17

Price has written a compact, fascinating tale that focuses tightly on John Smith, Pocohontas and the first two decades of the Virginia colony in Love and Hate in Jamestown.  The author manages to include much recent scholarship while keeping the narrative quite accesible.  It is not the wonderful romp that Big Chief Elizabeth by Giles Milton is as its perspective is not as large and the writing not quite as juicy.  Still, the tale told by Price is an important one and a he tells it well as he makes a strong case for the veracity of John Smith's account of events and Smith's influence on the future of the country that would become America.  Jamestown is always an interesting story and this book does not fail it.	2005-02-04

In Public Enemies, the author examnies the crime wave of 1933-34, focusing on Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, the Barker-Karpis Gang, Bonnie and Clyde, Machine Gun Kelly, and Pretty Boy Floyd.  He demonstrates how these criminals and their respective crime sprees built the reputation of the FBI and, in essence, created the force as was known for decades afterwards.  The book is a wonderful read and the author even manages to make the seemingly endless stream of bank robberies individually interesting.  The ineptness of the beginning attempts of law enforcement to come to grips with the crime wave is beautifully wrought as is all the networks of connections between the varioujs criminals.  A delightful book that captures a fascinating time.	2005-01-31

Kauffman brings out American Brutus to add to the pile.  And it is a good job that he has.  The story begin with the actual attack and goes chronologically through the rest of the night, setting the stage for the rest of the book, including a vivid description of the Seward slashings, until the death of Lincoln.  The book then covers the part of the story that takes place builing up to the event and then follows with the manhunts and trials aferwards.  It is a thorough and well-told tale with the author providing all the facts in a very informative and entertaining fashion.  He clears up many misconceptions while leaving some issues a little cloudier, based upon surviving evidence (such as the true involvement of Mrs. Surratt).  It is a very engrossing read.	2005-01-13

The authors focus tightly and breathtakingly on the events in and directly around the towers from the moment of the first plane's impact until the last tower comes down.  There is nothing but that story and it is told with great skill from a great many viewpoints, both from workers inside the tower and from rescuers entering the towers.  They combine their account effectively with just enough information for the reader to get a little background into the personalities involved and the various elements that structurally in the towers themselves whiced added to or relieved the crisis.  This book's strong focus on the fight for survival within the towers makes it an invaluable resource and a testement to what happened that day.	2005-01-07

The team grows in fits and starts as seen through other series (Superboy, Supergirl, and Superman) as a strange assortment of teens from the future appear in Smallville and Midvale for a wide variety of odd reasons.  It is hard to keep track of the growing membership as many appear only in the background and main plot points often revolve around a new member appearing for the sake of the story, such as the rather odd Star Boy and the more interesting Ultra Boy storylines.  Only near the end of the volume does the Legion itself get its own storylines and the early issues begin with a bang as the Legion suffers its first death, Lightning Lad.  The promise of greatness is apparent in a few of the stories, if not quite delivered, but this volume is still essential for any Legion fan.	2005-01-06

Skal is as readable as ever is this newly revised edition of the definitive Hollywood Gothic as he covers the history of Dracula from his creation by Bram Stoker to the various and multiple version on screen and stage.  The thrust of the story is, of course, on the novel and the iconic Bela Lugosi movie, with an additional nice, but smaller, chunk on Nosferatu.  The author is particularly effective in combining, in an interesting fashion, the creative, financial, and legal elements.  His analysis is always clear and interesting and will definitely send the reader on a viewing frenzy.  Vampire movies seem always to be streaming forth from Hollywood and Dracula is and always will be the most tempting of the bunch.  This book brings this fascination to life, as it were.  A very good job.	2005-01-04

The author, David Laskin, picks some interesting tales of both survival and death and makes the entire terrifying night come alive.  The full book, though, contains much more than these sequences and feels overly padded as the tales of immigrants arriving in America blend into discussions of how cold fronts move to the history of the weather service and further into quite gruesome accounts of what actually takes place as the body freezes (despite its graphic nature this particular section proves quite important to the story.)  The book pales beside such classics as Isaac's Storm as the pieces do not always move towards creating a compelling narrative.  Still when the blizzard finally hits the various tales of teachers, children, and farmers caught out in it are weaved together quite well.	2004-12-30

It is fine companion piece to Robert S. Wistrich's book on the Holocaust in this same series, Modern Libary Chronicles.  These two books together will give one a frightening picture of the impact of Nazism, first in Germany and then in the world.  Bessel paints a broad picture and, in as much space as these small format titles allow, goes into the economic and sociological impact of Nazisim, particularly after attaining power in the early 1930s, in addition to the more obvious political impact.  The last chapter is particularly fascinating in showing how Nazism and the German people were separated as concepts in post-war Germany as the focus in memory shifted to the last years of the wars with the Germans as victims.  A tidy, concise, frightening read.	2004-12-27

It is an unusual choice as this series of comics barely made a mark of any kind in its own day but, for that reason, this is one of the more oddly enjoyable of the Essentials.  As an older reader of comic books the Essentials have a strong nostalgic value but this particular one does not as I did not read a single issue as it was originally published and I feel like I am coming at it fresh.  It is quite inconsistent in tone (a marked departure from Tomb of Dracula and a strong reason for the succes of one and the invisibility of the other).  The art begins very strong with Mike Ploog but gets much weaker under John Buscema (a stronger artist with super-heroes rather than monsters) and Val Mayerik (although his work in the magazine stories at the end is much stronger than his comics work).  The stories themselves wander through the centuries and only pick up a momentum and a supporting cast in the final issues of the comic book.  The character and intelligence of the monster himself varies widely and the inconsistenices, in general, are often quite glaring.  But, despite its flaws, this is a brave choice for an Essentials volume and an interesing look back on the monster comics craze that swept Marvel.  Where else, outside of a old Universal movie, could one have such fun seeing the Monster battle Dracula and the Werewolf (By Night).	2004-12-24

The author, in Over the Edge of the World, covers the entire expedition and gives Magellan a fair shake, both good and bad, in such aspects as his navigation skills, his leadership, his dealings with various tribes, and his use of religion. The main chronicler, but not the sole one, was Pigafetta, a passenger on board, and his voice rings through this book in a useful and fascinating way. An interesting book.	2004-12-19

O'Donnell tells a horrific tale in Ship Ablaze.  In a matter of minutes a steamboat full of a German-American church group went from enjoying a ride down the East River on a beautiful day towards picnic grounds to fighting for their lives as an inferno consumed the lives of over a thousand people, mainly children and women, through fire or drowning.  The very life preservers themselves became instruments for the deaths of many as it dragged them straight to the bottom of the river.  The author does a magnificent job of setting the scene for the tragedy but his best work comes in the description of the disaster itself.  It is heartbreaking and breathtaking and impossible to pull away from.  This book is a wonderful memorial to a time and event that should not ever be forgotten.	2004-12-16

Anderson's The Game of Sunken Places is way beyond far-fectched, even for the genre of fantasy, as two boys embark on a  board game that leads them to hidden cities, trolls, and ghosts, among many other fantasical things.  The author keeps the story moving quickly and has some nicely timed twists and turns along the way to keep the reader's attention.  This is a good thing as the holes within the plot could be jarring if one is not swept quickly past them.  The sense of whimsy demonstrated at the beginning sags slightly as the book gathers steam but it is replaced with a greater touch of danger at just the right moments.  Overall, this is a enjoyable children's fantasy if not a classic.	2004-12-13

The author uses each of the characters as a springboard to examine both our contemporary society and, using various of the episodes, to strongly critique aspects of the same.  When The Simpsons succeeds, which was once every time and now is still quite often, it could ably satrize sources of authority and puncture all of their pretensions quite nimbly.  The author very powerfully proves the case for this throughout his exhaustive book.  It is delightful to see such a serious analysis of such a funny show and an even bigger delight to have it work so well.	2004-12-09

Turner, queer (a too lengthy discussion of why \\"queer\\" and not \\"gay\\" erupts in the middle of the book, which is a relief from the even lengthier discussion of a flaneur, by way of Baudelaire) cruising in the streets of New York and London is drained of sex.  This is a fairly passionless treatise in general that is short on historical content but waist deep in literary references, although often not to cruising but to an examination of queering urban spaces in a far more general sense.  The discussion on Walt Whitman is often inciteful and interesting but veers off topic as Whitman's influence on more recent gay artists is presented.  This is a intelligent, academic, often dull piece that never brings the reader a sense of history as actual events take a backstage to literary and artistic representations.	2004-12-08

This history is far more about the business (and, hence, the gangsters of the sub-title) than creative side oriented but the author makes it all quite enjoyable.  His portraits of Jack Liebowitz, Harry Donenfeld, and Siegel and Shuster (the original geeks of the sub-title) are actually quite gripping and even, at times, very touching as he takes them all from kids to old men, bringing their creations, particularly and alway Superman, along with them.  It is a twisted story that is presented clearly, with humour and insight.  A highly recommended book.	2004-12-06

Fergus Fleming does another great job at painting a picture of heroic adventure and daring discoveries that filled in some bland spots on the map in the early eighteenght century but achieved little of scientific or economic valure at the cost of a great many lives.  Barrow's Boys is not truly a biography of Sir John Barrow but a look at all the explorations he launched during his tenure as Second Secretary to the British Admiralty.  All the greats are here from William Edward Parry to James and John Ross, from John Rae to Lady Jane Franlin and John Franklin.  The destinations range from Africa to the Arctic with shorter excursions to the Antarctic and Australia.  It is a thrilling ride with much foolhardiness, some bravery, and a spot of cannibalism or two.  A wonderful read.	2004-11-18

It is a great topic for this small format and the author, Patrick Collinson, handles the job with great intelligence and, surprisingly, a little bit of sly wit.  The book ranges from before Luther and carries the story into the seventeenth century and beyond, but the main focus of the work is  kept squarely on the revolutionary sixteenth century.  The author keeps a balance in his discussion of the topic of the Reformation and the Catholic Counter-Reformation and brings in the work of many previous scholars.  The short format, of course, does not allow for great depth in the theological discourse but the author is effective in  bringing out the important points in an efficient bite-size manner.  A fine piece of work.	2004-11-05

Coraline is also the novel's heroine and she triumphantly joins a long line extending from Alice to Philip Pullman's Lyra.  It is a short read but it is amazing what rich textures the author manages to manipulate in that brief span of pages.  There is not much time for character or plot development and it would have been fascinating to see the author develop the themes he has presented but this novel is perfect in and of itself and one should not want to stretch it out too far.

This is the worst of his books on the various decades of the Broadway musical as the faults of the seventies book have widened into gulfs.  His political ramblings (often just slightly right of Ann Coulter and making as much sense) seep through the book, dragging it down.  The French people are slammed a number of times, along with the ACLU, Burt Lancaster (apparently, according to Ethan a good friend of Stalin) and the left in general, while the author defends Bush (and it does take some looking back over the page to figure out how he fits all this into a book on musical theatre).  The author's train of thought wanders like a bitter old man  all over the page in search of a target, any target.  It is often hard to stomach.  The truly sad fact about this is that the author often has quite cogent things to say about a particular musical and when he does stick to that, it can actually make one want to look at the work again.  An editor should have cleaned the work up before before allowing it on stage to greet its public.  The author is capable of better work.	2004-11-02

The mystery is never very threatening or suspenseful (or, for that matter, mysterious) and it relies far too heavily on coincidence for its momentum.  But is it still a joyful read if only for listening to the narrator Maggie's inner voice and her boss', C.B. Greenfield, outer one. The author uses her skills learned in writing comedy sketches for television to keep the slight story moving in a gentle, humourous fashion that may appeal more to readers of domestic comedies of an earlier generation (think Shirley Jackson's Raising Demons) than mystery readers.  A little joy.	2004-09-01

The story of the shipwreck and fight for survival (mostly unsuccessful) of the Grosvenor's castaways is a harrowing one, particularly as told in Taylor's account.  The reader will also learn bits of colonial India history, early shipping, African exploration, and tribal relations sprinkled throughout the main narrative and the different elements are wonderfully captured and made whole.  The author makes the curiously complicated flight for survival, as the one group drifts into several different evolving combinations heading toward such varied fates, more straightforward than it would at first seem, which is a relief.  One of the highlights of the book, though, is its look at those survivors who remained in Africa, as well as those who only possibly may have lived on in Africa.  It is a wonderful adventure story providing a fascinating glimpse into history.	2004-08-17

In other words, much of this book seems aimed at gay men who wallow in the high artistic camp of what All About Eve has become. In this respect, it is quite a thorough joy, as the history of the true story behind the movie is presented, the original short story, and then into the heart of the book, the filming of the movie (Celeste Holm comes in for perhaps too hard a time because of the author's personal feelings towards her and her attitude toward his book. Her actual celluloid performance was perfect.) The remainder of the book follows the growing legend of the film and the creation of the musical, Applause, based on it. It is a breezy, fun read without a single bumpy night in sight.	2004-07-30

It was a series from the mid-70s that I never got hooked on until later and, to be fully appreciated, it must be savoured from the beginning, particularly after Marv Wolfman takes over scripting early on.  It is one long storyline with little or no superheroic elements and, therefore, never got the attention it deserved, much like as happened also to Master of Kung Fu, and now seems to get attention mainly for introducing the character of Blade (a nice character but my personal favourite is Hannibal King, who does not appear until the final issue of this volume).  Gene Colan's pencils have never been put to better use than in the moody stories of Wolfman and the black and white format of the Marvels Essentials is finally not a drawback to enjoying the series.  Tomb of Dracula is well served by this kind of treatment.	2004-07-29

The historical academic puzzle portion of the novel is the richest part and is far less silly, from an historical point of view, than the Da Vinci riddles.  It may somewhat bore readers who do not want any history with their mystery but will definately hold other reader's interests.  The book does falter, though, in the contemporary story of the main characters personal live as so much of it is told slowly through flashback that little suspense is generated.  As a somewhat intelligent summer read, though, this mystery will be of interest.	2004-07-12

His two previous collections brought to life his family and the essays in this volume will not have any surprises for the reader where the Sedaris' family are concerned but one still feels the sharp humour and painfully sweet nostalgia on encountering them all over again, along with the further adventures of little David Sedaris.  This volume does also include other types of stories and, for me, they worked generally as well as the more usual family and life in France essays.  It is hard not to swallow this up in one sitting and that is not a bad thing.	2004-07-12

Give Our Regards to the Atomsmashers includes many different writers examining their passion, both past and/or present, for comics, whether of the superhero or alternative variety, ranging from discussions of Chris Ware to Jack Kirby to Tintin.  The most obvious joy for the reader will be in reading an essay in which a writer finds joy in the same memories you yourself possess but the slyer pleasure comes in reading an essay that will lead you into a new discovery, and, for me, there were many of these essays. Virtually every piece is touching as each one leads a writer to reveal something personal and, for many, so private a thing; a love of comics.  It is a wonderful collection.	2004-07-07

A woman is killed in a plane with eleven other passengers and stewards around her and let us just say that a wasp, a blowpipe, a dart, and snake venom are all involved.  It is an impossible crime (I know this because one character or another says so, frequently) and quite an intriquing one.  Sadly, the conclusion does not live up to the anticipation and Hastings abscence as narrator is sorely missed.  It is always a joy, though, to read Poirot regardless and the book is crammed with many red herrings and a little more romance than usual.  Not top drawer Christie but still a minor pleasure.	2004-07-02

Larson manages to pack this little book.  The author goes beyond the usual small format of the Modern Library Chronicles series only a little in terms of page number but seems to cram much more information in than the readers of this dazzling series usually encounter.  And the joy is that he does it so effortlessly, with scientific jargonize only sneaking in near the very end.  The concept of evolution is covered from Cuvier in the Napoleonic era through Darwin and onto the modern 21st culture wars in America.  Everything important is touched on in a manner that makes it relevant, understandable, and interesting, and the story flows quickly and intelligently.  It is one of the better volumes of the series making the best use of the space allowed in order to introduce important historical ideas and events to the general reader.  A highly recommended read.	2004-06-18

Charles Dickens himself is quoted often and appropriately as the tale winds through the back alleys of rubbish strewn pre-Victorian London, taking in pubs, meat markets, and medical practices along the way.  The author uses the historical facts of the case to explore many of these aspects of this fascinating time and place.  Only very occasionally does the book veer off too far from the case at hand.  Otherwise the author keeps a tight focus on the material and more than keeps the reader's interest through all the spooky twists and turn.  A very nice job.	2004-06-15

Particularly interesting is the author's examination of the how this true tale of terror morphed into an almost legendary event as various myths began to attach themselves to an historical occurence, starting with a story by Arthur Conan Doyle.  The ship's name even changed from Mary Celeste into Marie Celeste in common usage as if in tribute to its own new iconic status.  The book, at times, feels a little padded as the author veers into somewhat related spheres (such as the Bermuda Triangle).  The author, though, does provide a solution that seems to answer many of the unanswered questions and seems far more reasonable than anything put forward previously.  A nice summer beach read as one looks out at the ocean.	2004-06-11

Wood has done another great job in his newest work of history, The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin.  This is not in any way a definitive biography but instead is a more focused work, essentially examining Franklin's move from a lover of the British Empire into an American patriot and then, finally, into an American icon, possibly one of American's most resonant.  Franklin is always a fascinating tale, as his own Autobiography has shown for centuries, and Wood captures the tale of artisan of lowly origins turned into a diplomat at foreign courts with great skill.  The author's look at how Franklin became an icon after his death is very interesting. For those who missed reading the massive biography of Franklin two summers ago, this one is not to be missed.	2004-06-08

For a short biography of Napoleon, take a look at Paul Johnson's slim volume and for a fuller context of Parisian history read Alistair Horne's The Seven Ages of Paris.  This book, the Age of Napoleon, is Alistair Horne's examination of one of those particular ages and the man at the centre of it.  The book is arranged by topics as opposed to a chronological history so basic familiarty with European history will be an advantage.  The author also repeats himself, at times, as the story moves back and forth. But this book will give the reader an idea of these tumultous times and either lead them to further reading about Napoleon the man or work as a refresher to a previously read biography.	2004-05-26

All of her various character types are here, with a clever riff/spoof of both Hercule Poirot and the French detectives he would on occasion encounter.  It is a compact book with a great number of red herrings thrown about, the perfect summer read for those who have already worked their way through the Christe oeuvre a couple times over and have tired of more contemporary psychological thrillers.  This mystery may be way over the top at times but, like a good Agatha Christie, it is always a pleasure.	2004-05-25

Along the way he seems to have fallen completely and hopelessly under her spell.  That is not to say he does not, on occasion, find fault with her (her marriage to Bothwell could never be presented as a smart idea) but he puts up the best defence against Mary's detractors (Cecil and Elizabeth) since the reign of the Renaissance papacy.  This is only occasionally a problem in this otherwise interesting and mammoth book.  Mary has been oft maligned in favour of Elizabeth and it seems, for some reason, one is always expected to choose between these two British queens ruling at the same time and the author makes his choice abundantly clear.  The author covers the complicated factionalism of Scotland with adroitness.  The murder of Mary's husband, Lord Darnley, is handled with more thoroughness in other books (such as Alison Weir's) but this author places the assisnation in its context quite comfortably.  A good book on a fascinating woman.	2004-05-21

Murders strength is also its weakness.  It has a very unusual twist.  That is typical of the Agatha Christie of the superb Murder of Roger Ackroyd and Murder on the Orient Express.  The only problem in this mystery is that, for once, the twist seems a lot more forced, with a group of suspects that are not particularly unique or interesting.  It still is alway good to read about Hercule Poirot and Hastings has returned for this adventure.  And, of course, for those desiring a higher than usual Christie body count, this mystery provides a healthy dose of dead bodies.  It makes for a pleasant summer read but is not up to the usual Christie standards and does not bear up to repeated visits unlike many of the Christie classics.	2004-05-17

It is hard to picture the Dutch here at all, as a matter of fact.  Colonial history has always had such a strong Anglo bias that the Dutch (and New York, itself) never make much impact in the histories of America in the seventeenth century, focusing as it does so often on the Puritans and Pilgrims of New England.  The Island at the Center of the World by Russell Shorto is a successful attempt to correct that for a pop history reading public.  He makes a strong case for the importance of the early Dutch settlers as a harbinger of the future of New York (and hence America) as a multicultural nation that values individual liberties and respect religious freedoms, not values shared by the Puritans farther up north.  His case is frequently overstated and not always backed up with the stongest evidence (cole slaw is mentioned a number of times as a prime example of Dutch influence) but the story he tells of this early colony is a fascinating one that deserves telling.  By the end of the book, it is no longer quite so difficult to picture Manhattan as the Dutch first saw it and fought for it, with the natives, with the English, but, mostly, with each other.  A wonderful slice of New York history.	2004-05-14

It is alway a familiar comfort.  This book is so perfectly Christie.  All of her favourite character types are here as suspects and the action is stripped down to Poirot simply interviewing one of these suspicious characters after another in his own inimitable style.  The solution is joyous, but almost sublimely ridiculous, and many of the clues with which Poirot uses to solve the crime are denied to the reader but still this is one of Christie's more elegant reads (to speak nothing of the perfect film version which even improves on the book).  This is the one to pick up and read again and again to get away from any of the stresses of a long day.  Simply the best.	2004-05-12

The author, in Something From the Oven, does a superb job of taking the idea of a '50s dinner and making it a more complex and multi-layered idea than is usually represented.  She peels away all the stereotypes the decade has been dragging behind it and shows the truth.  Canned and frozen foods(including my mother's favourite, the TV dinner) make appearances but the author show how women did not blindly follow every marketing scheme tossed at them. And Poppy, along with such luminaries as Betty Crocker and Julia Child, help populate this rich tale with great personalities, in addition to the many anonymous readers and letter writers to women's magazines and food columns.  This is a well researched, enjoyable book that makes the 1950s come alive.	2004-05-11

Tom Perrotta captures beautifully people falling into parenthood and a house in the suburbs and the ways in which they all deal with the shock of discovery that it has happened to them.  The story is moved forward by the two leads, Todd and Sarah, having a kiss in the playground that develops into an affair and a child molester moving into the neighbourhood.  The book is quite funny in the beginning as it gets the narrative smoothly flowing.  It is a generous book to all of its secondary characters, even the ones the reader is not supposed to like.  The author also nicely skirts around the melodrama inherent in the situation.  A very satisfying read that captures perfectly how people with children actually behave.	2004-05-07

He is helped tremondously by the likes of Cato, Caesar, Pompey, Sulla, Cicero, and Cleopatra, among many, many other fascinating secondary characters, but it is his highly readable style that moves the story forward in ways that will be understandable for anyone encountering ancient Roman history for the first time and refreshing for those who are returing to this period of history.  This is true pop history in the best sense of that meaning.  The history comes alive in ways that will ring true and unmistakable to any reader now (without ever belabouring the obvious comparisons between the fall of the Roman Republic and our current events.  History is never dead.)  A recommended glimpse into the chaos that became Rome as its ideals for its society were subjugated by a quest for personal glory as its empire and its consequent chances for wealth grew.	2004-04-15

It pales somewhat when compared to its progenitor, Shirley Jackson's far superior Haunting of Hill House.  The author takes Jackson's basic premise (and very similar characters) and throws in more gore, switching psychological suspense for outright physical terror following the same patterns movies had taken in the late sixties following Night of the Living Dead.  Actually this novel is one that reads like it was meant to be filmed.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  It is a chilly little story that is worth a quick read showing the best of the horror genre before Stephen King came along in the mid-seventies.	2004-03-12

Bill Clinton's biggest tragedy as a president was that he did not live through a time of crisis (beyond those sordid ones that he created for himself) because the evidence suggests he could have risen to the challenge with the utmost skill.  He was a truly fascinating politician with an a amazing and powerful love of the game of politics.  This book hits all the high (and low) lights of his reign and often gives a balanced and intelligent assessment.  The author touches effectively on the changes brought to goverment by the arrival of Baby Boomers into government, such as Clinton and his easily bested foe, Newt Gingrich, in order to supply a context for the narrative.  The book is short so it does not dwell on policy issues and cabinet ministers much but it is a nicely done remembrance piece.	2004-03-09

The set up is fascinating with thirty six dead bodies being unearthed from the 1870s before the dead bodies in the present time also start piling up.  The authors keep the pace moving and the tension high, even at points where credibility dips and the twists become a little more predictable.  The horror shifts from creeping terror to gross-out squeamishness and then back again with relative ease.  It is a fast-paced summer type read that makes one wish it was not the depths of February.	2004-03-08

In a very short volume, the author manages to touch on many relevant and interesting points of Shakespeare's life, all of his plays, the history of theatre in his time, and, briefly, even politics and religion in Elizabethean and Jacobean England.  It is a delightfully written and entertaining volume that does what all the best volumes in this series manage to do.  It makes the reader what to learn more, both about Shakespeare and his plays.  The author's insights into the language and styles of the various plays is illuminating, particularly as he gives a historical and literary context for his ideas.  This is a quick, bright, marvelous read.	2004-03-08

It is a dinner party with eight guests and a host.  Four people who may have gotten away with murder in one room playing bridge and four detectives playing bridge in the another room, including the always clever Hercule Poirot and the wacky mystery writer Mrs. Ariadne Oliver.  By evening's end the host and organizer of this odd dinner party is dead and only one of the four possible murderers could have done it.  The author and the four detectives, and thus the reader, have a lot of fun with this conceit.  The book spills its tale quickly and makes for a rapid, wonderful read, even if the denoument becomes a little tangled and far-fetched.  It is a crazy ride worth taking for a few hours.	2004-02-17

Jan Bondeson examines the great (and the lesser great) historical mysteries of the nineteenth century, such as Kaspar Hauser, the Lost Dauphin, and monk-czar of Russia.  He presents all the known evidence in a clear fashion and lays out the possible solutions relying on both modern scientific evidence, if available and applicable, and documentary evidence.  The author may disappoint conspiracy buffs (they always have the internet) but this book will interest history buffs.  These stories are endlessly fascinating and they add up to a marvelous evening or so of reading.	2004-02-06

It is indeed mammoth as it ranges from the paranormal to more historical mysteries.  The authors', Colin Wilson and Damon Wilson, pet theories become abundantly clear as certain themes and concepts are repeated throughout the book, such as their ideas concerning poltergeists which are shoe-horned into far too many of the entries outside of the one for poltergeists.  They also have an annoying lack of scepticsim concerning anything paranormal yet pull away the cobwebs from more historical occurences with great ease.  Still this book will be a treat for anyone looking for a one volume compedium of weird things.  You may roll your eyes at some of their conclusions but you still keep reading.	2004-02-06

David K. Johnson does something different and, in its special way, far more important.  The author, in The Lavender Scare, looks at how the cold war fears were used to hound gay men and women out of the federal service and how this continued unabated long after the Communist hysteria died down.  It is fascinating, and horrifying, to witness how politicians used their fear and ignorance of \\"the perverts\\" for their own political ends and used the fear of Communists as a cover for their attacks.  The case presented in this book is well researched and the voices from both sides are used, even from those voices of the gay men and lesbians which had to be silent at the time.  This books holds valuable lessons (and warnings) for our own fraught times.  A valuable addition to the literature of the history of the Cold War.	2004-01-29

Nuland looks at the strange story of Ignac Semmelweis, the man who discovered the simple means of preventing childbed fever which saved countless lives.  The tragedy of his life was that he never went on to elaborate on a form of germ theory that was backed up experimentation or cogent writings (although he did eventually publish a rambling account of his theories that did more harm than good to his reputation).  The author is best at setting the scene of women dying in lying-in hospitals in all of its graphic and horrific detail, and in demonstrating the ways in which Semmelweis's own intractable personality and the conservative politics of the hospital's at the time worked against him.  The truly great achievment of this man is put into its proper context within its historical time period in a brilliantly succint manner.  A nice addition to the Great Discoveries series.	2004-01-22

Veira has assembled an outstanding collection of photographs to decorate this gorgeous coffee table book.  These dazzling images alone would be enough to recommend this hefty volume but he also provides a fascinating account of the history of the horror film up to the end of the sixties and the death of the production code by which time fullly realized gore (think Night of the Living Dead) took over.  The cover of the book features Boris Karloff and that is as it should be.  His career spans the period of this book and his work over the years exemplifies the changes in the horror movie.  The account of him throughout this volume bears a fitting tribute.  The only shortcoming of this book is the space devoted to such movies as 2001:  A Space Odyssey, but everyone will have an opinion on a movie here or there that should have been omitted or added.  A fine volume.	2004-01-20

This book is a delight with its large, colourful drawings and its bouncy rhythm.  The added joy of the plush toy dinosaur with its little teddy bear and its blanket knocks this book over the top.  The larger size stuffie is the better choice over its smaller version but either will continue the book's pleasure.  Another little jewel of this picture book are the images on the front and back covers of a variety of dinosaurs with their actual names.  This book is a keeper.	2004-01-20

Many recent books are available covering each of these individual expeditions in more detail but this is the best one for combining all of them in a focused well-presented manner which will allow the novice Arctic reader a chance to glimpse all of these men in all their derring-do and will also allow the more experienced Arctic aficionado the chance to follow the myriad of themes throughout the many, often very sad, trips to the top of the world.  All of major characters are here.  Particularly well presented is the controversies surrounding Cook and the quite awful Peary.  A highly entertaing and enriching book.	2004-01-02

Before the mystery is complete, a couple of more people will die in one of Agatha Christie's most interesting early novels.  In addition to the larger than usual body count, the number of red herrings is tremondous, bordering at times on outrageous.  The solution, though, is perfectly Christie.  I had a good suspicion of who was responsible but never did figure out the how, although it all comes together so smoothly you will wonder why you missed the obvious.  Poirot is in fine form.  There is also a joy in reading of the lords and ladies mixing with actors and actresses (two sets which are favourites of Christie and with which she writes so engagingly).  A fine mystery.	2003-12-22

The title of the book is &quot;Negro President&quot;, Jefferson and the Slave Power, but that can be somewhat misleading. The historical personage who sits front and centre in this discussion of the slave power is New England's own Timothy Pickering.  The author provides a different take on this often maligned character.  It is shown how Pickering doggedly fought againt the 3/5 federal ratio that allowed the Southern slave states to count their slaves (partially) in order to increase their place in the houses and, in the case of Jefferson, help elect a President of the United States.  Jefferson's role in this extension of slave power is examined.  Particularly enlightening is a new look at the selection of Washington as the site of the new capital.  When focused must directly on these aspects, the book is strongest.  The text does, on occasion, wander a little farther afield though.  The sections on John Quincy Adams feel undeveloped in an appendix sort of fashion, although interesting in their own right.  It is nice to see a reexamination of Pickering, particularly as a way to view Jefferson in a fresher light.	2003-12-18

There are a number of threads in this tight weave, though, and the reader will enjoy the build-up and the mystery as it unfolds.  Tim Underhill is a wonderful character and his family makes sense in this book.  The creeping horror quotient is high (and with a serial killer and a haunted house how could it be otherwise) and will carry the reader breathlessly through until the end when a little feeling of letdown may mar the experience.  The author is still one of the masters and this is, for the most part, a fine example of his work.	2003-12-12

It is too bad that story crafted around his polemics could not have been more intriguing, the characters stronger, or the writing better.  Too often, characters give long speeches about &quot;symbology&quot; (by which I think they mean symbolism), frequently while being chased on foot.  I can barely sputter two words while on the tread mill but it is nice to know that a cryptanalyst and a university professor are so much more fit than I.  The author does keep The Da Vinci Code's action moving quickly though and has fashioned a very satisfying ending that wraps up all the loose ends in a moving manner.  The book is not all it could be but it could be so much worse.	2003-12-05

Scotti to have selected as it would be hard not to have a successful tale to tell with a story of such inherent drama.  The author does an admirable job in Sudden Sea of letting the story tell itself without getting too much in the way.  The few small lapses (the thinly set context for this time and place is perhaps one misstep) are quickly erased as the hurricane barrels its way up the coast.  The author wisely selects her scenes and the reader is captured by the tension of the life-and-death struggles of the survivors judiciously highlighted.  This book is a little in the shadows next to a classic like Isaac's Storm but it still provides a great, late night of nail-biting (and very often quite moving) reading.	2003-12-02

This book consists of three more longish stories that outshine most of those in Agatha Christie's other short story collections.  These stories are all typically English of their period and show off their great detective creation, Hercule Poirot, in a less pompous form than the novels often portray him.  The author has taken the time in these short pieces to assemble a large cast and a great variety of clues to hold any reader's interest.  Almost as good as her full novels and that is saying a lot.	2003-11-28

Along the way, he covers music, art, religion, philosophy, history, and biography, as well as, of course, literature, and merges them together in quite insightful ways.  The book is strongest in the early Anglo-Saxon and medieval sections that set up the author's thesis and it can grow a tad bit repetitious in theme in the later chapters as he pounds home his ideas.  Overall though, the reader should be fascinated by the vast number of examples from primary (and some interesting secondary) sources that pepper the book.  The author's knowledge is vast and his selection of sources is unimpeccable.  A frequently interesting read.	2003-11-28

It tells the truth about bias (and BIAS, Goldberg's rather weird book) and the news, and shows quite clearly that the media should properly be termed, as per the Eric Alterman, SCLM, the so-called liberal media.  This book covers much of the same territory as recent liberal authors have trod over, although this particular one covered it a little earlier and focuses more exclusively on the media and its overgrowth of conservative punditocracy and the mainstream media they have cowed into submission.  Eric Alterman presents his arguments forcefully and smoothly.  This is a strong book needed to battle a very absurd myth.	2003-11-12

It smoothly satirizes the type of novels that Oprah was once famous for selecting for her book club. Not bad books in themselves but of a type.  The author of this book plays with that type in this story of twin sisters, one earthy ... and one cerebral ... and an abusive man who enters their lives.  There will be abuse and there will be revenge but mostly there is humour, particularly in the voice of the narrator, the purer sister.  It is a delightful read.	2003-11-07

Cicero was an impressive figure living in an interesting time and it is important and necessary to have a biography such as this one come out to allow readers not steeped in classical studies, particularly Cicero's own writings, a chance to escape to this distant time which often has a resonance in our own difficult period.  The author does a good job of hitting all the hot spots and smoothing out some of the political complexities for the general reader while still providing a feel for ancient Rome as Republicanism writhed toward its end.	2003-11-06

Between this book and the very good Under the Banner of Heaven by Jon Krakauer, the horrific events of September 11, 1857 will become better known.  Sally Denton, in American Massacre (The Tragedy at Mountain Meadows, September 1857) tells a fast-paced story from as many viewpoints as she can.  Importantly, she provides a thorough context in which to place the events.  Most of the details are covered, albeit in a briefer manner, in Krakauer's book but in much larger context.  Denton's book could have benefited from an examination of the effects of the massacre beyond the decade of its occurrence in order to show the ways in which the details have been covered up and obscured since that time by the Mormon Church and its state of Utah.  An important look at a defining moment in American history.	2003-10-30

The author explores Tammany Hall, the Progressive Movement, immigration to America, the lives of the poor and the rich, and many other topics to let the reader fully understand the impact this fire had on the political and social life of the city and, eventually, the country.  The story is peopled with socialites, like the daughter of J. P. Morgan, future leaders of politics, such as Alfred E. Smith, Robert Wagner and, especially, Frances Perkins, and labour leaders, but the narrative comes most fully alive with the stories of the women and men who worked at the Factory itself.  The centrepiece of this tale is their struggle on the day of the fire and the author does this episode proud.  It is a harrowing tale told brilliantly.  A highly recommended book.	2003-10-23

The author, Paul Fussell, concentrates on the actual experiences of the soldiers themselves over the entire campaign.  This is a departure for the always superb Modern Library Chronicles series, which generally focuses on large, sweeping periods of history or topics.  This small volume is concerned solely with such things as intimate as the personal fears of individual soldiers during a particular battle.  This book is not a chronicle of the battles, which are covered exhaustively elsewhere (a wonderful bibliography will guide the reader) but it strictly covers the drafted soldiers who fought those battles.  This book is the perfect antidote for anyone who believes that war, any war, is glorious.  There may be good reasons for fighting (and the chapter on the uncovering of the German work camps provides one) but the fighting itself is never noble, never heroic, and never truly over for those on the front lines.  This book should be a companion piece for any other on the Second World War as it lets the soldiers speak in a voice not often heard.  A perfect addition to the a great series.	2003-10-16

It is very funny, particularly as it pokes gaping holes into that demonic pair of Fox pundits, Hannity and O'Reilly, and the rather crazy, and crazed, Coulter.  They may be rather easy targets when it comes to spotting liers but as long as people continue to believe them Al Franken must continue to deflate them.  <br />The author only stumbles a little along the way.  The book could have used a little tighter editing, though, as when it came to a long comedic story about prominent Republican draft-dodgers that could have been excised, and a few of the chapters near the end that could have been expanded.  This makes a fine companion to the slightly superior Bushwhacked by Molly Ivins.  Franken's book is recommended for anyone who truly cares about the future of America.	2003-10-09

It is a well told tale concentrating on the battle itself as told from the leaders and planners and, in the case of Israel, the soldiers who actually fought the battle.  The more personal, intimate touches help hold the reader's interest and the author keeps the whole story moving at a brisk pace.  It is an intense read, particularly the sections covering the failures of Israeli intelligence.  The action is focused on the war itself, with little outside political context given.  Neither the role of Russia or the United States is touched on in any extensive way, and Syria, due to lack of sources, is silent.  But what the book does do, it does well.  An exciting read.	2003-09-30

Bush's America	Books	5	83	95	N	N	The Best Thing to Come Out of Texas	Molly Ivins and Lou Dobuse brilliantly follow up their previous effort, Shrub, with the even more potent Bushwhacked, looking at the life in America as Dubya has reshaped since leaving the state of Texas.  Essentially he has applied every pro-corporation idea that has failed in Texas and has taken it nationwide.  The book is particularly effective in showing the small and dangerous ways things have changed, in addition to all the big ones we are all sadly aware of (Iraq and Enron).  The authors look at the small bureacrats and the lesser laws not covered by a sleeping media and traces their impact on real Americans.  This book contains the wonderful lines we have learned to expect from Molly Ivins but it will just as often bring the reader to tears.  It is touching and terrifying.  I hope this book will serve to wake us all up to the horrors being put forward to the sole benefit of the corporations that have paid for them.  The authors end on a somewhat hopeful note, suggesting ways to change the system.  This is a book that is, unfortunately, very needed in these troubled times.  Highly recommended.	2003-09-26

The book, though, is still a fascinating stroll through the past hundred years of Harvard history.  It starts a little slowly with the author setting up two archetypes but gathers steam as the twentienth century takes flight.  The author does wander around the topic at times as the personality presented connections to Harvard are stretched or evidence of his homosexuality is tenuously produced but he keeps the narrative flowing in and among the varied characters populating this history.  A rewarding read for the anyone who sticks with it.	2003-09-19

The Promised Land, for that reason, holds a high degree of historical interest for anyone with a fascination for this period and the process of an immigrant's journey from their mother country to their new home.  I wish I could recommend it more highly but it is written in such drippingly purple tones that at times it comes close to being cringe worthy.  The author did possess a high degree of self awareness but an often low degree of awareness of others that makes her endlessly new revelations about herself seem more and more self-centred.  This book is of its time with its concern for the early progessive movements' ideas about cleanliness and the prose stylings from the end of the nineteenth century.  It can a little hard going but is worth the effort for a look at one woman's journey to an America that once followed the words written on the Statue of Liberty.	2003-09-12

The job is divded into the Seven Ages of Paris to create more bite-size morsels for the reader but it is the character of the city and the characters within the city which make spanning the centuries so much fun. The author includes most of the bloody bits of the history (and with Paris, there was much of that) but also pauses to brings in elements of the arts and culture, particularly in the wonderful sections detailing the past hundred and fifty years.  The architecture of the city is told in great detail and may be of interest to some readers, primarily those who have seen Paris.  This book was a joy.  The author touched on all the important periods and, though a favourite personality may be missing here or there, makes it an interesting read for everyone.	2003-09-10

The author explains all of the science involved in a very understandable and readable way so that all readers can follow this fascinating story.  The narrative concerns the migration of man out of Africa and then all around the globe.  Language and archeology play a part but this book focuses on the genetic clues to piece together this history which everyone alive today shares.  Along the way, he debunks theories of race and any idea of biology as destiny.  The author shows that we, modern humans, are all genetically related wherever we have recently hailed from.  He does not shy away from the various controversies that swirl around these ideas but tackles them with great skill, particularly in the chapters focusing on the Americas.  This is a very informative and entertaining book.	2003-09-08

The cast of characters could have been a little more diverse but it is one of the first Hercule Poirot mysteries to fully exploit the generation gap between Poirot (and Hastings) and the young things at the centre of this book in an amusing manner.  For Agatha Christie fans used to her methods, the solution will be fairly obvious rather quickly but it is still a clever little puzzle and should delight and mystify any readers not completely immersed in the author's vast output of books.  A wonderfully diverting and fun mystery.	2003-08-27

It is the sheer imagination that goes into creating the delicate images and characters that populate this lovely book that will delight the reader.  The novel would require more substance to be among Bradbury's fantasy classics, such as Something Wicked This Way Comes, but, taken on its own, this book will still thrill the reader interested in wandering through a gentle fantasy filled with ghosts, men with wings, mummies and a girl whose mind journeys through many miles and even more hosts.

It marks a return to the kind of mysteries Christie wrote best and away from the earlier spy thriller, The Big Four.  This novel is full to bursting with interesting characters from secretaries to jewel thieves to countesses to companions for crusty old ladies, and all drawn with effortless skill by the author in a few simple strokes.  There may even be a few too many characters for some reader's tastes as a few of them are quite obviously not actively involved in the plot but it is fun to watch the author parade the cast of characters all about the villas of the Riviera and the streets of Paris.  A very nice Christie whodunit.	2003-08-22

The last three short stores, while very good, do not reach the same level as those first ones but it is a relief to step back a little from the power and the pain.  Mental illness, grief and loss form a common thread throughout the book.  The title of the volume comes from the words of one of the characters but the words of another could just as easily have substituted, &quot;We will survive this&quot;.  Somehow the characters do survive, just barely and with their pain a throbbing wound, but they do survive and the author brings us gently and persuasively to this understanding that people can and do survive just about anything.  The stories should make you cry a little, feel a little empty for a moment, and then give you your breath back as you contemplate their jagged beauty.  A gem of a book.	2003-08-20

And moving Hercule Poirot away from country houses was not a good idea as he traipses uncharateristically all over the continent.  His famous gray cells seem a little slow as well as all the puzzles set before him will be readily apparent to the reader long before the famous detective figures it out. The saving grave of this otherwise dismal entry into the Poirot library is the return of Hastings and the development of the relationship between Poirot and himself.  A mystery to be skipped except for the die hard Christie fans.	2003-08-19

Reading this book, it often very hard to believe the credulity of those engaged in this fruitless goal.  These intrepid explorers would venture into unknown territory  on the basis of poor (often fictitious) accounts of previous ventures and the notions of stay-at-home geographers filling spaces on the map with their own personal dreams and fantasies.  Though they never found the Northwest Passage, they did leave behind a rich treasure trove of tales and adventures which the author weaves together very skilfully.  The arctic explorations of the sixteenth and (particularly) the nineteenth centuries have been fully chronicled lately.  It is nice to have a historian fully and richly represent the 1700s.  A nice read.	2003-08-18

Agatha Christie Classic	The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is one of Agatha Christie's most talked about mysteries with a shocking ending (matched in a sort of frustrating cleverness only by Murder on the Orient Express).  I first read this book as a teenager and remember distinctly being angry at the denoument but, on a sober second reading, have grown to appreciate its cleverness.  Some readers may feel tricked but that is the glorious point of the book.  It wakes up the readers of mystery novels from looking at things in the same way and to remember to keep open to all possibilities.  What is especially nice is the way in which the novel still holds up on a second reading.  Recommended for the fan of English country house mysteries.	2003-08-18

The middle section on the growth of nationalism is, by far, the most potent element in the book.  The author makes effective use of his sources in making this period come alive.  He is not quite as effective in connecting this directly with the battle of Verdun itself as an unique outgrowth of this nationalism but he does capture the truth of the battle in very graphic terms. His arguments demonstrating the folly of nationalism are always interesting, though.  The use of letters from the front, diaries, and memoirs in building his case allows the reader to see the personal side of this clash.  An often fascinating read.	2003-08-14

The short story form does not suit the mystery as practiced by Christie as there are always too few suspects and too few clues (or red herrings) and it becomes easier and easier to guess the solution.  The author relies too heavily on similar devices, particularly the use of disguises (taken to an unbelievable level in &quot;The Kidnapped Prime Minister&quot; but stretching at the levels of credibility even before then).  The stories can still be delightful for Poirot fans and there is even a story in which the great detective gets it wrong.  Perhaps on a muggy, steamy day (like today for me) these stories can be fun when one wants to read a mystery but realizes the air is too heavy to concentrate for more than a dozen or so pages at a time.  Recommended for those already enamored of the Belgian and his little gray cells.  Not so much for readers new to Christie.	2003-08-13

Instead of the usual adventure/outdoors tale, though, this time he tackles violent and passion faith, particularly that of Mormon Fundamentalism.  The story veers between true crime (the killing of a mother and daughter by two brothers) and the history and development of a particular and relatively recent religion.  The author includes many strands in this net and handles it all smoothly, intelligently and at an exciting pace.  It is a gripping book that should shake the reader from complacency.  The recent interviews included in the book are often touching or shocking.  This book will be controversial but that is simply indicative of its strength.  A harrowing, powerful, highly recommended read.	2003-07-30

Other chapters concern the Doll Family of midgets, the movies of Melies, the automatons of Vaucanson and the deception of the chess playing Turk (not an actual automaton).  These pieces do not always blend together smoothly but the author works very hard to connect all the dots.  On their own, though, each chapter is fascinating and filled with memorable anecdotes and will have the reader looking at the world in a different way.  An enjoyable read.	2003-07-28

Its author, Iain McCalman has done a commendable job of detailing all the important events in the life of this interesting product of this time.  The age of enlightenment produced a bursting forth of superstitions and charlatans and the Count Cagliostro will always stand as the supreme example, achieving an immortality that would have thrilled him.  His story nicely touches the lives of many other important figures of his time, such as Catherine the Great, Casanova, and many figures of pre-Revolutionary France through his invovlement in the Affair of the Diamond Necklace.  The story is told well and swiftly and makes for a great read.  It could have been a little longer, though, with added context, such as more information on the political situation in Russia and France or further details on Freemasonry or Rosicrucianism for example, to help the reader understand more fully the world the Count was traveling through and, often, manipulating.  Still, a very interesting biography.	2003-07-16

The cast of charaters is small and there are some wonderfully complex twists but the main pleasure to be derived from this book is setting up Poirot in counterpoint to a more &quot;modern&quot; detective who uses less of a psychological approach and more of the blood-hound method examing the minutiae of the scene and following the scent.  Hercule Poirot would definately not be a avid &quot;CSI&quot; watcher.  The story also contains many romantic elements, another popular genre used by the author, that generally work better here than in other of her books.  A good mystery, if not a Christie classic.	2003-07-11

I was not disappointed by her latest effort, Beyond Belief (The Secret Gospel of Thomas).  It is a little more personal at times than her previous writings which actually enhances the experience considerably.  One does not have to be a believer to enjoy the author's take on the early battles in Christianity as orthodoxy was determined and the gospel of Thomas, and its believers, were defined as heretical, much to the future church's harm.  The gospel of John was the winner and the author provides a rich, learned examination of Irenaeus and his pivotal role in the early battles.  It is a brief book that is highly focused.  A longer book with a wider context may have been helpful to the general reader but this is still a recommended read for anyone with an interest in religious history.	2003-07-10

Rowling's hungrily awaited Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has arrived and fans will get their full fill of everything they love about this series.  Everyone's favourite characters from all the past four books will make appearances, often in surprising ways, and some familiar ones, such as Ginny and Neville, will be deepened and enriched.  Many questions are answered and some others are introduced.  There are suprises, fights, sullen teenagers and, even, a touch of awkward romance.  This book is both darker and bigger than the previous volumes.  It is not better than the others but it is not worse and it will live up to expectations.	2003-06-27

I gulp down mystery novels whole and I devour unreservedly every scrap of British royal history so what could be more appropriate than this classic.  Perhaps I have read too many actual works of history, albeit of the wonderful pop variety kind of Alison Weir, that have refuted Tey's conclusions.  I was delighted from the moment I began the book.  It was more clever and far more humourous than I had anticipated and I could not recommend it more highly (although I still have doubts about the verdict reached). I have no doubts, though, about the journey.  It was pure, unfettered joy.	2003-06-21

How does one follow up that brilliant psychological drama?  Shutter Island is the answer and it will probably disappoint fans of Mystic River as it seems a throw-back to an earlier form of crime novel, more stylized than naturalistic.  This new novel takes place on one very dark and stormy night and the cliches do not stop piling up after that.  The author even seems to love this chance to indulge in as many as he can squeeze through the pages.  There is a wonderfully clammy paranoic feel to the book, making its setting in the early fifties feel appopriate.  The mystery becomes a little obvious and somewhat forced so it is best if the reader just hangs on and enjoys the ride without thinking too much.  A decent follow-up, much heavier on creeping suspense than intelligent insight and charaterization than his previous books, but still worth the trip.	2003-06-19

All of her trademarks are right here from the beginning in the character of Poirot and his brilliant gray matter and the delightful Hastings (before he become completely stuffy, as in the later books).  There are red herrings aplenty and everyone seems to be up to something suspicious, much like one would want from an English country house.  I have taken a summer vow to re-read all of the Poirot books that I read over the past four decades but this time to read them in the order they were written.  The sole advantage of memory loss may be the ability to read these books again without a clue as to who did it.  Maybe growing older will not be so bad.  This book makes a perfect start to the series and to my summer.  A bon-bon of Belgian chocolate.	2003-06-14

He is, though, a magnificent fictional creation by author/artist Chris Ware.  This story of generations of Corrigan men is a sad tale as it meanders between the past and present, with only meager hope for the future.  It is a quietly transfixing and brilliantly produced tale but it can also be very, very depressing, at time overpowerly so.  Even Jimmy Corrigan's fantasies are often quite sad.  It can also be gently humourous and breathtaking (particularly the drawings of the Chicago World's Exposition and the White City).  A highly recommended piece of literature.	2003-06-13

The good news that his sister's comedy, Strangers with Candy, is coming out on DVD made me pick this book up again and remember all over what a truly Talented Family this is (and Amy's appearances in David's essays are amongst the funniest sections, outside of the David learning French, of course).  These essays seem fresh on second and third helpings.  Since the first time I read this I have finally heard many of them on NPR and now can read them with the author's rather distinctive voice in my head.  Now my brain is, sadly, changing all commerical jingles into rather nasally, high-pitched Billie Holliday-emoting songs.  That may not be a blessing but this book is and will always be.	2003-06-11

One More Kiss, the Broadway musical in the 1970s, is the most personal of all the volumes.  In many ways, this is one of its strong features as the author has personally seen all of the shows and can give an impression of it beyond what the critics have left.  This strength, though, can often be the book's weakness as the author's personal feelings spill over all the pages.  His political conservatism often shadows his opinions in ways that tell one more about the author than about the shows he is discussing.  Still, it is an interesting book, sometimes fascinating and informative, sometimes shrill and bitchy, but always well-informed and particularly strong in its analysis of the major hits (Chorus Line, Chicago, Annie, etc.) and the Sondheim shows.  A fascinating, frustrating addition to this series.	2003-06-09

Humanity's chances on earth have a 50/50 probablility, in the author's opinion, of making it into the end of the century.  The book is too short, though, to truly give the reader an understanding of the several ways briefly described that may end life as we know it.  It is a blur of despair with elements of hope scattered throughout.  The author should have trusted the intelligence of the reader a little more and actually been more descriptive in his science.  The reader will come away with a numb feeling but no true understanding.  This book is still important for what is does provide and is briefly illuminating in its descriptions of science gone too far, as well as the many other varied possible ending prophesied.  An important book that will hopefully lead to more thorough accounts.  Not for the light of heart.	2003-06-02

It is still a surprise, though, that he is also just as good at leading a science novice through a history of science that ranges swiftly from astronomy to physics to chemistry to geology to biology with incredible leaps and not a few bounds.  A Short History of Nearly Everything is almost everything the title proposes (it can be argued that at almost five hundred pages it may not qualify as short).  That the author makes the book entertaining, sometimes gripping and sometime funny, is understandable given his skill as a writer demonstrated previously, but that he can make the science relatively understandable to me is a beautiful revelation. No one wields an anecdote with such skill as the author. One of the better all-round science books for the general audience that I have encountered that will lead me to more specific topics of interest.  This book was a great pleasure.	2003-05-28

It is, in essence, a comparative essay showing how the idea of one America became the concept, through time, of two Americas.  He does not use any trite triumphalist thinking in writing about America and one of the most fascinating aspects of the book is the author's demonstration that the similarities between the two continents, as opposed to their usually endlessly discussed differences, are numerous and essential in understanding their histories.  This book is a refreshing look at the &quot;New World&quot; in a more global perspective.  His examples, particularly from South America, are refreshing and insightful.  The writing is a pure pleasure.  A wonderful new book from a great series.	2003-05-18

Lee (Penguin Lives)	Books	4	14	18	N	N	Blount Does Well with the Material	Roy Blount, Jr. is an interesting choice to write the short biography of Robert E. Lee for the Penguin Lives series.  Historians have had their chance and now it is Blount's and he makes good use of many of their interpretations, in addition to his selective, yet effective, use of primary sources.  All the facts are in evidence and the details feel right.  The narrative is straight forward and moves at a brisk pace appropriate to the small format of this impressive series of biographies.  The usual witty style of the author breaks through on occasion and he lets his best self come out in the appendices, including one on the humour of Lee and Lee's attitude to slavery.  A biography of Lee still suffers a little as Lee never seems to come across as colourfully as most of the Civil War leaders but the author does his best to provide his own colour commentary.  A quick, interesting read.	2003-05-15

That should not be a surprise but, as the book is almost six hundred pages long, it is a bit suprising.  I was expecting much more tangential information to fill out the story but the author has kept the focus sharp and drives the narrative forward in a clean straight line.  This is everything one will ever need to know about the murder of Lord Darnley and in that respect the book is entertaining, informative and will be a wonderful addition for all Alison Weir fans.  The only caveat is that the book could have used a little more editing in spots, particularly where the author drives home her points repeatedly.  This is not the best Tudor-period history book that Alison Weir has written , of which there are many and all are recommended highly, but is still much better than most out there.	2003-05-13

The book grabs the reader from the start and never quite lets go.  The author lets one know, to some extent, the ending (and, for all intents and purposes, I am ignoring the off-putting eqilogue which feels tacked on and just simply wrong) so it is not entirely suspense that carries the reader along.  Instead it is the wonderful world view the author creates.  As many have suggested, it is an anti-Lord of the Flies in that this forced separation from society at large brings out the best, in often surprising ways, of both the hostages and terrorists.  This sunny side of life tale-telling can get a little too romantic for my taste at times but the wonderful writing helps ease the way along and prevents it from becoming heavy or burdensome and creates a very powerful, hopeful view of the world.  A very pleasant novel to escape into for a while.	2003-04-29

This book should be given to anyone celebrating a birthday who could use a snack from a Hippo-Heimers back (and, quite frankly, who could not).  It is a book for all ages through the ages, entirely timeless in its zany approach to that special day.  It will have you shouting \\"I am I\\" which is the purpose of birthdays and even better is having someone with whom to share one's birthday to shout \\"We are we\\".

Someone had lent me a copy and it was the only book in my backpack on the commute to work one morning as I had forgotten to bring the book I was reading, so I started it and had one of the best journeys of my life.  I immediately ran out and bought my own copy as I knew that I would read this book over and over again.  It is very funny and, in the end, quite touching in ways that all readers will understand and appreciate.  The best endorsement of this book is that it will get one to investigate all sorts of old classics and look at reading and writing in new and different ways.  I personally will be letting used books fall open just to see what interested a reader from the past and what he or she is trying to tell me.  I little trick gratefully picked up from the delightful Helene Hanff.	2003-04-22

The astonishing fact about this book is that the most interesting aspect is the first couple hundred pages of history on both the colonization of the East Indies and the development of the study of the earth.  That he can render the history of geology so fascinating should be no suprise to readers of his last book, The Map That Changed the World, but that he can almost suceed in rendering it more gripping than the account of the explosion itself is a wonder.  Which is not to say the explosion of Krakatoa is not incredibly nail-biting because it most certainly is.  The story flags a little in the politics of the last chapters recounting the aftermath of the explosion, but only a little, as the author seems on less sure ground.  An exciting read.	2003-04-19

Bush	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Appropriately Non-Issue Portrait of a Campaign	Frank Bruni's Ambling into History (The Unlikely Odyssey of George W. Bush) is a fun read.  It is shallow in its portrayal of the the campaign to make George Bush president as well the boys on the bus who followed him around.  But, in this case, it is an appropriate approach as the author makes it clear the reporters cared as little about the issues as the candidate himself did.  This book, instead, focuses on the look and manner of the man and in that respect presents many telling, often humourous details.  This examination makes a good companian piece to Alexandra Pelosi's documentary while providing an even broader perspective, giving glimpses into the personalities of Laura and the elder Bushes and continuing the coverage into the (often too fawning) first year of the presidency.  It is more a glimpse of reporters covering the man than the actual man himself.  But in that narrow framework, the book is entertaining enough.	2003-04-16

After all, it has secret service agents, a world wide computer program simulating war, and a whole host of potential assassins.  Those readers looking for a novel of suspense, or even any of form of a narrative driven approach to the novel, will be dismayed but, if they stick with it, they will be very richly rewarded and often delighted and moved.  The author gives the reader a rich tapestry of minor and major characters and moments in their life.  I marvelled that there was not a single character that did not interest me.  There are no conclusions in any pat sense in the lives of these peopel only snapshots of a weekend.  This book is a marvelous creation that should be enjoyed for these fascinating and pertinent characters.  It is a wonderfully written moment in our time.	2003-04-12

It is essentially a series of interconnected essays that assails the myth making that goes into nations sending people off to murder other people.  The examples are primarily, but not exclusively, drawn from his own experiences covering wars around the world.  The author has earned the right to write this book and we should be glad that he has written it.  As long as the noble myths of warfare exist, warfare will always be a driving force and prime motivator of people, instead of an absolute last resort.  Anyone who believes the lies told about war, predominantly by the media as discussed in this book, should stop for a minute and read this book before continuing their incessant war chanting.  A powerful and moving book.	2003-04-08

For the best history on the Jack the Ripper case, the reader is strongly advised to read Philip Sugden's The Complete History of Jack the Ripper.  Begg's book would then make an interesting follow-up for the beginning Ripperologist and a must-have for the more devoted follower of Saucy Jack.  The author provides a great deal of context (perhaps a tad too much, did the story truly need to begin in Roman times?) which other Ripper books never provide and gives important political thumb nail sketches of the political personalities and issues at the time which directly and indirectly affected the investigations.  It would have been nice if the information on the victims and suspects had been expanded a little as one could always feel the author wanting to let loose with his opinion and other facts, particularly noticeable in the chapter on Mary Kelly.  An interesting enough addition to the Ripper lore.	2003-04-06

This book is richly rewarding as it connects the many lives of this very private public figure.  Blunt is a complex personality and it took thorough research and the skill of a good writer to fully appreciate and capture these many and varied layers.  The examination into the world of academia and art history was particularly well done and held the interest of this reader.  I picked up this book because of the spying details but, to my surprise, found myself as riveted by all the other aspects of this man's live.  This book, unlike all the others written about the Cambridge spies, does not come with an axe to grind and it is all the stronger for that abscence.  Highly recommended.	2003-04-04

I approached this particular edition was some trepidation as the subject matter seemed a little dry (there is, after all, a chapter called \\"The Triumph of Managerial Capitalism\\".)  The book is more interesting than expected and is written with some humour as well as a certain amount of patience for the less business informed reader.  The strong caveat, though, is that the authors do stress the triumph of the company in creating everything that is good in the world, making their case less often then I suspect they wanted to.  They are honest about the bad, such as the Belgian Congo and Enron, but try to make clear that positives exist with enormous negatives.  Trying to find a positive in the holocaust of the Congo is not, in fact, possible but the authors cheerfully give it a shot.  Despite their obvious boosterism, this is an interesting book and a worthwhile introduction to one side of an argument.	2003-03-27

This is by no means a true biography but it does fill a certain need until that volume is written.  It gives almost everybody Jerome Robbins met in his life a chance to speak, sometimes briefly and sometimes at length, about working with or knowing him.  No aspect of his life is left untouched.  This book is almost less about Jerome Robbins as a person than it is about the ways in which he touched people.  All the nastiness is there but also all the good things people had to say about him.  There is nothing defintive about this book but it makes for a fascinating read and is a testament to power of this difficult genius.	2003-03-26

Lovell made a wise decision when she took up her pen and joined the Mitford industry.  The Sisters (The Saga of the Mitford Family) is a truly fascinating and endlessly engaging book.  And there was no way it could not be with those crazy Mitfords: Nancy, Jessica, Debo, Diana, Pam and, of course, the very tragic Unity Valkyrie, conceived at Swastika Canada and devoted friend of Hitler.  The story of these sisters spans the twentienth century and travels all over the political spectrum.  The author shows her own conservative bias clearly throughout and was obviousaly charmed by Diana Mosely (nee Mitford), the still living wife of Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Fascists during the interwar years.  But her prejudices and political naivete (the author's suggestion that World War II could possibly have been avoided if Diana just brought Hitler and Churchill, a relative of hers, together is quite silly and should have been edited out) are so apparent that one can enjoy the book regardless.  The portrayal of the mother of the girls, Sydney, is the most interesting to come along of her.  A wonderful, delightful read of six powerfully individual women.	2003-03-22

Thes stories span the world and are told from a multiplicity of viewpoints ranging in age, sex and ethnicity while always feeling true and honest in their varied characterizations. \\"The Hunter's Wife\\" is the best example of the way most of these stories connect people with nature and through nature with each other in a circle that while often causing pain is also a means of healing.  The charm of these stories is how they are seemingly simple but are actually rich and emotionally complex.  \\"For a Long Time This Was Griselda's Story\\" does not intertwine the characters with nature as do the others but it is my favourite.  It reverberates with a quietly building strength.  A fantastic collection of stories.	2003-03-18

Secret Agents is a gripping, well-written fast read that should deeply frighten everyone on first glance.  The subtitle is the menace of emerging infections but it could almost be changed to the menace of everything.  There seems little escape from the possible scenarios she clearly presents (and this clarity is definately one of the book's strengths as she makes bio-science quite understandable for the layperson.)  The chapter on the West Nile Virus that begins the book is particularly exciting and will the hook the reader immediately.  If one pauses to look at the actual numbers, the book is somewhat less frightening as the numbers of deaths are always substantially below many of the doom-sayers' predictions, although she will repeatedly tell the reader this may not always be so.  A fascinating book for our times.	2003-03-12

He had to find a follow-up to the successful, fascinating and entertaining Isaac's Storm.  He selected the same decade of history but an entirely different story in The Devil in the White City.  This is truly a worthy successor to the previous volume.  This time the story is shared by two main protaganists, the architect Daniel Burnham and the serial killer, Dr. H. H. Holmes, although the main character is the White City itself, the Chicago World's Fair.  The author paints his portraits breathlessly and moves the reader quickly along leaving no odd or interesting fact unstated as he weaves the narratives together.  This pop history is without a doubt entertaining, while not being overly enlightening.  Sometimes the writing follows set repeated patterns, such as the constant reference to several personalities startingly blue eyes that, after a while, may make the reader feel those eyes must actually even have glowed in the dark.  Overall though, it is a fascinating read that will keep the reader up into the dark themselves.  The author met his own challenge set up by Isaac's Storm.	2003-03-08

The character of Xenia, a woman both from, but not of, the Black Sea area is the personality that the story revolves around.  She is like Ovid's writing come to life and she inspires him to greater heights.  The author makes this ancient world come alive and is successful in fashioning breathing personalities for both Ovid and Xenia.  The story, though, at times feels like a novella and the fascinating character of Julia, the emperor's grand-daughter (who will share a fate with Ovid) sometimes seems lost behind the two major characters when she should have been given a little more space.  That aside, this is a pleasant, sweetly-voiced novel about a man who will live forever.	2003-02-28

I have finally finished the Lord of the Rings.  Savouring the last page of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Return of the King is a bittersweet moment.  It is hard to say good-bye to these wonderful characters.  The first half of this book was dazzling in its darkness and the entire book was only marred a little by the anticlimatic last hundred pages (excepting the delightful last two chapters set in the Shire, still amounting to four chapters of good-bying.)  But that is being too nit-picky for a trilogy that gives such intense pleasure and created such vibrant figures of fantasy.  Gandalf and Frodo, particularly, will always live on as they deserve to do.	2003-02-27

Ian Buruma's Inventing Japan (1853 - 1964) is a valuable edition to this marvelous series.  The author uses the short format effectively and efficiently as he demonstrates Japan's growing and changing sense of self since violently being pulled out of isolation in the middle of the nineteenth century.  He even provides a brief look at the history of Japan before this moment to show that it was not as isolated or as ignorant of the West as the myths would have one believe.  This book is wonderful at dispelling any illusions of the Japanese as a monolithic people but, instead, shows the  many intellectual, cultural and political threads being woven throughout its history, often at the same time.  It was a fascinating read that was over much too soon.	2003-02-20

This short volume is the equivalent of a prose poem in tribute to an unique town.  It has only two streets but what an amazing amount of humanity is crammed in there during the summer to be followed by the desolate quiet of winter.  This book is perfect to curl up with on this snowy, cold New York day while one dreams back to one's own times in Provincetown in those warmer summer days of past and future.  This town is perfect for a volume this size and, much like a weekend spent in Provincetown, I was sad to see it end but knew that I had not missed a thing in a such a small, yet perfect, town.  Some may bemoan both the inclusiveness of this book (and Provincetown itself) but then this is not the town for them.  A well-written, charming, highly recommended book.	2003-02-07

At first, one is expecting a big revelation that lives up to the sub-title, Jack the Ripper Case Closed, but it quickly becomes apparent that Portrait of a Killer has no revelations to impart or, what is even more strange, any no information not discussed in many previous books.  DNA evidence is hinted at but never delivered.  Despite this, Patricia Cornwell presents all of her vague posturing as proof positive never realizing that just because it is new to her does not, in fact, make it new or, even, proof.  To give the book its due, some of the forensic information concerning how the case would be handled today is interesting.  Sadly, though, the book is marred by very bad editing as many paragraphs seem entirely unrelated to their neighbours or even to the chapter it is in, and very bad historical research.  If a mystery writer were to tackle this time period perhaps Anne Perry would be a better choice as Victorian Britain is quite distorted by Cornwell's attempt at portraying it. I thought this book would be fun in the way some preposterous conspiracy theories can be a secret, silly delight to read.  This book never even achieved that level of shameful pleasure.  A frustrating, dissappointing book.	2003-02-06

William Adams is the title character, as per the subtitle of the Englishman who opened Japan, and he is a fascinating subject for a work of non-fiction.  Giles Milton, though, is also lucky to have a supporting cast of Dutch and Englishmen to add further adventure and villiany to the main story.  The major caveat of the book is that it is told entirely from the perspective of the Europeans.  This works to a certain extent in this book as the author is presenting how one culture (European) views another.  This will dissappoint those who wanted to learn more about Japan and the Japanese themselves during this period.  It is an exciting tale well told even if it does not match Giles Milton's finest piece of work, the highly recommended Big Chief Elizabeth.  Samurai William is a good read and a must for those who enjoyed Nathaniel's Nutmeg.	2003-01-31

The book becomes a little less focused on the issues of how to deal with this problem.  The first few chapters are both fascinating and horrifying as it looks at the ways both government, through both action and inaction, and corporations, through truly aggressive action, have helped to create a country where the amount of calories being consumed keeps rising.  The book is small and the coverage is slighter when it should be deeper on many of these initial inquiries.  The issue of class is relevant and important but gets a little muddled in the final chapters although it is good that it is raised at all.  This book is a wake-up call and will hopefully lead to stronger, sounder examinations of the problem.	2003-01-23

Hard Core: How the Struggle Over Censorship Created the Modern Film Industry	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Provocative Title, Thorough Study	Jon E. Lewis has written an interesting book in Hollywood v. Hard Core, although it does not entirely live up to or prove its subtitle, How the Struggle Over Censorship Created the Modern Film Industry, it often comes close.  The climax of the book focuses on the battles of the late sixties and early seventies but its vision is much larger and encompasses film history from its origins until the battles at the beginning of this new millenium.  He promises heroes and villains and he delivers them and even combines one person (Jack Valenti) in both roles, depending on who is talking about him, of course.  The book is always fascinating as it ranges over the history of film and the author always makes the economics clear and central to the debate (something left to the side in most histories of film censorship.)  Particularly interesting and illuminating is the section on the McCarthy period.  A recommended read.	2003-01-16

Frank Baum, Creator of Oz is a necessary books for fans of Oz.  Katharine M. Rogers provides a clear, balanced examination of the details of his life and includes analysis, and relates it to his life, of his writings, both Oz and other.  The most important aspect of this book are the sections describing his other (often) successful series for children, such as Aunt Jane's Niece, which are little known today.  The weakness of the book is the fact that outside of his writing, Baum's life is not particularly exciting.  It seems very pleasant and homey and I could not be happier for him, but it does not always make for thrilling reading.  Still, Baum fans will be delighted to have his entire story told so compentently with the added bonus of the author's informative analysis.	2003-01-09

It is not often these days that a subtitle for a work of history that claims so much (and they often do) is actually accurate.  Margaret Macmillan, in Paris 1919, backs up her subtitle completely in this brilliant work of history.  The book examines the Paris Peace Conference in all its glory and all its infamy.  Four, and sometime only three, men sat in a room and decided the future of the countries of the world and the fate of millions of people.  It is both that simple and, equally, that complicated.  This book brilliantly portrays these men but also, with just as much genius, many of the lesser officials who attended on behalf of either themselves or their (sometimes prospective) nations.  So many sources are used, from either official documents to private letters, from so many countries that the book feels all-encompassing which is appropriate considering its vast topic, even, god bless the author, the little colony of Newfoundland finds space for a mention.  This book will be the one to challenge in this new century concerning the peace conference as Keynes' was the one last century.  A very impressive work and highly recommended.	2003-01-06

It is in fact what it claims but it is also much more and a little less.  The little less is that only the book's last two chapters cover the period after the death of Aristotle but anyone who has slogged through medieval philosophy will appreciate and understand the author's choices.  The good news is how deftly the author, Anthony Gottlieb, covers the topics and philosophers selected.  The Dream of Reason is a wonderfully comprehensible volume that glorifies the Greeks, certainly not for getting it precisely right, but for expanding the attempts to actually get it (it, of course, being a simple word covering a multitude of complex ideas.)  This book is always intelligent and very entertaining.  There is no better single place for a reader to go to cover this vast period of time.	2002-12-26

The novel consists of very short, often hilarious, sections consisting of one woman's demented, off-kilter thoughts as she copes, or doesn't, with what flows around her.  As wonderful as these ideas and often vague notions are, the novel also subtley grows and packs an emotional wallop by the time the last page is turned.  The writing may be beautifully minimal but the impact is not.  It is one of the richer novels I have read lately and I never thought I would say that I was laughing my way through the first few pages.	2002-12-16

The ideas become circular and repetitive but the beautiful writing often smooths over these rough spots, while at other times there is true beauty, touched with both horror and sadness, in its words and thoughts.  Charles Bowden writes near the beginning that if he had life to live over again he \\"would never think that wars are events recorded in the book of history but realize they are actual and always take my hands from my ears and hear the cries of the slain.\\"  Much of this book is filled with those cries, and not only from war.  He also would never say no to a woman or skip a meal.  From evidence in this book, one gets the feeling he never has.  The section on food and his dying friends is the best part of the book and reverberates with a quiet power.  An unique book.	2002-12-14

This works effectively and all the elements are interesting and integral.  The book even picks up added narrative strength after the death of the Trujillo as the power vacuum is filled.  In a dictatorship of this sort (any sort, actually) no one is left unchanged as the poison seeps through all society. This book is best at making the political personal.  A frightening book, all the more so because of the great amount of historical truth among the fictional elements, yet always fascinating.	2002-12-11

The author takes fourteen objects and spins out a story of cultures clashing and times changing.  It is a fascinating series of narratives richly written with economy and style.  Ulrich is most effective in showing the Indian struggle in this settlers' Age of Homespun.  The author leaves no one out of the story and her selection of objects reflects this care as she cleverly creates a complete mosiac for this age.  The only struggle I had with the book was my own ignorance of spinning, weaving, carding, etc., therefore being confused by some of the terms and concepts.  An interesting book and a pleasure to read.	2002-12-07

The story is swiftly told and cleverly written and the atmosphere created at the novel's start is sustained throughout.  The climax somewhat lacked the cleverness of the majority of the novel but that is a small quibble (a word here that means a nit-picking reader looking for something to criticize to justify his review).  This book will lead this reader to explore the entire series to see if the style of writing or these characters' adventures continue to entertain time and again.  That will be the true test for this good beginning to an interesting series.	2002-12-04

Tolkien's The Two Towers continues the delightful adventures of the now-divided Fellowship.  The story moves at a faster clip than the first book with action bouncing through the story of Pippin, Merry, Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn and a terrific sense of suspense crawling and creeping through the story of Frodo and Sam.  The emotional resonances among the characters are also much deeper in this volume, particularly in such aspects as the relationship between Sam and Frodo.  The two main reasons, though, for this readers' joy are the Ents and Gollum.  The ents are the most dazzling creation by the author of Middle Earth and Treebeard should live as one of the most memorable fantasy figures of all time.  And as for Gollum, I was pleased to discover how much I liked his prescence.  I found him a little trying in The Hobbit but here he works so very well.  A rollicking adventure-horror-fantasy.	2002-11-28

Bosnia and Kosovo are the centerpieces but the book also touches meaningfully on Iraq, Somalia, Rwanda, and Haiti.  The thumbnail biographical portraits of all the leading American figures is a great joy and asset of this book.  Foreign policy can be a confusing issue, not least of all because of its lack of intelligible coverage in the media or on campaign trails.  Halberstam makes all these complex issues and myriad personalities shine through clearly.  His critiques of the media are particularly important and compelling and this book is a refreshing antidote to the sort of journalism television has thrust to the fore.  This is a valuable book but, most of all, it is a enjoyable and fascinating read.	2002-11-25

I had read the Hobbit and enjoyed it but never finally felt compelled to pick up J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring.  The characters of Frodo, Sam, Aragorn and Gandalf are more complex than I expected and I loved the slow build up as both dread and unbearable tension are increased with every step on their long journey.  The novel has a quicker pace after the Council of Elrond and the previously established atmosphere is put to good use and delivers on all its promises.  How I missed this book during my nerdy teenage years will always remain a mystery.  I am only thankful I have opened myself up to them now in my tender middle years.	2002-11-17

The Partly Cloudy Patriot did not disappoint in any way.  These short essays are very funny, often thoughtful, personal and impassioned.  Whether describing Thanksgiving with her parents or her reaction to the presidential victory of Mr. Bush (a highlight of the volume is this essay and its skillful presentation of Gore as a nerd, in a very positive way).  After this past election, this volume is a wonderful way to overcome a little and laugh a lot.  A much needed writer in these terrible times.	2002-11-10

I remember being given the first book, The Land That Time Forgot, by my father and devouring it, followed quickly by the next two volumes.  My tastes were not sophisticated but my eagerness was in the extreme and these three books took me away to a place of dinosaurs, evil Germans, stalwart heroes, beguiling animal-skinned beauties and a mystery that defied evolution (or, more precisely, any known logic or science).  I was truly in the land before time: childhood.  Imagine my joy on discovering all three very short books wrapped in a modern new package that I could feel confident reading on a commute to work without undue embarassment.  These books are still fast paced and have a truly pulpy, nostalgic feel to them.  They can grow repetitious read all at once and perhaps the border between pulpy and musty is a fine one.  They are more adventure and action stories than tales of the imagination (although the third installment does conjure quite a number of interesting images).  The writing is simple and the dialogue is ludicrous.  But the whole experience is still a delight as I was transported back and for that I am thankful for this wonderful new edition.	2002-11-06

This book is itself not quite a biography as it concentrates mainly, although not exclusively, on Boswell's life as it pertains to the creation of his book.  It is also not a careful examination of the book Boswell wrote itself.  Instead, it is a fascinating view of the human interactions, both between subject and author, but also those between the author and his sources before and after Johnson's death, that went into the creating process.  The literary masterpiece that came to be the Life of Johnson was born out of the social and cultural mileau both men enjoyed in London and this is well recreated in this book.  This is a readable, sometimes funny, sometimes touching book.	2002-10-28

This novel is structered in a more traditional narrative manner but soars on its layers of complexity and riveting characters, particularly the CEO Gladstone fleshed out fully and wonderfully in this novel, among the many fascinating characters.  Occasionally the story veers slightly into a new age viewpoint but an edge is added with humour to keep any of these moments from becoming mushy.  These two books together form a wonderfully rich science fiction classic that moves from religion to politics to science to fantasy to noir fiction to poetry and back again.  A worthwhile journey.	2002-10-25

The Great Fire of London (In That Apocalypitic Year 1666) is a fascinating tale and the book moves along at the same speed as the firestorm itself.  The reader will learn more than they may have expected to about fires and the author takes one into the aftermath of this horrific event.  The book is all surface but often it shines.  The frustrating elements include the author's putting thoughts into the historical personalaties throughout that there is no way of knowing the validity, merely that it fits the author's own perceptions of how somebody should be feeling at that time.  For those looking for some historical thrills, this might be the ticket.	2002-10-12

In the Devil's Snare is a fascinating book.  It is not as thrilling and easy to read as some other histories of the event (such as the re-released Francis Hill book) but looking at the conflict on the frontiers of the territories with the Indians and its impact on pushing the witchcraft crisis to greater heights will interest those who have read other accounts.  The fit is not always perfect but it does give one much to consider.  The book is well researched and of particular interest will be the gossip networks unearthed by the author showing how information was spread from distant counties.  It's a small New England world after all.  A fresh look at a horrific event and strongly recommended for anyone wishing to understand this event.	2002-10-09

A book for kids is the perfect follow-up to the wonderful Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Klay and it shows the author's gift for narrative to be as strong as ever and the story moves swiftly and breathlessly.  The imaginary worlds he creates in Summerland come as more of a surprise, as they are both fresh and familiar as the same time.  It may lack the sense of wonder of the Harry Potters or the complexities of His Dark Materials but it touches elements of both and brings in a little Americanism (reminiscent of Baum) along with it.  He has turned the national sport into the stuff of myths and legends and turned the stuff of myths and legends into daily life.  It is both a rollicking adventure story and a sweet meditation on story telling with (its only drawback to this non-fan) a lot of baseball.  It is truly a modern American fairy tale.	2002-10-03

Republic of Dreams (Greenwich Village:  The American Bohemia, 1910-1960) consists of mini-biographies for chapters as it is not so much a history of the Village as it is a history of the significant people who made the Village their home, sometimes briefly and sometime for life.  The idea is presented that the Village was only truly the Village as it exists in lore in the 1910s.  Three-quarters of the book is devoted to this period and this is the funniest, most touching and most fascinating part of the book.  All of the lives covered in this first period intersect creating a true picture of a community of artists, actors, writers, labour leaders, society matrons, anarchists and hangers-on that create a unified whole in the book.  The last quarter of the book (covering the next forty years) feels a little uncooked, while still being interesting.  This book is an incredible place to spend a number of hours and a great chance to meet the people who made the Village the Village.	2002-09-29

They take a look at certain characters (Superman, Fantastic Four, Spiderman, Batman, Atom and Ant-Man, Hulk, X-mutants, Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman and Sub-Mariner) and examine particular aspects of their origin or powers in light of what is known about science.  The book could have a light-hearted debunking romp but the science sections are very series and weighty, perhaps too much.  As a former (?) comic nerd who never reached uber-nerd status by combining that love with a love of science, it was interesting to see these two authors take one love to attack another, particularly as they digress into science topics that are clearly their favourites.  The chapter that is the most fascinating, though, is the loving one on Donald Duck comics at the end of the book.  An interesting look at science in a quick and easy read that will be scooped up by comic fans.	2002-09-21

Richard Bernstein, using his and much of the staff of the New York Times' research over the past year, pieces together the development of recent terrorism and mixes in the personal histories of the hijackers as one theme, while also looking at the personal histories of the victims in the towers and on the planes on that fateful day and before.  The terrorist background information is horrifically fascinating and laid out very clearly, which is of great benefit to the reader as the various themes can become confusing.  The actual reporting on the events of the day is vivid, clear, and heart-rending.  The book is a little weaker on giving the background of the victims as they become very similar in this telling as their similarities as Americans are emphasized.  To paraphrase, good people are good in all the same ways but bad people are bad in all different ways.  Some of the editing is a little loose at times and certain stock phrases creep into the writing.  Still, this is a powerful journalistic account covering the entire sweep of events.  Individual books on many of the separate elements would, ultimately, be more helpful but this book provides a sweep and momentum that will carry the reader through this time of history with more knowledge and deep grief.	2002-09-20

This book examines the distinctively American holidays of Indepndence Day, Thanksgiving, Columbus Day, Presidents' Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day and Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  The author traces the origins and development of these holidays in an interesting, informative and thorough manner.  The delight in this book, though, is the inclusive nature of its treatments.  The examination of the Indian reaction to these holidays is wonderfully illuminating.  In fact, the most important aspect of this book is the ways in which it demonstrates how all shades of the political spectrum and all peoples within the United States have used and developed these holidays.  Eventually all of these holidays become drained of meaning but this road to complacency, as shown in this book, is fascinating and varied.	2002-09-18

The author's, Thomas Bender, view is expansive and always intellectually sound as it ranges from architecture to Walt Whitman to cultural politics to Beat poets to democracy and to universities, and these are only a few of the ideas integrated smoothly into the book.  Some of the concepts may be a little difficult for the uninitiated (myself, at times) but the writing is so smart and clear that the reader will fall into place quickly enough.  A wonderful book and one of the best examinations of New York to be encountered.	2002-09-12

The information will prove familiar for those who have studied this period but the author throws in opinions at many points to keep his version fresh.  This book, though, is perfect for the beginner.  It is more than a survey yet not at all bogged down with scholarly detritus.  One of the most pleasant discoveries is that this book is not a form of idol worship posing as history (as the subtitle threatens) but a balanced account with examinations of how past historians have looked into the material and how new research changes the interpretations.  An easy and satisfying read.	2002-09-06

And he does almost literally go all around it, as well as taking several journeys into its dusty heart.  My only regret with this book is that I read it after coming back from Australia rather than before I began that particular journey.  I do not know that I would have changed any destinations, as the author is most hilarious and poignant when describing places into which one would probably never venture, but this book makes one appreciate the Australia that one encounters much more fully.  This book is recommended for those who have seen Australia, those who will see Australia and those who may never see Austarlia.  In short, this book will amuse and delight everyone, much like the wonderful country it documents.  During the day see something you can see no where else in the world and in the evening go to pub and relive the experience over a few pints, but first read this book.	2002-08-30

In a Delusion of Satan, the author tells the grippping and horrifying story from beginning to end in a fast-paced narrative that takes the reader through every pertinent detail. Along the way, she discusses motives, both psychological and material, that may have influenced the participants, as well as briefly glancing at the number of theories that have arisen in our more modern times. The author does not provide a large historical context in which to slide the events into, perhpas, but she does give just enough details to keep this story comprehensible and fascinating. The book does not dwell on modern analogies (they are too painfully obvious, at any rate). A recommended look at this terrible time.	2002-08-26

Lusitania (An Epic Tragedy) has all the appropriate elements with its combinatin of action, mystery, double-dealing, cowardice, villiany, with even a little romance thrown in.  She handles all of these elements with great aplomb and with even more skill than her previous ventures (Boxer Rebellion, A First Rate Tragedy, both recommended if you like Lusitania.)  The set piece is, of course, the sinking and the author does not fail to deliver but even more interesting is her later chapters showing the impact of the sinking on Germany, Britain and, particularly, the United States.  She still has a tendendcy to come across as an apologist but it is more tempered in this book.  A wonderful summer read.	2002-08-22

All the major characters are there plus a few (too few) surprises, such as the Zombie.  This is a nice book to reminisce with or, for the very beginner, to catch up on past history.  Most of the colour remains in the pictures (and there is a wonderful healthy selection of those) as the writing tells the story effectively but without the excitement of the characters being described.  The book could have used more opinions (good, bad, or ugly) but this is not that kind of book.  It is a straight ahead history looking at the amazing changes and the even more delightful consistencies of the weird lot peopling the Marvel Universe.  A nice walk down memory lane (and a chance to see just how much has already changed since this book came out in 1996.)	2002-08-21

Each of these essays looks at a different novel from the realist genre of the nineteenth century from three different countries; Bleak House, Madame Bovary, Buddenbrooks.  The essays are connected by the Peter Gay's examination of the usefulness of these books to historians and by the authors of these novels' anger against their society and the revenge they take against it within their novels.  It is easy to see how these essays were brought to life as lectures but they work quite effectively as written works as well.  This book will even be of interest to those who have not read the particular novels in question.  The epilogue is the crowning achievment of the book and well worth the price of admission.  A short, quick, fun spin through the world of novelists, historians and the nineteenth century.	2002-08-15

(The Smashing Rise and the Giddy Fall of Swinging London) is a tale told with a great deal of affection by its author Shawn Levy.  This is a wonderful book for the summer and a nice answer to the Austin Powers movie, as the actual time and place was more giddy than any satire could ever imagine.  There was a darkness to this time as well but that is not the story the author wants to focus on as, other than the last few pages, the book is about the first half of the sub-title, and is it a smashing story indeed.  Some of the stories (read: gossip) will be familiar but the author spins them out with delicious care.  This book was successful in making me envious of those who were there but also effective in making me happy that I did ultimately get to spend a little time there through this book.  There is no depth and no analysis, per se, in the stories only a tapestry of a time but it adds up to a fun read.	2002-08-13

Lawrence M. Friedman has contributed Law in America (A Short History) that is not exactly a traditional history but more an quick and easy to read examination of the importance of the law in America and how it not separate from society but actually an integral part of its surrounding culture, not leading but not entirely led by this zeitgeist.  The author touches on many important court cases to back this theory but he also broadens the very concept of law beyond the court room and expands it to include, appropriately, the government in all its aspects, from the Senate to police officers, from the Food and Drug Administration to marriages.  He also show the ongoing centralization of the law in America, particularly through the Supreme Court, despite limited attacks on this by the recent Supreme Court. This is an essay that will prove fascinating to the non-specialist.	2002-08-08

The author, Fernand Braudel (as translated by Sian Reynolds from a text edited by Roselyne de Ayala and Paule Braudel), uses all the skills that have made him renowned as one of the more important historians of the twentienth century in this venture.  This book was the first volume of a planned series about the history of the Mediterranean by different authors with this volume being the first.  The series never happened and this book was, therefore, never published during the author's lifetime.  It is to our benefit that it is now being published posthumously.  The history begins prior to Neolothic and takes the reader through to the Roman Empire.  There is wonderful writing, many moments of humour and the strongly held opinions of a historian who has earned his stubbornness.  Some of the earlier ideas have been challenged or, even, defeated by later archeology but these are explained in the end notes as not to disrupt the wonderful flow of the narrative.  The chapter on the Greeks, particularly the pre- and early classical period, is the most interesting.  A book of this type covers too large a time period for any significant analysis but this book is effective as a journey, through both history and history writing.	2002-08-07

Oren's Six Days of War (June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East) is an engrossing account of the Six Day War (June War), including a lengthy beginning placing the war in its historical context. The author's research in Isreali, Russian and American records is quite evident and put to effective use.  The story as told from Egyptian and, to a lesster extent, Jordonian perspective is quite complete and fascinating as well.  Unfortunately, Syria seems a little vague and the Palestinians are left without a voice in the history at all. This book pivots the story on the Isreali viewpoint predominantly and, bearing this caveat in mind, the reader can get a sense of history from this book, as well as enjoy the exciting ride through this war that has helped shape the difficult situation the world is in today.	2002-08-02

Masters of Death (The SS-Einsatzgruppen and the Invention of the Holocaust) will bring the reader quite close to the horrificly committed mass murders from both the perspectivie of the killers and the victims (of those very few who managed to survive).  There is a little pyschobabble near the beginning mixed in with small bios of Hitler and Himmler that does not entirely hold together but it is minimal and, in no way, interferes with the important story told here.  The author shows how the killing of Jews in Eastern Europe developed the methods and hardened the men, by making horror routine, to the Holocaust that followed of whiich these first years of killings were a part.  This book is an important addition to Holocaust literature by an accomplished writer.  This book is both very hard to read and difficult to put down.	2002-07-27

He is a scholar studying scholars, particularly those that comprised a Republic of Letters, humanists from the Renaissance until the Enlightenment.  One of his favourites, Joseph Scaliger, is not a name that comes to many minds from this period of intellectual history in Europe but it will stay there after reading about him in two of the author's essays.  Bring Out Your Dead (The Past as Revelation) has many fascinating portraits throughout,told in an erudite and witty style that will be understandable by readers with only a basic understanding of this period.  It is interesting to see how the people of our past studied and used the history of their past.  The reader is lucky to have Mr. Grafton as a guide through this journey as we navigate this hall of mirrors.  I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it after struggling with many unfamiliar names and concepts at the beginning.  A worthwhile read.	2002-07-24

It was read aloud to me in school when I was in Grade Five and it still has the same power to entrance now that I older.  In fact, there is a new appreciation for this book as it takes me away from my stuffy adult self, much like Mr. Baggins at the beginning, content in my little hole with my daily routine. I completely forgot that dragons are real, dwarves are surly, goblins are not to be trusted, magic is common, and a ring can begin an adventure.  This volume does not have the scope of the trilogy (except in the last chapters) and can fell ever so slightly twee at times but it has enough charm to take one to a magical place.  And that, after all, is the joy of reading.	2002-07-19

I had to have this issue with these two stars.  That was the true appeal of the first couple of years of this series, anticipating the wonderful match-ups and catching a first glimpse of those wonderful covers with two heroes in full-throated action, such as the wonderful sight of Spider-Man battling the Werewolf (by night) on a bridge in San Fransicso.  Many of the stories do not live up to the promise and it was hard to develop more complicated stories in this format.  In fact, the most developed storyline (extending over three issues and involving Spider-Man, the Human Torch, the Avengers, and the Inhumans) was the weakest.  The writing improved with the addition of Len Wein and the art was generally quite good, particularly as done by Gil Kane (see his wonderful work with Captain America, Spider-Man and the Gray Gargoyle, one of the best stories in the series).  The stars tend to be the more famous characters of the Marvel universe, with Human Torch hogging too much of the spotlight (thankfully in the case of the classic Human Torch/Iceman dust-up) but there are occasional appearance by such rarely seen characters as Brother Voodoo.  All in all, this is a wonderful volume and a delightful trip down memory lane.  Where else could one see Spider-Man and the Ghost Rider (he of the flaming head) battle a villian whose head is one giant eye, the Orb.	2002-07-18

The book is, rather, a honest examination of the ups and downs in the struggle towards a concept of universal suffrage.  The anti-democratic forces won many victories during the course of this history and continue to have an effect on today's political and judicial decisions.  This book is a little daunting at first as it is quite thorough in its research and presentation (beginning with property qualifications in all of the first states) and is not about the fiery personalities involved in these two centuries of thrust and parry.  The book grows more fascinating as the narrow focus (right to vote) spreads into its own mosiac representing all of America and its beliefs on a fundamental level.  An important and readable study.	2002-07-17

The case studies are horrific and do not lose any of their impact as the stores build up over the course of the book, in fact they become more horrible.  In contrast to these important, but terrible, aspects the author provides the reader with excellent portrayals of such courageous figures such as W.E.B. DuBois and Ida Wells.  This is a perfect one volume place to begin to study and learn about this chapter of American history as it covers the entire history of the nation and puts the events in their political, social and economic context.  This is a large, readable account that is gripping and illuminating into the darkness of this time not so long ago or far away.  Highly recommended.	2002-07-10

The author pares the story down to its essentials, the bloody mutiny and its aftermath.  Some historical context is lost in the rush (for that readers should consult the excellent In the Heart of the Sea by Nathaniel Philbrick, a wonderfully detailed book covering the same historical period).  What may be lacking in context is replaced by breathtaking, and often bloody, action.  This is the perfect summery beach history book that provides thrills without sacrificing intelligence.	2002-07-03

Farnsworth and Sarnoff of the title make interesting protanganists and steep this book in human interest.  The story droops at times but it still generally makes for a fascinating read.	2002-06-29

His life story includes many wonderful anecdotes that go beyond the world of science and include such a unusual assembly of characters as Trotsky, Harpo Marx and Evelyn Waugh.  The joy of this book, though, is the biological experiences and this will be a pleasure regardless of one's level of biological background.  The excitement of discovery and learning comes through clearly in these pages and the amazing transitions in this field over the past century are presented in a readable and fascinating manner.  This is a light, friendly read and a gentle glimpse into the sometimes cloudy world of biological research.	2002-06-26

The Hitler of History is not a biography in any sense of the word although biographical details of Hitler's life are presented throughout and, often, in very illuminating ways.  This book looks at the historians and the historiographical problems surrounding Hitler (and there are many of both).  It is not necessarily for the uninitiated but will be more useful to those with a little background knowledge of the various theories being promoted and with some of the work already out there.  There will be a little (or a lot) to upset any historian but there is also much to consider.  The last chapter is a corker both to read and to contemplate and sums up much that has gone before in a well-written, lucid and exciting manner. This book is not the place to first read about Hitler, but it should undoubtably be the second place.	2002-06-23

The author's likes and dislikes are there for any one to see as he traces the performance history of a song, concentrating on jazz performers and Frank Sinatra while giving less space to other pop, cabaret or theatrical performances.  For what he does cover, he covers well.  The true test of a book like this is whether it makes one rush to listen to various interpretations of these songs, such as Louis Armstrong doing Star Dust or Ella Fitzgerald doing Mack the Knife (a personal favourite) or, even better, the more obscure gems the author relates.  The book suceeds marvelously in this aspect as it will turn the reader into an eager listener as one moves between CD player and comfy reading coach.  One does not have to agree with all of his conclusions (in fact, one is unlikely to) but the reader will enjoy the experience.	2002-06-20

The play does not lose its impact as a piece of literature divorced from its theatrical presentation.  This portrayal of Salem witch trials was written as a shadow commentary on the McCarthy trials but the play still has a terrible relevancy to today's raucous world.  This play rips away the black-and-white, simple good-and-evil view of the world of many leaders and shows the relativism and the dangers of such view points.  Aside from this, though, this play is entertaining in a very breathtaking way with very powerful character portrayals that makes these historical personalities both universal and powerfully true to their historical period.	2002-06-13

It is a brief and easy read presenting clearly and emphatically the conservative view of Napoleon (directly blaming him for Hitler and Stalin did seem stretching things, even amongst the other vilifying).  The story is all there and it should interest readers and entice them to learn more and discover for themselves all sides of this complex character in history.  With a subject like Napoleon there is no limit to the viewpoints and books out there and this particular book should lead the eager reader to search them out but no where will this specific view of Napoleon be found so succintly and engagingly written.	2002-06-12

There are much worse versions out there (Pellegrino) but, unfortunately for this volume, there are much better.  Walter Lord's two books set the standard and Wynn Craig Wade nicely follows it.  There will be nothing new in this volume, other than the author's political conservatism seeping into the account.  Much like the recent spate of books concerning the disaster at the Antartic with the expedition of Robert F. Scott, this book tries to preserve the image of the heroic British empire and see these man-made failures as triumphs of the character of the upper class British (and by inference, American) male.  The beating of this particular drum can get a little repetitious.  The Titanic, though, is always a fascinating and tragic story and the author keeps the narrative moving along nicely.	2002-06-06

Like all of these books, it is laboured with a sub-title that is a little too large for its small size.  The book is most interesting when it focuses on fingerprinting rather than when it is trying to expand the topic to crime detection in general.  Nevertheless, this a bright, breezy, easy read with a cast of bitter, feuding scientists, a few well-placed murders strewn throughout, and a climatic court room battle.  This book possesses no great depth, but it skims the surface beautifully and makes for an enjoyable ride.	2002-05-29

Instead of looking at archaeology as a way to provide evidence to the stories of the Bible, they have looked at the archaeological evidence alone for what it can say about what was happening at the time and then compared that to the stores contained within the bible.  Their conclusions turn the Bible away from being a book of true history into a being a political creation and a well-crafted book of mythmaking for the state of Judah as it grew and consolidated its power.  The tale is fascinating and they do give much room to the other dissenting opinions, of which there are many.  At times, the repetition of pounding their themes home can be a bit much but, overall, it is an interesting read and a good place to start to look at the fascinating world of Biblical archaeology.  A good read.	2002-05-27

Seabiscuit (An American Legend) is a wonderful slice of American sports history that uses the legendary horse of the title to lead the reader through a part of the 1930's rarely glimpsed by most books of history.  The author fills in the details of this horse racing world with colourful anecdotes and touching, telling details.  The historical aspects of this books are all handled with delightful aplomb.<br />The most amazing part of this book, though, is the way in which the author describes the races themselves.  Her writing is fast and breathless, like the horse race being portrayed, and this narrative will grab the reader in a way most history books never could.  For somebody with no interest in horse racing, but bought the book for a love of history, I was surprised at how anxious I became while reading the parts about the races and could not wait until the next one.  This is a very well put together book that will educate and excite in one rollicking package.	2002-05-23

The author has earned the right to tell these stories and does well by them as a journalist.  He concentrates on the Big Men, the tyrants whose personalities are behind the anarchy and slaughter in Africa, and shows how the situations are manipulated by these men (and this includes, pointedly, a representative of the United States in the chapter on the assistant secretary of state) to maintain their persoanal power at the expense of the people of whom they are responsible.  It is frightening story and, despite the author's small ray of hope added at the end, seemingly impossible to change.  This is a great book for those who want to see the situation in Africa beyond the meager news reports of victims and villians.	2002-05-17

Simon in What Kind of Nation (Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, and the Epic Struggle to Create the United States) takes a look at the crucial and fascinating first decades of the founding of America.  This period of growth pains is among the most interesting aspects of American history and the author has selected a particular conflict between titans that is very effective is showing the two divergent sides to the title question, what kind of nation.  It is particularly nice to see John Marshall given equal billing as the Thomas Jefferson material will be the most familiar and chewed over.  The book tips towards becoming too legalistic but never actually does as it remains solidly readable and generally entertaining.  A nice look at a tumultous time.	2002-05-14

The author has filled in the life of one of the important personalities from the herioc age of arctic exploration in such a way as to deepen the understanding of the men how took this challenge, particularly both before and after the adventure of their lives.  Cherry, of course, wrote the classic and indispensible, The Worst Journey in the World, the finest book written by an actual explorer himselfself.  He is the perfect subject and his life makes for an exciting and interesting read.  Sara Wheeler has written a wonderful book that touches on many important events in the life of the early twentienth century and the passing (sadly for Cherry) of the Victorian Age.  It is an enjoyable book that equals or surpasses many of the books in the past couple of decades looking solely at the Antartic adventure.  Read it. Enjoy it.	2002-05-10

I am not sure if the subtitle is true concerning this being the bloodiest mutiny ever but I would not want to learn about one more bloody.  The author does a good job of presenting the details of the actual mutiny in an exciting and readable manner, and even a better job of giving an historical context for the events without swamping the tale.  It illuminates as it reaches into darkness.  The story of the ship Batavia in 1628 and the psychotically cruel and mad plans of Jeronimus Corneliszoon will shock even jaded twenty-first century readers.  This book is not for the faint at heart but will be gripping for readers not afraid to look at history's darker moments.	2002-05-03

The facts that make this case so very interesting are that this particular invalid claimed not to have eaten for at least twelve years, have clairavoyant powers, and been able to read despite being (hysterically) blind.  These attributes connect her with a larger history outside her bedroom.  The author takes the story back into the past with the medieval fasting saints and into the present with anorexia nervosa girls.  The story, at its most interestng, winds its way through many aspects of the nineteenth century, including science, relgion, philosophy, and spirtuality.  The author often tackles the subject more as a journalist than a historian, skimming the surface.  It is still a fun and enjoyable ride through the nineteenth century as seen through the life of one very celebrated invalid.	2002-04-29

He has crafted a magnificently beautiful tale of two boys in love that expands into the larger world of politics and class and patriotism, just a few among the many ideas shaded throughout this wonderful book.  The Irish voice is thick and may prove a challenge for a few pages but the beauty of its poetry will seep into the reader before long and carry one along on its delicious brogue.  The reader's Patience is rewarded in this book most thoroughly and thoughtfully.  It is nice to read a gay novel that is this rich with so many well-drawn characters, the boys' fathers and the other gay man's aunt, beyond those of the title characters.  This novel is a richly written slice of Irish history and about fighting for freedom in all its contexts.	2002-04-24

Kaplan, of F**kedcompany.com fame, has gathered together very short snippets of spectacular dot-com flameouts (as per the sub-title), in F'd Companies.  These pieces are funny, vulgar and sized just right for bathroom reading.  Fans of the website will have seen most of these before and enjoy them all gathered together and others may become fans of the website through this book.  There is no insight into the disastrous dot-bomb years and nothing should strike the reader as wisdom.  It is mainly pointing fingers and laughing at the insanity of it all.  Some readers will be turned off by the authors continual reference to touching himself and other such tidbits thrown in but he would not be having a good day if he did not offend someone.  It is more fun than it deserves to be.	2002-04-19

This short volume will fulfill all the expectations promised by the sub-title, which is more than enough.  This is historical journalism (complete with the author's own prescence throughout the story) rather a work of history as it skims the surface of the Victorian world.  It is,,though, the stuff of old fashioned English murder mysteries with its mysterious poisoning, clandestine affairs, competent and brooding lady companions, and, especially, its English country house (although set on the edge of London).  The author covers all of this rich territory effectively and adds to this story with all of his fascinating new research. For lovers of murder mysteries or even simply a good tale, this will be sure to please.	2002-04-12

The author tells an exciting story and was able to effectively destroy the grand heroic myth of Scott and his run for the South Pole while resurrecting Amundsen as the genius of exploration that he was.  Huntford's influence is easily shown in the various volumes since then specifically trying to re-establish Scott among the pantheon of Arctic heroes instead of the its crown fool.<br />The narrative is handled well and told in an appropriately breathless, gripping manner.  The author beats down Scott and builds up Amundsen a little too strongly and frequently instead of letting the story itself make his point a little more quietly but this is a minor quibble for those who love a cold tale of exploring told with such heat.  A fine job that has spawned an industry of writing.	2002-04-10

There is the usual cast of fascinating (not likeable) characters with more than the usual assortment of compulsions and deceits driving them and the plot.  At times, the quirks seem a little forced as even very minor characters are burdened with a glaring oddity or two, taking the heat from the major characters.  The suspense is toned down to focus on the psychology and too much of the plot is telegraphed.  A tighter, narrower focus on a lesser number of characters could have been more compelling.  It is still a good read but not as good as one should expect from the author of the wonderful Wexford series, as well as her other delicious, weird mysteries.	2002-04-04

Perelman (part of the Humor and Wit series of Modern Library) is a lengthy, though abridged, volume of the Perelman pieces from 1930 - 1958, many of which originally appeared in the New Yorker, among other magazines.  This book should not necessarily be read straight through, as I did to my slight regret, as it can become a little overwhelming.  There is some dating in the material but it is more of a delight how little effect time has taken on the comedy.  The best pieces are, without a doubt, the marvelous Cloudland Revisited sequences where the author looks at books and movies he admired in his youth to see what horrible things time, experience and maturity have done to them.  These selections are the treasures of the volume.  A fine look at the almost lost art of a certain form of humour writing at its height.  A wonderful volume to be savoured slowly.	2002-03-28

The novel plays a science fiction variation on the Canterbury Tales as the pilgrims in the story each relate their six individual stories, beginning with the priest's tale.  This structure allows the reader to glimpse parts of the mystery of their quest with each story and watch the layers of narratives build up into a delightful structure.  Along the way echoes of such divergent authors as Robert Heinlein, Raymond Chandler, Stephen King and William Gibson sound throughout the stories while the voice always remains in the able hands of the author.  The theme of time is played with marvelously throughout the novel as it becomes, in a sense, another character.  As the Canterbury Tales slides into the Wizard of Oz the book ends, but this reader eagerly looks forward to beginning the next part of the tale.	2002-03-21

A Necessary Evil (A History of American Distrust of Government) is a book that begins slow but picks up glorious momentum as it glides along.  The author has truly created an all-encompassing look at the factors creating and the results stemming from anti-governmentalism that sometimes feels a little too broad-ranging in its topics but interesting enough through of all this added weight.  It should make the reader look at their attitudes a little closer as well as challenging many of the assumptions easily held concerning icons such as Jefferson, Madison (particularly fascinating) and Thoreau, to name but a few of the sacred cows served for lunch in this book.  The author is most fervent and interesting when attacking fellow academics who hold and ennoble many of the anti-governmental views thoroughly taken apart in this book.  The ending is great and potently timely with its assailing government for its secrecy.  A wonderful book that should get people talking.	2002-03-18

It is peopled with all the usual characters of a western novel but this time the usual themes of rugged individualism inherent in such works are turned on their heads.  The author puts all of these stock characters to use in showing his ideas concerning lynching and the true spirit of the west.  Each chapter reads like a set piece with much dialogue.  It often feels like it is trying to work as a play but, for full effectiveness, it was right that it be set as a western novel, the place where many of the myths of the West first became established.  The novel picks up momentum and finds much tension and emotional truth strew among all the larger examinations of ideas.  It is gripping, both in the gut and in the mind.	2002-03-10

Evans and Keith Skinner, is exactly what it purports to be in the subtitle.  It is a discussion of all the letters sent by people purporting to be Jack the Ripper to the newspapers, police and assorted individuals followed by a section printing all of the letters in the police files (there is little variety in the letters themselves showing the lack of imagination shown by most of the copy cat letter writers and this could prove a little dry for some).  In addition, this volume is generously filled with photos of the letters themselves.  This book is not for the beginner in the Ripper mythology as it focuses strictly on the letters and will be of most interest to those who have a basic understanding of the case already.  This volume is a worthy addition to the Ripper books and will keep the legend alive for the next generation.	2002-03-08

Daniel Defoe's A Journal of the Plague Year is an interesting volume that blends fact and fiction quite indiscriminately, as the author intended.  It is easy to forget it is fiction as it reads as fact (and it seems likely there are enough actual facts strewn throughout as to enhance this perception).  Defoe was less concerned about these issues concerning fiction and non-fiction than modern readers and writers and it is fascinating to see an example of the early beginnings of novel writing.  The style could frustate some readers (there is virtually no attempt at characters and only small strands of a narrative per se) but the descriptions of a town in crisis were both gripping and fascinating.  An unique volume.	2002-03-04

It begins with his first appearance as well as containing his origin story in a later issue and the first appearance of Robin the Boy Wonder.  Bob Kane's Batman as portrayed in Batman Archives Volume 1 is a very dark creation at first.  The violence is quite intense as Batman's foes end up being pierced through, necks broken or falling to their deaths, if not actually shot with the gun Batman sometimes carried at his side.  This level of violence was already decreasing when the garishly garded Robin made his appearance and is gone by the end of this Volume. The villains include Dr. Death, Hugo Strange, the Joker and Clayface, along with a vampire and the usual suspects of assorted crime bosses.  There is a nice gothic feel to many of the stories and drawings, with the exception of a fantasy story involving giants and tiny people which looks forward to the idiotic mess of stories that will haunt the Batman comics in the 1950's.  At any rate, this is a great volume to begin a look at the origin and development of an icon, as well as being entertaining itself.	2002-03-03

They are not overly complicated as to be challenging with just enough twists and turns as to be diverting and no more.  The humour is always a delight without overwhelming the slender plot.  Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin are delightful creations and their relationship is both quite odd and yet quite enjoyable in its uniqueness.  The Golden Spiders is, perhaps, not the best Nero Wolfe mystery but this very quick and easy read will do the job.  A little bubble bath for the mind.	2002-02-28

It took moving to America for me to finally begin these novels and I am glad that I have done so.  This first book begins the series of novels off on a strong note.  Dunstan Ramsay weaves a wonderful narrative as he explores the life lived below the surface of this staid history professor at a boys' school.  The novel moves through geography and chronology as the various people in his life become twice born, dropping one identity and taking another (demonstrated by the creation of a new name).  Things are never quite so simple as the past lives come crashing in at odd times into their new lives.  It is a wonderfully magical and mystical (in many senses) journey and will be a delight to the reader.  I look forward to the other two books in the Deptford trilogy.	2002-02-25

The premise is classic murder mystery but the development is unique.  The authors cut from one chararcter's perspective to another quickly and often, including many of the criminals, in a way that can be sometimes disconcerting but frequently fascinating.  Their creation, Martin Beck, is the star and the book is dazzling when he is centre stage (which is not often enough, in my opinion).  This is not the typical mystery nor the typical police procedural but its examination of personality and crime in seventies Sweden is captivating.  This sense of time and place is so strong it becomes the core of this novel.  An interesting read.	2002-02-22

Wood faithfully fulfills the objectives of the fine Modern Libary Chronicles series, in The American Revolution (A History).  The author, in a short space, effectively gives a history of the American Revolution from its ecomonic, demographic and ideological origins through the war itself and into the second revolution, that of the creation of the constitution.  The story is told clearly and made interesting, sticking conservatively to the basic outline without adding any of the more radical views of recent years.  This volume is definately not for those overly familiar with the Revolution but would be a good beginning or a refresher for those interested in the outlines of this fascinating event.  All the major personalities makes brief appearances but the focus is on the revolution itself, as it should be.	2002-02-19

They show a great respect for the nineteenth century created myths surrounding the pilgrims while at the same time deconstructing them to present as realistic picture of this time as current research will allow.  Along the way, they touch upon crime, sex, marriage, material culture, and food to give a full picture of the lives lived in Plymouth Colony, both British and Indian.  The authors manage to make all of the archeological information quite palatable to the average reader.   A nice read.	2002-02-14

There are three major conflicts with the connecting thread the sub-storyline of the Batman being accepted back into the JLA after his removal (including some nice scenes with his old friend, Superman).  The wonderful use of fairy tales and the treat of seeing the heroes split apart from their secret identities give this volume its best moments to begin and end the book respectively.  The themes of fantasy and wish fulfillment are exploited with great skill in each of the stories.  Plastic Man is still an awkard fit in the League but the last story does at least provide a little emotional depth to his character.  It would be nice to have his skills and abilities being used more fully, in addition to his (at times forced) comic relief.  All in all, a good volume and more fine work from Mark Waid, who still manages to squeeze a little more juice from these (rather tired, at times) icons.	2002-02-09

The first part of the book is the historical buildup to the author's main playground, the years of fighting to fix the street from Lindsay to Giuliani (with a wonderful portrayal of Koch, for an added thrill) as the street moved from the Crossroads of the (Porn and Drug) World to a branch of the Disney franchise.  The book does deliver the sex, money, culture, and politics of its subtitle, in very healthy doses.  There are no startling revelations only many, many small thrills, much like the street itself.  An enjoyable read.	2002-02-08

It is a fascinating journey full of both noble and horrible characters and, generally, violent and restless times as, eventually, all of society is changed and many traditions are uprooted forever. The author builds a case (only partially successful) for the English translation of the Bible as one of the main progenitors for this revolutionary time, as opposed to merely a product of this time period.  This chicken and egg argument, though, should not distract the reader from the pleasure of soaking into this slice of history.  The book does flag somewhat in the last quarter as the creation of the King James bible does not have the drama of some of the story that has gone before (particulary the Wycliffe and, later, the Henry VIII bibles).  An interesting piece of pop and religious history.	2002-02-06

The book covers the Freemason from their beginning to the present going over every accusation ever hurled at them and dispeling it.  It is healthy and correct to remove much of the silliness that has surrounded freemasonry but, unfortunately, if you take away their grand conspiracies they become a lot of middle-aged men in robes meeting for secret handshakes and a couple of drinks, which seems even a little sillier.  The reader is never given a clear reason why anyone would join or even what the actual purpose of the Freemasons are, other than they are not trying to take over the world.  The book leaves many questions.  The journey the book takes, though, is filled with fascinating side streets along the way and should keep the readers interest.	2002-02-03

The journey encompasses many centuries and many delightful figures of the literary past, from John Boswell to F. Scott Fitzgerald, from Lord Lisle to M. R. James (in a wonderful section on Gothic shadows).  The two best chapters concentrate on the death (and life) of Thomas Chatterton and the life (and death) of Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin.  This book will be enjoyable for those who are not familiar with all the discussed writers' work (such as myself) as the writing is so clear and beautiful and the personalities examined so fascinating.  This book examines biography writing as an art form and thoroughly proves its case.  A charming read.	2002-01-30

The wonderful aspect of this is that most of it is quite interesting and will capture most readers quickly and take them easily and pleasureably through its pages, even if one never thought he had an interest in this topic.  The most fascinating aspects revolve around the subjects of map-making history and the more recent business of map collecting.  Both of these were fascinating and eye-opening.  The ending chapters are a little weaker as the book runs slowly out of steam but the reader should be exhausted and thrilled by that point, at any rate.  A wonderful first non-fiction book.	2002-01-25

She begins in the Golden Age and ends in the mid-90's and is quite thorough.  The concentration of the book is on the heroines of the golden age which should be interesting for most readers as this will be the least familiar period to many of them (and readers of other comic book histories will be surprised that there were so many women heroes fighting the good fight).  The section that is the most fun, though, is the discussion of the silver age and the recent period as the author allows herself a little more room for editorializing rather than simply surveying and Ms. Robbins opinions are always worth the wait. This area could even be expanded to into a book in its own right. The book is amply and appropriately illustrated.  This is a great book for anyone interested in comic books and their checkered history of portraying women.  But most of all it is a fun, breezy read.	2002-01-22

William J. Mann in Wisecracker (The Life and Times of William Haines, Hollywood's First Openly Gay Star) captures this time with exuberance.  The author shows the social scene and fills it out with many, many captivating stars and scandals, gossip and gay parties.  Williams Haines was young with the movies and it shows.  The added bonus of the book is the long portion of William Haines life during which he was not a movie star.  There is an emotional resonance to the last third of the book the deepens the fun of the first two-thirds.  A wonderful look at a life lived honestly for its time and the story of a love that survived for decades under all of that honesty.	2002-01-20

Rose put all of their many interviews to good use in War and Secession (Pakistan, India, and the Creation of Bangladesh).  They present all sides of the various complex relationships of this region, as well as presenting the fascinating international views of the situation, predominantly China, USSR, and the US.  They are careful to remain unbiased (perhaps sometimes a little too unbiased in the case of Bhutto, in my opinion) and present the misperceptions that all sides were using to base their decisions upon.  This book will also be a joy for the general reader as they make all the issues understandable and unravel all the tangles between the various personalities.  The authors provide a defintive account of the creation of Bangladesh that will both entertain and inform.	2002-01-14

This book begins a little drier than his previous works but picks up speed nicely with his discussions of Zorastrianism, Judaism, and very early Christianity while showing the connections between the former and the latter two in terms of its prophetic, apocalyptic writings.  This book makes a nice companion piece to this author's earlier and seminal work on millenniarism during the medieval period.  A fine addition to the Cohn canon.	2002-01-09

Guttridge, book The Ghosts of Cape Sabine.  But this should still satisfy those seeking another chance to spend some time in an arctic adventure (even on this chilly winter days) and will only dissappoint those who seek a hint of cannibalism with their tale.  This book has all the other usual elements of these stores, though, including betrayal, heroism, scientic stupidity, and, most of all, sheer perseverance in the face of insurmountable obstacles.  This book also has a little political subterfuge to add to the mix.  Another exciting re-addition to the polar canon.	2002-01-04

Weisberger's America Afire (Jefferson, Adams, and the First Contested Election) is a both a marvelous tale and a wonderful slice of history.  It covers similar ground (and the 1790's in America is probably one of the richest historical hunting ground around) as Joseph Ellis' Founding Brothers but in a more narrative fashion that will keep the reader gripped from beginning to end.  One of the great joys of this books is that it is not strictly about the election of 1800 but, rather, about the decade that preceded it and resulted in the nail biter showdown between Jefferson and Adams (and then in bizarre twist betweem Jefferson and Burr).  The book gets the story just right and manages to tell the sometimes complex tale in a comprehensible and straight forward manner to delight any reader.  A nice introduction to this fascinating period of American history.	2001-12-28

This book has the burden of describing a decade that will more than likely be a great deal familiar to his readers, certainly more so than previous books.  This is more than compensated for by just how personal the author makes the book.  The volume interjects opinion into fact (on occasion, blending the two).  This element is often quite enjoyable particularly in such juicy (and necessary) asides as George Abbott being taken down a couple of notches.  This book is actually more fun as a read than previous volumes while still being consistently sharp in its analysis.  A fine addition to this worthy series.	2001-12-23

Much of the basic story will be familiar from other histories of comic books but this author provides new insights into the foundation for the movement to censor comic books as well as providing a run down of the evolution of the comics code after the mid-fifites Senate hearings, an evolution very rarely discussed.  The author also makes valuable use of sources little used by other authors such as the minutes of the Comics Magazine Association of America.  All in all, a nice piece of research and a valuable contribution to the history of pop culture.	2001-12-22

The author manages to use the various Arab chroniclers and the, at times, complicated story they tell and turn it into a coherent, interesting, rich story of a people who watch as a mysterious invasion takes place and they first learn to deal with these strange invaders and later to expel them.  This book will be of interest to those not completely familiar with European versions of the Crusades but for those who have read or studied the Crusades in other books this will be a truly dazzling eye-opener.  An important book and an intersting read.	2001-12-18

But that, in many ways, is the pleasure of this book.  It looks at the twin towers from a perspective not clouded by the recent tradegy of the towers.  The author, Eric Danton in Divided We Stand (A Biography of New York's World Trade Center) is unflinching in looking at the creation of these towers on many fronts, including philosophical, economic and political, with the Rockefeller brothers playing the pivotal roles.  This book glosses over or ignores the building's technical aspects, for those who are interested (and truthfully, it would have been helpful at times to keep things in perspective).  The parts describing terrorism and the towers in ruins (and there are a number of times these are mentioned) are painfully chilling.  This is a honest examination of an important part of New York (and now American) history.	2001-12-17

Each chapter is written in a different style including one as a television play about an interview with a survivor of a Qumran sect living in Rome (his least successful chapter) and two chpaters told by time travelers to the ancient Roman Empire (moderately successful).  Only one chapter is presented in the usual style of &quot;objective&quot; history and even that could be an argued point.  He also includes throughout correspondence from colleagues in the field of ancient religious studies that are actually quite interestng and illuminating both for showing the complexity of religions in the Roman Empire as well as demonstrating the complexity of studying this ancient period in our own era.  Many of the bits do not work especially well but, as a whole, the book is very effective in painting a portrait of an era and a land that was awash in religion of all sorts as well as for demonstrating that is was more amazing than inevitable that orthodox Christianity would triumph over its many rivals.  This book is not a scholarly exercise but it should give the reader more of an interest in this fascinating period of history.	2001-12-10

Fenn's Pox Americana (The Great Smallpox Epidemic of 1775-82) is an interesting book that traces the course of this horrendous pox as it veers bloodily throughout the continent of North America.  It is very well researched and assembled with great skill.  The writing lacks a little narrative punch to carry it over to great pop history but it has all the details in the writing for the history fan to enjoy following this story.  The most interesting (and important) aspect of the pox story is the tale beyond the Revolutionary War in the rest of the continent, particulary the southwest, north (in Canada) and the Pacific Northwest (where the pox made first contact in many areas, ahead of Europeans).  This part of the story is effectively illuminated by the author.  An important book beyond its current terrorism inspired significance.	2001-12-02

Ellis' richly (and deservedly) rewarded book, Founding Brothers (The Revolutionary Generation), looks at six important events that helped form the stable government of the United States after the war for independence and the intellectual wars over the creation of the constitution had ended and before a new generation took up the mantle of state.  The period was primarily the 1790's, one of the richest decades in American history from which to mine and the author does a great job of finding and presenting some prime historical nuggets.  It is fascinating to see this band of brothers who fought a war divide themselves slowly into ideological camps that then transformed over the decade into parties while still preserving the precarious union that they all created without the shedding of blood, the Burr-Hamilton duel notwithstanding.  Adams comes out the best and Jefferson the worst in the narrative as many historians are swinging that direction lately but this will change again, showing that the debates raging in the 1790's are still raging in the history books today.  The reconciliation of these two friends is the most touching and noble section of the the book.  This is a lively and enlightening read.	2001-11-27

It is short and readable and captures all the salient facts of both Mozart's life and his works.  This is the perfect book for those who want a short read to enhance their listening and understanding pleasure.  There are better, more thorough accounts of Mozart's life but this volume dances over  much of the same territory while nicely peeling away the mythology clinging to Mozart through the centuries.  A bibliograhical note at the back will lead the readers who have become interested further down the garden path.  The other readers will be quite satisfied with what they have read in this compact, delightful book.	2001-11-26

It would have been more effective if it had been trimmed a little (there is some repetition) and published in a journal or beefed up by giving much needed context to the discussion to form a true book of history.  To enjoy this book a reader will have to already be familiar with the arguments surrounding the library at Alexandria and all the ancient sources that discuss it.  With the limited knowledge I possess, sometimes it grew confusing, as for instance, when the author would often move back and forth entire centuries in a single paragraph.  For those involved in their own arguments on this debate concerning the famous anceint library, this could be an interesting (or frustrating) book.  For everyone else, it could be just frustrating.	2001-11-17

The chapters on the God of the mystics and the God of the philisophers took the most time and some of it still left me perplexed, although still fascinated.  The author does a superb job of sticking closely to her theme of discussing the idea of God as it developed (a particularly illuminating section of the book) and changed over time.  It was a intellectually challenging book but well worth the time and effort that one will put into it.  Another fine job from this author, although I am sure that everyone will have their quibbles (such as short shrift on medieval Western Christianity and modern era Islam) and there are some nice surprises (such as the inclusion of Orthodox Christianity, a subject usually ignored).  A recommended book.	2001-11-14

This book in much different.  It stills has the spicy and, often, humourous writing but the approach is not what one might expect.  This book is about the author's adventures as he travels the same ground as the medieval knight, Sir John Mandeville.  It is not a history of the medieval period although the middle ages do occasionally enter into the story at times but rather a look at continuity through the ages.  It is interesting to see what changes and what does not and why.  Giles Milton is an entertaining guide in this adventure and despite his constant prescence, this reader never got tired of him.  Those expecting a book solving the mystery of Sir John Mandeville and examining his famous book of travels in detail will be dissappointed but those looking for a guide to the remaining Christian sites in the Mid-East are in for a treat.	2001-11-07

Baughman's Before the Heroes Came (Antartica in the 1890's) is an important look at the era before the Heroic Age of Scott, Amundsen, and Shackleton.  This very slim volume shows the build-up of interest in the Antartic and the politican and scientific forces coming together to propel both the noble and the foolish onto the triumph and tragedy that was the Antarctic after the turn of the century.  This book is essential for those with a passion for this frozen land but will leave those looking for another arctic adventure story a little cold.  The writing can be a little dry at times and the procession of scientists and sailors whirl by a little too quickly.  But for those who want to fully understand man's need to explore the Antarctic, this book will prove essential.	2001-11-03

It has remained in print because it is a sober analysis of the fantasies behind the persecutions of such dissenting Christians as the Waldensians which led horribly to the great witch-hunts of the early modern period.  The author helps remove much of the scholary nonsense that had accumulated onto the historical concept of witches in the past two centuries and puts them into their proper historical context. The book begins with a wonderfully enlightening glimpse of antiquity that is both illuminating and horrifying as the later fantasies against witches are first seen being used by Romans against early Christians.  This is a well-argued and presented book that deserves to remain in circulation as long as people continue to believe there was truth behind the accusations direct at these persecuted and demonized Christians of the Middle Ages. A superb book.	2001-10-30

Richard Wunderli captures simply and perfectly one of these moments in Peasant Fires (The Drummer of Niklashausen) when the peasants in Southern Germany are led on a very brief pilgrimage by the enigmatic peasant/shephard Hans Behem and his visions of Mary that threaten to turn the society upside down.  The author is great at capturing this period of time for the reader and setting the stage for the main event.  It is unfortunate that the main event itself could not be meatier but that is not the point.  A smaller eruption in society such as this is appropriate for this little volume.  It allows the general reader into medieval history a chance to get a clear look at an interesting time.  A well-written and presented book.	2001-10-25

Brown has left a slight memoir in The Evening Crowd at Kirmser's (A Gay Life in the 1940's) that gives a few brief, yet important, snapshots of a particular time and place.  The author pulls from his memories his experiences during a couple of years in a working class bar in St. Paul that had a gay and lesbian clientele once the sun rolled down.  It is interesting, for a change, to get a bit of gay history from a working class viewpoint and not from the one of the usual coastal cities of America.  For this reason, this is an important document and one wishes that there were many more like it.  The writing does not particulary sparkle and there are many questions still remaining but this book does present a broad range of characters that identify as being different and are simply looking for (and finding) companionship.  A fascinating little volume.	2001-10-22

Savage, Jr. had led the way in this brief volume, colourfully titled Commies, Cowboys and Jungle Queens (original title Comic Books and America, 1945 - 1954).  The author was among the first the look at the content of the comic books, read and passed around by millions of children and teenagers and not just a few adults, in terms of their comments on the culture which they reflected, such as the wonderful look at the Korean conflict as reflected in the comics.  This book led to the brilliant and highly recommended Comic Book Nation by Bradford W. Wright and for that it should be thanked.  This particular volume by William Savage is well-written, insightful, and often very funny.  Its main drawback is its brevity and lack of more comic panels for illustrative purposes.  All that aside, this is an enjoyable read.	2001-10-21

It is a difficult life in which to write a biography as the only sources for the life of the person were written down much later (centureies even) and are entirely part of a religious canon.  The author does a superb job of handling this challenge, treating the subject's religious significance with the care she shows to the more Middle Eastern monotheistic religions (Judiaism, Christianity, and Islam) that she usually tackles.  This book may frustrate those interested in the Buddha the man without a examination of the religion of Buddhism (impossible) or those looking for a book essentially on Buddhism in addition to a biography of Buddha (not possible in this small format).  This book is a wonderful compromise that should get readers excited about Buddhism and having having them explore further.  It not, the reader will still be left with the wonderful story of this incredible man and his beliefs.	2001-10-20

It tells the tale of the author's time on the coast of Scotland devoting the first half to his learning to live in this isolated paradise and the second half, slightly better, to his time consecutively with two otters (as well as other creatures, my favourite being the geese).  As anyone who loves animals will know, tears will factor into this tale, but never at the expense of the joy and laughter.  They are some very funny bits.  It would almost be enough to get me to exhange my cats for otters (almost, but not quite enough).  Some of the writing is a litte florid at times, particulary the brief section on killer whales, but, otherwise, this is an astounding and beautiful example of nature writing.	2001-10-19

The author captures a time with tremondous skill and evokes a atmosphere, both Gothic and Victorian, until it is practically dripping from the page.  Her real skill is in providing a story that is as absorbing as the atmosphere swirling around it.  This woman visitor, Margaret Prior, to the women's ward of Millbank prison provides a character and a narrative voice to carry the reader through both the chill of cold horror and the warmth of her erotic tinglings with equal skill.  The spiritualist prisoner she meets in prison, Selina Dawes, is a wonderful and original fictional creation that will haunt the reader as much as it does the lady visitor.  A fine read.	2001-10-17

The author examines the actions of the Pope, including his important pre-Papal days in Germany, during the horrible times leading up to the Second World War and, more importantly, the actions (virtual non-actions) of the Pope during the Holocaust, adequately representing the papal side of the issue.  Many will denounce these facts as anti-Catholic although the truth of the research stands up and has been substianted elsewhere.  Ignoring history and its lessons dooms one to repeat it.  This is an important and well-presented book on an aspect of a horrible time.	2001-10-17

He has written a book that is meant to appeal to people whose veiws are strictly politically conservative, love musicals (particulary fond memories of older musicals that they are in fact too young to have even seen) and do not know any actual facts about the history of the genre so the author's glaring mistakes will not prove an annoyance.  Even stranger is that he has found these people and, God bless them, they have the book they have always dreamed about.  For anyone else, this can be a bit of a slog.  It is funny (espcially if you like puns) in places but the arguments are so often backed up with mistakes as to be worthless.  This book is not truly bad.  It is just simply odd.  If you like Mark Steyn (this book is more about him anyway) then enjoy.  Othewise, it is worth a pass.	2001-10-17

Dick's finest, and certainly his most accessible, novels is the Man in the High Castle.  This is alternative history writing at its finest and he creates a plausible scenario of world in which Germany and Japan won the war without going to any weird science fictiony extremes.  The story is told brilliantly through the use of several characters representing different aspects of this new, yet somewhat famaliar, world as their lives are touched with many instances of Dicksian (much similar to Dickensian) coincidences.  The great variety of characters really allows the reader to see this other world in a natural manner.  And, of course, having a alternative history novel feature as an important element of the plot in an alternative history book just makes the whole concoction a little richer.  A book to read over and over.	2001-10-17

Wistrich's Hitler and the Holocaust is a fine addition to the Modern Library Chronicles Series (all of which are highly recommended).  This one sticks tightly to its title subject and will makes an effective beginning to future volumes which examine World War II in Europe and Nazi Germany.  The author examines the ideological origins of anti-Semitism and the Final Solution, the Holocaust as it was first established by Germany in Eastern Europe and its effects and results in the various countries involved (providing much needed glimpses of hope for humanity in such places as Denmark and, somewhat surprisingly, Italy amidst the unending horror).  The author looks at the response (non-response, really) of Britain and America, as well as various Jewish organizations outside of Europe, including Palestine.  It is slightly longer than the usual volumes in the series, at 240 pages of text, and this extra space is put to effective use.  This is good introduction to the subject before venturing in any deeper.  A great addition to a wonderful series.	2001-10-16

Paul Johnson puts the space to good use and is only hampered by the fact that an introduction without pictures of the Renaissance may leave the reader a little confused, in particular as there is a chapter each on sculpture, painting and buildings (the most interesting chapter).  The author is very good at briefly, yet succintly, taking the reader into the intellectual atmosphere that birthed the Renaissance and explaining its origins and dissappearance clearly.  Not the strongest in this wonderful series but still quite good.	2001-10-13

This is the best available book on Jack the Ripper and the best place to begin this gruesome journey before picking up the more fanciful tales and outrageous consipiracy theories (quite fun in their own weird way but, of course, are more about the authors than Jack the Ripper or his victims).  This is a long book that is as a complete as it title trumpets and is an essential component of any library looking at crime.  This tale will continue to tantalize and horrify and Philip Sugden's book makes the truth even more interesting and frightening than any of the legends.  And that is an amazing feat.	2001-10-10

There are obvious drawbacks to this system if one is expecting thorough and scholarly examinations of a particular topic.  These are designed for a quick look at a topic as a way to, hopefully, lead the reader further.  This books serves that purpose quite adequately.<br />The author looks at communism's rise and fall in the twentienth century.  He concentrates on personalities, moving from Marx (too briefly) to Lenin to Stalin, while touching on Mao and, even, Pol Pot.  The book is right wing tinged, in fairness Stalin did give plenty of ammunition for attack, with little examination of the other side of the Cold War.  Africa is presented, for example, as being manipulated by opportunistic dictators favouring Russia and Communism for their own purposes with not even a brief mention of the opposite number of dictators favouring the United States, such as in the Congo.  This will upset some readers but will hopefully lead them to other good books covering the entire spectrum of this debate.  For a short introduction into the horrors of communism, this book can not be beat.  For a look at the madness that fear of communism created in the Western World, the reader will have to look elsewhere.  But after reading this slim, readable volume, the reader will, at least, learn where the fear came from.	2001-10-04

The lure of this downed ship is undeniable and this book is a must-have for all those devoted to seizing and squeezing out as much information about the glorious ship and the wreck it became.  The book goes a little astray at times, though, as the author moves, far too often, from the Titanic's story to his own as we learn such tidbits as his wife left because she fell in love with another man and that the author was considered by some to be autistic as a child.  When he is on topic, he is quite good.  This book has much to recommend it to the Titanic reader.  For the beginner, Her Name, Titanic and Walter Lord's The Night to Remember are the places to begin and then, if still not satisfied, they can move on to this book.	2001-10-03

Instead this book is actually more about the journalist's, the author, own personal search for the truth behind the stories of Pope Joan, rather than Pope Joan herself, although she is there in plenty.  This is more than just an ego project though (although it certainly has moments of that) and it is an interesting and different way of making this book stand out from the various other Pope Joan books in existence and actually drawing the reader closer and personally into the legend.  The author is certainly thorough in his research, extending it often beyond the middle ages, such as his riveting interview with a woman in Czechoslovakia who was ordained as a priest as a way of getting around Communist restrictions against the Catholic Church.  There will be more than enough history to please the history buffs but the story, mainly due to the style of the author, will be a joy for anyone to indulge a couple of hours soaking into this unusual legend of this remarkable, possibly real, woman. It is history as journalism by way of a detective story.	2001-10-01

Robinson's Wild Beasts and Idle Humours (The Insanity Defense from Antiquity to the Present) sounds and looks more fun than it actually will be for the average reader without a sure grounding in legal, philosophical and psychological theory and history.  The author does indeed cover the period from antiquity to the present, as per the sub-title, and provides many interesting ideas along the way, taking a rather conservative approach, but there are also many cases and people just dropped into the book without any explanation on the assumption that the reader will be familiar with all of these legal cases and philosophers from the past two centuries.  A grounding in classical and medieval history (with luck I did have that) will help the reader manage the first part of the book.  For students of legal history, this book could prove quite interesting and, perhaps, invaluable as the author makes a clever attempt to bring ideas of insanity as far back as the writings of Homer and Hesiod.  For this poor soul, the book was a struggle with a few rewards along the way.	2001-09-29

This is pop history at its finest.  There is no delving into the philosophical or religious doctrine behing the crusade against the Cathars on any deep level but those books already exist.  The purpose of this book, and it achieves its goal admirably, is to race the reader through this terrible time letting the urgency of the narrative and the colourful cast of characters carry all the weight.  Thought provoking analysis be damned, this is a rollicking and sad story told very well.  As an introduction or a refresher to this time in Medieval Languedoc, this book is ideal and will be a true treasure to those unfamiliar with this event and who love history.	2001-09-27

The novel looks at the plague in England from the perspective (based on truth) of a town that closed itself off from the outside world so as not to spread the disease that reaches their town early in the plague and early in the novel.  The novel whizzes by quickly and easily, the interest maintained both by the horrific events and the fascinating cast of characters.  The narrator's voice may appear a little too anachronistic at times with the prescience of knowledge only learned much later in the scientific world but the voice of this narrator Anna Frith strikes the right balance generally between sounding of a particular time and being easily understood by the reader.  This is a quick easy read that should be a joy for fans of English history or those seeking a gruesome, yet enjoyable, tale.	2001-09-25

Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz on Stage and Screen to 1939) is an amazingly well researched and thorough piece of work by archivist Mark Evan Swartz.  This piercing view is directed at the 1902-3 stage version and the three subsequent incorporations of the story into the silent movies, often rather loosely incorporated in odd and often surprising ways for those familiar only with the book.  All of these versions of Baum's first book have fallen out of public consciousness, pushed aside, as it were, by the memorable 1939 film verion (the version that remained the truest to the spirit and not just some of the ideas of the book).  Concepts from the previous incarnations do leak into the 1939 movie and it is fascinating to watch this evolution.  This is a tremondous piece of research that is a must for fans of Oz.	2001-09-23

Wrong takes the story into the present by covering the recent years in the Congo after the Belgians abruptly leave their colony, after providing a brief, succint look at its colonial background, to show the rise and fall of Mobutu Sese Seko, taking down the rich natural resources and the economy of his country with him through his time in government.  The author is very effective at showing the Congo as a piece on the Cold War checkerboard using this position to gain support from the United States and money from the IMF and the World Bank allowing a corrupt system to remain in place and the corruption to grow to enormous scale.  The complete absurdity of this situation is made quite clear in the journalistic approach the author takes to this book.  The end of the Cold War ended this system and helped bring down Mobutu, too late to help his country.  The author is quite good at placing the blame and the Western nations come in for their fair share as colonialism left the Congo only to be replaced by a Western backed form of economic imperialism.  A horrifying and often sadly humourous read that opens one's eyes to the situation in Africa.	2001-09-21

It does not quite live up to this title (how could it?) but it does hit the highlights of the life of William Smith, an important and influential progenitor of modern geology.  And what a life, with its great swings of success and failure, betrayal and loyalty, and moments of class warfare.  The story is told well by the author although he emphasizes the importance of Smith too frequently instead of letting the reader understand that through the story itself and he minimizes discoveries on the continent that were leading in similar directions as William Smith.  Still, all in all, a quick, interesting read.	2001-09-18

He writes beautifully of the transformation of little Chiyo into the geisha Suyari (both the changes inside her but also, important for a geisha, the outward changes required of her) and introduces the reader into an exotic, new world along with the young protaganist.  The majority of the novel is this story of becoming a geisha and that is the part of this book that is so magical.  The cast of supporting characters (geisha and their clients) is wonderful.  The book picks up speed with the World Wars and falters a little with the somewhat forced ending but the magic of the bulk of the book before all of this will carry the reader joyously over anything.  This was a marvelous and knowing novel that will transport the reader.	2001-09-15

This section of the book is fascinating but the real meat is the story of Schliemann himself.  The author can be a bit of an apologist for Schliemann but considering the vitriol that has been heaped on him in his own time and the following decades, a little defense is not inappropriate.  The story is well told and quite exciting.  Schliemann may be a hard subject to like but he is always fascinating to read about and this book tells his story very well.  A short, interesting read for those with any interest in the peculiarities of nineteenth century archeology.	2001-09-13

The first half shows some promise, despite the over use of gross out over suspense as a way to hook the reader, but then the whole novel deteriorates into a very long chase sequence with little surprise or heft. There are some very clever ideas about memory and childhood stuck in along the way and the time spent inside the mind of one of the characters is time well spent but these interesting bits are plugged into a story that should have been better. The novel does its best to create proverbial mountians out of molehills but never quite succeeds.	2001-09-05

That said, the book is quite entertaining as it pieces together the story of Martin Frobisher and his ill-fated Elizabethean Arctic adventures and the always fascinating Charles Francis Hall's discovery of the location of Frobisher's Meta Incognita in the nineteenth century. (For a wonderful and full account of Hall, see the very fine Weird and Tragic Shores by C. Chauncey Loomis).  The two stories blend fairly well and the author keeps the narrative sparkling along at an entertaining clip.  This was a good Arctic read for those addicted to these books and a good place to begin for someone who wants to learn what the addiction to these Arctic books is all about from a book that shows men whose addiction to that cold world ran so much deeper than merely reading about it.	2001-09-03

It is a well written book that becomes very difficult to read as it progresses and the endless horrors and atrocities continue unabated. As it is narrated by such a powerful character who is presented from the first as evil (mixed with cowardice, a dealy combination) and without any moral compass, the novel does not develop the horrors slowly but simply presents them one after another after another leaving the reader numb. The author is skilled at this piling on of horrors and creates moments of surprise throughout although finding a meaning to all of this terror seems rather futile. This book never reaches the level of Lord of the Flies but is nastily effective, in its own right, at relentlessly showing man's baser nature.	2001-08-28

The author has picked two fascinating medieval heroes at the pivotal moments in their career and, from there, the story almost writes itself. The abundant use of Moslem sources makes this book a refreshing and different read from other accounts of the various Crusades available. The most interesting fact to learn for this reader is just how little both sides understood about the other, particulary the Crusaders charging in from the West in search of glory. It would have been helpful if the author had been a little more skeptical in treating the comtemporary accounts but he was not writing as an historian so he could pick and choose among the various sources those which would move the story along and provide the most interesting details. It is a good book that will probably frustrate the historian but will be a pleasure for the those seeking an historical adventure.	2001-08-27

It tells the story of the Franklin expedition, from the useful device of a fictonal boy on board who grows into a man during the disastrous trip, and the it is also the story of people obesses with the Franklin expedition, including two half-brothers, both in danger of never growing up in their very different ways, one physically and one emotionally, and the women who connect them both.  The book does have an emotional impact but the writing, at times, lets the story down.  Some of the characters, particulary the grown son and his mother (the truly evil and selfish first wife) seem half drawn.  The Franklin expedition sequences are quite exciting and the author keeps both stories moving swiftly and effectively along.  For many, this book will prove a cool read in the summer sun.  For me, the entire book did not live up to the promise of the best parts of the novel.	2001-08-22

The tale will travel through the dark streets filled with shrieks as a stalker prowls along cutting both women's garments and flesh into the taverns where the Monster hunters gather and to the Old Bailey and the somewhat farcical trials of young Rhynwick Williams.  The author keeps the story moving along at a brisk pace while yet still creating more than sufficient atmosphere for the reader almost to taste the London fog in the air while reading.  In the last chapters he helpfully expands the scope of the book to give the reader a broader perspective on the case.  A very entertaining and informative read to be saved especially for the history buffs when the nights grow a little longer and the wind howls just a little louder.	2001-08-21

It first catches the reader's attention with its exotic premise of a Chinese prisoner in a Tibetan prison camp asked to solve a murder (body found without its head) by the Communist Chinese officials who have imprisoned him.  He is the perfect character to help the reader journey through this novel as he is between worlds himself as a student of Tibetan spirituality through his experience in the camp and as a former official in the Communist government which now persecutes him.  One of the joys of this novel is how many of the character, particulary this prisoner and his two marvelously drawn assistants, will grow and change through contact with each other.  It creates a very palpable emotional wallop by the end of the book.  But mystery fans need not fear that all of this rich cultural tapestry overshadows the mystery.  The author is very skilled at teasing the mystery and tension out of the situation.  There are clues a-plenty and nothing is ever quite what it seems and the story moves easily from moody chills to action thrills without breaking a sweat.  An impressive job that makes this reader anxious to read further mysterys by this talented author.	2001-08-17

It is basically the story of the development of American philosophy from the Civil War unitl the 1920's (with that mode of thinking existing until swept away in the Cold War).  The author has managed to create an exciting read and mixes up the personal, philosophical and poltical throughout the book in such a way to show that there truly is no separation.  The story takes in many of the personalities both before the Civil War (such as the excellent chapter on Louis Agassiz) and after (Jane Addams) to give a broad perspective on the vast changes wrought by the war.  Even if the philosophy gets a little too heavy (and it rarely does), the story never lets the reader down as a parade of fascinating personalities is continually moving through the pages.  This is a vast achievement that is handled with great skill and will be a joy for any reader of history.  What a pleasure to discover that the history of ideas is even more exciting than one would at first imagine in the hands of such a skilled author.	2001-08-16

She truly does capture the feel of a Britsh Victorian novel.  Setting this novel in the closing decade of the nineteenth century, the Gilded Age, may have been a mistake as the heroine does not feel in any way connected to that gilded time and the novel itself nevers points forward with any strength of purpose into the twentienth century.  It seems to be looking backward into the ghosts of the past.  The author handles the switches in the novel from the diary of one character back into the narrative voice of the lead character and back again quite adroitly.  I was ultimately most dissappointed with the ending when the drama slid at times into a rather turgid melodrama.  The atmosphere had the right touch of romance and mystery but the story itself was not always as effective.	2001-08-09

This woman relied on her voice for her wit and her power and the author does a very good job of looking at the effect and originality of this voice in the beginning of the book.  The text can veer into over-analyzing at times, particulary in the chapters devoted to just one movie, but that is part of the charm of a film studies book.  It will make one look a little longer and lot more carefully at these comic screen gems in the future.  Anyone interested in screwball comedy will enjoy this book whether they agree with all the conclusions or not. The text may get a little bogged with a heavy scholar's hand but the material being studied always helps the lighten the load.  An interesting addition to film studies books.	2001-08-08

The story is spread across a large canvas from Prague to the Antarctica, but mainly set in the heart of wonder itself, New York City from the late thirties to the mid-fifties.  The golden age of the comic book comes alive in this story of Josef Kavalier and Sammy Clay creating their successful stories, particulary the Escapist.  Both of the lead characters have to learn about escape, both literal and figuarative, both of the imagination and the body.  The journey makes for a wonderful, emotional read that deserves all the praise heaped upon it.  The author has created a rich tapestry from the looked-down art form of comics and used it to create a time and place that is specific but will still resonate with all readers.  A true joy to read and highly recommended.	2001-08-01

What a pleasure to soak into this book a little every night before crawling into bed as my dreams could then be populated by giant puppets, a little doll town and severl versions of monsters (usually shaped, like many of the aliens encountered, as some form of lizardy thing).  The trouble for the intrpid team seems to orginate often when the Legion rejects a candidate for membership (begging the question of how a team that accepted Bouncing Boy and his super bouncing power and Triplicate Girl with her amazing ability to become three equally useless and identical people instead of simply one can have any criteria for rejecting anyone?).  This volume also includes appearances by Supergirl, Jimmy Olsen (as the purple-clothed Elastic Lad) and for high camp charm, the Legion of Super-Pets.  The art is appropriate to the stories without dazzling but the real charm is in the unintended (perhaps) smiles the reader will wear entering this romp in the future with some very priceless dialogue by Edmond Hamilton.	2001-07-31

This book covers some similar territory seen in the previous volumes by the author, The Six Wives of Henry VIII and the Children of Henry VIII, but this one will give the reader a more focused look at the moving force behind these previous books.  This particular book is much the same in structure as The Life of Elizabeth I, with each chapter looking at specific subjects until the historical narrative finally begins.  The endless stream of descriptions of houses and castles can grow a little wearisome but the completeness will be welcomed by some readers.  Another nice addition to the Tudor library built up by Alison Weir to help fill in the gaps in the previous volumes.	2001-07-29

Kurtz is a powerful creation that lasts because he is both so frighteningly unreal as he grows in Marlow's imagination but, in the end, too devastingly real as a product of the horrors around him.  The territory surrounding the Congo river was truly as horrible as anything brought forth in this novel and reading Adam Hochschild's history, King Leopold's Ghost, along with this book by Joseph Conrad will give the reader a powerful view of the effects of colonization on the continent of Africa.  A terrifying journey down the Congo that is important to take.	2001-07-27

That is a good thing as it allows new readers to discover introverted Gene and that kooky handsome, athletic Phineas and watch their friendship change as the war throws its own shadows on them.  I first read this as a teenager myself and loved it.  Having re-read it since then I discovered deeper meanings but the first impact was so strong and pure (much like Catcher in the Rye read in the one's early years) that it is definately a book to discover in the first pangs of adolescence.  There are many ways of reading this novel but that first purely emotional one is the strongest.  A great book.	2001-07-26

The story is basic with no supernatural add-ons.  It is about a crazed dog and a mother and son trapped in a car and, in the hands of the master, this makes for nail-biting suspense.  It never has the feel of an elongated and needlessly stuffed short story (such as Pet Semetary or The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon) but is a meaty read all on its own.  My only regret is that a friend decided to tell me the ending.  He won't bother us anymore.  An exciting, well-crafted book.	2001-07-25

Jason Todd's Robin was a small blip and is most interesting and important for this series of four issues which chronicle his very bloody death.  It certainly is not the best writing by Jim Starlin but the appearance by Superman later helps and the idea of the Joker becoming the ambassador of Iran is so ridiculous it almost works.  Jim Aparo puts in adequate drawings, down a notch from his best work in the early Brave and Bold, and still seeming a little downtown Neal Adamish.  These issues still have power in their killing of Robin, years later still a shocking scene.	2001-07-24

Rowling's first book in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, hardly needs any more praise but I may as well add my voice to the throng.  This book may lack some of the emotional interplay and complexity of the later volumes but all of the mystery and imagination that went into forming this series are clearly in evidence even with this first volume in this remarkable reading experience.  The author does a marvelous job of balancing the exposition with the adventure, with always a hint or more of mystery thrown in, right from the first few chapters.  The most enjoyable aspect of the series is the way the author has been able to maintain it strengths throughout every volume and that is largely because the series was set on such a firm base as this first book has turned out to have become.	2001-07-23

The lead character is the wonderful creation Joe Keith, a sixteen year old fiercely homosexual and pleasure diving kid.  He is the perfect guide to lead the reader through New Orleans (which can be even more decadent than portrayed here, if the reader can believe that is even possible).

These essays are hit and miss but there are enough little bits of interest to keep most of the readers happy and lead them successfully through the collection.  It is very anecdotal and no conclusions can be truly be drawn from this book but it is successful in showing the diversity that existed in gay America and has only continued to grow since this book.  It is not an important read but can be, at times, an interesting one.	2001-07-21

Everyone and everything of importance in the last century becomes a part of the mix without ever clogging the story, which remains clearly focused with the clever use of the fictional creations.  This book is an epic that truly deserves that title and it will give the reader many hours to reading pleasure.  A wonderful reading experience.	2001-07-20

Douglas has accomplished a major feat in Where the Girls Are (Growing Up Female with the Mass Media) in creating a work that is intelligent and scholarly and insightful, while always being great fun and very entertaining.  Her observations on television shows and pop songs are surprising and will make you look at various aspects of the past pop culture in a new way.  It was wonderful to see the Shirelles and certain television sitcom sixties genies and witches as important and subversive.  This book is well written and the author makes all of her points convincingly and she will have you on her side as she begings to discuss the more serious matters later in the book.

First of all, this book is funny but it is also, often, bitter in an angry urban way that can remind one of a downtown Dorothy Parker.  But, to repeat, it is funny.  She does not tackle any surprising issues, instead sticking to family, the battle between the sexes, feminism and L.A. (as only a New Yorker truly can) but she handles them with fresh insights and, once again, humour.  A nice collection of pieces.	2001-07-18

Through this series he has weaved adventure, religion, fantasy, philosophy, action and many other elements to create a truly unique storyline.  Some of the elements do not blend easily and it is in the second volume that everything comes together with the greatest ease and effect.  This final volume is a little philosophy and exposition heavy at times and it can said that the ending for some of the characters is anti-climatic as loose ends are quickly tied up.  But these are minor quibbles compared to some of the thrills in this third volume, such as the horrifying Land of the Dead and the Gallivespians.  This is a book that will upset many people with inflexible, conservative religious viewpoints but it will be a joy and a challenge to anyone with an imagination.  The journey is exciting and the lessons are profound.  This is the birth of new children's classic.	2001-07-17

It feaures the X-Men, X-Factor and X-Force (given a little too short shrift in this sequence) and focuses on the Cable/Stryfe/Jean Grey/Scott Summers element from the wicked web that has become the X-Men's history.  I enjoyed the interplay of all the characters and was carried along quickly by the story despite a little impatience with both Cable and Stryfe as characters and bitter enemies.  The best parts of the story were the smaller elements like a first glimpse into the techno-virus and the wonderful and revealing look into the relationship betweeen Apocalpyse and Angel.  The art (by Brandon Peterson, Jae Lee, Andy Kubert, and Greg Capullo) also has stood the test of time relatively well.  A fine X-Man adventure.	2001-07-16

Jackson is visiting his aunt Sarah in wonderfully mysterious and ancient Stonehenge, the perfect setting for the adventure to follow.  The creepiness in the story even extends to the girl Jackson befriends who, of course, is the daughter of a gravedigger. The terror is notched a couple of levels from some of Paul Zindel's previous books as the bodies begin dropping.  He has written a fast-paced tale that moves quickly and manages to cover a lot of thrills in a very short space.  A fine little read.	2001-07-16

Mark Waid takes the DC heroes into the future and using Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman on one side and a wonderfully inspired and frightening Captain Marvel (plus a slew of current heroes' children thrown in on both sides) on the other side, he shows both the idealistic and the simple fascistic elements that go into creating a super hero.  The story is marvelously drawn by Alex Ross with paintings that render beautifully some very horrific scenes.  Unlike many such ventures, the story is not cold but told with a great deal of heart.  A wonderful glimpse into a future of the DC heroes.	2001-07-14

This epic (734 pages and nary a wasted word) by author J. K. Rowling achieves the almost impossible task of living up to the hype.  There have been complaints about the violence in this particular volume but it is handled with skill and is a necessary element as the evil lurking throughout the series becomes more palpably real and physical with this story and the results are appropriately terrifying.  This is a book to be devoured a number of times until the fifth in this exciting series makes its appearance.  I have gushed enough, read it.	2001-07-14

Taylor's Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry is a beautifully told tale spoken with the fine voice of its young narrator, Cassie Logan.  It is the story of the Logan family and their struggle to maintain both their small piece of land and their dignity in one tumultuous year, two things not permitted a black family in Mississippi in the early decaces of this century.  The author brilliantly captures the times of which she writes but, even more important, captures the people she writes about.  There are not characters here who can be simply called victims or survivors or fighters or any other single term.  These are fully developed personalities, particulary the children, that speak with authentic and complicated voices and spool out a tale that is heart breaking with equal parts despair and hope.  A wonderful book for children.	2001-07-14

It is not a definitive look at comics but it is an interesting examination of culture that will take the reader on a tour through much of the changes in comic books and society since the thirties using the books themselves as a form of primary evidence.  It brilliantly continues the work of William W. Savage, Jr. in his pioneering Comic Books and American, 1945 - 1954.  This book will be loved by comic book fans, of course, but should also prove quite interesting to any reader interested in matters of popular culture.  It is the right balance between scholarly and fun and is a joy to read.	2001-07-13

K. Rowling builds delightfully on the promise of the first two and sets the scene nicely for the fourth adventure.  The usual themes of whimsical invention and things not being what they appear are carried over but now there is a deepening sense of terror, such as added by the quite frightful Dementors, with a richer emotional tapestry as the lives of Harry Potter's deceased parents is explored.  The series only grows richer with each volume but without losing any of the initial charm that made it a hit in the first place.  This balancing act is the true achievment of the series and the author looks set on continuing this throughout this entire wonderful sequence of adventures.	2001-07-12

Rowling's Harry Potter picks up steam with the second volume in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  The number of characters increase with the delightful addition of Ginny Weasly, Dobby, and Gildefroy Lockhart (not always a successful creation) and the elements of mystery have also increased noticeably over the first Harry Potter adventure.  The volume becomes more of an actual series with this story as all the elements build to a climax that leaves much to be explored in the future volumes.  The excitement and inventiveness of the series deserve their praise and popularity and this is the volume that kicks the experience into high gear.	2001-07-11

This book addresses both the pleasure and pain of having the freedom of choice in society and society's constant need to force people to conform.  It has shades of 1984 and, especially, Brave New World but has much that feels new and potent.  The main hero, Jonas, is a marvelous creation and captures the reader from the start and carries them through to the exciting climax of the book.  This book will live on and will be endlessly debated by children for decades to come and will remain in the memory of every adult who ventured down this terrifying path in their childhood.	2001-07-10

Lees, is, like many collections of essays by different scholars, something of mixed bag.  The very broad topic makes this more evident than usual in this particular volume.  The essays take the tools of feminist criticism and focus it instead on the men.  It may be in literature, such as Beowulf, Castilian ballads or the fables of Marie de France, or in such topics as matrimony in medieval Italy.  The essays vary in quality and the all suffer a little from taking a large topic and distilling it into a few pages which may leave a reader either confused or overwhelmed.  Each of the scholars takes a different perspective on the topic as well with some essays seemingly barely related to the subject.  Some of the pieces are of definate interest and this book, hopefully, will launch more fully developed research into this potentially important arena.	2001-07-09

It is the first and the best of its series and is delightful fantasy of the hightest order.  I was delighted to learn that reading it again as an adult, it still had the power to move and amuse in equal order.  The author's power of imagination is still quite noticeable as each chapter becomes a little stranger than the last.  The book has also lasted because, like any most classics, it does not speak down to children and accepts their ability to absorb much and understand more.  It is, though, more religious than I remembered, at times threatening to engulf the fantasy but never quite doing so.  This is a book that has earned its beloved status and is still a joy.	2001-07-06

The author does an effective job at combining these elements.  The true joy in the novel, though, comes in the creation of the lead character and his friend, Lymie, the two oddballs at their school.  These two characters will pull the reader through the book and allow any reader to identfy with them and their struggles both at school and in solving the mystery, the flip side of those darned popular Hardy Boys.  Everyone has felt the oddball in school and these characters are both outsiders in the system in school and representative of a typical early teenager.  A neat trick for the author to pull off.  A very good first novel by the author for kids.	2001-07-05

It is the story of Liam and his father who had secrets and now has AIDS.  It could be their last chance to repair any damage done to their relationship.  It is a short little book for teenagers but it packs quite an emotional wallop but in a sweetly subtle and quiet manner.  This book will be a nice revelation for any teenager dealing with relationship issues with their parents.  It is a look at dealing honestly with one's parents and one's children and building a relationship through that honesty whatever it reveals.  It is a sad, touching story.	2001-07-04

This book is much more focused than the previous work (and perhaps not quite as much fun) as it looks at the screen work and personal lives of six women of noir, Jane Greer, Audrey Totter, Marie Windsor, Evelyn Keyes (my personal favourite for the totality of her marvelous life), Coleen Gray, and Ann Savage.  The book is divided in two parts.  The first part looks at the period of their noir work and the second part looks at their lives afterwards, right to the present.  One should not look for a theme in the lives of these women and, instead, one should look at how individual each of these women are despite playing similar femme fatales (with exception of good girl, Coleen Gray) on the screen.  This is a lovely tribute to these women and all the others who created that dark magic so long ago.  The author did a fantastic job with his noirish prose making these women as interesting as people as they were as mysterious as screen characters.	2001-07-03

The influence of E. Nesbit is unmistakable in the structure of the book but with a much lighter touch and purpose.  This is not high fantasy but it delighted me as a child on a summer day sitting in the grass and sending me soaring away on a cloud of adventure.  The idea of getting half a wish is an inspired concept and this idea is not let down by the author as he puts it to magical and imaginative use throughout the work.  His work as a lyricist serves him well in the writing as some passages feel like light verse.  A wonderful book.	2001-07-02

I originally read it in the seventies and was thrilled with it and became a fan of Lois Duncan and have since read it in the wake of seeing the movie and the book still holds up in the category of suspense.  The lead character is well developed and very strongly written while the supporting characters add nice window dressing to the whole endeavor.  People expecting the horror, gore, and death toll of the movie will be dissappointed.  This is teen suspense of the old school variety.	2001-07-01

I owned the entire series as a child (and was very proud of this achievment) so it was interesting to re-read the first one I ever bought and read.  The Secret of Wildcat Swamp is still a straight forward read that makes up in memories what it lacks in substance.  It is,though, an exciting adventure story for kids with the usual roster of bad guys, chums, mystery and danger.  The first three in the series are the strongest but this particular volume is one of the strongest of the later adventures.  It is nice to spend a few hours of the day soaked in my past and a dangerous swamp with those intrepid Hardy kids.	2001-06-30

It is a nice way to visit Oz beginning with the excellent essay, notes and bibliography by Jack Zipes to set the reader on the right foot along the Yellow Brick Road.  After that the stories themselves will delight the reader in their own way with the versatile imagination of the author and will hopefully lead the unintiated to read more about Oz and to the more seasoned explorers it will bring back the joy felt when first going to this wonderful, wonderful land.

Dick as this is, thus far, the only one of his novels I have read.  But based on a reading of The Game-Players of Titan, it will not be the last.  The premise of the inhabitants of Earth playing the game, Bluff, for spouses and land is wonderful and the story only grows weirder and more original with each passing chapter.  The only small quibble is the ending is somewhat anti-climatic after the strongly built, witty, creatively heightened build up but this book is about the journey and one could have no better guide than the author for this unique trip.	2001-06-28

The lead character, nine-year-old Trisha McFarland, has to survive in the woods listening to broadcasts of Boston Red Sox games and (perhaps) stalked by some mysterious creature.  The nature survival bits were more interesting than the stalker.  The author batters the girl up in his usual fashion and pushes her to the edge, figuratively and in reality, but still something is missing.  There is not enough material to sustain the two hundred plus pages (a very small novel for Mr. King) and it would have made a tight, thrilling short story instead.  A quick read but not nearly as engaging as the author's usual efforts.	2001-06-27

For such a long book taking place in a single weekend, the plotting is wonderfully tight and efficient and designed for major thrills.  The action begins immediately and never lets up.  All of his favourite character types are there and he shows great pleasure in mixing them up (and also beating them up).  King's horrors are the most fun with many different personalities showing the story from different vantage points.  The classic and still the best King, 'Salem's Lot, is the best example of this and Desperation is a notable addition.  Sadly, the Richard Bachman book, The Regulators, issued as a odd companion piece to Desperation is quite weak.  For an exciting page turner, Desperation can not be be beaten.	2001-06-26

The author spends a lot of time trying to create the feel of the times, sometimes with success, as a way to pad out a rather flimsy tale.  The story does pick up a strong narrative thrust during the episode at Matawan and the author handles this material especially well.  It is worth reading through much of the rest of the account to come to this very satifyingly drawn episode that captures both the period and the drama with equal aplomb.  The author has done much research and should have felt comfortable sharing a little more with the reader, such as accounts of unconfirmed shark attacks in America before this time, a history of sea wrecks on the Jersey coast, and more of the scientific debate on sharks over the past century, to set more of a historical context grounded in the ocean, instead of such things as the life of a doctor in Philadelphia at this period.  Still, it is the perfect short read for the beach as the weather gets hotter and large shadows can be seen far off in the water.	2001-06-25

Sir Henry Marrivale is the sleuth and he is, as always, a dependable joy.  The author has surrounded him with an able cast of supporting characters to help nudge the story along.  The triumph, of course, and the reason for this book's existence is the locked room crime.  Carter Dickson knows how to tease the mystery and drama out of this glorious cliche, making it seem fresh and new.  This is a classic from a thrilling time in mystery writing by a true master of the form.  Not to be missed.	2001-06-24

Houston novel, Snow Mountain Passage, has two main threads.  The minor one is the recollections of an eighty year survivor of the Donner Party looking back to her time as an eight year old during the struggle for survival.  The major storyline, though, is that of her father, James Frazier Reed, and his search for a rescue party for his lost family and the other emigrants as he gets caught up in the politics and struggles of a new territory being born.  The problem with the book is that the more interesting story (and better writing) lie with the Donner Party and the interesting clash of personalities there.  Unfortunately, the reader has to go through much less developed or lively personalities, such as Reed himself, to get back to the heart of the story.  The tragedy of the Donners hangs over the entire novel but is not enough to carry it through the less interesting or illuminating sections.	2001-06-23

It is not exactly a sequel but it does loosely form the middle in a semi-autobiographical trilogy (between A Boy's Own Story and A Farewll Symphony).  All can be read and enjoyed on their own but also fit together smoothly to take the reader through different times in the life of a gay man.  This volume takes the reader from the repressive fifties into the time of Stonewall as the main character grows from a young man in the midwestern college into a gay urbanite going to the gym.  The growth of the narrator is more honest and well written than in many gay novels and will resonate with the reader with painful or humourous , at different times, recognition whether he grew up in that era or not.  It is a fine novel that plays all the right notes.	2001-06-22

Zobel's The Boston Massacre has, for a few decades, been available as an example of American history as opposed to American mythology.  The author is clear about the misrepresentations on both sides of the tension but it is his look at the ways in which the radicals controlled the town, the politics and the media through the use of the mob and terror tactics that is refreshing.  Boston merchants and politicos, such as Samuel Adams, manipulated a situation for their own ends and began writing their own version right from the start.  After the success of the American Revolution , this version would be enshrined as official history.  The book starts slow and is a little dry and often confusing for those with with little previous knowledge of pre-Revolutionary Boston politics but it picks up speed and energy as it races toward the day of the Massacre itself. A refreshing look at an event that was small in historical impact but large in legend.	2001-06-21

It tells the story of several trips down the Yellow Brick Road from the tale of the abused orphan, Dorothy Gael, in nineteenth century Kansas to Judy Garland making a movie of a life little Dorothy never had to Jonathan, dying of AIDS, returning to Kansas and his belief in Oz.  All of these stories speak the truth about fantasy (if such a thing is possible) and the power of these other worlds to sustain, taunt, and guide us, particulary in childhood.  There are many themes throughout this tangled and deliciously written narrative and it will touch any reader who has every felt the power of escape take hold of them as a child and whisk them away for just a little while, like Dorothy in the cyclone.  A touching, beautiful tale that easily ranks in my eternal top ten.  A book to be treasured and re-read over the years.	2001-06-20

She earns the pleasurable feelings from her readers through the creation of her dazzling cast of characters and spinning them through a marvelous narrative.  I laughed and I cried and sometimes often at the same time.  The author writes beautifully and easily allows the reader to soak into the Southern pool of charm she creates.  I have enjoyed many of her novels but this is the one that always draws me back.  It is the perfect novel for a summer day sipping a mint julep and wondering how eccentric your friends and neighbours could be if only they were Southern.	2001-06-18

The story is told from many, many different vantage points as each snippet of a section focuses on a different personality in the town, actually two towns, one black and one white, with many secrets.  It is all of these supporting characters that will carry the reader throught the myriad strands of the plot.  It is wonderful that the author has been ablet to use his accomplished skill in the short story and transferred it to this epic novel. Like his short stories, much will be left unexplained and that will frustrate many readers but this is not a book about solutions (although there are some) but about crossing boundaries (and there is much of that).  It is a wonderful book about America, all of America, the real America.	2001-06-18

The author manages, for the most part, to effectively capture different generations (perhaps weakest on the youngest generation) far more than most writers in the gay field.  I do not know that it was necessary for them all to be so specatular looking (or at least to their physical beauty to be referred to so often as a part of the narrative).  It is the writing, though, that, in the end, will carry the reader through the lives of these four men as they examine and obscure their past, present and future.  It is a pleasant read with a satisfying ending.	2001-06-18

It was about being different and about surviving.  Like the title suggests, the main character will go through both the good times and the bad times and survive (maybe, just barely) and both types of times were, in the end, okay because it was all a part of life.  This book takes up many of the themes of A Separate Peace and mixes them with a lot more humour and comes a little closer to the truth at times and builds an unforgettable relationship between two boys in a private school and their reaching out to each other to find the things they think they have missing in themselves.  This book states that life will have many suprises.  This is one of the good ones.	2001-06-18

In some ways, it becomes a list of animals that have dissappeared or are on the brink.  It is very depressing but the author presents the facts and arguments in a clear fashion that captures the price of American progess on its wildlife.  Despite some occasional purple prose and the new issues and arguments that have occured since, this is a very good reprint of a classic from the past.	2001-06-17

The strength of this book will always be in the strong, funny, honest, Southern lead character, Molly Bolt.  She is the type of character that will anchor the future books of Rita Mae Brown.  Rubyfruit Jungle does not have the richly drawn supporting characters of the even better Sudden Death and Southern Discomfort or the self assured writing that developed but in this fine first novel are all the beginnings of a dazzling writer who takes the read from silly to touching in the warm breath of a paragraph.  This still should be anyone's first choice to learn as a teenager that being different is not only OK, it is preferred.	2001-06-16

The only problem is that it may be slow reading as you will want to call all your friends after every page to say, &quot;Did you know ...&quot;  (A brief warning:  They will begin to be annoyed if you do this too often but just try and stop yourself).  The book is more than an informal history of the English Language in the United States (as per the subtitle) as it covers all of American history, both political and social, in the author's delightful style.  One story will lead into another and you will have forgotten where you began but the ride will always be worth it.  Before your very eyes he will dispel many of the myths of America and build up America with some solid truths.  An wonderfully funny and smart work.	2001-06-14

He becomes deeply involved in scandal and murder resulting from his horny decision.  The murder myster element is not strong but it is used more as catalyst for the narrator to explore all of his issues about sex, politics, and where and how one takes a personal stand in both arenas.  It is not the author's best work but there is enough of interest to sustain the reader and small moments of insight and beauty.  The quiet, unsettling ending was the set at the perfect pitch.

It has the excitement of the first book with the added addition of layers and layers of complicated and intriguing ideas sprinkled throughout.  It is hard to remember one is reading a book meant for children but then the reader must just remember that this is because the author respects the intelligence of children and it shows in his writing.  The intense religiosity and philosophy of the book can be a little daunting at first but then when the ideas and characters begin being moved around like chess pieces it is a wonder to behold.  It is hard to imagine how the author can sustain the intensity in the final volume but it will be a joy to find out.  This entire book is about quests as all the many (well-developed) characters begin seeminly different quests that end up in the same place.  The first book was Lyra's quest, this volume expands the story to epic proportions.  An amazing read.	2001-06-11

It has the erotic charge and the creepy paranoid (with good reason) fear mixed in equal measures to make this novel feel vivid and authentic. The unnamed lead chararcter takes the reader through his encounters and furtive loves through the decades to when he writes it all down in 1956 in a very compulsive manner that is sad and lonely with the thin shadows of anger, rebellion and triumph creeping in on the edges.  It is an evocative look at a time but also a look at a time about to change.  A very knowing, readable novel.	2001-06-09

This reader can sometimes get a little lost in the details of battles but the author is quite able at making these skirmishes clear and understandable (even if my head did swim a little still).  The book covers more than battles, though, as personalities and politics become an important part of the mixture and the author clearly presents the impact of the evetns on the countries participating.  The author is a historian with an edge and the skill to get away with it.  This books should be enjoyed by anyone who wants to learn about this horrific war or those who want a fresh look at old arguments.  A marvelous read.	2001-06-09

In this case it is the people living in small town Tennesse, particulary three very different sisters, Jo-Nell, Eleanor and Freddie, along with their grandmother, Minerva Pray.  In Amercian Pie, Michael Lee West makes these women both bigger than life and true to life in a wonderful alchemy of words and Southern charm.  It is a book that is filled more with joy than sadness, although there are heaping portions of both, and it is a book about various ways of running away from yourself and, even better, various ways of coming back to yourself.  A wonderful read.	2001-06-07

The author peoples the book with vivid characters caught in a struggle for survival within a family that is of the take-no-prisoners variety that in lesser hands would come off as simply melodramatic but Su Tong is an inventive and skilled storyteller who layers the narrative and events to create a small epic.  Hunger pervades all the actions of the book, whether for rice or sex or revenge (and sometimes all three), as a symbol for this turning point in Chinese history before the Communist take over.  This is a short exciting literary ride that will reward any reader brave and lucky enough to begin the journey.	2001-06-06

The proof is Suicide Blonde, a dark trip through the sexual underbelly of a town as Jesse follows her boyfriend, Bell, and discovers much about herself....  It is almost structured as a series of short stories.  The weakness of the book is the lack of connection with any of the characters for this reader, except perhaps at times with Jesse, or the characters to each other keeping the adventures from becoming truly erotic and remaining instead merely sexual.  The fine imagery keeps the story flowing.  It is a fine, quick read and a perceptive look at a different world that, in the end, is not so different.	2001-06-05

It is the essentially the story of two groups of transported (to Australia) political prisoners in the nineteenth centures, the Young Irelanders in 1848 and the Fenians in 1865.  This long book is vividly written to bring to life the careers of these men whose exploits touched the nations of Ireland, England and America, as well as the budding nation states of Canada and Australia.  The only flaw of the book is that it could have done with some shortening of sections, such as the Civil War exploits of Thomas Francis Meagher and the escape of the Fenain soldiers from Australia.  At any rate, the author takes the reader on an expansive adventurous journey through a people's struggle and their tragic century of protest.  It is fascinating to watch each of the men (and one notable woman, Eva of the Nation) adapt to whichever country they adopt and fight and, sometimes, die for their new nation, Irish rebellion transformed into a universal form of idealism and heroism.  A truly monumental work.	2001-06-04

It is a twist off of King Lear set in a farm in Iowa in the seventies.  The thrust of the story is the relationship between the three sisters as they deal with their monster of a father and his decision to give the farm to his three daughters.  There is a little dose of horror every few pages mixed in with marvelous descriptions of domestic housekeeping and farm working.  It is sometimes hard to look at the tragedy directly and the author will often provide the reader with a way of looking at it indirectly where it sort of sneaks up on the reader.  The terrible events these women face grow out of the ordinary things that fill their everyday life until both the ordinary and the terrible blend together.  It is powerful writing that is both subtle and strong.  Not to be missed.	2001-06-03

That is why I was so surprised not to like Duplicate Keys.  The book had my interest at the beginning and developed the lead character Alice Ellis quite well. The idea of a close knit group of friends falling apart and away from each other as some of them grew up was fascinating, particulary as two of them have been shot dead at the beginning of the book.  The mystery element is early on through out, though, as it becomes obvious who it is and the book descends to a sort of psychobabble  for the resoltion that is beneath the subtle display of human motives that the author manipulated beautifully in A Thousand Acres.  This book is an early one for author as she develops her wonderful style and it feels incomplete. But if this is the phase she had to move through to provide the wonderful later, then it was worth it.	2001-06-02

Billy is dead at the beginning of the book and the rest of the novel is narrated by his younger brother Ray and spans four days in actual time and many years in remembered time.  The heart and hope of the story comes in the relationship between Ray and his sister, Jean (a wonderfully unique creation).  This book is often disturbing but it is also quite compelling and there is much hard truth in its pages.	2001-06-01

The delightful combination of art, history, chess and suspense is blended masterfully together in a clever and potent mix that, ultimately, is too rich to be sustained.  The reader will be carried along, particulary anxious to find out how all these elements can come together as it seems beyond belief that there is a coherent purpose behind all of this delightful madness.  The reader would be right as the all the silly psychobabble at the end simply leaves a bitter aftertaste after the sumptuous meal provide for in setting up the situation.	2001-05-31

I became enraptured by the three main characters and fell head long into their lives.  The triangle they form changes all their lives forever and even the resolution is equal parts both satisfying and disturbing because these three people will never be the same.  That is both good and bad as it is the world outside of fiction.  I give the author many points for making me care so much about these people (and even the main couple's children are given marvelous, small places to shine).  The book is smart and very touching without becoming sentimental.  There are no epiphanies only small decisions and deceits that reverberate.  A wonderful read.	2001-05-30

This is an important book for historians of the period as well as an important piece of writing for those who love the fiction and ideas of Orwell as one can easily see their development through his experiences in Spain.  The sections on the fighting in Barcelona between the Anarchists and the Communists (instead of against their true enemy, the Fascicts) as well as the subsequent suppression of the POUM are among the most riveting.  He is always clear about his personal biases and he is not writing as an historian but as an observer who has been betrayed yet is still hopeful.  The flashes of humour are among the many surprises in this very personal account of the devastation of a country and the growth of a writer.	2001-05-29

Jackson's Dilemma is much lighter on philosophy than previous books and is by no means among her stongest (for me, The Unicorn, A Severed Head, The Flight from th Enchanter, but it is hard to select when the picking's are all so ripe).  Despite that it is still a good read, particulary for those readers not familiar with Dame Murdoch, and this could, hopefully, lead these readers further into the treasure trove left behind by the very sad passing of the author. All the basic themes and situations that Dame Murdoch likes to play with are in Jackson's Dilemma, from the the antic comings and goings of friends and lovers to the observer who knows something no one else does know.  A good read.	2001-05-28

It cleverly combines the narrative voices of many characters to create a true portrait of the adventuring and colonizing tendencies of the British and the people they encounter, in this case the aborigines of Tasmania.  Peevay is the Tasmanian who guides us through forty years of colonization leading to the eventual extinction of his people.  The other side of the story is the delightfully colourful smugglers from Manx and the English passengers they, through a series of mishaps, are transporting to Tasmania.  Of the English passengers, the vicar represents the religion and the doctor represents the science of the Victorians and both characters are equal parts humourous and horrifying and, sadly, authentic.  This is a gripping read that tells an important story of a period of time that never forgets it is also an rollicking adventure.	2001-05-27

Stella Raphael, the main character, is slowly entwined into the web of Edgar Stark, a patient at the asylum where her husband works.  The reader will watch (read) in horror as this relationship sends all of the characters spiraling downwards.  It is wonderfully Gothic with a very contemporary feel for the characters.  All of this delicious tension build and grows with restrained ferocity during the novel and this reader found the ending of little release for all that came before it. Still, an interesting and excitingly depressing read.	2001-05-26

It is the story of survival in all senses of that word; physical, emotional, but especially spiritual.  It traces the story of Jews in a forced labour camp and the small child playing the violin who appears to them.  The originality in the characters and the vivid details of the situation sets this book apart from others covering similar material.  It goes beyond merely the sheer horror of the situation and finds the novel's life in the individual characters trapped within that situation.  The story finds its universal message not through a grand design but through finding the uniqueness of the individuals in small, personal ways.  A truly touching work.	2001-05-25

She works at this through the help of many of the colourful characters of the town, particulary some fiesty women such as Sister Thelma Husband (my favourite) and Lexie Coop (with her large brood each named after candy).  There are many setbacks on her upward trajectory but the author and Novalee handle each with heart, which this book is stuffed to the brim with.  A delightful read on a summer's day.	2001-05-24

Having never seen the series I cannot compare the two (although having read the book I would be fascinated how this could possibly have worked on television).  The book has a marvelous introduction (the best part) that looks at the concept of the Middle Ages in today's culture and then follows with a section on cathedral building, the Cathars and St. Francis,  Abelard versus Bernard of Clairvaux, and Dante.  It is a very selective and idiosyncratic look at the middle ages but still quite interesting, both in its selection and its handling of material.	2001-05-23

Jones has written a tight thriller, A Single Shot, that takes the reader deeper and deeper down a dark tunnel of despair and violence.  It begins with a single shot that reverberates in one man's life until the final few pages.  There is no let up from the protaganist's despair and it makes for an exciting and somewhat depressing read.  The author writes well and uses the space of this short novel effectively and chillingly as he shows how a single moment can destroy the destiny of men forever.  It has the feel of the world of film noir mixed with the literary imagingings of mystery novel.	2001-05-22

The narrator, Isabel Walker, will lead the reader through her time in Paris as she visits her step-sister, Roxy and becomes involved in events, both silly and serious, erotic and neurotic.  It is a gentle, funny comedy of clash of manners.  This book recieved much hype when first released and has spawned a new sequel in Le Mariage and while perhaps not quite living up to the hype for this reader, it is still an entertaining and smart novel.  The author has made the experiences of these ex-pats quite believable in sometimes unbelievable circumstances and the story moves along at a swift pace.	2001-05-21

This book (The Catholic Church:  A Short History) will be, in a way, a synthesis of his religious and scholarly work over the past four decades.  It will be neither a Church history written from the viewpoint of the official papal historians nor will it be an anti-Catholic catalogue of crimes throughout time.  The author writes as a Catholic and both his love for his Church as it should be and his frustration with it as it can often be suffuses the entire history.  He covers the material both efficiently and passionately in a short amount of space.  This book may be disliked by those who are either blindly pro-papacy or obstinately anti-Catholic, but everyone else should have an entertaining and informative read from an author who understands history as a lived experience.	2001-05-20

It was the first book I read without stright tthrough with no break as a child and I return to it each year and my love for it only grows deeper.  Merricat Blackwood is a hero for anyone who has felt different (and let's face it, that's everyone) who narrates the story of her sister and herself, the wonderful Cosntance, with humour, heart, and a little bit of magic. The opening paragraph seduced me as a child and its power still holds:            &quot;My name is Mary Katherine Blackwood.  I am eighteen              years old, and I live with my sister Constance.  I              have often thought that with any luck at all I could              have been born a werewolf, because the two middle              fingers on both my hands are the same length, but I              have had to be content with what I had.  I dislike              washing myself, and dogs, and noise.  I like my              sister Constance, and Richard Plantagenet, and              Amanita phalloides, the death-cup mushroom.               Everyone else in my family is dead.&quot; The story is haunting and, ultimatley, sad but the connection the reader will have with these isolated sisters is very strong and makes for a potent reading experience.  Shirly Jackson has created a minor masterpiece that will speak to anyone who likes to read and imagine and does not quite understand a world where those are not the most valued things.	2001-05-19

The fine writing and the strong voice of the narrator will carry the reader along through the story of Edith Goodnough and all her eighty years of hardship, sacrifice and small pleasures.  Edith is a vivid and true creation that seems formed from the earth of the Great Plains itself.  It is hard to believe that this is a first novel and it will certainly lead this reader to other novels by this author.  It is a little depressing as Kent Haruf is superb at capturing the isolation of the prairies but the novel does find a way to squeeze precious drops of joy from the situation.  A fine read.	2001-05-18

The most incredible part is just how successful Anthony Pagden is at synthesizing this great meal of material into a delicious appetizer.  It is a clear, straight forward narrative that interestingly draws a number of important themes through two and a half centuries of European questing.  The philisophical aspects of each of the great empires is the strongest and most important aspect of this work and is handled with great skill.  It is a fine overview of a challenging topic.	2001-05-17

He took the most gossipy tidbits from such classical writers as Tacitus and Suetonius (and there is much to choose from) and formed it into a very readable, much fun account of the early life of the emperor Claudius.  The author's skill was in making this account equally entertaining for the student of classical history and the reader who could not care less for that period of time.  Everyone will be seduced by this murderous and lecherous cast of characters.  It is soap opera on a grand and glorious scale.	2001-05-16

The lives and loves of the rich who belong to the South Fork club(Andrew Carnegie, Andrew Mellon, H. C. Frick) are juxtaposed with the working people of Johnstown in the valley.  Hanging over all of this is the ultimate disaster of the dam burst.  No matter how similar the two groups seem to be in their search and need for love and happiness, in the end the differences are even greater as one group controls the destinies (and the very lives) of the other.  Anyone reading this book for the disaster (the reason I picked it up in the first place) will be somewhat dissappointed but, hopefully, the author's wonderful creating of a context for this time and place will slowly seduce the reader.	2001-05-15

It is amazing to discover how much fun and quirky the book and the characters are and, yet, somehow the writing always reaches deeper just when the reader does not expect it.  The book creates emotion out of chaos and pieces together a novel of the heart that a lesser writer would have made straight forward and  senimental.  The author has simply made it strange turning into unusual turning into delightful turning into moving and then coming back again.  These are characters that are hard to forget, particulary the baby Joan, a truly unique creation.  It is great to find a Canadian author of such talent.	2001-05-14

Acme will not please everyone as the humour is not always accessible but when it clicks, it clicks with a sweet, funny vengence.  I did not understand all the humour but could surprisingly even enjoy the whimsy of the essays that were swimming just a little above my head.  And each small essay is short enough to either get or not get and then move on to the next one.  In a short space of time there should something of great humour for the reader and, often, many things.  Because of the rather esoteric style of the humour, the book even stands up to repeated readings, something that is very rare in a book of humour.	2001-05-13

Elena McMahon does a favour for her father and through that favour and through her we see the large unfathomable world of conspiraces and esponiage boiled to very human elements.  There is a cold spareness to the writing that left this reader unmoved until after it was over and then the sadness powerfully washed over me.  It is an unique and haunting look at the choices people make and the lives and events that one can affect with simple, irrevocable gestures.  A beautiful novel.	2001-05-12

Similar to  Jackson's book, this beautiful little novel is about one person's struggle against a community's narrow mindedness.  The story is told with the author's usual degree of gentle humour over icy emotions, with quirky characters developed in an amazingly crisp and illuminating short hand.  The reader will identify and fall in love with Florence Green, who has the audacity to open up a book shop in a town that does not have one. One cannot help but catch a little of her optimism and this will drag the reader along and down with Florence.  This book is a perfect gem that sparkles and dazzles the reader before it snatches the light away.  Highly recommended.	2001-05-11

This addition to the genre may not be as well written and researched as some (In the Heart of the Sea sets a high standard for going beyond simply the events of the tragedy and taking the reader into the context) but this book makes up for any faults by telling one of the most horrific stories imaginable.  It begins with gross incompetence by the leaders of the expedition and then becomes a story of murder, mutiny, suicide, cannibalism and the very occasional act of heroism.  It is stunning to see a raft (appropriately referred to as a death raft) go from one hundred and fifty to fifteen people in a couple of weeks.  It is a gripping tale for those readers who have developed a taste for these rather gruesomely riveting survival tales.	2001-05-10

The amazingly wonderful thing is how the author is able to adroitly pull all of these threads together to create a marvelous whole.  The tales of prejudice tell a horrifyingly universal story but the individual characters within the stories speak of some hope amidst the anguish.  It is a cleverly crafted work that turns history on its head in showing how times change but human emotions remain steadfastly consistent, both good and bad.  A short, interesting, powerful read.	2001-05-09

Sears, in Controveries and Commanders (Dispatches from the Army of the Potomac), has written a very readable account of the Army of the Potomac through ten specific examinations of controveries surrounding different leaders that cover the entire time span of the Civil War.  He gives enough detail to bring the novice properly into the debate without bogging the narrative down.  The author keeps the stories, combining to form a single tapestry, humming along.  The theme that seems to connect all the various narratives is the idea of jeolousy, betryal, back-biting, and gossip that infected the top ranks of the Army and brought many commanders, whether rightly or wrongly.  The human dimension of the leaders at war could not have been brought into clearer focus.  It was often a little frightening but also made for very interesting reading.  A wonderful book for a Civil War beginner.	2001-05-08

This is an unusual story but it is created and built up in ways that make it believable. No good deed or bad will go unpunished and betrayal is an always quietly lurking shadow among the people.  The relationships are complicated, particulary the child and the man in the box, and the author makes ambiguous all the various choices of the characters.  There is no black or white, good or evil, just people making good and bad decisions, often for very personal and odd reasons.	2001-05-07

Carnes has gathered together an interesting collection of essays written by historians examining works of historical fiction with, often, rebuttal essays by the authors of the books.  I will admit that I have only read three of the novels selected for this collection but that did not stop me from enjoying this book at all and, in fact, has lead me to purchase a couple of the historical novels discussed.  Not all the pieces work effectively.  It is a little awkward having Thomas Fleming discuss his work both as a historian and a writer of fiction and Richard White was too harsh in his assesstment of Annie Dillard.  For all these quibbles, though, this was a fine and interesting exercise and it does make one look at historical fiction in a different way and appreciate the complexity of the form and the energy and skill in producing it.	2001-05-06

The title character, Fludd, arrives in the village of Fetherhoughton and , both subtly and drastically, changes things at a crucial time for the local priest, Father Angwin, and the Catholic Church.  This is background for a wonderfully eccentric group of characters that charm their way through the book.  I initially picked up the book because of an interest in the historical Robert Fludd, the alchemist, but discovered that it was the quirky denizens of this village that captured my heart and were the driving force behind the book.	2001-05-05

The most delightful and charming aspect of Reading in the Dark is the voice of its unnamed narrator as he struggles to understand the world he is growing up in (Northern Ireland in the 1950's).  Every situation can have so many solutions to him, some mundane, most wondrous.  It is surprising how much humour can be found in the life led by this boy, as written by Mr. Deane.  The wit of the writing helps cushion the reader for all the very many sadnesses and horrors which occur throughout the book.  The reader and the narrator will together learn to navigate this world and survive.  An effective and powerful read.	2001-05-04

The debunking may seem to readers to focus on too easy of targets, from crop circles to alien abductions, but the book leads from that in a natural progression to a plea for science being taught and presented in a way that reaches all citizens.  His enthusiasim for science is electric and contagious.  The book is not about attacking (necessarily) other's beliefs but about enriching everyone's beliefs by adding a healthy dose of skepticism attached to a sense of wonder as only science can provide.  A well done job from an author and thinker sorely missed.	2001-05-03

Kertzer has written a wonderful account of a pivotal event in Italian, Jewish and Catholic history.  The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara tells the story of the 1858 kidnapping of a six year old Jewish boy secretly baptized while a baby by a Catholic servant in the home.  From this horrifying personal incident for this Jewish family the panorama of the story grows very large indeed, taking into account the Pope, the governments of Europe, and the forces for the unification of Italy.  The author does a superb job of making all of this understandable to the reader.  He also never allows the epic scope of the book to overwhelm the family as the centre of all of this controversy.  The Mortaras hold a special place in this tragedy as they deserve and the lives lived by Jewish families, such as theirs, in Italy is vividly presented.  It is a shocking book, yet very illuminating and well written.  Highly recommended.	2001-04-28

This is one of the most entertaining of Jonathan D. Spence's many books on China that combines elements of good scholarship, a panorama of a time and place with an exciting story.  The true joy in the story comes from the way each element of it and every discovery leads all the participants from one mystery to another.  The emperor and the traitor are both interesting and well developed throughout the book and it is their dialogue and personalities that forms the basis for this wonderful read.	2001-04-24

It is the perfect book for those interested in a first look at the subject of homosexuality through the ages in European and American culture.  It is neither particulary scholary or exhaustive and while each of the specific topics (such as literature) or eras (such as medieval) is covered more thouroughly elsewhere, this book provides a fascinating glimpse at the horrendous forces at play through homophobia, whether religious, civil or personal, as they have shaped society from ancient Greece to Stonewall.  There are certain gaps, such as the absence of a discussion of Europe during the twentienth century. It is a horrifying glimpse into the history of a destructive mindset and the author handles the subject matter in an illuminating and interesting fashion.	2001-04-22

The author skillfully combines elements from the accounts of two survivors to locate the truth of the tale.  In addition, one will become immeresed in the history of Nantucket, the whaling industry (including graphic accounts of the hunt not for the faint hearted), and other elements of this particular place and time in history.  An exciting read and a fine speciman of that popular creature, the true survival story.  Highly recommended.	2001-04-22

The short chapters detailing each hoax are fascinating and the book is a wonderfully entertaining little read.  Once one reads the first hoax one will be hooked and the rest of the book will quickly cascade from one folly to another.  The author presents each case quite clearly and, though, supporters of various of these explorers, such as Peary and the North Pole, will balk, the average reader will come away with a little wisdom and a touch of cynicism about the great adventure yarns we all grew up learning.  And that can be a good thing.  A delighful little collection of adventures that should lead the reader to other true adventure stories with a greater understanding and appreciation.	2001-04-16

Castaneda has written a well-researched and thorough look at the succession of Mexican presidents from the 1970 to the 1994 election in Perpetuating Power (How Mexican Presidents Were Chosen).  This book is made all the more fascinating as this system no longer holds true in the Mexican system as the essentially one party government (PRI) no longer holds power for the first time since the 1920's.  The author takes the reader through each presidents decision before each election as he selected and annointed his personal choice for his successor in Mexico's system, resembling closely the appointing of  a new dictator every six years as the successor chosen always became the PRI candidate and, thus, the Mexican president.  It is intersting to see the combination of personal, political, business and myriad of smaller factors work to move the winner ahead or pull the losers back.  The series of essays on the successors are followed by a series of interviews with the Mexian presidents, for which the essays nicely prepare the reader.  Some of selection process can become repititious and this book is only for those interested in Mexican politics, particulary with a little previous knowledge, but it is an important subject presented very well.  An invaluable resource for examining relatively recent Mexican politics.	2001-04-09

Cantor, is an interesting hodgepodge of ideas, facts, theories, arugments, humour, and anything else that can be loosely tied (and I mean very loosely) to the Great Pestilence of 1348-50.  It is always a fascinating read but the reader can grow dizzy with the meandering the journey takes.  It is in the style of Barbara Tuchman's A Distant Mirror and William Manchester's A World Lit Only by Fire but does not match the cohesiveness and breadth of those fine books.  In the Wake of the Plague is very useful, though, in its incorporation of all the latest research and theories and the bibliography (as is usual for Mr. Cantor) is fascinating in its own right.  This book is a readable adventure for anyone willing to join the author as he bounces quickly from idea to idea as the middle ages rapidly becomes curiouser and curioser.  This is no academic tome but could possibly interest readers in a very important and entertaining period of history.	2001-04-06

It is an impressive look at economic history for the last three hundred years in order to show that there is nothing deterministic about the apparent success of capitalism and democracy in our time.  This is the most effective aspect of the book as the author makes a clear case for smashing the myth that the &quot;End of History&quot; has been achieved by the double helix of capitilism and democracy.  It is effective in demonstrating the complexity behind the ups and downs in the various fates of countries.  He relies on Britain and America predominantly and they both figure into his concluding discussion of the need for America to become involved in exporting democracy and free markets to &quot;rogue&quot; states (never clearly defined), by military means if necessary.  This somewhat startingly conclusion is too simplistically presented at the end of the book, particularly as the theories and ideas throughout the rest of the book are far more broad ranging and complex.  Nonetheless, the ideas are presented well and argued competently.  Some of the economics did soar over my head and while not agreeing with everything, the book does give one much to think about.  It is sure to be a controversial read that has some interesting ideas.	2001-04-05

He was a fascinating man of his times who was a part of the Elizabethan court and involved in or aware of most of the advances in general science, geography (particulary cartography), and astronomy.  He was also involved with what are considered more occult activities in our times such as alchemy, astrology and talking with spirits (with the assistance and possibly under the influence of Kelley, an interesting character in his own right).  Dr. Dee would not have seen the differences so sharply between science and the occult as we do now and it is interesting watching his pursuits shift smoothly from one to the other.  The book is a straight forward narrative history of this man and it is, therefore, as fascinating as Dr. Dee was.  Those looking for a more in-depth look at science or the occult in Renaissance England will be dissappointed, though.  The book touches on many topics, such as the tantilizingly brief discussion of spys in the England of Elizabeth, that are not drawn out further than their point of contact with John Dee.  It is a good, nicely written examination of one man of his time not a look at one man through the complexities of his time.  It will entertain the reader looking for information on this fascinating individual and, hopefully, will lead one to read more about this interesting period of English history.	2001-03-31

Rubenstein's When Jesus Became God (The Struggle to Define Christianity during the Last Days of Rome) looks at the major controversy kicked off by the Alexandrian priest Arius when he posited a theory that Jesus was not equal to God and then the ideas blossomed from there.  The book presents a hundred years of this particular controversy in an informative manner giving space to all sides and acquainting the reader with all the combatants through clear and precise character descriptions, from the bishops to the emperors to the &quot;barbarians&quot;.  The author explains the often convoluted religious doctrines in a readable and understandable style. He focuses on the actual conflict and creates an entertaining and very dramatic look at a turning point in the Christian religion that would have far reaching consequences down through the centuries.  A wonderful examination of an important topic.	2001-03-22

Not knowing too much about the Civil War, this seemed a good place to begin.  The material was presented along with a good introduction to the issues behind this collision of two cultures in one country, beginning at the time of the nullification crisis.  Many voices are heard throughout this story, mostly politicians, though, as these fateful six months were a political struggle.  Occasionally the inactivity of the participants as they play a waiting game can transfer over to impatience to the reader but this is, otherwise, quite an exciting account for readers interested in looking at the small and large beginnings of a great and horrific event.  This piece of historical writing is well researched and well put together.	2001-03-20

Ultimately, it is a satisfying read but the journey is not always pleasant as Elizabeth grows up and grows older.  The male characters are not always drawn as finely but it is, of course, not their story but Elizabeth's.  The need for love creates and sustains this story and gives the novel its razor sharp painfulness.  I wished I enjoyed the character of Elizabeth more as then it would be her personality that took me through this novel instead of being propelled by the wonderful prose of Amy Bloom over the slow spots.  In the end, a good book if not always a pleasure.	2001-03-14

She focuses on Jewisth fundamentalism in Israel, Muslim fundamentalism in Egypt and Iran and Christian fundamentalism in America.  This volume bears all the hallmarks familiar to readers of Ms. Armstrong, such as thorough, broad-ranging reasearch, a passion for different forms of spirituality and a plea for understanding.  She presents a balanced account of this growth, beginning with a long look at the impact of modernity in the West (starting in the pivotal year 1492) before tackling this complex century.  The reader is, thus, able to understand the why and how of the upsurge of fundamentalism at its origins until it has represented itself in recent times as a religion of such fear, anger and hate.  It is a fascinating topic that is handled beautifully and fairly.  An interesting and important read.	2001-03-13

His memoir flits from his Jewish childhood, family history, gay New York (actually only Chelsea, actually only one avenue in Chelsea), Greek language and literature, and beautiful (mostly now dead) Southern boys.  He is building a mythology of himself and the process is wonderful to go through even when the creation of said mythos requires the narrowing of his vision.  He is blissfully unaware of gay men outside of Chelsea and the fever dreams of his Southern past, partly because many of these men would not fit his defintion as &quot;boys&quot; and quite likely fall outside his radar.  But that is understandable in a memoir such as this when the point is to write what you see and not what remains invisible to you.  Also I was less than thrilled with the chapter on being a surrogate father (gay men as the new spinster aunts?) but even here the writing carried me along.  As did the references to Greek myths that connected and substantiated all the ideas.  These were evocative and necessary to the entire book.  A well written look at myth making on a personal level that is worth a read.	2001-03-08

Dower's immense and impressive work, Embracing Defeat, Japan in the Wake of World War II, is well written, thoroughly researched and amazingly wide ranging in its examination of Japan.  The book covers culture, politics, economics, philosophy and virtually all aspects of society from a varied range of sources from public documents and newspapers to secret reports, diaries, and poems, to name only a small fraction of the material.  He presents many sides to any issue discussed, both the American perspective and the myriad of Japanese views.  The delight of this book is watching it break down the image of a monolithic Japanese culture and instead present a complex tapestry of Japanese viewpoints and ideas that existed under the American occupation.  It is a wonderful history of a hinge moment in Japan.  Very well done.	2001-03-06

Her whole world is crumbling from the micro-situation of her father deserting the family to the macro-situation of the sitting President (the book is set in 1973).  It is a marvelous portrayal of this little girl and how she tries to control the one thing in her world she thinks she can control, solving the murder of a twelve year old boy.  It is chilling to see how something so innocent and Nancy Drewish to this girl becomes so frightening as false accusations change the neighborhood and destroy lives.  Those looking for a mystery with a solution will be dissappointed but those looking for a more complicated portrayal of childhood should be delighted with this book.	2001-03-03

It is ultimately a sad novel.  It is written with the romanticism of past centuries in its truly Victorian sensibility, which is found in the writing.  It could have gone a little farther in that direction, particulary in the Manhattan castle sequences which could have used a taste more of Mervyn Peake's neo-Gothic romanticism.  The imagery would pull back a little just when it should have thrust forward but this is a minor quibble in an impressive first novel with a very original idea combined with a feel for the past.	2001-03-02

The translation of the Nibelungenlied by A. T. Hatto takes the poem from its poetic roots and turns it into readable prose in an effective manner.  This is a marvelous work with some truly memorable characters, particulary the women, and much grisly excitement (the author of the epic will never be cited for subtlety).  It is easy to see why this inspired such works as Wagner's Ring Cycle.  There is a lot of rich material in these legends and myths.  An added bonus are the wonderful appendices at the back that could lead the reader to a richer second read of this book at some point in the future.

Nightmare on Main Street is a fascinating look at a dark, disturbing, interesting subject.  The joy in this book, and sometimes its frustration, is the wide range from two centuries old gothic novels to Forrest Gump, Oprah and Iron John/Women Who Run With Wolves.  The connections are not always clear but the writing will carry the reader along this weird academic roller coaster ride as they nod along in agreement (for me particulary the Forrest Gump section) or they shake their head in exasperation or frustration.  Either way it will get the reader thinking of everything around them in terms of gothic or angel (and these words are very loosely defined in order to create a net big enough to catch all of Edmundson's concepts).  This book was an intelligent read.	2001-02-28

Mystic River is an exciting read with an aura of violence on every page, usually held firmly in check.  It is fascinating how this one traumatic incidence (one of the three boys being abducted) that lead off the novel reverberates throughout the story but it is equally interesting how other incidents from each of the grown men's past circle around them.  Everyone seems to pay for the crimes they did or the crimes that were done to them in this dance through the rougher areas of Boston.  The actual mystery should be fairly straight forward to solve early enough in the book for most readers and it does rely on many coincidences (this must be a insulated and isolated area of town) but the true pleasure of the novel is in watching these finely drawn characters deal with the repercussions of the events.  This book will lead me to further Dennis Lehane novels.	2001-02-27

Dark City truly does explore the Lost World of Film Noir in a way that makes the entire genre come alive.  This is the best noir book I have ever read and it should be effective and fascinating reader for almost anyone, whether they are used to exploring the Dark City or are just thinking of moving there.  His analysis of particular films and stars is brilliant and will keep the reader going back and forth to the video store to keep up with the author and this funny, bleak world.  I eagerly await Eddie Muller's book on women in noir and a chance to return once again to the Dark City.	2001-02-26

It is a complete history and each decade is shown in its origianl bright colours or dark hues or some gorgeous combination of both.  Batman is served very well as the author lovingly (yet often critically) looks at the many changes this character has gone through and survived.  A particular joy is the first chapter and its look at pulps, the real roots of Batman.  The book is also useful in its examination of other media, such as TV, movies and the weird and witty range of merchandise produced to cash in on various Batman crazes.  This book is pure pleasure and will result in a joyous nostalgic sugar rush for the lucky reader.  A great read.	2001-02-25

This one was a little harder to bear than some of the others as so very many of the personalities were selfish and cruel.  That was probably, though, what made this book a little different from the rest of the (ice) pack and all the more horrific.  These experiences brought out a person's true character and it wasn't pretty much of the time, starting early when their captain deserted them.  There were also a few instances of heroics and true compassion.  This is a fine addition to the Arctic and Antartic literature sprouting like weeds throughout the history section of book stores.  If these stories have become your addiction, you do not want to miss this one.	2001-02-24

Ross shines a light on a little known and rarely examined period of cinema and labour history.  In Working-Class Hollywood (Silent Film and the Shaping of class in America), he looks at the movies created by, for or against the labour movement and its emerging class identity.  It is so interesting as it is a time of growth and struggle for both the cinema and the labour movements and the author shows how these two forces bumped and grinded with each other in a way movies never would again.  Movies helped create a certain image of class and by the thirties this was pretty much set in stone so it is the period of the silent film where the struggle to shape that identity ensued.  This book is amazingly well researched and accessible for the reader of either cinema, labour, or American history.  Sometimes the author stretches his point and the reader will be frustrated that many of the films discussed are unavailable for viewing but these are small caveats to an impressive work.	2001-02-23

It is a broader, more international examination into the reasons for Hollywood gaining world wide dominance of the film industry.  This is not about movies per se but is, instead, about the business and politics of making movies.  It includes many anecdotes, told in a basically chronological format, from the beginning of the industry to the recent times.  Much of this information was new to me as most film histories concentrate on the movies and the men and women who create these works.  This one concentrates on the men who finance these works.  An interesting book for those interested in the deals behind the deals that make the movies we love.	2001-02-22

Books	4	2	3	N	N	One Side of a Pivotal Historical Event	Diana Preston's Boxer Rebellion (The Dramatic Story of China's War on Foreigners That Shook the World in the Summer of 1900) is an easy, enjoyable read but it is certainly not a definitive history of the Boxer Rebellion.  It focuses primarily on the trapped foreigners during the siege of Peking and their rescue by an international force.  She does include chapters on events outside of Peking but the thrust of the book is based on the experiences of the foreigners in Peking.  As far as that goes, the book is excellent and gives a vivid picture of the event.  It is not quite as harrowing a read as Ms. Preston's A First Rate Tragedy but it definately keeps the attention and shows both the courage and cowardice, the clear thinking and the xenophobic ignorance, of this group of people.  The book does not explore the larger issues of the Boxer Rebellion and does not include much from the Chinese side of events.  This book is a wonderful read, though, for anyone interesting in an exiciting, dramatic period of history.	2001-02-21

If either of these concepts sound like a bad idea for cinema, this book may not be for you.  Kim Newman's Apocalypse Movies (End of the World Cinema) is a joy to read as he takes the reader through a rogue's gallery of weird charaters while charting the science fiction and horror movies that have signaled mankind's doom since cinema began.  The book is well researched, nicely written and much fun.  These joyous films will be presented to the reader in a new and larger context that will only deepen their delightfully guilty pleasure. A wonderful book.	2001-02-20

The book travels through more than film history (much, much more) as the reader explores, dragged by the wonderful writing of the author, crime, unions, politics, communism, war, racisim and a host of other isms.  This book is about the parts of America that float to the surface of the pool of churning, boiling water that is Hollywood and it is not always a pretty grouping of flotsam and jetsam.  The author captures the personality of the characters in this soapy drama with beautiful ease and, often, humour.  It was a joy from beginning to end and deserves far more than five stars.  A book about Hollywood for those who care about history and do not see a light shining on some very gloomy corners of history.	2001-02-19

The most significant and interesting aspects of the book were the politics involved, both in the production of the movies and the movies themselves.  Movies looked at vice, poverty, and politics, for example, with eyes wide open and this frightened many people in power who led a successful campaign against the industry.  This book tells that tale very effectively.  It is a joy to read.	2001-02-18

He concentrates on the countries of England, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Russia, Japan and American as they hurtle towards a war that seems all but inevitable, driven on by the Depression and the growth of militaristic and totalitarian states.  The reader will also hurtle through this massive book along with the decade covered on the roller coaster ride the author provides.  One of the great charms of the book is the author's ability to select just the right quote from an observer at the time to make the reader feel the events on a personal level.  Both the right and left get skewered along the way.  The author throws his own opinion in and it is often as keenly observant as his selected quotes.  This book is in the marvelous tradition of Barbara Tuchman, particulary her Proud Tower covering the period before the First World War.  It is a marvelous achievment and a wonderful read for history buffs.  Highly recommended.	2001-02-17

The working life of Frances Marion has the advantage of coinciding with the birth of movies as Marion began working on scripts for silent movies in the teens and continued into the sound era and the advent of World War II.  This biography also has the joy of highlighting many of the other unique women of Hollywood as Frances Marion traveled in a powerful Hollywood clique.  It is a wonderful look at Hollywood between the wars from the vantage point of Frances Marion.  Occasionally, it would have been helpful if the author could have expanded the view a little to give a larger context outside of Frances Marion's own sphere of influence and given a broader perspective of the film industry.  But what is seen in both entertaining and informative.  There was for me real sadness at the end of this book as all these great women pass away but, now at least, one of them is captured lovingly and brilliantly in this fine biography.	2001-02-16

The book concentrates on the seventies and eighties in the music industry, after a too-short introduction to place the events in an historical context.  It focuses on certain individual and specific companies in its anecdotes as it traces their rise and fall. The author is not providing a history of the industry.  Instead he is offering a freak show of its most colourful characters. The book pulls few punches as it explores this twisted business.  Above all, it is a fun read for any reader, even those not interested in the music industry.	2001-02-15

Make Believe, The Broadway Musical in the 1920's, will have something for those with little prior knowledge of musical theatre history as well as a little something for those with far too much knowledge of musical theatre in the twenties.  As usual with Mr. Mordden, the clearly presented chronology and history comes complete with fascinating anecdotes and interesting opinions.  This is a fascinating period in the history of musical theatre as artists and stars and formulas both tried and fought against change until the triumph of Show Boat arose from the water.  The reader will get a clear understanding of the era through this book as well as a cotton candy nostalgia for a period of time one did not even live through.	2001-02-13

It looks at text and subtext and context to find the gay meaning or the meaning for gays in the annals of historical literature.  Along the way the reader will learn new aspects of literature (such as the chapter on African poetry, to name one example from my own ignorance) and new ways to look at familiar books and poems.  For all its breadth, it is wonderfully readable and somewhat addictive.  It had me searching out various books to read them for myself.  The writing is so good that I was equally fascinated reading about the books I had not read or did not even know about as I was reading about the others.  This is a very good survey and a fun read.	2001-02-12

The Golden Compass is composed of wonderfully dark materials for a fantasy, and some very frightening, gory moments.  It is fun to see the see the ways in which this world differs from our own and the ways in which it is the same (or how we could have been like them with minor variations in our history).  Beyond all the fantasy are the marvelous characters drawing the reader forward, particulary Lyra.  It is a rare treat to encounter such an aggressive hero in the form of a little girl.  She truly goes in where others fear to tread and she keeps the momentum of the novel rolling along.  Be warned, the ending is something of a cliff hanger so be prepared to begin the second part of the trilogy as soon as you can.	2001-02-11

The history is presented as a series of observations and anecdotes from many people who lived in the gay scene during this time.  The subtitle is a little misleading as the book is really only covering New York and not America and there is no he said, she said as it is basically (with a few very interesting exceptions) only men who are covered in this book.  It is by no means a definitive history but it is an entertaining read as the stories are usually told well and are intimately personal.  As the book goes on, most readers over the age of thirty will learn nothing new but it still reads quickly and pleasantly.  A fun volume for the general reader of a slice of the Big Apple gay life.	2001-02-11

To be sure, the bulk of the book is on the earlier and middle periods.  Two of the chapters also focus on women to some extent.  It is interesting to see how the YMCA came into being and how its development echoed the social development of the society it was a part of and, even more fascinating, the ways in which it tried to influence society.  This book fits into homosexual history but is broader in contexst than that as it is truly the history of same-sex relations, including sexual, but also including friendship and mentoring and sometimes comibinations of all three.  It is the story of the changing homosocial environment all people of a certain class (middle) lived within.	2001-02-10

Raup has written an interesting account of the scientic process in The Nemesis Affair (A Story of the Death of Dinosaurs and the Ways of Science).  This is a perfect book for the non-specialist as it gives a glimpse into the larger world science inhabits beyond the minutiae of scientific details.  This book shows the ways in which the scientific community, the popular press, and the general public all compete and struggle in creating and accepting (or dismissing) new ideas.  The belief that dinosaurs died out partially due to a meteor or comet colliding with earth is one such idea and its genesis from a small spark of inspiration into common belief is told in a clear and entertaing fashion.  This is a book that is interesting for the scientific idea it is trying to postulate as well as for the way it illuminates the larger world science is trying to inform and shape.	2001-02-09

It tells the tale of the Lady Franklin Bay Expedition, which was planned to set up a scienitic base at Lady Franklin Bay with supply ships arriving in the summers to replenish the explorers.  When those ships do not arrive, an interesting story of beauracratic incompetence on its own account, the explorers travel down the coast to meet their fate.  Thanks to the journals left by the explorers, their long struggle against starvation can told, with forays into murder, suicide and cannibalism for the more bloody-minded. Leonard F. Guttridge does a superb job of bringing this tragedy to life for the reader.  These arctic misadventures are enormously popular right now and fine examples such as this one help to explain their popularity.	2001-02-08

Disch's The Dreams our Stuff is Made Of (How Science Fiction Conquered the World) is just how flat out entertaining this crazy quilt history of science fiction writing truly is.  It is also wonderfully opinionated and sure to upset many science fiction readers, or readers of any kind, beginning with some outrageous and thought provoking words about about dear Edgar Allan Poe and working its controversial way towards the millenium. This book should make one question one's assumptions about why and how one reads a book and that is a good thing.  This clever read should also send the reader out to read and re-read some science fiction classics and trash to evaluate for oneself the statements made by Mr. Disch.  A wonderful cock-eyed look at science fiction to be avoided only by those afraid of strong opinions and smart writing.	2001-02-07

This book, What Remains to Be Discovered, is not fully comprehensive or authoritative but the author, instead, selects certain important topics and digests them into small enough sizes to be understandable to a wide variety of readers and large enough to cover the selected topic with appropriate breadth.  It is sometimes a struggle for the non-science minded but the the author always manages to get across the basic idea and, more importantly, just why this idea will be so important in the future.  I enjoyed this challenging book more than I had any right to do.	2001-02-06

Bowler's Life's Splendid Drama looks at evolutionary biology and the reconstruction of life from 1860 - 1940, particulary emphasizing the earlier period.  It demonstrates that Darwin's ideas were not immediately transcendent, as is often presented, but instead they competed with many other ideas concerning evolution swirling around for many decades following the Origin of the Species.  This is a challenging book for the non-specialist but it does provide an important look at the history of science in a very well researched and detailed manner.  It is a massive read and I often had to struggle with concepts that have grown cloudy since I took biology (and could very well have been cloudy then) but it is an invaluable look at the sometimes troubled birth of modern biological science.	2001-02-05

This book shows the development from fringe to mainstream of the ideas shared by a group of people in the 1910's.  The book is by no means hagiography as the darker moments of the ACLU are presented with clarity, such as their hounding and forcing out of Communist members simply for their beliefs.  It is both very informative and truly entertaining.  A wonderful book that demonstrates the importance the ACLU has had in the twentienth century shaping political ideas.	2001-02-04

He has many good and valuable reasons for doing so as is made obvious as the book, and the year, unfold before the reader.  It is all here from the growing imperialism of the United States as it becomes involved in Cuba and the Philippine, as well as labour disputes, the growth of businesses such as Uneeda Biscuit and the Ford Motor Company, in addition to many more assorted characters and stories running throughout this history.  Ms. Tuchman in the Proud Tower effectively covered some of the same issues, particulary the U.S. involvement with Cuba, in a very efficient fashion that laid events out a little more plainly.  David Traxel does, on occasion, feel the need to soften or defend American actions. The book is still entertaining, though, and hopefully would lead a reader to learn more about the interesting events and people presented here.	2001-02-03

James B. Stewart in Blood Sport, the President and his Adversaries, presents a wonderfully detailed look at the people and issues behind the trouble during Bill Clinton's presidency.  It is now a little dated but still as important and relevant as the people may changed but politics remains the same.  The author attacks in a very clear fashion the main problems bedeviling the Clintons, including often their own arrogance.  This book names names and gives a perceptive look the people behind the scenes in politics who spend their time turning politics into the blood sport it has become, and probably always has been.  An interesting read.	2001-02-02

Although, however, baseball may have changed during this period, one thing never changed and that is the importance of money and business in the sport.  This was one of the most fascinating aspects of the sports history.  In addition, the book gives marvelous personal sketches of many of the players, a social history of Balitmore and New York at the turn of the century, and, along the way, I even managed to pick up a bit knowledge of baseball.  More interesting than I expected and highly recommended for the sports fan.	2001-02-01

It is an ambitious book as it looks at certain pivotal times of resistance or revolution througout these centuries in order to connect all of the countries and the various peoples around the Atlantic, including France, the United States, England, Ireland and the Caribbean, and men and women, black and white, sailor, soldier, and artisan.  Each of the episodes is interesting and significant in their own right and the connections between them only adds further importance.  More research should be done to connect the spaces between the events but this book stands on its own as an important addition to the history of resistance.  A very fascinating read.	2001-01-31

The first part of the book sets up the time and place, smoothly and efficiently bringing in elements of class and capitalism.  The middle part of the book is the bursting of the dam in which the reader literally rides down the river with the water on its exciting and terrifying collision with history.  There is time enough for heroes and more than a few shocks along the way.  The last part of the book is the sad cleanup and the finger pointing.  It is the story of a town devastated by the people on the hill told with great style and set in a larger context.  Another fine piece of historical writing from David McCullough.	2001-01-30

The novel has a gripping beginning in the election of 1800 covering the tie between Jefferson and his vice presidential nominee, Aaron Burr.  The book, unfortunately, loses some steam with the section portraying the Louisiana Purchase.  It was not as tighly written and suspenseful as the election as it meanderend like the Mississippi itself through the lives of all the characters.  It worked very hard for historical accuracy, and achieved it to a great extent, but sacrificed to history any element of surprise.  The history was good but the drama suffered at times for that.  Definately worth a look for the first half of the book and it is a good omen for the next book in the series as it will be dealing more with the behind the scenes Washington politics.	2001-01-29

Litwack has assembled a massive book, Trouble in Mind, that will take the reader through the entire life of African Americans living under the Jim Crow laws in the South.  All the stories are taken from original sources that allow the authentic voices of the African Americans to heard whether in protest, agony, prayer, sadness, sympathy, anger, or the range of other emotions pouring out from this book and their stories.  Many of the voices recur throughout the book and become very familiar to the reader.  The book is designed so as to take the reader from childhood under Jim Crow until death and having those familiar voices appearing throughout the book does add a horrifying element of the seeing how the Jim Crow laws and racial attitudes in the South were all encompassing and affected a person's entire life.  It does help if the reader has a familiarity with the history of this period to truly understand the stories in this book.  It is a fine work that allows the voices of African Americans to speak out about the times they lived through.	2001-01-28

It does not quite live up to the subtitle (King Philip's War and the Origins of American Identity) but it is a broad ranging and exciting view of an important event in American colonial history.  One of the main pleasures of this book is in the ways it shows how this War in the 1670's was represented at the time and how its history was changed and manipulated in many various ways all the way through the end of the nineteenth century.  The sources include diaries, newspaper account, letters, and plays (a very interesting part of the book), among other sources.  Looking at all sources left by natives over the centuries also provides a great illumination on this horribly tragic period of time, particulary for the native Americans.  An admirable piece of historical research and writing.	2001-01-27

It reads like a novel (occasionally making one question the entire truthfulness behind the characters should the plot slow down enough for such speculation, which it does not). There are heroes and there are villains, there are victims and there are survivors, there are lessons learned and lessons forgotten.  You will never look at storm warnings or a wind coming off the ocean in the same way again.  I initially read this book in New York while the edge of a hurricane tugged at the apartment windows.  I do not recommend that but reading this book you will feel in the middle of a hurricane wherever you are.  An excellant read that earns the praise that it has received.	2001-01-26

Merrell has selected a specific topic for his book, Into the American Woods (Negotiations on the Pennsylvania Frontier).  He looks at the go-betweens (both Indian and colonial) who did the negotiating in colonial Pennsylvania.  The narrowness of this specific topic is deceptive as the go-betweens were from two worlds and through them can be glimpsed a piece of history much bigger than themselves.  It is ultimately a sad story for the Indians as the Pennsylvania frontier of the title keeps moving north and westward until by the end of the book there seem to be virtually no Indians left in Penn's Woods despite, and often because of, all the negotiating between the two groups.  The characters who comprise the book are an interesting and little understood assortment and this is thorough and informative study of these men (and a very, very few women).  An interesting place to begin looking at a clash of cultures through the times they tried to come together.	2001-01-26

Corey has written an entertaining, well researched and, in its own delightful way, charming look at a magazine in the middle of the twentienth century.  This is important because the magazine is the New Yorker and it reflects the attitudes and thoughts of a certain group of Americans of this period, a sort of floating liberalism.  The author looks at the New Yorker's views of women, other races, communism and servants (among other subjects) in its fiction, articles and cartoons.  New Yorker magazine does not necessarily come out all good in this but that is part of the pleasure of this book.  It is not written as a form of nostalgia (although there is always a whiff present) but as a serious look at an important time in American history and what some leading writers and journalists were thinking and creating at this time.  There is much positive among the negative and it does give the reader a real feeling for how important a magazine can be and, particulary, have been in the past.  A very good book and an excellant look at an important magazine.	2001-01-26

Gail Collins' Scorpion Tongues is, according to its subtitle, the irrestible history of gossip in American politics, and that is exactly what it is.  It will be just right for the reader who will want to settle down and take pleasure in all the mud slinging of the past and for a chance to realize that neither times nor people change all that much.  The book does try to give a spin to the stories in order to justify the book on more enlightened grounds of trying to show historical patterns and different eras and forms of gossip.  But that is not why people are reading this book and that is not why the readers will be passing this book to their friends.  It's the gossip, stupid.  A scandal filled romp through American history.	2001-01-26

Helen Jewett is the centre of the story and the author gives as much information as she can so that Jewett becomes a living character in history rather than as the symbol she became at the time of her murder.  This book is much more than a sensational murder and trial as it becomes a thoroughly researched and wonderfully readable look into the growing pains of a big city.  This story is about men and women, clerks and prostitues, legal codes and tabloid journalism, politics and capitilism.  Ms. Cohen does a superb job of taking all of these pieces and truly bringing the 1830's Manhattan alive for the reader.  A true find and a great pleasure.	2001-01-26

The Supreme Court was ignored and the poor man was lynched which provoked the Supreme Court to the unusual action of becoming involved.  This is a well written and exciting telling of the events and will carry the reader along on a wave of outrage.  It is sure to be turned into an exciting film.  It does not, unfortunately, tell the whole story of lynching, nor is to trying to.  This one action by the Supreme Court belies the inactivity of the court and the justice system to stem the tide of lynching and racial injustice.  But that story is told in other books and the reader will find this particular book a fascinating footnote on legal and racial history in America, both good and bad.	2001-01-26

The business side of the book is fascinating as the two companies, with entirely different philosophies, vie for dominance.  For these business stories alone the book is worth reading.<br />An added bonus of the book is a new way to look at chocolate.  As a Canadian who worked in the States, I learned why I did not eat as much chocolate as I did in Canada and why Hershey bars have that (to me) peculiar taste and why there are no Smarties, only M&amp;Ms in the United States.  You can follow along in the book as each new product is introduced with your own taste testing.  History never tasted so good.	2001-01-25

It tells the story of a number of left leaning, idealistic, young, and adventurous women who emerged in New York around the turn of the century and grew in prominence and significance larger than than this one town in this one time.  Among the more famous women are Margaret Sanger, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Dorothy Day, and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn (a personal favourite).  This book is not a dry, academic look at the reasons behind the rise of some women at this time, nor is it an examination of the lives of the women in general in New York at this time.  This book, instead, explodes with the joy of being in the right place and the right time and having the courage and idealism to believe you can change things.  Ms. Adickes takes the reader to the beating heart of New York when it truly had one and brings this time alive and shows us some true heroes in their prime.  A pleasure to read.	2001-01-24

Massie's The Romanovs (the Final Chapter) was less about what finally happened than about the search by various people into the truth about what finally happened.  This makes the book a fascinating addition to the legends and truths about the Romanovs and concludes their story quite conclusively.  There is more than enough historical background for the reader not familiar with the story of the Romanovs but the true interest of this story will be for the readers who are fully steeped in this story.  The author has a sure touch in making this book as interesting in the saga of terror and betrayal as he does he in the parts concerning scientific investigation.  A wonderful and mandatory addition to the cache of Romanov books on the market.	2001-01-23

The book is all over the place in subject matter at times as geography mixes with food which then gets splashed with the gore of crime amongst the many trails followed.  This ranging of theme would be turned to chaos by a lesser writer but Mr. Robb creates a colourful tapestry of a place that becomes intimately real to the reader.  It is, without a doubt, a sad place but there are heroes shining through as well as other small moments of joy sparkling in the darkness.  There is something for all readers in this book and the reader will definately be both transported and educated but, most of all, the reader will be entertained.	2001-01-22

The book ranges and prowls over many communities from the scientific to the farmer to the sideshow.  This is more about the lack of firm boundaries in Victorian society as science tried to define itself than the author's whim.  But the author does handle the twists and turns adroitly.  This is a good read and a wonderful look at the Victorian period and what the scientist and the lay person considered important in their need to classify their world, particulary as it grew with the growth of the British Empire.	2001-01-21

Using the characters of Jonathan Wild and the folk hero/criminal Jack Sheppard, the author expands the narrative to show the entire world of crime and punishment that existed at this time.  Very little seemed, at times, to separate those committing the crimes from those prosecuting the criminals and it is easy to see why Jack Sheppard, with his numerous escapes, could become such a hero in such a corrupt system.  The story is told in a way that leads the reader from the beginnings of a system that would lead to crime to the execution of the criminal.  The two lead criminals sometimes fall by the wayside in their own story but interest is maintained nonetheless by looking at the larger canvas.  An interesting read.	2001-01-20

Bleys' Geography of Perversion covers the entire globe, two centuries and hundreds of original sources.  It is a very thorough study concerning the examination of the way the West (whether travelers, colonizers, conquerors or anthropologists, and often a combination of these) viewed the peoples with which it came into contact.  The examples ranged from Japan and China to the Americas to Africa and into the Middle East.  It was fascinating to see how the perceptions changed over time, not because of changes in these countries but because of the needs of the West.  The book is a very challenging read and is probably not suited for the casual reader of history or gay studies and it often had the feel of PhD thesis.  It is an important work, though, that can be rewarding for the serious reader.	2001-01-19

This one is a brief, basically narrative, history of the German Empire, much more narrative and less thematically based than the previous editions of this series.  It is handled with great precision in the limited space available and will give the reader a basic understanding of the issues surrounding the German Empire.  Because of the small size of the format, there will also be many questions in the readers mind but now at least the reader will be able to ask the right questions.  This book definately leads to an interest in Germany during this period, both in politics and culture, both of which are touching upon in this little book.	2001-01-01

Dunlop's Gilded City began slowly for me as I got used to her style but then nothing could stop me.  This book is full of salacious gossip and horrifying scandal.  The behavior of the rich would be laughable if it was not at the expense of the poor.  If Ms. Dunlop does not exactly take a position, she does create one by her selection of material.  She truly makes the disparity between rich and poor come alive in a way that is shocking and true.  The sources are limited to newspaper accounts and this is not a truly historical survey of the decade but it does achieve what it sets out to do.  It creates for the reader a glimpse of the social world at this time as seen by the readers of the newspaper and the members of society trying to get in the newspapers.  A fun, frightening read.	2000-12-31

The city was unusual because of the different groups and the unique individuals vying for dominance or existence.  The book includes much information on events and people during this time although presented and written in a manner often less thrilling than the material whould allow.  The focus is on the Europeans, Americans and Australians and the important Asians they come into contact with during their stay.  For the most part, these people are a grasping, greedy lot and loyalties shift quite easily.  A hard look at the Asian populations during this period in Shanghai would help complete the picture.  An interesting first look at a fascinating city at a pivotal period.	2000-12-29

This piece of history, in Ms. Fraser's capable hands, becomes a story and moves alond at the  brisk pace of an adventure novel.  This is not to say that the historical and scholarly research is not present only to say that the narrative never feels bogged down with it.  This book will definately lead me to read both more of this period of British history and, especially, more of Antonia Fraser.	2000-12-29

It is almost unbelievable that this one man, after having a dream of ascending to heaven, can have mustered a rebellion against the Manchu Dynasty that was stunning in its success and devasting in its failure as twenty million Chinese lay dead at the end of the almost twenty year rebellion.  Jonathan D. Spence, in God's Chinese Son, covers this material with his usual combination of both writing skill and scholary research.  The reader may occasionally get bogged down in the fine details, particulary with no knowledge of Chinese history from this period, but this book provides a wonderful ride through an unusual time and place in history.	2000-12-27

It shows how natural disasters may arrive from nature (as flood, hurricane, earthquake, drought, etc.) but it is the social and cultural context of American that truly turns these phenomena into disasters.  This can result from such things lack of warning due to budget cuts, downplaying the effects of the disaster in order to support boosterism, or controlling relief efforts in way that hurts the poor, elderly or minorities.  The unusually high proportion of death and loss of property of people in mobile homes is not, in fact,due to random, natural acts or some perverse vendetta against by natural forces against mobile homes but, instead, by purposeful acts by government and capitilists.  These arguments are presented forcefully using examples from throughout American history.  On occasion, particulary the chapter on weather control, the arguments can become a little muddied.  It is, nevertheless, a fairly powerful indictment of the current system that will result in more disasters than it will prevent.	2000-12-27

It begins with Marco Polo and ends in the twentienth century.  It is fascinating to watch the image of China change over time, not to meet reality but to serve the ends of the viewer.  This brief study is a wonderful way to see how image can be and is manipulated by the observer.  This book draws on the accounts of literture, missionaries, historians, politicians, travelers, merchants and many others in its eclectic ride through the centuries.  It is both knowledgable and entertaining and worth a read.	2000-12-25

Each is a very short history of a area or theme by a renowned historian (or writer) with a knowledge in that area.  The small size (usually aroung one hundred and fifty pages) means that these are obviously not comprehensive histories.  This is quite true of this particular volume on the Balkans.  There is a brief chronology at the beginning but the book itself does not provide any narrative history at all.  Instead the book is separated into themes allowing the reader to understand the complexity and personality of this complicated region.  In that it is quite effective.  It debunks many of the myths about the Balkans that have grown in this century but also leaves many questions.  In a work such as this, that is a good thing as questions lead to further study and greater understanding.  This will not give the reader a complete knowledge of this region but will serve beautifully as a jumping off point for further exploration.  A very interesing read.	2000-12-24

It ends with the suicide of Crown Prince Rudolf but before that event this book of a city captures the personalities of such people as Sigmund Freud, Arthur Schnitler, Gustav Mahler and Theodor Herzl.  It was an amazing time in this city and the author brings together all of these highs and lows of politics, art, culture, and society into a delightful tapestry.  The reader truly gets a feel for this city and these people and part of the joy, for the reader, is knowing what the future will hold for many of these characters, such as the struggling Freud.  This is not a work of anaylitical history.  One does not understand why this time and this city but the reader can sit back and enjoy the ride through this slice of history.	2000-12-23

Its tale twists over many decades and three continents and then twists back again.  The beauty of the writing and the style of the author is how he is able to create so much in so little space.  The reader understands the characters quickly and sympathizes with them instantly.  These are basically good people moved to do things they would not otherwise do by an irrestible force in the form of a man, Axel.  The themes of lost chances and the interconnectedness of everyone are present and poignant throughout the novel.  The suspense is in the first part of the novel but the strength of the story is in the revealing of the tapestry that created the action.  This novel was a joy, albeit bitter sweet.  Worth the time it will take to finish this beautiful little tale.	2000-12-23

It tells the story of businessman and amateur explorer Charles Francis Hall.  He goes in search of traces (possibly survivors?) of Sir John Franklin's expedition.  The third trip goes wrong and Charles Francis Hall dies and is buried in the North.  This book is driven by the personality of Hall and it is quite the personality.  He is obsessed, unlucky, amateurish at times, belligerent, and stubborn, but the best word that could be one used to describe him is one that is applied to the Arctic itself, weird.  The author captures the personality vividly with contemporary accounts, particulary those of Hall himself.  It is an interesting book of a footnote character in the great age of Arcitc exploration, and sometimes through these footnotes in history one can see the truth behind what drives the explorers in its rawest form.  An entertaining addition to the annals of history of the North.	2000-12-22

The Children of Henry VIII will fit quite nicely between the Wives of Henry VIII and The Life of Elizabeth.  This particular volume covers the period from the death of Henry VIII to the beginning of the rule of Elizabeth.  It is a wonderful period to study and read about as it covers the reigns of Edward and Mary and the almost reign of Jane Grey (not a child of Henry, of course, but a fine addition to this history).  This tumultous period is seen through the eyes of the children themselves and the religion confusion occuring at this time is truly brought to life. Ms. Weir does no disservice to this rich tapestry she is given and in her usual readable and exiciting style brings all of this royal madness directly to the reader.  A wonderfully entertaining read.  I was sorry when it was over.	2000-12-20

King Leopold of Belgium carves out an empire on the backs of the people in the area he annexes around the Congo, ultimately causing the deaths of upwards of ten million people.  This tale is not his alone and the intense pleasure and heartbreak of this piece of history is to see the struggle to fight against this man's schemes from both within the Congo and from outside the Congo in American and England.  The history of one man's greed and grasp becomes the story of millions of people and ultimately a tale that is as important in its own time as it is today.  A fine piece of historical writing on an important topic.	2000-12-20

Morrison Series in Southern Studies)	Books	5	16	20	N	N	The Biography of an Idea	Ben Tillman and the Reconstruction of White Supremacy by Stephen Kantrowitz is a well written and well researched voyage through an ugly chapter in American history that still reverberates strongly throughout the entire culture.  The selection of Ben Tillman as the focus point through which to examine the victory of white supremacy in the South after Reconstruction is brilliant and frighteninly effective.  This book is not so much the biography of Ben Tillman but really the biography of white supremacy as a political idea and ideal. This book captures all of the evil idealism, political pragmatism, the unique blend of bomblast and subtlety, and, especially, the terror and violence used by Ben Tillman and his ilk to secure their goals of making the political system of South Carolina all white and all Democrat.  It is a wonderful book of an ugly time that is important, unfortunately, to understanding our own time.  Well done.	2000-12-20

The actual beginning of this cycle would be Ms. Weir's book on the Wars of the Roses but this is the true start of the series that looks at the personal lives of the reigning Tudors.  This book, The Six Wives of Henry VIII, is a fat and delicious book that brings these very different women to life for the reader.  It is the way the author has of drawing the personality out of the sources that is the most rewarding aspect of this book.  History lives and is exciting because the reader feels the life within the history.  Alison Weir is a marvelous writer and makes the past both exciting and accesible.  A fine book of history and a wonderful place to spend a few entertaining hours.	2000-12-20

This time around Ms. Weir's entire skill and art are put to the service of a very remarkable woman who rightfully defined the age in which she lived.  The author's love for her subject shines through on every page and the only quibble (and it is very small as quibbles go) is that, on occasion, Ms. Weir is more apologetic than she needs to be.  All that aside, this is a marvelous book that brings the actual person alive for the reader and goes beyond the mythology to create a biography that fits wonderfully in amongst Ms. Weir's set of Tudor history books.  Another fine achievement from the pen of this wonderfully readable and entertaining historian.	2000-12-20

Knowing how the story comes out it is so sad to see the mistakes (large!) that were made along the way.  This is indeed a First Rate Tragedy that takes on the size of a national tragedy as it feels so personalized to these men and the British nation.  Their confidence in themselves and their nation provided both for their courage and heroism in the face of danger and for their fool hardy mistakes.  The reader is swept along with these men as Ms. Preston brings their personalities alive.  It is a tense and exciting read that is ultimatley filled with anguish for how close this adventure could have come to being a success.  It is a sad tale during one of the last hurrahs of the exploring spirit, told with great skill.	2000-12-20

Their scientific description is easy to follow and fun to imagine and they give plenty of bits and pieces of evidence derived from many sources, from past scientific explorations to mythology.  The theory, itself, is important and this book presents a clear case for it with enough background to put the flooding into a context both as an event and as scientific discovery.<br />Where the book goes too far is in giving it the title of Noah's Flood because now time most be spent justifying this said title.  The authors do go out of their way to explain how this flooding likely resulted in the Noah story of the Bible (as well as the flood story in Gilgamesh) many millenia later.  As most cultures have a version of the flood myth without the need for knowing about the Black Sea, it is quite likely there is no need for such a dramatic explanation of a common myth.  It could, cynically, be see as a way to sell more books.  That is too bad as the actual story around the Black Sea flooding is interesting enough.	2000-12-19

This novel, Hornito, is full of these small moments that add up to a light and easy read.  The characters are never developed but that could be because the main character never really connects with anyone but it does leave a film of shallowness over the entire surface of the novel.  This may work better as a series of monologues but does not entirely hold together as a novel.  The territory covered in this book has been covered before by other gay authors.  The humour helps create the illusion of originality but it does feel, at times, that one has been here before.<br />The novel, though, does come together nicely toward the end.  There are no big revelations but the small discoveries are handled in a sweetly touching manner that does ring true to the character and to life.  It is not a bad read but neither is it a great read.  It is a light novel that will fill some time with its humour and then dissappear forever.	2000-12-16

Much of his style with his wonderful use of the grand adventure mixed with shocking tidbit remain but Big Chief Elizabeth is a far more focused piece of work.  It does not roam the world and the centuries but cleanly focuses on the clash between two worlds:  Elizabethan England and the New World.  It sets up the mystery of the Roanoke lost colonists and the adventures of John Smith and Pocohontas, to name only two familiar situations within the book, within an historical framework that touches upon all the familiar characters of England and the early American colonization.  But best of all, the story is told with great skill, some humour, much derring do, and sympathy for all sides.  Milton is able to bring out the human elements of these almost mythical characters.  This book is highly recommended for anyone who likes a good, exciting story.  A fine achievement from a wonderful weaver of history.	2000-12-13

I will, of course, now see the documentary.  <br />I was very moved by the stories in this book.  This is not in any way, shape or form a scholary historical study of the phenomenon of kids riding the rails during the Depression.  Instead it is a panorama createde from various of their stories and all the more beautiful for their tales having been told in this manner.  The ways in which these kids were helped along the road and how these experiences changed and enhance their world view was particulary note worthy.  Receiving compassion taught compassion.  It was a scary, important time and it was nice to hear some authentic voices from that period.	2000-12-12

It is a fun way to look at history and the book delights in looking at what we know about these kings, what Shakespeare knew about these kings and what the sources for Shakespare may have known about these kings (in addition to what was just plain made up).  The reader will enjoy this look at how history has been made in the past using theatre and how myths are built up, changed and carried on (sometime for propaganda purposes).  It shows, in many ways, how the ideas of history changes over time and also shows the ways in which many people actually receive their historical knowledge, such as through historical plays.  Norwich sets out the task of examining history through the sometimes distorted historical lens of Shakespeare's play and succeeds wonderfully.  It could help to have a full understanding of the plays themselves but one can slide by with a partial understanding and still enjoy this marvelous book.	2000-12-11

It takes the reader through a year in the life of an Englishman, although it sometimes feels more like the author's interests than the interests of the average medieval Englishman are presented.  This book will not interest the person with more knowledge of the medieval period and could give a distorted vision of this time for the non-buff and leave the reader with more questions than answers.	2000-12-10

One of the possible explanations of this event is a volcano which created a dusky film over the world's atmosphere that changed the weather and altered the fortunes of empires.  The theroy is fascinating and fun kept within these historical parameters but the author takes it a little too far when he expands this one event to show how this shaped (in a direct line of descent) our own time.  This what ifing can go too far and, in this book, iy does and this detracts from the actual theory itself.  The book can be fun if not taken too seriously.	2000-12-10

Looking at her life is a wonderful way to examine this pivotal period in English history as she was a pivotal person, herself, during this period.  Sometimes she was a pawn in the plans of others but often she created her own destiny, while all the time remaining a creature of politics and a survivor at a time when very many did not.  The authors have done their research well and provide a very detailed account.  Often the financial details can be very revealing and occasionally monotonous to the casual historian but always important.  This is a very good study of an important woman.	2000-12-10

It is a little jarring to go from one of the source writers to another as their styles are often different and the short length of the excerpts does not allow enough time to get used to a particular format or way of expressing ideas before it is time to move on.  The flurry of names coming at the reader can be quite daunting, as well.  The best and most effective part of the book are the brief introductions before each original source.  They are concise, well-written and effectively prepare the reader for what is to come.  The book does make me want to read further in Irish history to help fill in some of the gaps left empty by this book.	2000-12-07

It is beautifully researched and covers the topic with great exhaustion over a wide area of chronolgical history.  The story does have certain repeating themes as Christianity spreads which could, at times, test the interest of the reader.  It also seems, at various stages in the book, that force and authority as a means of Christianizing a people is minimized at the expense of presenting the inherent qualities of the religion itself. The sections that show how the people themselves fought against Chritianity and maintained thier own religion help to balance this to a certain extent.  The bias of the sources is also at work here as most of the original sources would have been Christain.  A good book on topic that needs more work.	2000-12-06

It is an entertaining survey of the topic that will dissappoint any believers in Atlantis but will be of interest to any of those readers with a belief in the idea, if not the reality, of Atlantis.  This is not about discovering Atlantis but instead is about how the idea of Atlantis has been used and manipulated over the centuries until our own time.  This durability is a testament to the myth of Atlantis, which is destined to be with us a lot longer.  An entertaining and well written book on the power of legend.	2000-12-05

It is narrowly focused on his own geographic area of expertise, which is the border regions between France and Germany, so readers interested in a pan-European or British examination of witchcraft will have to look elsewhere. For the area that it does cover, it is minutely thorough. This can be both good or bad as there are many, many anecotes used for evidence of the various themes covered in the book but there is no broad perspective presented and defended. The author makes clear his intention to show the complexity of the social construction of witchcraft (which is good) by presenting all of these individual incidents showing that every case can be different from every other case (this can be frustrating for the reader as no general theme emerges to place all of these anecdotes within an historical wev). This book will give the reader some new insights into the complexity of the situation as he tackles other books on similar topics. A fine, yet narrow handling of the social and cultural framework necessary for the growth of the belief in witchcraft.	2000-12-04

It was not quite as good as Norman Cohn's Europe's Inner Demons (a very high benchmark, indeed) but it posesses the same potent ability to chart accurately and interestely a trend from the past in its own historical context and then to demonstrate to the reader the ways in which this knowledge is important for an  understanding within our own historical period.  He cleanly takes the reader through the various millenial movements in a way that is both entertaining, informative, and, best of all, understandable.  The adept mind of an historian blended with the skill of a writer.  A good book.	2000-12-04

Anthony Rotundo has written the book, American Manhood, to show the historical development of the concept of manhood throughout the nineteenth century in order to understand, to a certain extent, the idea of manhood within our own historical time.  He focuses on a very narrow group of men for this study: Northern, white Yankees of middle and upper class pretensions.  This is an influential group for this period but it does feel that the entire picture of the changes evident in American manhood at the beginning of the twentienth century might have been better understood by including a knowledge of different forms of manhood that were emerging from the burgeoning immigrant population.  That being said this study is an important and necessary one to begin the further work needed on this topic and Mr. Rotundo provides many unique and important insights on this topic.  An interesting book and a good beginning for more work on the gender politics involved in changing ideas of masculinity.	2000-12-02

Bedini is a fun book although it does not quite deliver the promise of the subtitle on the cover.  It is not really about the journey of an elephant from deep in India to the heart of Rome.  It is really about the strange workings of Rome and the Papacy in the early 1500's and their dealings with other nations, such as Portugal from which the ill-fated elephant, Hanno, arrives.  The author uses a great variety of sources for this journey, particulary interesting being the use made of contemporary artists to provide proof of events.  This book could have used the Pope's elephant for a much wider glimpse of the world at this point in time, but the more narrow version presented here is fascinating and illuminating in its own right.  An interesting footnote into history (and, truly, how many interesting footnotes does one run across).	2000-12-02

Romm is to learn that for the ancients, geography was more of a literary device than a budding science.  In a way, it was more complex than that as the lines between literature and science were often blurred.  It is interesting to note that the idea of the edge of the earth was most often used to create a moral lesson and what a better well to draw a taste of moral water from than the area where the least information is available.  It was a blank slate of sorts for the ancient historians, geographers, philosophers and various other writers to create their own messages for their own purposes.  And in that the variety lies the pleasure in this short, readable look at the times of ancient Rome and Greece.	2000-11-30

Bowler's The Earth Encompassed is a survey of the environmental sciences from ancient times until the 1960's and 70's, with emphasis on the nineteenth century in geology and evolutionary theories.  Mr. Bowler covered much of the same evolutionary ideas in his book, Life's Splendid Drama, concerning the persistence of other ideas in opposition to Darwin's materialistic ideas on evolution. This was a contrast to the usually presented idea of Darwin's immediate triumph. The Earth Encompassed is a better read for the non-specialist (such as myself) before tackling the much tougher book, not the order I took the books unfortunately.  The Earth Encompassed is a very good survey that I was able to keep up with without any real background in the environmental sciences.  A fascinating aspect of the book was to see the ways in which scientists in the past did not (or could not) separate their science from their beliefs, whether political or religious, and that all science occurs in a social environment of which the scientist will be an integral part. A good beginning book on a complex subject.	2000-11-29

The book is not as accessible as it is claimed by some to be.  I have a bit of background in classical studies and I needed every scrape of it to plow through this book.  The historical framework necessary to understand what the Athenians were passionate about was never given and would have been a help for the non-classical studies buff.  In the end, this book is definately worth the ride and the reader will appreciate the struggle.  A very intelligent book that requires much from the reader but will also deliver even more back.	2000-11-29

It is important to view the stone age peoples with more open minds than is usually done and this book could be a good place to begin that examination.  The only serious flaw of this book, and it sometimes could be quite grating, was the author's insistence on building up his case by dramatically overemphasing the importance and achievements of these ancestors of ours.  Any evidence, however spurious, was included.  It felt, at times, that the author felt that unless he proved that the stone age peoples were, in fact, superior to all other peoples that followed he had not fulfilled his mission.  The book became a competition instead of simply a way of presenting the facts of the stone age and allowing their own achievements to stand.  It was an interesting read, although at times it could be quite frustrating.	2000-11-29

He has a strong opinion of the ways in which the papacy has betrayed his personal sense of Catholicism over the years and he expertly and effectively uses history to bolster many of his points.  Garry Wills is a good writer and a devilish historian so the web he weaves is strong and alluring.  It is only one side of the argument but it has probably never been presented so well, hence the angry responses this book will evocate.  It you are in agreement with Garry Wills, you will be delighted by this book and use many of these same arguments yourself.  Garry Wills is not anti-Catholic but he does speak out against a papacy that is not addressing the concerns of many of members.  <br />Beyond all the controversy of this book, it is a wonderfully entertaining read that strings together themes from the past two centuries of papal history.  A joy.	2000-11-29

She creates a tapestry of a time focusing on the extremes, whether politically right or left or rich or poor. The spectre (and inevitablility) of the First World War hangs over the entire epoch.  Ms. Tuchman portrays a world hurtling toward conflict fueled by its own excesses.  What allows her to get away with more than most historians would attempt is her marvelous writing and her unerring selection of facts to both shock the reader (particulary with specific quotes and small incidences) and move the reader to a belief in a society that is doomed to collapse on itself.  It is a daring approach that suceeds marvelously.  I have read and reread Ms. Tuchman and she always delights.	2000-11-25

I was able to understand the workings of codes much better than expected beacuase of his clear explanations and was a only lost when it came to quantum cryptography.  Even here, though, Mr. Singh was very able in holding my interest through the way he weaved in the personal stories of the cryptographers.  In fact, this book is as much about the cryptographers as it is about crpytography and that, in the end, is the book's marvelous charm.  Anyone who can make this subject so entertaining to a non-logical, math-hating reader such as myself has wrought a miracle. A very impressive, highly recommended book.	2000-11-24

There are many interesting facts throughout this book. One of its great joys is picturing a reader, like yourself, in earlier times and imagining them prowling through a bookshop set up in an entirely different fashion than is done in a bookstore now (and that is not even taking into account such places as ... where there are no book shelves for the reader to see).  The only drawback to the book is that sometimes the writing and the subject can be a little dry and grow stale, particulary as the story goes on.  Still, it is filled with much interesting information.	2000-11-23

This reaches the same high benchmark set by the previous books in terms of the width and breadth covered by the topic and the immense readability of its style.  The limited sources create more of a problem than when Weir covered the Tudors or the Wars of the Roses in her previous (marvelous) books but she still manages to pull all the pieces together and present a portrait of a woman who grew into her power and prestige over the years.  This book is neither hagiography or bitchography (not a word, per se, but descriptive enough of many writers take on Eleanor over the years).  Alison Weir's Eleanor was a woman who lived in and was of her political times.  To state that she was wife to two kings and mother to two others is to say a lot but that is only scratching the surface of this marvelous woman who was a power in her own right with her own land.  A  good book on an amazing woman that also captures the times and personalities occuring throughout her story.  Context is everything in biography and Alison Weir successfully achieves that.	2000-11-22

As a fan of all things historical, it is always a pleasure to discover a writer who looks at history from a different angle from most mainstream authors.  Parenti has a viewpoint and shouts it loudly and proudly.  Since all history writers have a bias of some kind, it is nice to read a book that wears its bias on its sleeve.  He is far left.  That could pose a problem for some readers who are so firmly entrenched to the right but for others it is a delight to travel with Parenti as he examines the ways history is manipulated by the ruling elite for their own benefit.  This book, whether you agree with it or not, will make you question other historians as you read them.  That is a very good thing.  This book opened my mind a little (and along with the History on Trial, as a companion piece) allowed me to examine with insight the history that I have been spoon fed in the past and the history books I will enter into in the future. An entertaining read from an angry (with every reason to be so) book.	2000-11-21

This book is filled with much fun facts on death, disease and extinctions (among other gloomy subjects) yet it is completely and morbidly fascinating.  I will even confess to not browsing through it as strongly recommended by the title but instead launching myself into it and reading it from cover to cover.  It brought me back to my heady childhood days glued to such founts of wisdom as the Book of Lists and the People's Almanac.  The humour in the book was also a delighful suprise (and a much needed release from all of the doom and gloom). A fun time was had by all.	2000-11-20

It is all penis all the time.  She covers every aspect of the penis in all its wondrous forms.  She will shock and delight and make you giggle or squirm (particulary if are already an owner of one of those penii).  It is a perfect bathroom book.  The only problem, in the end, is that each of the little sections are short and provide no depth and are easily forgetten.  After awhile there is a sameness to the book (for obvious reasons) that, perhaps, mirrors its subject.  Maybe if one does see enough (or read enough about them) every penis does appear the same and they lose their mysterious magic.  Still, a fun read that dissappears in a puff of smoke as quickly as the words depart.	2000-11-19

It was interesting to see how much the Southeners and the Northeners had in common in political and ecomonic outlook.  The average slaveholder was a grasping capitilist continually on the move and trying to advance himself.  Slaves were a commodity to be used in this regard, as were the slaveholders' democratic politics and the expansion south and westward in the United States.  The paternalist image built up in mythology after the Civil War existed but it was not representative.  This book is effective is demonstrating the ways in which the slaves were an active, often rebellious, factor in this capititist drama as they also rejected any paternalist notion of their enslavement and saw the truth of the picture.  They were a commodity both for labour and commerce.  The book is excellant in portraying a complicated picture of the slaveholding class that involved many people of different ethnic, religious, political, and economic backgrounds all bound up in a capitilist explotiation of the slaves as a source of upward mobility in a very fluid society.  A good place to begin to learn about this period of history.	2000-11-16

There are a few suspenseful moments, but very few, and the there is really no mystery to much of the story.  The bad guys are the bad guys and the good guys are the good guys and except for possibly one incidence of cross dressing, nothing that is revealed will be a surprise to the reader.  I do think the author did not intend any surprises, merely a plot to hang her crazy characters upon.  Having said that, if you already love Campion and his friends, you will love this book.  For those looking for a myster, it could prove a dissappointment.	2000-11-16

This is not said to be derogatory.  In many ways, that is the charm of the book.  It is light, easy to read, and filled with many, many facts.  There are too many facts coming at the reader to remember them all or to learn them.  Instead, the reader will come away with the general knowledge of how important place-names are to a culture and how other cultures will view a place and give it a name of their own.  Naming a place to some extent is a control issue and the struggle for control is an ever-changing idea.  But even these ideas are too heavy to be sustained in this light book.  This book is meant to read quickly and enjoyed throughout.  It is cotton candy, sweet to taste but light on substance with a carnival happening just on the outskirts of the reader's eye.	2000-11-10

Gilfoyle's City of Eros looks at New York City in its &quot;century of prostitution&quot;, roughly from 1820 to 1920.  He gives much more than a narrative history (although certainly many personalities and stories do shine through) as he looks at the broader picture and includes a taste of nineteenth sociology, a dash of its politics, and a smidgen of its literature and culture as it pertains to sex.  Through the entire book, the most strongly drawn character becomes New York City itself as the reader is almost invited to see a city that is teeming with commercial sex throughout the entire island of Manhattan.  The commercialization of sex, despite the efforts of vice puritans, changes more because the city changes.  It was interesting to see the commercialization of sex tied in with other forms of commerical enterprise.  A fitting companion to this book would be The Murder of Helen Jewett by Patricia Cline Cohen.  Read Timothy Gilfoyle's book for the broader picture and Patricia Cohen's for some of the finer, more personal details.  A wonderful read with much information.	2000-11-09

It is much more the story of the latter rather than the former.  An important book on the influenza pandemic and its historical impact is waiting to be written.  This book, though, still has its value both as a fun read of scientific discovery and some very inept amateur bungling, as well as an interesting look at the politics behind science.  The author is also very good at capturing the personalities behind the events.  No important conclusions are drawn and no important theories of history are defended but this book is a wonderful examination of a process in science. A delightful read.	2000-11-07

It would be foolish to spend much looking at the points where his thesis may fail instead of spending more time marveling at the mighty achievement he did accomplish. Of course, taking such a large chunk of history and creating a theory to explain all of its shifts will not always be a perfect but it is wonderful to see just how much of history can be explained by his wonderfully all-encompassing ideas.  With the soul of a scientist, Jared Diamond has created a wonderful synthesis to explain the development of writing, agriculture, conquest, disease and many, many other factors. Historians may balk at the largeness of such ideas, not seen Karl Marx found a convenient explanation for all human history, but it is a wonderful book to read, whether it is delighting or frustrating.  It gives the reader much to think about and hopefully allows a new perspective to blossom among all of one's older, inherited ideas.  A marvelous book.	2000-11-06

Begiebing's The Strange Death of Mistress Coffin is ostensibly a murder mystery but that is not the true delight of the story.  The basic story is that of the investigation of the murder of a young woman found naked in a river in 1648 New England by Richard Browne.  Onto this basic mystery-thriller narrative is attached the tale of Puritan New Englanders living and surviving in an hostile territory with all their beliefs and superstitions tested, preserved and adapted.  The characters are vivid and the writing is both moody and evocative.  It was a joy to read and it does truly transport the reader to a different time.  It is also a pleasure that the author never resorts to black and white portrayals.  Everything and everyone is vividly complex.  The mystery, whodunit, element per se is not the strongest element in the book but it is an effective hook to initially capture the reader and take her into this fascinating world.	2000-11-05

It is an important book in providing the background details of the industry and also in its portraits of the creators of the various comic books. For one such as myself, who grew up in the middle part of this period, it combines a delightful mix of nostalgia with a healthy mix of cynicism for the business side of this industry.  I was surprised that the twists and turns within the industry could often match for interest the myriad of confusing sub-plots that were being developed within the pages of the comics themselves.  I was also pleased at the examination the authors provided of the fictional heroes themselves, even including the authors, at times, strong opinions.  The book felt like a dialogue late at night with another expert fan of comics with often heated disagreements but always with a lot of fun and much insight.  A highly recommended read.	2000-11-04

The author uses this case to examine nineteenth-century attitudes towards incest, including a look at the Byron - Harriet Beecher Stowe incident.  There is also much discussion of life on the frontier, the court martial system in the army at the time, and an interesting discourse concerning the concept of viriginity.  The book has many interesting detours such as these and they are necessary as the main story is not always as interesting or as siginificant to sustain a full book.  All of the various pieces do come together to create a pleasant read.	2000-11-03

That, though, is a very high benchmark.  This novel covers less of an historical period than the first book and occasionaly some of the battle descriptions cut into the flow of gossip as history, much as they also do in Tacitus.  That said, all the wonderful themes and many of the characters (well, the few not poisoned at any rate) from the first book appear to shock and delight.  Robert Graves takes the fun and bitchy parts of the classical historians and makes them come to life.  His most endearing creation will always be the character of Claudius himself.  These books together are a joy for anyone with either a love of history or a need to hear salacious gossip (and often these are two are the same thing).  Highly recommended.	2000-11-02

They combine an historical perspective looking at events in America with a comparative approach to politics in other countries where Socialism influenced the political life.  The book is thorough and well researched and should set an example for an approach to the subject.  There are times that it does become repetitive in presenting a point repeatedly and much of the book is not as fascinating as the first and concluding chapters where a whole range of ideas are presented in a more general fashion.  This book, though, is ideal for the reader with an interest in comparative politics who desires an in-depth look at left wing politics in connection with unions, immigrants and American exceptionalism (an idea that is in some ways showing a bit of decline as the rest of the world becomes politically more similar to the United States).  The intellectual effort getting through this book does eventually pay off.	2000-11-01

Both these characters are wonderful but the real joy is found in the stories told by all the people they encounter.  Each person has a story and each time people meet they, along with the reader, have the opportunity to learn something.  The stories are all fascinating, some horrifying and most touching.  They are spun together nicely.  It is to the author's credit, as well, that interest in the two main characters does not diminish throughout the book, particulary the character of the powerfully written Ada.  A wonderful way of looking at America in the Civil War period from many different perspectives.	2000-11-01

It is history writ small.  The horrors and corruption of a society under the heel of apartheid are shown effectively in this story of one family.  It is a coming of age story that is both personal to the child and emblematic of the society around that child.  <br />This novel is excellant at showing an historical period in a way that a book of history never could.  Mark Behr makes the society feel real, and is all the more chilling for having done so.  It is the small quiet moments that truly are the most shocking and that is how it should be. An excellant novel about a time and place of which more people should be aware.	2000-10-25

Nash, Charlotte Crabtree, and Ross E. Dunn have written a fascinating book that looks at the problems which occur when politics and the teaching history clash, as they inevitably will.  The specific event described is the fight over the National History Standards which were established to give states and local school boards voluntary guidelines.  The idea blew up when Lynne Cheney wrote an op-ed piece damning the standards.  All three authors were involved in the project and bring their personal views and insights to the book in a helpful way.<br />The most interesting aspect of the book is both the historical and international aspects applied to the history wars. It allows the reader to put this recent battle into a more helpful historical perspective as many examples from the past are presented.  The examples from the other countries are also useful in giving a global approach to the issues.  This is how it should be for a book that covers the battles over what should be taught to children concerning U.S. and world history.  A good book that shows the problems that begin when politicians get involved in the teaching of history.	2000-10-24

And that is a very good thing.<br />One of the main joys of this novel is having history become personal.  This is not a adventure story about the Titanic but rather a small novel of the personal lives of various people which gets interrupted by the disaster at sea.  Those looking for big cinematic thrills are advised to look elsewhere.  But those looking for a glimpse of a group of interesting characters just before a life changing event will enjoy this tale.<br />The other joy of this novel is the compact, effective writing.  Dialogue and narrative are told with an elegant sparseness. A nice read.	2000-10-24

Her death occurred at a &quot;fairy trial&quot; when she was suspected of being a changeling and no longer the woman Bridget Cleary.  It ended in her death by burning and charges being brought against all the (Catholic) peasants present.<br />The bigger story presented throughout this book is the story of Ireland at this point in time.  The reader will learn much about Celtic folklore, the power of religion in people's lives, and, most importantly, the struggle for Irish nationalism that effected everyone's lives.  Sometimes the side stories may seem forced onto Bridget Cleary's own narrative but it all still provides for an interesting hodgepodge of Irish history.  A winding and long road of a read but always interesting.	2000-10-20

I was very excited, therefore, by the title of the book and the delights which it promised to offer.  I was dissappointed, unfortunately.  The author does state that he is not doing anything original, which is fine, but he should at least have found an original way to make this history seem fresh in its retelling.  The repetition of many of the anecdotes sometimes could make it seem that one was at faculty dinner party with a professor telling you the same story he had just told in class.  Also the longest chapter in the book, on Roman food, was neither scandolous nor about the Roman emperors but, even worse, was not particulary captivating. There were interesting elements to the book as the subject is so fascinating but it was not as well put together as I had antipacited based on its mouth watering title.	2000-10-16

He puts his ideological cards on the table in the introduction and then, if you have any spark of liberal spirit inside you, you go along for the ride as Irons takes the reader through over two hundred years of siginificant cases of the Supreme Court.  The great pleasure of this book is that it also allows the reader to see the personalities of both the court and the petitioners before the court.  Dred Scott becomes more than the name of the decision.  It is fascinating, too, how politics and legal decisions are weaved together in this epic book as they are in the actual decisions themselves.  It was a wonderful book that demonstrated that the Constitution is for the people and the story of the Constitution is the story of the people.	2000-10-08

This is a strategic period as the narratives changed from execution sermons to more secular, gothic-tainted narratives that, in turn, influenced the way we look at murder to this day.  This general look at this period is an excellant broad view of this period that can be enhanced by Patricia Cline Cohen's Murder of Helen Jewett and Amy Gilman Srebnick's The Mysterious Death of Mary Rogers, two significant murders from this period that demonstrated and influenced the changes that are part of Murder Most Foul. It is a fascinating period and interesting topic that is very well served by this book.  I can sadly see my own prurient interest in these accounts but it comforting to see some of it explained in a historical sense.	2000-10-04

In some ways, the story is almost author proof as it comes with a easily recoginizable set of personalities and a moment that changes everyone lives.  Fiction writers should have it so easy and that, in a way, is one of Stewart O'Nan's strengths.  He turns his fiction writing skills towards writing a piece of history and creates this thrilling narrative.  The bulk of the book is centred on that tragic day and we are led through the events with the help of some of the survivors and not a few of the victims.  The book also shows the readers the aftereffects of such a tragedy on the lives of the survivors and the circus itself.  This part of the story is presented in a manner that is as important and dramatic as the details of the actual fire. An exciting read.	2000-09-30

Each What If? scenario was written by a different historian.  They each handled the assignment so differently that there was no consistency to their approaches and styles.  Some of the writers, such as Geoffrey Parker, writing on the Spanish Armada created very believable scenarios that did not stray too far from the realm of the possible given the historical personas and circumstances. To enjoy some of the later scenarios would require more knowledge of each of the battles, such as all of the battles of the Civil War, than this particular reader possessed. At other times,  a particular author spent much time making the situation clear for the reader.  Writing these scenarios would assuredly have been fun for the historian, sometimes giving them room to grind an ideological axe, but this book was not always as consisently fun for the reader.  When it is was good, though, it was very good.	2000-09-27

It takes a slow approach.  First, it looks at the United States during this century and then it examines France in the same time period.  This is supposed to represent the modern West as France is the thinnest of the western countries and the United States the most obese and the book looks for a cultural explanation for this phenomemon.  It was slow going.  It could be because I was looking for a historical attack on body fascists (possibly to assuage guilt over my own body image) and that is certainly not with what the book is concerned.  The last two chapters are the best and bring the points made previously forward very clearly and, even, add what seem even more relevant arguments.  There are not very many hard statistics and the history of science is blended a litle too much with the history of culture but the book does make very interesting points.	2000-09-24

From the reviews from other readers I was not expecting much and was delighted that it was better than others have stated.  It is light pop history but manages to touche on family relations, politics, views of witchcraft, village life (and disputes), poverty, and religion in the telling the story of how Anne Gunther and her father faked possession and witchcraft.  This leads them (and the reader) from their small village to the court of King James I and then back again. A fun, light read.	2000-09-21

It is less about Nathaniel Courthope or even the island of Run, specifically, than the back  of the book description would allow the reader to believe.  It is none the  less thrilling for that. The narrative ranges all over the globe from  Russia, the arctic, Africa, Manhattan and India in order to tell the true  story centred on the Spice Islands.  Giles Milton is quite good at  selecting the right characters to personalize many of these unbelievalbe  incidents.  It is a weird story that builds as it goes along.  It took a  while to get interested in this crazy quilt approach but it pays off nicely  in this wonderful book.  A fun piece of pop history.	2000-09-19

The short format can not lead to anything substantial,  obviously, but Karen Armstrong has taken an effective approach to the work.   The first part of the book is basically a chronological history that  whisks the reader through almost fifteen hundred years of Islamic history.   It can be confusing if one, such as I, is encountering many of these names  and ideas for the first time.  It did make me want to search out more  specific books on Islam on certain of the people and topics that were of  particular interest through reading Ms. Armstong's book.  It is a good  overview.<br />The last part of the book borrows very heavily from Ms.  Armstrong's books, including the wonderful Battle for God.  If you have  read her other books, the ideas will be familiar to you.  If not, you will  probably find something new to think about.  It is interesting to have a  narrative history tied to a well-written selection of essays that amount to  an intelligent plea for understanding of other traditions.  This is a  wonderful book that provides a good beginning for a look at Islam, with a  well-chosen bibliography to lead the reader to a fuller understanding of  this many varied topic.	2000-09-16

Books looking at messianic beliefs  through history seem to be a burgeoning market.  A better one covering the  same material is Norman Cohn's The Pursuit of the Millenium. As well, there  are books that cover a very specific part of the picuture, such as Michael  Barkun's Religion and the Rascist Right, examining British-Isrealism and  Christian Identity.  Part of the charm of Messianic Revolution is its  looseness in defining radical religious politics.  It often seems the  authors include an idea or group simply because it interests them and then  they shoe horn it gently into the narrative.  This may not make for a  authoritative book but it does keep the story and subject interesting and  should lead the reader to read more on this subject.	2000-09-12

It was amazing to see how mesmerism  touched on such Victorian concepts as gender relations, the emergence of  science and medicine as a profession, and class relations.  The chapters on  mesmerism and colonial India, and the effect of the idea on mesmerism in  changing the image of the homebound invalid were the most fascinating. All  the famous characters from this period appear somewhere in this vast study.   The metaphor seemed to stretch a little thin when reading and politics  were added to the mesmerisic mix near the end of the book, although this  was nevertheless very interesting.  A good book that makes me interested to  read more about this time period in Britain.	2000-08-28

Gotta love that costume, particulary odd looking when he is  trying to hide in the shadows with that gaudy delight of an outfit.<br />The  art is primitive and generally unimaginative and the stories also show as  little imagination, at the beginning at least.  They do grow a little more  imaginative in the portrayal of the use of his power (generally underused  considering what he must have been capable of doing).  He needed a powerful  and interesting villain, or two. Adding Doiby Dickles seemed to help spice  up the stories, though.<br />It was still wonderful reading these stories as I  had never seen a story with the original Green Lantern before the 1960's,  outside of his adventures alongside the Justice Society of America. An  interesting selection for the DC Archives Series.	2000-08-28

This seemed a fascinating combination for a book.   I was more impressed than I expected to be. It was a nice spin on the many  books that look at the period at the beginning of the AIDS crisis in that  the reader does not immediately see the connection. The initial talk of  gods and demigods and, god forbid, hemidemigods, sets one up for a  different sort of story.  One does not suspect that the story of the Fall  of Troy can be used to show the meaning of being gay in such a contemporary  way but that is the thrill of this novel.  Pyrrhus and Philoctetes were  superb choices to guide the reader through this novel but the joy also came  from the minor characters who pop up fully formed throughout the novel,  such as Admetus and Leucon.  Too many gay novels contain a hero that is a  beautiful and sexual god, in a metaphorical sense, that it is nice to see a  novel where the hero (almost) is a god in a literal sense but somehow  writtin all the more real for all of that.	2000-08-25

The author narrowly  focuses on the theological elements in this discussion for most of the book  and the how or why which made people believe these quite paranoid,  delusional or hate-filled things is left out of the discussion.  This book  is about what they believed and not why.  But that really would not fit  into this book (and would take several on its own account).  This book also  does not go beyond British Isrealism or the Christian Identity into other  ways in which the right, religion and rascism all connect.  But what this  book does cover, it does so masterfully and the research is impressive and  important. An read for anyone interested in the right wing fringes of  society in a &quot;know thy enemy&quot; sort of way.	2000-08-25

As  an alien in this city, it is wonderful to see how the idea of New York grew  out of this period.  This short book manages to touch on many, interrelated  topics showing how the death of Mary Rogers was used and manipulated by  many people for their own political or social purposes, while her life  before her death remained a mystery.  People interested in the early  history of the growth of abortion legislation would also be fascinated in  the ways in which this touchs Mary Roger's own death.  It is a fascinating  book that has already led me to others covering this period.	2000-08-17

There is too  often one character suddenly explaining at length everything around them  when it could have been more interesting for the characters, and the  reader, to slowly learn the secrets and be surprised themselves as books  from their childhood seem to be part of this underworld conspiracy.  It was  not always clear how these Egyptian legends could have been transformed  into such a wide variety of children's booksm, either.  It was entertaining  and a fast, pleasurable read, but it could have been so much more.	2000-08-17

There was a British bias but it helped to frame the book and  there were many side journeys to other nations to keep this journey  fascinating.<br />What was most interesting was how the various women used  being women to their advantage as well as how their enemies also used their  femaleness against them. Antonia Fraser weaves all these women together but  clearly presents their differences.  They are all linked by being women but  it is shown how that very similarity can be so differently used and  percieved by all these various warriors.  The inidivduals that come out of  this story are unique and interesting. It is these vivid brief portraits  that carry this book along.  Well done.	2000-08-11

The hero kept sinking  deeper and deeper and I wanted to shout at him, &quot;Get out of the  school&quot; as this main character failed to see the true nature of the  danger building around him. It was frustrating, yet gripping.  The reader  was shown the danger and the some of the evil schemes swirling around the  New Hampshire campus. Gossip was never true or innocent and the paranoia  was always well-place. A spooky combination.  The usual entrenchmant of  bureacracy against any change was presented and it felt real for anyone who  has worked in an institution of any kind and then this was nudged forward  just a little until it became deadly.<br />The number of interesting  characters, good and bad, was a nice change from some suspense novel that  spend their written energy on usually simply the hero or the villain.<br />It  felt nice to settle down with a killer and a New Hampshire snowstorm on a  hut, muggy New York day.	2000-08-11
