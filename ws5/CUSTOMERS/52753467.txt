Secondly, there are LOTS of small color photographs, which is nice, though they are necessarily small. The front and back covers fold out to maps of the city and the metro system, and a selected street index.  The book is organized into \\"top ten\\" lists: attractions, Modernista buildings, squares, churches, museums, cafes, restairants and tapas bars, night-time spots, gay & lesbian hangouts, shopping areas, markets, city views, parks & beaches, walks and bike rides, activities, attractions for children, folk festivals, and performance venues.  In the next section, top ten lists are given for each geographic section of the city, and the lists mix resteraunts, attractions, etc.  The final section, called \\"Streetsmart\\", gives top ten helpful hints for:  getting to barcelona, getting around the city, ways to explore, tours, information sources, security, health, banking, eating, shopping, budget travel and hotels.  Each list is accompanied by a map or graphic and each item gets a few descriptive sentences and includes hours, prices and metro stop information.  The book concludes with an incomplete index and some useful phrases.<br /><br />We found this guide pretty useful and compact, and would definitely use others in the series when travelling.	2005-09-15

This was not the best, but it was useful and I would use it again.<br /><br />This little book starts with an 8-page introduction tot he city, which was interesting, and continues with short sections devoted to attractions organized by type (parks, churches, etc) where each listing contains metro, hours and price information.<br /><br />We used several of the little walking tours in the book and they were good, but in general the book was not organized enough to be truly handy.  It did have more detailed sections on shopping and sports than other guides, however, if that is of interest to you.  Covers include fold-out maps which list main streets.	2005-09-15

The book is divided in half, first a Catalan to English section and then English to Catalan section, which lists words alphabetically and includes the part of speech and the counter-word, but little else.  There is no pronunciation key, which is really important for the Catalan language.  Neither were there any phrases or sections of particular use to the traveller. In Barcelona, we found that most people spoke a little English or were able to use Spanish, so we didn't use this dictionary at all.  We used smaller books that contained travel phrases and gave some hint to pronunciation instead.	2005-09-15

The book begins with about 20 pages of general introduction to Barcelona and then gives 5 walks, separated by area:  El Barri Gottic, Sant Pere and La Ribera, El Raval, Gracia and L'Eixample.  Each walk takes about 3 to 4 hours (longer if you stop at recommended restaurants and attractions), and are as good as having a private walking tour.  There are lots of interesting little stories about the city, the buildings and the people.  We've used many of the books in this series and found BarcelonaWalks not quite as intimate and charming as others, but still very good.  Also the book is getting older now so it is less reliable when it comes to restaurants and other venues, but we still enjoyed these walks very much.  Each section contains a map (which does not name all the streets, which can be problematic) and a few balck-and-white photographs.	2005-09-15

The city is divided into six sections, each with short descriptions of several attractions and restaurants, and each with a fol-out map to that section.  These maps were included metro stops, street names and the places listed, and were augmented by small color photographs.  Attraction and restaurant listings include hours, prices and telephone numbers/  The front and back covers fold-out also and give general and metro information and some hotel listings.  We found this little guide to be fairly useful, but particularly liked the maps.	2005-09-15

Really?  have you ever known ANYONE who was 40 but looked 20?  Ten years younger I could believe, but twenty?  And that was the problem with this book for me -- it is certainly not terrible, but it always goes just a bit too far in what it asks the reader to believe.  Let's see, Ally's been celibate for 15 years, but suddenly she is in love with a married symphony conductor whom she's never met, and now she does any number of unusual things in order to get him.  Ouch.<br /><br />Characters were well developed, the ending was well done and it is a quick read, so this is not terrible, but I'd recommend you borrow it from your local library rather than purchase it.<br /><br />if you're interested in a librarian protagonist, check out Larry Beinhart's The Librarian instead, a political thriller.	2005-08-23

Though I found it unusually disjointed, it is probably much more palatable when it is performed, and what still compelled me to give it my highest rating is the content, being the many outrageous and surreal statements made by W, Rumsfeld, Cheney, Powell, Blair, et al, as well as depictions of meetings and events, all gathered together in one place, which really helps you appreciate the systematic deception presented to the American and British people.  In the Author's Note, Hare states that most events and quotes are authentic, and he thanks his sources.  My guess is that he received a great deal of help/material/insight from Colin Powell, whose recollection of events is of interest.  A quick but chilling read.	2005-08-23

He has a distinctive style and a distinctive wit, which is informed here by Orwellian nightmares as our \\"hero\\", Winston, not only copes with fickle neopostmodernism but embraces it.  It is a thoroughly depressing vision of the future, but somehow it is funny too.  So perhaps Ted Rall is part of the problem -- getting us to laugh instead of fight as we enter the slaughterhouse gates?  Yes.  No.  Whatever.	2005-08-23

I stayed up reading until 5 am and then woke up three hours later to finish it.  That hasn't happened to me in years.<br /><br />David Goldberg is a university librarian working part-time for an elderly conservative billionaire whose co-conspirators are worried that Goldberg will find evidence of their plans to steal the presidential election.<br /><br />With shifting viewpoints, Beinhart does a great job of capturing the mindset of a librarian, with his literary allusions and idealistic worldview, as well as the many crazies out to get him.  There is an Oliver North/Gordon Liddy goon, an amoral Secretary of State reminiscent of Dick Cheney and a Supreme Court justice on the take.  On the good guy's side -- quirky librarians out of their element as violent thugs begin to move in.  Librarians are, by definition, at least a little idealistic which, in these corrupt times, puts them at a bit of a disadvantage; but they are also bright truth-seeking information technologists, so they're not exactly helpless either, and the confrontations between the two groups are believable in this fictional account.<br /><br />Beinhart has a disconcerting talent for making sense of present and past  political machinations, harkening back to Ronald Reagan, Ken Starr and the 2000 election as well as our current crop of ne'er-do-wells, positing plausible surmises about what their motives and actions are.<br /><br />I hope this gets made into a movie, as the author's American Hero was.  Part of the fun is trying to decide who will play the various parts.<br /><br />One character I found particularly interesting was Hagopian, the Democratic candidate's political and media guru.  I'm not sure who the real-life counterpart would be, but would love to know.<br /><br />The verbal description of the president is absolutely hysterical and point after point deliciously skewers hypocritical chicken hawks and government employees who bash the government at every turn, including a \\"pugnacious pest exterminator\\"!  It is wonderfully funny, though the fact that it is largely true also makes it infuriating.<br /><br />The dedication to librarian Larry Berk, \\"whom God has mistaken for Job\\", was intriguing, particularly when Berk appears briefly in the book.<br /><br />I thought the ending was a bit unsatisfactory (it wrapped up too quickly and we didn't hear from candidate Murphy or guru Hagopian in the last third of the book) and it could have used a better proofreading, but this book brought me hours of pleasure.  I had to make a real effort not to read too many passages aloud to my husband so he can enjoy it on his own.<br /><br />Highly recommended.ical chicken hawks and government employees who bash the government at every turn, including a \\"pugnacious pest exterminator\\"!

As the book starts, it is presumed that Aloysius Pendergast is dead, though he communicates from the grave to contact his compadre Vincent, and asks him to carry on the search for Pendergast's evil brother Diogenes, who has promised to commit the perfect crime in one week's time.  Furthermore, Pendergast's friends are being murdered in extraordinary ways, and D'Agosta is convinced they are also connected to Diogenes -- which means he and the other characters are in danger.  As this main story unfolds, we are also made aware that a big show is coming up at the Museum of Natural History and that controversy surrounds it.<br /><br />Preston and Child are talented authors, and the book moves quickly as chapters jump among the many characters, even as their situations draw them more closely together.  I found the in-jokes fun though others may not.  And while this volume brings together characters from various books, it's well done and I enjoyed that as well.<br /><br />While it's a bit annoying to be left with a cliffhanger that means you must wait another year to find out what happens to these people, the story is good (though not as thrilling or as moody as previous efforts) and the wait will be rewarded.	2005-08-03

Satrapi uses a simple (but not simplistic) black and white style that is quite expressive as she tells the story of her life after returning to her home in post-Revolution Iran from schools in Europe.  The book details the difficulties she faced as a woman and as a citizen, and continues through her marriage.<br /><br />Enlightening and entertaining.  Highly recommended.	2005-06-07

I've read other graphic novels and compared to them the illustrations here are more stark but equally rewarding; Satrapi uses a simple (but not simplistic) black and white style that is quite expressive as she tells the story of life before, during and after the 1979 Revolution that changed life in Iran for so many people.<br /><br />Fearing for her safety, her parents send her to school in Europe, and the author does a wonderful job of articulating her maturation as an individual and as a citizen of a tumultuous country.  Persepolis 2 details her experiences when she returns to her homeland as a young woman.<br /><br />Enlightening and entertaining.	2005-06-07

Though dated (published in 1982), this is an affectionate look at the history of individually wrapped candy bars, told in short chapters telling the story both chronologically and regionally.  There are lots of illustrations of candy bars, wrappers, displays and ads, with an eight-page center section of color advertisements.<br /><br />This fun book concludes with an informative list of more candy manufacturers; an interesting peek at the 1981 National Candy Buyers Bar Survey; the author's 20 favorites; and photo credits.  The book really suffers from the lack of an index, but is so much fun I can't bring myself to reduce the star rating.	2005-05-26

Stephanie Barron captures Austen's technique better than any other imitator,, and her books are interesting in their own right, being the rather extraordinary adventures of a Georgian spinster.<br /><br />It is the autumn of 1808 in Southampton, where Jane and her mother and friend currently reside.  Jane's sister-in-law Elizabeth has just died and the family is in mourning.  Nearby the impressive ruins of Netley Abbey casts a sinister air over events as a mysterious, and perhaps treasonous, widow moves into the local manse and befriends Jane, who likes the woman despite Lord Harold Trowbridge's cautions.  Yes, dear Lord Harold figures prominently in this story, which I always enjoy.<br /><br />SO, the story is fun, the history is interesting to Anglophiles, and Barron's writing is superb.  What's not to enjoy?	2005-05-25

Throughout the twelve books, the author has pinned his stories to the legendary exploits of a series of warrior mice, and this instalment finally tells us the story of Luke, who was the father of Martin, Redwall's legendary original protector.<br /><br />As usual, the tale is filled with colorful descriptions of the various animals and their speech and habits -- particularly the food they eat!  (Also as usual, and what makes the series inappropriate for the youngest children, there is a lot of description of the criminal element and their vicious actions.)<br /><br />If you're a fan of this series, you will thoroughly enjoy learning about Luke.  If you are new to the series, you can still enjoy this book, which I would recommend to t hose who enjoy fantasy novels.<br /><br />A great addition to the series.	2005-05-05

The reader is treated to an interesting plot involving a king's ransom stolen in Wales, as well as the development of the de Quincy character.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading about Wales and the politics of the region at the time.

We learn a lot about this, his family, and his opinions about politics today in this series of very funny essays covering topics such as 9/11, corporate corruption, Henry Kissinger, the Clintons, activism, Dennis Miller, comedy, Reagan, Air America Radio, NPR, the Iraq War, etc.  Scattered between the essays are one-liners  (e.g. Bush says he is eating beef and isn't vaguely concerned about the possibility of mad cow disease.  Of course he isn't--the disease attacks the brain.)<br /><br />If you're a progressive, there are lots of lines that will make you nod or smile or laugh. Conservatives will not enjoy this, but all others will.	2005-04-05

He eats it every day, he stores it, he seeks out rarities, he jabbers on to his friends about it, and he writes about it with passion and wit.<br /><br />While some readers may be disappointed that the author inserts so much of his own life and opinions into the material, if you read this as a memoir framed around candy it works very well.  I would have liked to have seen even more candy mentioned, like the Black Cow and Triple Decker Bars I remember so fondly, but I thoroughly enjoyed this passionate account of the author's travels to meet (and get free candy from) small candy manufacturers all around the country.<br /><br />I learned a lot about the candy business and its history in the US, and as someone who trick-or-treated until I was 18, I laughed out loud at his account of the annual candy orgy.<br /><br />Also impressive is the author's descriptions of actually eating candy, which are spot on.  For example, when comparing two similarly formulated bars, Almond writes,<br /><br />\\"The chocolate in the 100 Grand is mild and crumbly.  The crisped rice is mealy and deflated ... and the balance is all wrong.  There simply isn't enough chocolte or crisped rice to sustain the salivary breakdown....<br /><br />\\"The Caravelle tasted more like a pastry: the chocolate was thicker, darker, full-bodied, and the criped rice had a malty flavor and what I want to call structural integrity; the caramel was that rarest variety, dark and lustrous and supple, with hints of fudge.  More so, there was a sense of the piece yielding to the mouth.  By which I mean, one had to work the teeth through the sturdy chocolate shell, which gave way with a distinct, moist snap, through the crisped rice (thus releasing a second, grainy bouquet), and only then into the soft caramel core.  Oh, that inimitable combination of textures!\\"<br /><br />Wow!  And that's about a candy bar he hasn't tasted in years.  THAT'S devotion!  I really enjoyed the author's visits with other candy afficiionados and candy makers, and his descriptions of their passion as well as the various candymaking processes.<br /><br />This book is more than I expected and a terrific read that I would recommend to any candy lover.<br /><br />The author also includes a few web sites.ed the author's visits with other candy afficiionados and candy makers, and his descriptions of their passion as well as the various candymaking processes. <br /> <br />This book is more than I expected and a terrific read that I would recommend to any candy lover.  <br /> <br />The author also includes a few web sites.	2005-04-05

Of course we know more than Fallon does at any given point, and are privy to the history of an unknown Shakespeare manuscript, Love's Labours Won, which in turn is intimately tied to the history of Harvard University.<br /><br />Martin is a fine writer, and if you're interested in Harvard, rare books or a good mystery, you will find much to recommend this novel.  I think the last couple of chapters are a bit muddled and the story loses its momentum as the intellectual puzzle becomes a foot chase, but I still enjoyed this fine novel, and learned a lot about Harvard too, and would recommend it to others.	2005-04-05

The mystery s good -- I thought I had it figured out, but didn't.<br /><br />The character of Jane is a bit too action-oriented to be plausible, but the book is still enjoyable.

I thought the story was good, though with the espionage subplot it was also unnecessarily busy, and there were lots of interesting characters.  Celeste is the daughter of Blythe hall's gardener, sent off to learn to be a governess partly to keep her away from the younger son, Ellery, who she has a crush on.  When Celeste returns after four years to be governess to the manor's children, she is determined to capture Ellery, and she has a good chance, given her beauty and the polish she acquires in Paris.  Ellery's older brother is determined that the roguish Ellery will go through with his marriage to the rich and titled Hyacinth, so he decides to seduce Celeste himself.  THAT'S when things begin to go wrong!<br /><br />This is a fun read with interesting characters doing believable things, and I would read another book by this author.	2005-04-05

The author, a cognitive scientist at Berkeley, discusses how liberals and conservatives frame, or label and discuss, various issues, and how that framing affects voters.  Using many real-world examples, he also gives straightforward advice on how to REframe issues and how to discuss political topics in a way that will reach those with an open mind.<br /><br />This is a valuable guide for those of us who want to change the political dialogue in this country.	2005-04-05

I enjoy reality television and Nick Hornby, to whom comparisons have been made, but I thought this book was neither interesting nor particularly well written.  While the premise is terrific, a schlump creating a more interesting character to get onto a reality show, the execution was lame.  Joseph and his alter-ego Jeb are almost indistinguishable, and neither is likable (nor terribly interesting).  Also, there should have been a rich stock of reality-tv stereotypes, but the people \\"Jeb\\" encounters are one-dimensional and too much alike.  The ending is goofy and not too believable, and the book in general is too anemic even to rise to being considered angst-ridden.<br /><br />Just my opinion, but this was a really tedious read, and certainly not in the same league as Nick Hornby.	2005-02-23

Though not much is known about Vermeer's life, we learn a fair amount  about his techniques and the influences from which he drew.  I found it extremely impressive and useful that when the author mentioned another artist or a painting that Vermeer knew, these were also pictured, so that I really learned a great deal about this fascinating artist's time as well.<br /><br />All of Vermeer's paintings are shown, as are the works of other artists, and these are reproduced in color in combination with intelligent, informative notes.<br /><br />Extremely well done, with beautiful color reproductions of each painting, this volume would be a bargain at double the price!	2005-01-05

The author and his wife are venture capitalists who were convinced that corporate-owned media were unwilling to cover stories such as Prescott Bush's (W's grandfather) collaboration with the Nazis, and they were inspired to respond to the stranglehold of right-wing radio after Al Gore's \\"defeat\\" in the 2000 fiasco.<br /><br />The story of the beginning of Air America Radio is quite compelling, though the book suffers from repetitiveness and a lack of detail. This is definitely the story from Drobny's point-of-view, and it lacks interesting information that he was either not privy to or chose not to share. For instance, I was interested to know how and why the station started, but when it came to learning about how they found and negotiated with on-air talent, we get only a little information about Al Franken and nothing about anybody else! Also, there was a bit of a fiasco with early financial dealing, but we get only sketchy details from Drobny.<br /><br />As for content, while Mr. Drobny seems like a very nice fellow and an angel for the left, the book was unintentionally revealing regarding some of his weaknesses. On several occasions, we learn, the Drobnys were asked to give interviews to various networks about the new station, but they declined to do so, fearing that the story would get negative spin!! No wonder they had troube getting initial investors, when they were perpetually declining free publicity! Drobny spends a lot of time lamenting the difficulty in finding finanial backers, but it never seems to have occurred to him to have the station be a non-profit organization funded by contributors. I think a lot of people, myself included, would have donated generously to have a liberal radio station. Later, the management spent a fair amount of money having a PR firm decide on a name -- why not ask potential listeners to try their hand?<br /><br />Despite the flaws of the people who started the station and the weaknesses of the book, I fully support AAR and bless the Drobnys for getting it on the air. It's a terrific radio alternative, and it has kept me sane through the mire that is politics today.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Drobny!t ask potential listeners to try their hand?  <br /> <br />Despite the flaws of the people who started the station and the weaknesses of the book, I fully support AAR and bless the Drobnys for getting it on the air.

Mr. Trillin aims his barbs at Cheney's greed, Bush's (toughest hombre ever hid in the Guard) low IQ, Rove, Delay, war, fundamentalists and political campaigns, and the poems are insightful and sharp.  There are even a few sea chanteys (Let's Heave Ho Toward the Center, Lads)!, and sometimes the titles are the real punch line, as in \\"On the Bush Administration's Reversal of the Announcement that Testing School Lunch Meat for Salmonella Would No Longer Be Required\\" or \\"Richard Perle: Whose Fault Is He?\\", which ends :<br /><br />\\"And he's got planes and ships and tanks and guns--<br /><br />All manned, of course, by other people's sons.\\"<br /><br />The title comes from the first rhyme of the book,<br /><br />\\"Obliviousy on he sails,<br /><br /> With marks not quite as good as Quayle's\\"<br /><br />I thought the most biting was this one, called \\"A Silver Lining View of George Bush's Not Attending Military Funerals, Lest He Become Associated with Bad News\\":<br /><br />\\"At least there's no Bush eulogy<br /><br />On why they had to die.<br /><br />It's better that they're laid to rest<br /><br />Without another lie.\\"<br /><br />Fine, satirical poems with a liberal/moral/rational bias.	2005-01-04

While Thursday has her hands full with a variety of problems, her big enemy is Yorrick Kaine, head of the evil Goliath Corporation, who is determined to become president of the country -- and you know no good will come of that!<br /><br />I would not suggest you read the books out of order, so presumably you are familiar with the series and will know what to expect here -- Thursday is still trying to un-eradicate Landen, dealing with literary high-jinks (in this case Hamlet and Zhark), corraling pet dodos, acting as liaison to neanderthals and interacting with an eccentric family.  While I felt the novel lacked some of the creative energy of the first instalment, it was still fun and very entertaining.  I thought the ending was the best of the lot, quite emotional, and leaves the author the option of writing more Next volumes, or not.<br /><br />Fforde is a talented author and I look forward to reading whatever he decides to write.	2004-11-30

The first half takes up where the previous book left off, with Charlie, Grandpa Joe and Mr. Wonka in the glass elevator, and it quickly gets bizarre, but not necessarily in a good way.

Raphael and McLeish offer essential reading lists for 35 topics (with subcategories under Fiction and History), and I have found many many fine books based on their recommendations.<br /><br />The format is easy to use, with a paragraph or two of commentary followed by the list of recommended books.  Items are cross-referenced and annotated with symbols that denote works that are considered standard, seminal, a pleasure to read, difficult, recommended for beginners to the subject, containing a good bibliography, containing good illustratioins, etc.  There is a LOT of information packed in this slim volume, and while it will not be useful as a guide to popular fiction (since it was last published in 1988), it will be a magnificanet guide to the following subject areas:<br /><br />Anthropology<br /><br />Archaeology<br /><br />Architecture<br /><br />Art and Design<br /><br />Autobiography<br /><br />Biography<br /><br />Children's Books<br /><br />Diaries and Letters<br /><br />Drama<br /><br />Economics<br /><br />Feminism<br /><br />Fiction (Crime, Novels, Science Fiction and Short Stories)<br /><br />Film<br /><br />Food and Drink<br /><br />Geography and the Environment<br /><br />History (American; Ancient; Asian, African and Middle Eastern; Latin American; World)<br /><br />Home and Garden<br /><br />Humor<br /><br />Literary Criticism<br /><br />Mathematics, Science and Technology<br /><br />Media<br /><br />Medicine and Psychiatry<br /><br />Music<br /><br />Mythology<br /><br />Natural History<br /><br />Occult and Paranormal<br /><br />Philosophy<br /><br />Poetry<br /><br />Politics<br /><br />Psychology<br /><br />Reference<br /><br />Religion<br /><br />Sex and Love<br /><br />Sociology<br /><br />Travel and Exploration<br /><br />The book concludes with an author index.

I use the latter to gauge my trust in the former, and I have to say I was mildly disappointed with the lists about which I am knowledgable, such as Academic Satires and Historical Fiction, which neglected to mention essential authors and books.  That tells me that the other lists, those in which I have no first-hand knowledge, will probably get me started but will be neither authoritative nor complete.<br /><br />Secondly, I was not enamored of the format, which devotes approximately one page to each topic and is set up as commentary with book titles in bold face type.  There are a wide variety of topics, from Australian Fiction to Epistolary Novels and Pawns of History, however there is usually no information about the year of publication.  The general commentary is interesting but inconsistent, while the sentence devoted to each recommended work is helpful and informative, as if a friend in a hurry was telling you about the item.<br /><br />This is a fun book and it will get you started in areas of interest to you; however, for a more comprehensive and authoritative list there is The List of Books (sadly out-of-print and dated, but available used) by Frederic Raphael and Kenneth McLeish and, for a guide to specific authors, which are covered idiosyncratically here, you might try About the Author by Alfred and Emily Glossbrenner.<br /><br />The book concludes with a good index that lists all of the books and authors mentioned.<br /><br />This will not be your most valuable guide to other books, but it will be useful.	2004-09-23

In addition to Pendergast, characters from previous novels are also here, to good effect -- Vincent D'Agosta and Laura Hayward.<br /><br />The novel begins with the mysterious and apparently sinister death of a widely hated art critic, and continues in New York City and Florence, Italy.  A cast of creepy characters are well drawn and the mystery pays off well, with exciting action scenes and believable reasoning in general.  The book is not perfect -- I figured out the murder technique instantly and occasionally an otherwise intelligent character does something downright foolish -- but it is still entertaining enough to merit 5 stars, in my opinion, and I look forward to the next instalment in the series, clearly foreshadowed for us.	2004-09-22

Of course their lives parallel the books and part of the enjoyment is discovering the patterns.  Fowler is a good writer and the novel is enjoyable though ultimately disappointing.<br /><br />I was absolutely thrilled with the first chapter, thinking I'd found what would become one of my favorite books.  The story of Jocelyn, the first member to host a club meeting, was brilliant -- charming, lively, witty and touching; however, subsequent chapters were less charming, less interesting and, most disappointing, discussed the Austen novels less and less as they progressed.<br /><br />Still an enjoyable, if flawed, read.	2004-09-22

When Eden \\"supercouples\\" start committing suicide, Lash tries to figure out what went wrong,  The characters are good, the dialogue is fine, and there are some spectacular touches such as The Tank, where computer avatars of Eden's applicants search for their matches.<br /><br />HOWEVER, there are some problems -- mostly small but one big.  First, one victim gives a major clue to Lash, but it is never brought up again.  Secondly, Lash receives harassing phone calls, makes an assumption about who is calling him, and confronts that person -- why doesn't he just do *69?  Lash is increasingly harassed but just ignores it.  etc<br /><br />The book is 356 pages long and I figured out the mystery on page 170.  The ending is derivative and unoriginal.  I won't say more, but I kept reading, hoping that there would a twist.  There wasn't.<br /><br />In the acknowledgments the author thanks Douglas Preston for supplying a crucial chapter.  Too bad he didn't supply a more interesting ending as well.	2004-08-28

The emphasis is on building things yourself, and to that end it is an extremely valuable handbook for our increasingly passive society.  There are definitely things here that will give you pause or that are culturally dated -- like making a blow gun, trapping and raising wild animals and taxidermy at home -- but that is where parenting comes in, and all-in-all I would say this is a valuable and exciting book for kids, filled with pragmatic insights and a fun historical document as well.

A hardback large book contains five condensed stories (Lion King, 101 Dalmatians, Lady and the Tramp, Jungle Book and Bambi) and is attached to a special holder for a mini-movie projector and two mini-reels for each story.  In the book, colorful illustrations and large-print words are accompanied by margin pictures showing which of 16 projector images complements that portion of the text.  This is all done very well; however, the projector is so mini that it needs to be very close to the wall or screen in order to be seen (2-3 inches) and the image is very small.

What I especially enjoyed were the insights into the techniques and thinking of a White House reporter.  If you want a book that will keep you on th edge of your seat and challenge you, this is an inadequate read; however, if you want an interesting thriller that revolves around politics, you should enjoy this debut outing from McGrory.  I would read another book by this author.	2004-08-24

Introduced with facts about tools, techniques, photography hints and ethics, the book continues with chapters on each of three regions of the state -- White Mtns and Northern, Uplands, Southern plains and hills --  each beginning with a color map showing the 20-30 viewing sites listed, followed by color drawings of various species and a page for each site which lists a description of the locale, viewing information, directions to the site, ownership, size, closest town and recreation and facility information.  With lots of colorful photographs and practical information, this invaluable book concludes with a species index.  Terrific.	2004-08-24

A large hardback book contains five condensed stories (Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White) and is attached to a special holder for a mini-movie projector and two mini-reels for each story. In the book, colorful illustrations and large-print words are accompanied by margin pictures showing which of 16 projector images complements that portion of the text. This is all done very well; however, the projector is SO mini that it needs to be very close to the wall or screen in order to be seen (2-3 inches) and the image is very small. Also, the room needs to be very dark, which makes it difficult to read the story, even with the projector's second light turned on.  The best way to use this would be to have your child sit in a completely dark closet looking at the pictures while you sit outside reading it loudly :-)<br /><br />This was a great idea but does not work too well, unfortunately. Definitely do not pay full price!	2004-08-24

What begins as a murder mystery becomes instead a touching portrait of a family's hardships as observed by the person most uniquely unable to handle them.  Author Haddon's deft touch makes this work.  The book could easily have become sentimental tripe but it never does.  This is a lovely and thought-provoking book.  I'm very glad I read it, have recommended it to others, and will undoubtedly re-read it again some time.	2004-08-24

In my opinion the two chapters on fantasy and prophecy are less successful, but if you are considering this book then you should definitely read it.  It's filled with wonderful lines and terrific criticism (both positive and negative) of contemporary novels by Austen, Wells, Scott, Dostoevsky, Proust, James and others, and it was this latter aspect that I found most enjoyable.  There is also an index so you can find these references when you want to.  Forster discusses the sense of time and space in literature, round and flat characters, food, sex, love, POV, story vs. plot and causality.  I've been reading novels for several decades and have read a fair number of books about writing, and I still gained insight from this lively little book.	2004-08-24

I did enjoy the book but was distracted by how much the action deviated from what I actually knew about the artist's life.  I think I might have enjoyed it more if it had been pure fiction instead of purportin to be about Artemisia.<br /><br />That said, the novel itself is well written and enjoyable, delving into the psyche of the emotionally scarred artist as she explores artistic themes and tries to deal with the men in her life.<br /><br />Not a stunner but perhaps an entertaining introduction to a fascinating artist.	2004-08-11

I thought it was less successful and entertaining but I still liked it and will undoubtedly give the series another chance.<br /><br />I thought the secondary characters were less interesting in this sophomore outing and I missed the character of Ranger, an intriguing colleague from One for the Money, who is present briefly but not developed at all.  Stephanie is quite an interesting and fun protagonist, however, which makes up for some of the novel's weaknesses.<br /><br />Worth a read if you interested in the series, reviews seem to indicate that later novels in the series are better, and I look forward to them.	2004-08-11

The book is divided into six chapters, each devoted to a state: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont, and a map at the start of each chapter locates the cities covered.  Each chapter contains entries listed alphabetically by city, and each entry contains a description, address, phone number, location, hours and sometimes a b&w picture.

The book's pages look rather like a television when we see how the episode appears to viewers.

My only complaint is that the pages are so busy with information that it's impossible to sit and really read the whole book, but perhaps it's best to let a child's curiosity guide you through a number of readings rather than trying to get everything in at one sitting.  Concepts are expressed clearly and with humor.  Justly popular with young students.	2004-07-31

With no experience and a fear of guns, Ms. Plum has a few adventures and gets into several scrapes as she pursues an accused murderer, mingles with other bounty hunters, cops, boxers, hookers and goodfellas, struggles with hocking her appliances, keeping her car running and making her outlandish family happy. There's a lot here, and it mainly works just fine. The protagonist is intelligent, resourceful and funny, and the supporting characters are well fleshed out.<br /><br />This is not a mystery per se, and the one misfire was the non-encounter with her most deadly foe, but otherwise I found this novel enoyable -- a perfect light read.	2004-07-28

There is not much diversity of culture, race or age.  Still, I did enjoy the humor and the sharing, and thought the writing was very good.

There are over 350 pages of quotes here (in standard typeface) and I bet it would be easy to put together another volume.  Quotes range from a sentence to a page, and give the context of the utterance.  As one might expect, George W., Ann Coulter, Tom Delay, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Newt and Rummy figure largely, and the quotes are as outrageous as one fears.  They are hateful, hate-filled and despicable, and go a long way in explaining the coarsening of American political discourse.	2004-07-07

This little book from the geniuses at Cook's Illustrated has helped a lot.  It is slight, at 5 by 7 inches and 94 pages, but the recipes are very good.  We've tried several (beef &amp; broccoli, kung pao chicken, hot-and-sour soup) and the results were excellent.  And, typically for these chefs, the steps are not difficult though there are a lot of them.<br />You will find instructions, analysis and helpful illustrations for the following recipes (and variants): wonton, egg drop and hot-and-sour soups; pan-fried and steamed dumplings; steamed fish; kung pao chicken; beef &amp; broccoli in garlic sauce; sticky white and fried rice; pork lo mein and cold sesame noodles.<br />There is also an introductory chapter on equipment, ingredients and techniques.  Another winner from this great team of cooks.	2004-06-09

I enjoyed these essays written by mothers practicing attachment parenting (AP) techniques, but I thought it was way too earnest and quite humorless.<br />I think I would really have enjoyed this book more if I were pregnant or a brand new mom and unfamiliar with principles of AP, so if that's you, this is definitely worth a shot.  I thought I would enjoy it as a mother who had, like these women, had the joy of discovering that there was another, better, way to raise my children, but I found it to be too humorless and repetitive to be truly enjoyable.  Short, two to three page, articles detail the experience of a new mother, frazzled, trying to follow traditional ideas of parenting, finding a better way, and everyone being mostly happy afterward.	2004-06-04

The book begins with a fascinating chapter that covers the events of September 11th, 2001.  Tellingly, Rice leaves Clarke in charge of post-WTC bombing operations, and she goes to the bunker with Mr. and Mrs. Cheney while Clarke and his colleagues stay in the Situation Room, working even as they believe that they will likely be killed in a further attack.<br /><br />The next chapters discuss events in the Middle East, the rise of terrorism and the American response to terrorist acts during the administrations of Reagan, Bush the elder, Clinton and Baby Bush.<br /><br />The book documents the distinct responses to terror threats by the Clinton and Bush administrations: Clinton issued an Executive Order in 1995 designed to go after terrorist funding and another in 1998 specifically to go after bin Laden and al Qaeda, tripled the FBI counterterrorism budget, pushed for Saudi cooperation in terrorist investigations, gave major speeches about the threat of terrorism, secured additional funding for counterterrorism, intervened in Bosnia to undermine efforts by bin Laden to establish a foothold in that country, bombed al Qaeda facilities, issued orders to have bin Laden killed, created the Counterterrorism Security Group, reinforced American embassies worldwide, held dozens of Principals meetings, foiled a number of Millennium plots, and asked for a Pol-Mil plan for al Qaeda, which included planning, goals, resources, timelines and responsibilities, and was later given to Condoleeza Rice in January 2001 though it was adopted by the administration until AFTER September 11th.  By 1996, knowing that al Qaeda had a presence in over 50 countries, Clinton and his people &#34;were preoccupied with it&#34;.  Clarke states that &#34;[Clinton] had seen earlier than anyone that terrorism would be the major new threat facing America, and therefore had greatly increased funding for counterterrorism and initiated homeland protection programs.&#34;  In contrast, during a time of increasing alerts and chatter, George Bush went on vacation.  Clarke resigned his post in frustration, and his replacement quit after a few months because the administration was still not going after al Qaeda but was instead concentrating on Iraq and was &#34;using the War on Terror politically&#34;.  More importantly, they have not been effective in making us safer since 9-11, have weakened our military capabilities, underfunded first responders, reduced civil rights, and squandered the opportunity to unite the American people and build international alliances.  While firefighters dug through the rubble of WTC, Bush & Co. were already plotting to use the horrific event for their own political ends.<br />Prince Bandar, in the news recently due to Bob Woddward's book, makes some interesting appearances here, as do Louis Freeh, George Tenet and many others.  The FBI and the Pentagon come off especially badly here, but Clarke also gives a lot of credit to individuals who worked hard on this threat, including FBI agent John O'Neill, the counterterrorism expert who is the subject of Frontline's &#34;The Man Who Knew&#34;, an excellent documentary about an agent obsessed with al Qaeda and bin Laden, who quit the FBI in frustration, went to work as head of security in the WTC and was killed on 9-11.<br /><br />What critics do not give credit for is that Clarke was a government employee who had built a solid 30-year career and who operated behind-the-scenes.  He gave up his privacy and his livelihood, knowing full well that the Bush Slime Machine (aka Karl Rove) would try to destroy his character and his life, but he still came forward because he thought this information was so important.  Furthermore, his contentions have been corroborated by other insiders.  We all owe this man a debt of gratitude for his actions -- before, during and since 9-11.<br /><br />One thing I've not seen anyone mention is the incredible implication of the title.  After dedicating the book to the murder victims of 9-11, Clarke uses the preface to discuss the Constitution.  He states that the President, naturalized citizens, bureaucrats, and FBI and CIA agents all take an oath swearing to protect the Constitution &#34;against all enemies&#34;.  He says that this is our first mission, &#34;not unnecessary wars to test personal theories or expiate personal guilt or revenge.  We must also defend the Constitution against those who would use the terrorist threat to assault the liberties the Constitution enshrines . . . It is essential that we prevent further attacks and that we protect the Constitution . . . against all enemies.&#34;  Wow.  So Bush and Cheney and Ashcroft are some of those referred to in the title.  And I couldn't agree more.  What are we defending if we allow ideologues to change the essential nature of our way of life?  if something is wrong, I want someone to step up and point it out, and if I were ever in trouble, I would want Richard Clarke beside me.  He is a remarkably brave, competent and articulate individual, and a true hero.<br />Incredible tale with many interesting revelations.  Essential reading.  Highest recommendation.ng and since 9-11.

Proverbs are listed alphabetically, and each entry includes an explanation, an example from literature, origin, variants, cross references when appropriate, and a list of sayings with similar or opposite meanings.<br />For example, the entry \\"neither a borrower nor a lender be\\" reads:<br />It is advisable never to borrow or lend anything, specifically money: \\" 'Neither a borrower nor a lender be' is a lesson I learned too late, after losing $200 and the friend who borrowed it.\\"  The proverb comes from Shakespeare's play Hamlet (1:3; 1600-01) and is part of Polonius's advice to his son Laertes.<br />The book concludes with indexes by keyword and  by theme as well as a bibliography.  The print is clean and I was able to find all of the proverbs in which I was interested.  My only complaint is that the year of origin is given, but not the source.	2004-04-09

As fun as the film was, the book is even better.  I loved learning about the social history of the 1930s and 40s and an account of horseracing in that era.  The things jockeys did to stay underweight!  With four years of research backing her up, the writing is vivid -- filled with lively anecdotes and quotes.  Hillenbrand is a terrific author, and the races come alive as she writes.  This is a fast and fascinating read about a scruffy horse and the three men who joined with him to create an inspirational racing team.  It is well-written and exciting, contains pictures, notes, an index, Seabiscuit's official career racing chart, an interview with the author and discussion group questions.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-04-06

The story is well told, but it seems obvious that the author is a historian -- the story and characters in the past, with a few exceptions, seem much more interesting.<br />Still, this is a fun read, particularly if you're interested in Boston's history.	2004-03-18

Narrated by a new acquaintance of the diva-detective, we learn about Doyle's story from Irene Adler's point of view, which also gives us an interesting look at Victorian England -- both from a proto-feminist's perspective and from a more traditional spinster of the time.<br /><br />Much as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead turned Hamlet on its head, this interesting story brings Adler to the fore and relegates Holmes to an occasional visitor to the story. In the course of the narrative we also meet Oscar Wilde and Bram Stoker, as well as some familiar fictional characters.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that it will enhance your pleasure if you read A Scandal in Bohemia before reading this fun book. Douglas has done a great job of creating a convincing backstory to the original, and she writes very well.	2004-02-19

The language is friendly and the examples are entertaining as well as informative.  If I lived in Flint, I'd take his classes.<br /><br />There have been many times I've read a book and just *known* the author is trying to impart more than I am taking away from the prose, and I hear about symbolism in literature, yet I have very little success finding it on my own.  One time in high school I had a very good English teacher who would point out the symbolism in stories and novels, but he never told us how to do it, as this book does. With chapters on a wide range of topics (journeys, meals, poetry, Shakespeare, the Bible, mythology, fairy tales, weather, geography, violence, politics, sex and illness, among others) and a wide variety of examples, I found myself learning A LOT.  Certainly this would not be of much value to a literature graduate student or professor, but for the rest of us this is a great introduction to getting more out of our reading (or viewing, as the author also touches on film, though to a lesser extent).<br /><br />The book concludes with a test, in which you read a short story and interpret it using the principles put forth by Professor Foster, then interpretations by several students and Foster himself -- delightful and illuminating!  Finally, the author gives a suggested reading/viewing list and an index.<br /><br />Two problems with the book: first, as I mentioned, the style of the author is conversational, but sometimes to the point of being distracting; secondly, the topics covered are quite idiosyncratic, leaving out as many as are included, though the author addresses this. Still, I give the book 5 out of 5 because it was entertaining, accessible and it has improved my understanding and appreciation of subsequent books I've read and even films I've seen.<br /><br />Update (06/12/16): Critical reviews seem to concentrate on two negatives -- that the author overgeneralizes (&#34;Every meal is communion&#34;) and that the material is repetitive. Perhaps both elements can be explained by noting the intended audience -- college undergraduates. Critics want it known that &#34;sometimes a cigar is just a cigar&#34;. I agree wholeheartedly. It's been a while since I read this book (Can it really be over a decade?!) but I don't remember coming away thinking that symbolism was universal and nothing was ever meant literally. If the author actually made that statement I do disagree. Perhaps he qualified the universal within the text? Regardless, even if the author overstated his position in that instance I garnered so much benefit from the book that its ideas inform my reading to this day. No book is perfect, and I suppose the professor would enjoy that some readers do criticise his ideas!<br /><br />As to the second perceived flaw, repetitiveness, if you've ever taught you know that you can't say something once and assume it's been internalized. Personally I found repeating concepts often helped me, and often the same idea is related in a different context, so it's not presented identically, if I remember correctly.<br /><br />I do not know, but I suspect, that those readers who did not enjoy it were either too sophisticated for the material, or not ready for it. Personally, as someone with a background in the sciences and social sciences who reads a fair amount of fiction, and not someone who has heard these concepts discussed very much, I learned a lot from this book and believe it continues to add to my enjoyment and understanding of fiction in books and film.<br /><br />I would still give it 5 stars.

It's been difficult to be a liberal for the last, oh, couple of decades.  I used to think Ronald Reagan was bad, until George W. came along with his experienced team of grey-haired criminals.  Many is the time I've seethed as right-wing extremists like Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter (aka Nutcase) criticized liberals at the same time they've coarsened public discourse, impeached a president, denied citizens the vote and stolen an election.  Then we're told we should &quot;get over it&quot;.  That Tom Delay and Dick Cheney love this country more than we do.  Well, I'm not over it, and Delay and Cheney and Rove don't know what this country is about, and it is absolutely lovely to hear someone (a) point these things out, (b) refute the BS with research and facts, and (c) do so with a laugh.<br />With chapters on Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, the Wellstone memorial service, the military, abstinence, tax relief, pig feces and Barbara Bush, this is a terrific mix of comedy and savage ridicule.  This is less detailed than recent books criticizing the administration (eg Joe Conason's Big Lies) but also more accessible -- a great gift for your conservative relations before the upcoming election.<br />I hope this is the beginning of a moderate and liberal movement to take back our country, and I hope the next president will appoint Al Franken Secretary of Information (and Ralph Nader to clean up corporate crime and Al Gore Secretary of the Interior) -- hey, a liberal can dream!	2004-01-27

Set in 1908 Abilene, it is the story of orphan Art Atchinson Aimesworth, his friend Spaulding Littlefeets and his sister Esther.  One Christmas Eve Art receives a mysterious box and a summons to come to the North Pole -- signed &quot;S.C.&quot;  Intrigued (to say the least!), Art and his cohorts construct the machine inside the box and fly off to visit Santa, where adventures await them, Mr. and Mrs. Claus greet them, and Art renews his love for his sister.  There is a surprise ending that lets us know that Santa and Esther have been in cahoots all along.<br />This is a story that will appeal to children of all ages because there is mystery and adventure (and Santa!), and as they get older they will appreciate more of the story.  The illustrations are colorful and full of details, so they will stand up under multipe viewings and repeated scrutiny, and the vision of Toyland is uniquely Joyce and reminiscent of pre-modern children's illustrations.<br />A fun and heart-warming story.	2004-01-15

Ferdinand would rather sit under a tree and smell the flowers, and his mom thinks that's just fine. This is a comforting story for kids who feel they don't fit in. The message is simple and direct, and makes for great discussions after reading. The original illustrations are quite charming as well.	2004-01-15

All does not proceed smoothly however. Nor does it proceed in a linear fashion. This is a book that tells the tale of a husband and wife and their child, and their hunt for a house in a town of books. But it also meanders, perhaps not uncoincidentally, like a bibliohunter loosed in a rambling old bookstore.<br />The book is friendly, casual and conversational in tone. There are many charming stories and interesting facts related as the author turns his attention to matters literary and otherwise. I learned a bit and laughed a bit, and look forward to rereading it when I someday go to Hay.<br />The book is vaguely dissatisfying because the author himself still seems out of focus, but he uses metaphors nicely and has some delightful sound bytes as well; for example, &quot;The book trade does provide a certain shelter for those whose humors might ill-suit them for work elsewhere.&quot; (pg 140) That is just lovely, and as an American whose parents and brother are British, Collins can combine the two perspectives to good effect. He offers distinctions found among the newspapers of Britain, discusses the history, customs and people of the town, lays down a lovely riff on the unspoken code of book size and lettering, and relates amusing bibliohistory, such as columnist James Payn's 1893 advice: &quot;When one hears of a publisher being shot by an author, it is well to have all the facts before us before expressing disapprobation.&quot;<br />The author obviously has genuine affection and passion for writing, which makes this a fun read.	2004-01-11

And of course, after an afternoon's tutelage, the lovely woman is so awed by Jack's prowess that she discovers her own sexuality and pleasure. Later she and Jack convert her maid because she has been impudent, and still later a young widow. Up to this point, even if not exactly how you would want young men to behave in the real world, the story is harmless enough and titillating. At this point, though, the story takes a decidedly disturbing turn. A matron and her daughter have been rude and boorish, and to punish them the quartet rape the pair repeatedly and force them to have sex with each other numerous times. They are not converted to the joys of the flesh, but only traumatized by it. While not as brutal as de Sade, neither is this just a fun roll in the hay either. I think this last adventure ruins it.<br />In addition, the author seems not to have had any authentic sexual experience whatever -- does anybody really think that you can drive a woman to an insane frenzy with a *feather* for goodness sake?<br />If you are looking for fun erotica, stop reading at page 199, or try something a bit less dark.	2004-01-11

It does not promise to be a complete reference, nor does it purport to be a literature course of any kind. It offers to be a friendly and casual guide, and that is exactly what it is. There are 13 chapters, distinguished by topic: bad girl books, exploring our sexuality, hearing your inner voice, coming of age, mother issues, existential crises, taking care of business, midlife crisis, political, bad hair babe, martyr queen and embracing your inner light books. The approach is breezy and mildly informative, though one does wonder why it is &#34;our&#34; sexuality but &#34;your&#34; inner voice.<br /><br />Each chapter begins with a one or two page humorous essay followed by reading suggestions, each with a paragraph or two of description and comments, a couple of humorous discussion questions, and a miscellany of quotes, facts and reminiscences. The first chapter, for example, &#34;When You're Ready to Embrace Your Inner B!tch: Bad Girl Books&#34; features Moll Flanders (1722), The Scarlet Letter (1850), Gone With the Wind (1936), The Portable Dorothy Parker (1944), Auntie Mame (1955), Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1962) and Too Good for Her Own Good: Searching for Self and Intimacy in Important Relationships (1990). Also included are a list of bad girls to invite to a girls' night, Notes from Nancy's and Bev's Reading Journals, and quotes from a number of bad girls, including Cher and Carrie Nation.<br /><br />One's unsurprising complaint with a book like this: I want more. There are only 6 or 7 recommendations in each chapter. It's clear these authors are well read, so I would have liked more actual book and author recommendations, particularly ones I'd never heard of. The books that were recommended were interesting and appropriate choices I thought -- there was one I'd never heard of, a couple I'd never got round to reading, a couple I'd read many years ago, and a couple where I thought 'Oh yeah, I should read that'. I enjoyed reading about books I'd already read and appreciated being reminded of the ones where I'd let myself be satisfied with the film, but would have liked at least another five I'd never heard of. There is a lot of humorous filler, which works because the authors are good writers and funny, but the next edition needs more reviews. Also, putting the selections in chronological order would lend some historical context.<br /><br />Complemented by a good index, this is not a book to read straight through, but rather to be perused as the mood hits.<br /><br />As for previous critics' claim that the book falsely purports to be for young women -- that would have been &#34;Grrrl's Guide to Books&#34;, wouldn't it? The unnecessary meanness suggests some unresolved issues with mom. You know what? You'll like her again some day.

The concept is great and exciting for kids and adults, and the cut-outs are well done. I bought the book used and am glad I did so. While this is a fine book with heavy paper, cut-outs and spiral binding, and you can see why it's so expensive, it's still very expensive.

With one major flaw, it is a vindication of observers' assertion that a right wing conspiracy was hounding Bill Clinton, among others, and waylaying the democratic process. In this readable political history wrapped around a personal odyssey, we first learn about Brock's relationship with his father, his awareness of himself as a gay man, and his political involvement at university. Is Brock telling the truth? An article in the New York Review of Books stated that a number of people quoted or described in the book have said that the bits about them, at least, were accurate. Is Brock an opportunist who may take the often-repudiated, often-reclaimed low road ala Geraldo Rivera? Maybe. Whether or not he does will not detract from the wealth of information he imparts. Brock was right in the thick of the Clinton-hating, Anita Hill-bashing movement -- working at the American Spectator, operating for Richard Mellon Scaife, rubbing elbows with the blonde bimbos.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed getting the dirt on the right-wingers who stepped all over the Constitution in two coup attempts -- the unsuccessful impeachment of a duly elected president and the successful Florida 2000 debacle that ended with the Supreme Court's silver-platter delivery of the presidency to a well-funded princeling who'd actually lost the election. These same people are running things now. They are in the White House. They are getting big paybacks that will cost this country dearly. And yes, I want to know about them.<br /><br />Choice bits: Ann Coulter questioning whether &#34;to impeach or assassinate&#34; President Clinton; Laura Ingraham saying she doesn't really believe the things she says on television; Matt Drudge, right-wing arbiter of morality, taking the author out on a date (not that there's anything wrong with that); William &#34;I'm-more-virtuous-than-you&#34; Bennett saying that hate-filled Rush Limbaugh is &#34;possibly our greatest living American&#34;?! It's as if every bully who ever took your lunch money or beat up your kid brother or stopped a recount by sending thugs down to Miami is now in politics. Brock tries, somewhat successfully, to explain why he stuck with ideologically void strategists and publicists fronting for religious fundamentalists and worked for billionaire conspiracy-monger Richard Mellon Scaife; he is less successful at explaining why they hate Clinton so much (though he is burdened by trying to explain the irrational), but he does a fine job of documenting the phenomenon. He describes the desperate mentality that justifies all actions in the name of conservatism, whether or not it tramples the Constitution and whether or not it any longer bears a resemblance to true conservatism. Scaife, who still believes that Vince Foster was murdered, funds many conservative organizations including the Federalist Society, dedicated to bringing radical jurists to the bench. Brock addresses the consequences of a radically conservative judiciary, and it is frightening.<br /><br />Where the author excels is in describing the evolution of the far right political movement in the past two decades -- the Reagan coalition, the birth of the neoconservative movement, and the Gingrich Revolution with its shift from political battles to moral. He also captures the hypocrisy of the men and women who decry adultery and homosexuality in the morning then seduce their own interns or meet at D.C.'s gay bars in the evening; the conservative think tanks and organizations that get tax-exempt status; partisan organizations that decided to impeach Clinton long before anyone had heard of Monica Lewinsky .... &#34;trampling&#34;, as the author states, &#34; the Constitution for partisan ends, to gain power they couldn't win in an election&#34;. Amen.<br /><br />The book is also a condemnation of the mainstream media, who not only gave Brock's very biased book about Anita Hill great reviews, but who regularly confer legitimacy to even the most blatantly partisan shills. (I'm sure Matt Drudge's appearance on Meet the Press and Rush Limbaugh on This Week with David Brinkley had Edward R. Murrow spinning in his grave.) Brock states that, after years of working at the American Spectator and writing books under conservative editors, he later learned that journalists usually had fact checkers! Brock admits that his writing was filled with fabrications and sourceless rumors, and that he made no attempt to verify or balance the misinformation. Early in his career he believed what he was writing, but later he did not. You may or may not want to put your coins in the pocket of the author, but this is a very interesting and readable expose.<br /><br />Democracy's only hope, if we can't depend on the loyal opposition to grow spines, is that the right is so mean, nasty and vicious that they will turn on each other. After reading this book, I fully expect that to happen.<br /><br />This book is filled with a wealth of information about the links between individuals and organizations, particularly Scaife, who seems to be democracy's Moriarty -- a sinister mastermind at the hub of all that is wicked in rightist politics. The only problem with the book is that there is no index. With so many names and organizations listed, it's a real fault not to have one, but I had so much fun that I'm giving it 5 stars anyway.r legitimacy to even the most blatantly partisan shills.

There are many characters here, none of them pleasant -- the protagonist's mother is one of the most annoyingly weak characters I've ever encountered on a page -- and many with similar names.  One key character has a complete and irrational reversal of motive and action at the end of the book, and the ending is lame, particularly considering that the reader has invested the time and energy to slog through over 800 pages of text.<br />Unless you are a glutton for punishment, do yourself a favor and reread Dickens or Conan Doyle instead.

Structured into four sections labelled Lolita, Gatsby, James and Austen, the author discusses her life and the lives of others in Iran while drawing parallels and distinctions to these authors/books and their characters.<br /><br />The author was a literature professor at a major Iranian university though she eventually quit rather than wear the required veil.  Much of the book discusses her conversations with students while at university, including the &#34;trial&#34; of The Great Gatsby, which many students found deplorable for its glorification of adultery, cheating and murder.  After leaving the university, Nafisi began meeting at her home with a small group of female students.  She describes them unveiling when they entered and again donning the clothes of oppression before leaving, and the conversations in between.  Several of these women spent time in jail, not because of the book group, but for various infractions that we would find laughable if it didn't mean that these young women were incarcerated for years and abused in jail because of them. Everyone at these meetings knows people who have been killed or jailed by the regime, including early supporters, who lost control of the rebellion against the Shah and watched as the imams took over and became increasingly oppressive. The atmosphere seems very similar to the Russian Revolution except instead of being hijacked by a secular Stalin, the populist movement was hijacked by the fundamentalist Khomeini, and the author several times addresses her shift from activism to irrelevance. The point is also repeatedly made by the women that it is men's obsession with sexuality that imprisons them, though women pay the price, and that even men who disagree with the radicals often go along without defending their mothers and sisters, sometimes even taking additional wives. People not only struggle with living under a regime based on punishment and fear, but then are uncertain about whether or not to leave -- to stay and try to make a difference or to get out while they can.<br /><br />In addition to these heavy issues, we are treated to the author's observations about life in a very different culture, and we get her very insightful comments on several Western authors.<br /><br />If you are interested in politics, the Middle East, women's issues, literature or biography, you should read this fascinating memoir.der a regime based on punishment and fear, but then are uncertain about whether or not to leave -- to stay and try to make a difference or to get out while they can.

When they put on some of the clothes, fairies transport them to a magical land where the fairy Queen has lost her powers and the Lion has been imprisoned by an evil wizard.  So far so good.  I guess everything else would be acceptable to me if the solutions weren't so arbitrary and senseless.  Mark and Flora give the Fairy and the Lion their dress-up clothes and all the problems are gone and the evil wizard, who we never see -- what's HIS side of the story? -- is suddenly rendered powerless.  Yet, the dress-up clothes have been accessible to the fairies and animals the whole time.  And why is the Lion bound with snakes?<br />A strange book -- pretty but devoid of charm or substance.	2003-12-23

This leads to uncomfortable and even dangerous situations as the adventurous young girl meets hungry ogres and nasty stepsisters! But good things happen to Ella, too. She loves her mother, has a trusted elder who watches after her, she has a talent for languages, and she has befriended the prince.<br /><br />My one problem is that the first part of the story is heavily populated with elves, fairies, giants and even a pet centaur, but these elements are unceremoniously dropped, not to be mentioned again.  In all other respects, however, this is a wonderful update of the classic fairy tale, with elements from that story adapted with ingenuity and humor. Well done!	2003-12-22

Things couldnt be better, right? Think again! The Jedi are kidnapped and taken to Phindar, a planet ruled by a criminal who has people's memories erased. Things only get worse when one of the Jedis falls into his clutches and is slated for a memory wipe!<br /><br />This is an exciting story and explores further the developing relationship between Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon. Auxiliary characters are fun, especially the jovial Derida brothers, and Yoda is present in spirit if not body. There are a few battles but violence is not graphic.	2003-12-13

There is a lot of affection for his mother and family, and this part is interesting primarily because King, as you would expect, weaves the story well and brings relevance to his anecdotes.<br /><br />The second section, about 150 pages, is composed of Toolbox and On Writing. These cover the very basics of writing (vocabulary, grammar and the overused adverb) and the craft of writing, respectively. On Writing is the section I enjoyed the most. Here, King gives practical advice on writing goals, the first vs. second draft, narration and description, dialogue, plot vs. story, theme, pacing, back story, symbolism and revision. He also discusses more esoteric points such as the redemptive power of writing. Using examples and naming authors, King imbues this portion with invaluable  instruction and recommendations.<br /><br />About 20 pages are devoted to the author's being hit by a van as he walked along a Maine country road, and this will be of interest to those who want to know more about this episode in King's life.  This incident and King's recuperation occurred while he was writing this book.<br /><br />The book concludes with a 5-page first draft of a story's opening scene followed by an edited version of the same passage, and a list of books King had read recently that he found exemplary in some regard. Both of these sections are useful for someone who is interested in writing or wants to pursue King's ideas further.<br /><br />I think this book was interesting, entertaining and instructive, and I would highly recommend it to aspiring authors (whether or not the horror genre is your cup of tea) or those who are interested in King the man. This is a great chance to get practical advice from a very successful author.ance to get practical advice from a very successful author.	2003-12-12

The book is a page-turner from start to finish, and along the way you learn a lot and want to stay up late reading.  What's not to love?  My only complaint is that otherwise intelligent characters are often extremely uninformed about matters of common knowledge -- this is an awkward way of allowing the author to explain things to the readers -- but otherwise I found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable thriller.  Violence is not dwelled upon, though people are killed in bizarre circumstances, and the material may be offensive to some Catholics but not most.  The book would benefit from a page or two telling the reader what is fictional and what is not.<br />Lots of fun.	2003-11-22

Not only has the level of discourse degenerated, but it seems as if those responsible are consistently rewarded for their lying and bullying and, not satisfied with that, they've used every dirty trick to undermine our democracy -- impeaching the president, stealing the 2000 election, gerrymandering Texas, recalling the California governor, rigging voting machines (you KNOW it's going to happen) ....  There doesn't seem to be any limit to which conservatives won't sink in their quest for power and money, and as a moderate liberal I wonder how we can defeat liars and bullies without resorting to the same tactics? Thank goodness, Joe Conason and others (Molly Ivins, Michael Moore, Al Franken) are finding their voices, and speaking truth to power.<br /><br />In the introduction, the author makes the case that almost all good things enjoyed in this society (overtime pay, safe working conditions, minimum wage, unemployment insurance, consumer protection, public education, clean food and air, Social Security and universal suffrage, among others) have been brought about by liberals against strong conservative opposition. Conason states that the demonization of liberals has been a conscious strategy by right-wing strategists like Lee Atwater and Karl Rove, enabled by an infrastructure of foundations and think tanks financed by wealthy paranoics like Richard Mellon Scaife.<br /><br />Organized into ten chapters, each addresses a lie told loudly and repeatedly by right-wing extremists:<br /><br />(1) liberals are elitists while conservatives care about the common people -- this is a joke when one considers how the pseudopopulist Right cravenly caters to corporate interests at the expense of employees and consumers<br /><br />(2) liberals control the media -- the media is increasingly controlled by corporate owners and while reporters may be liberal, the editors and publishers are overwhelmingly conservative<br /><br />(3) conservatives are more patriotic than liberals -- it's appalling to hear chickenhawks (aka draft dodgers) like Bush, Cheney, DeLay, Gingrich, Limbaugh, Lott, Rove, etc. criticize the patriotism of Democrats, who actually outpace conservatives as veterans.  Also, with Republicans in control of everything, soldiers are still on food stamps and being asked to pay for their costs in Iraq! The Right uses the American flag like a prop; as Johnson said, &#34;Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel&#34;. Furthermore, some conservatives still revere the treasonous attempted secession of the South and conservative organizations like America First served as cover for German and Japanese agents during WWII. Most recently, William Safire and George Nethercutt have both said that freeing Iraq is worth one or two body bags a day -- sound patriotic?<br /><br />(4) conservatives are better economists -- by any economic indicator -- GDP, inflation, job creation, deficit reduction -- Democratic presidents have done better than GOP leaders. The savings and loan debacle occurred under Reagan, who ran up a $3 trillion national debt, and W has squandered the surplus given to him by Clinton. Since the Gingrich Revolution, pork has risen exponentially, with GOP districts currently receiving about $612 million more than Democratic districts.  oink<br /><br />(5) liberals are concerned with political correctness but not individual liberty -- unless you count freedom from surveillance and theocratic rule, freedom of information, etc.<br /><br />(6) conservatives support family values -- there's enough sanctimonious hypocrisy to go around here, yet at least liberals tend to be tolerant of others, while conservatives deride others even when they share the same problems<br /><br />(7) liberals exploit minorities -- there's a reason minorities don't vote for the GOP, and you need look no further than the horrid &#34;jokes&#34; told by Reagan, Bush and others, aswell as the policies informed by those attitudes<br /><br />(8) conservatives are champions of free enterprise -- unless you consider crony capitalism and corporate welfare free enterprise.  Even Alan Greenspan, a revered economic conservative, recently stated that he was wrong about market regulation.  PS -- Why did the Bush administration repeal sanctions against offshore US companies?<br /><br />(9) Bush is a compassionate conservative -- only if by &#34;compassionate&#34; you mean willing to end Head Start and after-school programs, gut environmental laws, tax families while ending dividend and estate taxes, and reduce public health spending.<br /><br />(10) conservatives are tougher on terrorism -- where is Saddam?  Where is Osama?  Why was Bush hiding in Air Force One on 9/11 rather than leading his country?  Why is the administration obstructing all efforts to examine the events and conditions that led to 9/11? Why did Ashcroft reduce spending on terrorism measures when he got into the Justice Department? How could Reagan trade arms for hostages in Iran, bungle Lebanon and lift sanctions from Pinochet's Chile?  Why did Poppy Bush train Osama bin Laden and give Saddam Hussein anthrax, botulinum and nerve gas?  Why did Dubya violate closed air space on 9/11 to hasten bin Laden family members and Saudis out of the country before they could be questioned by the FBI? How could his administration ignore warnings by outgoing Clinton officials that al-Qaeda was a major threat?<br />Conason uses facts, and quotes to refute the agitprop. He repeatedly and convincingly targets Anne Coulter and Rush Limbaugh. Also, this is the most complete account I've seen of George W. Bush's execrable tour of duty in the Texas National Guard.  (Indeed, none of Barbara's four sons served in the Vietnam conflict, which suggests that the Bush twins won't be headed over to Iraq anytime soon either.)<br /><br />Conason delivers a lot of information and it's well organized, so this would be an awesome little item to tuck under your arm as you head off to join your family for the holidays -- there's bound to be a relative or two who swallow all the manure spread about by BushCo.<br /><br />To paraphrase Francis Bacon, it is the inquiry, knowledge and belief of truth that is the sovereign good of human nature.  Cravenness abounds in conservatism at the moment.  It's up to the American people, assisted by thoughtful research like this, to find the truth.

Personally, I have no problems with conservatives.  Some of them are very nice people.  heck, I'm even related to a few!  In this country, we are founded on principles of tolerance and compromise.  Our founders had many differences of opinion, but they stuck it out and found solutions to their disagreements.  That is my problem with Coulter and Limbaugh and Savage.  They don't listen.  They don't debate.  They construct their own boogey-liberals and then proceed to rip them apart, without ever engaging in a real discussion.  Civility is an essential civic virtue, and it's people like Anne Coulter who degrade public discourse until all we do is yell at each other and nobody listens.

Books	4	23	33	N	Y	research + humor = a winning liberal formula	I can't tell you how heartening it is to see the liberals, and in particular the FUNNY liberals (didn't know there were any, did you?), coming forth and revealing the lies and manipulations of the crony capitalists occupying our government.<br /><br />In less than three years this administration has taken a budget surplus and turned it into a record deficit.  They took the good will of the world after 9/11 and quashed it with arrogance. After running around hiding on Air Force One most of 9/11, Bush took time out from protecting Bin Ladens and Saudis to tell the American people to SHOP. While police officers and firefighters were risking their lives at Ground Zero, Bush and his cronies were already planning to use the tragedy as an excuse to bomb Iraq. This is the group that was going to bring dignity back to the White House?  I guess lying in the State of the Union speech doesn't count. The economy is in the tank. Bush's contribution to foreign policy is a policy of pre-emptive strikes. (Can you say &#34;unintended consequences&#34;?) Our civil liberties are being snatched away. Environmental protections are being gutted.  Worthy social programs are being dissolved. And the answer to every problem -- tax cuts for the wealthy.  Gee, how's that worked so far? Except for Halliburton executives, are any of you better off than you were three years ago?<br /><br />Yes, it heartens me to see liberals speaking up and getting organized, because the world I envision is much different. We live in a wonderful, wealthy and influential country. Wouldn't it be nice if we exported hope and help rather than fear and bombs? Wouldn't it be great if we had the best public education system in the world?  Wouldn't it be awesome if our soldiers weren't dying for oil?<br /><br />Moore's book is one of many topping the bestseller lists, and I hope they're sweating in the White House, because even the easygoing American public is fed up with the twisted, greedy sludge pouring out of Washington these days. The clown prince should start making plans for his unemployment -- and I hope he goes into seclusion because I don't ever want to see that ignorant smirk again.<br /><br />Moore and others (Al Franken, Jim Hightower, Molly Ivins, Joe Conason) have tapped into a rich vein of electoral discontent, one that Ashcroft and Cheney (aka Bush's puppetmasters) would be wise to listen to, but you know they won't because they are arrogant sociopaths. Moore questions Bush family links to the Saudis and the Bin Laden family as well as the untruths ladled out by Bush, Cheney, Rice and others.  He uses many sources (even Fox News!) and offers direct quotes. He gives ideas on taking back our country and talking to your pseudo-Republican relatives.<br /><br />If you are a liberal, this book will make you happy. Moore brings up a lot of good points and he is funny. If you're a conservative, you will see the writing on the wall -- people are fed up with these extremists. Either way, buy the book. Moore is using his big Bush tax return to help unseat the pretenders.<br /><br />Run, Oprah, run!ce should start making plans for his unemployment -- and I hope he goes into seclusion because I don't ever want to see that ignorant smirk again.

A map shows the location of each of the 50 hikes, which are divided up between the Franconia Notch, Waterville Valley/Squam Lake, Kancamagus, Crawford Notch, Pinkham Notch, North Conway, Evans Notch and North Country regions.  An easy-to-read chart lists all the hikes and their difficulty level, distance and whether or not there is a river, a waterfall, a lake or pond, a view, rock ledges, wooden bridge, blueberry bushes or special geological feature on that particular hike.  A short introduction to each region details facilities available such as camping sites and visitor centers.  Several pages are devoted to each hike, including length, elevation gain, time requirement and difficulty level, a description of the trail, highlights for kids, directions to get there, a map and a photograph.  The book concludes with a bibliography and index.<br />If you get one book to help you explore the White Mountains, it should be this one, particuarly if you are hiking with children.	2003-10-10

For their own reasons, they each decide there can be no romance between them, but in the meantime they are still attracted to each other and Daniel helps Phoebe develop self-confidence. The characters are likable enough, and Phoebe does become more empowered throughout the course of the story, but there wasn't anything particularly interesting about  the story or the characters, so I won't be reading any more in this series about the Barone family.<br /><br />Also, this book got several things wrong about Boston -- the main library doesn't have a parking lot, for instance, and there are definitely no ranch houses in Boston proper! This would be more forgivable if the book weren't part of a series of over a dozen books about this family -- surely the author must know the city better than is evidenced here?<br /><br />Altogether, as interesting for the title as anything else, and perhaps a harmless read for a high schooler.<br /><br />Pretty bad cover too.	2003-09-29

He goes on to explain and predict liberal and conservative thinking, sometimes even contradictory thinking, on the death penalty, corporate welfare, conservation, abortion, gun control, fiscal responsibility, minority rights and other contemporary issues.<br /><br />Lakoff writes clearly and makes coherent points. I thought this was an interesting and predictive way of discussing current political differences. A self-declared liberal who nevertheless maintains a reasonably objective authorial stance, Lakoff advises liberals to couch their political arguments in the same moral terms that conservatives have been using successfully for years. Liberals are neither immoral nor amoral, as often depicted by Tom Delay, Newt Gingrich and other extremist conservative; they need to make that known and enter the political discussion on those terms.<br /><br />The author goes on to analyse the social utility of the two approaches to family and cites research showing that, contrary to conservative prediction, children who are raised with physical punishment in a highly authoritarian home often grow up with little external motivation or control, and consider violence an acceptable alternative to negotiation.<br /><br />This is a thought-provoking book for those interested in the application of cognitive science to social thought, or rationalists interested in politics.nterested in the application of cognitive science to social thought, or rationalists interested in politics.	2003-09-23

I'd read about it in the New York Review of Books and, encouraged by the author's having won literary awards (oh! if I only knew then what I know now!), was distressed to find it almost unreadable, replete with sentences like this:<br />'Though stimulated by her patronage - Gardner was one of the first to see Loeffler not only as a virtuoso but as the composer he wished to be and increasingly today is regarded as - Loeffler grew to feel at one point distinctly imposed upon by Gardner, who seemed to him possessive and only too willing to \\"show him off\\" in Ralph Locke's words, as \\"a kind of in-house virtuoso\\" in the Gardner music room, all of this, or (sic) course, quite classic behavior on the part of humble but artful, trustworthy but vain, kind but cruel and rampagingly dominant Isabella!'<br /><br />Yikes, I thought, somebody messed up. Perhaps the editor forgot to edit and the reviewer forgot to read? Several weeks later I heard an interview with the author on NPR and listened intently, waiting for someone to ask the author about this horrid, florid style, and was shocked that neither correspondent nor callers ever mentioned it! Since that episode I've saved the reviews for books I intend to read so I can compare my reading experience with that of critical reviewers, and I have been shocked (shocked!) at the disrelation -- not just once but many times.<br /><br />Enter B.R. Myers, who takes on the literary establishment with this delightful, accessible and pithy critique, starting with a preface about the work's beginning as an Atlantic Monthly article, continuing with chapters devoted to critical darlings Annie Proulx, Don DeLillo, David Guterson, Paul Auster and Cormac McCarthy, and ending with an epilogue on the response of critics to his reproaches, a humorous set of rules for the Serious Writer, copious endnotes and a bibliography.<br /><br />Myers states his premise early on -- \\"some of the most acclaimed contemporary prose is the product of mediocre writers availing themselves of trendy stylistic gimmicks\\" -- then goes on to cite passages used as examples of brilliance by critics, analyzing their many flaws by calling attention to unimaginative content, repetitive phrasing, tedious structure and glacial pacing; he contrasts these excerpts with selections by Woolf, Nabokov and Balzac, among others. Perhaps even more scathing are his strikes against literary critics (contrasted several times with the \\"common folk\\" at Amazon.com) who not only praise style over substance, but who lavish praise without explanation, dismiss as philistine anyone who doesn't agree with them, and look down their noses at genre fiction -- the current refuge of story and character in American literature. Most telling is the epilogue, where Myers shows how prickly critics use straw-man arguments and ad hominem attacks to dismiss his position.<br /><br />I've always been an eclectic reader, finding satisfaction and insight in the classics, genre fiction and nonfiction. But I throw my hands up in despair at the tripe that passes for literature with a capital 'L' these days and, when so many readers have access to almost any book imaginable, I'm angry at the editors, publishers and critics who have enabled this descent into unreadable exercises in style.  Talk about codependent relationships! I'll take James Michener and Jane Austen over David Mamet or Don DeLillo any day of the week, any week of the year. Myers uses clear writing (imagine!) and lots of examples to show that, indeed, you are not crazy! The garbage critics have been telling you is genius is really just .... garbage.<br /><br />I think there are fine contemporary writers out there -- Richard Russo, Jane Smiley, Christopher Buckley come quickly to mind, as well as superb writers in (horrors!) genre fiction, authors who recognize that style services, rather than obviates, plot and character. But somewhere in the 20th century the arts got hijacked by an elitist group that thinks anything that can be understood by the hoi polloi must not qualify as art; that any painting or novel that is popular must be dismissed; that style triumphs over substance; and that obscurity and novelty pass for style.  I don't know how to defeat hateful, boorish snobbery, but I think that the great unwashed masses sharing opinions  in forums like Amazon.com is a great way to begin.<br /><br />Bless you, Mr. Myers, for taking on this naked emperor.

When Lily approaches several adults and asks them to do things for her, she finds they are busy and she's forced to do things for herself.  Lily is learning self-reliance, but her mischievous charm is absent.  It's nice to see these characters again, but this is the least captivating outing by this pair.	2003-09-11

King is a superb writer and she captures the eeriness of the English moor, but I was a bit disappointed with this novel, and give it a lower rating than the first three books in the series.<br />This is a good book -- with interesting characters and circumstances -- but the pacing is very sloooooow, the mystery is not terribly interesting and, most egregious of all, the dialogue between Russell and Holmes, usually the high point of this great series, never sparkles.  Perhaps others are disappointed at the lack of detail concerning the couple's romantic life; I am more interested in their intellectual communion, and that is sorely missing here.  I also noticed a fair number of typographical errors for the first time in the series, suggesting lazy or hurried writing, or perhaps a lack of editorial assistance.  Perhaps Ms. King should take a rest between novels?  It's a shame that this book does not live up to expectations, being a continuation (of sorts) of Holmes' greatest adventure.  The mood of the moor and Baskerville Hall are great, the many characters are well written, but unfortunately the spark is not here.  Still a fun read for fans, but not as good as the three previous efforts.  I will continue to follow the series, but will probably buy them used.	2003-09-11

If you are a fan of Pendergast, then the big payoff here is that there is a lot more of him; no other recurring characters (like reporter Smithback) are here, except for a short cameo by a minor character from Cabinet of Curiosities.  Just eccentric, wealthy, mysterious Pendergast.<br />Personally, I liked seeing more of this fascinating Holmesian detective, though it's still not clear who he is, what his family history has been or how/why he continues to work for the FBI.  I thought the setting of a small Kansas town surrounded on all sides by 7-foot tall corn was unusual and very creepy, and the authors continue to create interesting and complex characters.  I thought the ending chase was too long, however, the solution too easy, and the murders overly gross.	2003-09-03

England is recovering from the First World War, and the Second is not yet on the horizon.  Russell and husband Holmes are busy with their various pursuits in the quiet Sussex countryside when an old friend's afternoon visit and subsequent murder get them embroiled in a mystery with lots of red herrings.  Mary and Sherlock, assisted by Inspector LetradeJr., Mycroft and Billy of the Baker Street Irregulars, go undercover to investigate suspects.  Again, as in earlier instalments, interactions and dialogues between Russell and Holmes are the high points of the book, so their working separately unfortunately limits their time together.<br /><br />King writes about Holmes in love so delightfully and so plausibly.  It's wonderful to think of him having this charming and affectionate relationship with a strong and intelligent woman.  Who'd have thought Holmes would become the romantic hero of the 21st century?  King has also created a terrific heroine in Mary Russell, with wit and intelligence shining through her turbulent adolescence, her blossoming young adulthood, and now her early marriage and academic career.  I look forward to further books in the series, and hope there will be children!<br /><br />If you demand an intriguing and difficult mystery, you will probably not be satisfied, but if you are a Holmes fan with a heart, you should enjoy this third book in the Mary Russell series.	2003-08-30

Her relationship with Holmes is necessarily changing, and a renewed friendship has involved her in a women's organization with a charismatic and mysterious leader.  Mary is intrigued.  So are we.  Author King writes with a sure and steady hand, weaving interesting historical detail effortlessly into a fine tale.  More importantly, she writes Sherlock Holmes exceedingly fine.  Conversations between the two are the highlights of the book, which suffers only from too little Holmes.  Mary Russell is an admirable heroine, and I look forward to reading her further adventures, but she truly sparkles in dialogue with her mentor.<br />Not just for romantic Holmes-loving bluestockings!  Great series.	2003-08-30

I really enjoyed the first two novels in the Christ Clone trilogy about the rise of Christopher Goodman, cloned from cells found on the Shroud of Turin, as told by his friend and mentor Decker Hawthorne.  What an awesome premise!  Beauseigneur is a good writer and Decker is a fine narrative protagonist.  The books were exciting and interesting, and by the end of the second novel I was really anxious to read the ending.  What happened?<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING:  Where there had been imagination, suddenly there is just a spouting of Revelations.  I swear, there is a 53-page section that is just one character telling Decker stuff straight out of a Bible-thumper's visit to your front porch, and just as welcome.  Suddenly, all the intelligence that we had seen from this author is replaced by Christian dogma.  I had really hoped that this talented author would find a way, literarily at least, of reconciling the Good/Evil  Christian/Everybody Else dilemma, or of saying &#34;both views have problems and this is the reality&#34;, but instead we get straight dogma shoved down our throats.<br /><br />If you are a Christian who wants to read a narrative version of Revelations, this is for you.  Anyone else, read the first two (very good) books and make up your own ending.  You could not do any worse than Beauseigneur has done here.<br /><br />Very VERY disappointing.	2003-08-25

Holmes has retired to Sussex to keep bees and one day he meets Mary Russell, a lonely and unhappy teenager, wandering the hills.  He is immediately surprised by her intellect and the two strike up an unusual but satisfying friendship.  Eventually, and inevitably, they solve some mysteries together.<br /><br />Ms. King is a fine writer, and the story and characters (including Watson, Mycroft, Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade) are quite fun, with Mary acting as the narrator.

In this first instalment, Obi-Wan is feeling desperate because he has one month to be chosen as a Knight's Padawan or else his Jedi training must stop.  He clings to the hope that Qui-Gon will take him on, but Jinn has painful memories of an earlier apprentice, Xanatos, that keep him from wanting to take on another.  Still, as Yoda explains to his friend, sometimes fate decides things for us, and he turns out to be right as Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan find themselves travelling together on a ship fraught with danger.<br />Since we know how this will all turn out eventually, what becomes important is the journey, and this first in the series is an enjoyable introduction to three great characters -- Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon and Yoda.  The situations are interesting and the other characters are realistic, but the heart of the story lies in the excitement of seeing Jinn and Kenobi taking their first tentative steps toward a partnership.  Great fun!	2003-08-15

This one-volume illustrated adaptation of the novel works very well indeed. What I'm probably most grateful for is that, while not a verbatim transcript, it is a fairly complete adapatation -- even Beorn is here! As for artwork, I always measure Tolkien art by the depiction of the hobbits, and Gandalf, and Wenzel does a fine job IMO. (His pictures are quite different from the cover art.) The hobbits aren't the best I've ever seen, but they're not freakish either, and the dwarves and Gandalf and the elves and the settings are all quite nice.<br /><br />This would be of interest to a Tolkien collector, a fun read for graphic novel fans, and a nice introduction to the Tolkien canon for wee folk.<br /><br />Note: I believe there is also a three-volume graphic novel though I haven't seen it.

He's not there long when an emergency situation makes him reassess the desirability of engineering the human genome, but by then things seem to have gotten rather out of hand.

After a brief introduction on technique, over 120 species are described.  Each entry is two pages -- one a b&w line drawing of the leaves/needles, and the other a text description that includes the common and scientific name as well as information about the specimen's range, habitat, profile, branching, shoots, leaves, buds, twigs, bole, bark and fruit.  Species are organized by taxonomic family and include:yew, pine, willow, walnut, hazel, beech, elm, rose, sumac, holly, maple, dogwood, heath, honeysuckle and others.  The book concludes with helpful identification shortcuts, a reading list and a good index.<br /><br />This is not a perfect book:  the introduction is helpful but not terribly informative, there are no maps, there are no color photographs (how about a color insert of transitional leaves?), and the coloring on the cover and spine make it almost impossible to read the title of the book; however, this is otherwise a solid and extremely helpful field guide that will add to your enjoyment of the New England forest, whether it's in the backwoods or your backyard.	2003-08-08

All 302 are covered here, as well as 179 occasional species.  This compact yet comprehensive  book begins with 28 pages of introduction, including instructions on using the book, identifying birds and field technique.<br /><br />Profiles are one page per species, and the quantity and quality of the information on each page is spectacular.  Each entry contains the family and species name; the length,wingspan and weight of a typical specimen; plumage, habitat and migration information; and descriptive paragraphs about the species' song, behavior, breeding, nesting, population and conservation as well as a distribution map (with migratory information); and pictorial depictions of the species' flight pattern and nest identification.  Also included is a scaled silhouette and at least one color photograph.  (More pictures are included if the male/female/adolescents/seasonal plumage differ in appearance.)  There are blank spaces to note the date, time and location of a sighting.  After these 302 entries, smaller entries describe each of 179 bird species that are considered vagrant or casual visitors to the region, and contain the name, a color picture, a distribution map and the average length of that specimen.  Entries are organized taxonomically, beginning with birds that do NOT perch and sing, and continuing with those that DO.  The book concludes with a glossary (though nowhere does it define 'altricial' -- meaning born helpless, a word used frequently in the entries), a good index, and acknowledgments, including picture credits.<br /><br />I'm an old reference librarian, and I have a shelf full of flawed naturalist guides, so I'm not easily impressed -- but this guide is spectacular.  If you have any interest in the birds of New England, this should be the first guide you get.	2003-08-07

The author's descriptions are horrifying and riveting, and developments have led to a situation both complex and thrilling.  Will Christopher Goodman, the man cloned from cells harvested from the Shroud of Turin, be elected Secretary General of the UN?  Is he a returning messiah, or could he be the Anti-Christ?  You HAVE to read the first book of the trilogy, In His Image, before tackling this one.<br />This seems to be an intelligent, educated and creative series, and I'm really looking forward to reading the last book to see how it all turns out.	2003-08-05

Right away, I heard about Kingdom Come as a great graphic novel, so of course I picked it up -- and was definitely blown away.  The basic story revolves around the retirement of the older generation of superheroes and the rise of a new generation that doesn't have the same moral compass.  Superman has retired to a farm after he becomes disillusioned with humans' supporting the flashier but less ethical metahumans, and now Wonder Woman has come to ask him to get involved again and help tame the ne'er-do-wells.  At the same time, Batman and Superman renew an old animosity, and many many superheroes make appearances, especially in the climactic battle between the good guys and the bad.  The story is very good, but it's Alex Ross's artwork that is the star here.  His rendering of the older superheroes is brilliant (Superman looks awesome), and the color is bright and bold.  (Personally, I don't like comics that are so dark that you can barely see what's going on -- I like the mood but I want to see the details too.)  The font is clean and the panel configurations are creative.  I liked the introduction by Elliot Maggin, who was writing the novelization of Kingdom Come at the time, and I especially enjoyed the follow-up material: sketches of major characters; id's of 105 (!) superheroes depicted in the novel; 2 pages about the development of a sequence, with facsimiles of the script, a photo reference, rough thumbnail sketches, pencil artwork and the finished art; and original artwork created for a t-shirt, comic covers, collection cards, books and posters.  Alex Ross even identified a number of his friends and relatives who inspired various character depictions.<br /><br />This is a gorgeous graphic novel with a very interesting premise and fun extras.  I think this would appeal to young and old comic book fans, or anyone wanting to see a classic in the graphic novel format.  Sweet.	2003-08-03

The story of the three children who overhear their parents talking about the house needing painting and decide to surprise them will have you and your children turning the pages with bated breath as you wait to see what that house looks like!  It's worth the wait -- a laugh-and-a-half for kids and their adults.  As you'd expect, the illustrations are colorful and fun.

Finally, Blue Kangaroo must take matters into his own paws if he wants to avoid being lost permanently.<br /><br />Lily, not a perfect child in the traditional sense, has much that is loveable about her, and the affection between her and Blue Kangaroo is very sweet.

If you think he's busy, you'll be blown away by all the events of this book -- they come fast and furious.  Decker's old mentor asks him to be a witness to his having found living cells on the Shroud of Turin, but it's not until years later that he realizes his friend and colleague has cloned the cells and is raising the child, named Christopher Goodman.  Decker's relationship with the boy as he grows and realizes his destiny is the subject of this first book.<br />A minor complaint I have is that the time jumps are erratic -- several chapters are a few weeks apart and then there's a jump of seven years, then a few weeks, then years later, etc.  Otherwise, the plot is mind-blowing, the writing is very good and the characters are interesting.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this interesting and exciting speculative thriller, and am anxious to read the second novel of the trilogy.	2003-07-29

The pictures and colors are brighter than usual and I liked that, and though the drawings show less detail than is typical, I liked the artwork too.  The weakness here is the story.  Mace Windu makes several errors of judgment (and is even reprimanded by Yoda for not consulting the Council); also, there is a LOT of fighting, which I consider the last resort of the Jedi, not the first, yet no attempt is ever made to deal with the Yinchorri other than fighting with them.  It makes you wonder how the Jedi are any different than anyone else.  The character of Master Giiett is interesting and we do get more information about members of the Jedi Council, which is always welcome.	2003-07-20

RELIC was a fine thriller, set in the NY Museum of Natural History, a dark labyrinth of curious objects.  This time the pivotal scenes take place below New York City, in the dark labyrinths of subway tunnels, sewer drains and abandoned egresses, while the characters are the same.  This is a true sequel, so do yourself a big favor and read RELIC first. You'll find the same main characters: anthropologist Margo Green, FBI Special Agent Pendergast, police lieutenant D'Agosta and reporter Bill Smithback, and it's nice to see them because they're all interesting and intelligent characters.  A new character is introduced, Sargeant Hayward, who is also intelligent and cynical about her idiotic and sexist superiors. She gravitates toward our group, in a sort of Ayn Rand meets Stephen King way.<br /><br />This time out someone or something has been killing homeless people, and our protagonists must learn about and enter the frightening depths below The City. The plot intensifies as they realize that one of the victims is someone they knew during the events of the first book.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the book took a while to get going, for me at least, and really only took off after page 100, when Pendergast showed up. From there it is a superb thriller, and I stayed up to finish it until 4 am, turning pages quickly, interested in all the story threads as they played out and converged.<br /><br />Masterful, intelligent and thrilling, this is a great read -- but read RELIC first!!	2003-07-06

But is the killer even human?<br />This is a fun and fast-paced thriller.  The NY Natural History Museum is an inspired setting, with loads of creepy objects stored in labyrinthine splendor.  Also, the characters are very interesting, and not formulaic (FBI=brilliant, police=bad/stupid) as many thrillers are.  The scientists shine as they help solve the mystery, and the suspense is maintained throughout this 470 page book.	2003-06-30

At the center of it all is Harry Potter, whose parents, along with many other decent witches and wizards, were killed by the evil Lord Voldemort, stopped only when he tried to cast a lethal spell on baby Harry but was thwarted at the same time Harry gained his tell-tale scar.  Harry's friends are Ron Weasley, member of a large and respectable (if poor) wizarding family, and  Hermione Granger, the bright and hard-working daughter of Muggles (non-wizards).<br /><br />At the end of Book 4, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Lord Voldemort had succeeded in reviving himself and gathering some of his dastardly followers, though he again failed to kill Harry.  In this book some wizards, led by Hogwarts' beloved headmaster Albus Dumbledore, have joined the Order of the Phoenix, an organization whose mission is to thwart Lord V's evil plans; however, many wizards, including Cornelius Fudge, head of the Ministry of Magic, refuse to believe that Voldemort is back, and Fudge has placed a sympathetic crony, Dolores Umbridge, at Hogwarts as the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. It becomes increasingly clear that she has no love for Dumbledore or his students, and seems to want to make everyone miserable, especially Harry.<br />Harry, Ron and Hermione are having a very tough year.  They're not allowed to help the members of the Order of the Phoenix because they're too young, Umbridge is making everyone miserable, Hagrid is nowhere to be found, Wizarding Level Exams are approaching, Harry is having girl troubles, his scar is painful especially after the odd nightmares he's been having, and he has to take private lessons from his least-favorite teacher.  What else can go wrong?  Plenty!<br /><br />This is a terrific, fun read with fine writing, clever names and inventions, and an exciting plot that furthers the saga of Harry's time at Hogwarts. Just shy of 900 pages, fans will be delighted to have a lot to read (and re-read) as they wait for further developments.<br /><br />Caveat:  Harry's story is based on the premise of his having witnessed the murder of his parents and violence, while not glorified or too explicit, is here.

Both stories are character rich and intricately plotted.  Separated by two centuries but connected by similar circumstances and goals, Mireille de Remy and Catherine Velis each finds her way to Algeria as she attempts to gather the pieces of the legendary chess set of Charlemagne and command the action of  a real-life Game being played by opposing sides who will stop at nothing, including murder, to win.<br />This is a satisfying thriller with the added dimension of a historical mystery.  You will learn a lot about the Freemasons, the number eight, Algeria and chess, and you will also get embellished introductions to many historical figures of the time, including Catherine the Great, Robespierre, Talleyrand, Napoleon, Benedict Arnold, Marat and Jacques-Louis David.<br />I thought the heroines were both admirable, which is tricky in this genre.  You want them to be intelligent but somehow sympathetic while they remain clueless for the longest time.

The first relates a difficult period for Obi-Wan, when his actions resulted in the death of another apprentice while the second takes moves forward to a time when Anakin Skywalker has become Obi-Wan's Padawan and Qui-Gon has been dead several years.  While Obi-Wan tries to be a good mentor to Anakin, he learns that the past is not easy to leave behind.  Anakin is an exceptional student in many ways, but perhaps Yoda's concerns that he was too old to learn the Jedi ways were correct.  As Obi-Wan and Anakin investigate the captain and passengers of a spaceship community, they continue to develop their relationship together at the same time each is troubled by his own problems.<br /><br />Characters are interesting and well-written and the plot is engaging.

It is 1193 and Richard is being held for ransom.  While Eleanor tries to raise the money and keep John from a treasonous grab for the throne, Justin gives her invaluable assistance and also solves a murder closer to home.<br />Penman brings the 12th century to life with details about the everyday existence of people as they go about their business.  Her style is wonderful, flowing easily and beautifully, and she writes well for different characters -- the conversations with Prince John and Justin's enemy/ally Durand fairly sizzle with malice and innuendo.<br />A notable undercurrent in this novel is the relationship between parents and children, and we see the consequences of familial dysfunction in the case of Justin and his estranged father, the two murder suspects and their bullying patriarch, and Prince John and his politically astute mother.<br />This is a terrific novel and I can't wait to read more of this series -- Justin de Quincy is a fun protagonist and Eleanor and John and Durand are compelling historical figures who jump right off the page.

I was certainly not disappointed by this extraordinary tale with its fantastical characters and settings.<br /><br />In this story, the mysterious Mr. M has commissioned Wilhelmina Harker Murray (from Bram Stoker's Dracula) to gather a league of adventurers who will perform extraordinary tasks when the need arises.  The first part of the story is devoted to the formidable Miss Murray's finding and assembling her group: Allan Quatermain, H. Rider Haggard's hero; Captain Nemo from Jules Verne's tale; Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll (and his counterpart Mr. Edward Hyde); and Hawley Griffin, from H.G. Wells' The Invisible Man. Along the way they are assisted by Auguste Dupin, literature's first detective, and threatened by Fu Manchu. There are lots of other literary references and these are fun, but you can easily enjoy this fine graphic novel without catching them.<br /><br />Throughout the book, in editorial notes, author blurbs, etc, the conceit is maintained that this tale was written and published in the 19th century.  Also included is a heavily-illustrated prose tale, 'Allan and the Sundered Veil'.<br /><br />Caveat: If you are a parent buying for children, you might want to find something else -- there is a lot of graphic violence and coercive [explicits].	2003-05-13

Preston and Child work well together, and I'm interested in reading their solo work as well.<br /><br />In this not-quite-contemporary setting (only one person has a cell phone, for instance), New Orleans FBI Special Agent Pendergast is inexplicably interested in the recent discovery of a charnel beneath a New York construction site.  He builds a team of assistants: Nora Kelly, Utahan archaeologist determined to make a go of her once-in-a-lifetime chance at working at the world's greatest natural history museum; William Smithback, reporter aching for a Pulitzer (and a suit worthy of the acceptance ceremony); Patrick O'Shaughnessy, a sergeant in the NY Police Department, fifth generation cop at the mercy of a cruel and petty precinct captain; Proctor, his invisible and indispensable chauffeur.<br /><br />These main characters, excepting Proctor, are well fleshed out and engaging, while Pendergast himself is an intriguing variant on the Sherlock Holmes-style detective. (These characters appear in other books by the same authors.)  A healthy field of minor characters are also three-dimensional. Settings are vivid and evocative. Dialogue flows naturally. And bonus -- I even learned a little about urban archaeology and the scientific/fantastical collections of the title.<br /><br />Very well done. I'm anxious to read more from these authors and to read more about these characters. If you are interested in an intelligent thriller rooted in NYC history, you will probably enjoy this too. If you like Caleb Carr, Iain Pears or Jack Finney, you will likely appreciate this masterful and gripping mystery.	2003-05-13

He is a good friend and son, but struggles with the issues that get to kids everywhere -- shyness, patience, etc.<br />This activity book contains 30 stickers that can be used (and reused) on the book's end pages, which depict a beach and a beach picnic scene.  Activities include sorting, a maze, word search, spot the difference, connect the dots, picture search, word scramble, coloring and a secret code.  There's even a recipe for juice pops.  The book finishes with an answer page.<br />This will be a help to you when you are travelling with little Franklin or puzzle book fans.	2003-05-01

The book comes with a centerfold that pulls out to become a poster, game pieces and a board that become a matching game, and seven two-page spread coloring pages that depict party scenes.  The coloring scenes are all on top of each other, so the book must be completely disassembled.  There are only a few words of text, and no story.<br />This book isn't that great but I'd give it an average rating for Dora fans who like to color, except that the paper quality is poor too.	2003-05-01

There are 30,000 kinds of beetle in North America.  They are plentiful and varied -- a real joy to observe or collect. This Peterson field guide begins with two chapters on collecting and preserving beetles, and then delves into their identification.  An anatomical flow chart on the endpages directs you to the various beetle families, and there you will find a physical description, similar families, and information about numbers, range, habits, collecting methods and examples. There are about 600 line drawings and 65 color plates.<br /><br />This is a solid field guide, but the meager percentage of color pictures is problematic. Beetles are quite colorful and that should be the most salient identifying characteristic, but neither the black & white drawings nor the often color-free descriptions help in that regard -- a real weakness for a guide to these beautiful insects. I would rather pay more for an all-color guide.	2003-04-29

In a sea of thrillers I grabbed this one because the premise was interesting.  It's the first novel I've read by Tim Green.<br />I'd say the author has good ideas and he tries to add depth to his characters, but his writing style is not very good.  I admit I like Jane Austen, so my demands are high, but his prose is often bland and occasionally clunky.  For example: &quot;With a razor, he slashed them open one by one to reveal an ensemble of underwater equipment, all of which was midnight blue and smelling of fresh paint.  He had known exactly what he needed and ordered everything over the Internet in a matter of a few hours.  Even though he could have any number of people who worked for him around the house unpack the gear, Kurt had given every one of them including Clara the day off.&quot;  Clunk.<br />I'm notoriously bad at figuring out mysteries and thrillers, but I got this one right away.  There weren't many surprises, though there were good ideas.  My impression is that this would be a great second draft, but it is not a novel yet.  Maybe Green needs a different editor.<br />It's the first novel I've read by Tim Green.  I don't feel a great urge to read another, though other reviewers suggest his other books are better, and I might pick up one based on the author's interest in his characters and his ideas, but I'd rank this effort as only average.	2003-04-26

Disney is becoming the ultimate cradle-to-the-grave company, and that big-picture, we-even-brought-the-toenail-clippers efficiency is captured in this compleat guide to all things Disney in the Orlando FL area.<br /><br />The book begins at the beginning: Getting Ready to Go gives sound advice on when to go, how to get there, various ticket options and even sample schedules for each of the parks (Magic Kingdom, Epcot, MGM Studios, Animal Kingdom) complete with must-see lists and tips for travelling with young children and maximizing the number of rides you get on.  There are lots of color graphics, charts and tip boxes to liven things up and present material understandably. A planning timeline is oddly reminiscent of a wedding planner, with things to do 6 months before the trip, 4 months, 3 months, 1 month, 2 weeks and 1 week before. Yikes!  Obviously Mickey is a better planner than me, who is grabbing a book the day before I travel and hoping to read it on the plane.<br /><br />The chapter on Transportation & Accommodations (including Disney cruises) is equally thorough, and then there is a chapter for each of the parks that includes maps, attraction descriptions (and sometimes pictures), shopping and entertainment information, and a Hot Tips section which did help us out.  After reading the book we hit the ground running and made good use of our time.<br />A hodge-podge chapter gives info about Downtown Disney, BoardWalk, Daredevil Disney, the water parks, spas, cruises and behind-the-scenes tours, and a Sports chapter covers golf, tennis, boating, fishing and swimming opportunities while you're in the area.<br /><br />Finally, the chapter on restaurants reminds you that even eating within the kingdom requires planning, but all the information you'll need is here.  We picked out a few restaurants we thought we'd like, and then when we got hungry we chose based on crowds and our location.  I feel we made an informed decision and were happy with our food, the experience and the way our time flowed.  Again, graphics and charts lay out a lot of information in a clear way.<br /><br />When every detail of services and attractions is in the book, the problem becomes one of finding those details relevant to you, and this index is comprehensive but it is not exhaustive.  If you want to squeeze every drop of fun from your holiday in Orlando, you will have to page through, marking and noting pertinent information.<br /><br />The ten coupons, all expiry dates in December 2003, were not helpful to us, featuring food and admission breaks at Disney Quest, Vero Beach and Hilton Head Island resorts, Dive Quest, Pleasure Island and the sports complex, Fantasia Gardens, mini-golf and Dolphins in Depth, but maybe they will be handy for you.<br /><br />This is a very helpful guide, well written and informative, though it could use a better index.<br /><br />Whether you are a plan-weeks-in-advance traveller or a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants traveller, a novice or a seasoned Disney visitor, this official handbook will help you get the most from your trip.ed on crowds and our location.

Told in the third-person, the narrative describes the actions and feelings of a queen, a criminal and a slew of London archetypal characters, but primarily our perspective is that of Justin de Quincy, the well-educated but illegitimate son of a cleric who is trying to find his place in the world.  A dramatic chance encounter leaves him with an introduction to Eleanor of Aquitane, who subsequently engages De Quincy as her agent in solving a local mystery that may have international implications.<br />The plot is interesting, the dialogue is authentic without being heavy-handed, and the characters are realistic in their histories and actions.  Penman knows her period, which shines through many details.<br />This is the first book I've read by Sharon Penman but it won't be the last.	2003-04-25

Along the way, you learn about the origins of dim sum, the significance of particular mah-jongg tiles, how to make an authentic Singapore Sling, and the correct way to greet a star.<br />Madeline's personal life is realistic without detracting from the story, and the story is interesting right away and paced well.  The mystery is well-integrated but not transparent.  The dialogue is fun, and the characters are likeable.  This is a lively mix of Hollywood dish, mouth-watering recipes and the Perils of Pauline.  Quite fun.  Well-written.  Looking forward to the next one.	2003-04-25

The book concludes with a listing and synopsis of books and films set in the area or about the area, and a very good index.<br /><br />Having just returned from a stay in Charleston, I can say that the chapter on that area was well-written, informative and presented well.  Museum and attraction listings include hours, fees and phone numbers.  Accommodations described were traditional, B&Bs, rental homes and campgrounds.  Restaurants are divided by cuisine and location; we tried four of them and were happy with the advice.  Entertainment information is given for festivals, concert venues, clubs and bars, playhouses, movie theaters and coffee shops.  Sports, recreation and shopping information proved reliable, and the transportation section addressed walking, tours, public transport and visitor centers.  Several pages discuss places of interest in the Greater Charleston area.<br /><br />This book was very helpful to us.  Well done.	2003-04-25

We don't always buy guides on vacations, but there is a lot to do in he Orlando area, and this guide was very helpful to us.<br /><br />information is included about accommodations, restaurants and entertainment, with names highlighted for easy location, plenty of handy maps, ratings and useful travel advice, though we were underwhelmed by the incomplete restaurant information for the Disney parks.  Fodor's always does a nice job of giving information for travellers with children, disabilities or special needs, and they are good about giving contact information, hours of operation and pricing.  Also, their suggested itineraries (based on the amount of time you have) are helpful.<br /><br />Chapters are about Walt Disney World properties, Universal properties, other properties (SeaWorld, Busch Gardens and Cypress Gardens), non-theme park attractions in the greater Orlando area, dining, lodging, shopping, recreation, night life, and Florida's Space Coast.  he book concludes with a good index.<br /><br />This book wasn't perfect.  If you're going to be spending a lot of time at Disney properties, for example, you should also get a guide specific to them.  And Fodor's is less useful for the budget traveller than other guides.  With those caveats in mind, this guide is useful and well organized.	2003-04-25

No nutritional information is given.<br />I've tried six recipes so far and have many more earmarked. Of the six I've made, five were quite successful and one was fine but unexciting.  The burnt-butter brown-sugar cupcakes are fabulous; the brownies are perfect examples of the dense, gooey style; the gingerbread with lemon icing and the cranberry upside-down cake were both delicious; and the white bread was a very good big rustic loaf.  The author generously acknowledges her sources in the text and in the bibliography and acknowledgements sections.<br />So far I've thoroughly enjoyed this personality cookbook, really like the recipes I've tried so far, and look forward to trying many more.	2003-04-13

It can be difficult to separate the cooking from the cult of personality, so to critique the recipes is to critique the woman.  The cookbook has lots of chatter and lots of white space, but Nigella Lawson is a charming woman, so the chatter is friendly and companionable, and the book has lots of white space but it is slender and elegant and filled with beautiful photographs of every dish.  Sections are organized as Breakfast, Comfort Food, TV Dinners, Rainy Day, Trashy, etc.  These are more colorful than helpful, but one can find recipes by name or ingredient in the well-constructed index.  No nutritional information is given for the recipes, but that's just as well.<br />I've tried eight recipes so far (and have many more marked to try).  Of those eight, I would say three were resounding successes: the icing for the chocolate fudge cake will be at the top of my list whenever I need an airy but flavorful frosting; the sweet corn pudding was very good; and the double potato and halloumi bake was delicious though I couldn't find the sheep's milk cheese required for two of the book's recipes, even at a gourmet cheese shop.  Two recipes were servable if not very exciting.  And three of the eight recipes did not work for me at all.  My Mozzarella in Carrozza, for example, never resulted in a stretchy warm concoction that I could pull lustily from my teeth, my neck outstretched in voluptuous splendor, though I tried several times.<br />Three additional comments: Several of the recipes I tried benefited from the addition of spice.  Secondly, recipes have been lazily retooled from the metric units originally used, so instructions often call for multiple multi-measurement ingredients -- 1 cup + 2 T flour, 1/4 cup + 1 t sugar, etc etc.  Finally, quite a few recipes call for self-rising flour; you can make the equivalent of 1 cup of self-rising flour by mixing 1 cup of all-purpose flour + 1-1/2 teaspoons of baking powder  + 1/4 teaspoon of salt.<br />Ultimately this is not a flawless effort, but Nigella has the charm and talent to pull off a successful personality cookbook, and though results might be mixed, the good recipes are archetypal.

Ordered by the essayists' date of birth, you will find the thoughts of Montaigne, Hazlitt, RW Emerson, HD Thoreau, Ruskin, Higginson, RL Stevenson, Proust, Hesse, H Miller, E Bowen, Nabokov, C Fadiman, Greene, R Davies, Calvino, J Fowles, H Brodkey, S Elkin, J Epstein, LS Schwartz and S Birkerts.<br /><br />I've read a number of such anthologies and, unfortunately, thought this was one of the weaker entries.  While it is inherently interesting to read the thoughts of such interesting writers, what they actually have to say is not always very enlightening or entertaining -- and it really should be one or the other, if not both.  A few of the essays were wonderful.  I really enjoyed those by Nabokov on good readers and writers, Calvino on reading the classics, Brodkey on the dangers of reading and Epstein on reading versus experience.  I thought Schwartz and Birkerts were the best writers, and Graham Greene's &#34;The Lost Childhood&#34; offset with a response from Robertson Davies was quite interesting.<br /><br />The book concludes with notes about the authors, a bibliography and acknowledgments.  I would have appreciated more editorial comment as well as information about the original date of the material rather than the date of translation, and better proofreading.  There were a distracting number of typos.<br /><br />All in all, there are a number of enjoyable essays here, but the quality is uneven and a lack of editing detracted from my enjoyment of this collection.  There are better books of essays about reading, though if you are especially interested in the topic, this volume would be a worthwhile addition to your collection.	2003-04-07

The Goliath Corporation eradicates Thursday's husband and pressures her to rescue Schitt while she is dodging murder attempts by an unknown enemy, helping her father try to save the world and taking bookjumping lessons from Great Expectations' Miss Havisham. Oh, and battling the occasional Supreme Evil Being to bring in a few extra bucks. Who says a woman can't have it all?<br /><br />The author writes dialogue superbly, and introduces new concepts and slang fluidly. There is lots of wordplay, and more than a few puns, but not so much as to be annoying. We see more of Thursday's father here, which is enjoyable, but her husband Landen is not really fleshed out. We are introduced to some terrific new characters, including Granny Next, condemned to live until she can read the ten most boring books ever written, and Miss Havisham, who loves anything with a gnarly engine. The brief cameo by Uncle Mycroft and Aunt Polly, though, is much much too little. Strangely, Thursday's partner Bowden is used to good effect in the first half of the book and then rather unceremoniously dumped, as are the rather fascinating neanderthals. Fforde adds some unique and wonderfully creative concepts this time around, many concerned with the world of literary characters who inhabit a magnificent library containing all the books that ever have been or ever will be written, on 52 (maybe 53!) floors of shelves stretching 200 miles in every direction.The librarian?  The Cat formerly known as Cheshire. Jurisfiction, bookjumping and footnoterphones roll off the tongue and into your consciousness effortlessly as Thursday Next proves once again that she is a superb agent -- intelligent, resourceful, diligent and good -- an admirable heroine and a worthy narrator.<br /><br />Anyway, you should read this book for the lively deconstruction of The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies, if nothing else! In keeping with the spirit of things, there is an associated puzzle and contest, and an active web site with BBSs in which the author participates.<br /><br />Really, it's impossible to convey all the creativity, fun and insight found here, but let me say that while I am a confirmed paperback and used book buyer, I got this as soon as the hardcover was available, and I will do the same with the next instalment, The Well of Lost Plots, due out in the Spring of 2004.

In some ways this book reads like ancient history. (Remember Archie and Gopher?  ftp?)  That said, you can still learn how to use many older and traditional information resources, and the book's main focus -- becoming a professional information broker -- remains relevant and intact.<br /><br />Part One, The Information Business, defines the market for information and the role and requirements of a professional information broker. Part Two, Fundamental Tools and Techniques, is a user-friendly guide to library, government and public records resources. These two sections are still quite useful, though obviouisly incomplete. Part Three, Electronic Options and Alternatives, is outdated, addressing no World Wide Web resources at all, though it does cover online special interest groups (SIGs) and bulletin boards (BBSs) well. Part Four, The Business Side of Information Brokering, is quite valuable and deals with completing a project, marketing, sales, pricing, contracts and billing.<br /><br />Appendices cover essential resources (books, software and magazines), vendors, conferences, associations and seminars. An accompanying 3-1/2-inch floppy disk contains the appendices as well as electronic forms and letters, and a sample report.  Stylistically, this disc is like a fine black & white movie.  ASCII text files ensure accessibility by multiple platforms, and elegant but casual writing combined with beautifully-formatted text is information rich.  If you buy this book used, make sure you get the disk too.<br /><br />In short, while some of the content is quite outdated, this book and disk would still prove invaluable for someone who is interested in becoming an information professional.

Snow and F.R. Leavis, Lillian Hellman and Mary Mccarthy, Truman Capote and Gore Vidal, and Tom Wolfe and John Updike.<br /><br />Arthur is an excellent writer, and it is great fun to read his elegant prose about badly behaved literary types.  I was familiar with some of the authors discussed but not all, as I was familiar with some of the animosities but not all of them.  Arthur turns a beautiful phrase and has a knack for finding illustrative, sometimes toxic quotes.  One good thing about fights between scribes -- they leave lots of luscious things in writing!<br /><br />The eight disputes are interesting by virtue of the characters or the topic or both, and the author does a fine job of describing the people involved and laying out the foundation and history of each quarrel.  Moreover, he makes insightful comments about the disagreement or the relative merits of the protagonists.  I thoroughly enjoyed these tales of intelligent people behaving poorly.	2003-03-31

I was anxious to read this book because I've always enjoyed 18th and 19th century literature, and believed that the humor found in the works of Austen and Burney were overlooked and undermentioned.  Author Bilger examines the works of Frances Burney, Maria Edgeworth and Jane Austen, and posits that the humor they used was subversive -- laughter at the expense of the overbearing patriarchal culture in which they lived.<br /><br />While this isn't exactly what I'd hoped it would be, it was more accessible than many scholarly works, and after I got into the rhythm and jargon of the academic writing, I found myself entertained as well as informed -- such a lovely combination.<br /><br />Laughter is a commodity too often ignored and a tool too often overlooked, but the author makes her case that these three authors consciously used satire, burlesque and parody to criticize their culture while maintaining the guise of docile co-conspirators.  Bilger begins with interesting chapters on women & comedy and Mary Shelley's feminism before discussing the lives of her subjects, their beliefs and their use of comedic technique and characters to undermine the dominant paradigm, as it were.  Naive observers, female tricksters, competitive women, nimcompoop suitors and ignorant patriarchs are described and then illustrated with short excerpts from the many works by these talented authors -- in particular Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and Northanger Abbey; Burney's Camilla and The Wanderer; and Edgeworth's Belinda and Helen.<br />I thought the most interesting chapter was on &#34;goblin humor&#34;, dark humor that is still considered distasteful by many and seems shocking when found in these quiet comedies of manners.  Here the author displayed a mastery of comic theory as well as the literature, and made her case admirably, without descent into the jargon-laden victimization theory that dominates feminist film theory, for example.  Rather, Bilger posits that Austen, Burney and Edgeworth found an outlet for what they could have considered a hopeless situation, and that they consciously and actively did their best to undermine the system in which they lived, reflecting and building upon the work of earlier feminists, and sending out beacons of camaraderie to women living under cultural and personal subjugation.<br /><br />The book concludes with a fine Notes section, a bibliography and a good index.what they could have considered a hopeless situation, and that they consciously and actively did their best to undermine the system in which they lived, reflecting and building upon the work of earlier feminists, and sending out beacons of camaraderie to women living under cultural and personal subjugation.

The authors made many important points about the male experience that were new to me, or vague, and also gave practical ideas and examples for achieving goals or avoiding conceptual traps.<br /><br />Kindlon and Thompson begin with the story of Cain, which is immediately disorienting. In a good way. I've always been puzzled about why God was so mad at Cain. I believe the fruit Cain offered was beautiful, so why was it of lesser value? I never thought God was fair to Cain, though admittedly Cain did react badly. So immediately you're in the state of mind to question perceptions about males as well as male perception (and reaction).<br /><br />I didn't find any intellectual oneupsmanship over which gender's got it worse. Instead I saw:  Boys are different, and here's what some of the differences are and why that's so, and how you can deal with that. I feel much better prepared for the many talks I hope I'll have with my children over the years. Important talks that I want to be transformative rather than reactionary or alienating.<br />This isn't just a book for the parents of adolescent boys, either. The authors make the point many times that giving boys an emotional education is imperative -- teaching them to recognize various emotions as physical cues and with emotional consequences. More importantly, the authors then cite cases from their clinical backgrounds and make down-to-earth suggestions about what to do to catch these problems and help our children. Young boys will benefit from your early introduction of these principles, including: giving a boy an emotional education and letting him have an inner life; recognizing that boys have a higher activity level (amen!) -- and accepting it; communicating with boys in a direct and respectful way, and enlisting them as problem solvers; using discipline that is instructive and fair rather than harsh and crushing; teaching a boy that there are many ways to be a man.<br /><br />This is a plausible theory informed by clinical experience, but most of all it is a catalog of simple actions that may make a huge difference in our sons' lives. Andrew Vachss' book, Another Chance to Get It Right, says these things so eloquently. Every day the collective experience of the world is the sum of the choices each of us makes individually. We decide whether to be lazy parents and raise mediocre adults, or do we try to make a golden age, populated by mature, happy adults who have the knowledge and the will to make the world a better place in their turn? Every day you decide whether to spank or to reason, to pressure or to embrace, to train or to teach, to saddle them with our baggage or let them be. Let Vachss' book motivate you and this book instruct you. You and your children will be the better for it.<br /><br />Well-written, insightful, transformative.g discipline that is instructive and fair rather than harsh and crushing; teaching a boy that there are many ways to be a man.

I liked her early statement that having a son had moved her from a rigidly feminist position toward one that is more flexible and humanistic. The first section discusses the traits that are uniquely male, and contains chapters on male energy, male role models, male separation and love & sex. I thought this was particularly informative. The second section deals with various special relationships -- shared parenting, single mothers, stepmothers and gay sons. Final chapters deal with the mature relationship between mothers and sons.<br />The author writes from experience and with compassion, and this is a worthwhile book for mothers (and sons) to read.	2003-03-22

Given that, however, this doesn't really make a very good sticker book.  Maybe if the letters on the pages were just outlines and kids stuck the stickers over the outlines it would be a little more fun, or maybe if there were another scene after the storybook where you could place the stickers it would be fun, but as it is all you do is plaster the sticker over an identical picture of the letter within the action of the story -- not really interesting or challenging, and a bit expensive for the privilege.  Just my opinion, but you'd be better off buying a nice big edition of this fun book rather than getting this sticker edition.	2003-03-21

After a chapter on the various types of vinegars, there is a chapter on vinegar and health, including old wives' tales as well as scientific research.

Each spread features, on the left page, one or two quotations or poems about the soul, our relationship to nature, etc. These inspirational thoughts come from philosophers, poets, novelists and many others, and the name, nationality and dates of birth and death are given. The right page contains a small picture with the location identified.<br /><br />This book is very similar to The Soul of the World by the same collaborators and published in 1993.  This volume is a little bigger, being about 7 inches square.  Though the setup is the same, the quotes are different and the pictures here tend to feature people rather than natural settings.<br />This book is lovely for yourself or as a gift to someone who is troubled or in need of solace or inspiration.

Written and drawn by mother and son team Betty and Michael Paraskevas, this trio is quite charming. The friendship between Beast and Hamilton is sometimes on shaky ground, but Maggie unites them all with her affectionate diplomacy and problem solving skills.<br />In this story, the Beast is embarrassed to tell his friends his secret .... he is afraid of something.  Maggie and Hamilton run down a list of things that scare them -- ghosts, goblins, aliens, sea monsters, etc. -- and each time they must admit that they have never actually seen one of these creatures.  Finally the Beast reveals that he is afraid of mice, which amuses his two companions until he retorts, &#34;At least I've seen one.  And there's one next to you right now.&#34;  In the next frame, Hamilton and Maggie are screeching and running around as the friendly little mouse scampers off, and this always gets our toddler laughing.  While I've had the same experience as another reviewer, of having my child frightened by a book or show meant to ward off fear, we did not have that experience with this book.  It is funny and enjoyable.<br /><br />The author uses a vocabulary surprisingly and pleasantly varied for this age-group.

He manages to balance whimsy and passion in a narrative voice that is authentically Everyman, and his descriptions are vivid and lush, whether he's depicting a character's apartment or a milieu in the past.  You won't find many more talented writers in any genre, and the fact that he's writing time paradoxes only increases your pleasure.<br />These 12 stories are a lot of fun.  While I think Finney, writing circa 1950s, excelled in the novel(la) format because he could fully indulge his gift for description, these shorts are enjoyable because they make great reads when you have less time -- in more ways than one.<br /><br />These stories were originally collected in two anthologies: The Third Level (1957/1976) and I Love Galesburg in the Springtime (1962), though those collections may be difficult to find.  All are great, but my favorites are: &#34;Such Interesting Neighbors&#34;, about the rather strange Hellenbek family who lives next door; &#34;Lunch-Hour Magic&#34;, about the lengths one will go to find love (or lust); &#34;The Face in the Photo&#34;, about a novel escape for criminals; and &#34;Of Missing Persons&#34;, about getting a second chance at Paradise.  &#34;The Third Level&#34; is a classic that you may well have read in other anthologies, and &#34;The Coin Collector&#34; was later expanded into novella-length &#34;The Woodrow Wilson Dime&#34; -- a treatment most of these wonderful stories could sustain.  The latter features a wonderful passage about books written by authors, including Mark Twain, who lived longer in the alternate reality in which the narrator finds himself.  Each story ends with a twist that would roll off Rod Serling's tongue.<br /><br />If you enjoy time travel stories (though not hard sf), great storytelling or endings with a wink, this is a collection you must have.  Finney is a marvel!  Give yourself a treat!	2003-03-13

It is a little less than that, since it does not contain information about specific knowledge your youngster &#34;needs&#34; to acquire (for that information, see The Core Knowledge series by E.D. Hirsch), but it is a marvelous book to impart the basics and instill in you a sense of confidence and enthusiasm regarding the adventure you are about to begin!<br /><br />Dobson begins with a survey of 66 homeschooling parents and presents continuum information about eight variables: motivation for homeschooling, financial expenditures, level of structuredness, assessment technique, technology use, physical space, parental involvement and outside assistance.  I found this interesting just to see what others were doing and, though not reported in great detail, I thought it was a promising way to begin the book.<br /><br />Chapters include information on getting ready to homeschool, curriculum options, teaching reading, teaching writing, teaching arithmetic, teaching other subjects, tailoring your approach to your family, resources, computers, accommodating younger learners, running a household (and sustaining a marriage) while you homeschool, part-time homeschooling, dealing with naysayers and enjoying the experience.  Each chapter ends with an outline of the major points and a list of resources, which may include books, programs, magazines, catalogues, web sites or organizations.  Chapters include practical advice as well as a series of personal anecdotes from the survey respondents called &#34;How We Did It&#34; with specific ideas that might be helpful.<br /><br />It would be simplistic to say that much of the book is cheerleading, as the author spends a lot of time telling you why this is a good idea, the benefits of your choice, and the positive effects this decision will have on your child(ren).  But considering how much grief you will probably get from relatives and acquaintances, someone to cheer you on isn't such a bad thing.  You won't rely on this volume for specifics, but it is inspirational and contains a lot of information about where to find more specifics.

Madeline is in the middle of professional litigation, love troubles and boredom brought on by her enforced unemployment.  She is invited to a posh wedding and plans to use the occasion to let wedding planner Vivian Duncan know that she really does not intend to take over Duncan's business -- until the planner turns up dead on the skeleton of a triceratops.  Enmeshed in the wedding and worried the police are after the wrong suspect, Madeline becomes active in her own investigation.<br />The mystery is fun and is resolved satisfactorily.  Maddie is an intelligent heroine and her charming colleagues, Wesley and Holly, are here also.

There are also a LOT of poems here, and some are better than others, as with all poetry.  This is a mix of contemporary (Fran Lebowitz, Billy Collins) and classic (Cervantes, Elizabeth Barret Browning) selections that explore reading, writing and books.  Artwork by Bascove is of a style consistent with the cover -- bold, colorful and primitive, sixteen paintings that also feature books.  A percentage of the profits go to First Book, a literacy program for children.<br /><br />I'd say the quality of the selections is uneven, but you will undoubtedly find something, and probably many things, that will please you.  This is a small volume that can be read quickly, or savored, and as an object it is very pleasing.  This would make a fine gift for a bibliophile you know.	2003-03-06

This edition dives into math, reading readiness and more challenging crafts.  Kudos to the author, who could have been lazy but wasn't!<br />The book is nicely organized and the author writes with humor and affection. A chapter of introduction helps you plan, supply and mentally prepare for those long days when you are running out of ideas, and  subsequent chapters organized projects into the following sections: Rainy Day Play; Kids in the Kitchen; Outdoor Adventures; Out and About; Reading, Writing, 'Rithmetic and More; Music, Dance and Drama; Arts and Crafts; and Birthdays and Holidays. Most activities are simple to set up, generally using two to four common household items. Appendices list recipes for basic paints, doughs, glues and clay; activities for a Crazy Can (a random drawing setup implementing activities that aren't messy and need little supervision); gifts children can make; best books for young children; and resources. The index lists projects (but not materials, which would be helpful in later editions).<br />The book subtitle, 365 Creative Games and Activities to Keep Your 3- to 6-Year-Old Busy, says it all.  I found quite a few good ideas in this well-organized, friendly guide.	2003-03-04

Her two sisters and a brother also work in the town and she is courted, somewhat reluctantly, by Patrick, a charming Irish fireman.  Her employers are kind, though the butler Mr. Williams is a bit of a tyrant, and things are generally good until Hilda and Patrick discover a murdered woman near the mansion.<br />There were a lot of things I liked about this book.  Hilda is an intelligent young woman who manages to work successfully in an oppressive environment, but she also has character flaws, like a stubborn streak and a bad temper, and that makes her believable.  Her friends and family are interesting, and Patrick is an admirable partner.<br />The mystery, however, was neither interesting nor explained well, though I trust other reviewers who like the author's work, and would give this series another try.	2003-03-04

Books	4	4	5	N	N	fine educational busy book for older kids	Organized alphabetically, each state has a full page that includes a road map of the state, a puzzle, a pictorial showing the state's location in the US, and the following information: capital city, state flower, state tree, state bird, and year admitted to the Union.  The puzzles vary -- there are word search, letter manipulation, crossword, matching, connect the dot, word scramble, coloring, maze and hidden picture puzzles, among others.  A center two-page spread shows a simplified road atlas of the United States.  Puzzles and maps are in color.  The book concludes with pages for Canada and Mexico; an index to cities, towns and places organized by state; and Answer Pages.<br />Caveat: While this is an excellent busy book, the cover states it is suitable for ages 4 and up.  Amazon's recommendation of ages 9-12 is closer to the mark, but younger puzzle or geography/travel fans will enjoy it as well.	2003-03-01

And he reveals some interesting information about pre-presidential Jimmy Carter!<br /><br />If you love books, you will thoroughly enjoy these observations.  But beware!  When you are finished you will have drawn up a LONG list of books that you did not know existed but which you cannot now live without.<br /><br />Stimulating.  Thought-provoking.  Fun.

A friend knows he is interested in faces and brings him a pile of portraits, one of which triggers his interest in the reputed murder of the Little Princes by their uncle Richard, the last Plantagenet to sit on the throne of England.  Faced with a disparity between his perception of the man and his reported actions, Grant finds himself compelled to investigate the murders, albeit from a hospital bed four hundred years away.<br />I had heard about this book for years and finally got round to reading it.  I am so glad I did.  It is a fun armchair mystery about a fascinating subject, Tey introduces enough refutory information to make you want to learn more about Richard III, and all of the characters -- from protagonist Grant to affable walk-ons -- are vivid and memorable.<br />A real pleasure to read.	2003-02-25

After a friendly introduction in which the author discusses various methods of reading instruction, the book contains the clues and solutions for 50 treasure hunts!  Just tear out the pages, fold them and place them in the appropriate spots.  For example, Treasure Hunt 1: Clue 1 tells you to \\"Look under a pan\\", Clue 2 reads \\"Look under your bed\\", Clue 3 says \\"Look under the bath mat\\" and the solution page reads \\"Great.  You did it!  Come get your sticker.\\"  There are even 50 stickers at the back of the book (the idea of the author's son, who contributes a charming introduction as well).  Each solution also has a bonus game of matching words to pictures, and successive hunts get more challenging in length and vocabulary.<br />This is a terrific idea, well executed and thought out.  Who doesn't love a treasure hunt?  You'll undoubtedly be looking for a sequel or be inspired to construct your own treasure hunts when you finish these fifty exercises.<br />Excellent resource.	2003-02-25

The large but lightweight book comes with a \\"working\\" drawbridge on the cover, and is tied with two blue ribbons. You can \\"read\\" the book and let each of the four segments (including throne room, dining room, exterior, armory and bedrooms) appear individually, or you can unfold the house and tie the ribbons with the book covers back-to-back so that the castle is completely accessible as a sort of diorama. Your preschooler boy or girl will have hours of low-tech fun playing with the punch-out characters: king, queen, knights on horses, a jester, a wizard, lady, lord and dragon.<br />There are hanging banners, a sliding front gate, balconies, connecting doors, chandeliers, chess games, closets, hidden jewels, pop-up furniture and more. There are loads of fun little surprises here -- even a hidden passage. My advice: get this even for a little child who may tear the admittedly fragile cardboard pieces. You can always tape or glue them together, or buy another castle, but you can't always find a fun setup for little ones that requires imagination more than batteries, allowing children to act out stories in an exciting play environment.	2003-02-19
1222973:US	52753467	RJ7Y83UD1C41F	0446612790	309666534	2nd Chance (Women's Murder Club)	Books	3	6	6	N	Y	disappointing sequel in this promising series	This second book in the Women's Murder Club series was okay -- entertaining enough and a quick read -- but I had really enjoyed the first in the series, 1st to Die, and was looking forward to this sequel.  I was disappointed, though, finding this installment less thrilling and less engaging. The murders and solution were less interesting; whereas 1st to Die had lots of twists and revelations, this has one twist that's not really very surprising, and there is no mystery to speak of -- a straightforward motive that precludes any tension building as the case proceeds.  Also, perhaps because the author assumes you've read the first book, he doesn't bother to devote much space to character development, which is unfortunate since it is the friendship and abilities of detective Lindsay Boxer and her friends, the D.A., the reporter and the coroner, that make the series interesting.  The appearance of Lindsay's absentee father is a nice touch, though, and adds to our understanding of her character.<br />Less forgivable is that characters make silly mistakes.  For example, Lindsay decides to follow a dangerous suspect into an unknown, dark location knowing that her cell phone battery is dead and that no one knows where she is. Ouch.  How is that consistent with the main character being intelligent?  Another, less critical but still annoying, mistake -- characters refer to \\"Zena the Warrior Woman\\".  Do they mean \\"Xena, Warrior Princess\\" perhaps?  Did anybody proof this?  Print is large, chapters are short, and there's lots of white space -- it's nominally 400 pages, but is probably only about 250.  All-in-all, this is a moderately enjoyable pseudo-thriller that may leave you feeling a bit short-changed.  Just my opinion, but I recommend buying it used or checking it out from the library.	2003-02-19

Separated into chapters about frying, produce, eggs, starches, meats and doughs, approximately a dozen pages of explanatory text is followed by a chapter synopsis and then recipes.<br />There were more recipes than I'd expected, and sometimes these seemed to be chosen more for illustrating the principles discussed than for being appetizing, but there are also quite a few delicious-sounding recipes and the several that I've tried so far have been winners.  If you love goat cheese, salmon or lamb, as the author seems to, you will find a LOT to do!<br />All-in-all, I thoroughly enjoyed the fascinating and lucid text, and learned a lot.  The author writes well and explains the science of cooking in a clear manner.  The recipes are a mixed bag, but there are so many that you will undoubtedly find a number that will be of interest.  Bon appetit!	2003-02-14

The first page I flipped to had an idea for a simple game that I put together in two minutes and had us all laughing for twenty.  Bless you, Trish Kuffner!<br />This book is nicely organized.  A chapter of introduction helps you plan, supply and mentally prepare for those long days when you are running out of ideas. The author writes with humor and affection.  Subsequent chapters are organized into Rainy Day Play, Kids in the Kitchen, Water Play, Outdoor Adventures, Out and About, Nursery Rhymes and Finger Plays, Early Learning Fun, Music and Movement, Arts and Crafts, and Holidays.  Most activities are simple to set up, generally using about three or four household items.  Appendices list recipes for basic paints, doughs, glues and clay; a list of activities for a Crazy Can (a random drawing of activities that aren't messy and need little supervisoin so you can, for example, get dinner ready); best toys for babies and toddlers; best books for same; and resources.

Each day has a two-page spread for the traditional hours of prayer/meditation: midnight/matins, sunrise/lauds, 6 am/prime, 9 am/terce, noon/sext, 3 pm/none, sunset/vespers and 9 pm/compline. Each spread features, on the left page, one or two quotations or poems about the soul, our relationship to nature, etc. These inspirational thoughts come from philosophers, poets, novelists and many others, and the name, nationality and dates of birth and death are given. The right page contains a small picture, usually of a person, with the location identified.<br />This book is very similar to The Soul Aflame by the same collaborators and published in 2000.  This volume is a little smaller, and though the setup is the same, the quotes are different and the pictures here tend to feature natural settings rather than people .<br />This book is lovely for yourself or as a gift to someone who is troubled or in need of solace or inspiration. It's a way to reconnect with those ideas and thoughts that you used to have but so often get pushed aside when one begins to worry about career, mortgages, totalitarian governments and all the rest.<br />Find some peace. Find this book.	2003-02-12

I dearly love Chicago, and some of the old photographs were very interesting, but the book has a few problems.  First, the photographic perspectives are rarely in synch, so it is difficult to compare the two pictures directly; either the angle is off to the side, or it's at a different distance.  This seems rather to defeat the purpose of a &#34;then and now&#34; theme, which is to facilitate comparison.  Secondly, a great many of the buildings and scenes are virtually identical to what they were, so one wonders why they were included.  Finally, a map should have been included.<br /><br />On the positive side, many of Chicago's key spots are targeted, such as the Water Tower, the stockyards and Hull House, and the paragraphs that accompany each picture do convey a lot of interesting information.<br /><br />If you are interested in Chicago or urban history you will undoubtedly still enjoy this volume, but lower your expectations a bit before the book arrives so you won't be disappointed.	2003-02-12

This is a book that can be browsed through many times; you'll always find some new detail to make you laugh or an insight that takes your breath away. Every detail, from headlines to advertisements, is hilarious:<br /><br />04/13/1916  -- Cubist Regiment Decimated -- skewed perspective, lack of depth prove liability as non-linear soldiers are mercilessly cut down<br />07/20/1925 -- Scopes Monkey Trial Raises Troubling Question: Is Science Being Taught in Our Schools?<br />01/22/1990 -- Berlin Wall Destroyed in Doritos-Sponsored Super Bowl Halftime Spectacular<br />01/10/1998 -- Educators Praised As U.S. Kids Lead World in Schoolyard Shooting Accuracy<br /><br />Many items are inspired one-liners, but a number enjoy lengthy front page stories that sustain the mood and the level of comedy. Ads, announcements, tv and radio schedules, cartoons and graphics are equally enjoyable. Count how many times Lady Liberty is ravaged by heathen outsiders!<br /><br />A minor complaint: The only thing that would have made this book more enjoyable is an index so you could find your favorite targets more easily, but the writers have brought me so much laughter I could forgive them anything. A gentle warning: Don't leave this in the loo or you will never get in there!<br /><br />Splendid. Righteous. Brilliant.	2003-02-07

A pie is in the oven.  Clothes hang in the closet.  A toilet with a lid that raises.  There are loads of fun little surprises here.  My advice: get this even for a little child who may tear the cardboard pieces.

I'd hoped for a book full of beautiful photographs of large old trees, and it is that, indeed.  It is also a bit less than I'd hoped, being trees only of the United Kingdom, and I would dearly love to have this author give a similar treatment to the gentle giants inhabiting other parts of the world.<br />It is also much more than I'd expected, being filled with enchanting stories of the 60 (groups of) trees Pakenham has chosen to introduce.  Each tree (group) is beautifully photographed, often with people nearby so you can get a sense of their immensity, and the images are accompanied by a few pages of text filled with delightful anecdotes and histories.<br />Making the book even more valuable for travellers is a gazetteer with a map of the UK showing each tree's location as well as information regarding its common name, scientific name, full measurements and accessibilty to the public.  Unfortunately none of the sixty are located in Wales, but there are 8 in Ireland, 10 in Scotland and 42 in England, including 10 in the London area.  The book is interspersed with olde line drawings, and the book concludes with a bibliography, credits for the illustrations and a good index.<br />If you love trees or travel to Great Britain, you will want to meet this remarkable book.  Highest recommendation.	2003-01-31

This is a charming story, less an epic than a good old-fashioned tale, as Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin Oakenshield and the rest trek to the Lonely Mountain to wrest dwarvish gold from the dragon Smaug. Along the way they encounter Beorn the Bear-Man, elves, trolls and giant spiders.<br /><br />This edition is quite beautiful, and would make a lovely gift for someone who has read the story and considers it something special.

Through fire, ignorance and greed many of the country's most beautiful buildings have been lost. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the merchant princes and the stockyards, George Pullman and Hull House's Jane Addams, Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright, the Columbian Exposition. These people and events shaped what few would neglect to identify as one of America's architectural centers.<br /><br />This beautiful book is filled with more than 200 black-and-white photographs of buildings, bridges and other structures tragically allowed to fall into disrepair, destroyed by natural disaster, or bulldozed for parking lots and malls, repeated testaments to the Gordon Curve, predicting that a building is valued most when it is new, that it is least valued and most likely to be razed at approximately 70 years of age, and that if it makes it past that nadir it will begin to rise again in value as a relic and monument.<br /><br />Each chapter is preceded by several well-written and accessible pages, and each photograph is accompanied by informative paragraphs and quotes. The author delves into Chicago's beginnings as a frontier fort and its rapid growth into a bustling mercantile hive, along the way outlining the history of the peoples and policies of various times from 1803 to the 1970s, organized into ten conceptual and functional groups such as residences, hotels, railway stations, churches, arthouses, The Fire and the fairs.<br /><br />The photographs are wonderful, many I've never seen before, and each is described well, though the book would benefit by containing more maps. The book is constructed of good heavyweight paper and concludes with picture sources and notes, and a good index. It should be of interest to those with some connection to Chicago, architecture or American history, particularly of the 18th and 19th century.ry.	2003-01-27

That much is easy for anyone to see. What made this book more interesting is the author's contention that there has also been a change in the Left's priorities, evidenced by the rise of neoliberalism (Carter, Clinton and the DLC, for example) and the shift from working class and immigrant concerns to that of identity politics. What remains is a gaping void where middle class working folks reside -- moderate-to-conservative on social issues and liberal on economics -- left-populists. Essentially, both parties are looking out for the economic concerns of corporations and the affluent, while each does its best to appeal to various special interests in order to get votes. When is the last time either political party decided to strengthen employees' rights, keep jobs in this country, reward workers for having the best productivity in the world, or eliminate the obscenity of a class of working poor?<br /><br />It was interesting to read this book post-9/11. I expected a lot of it would be outdated and made irrelevant by that awful morning, but much of what the author said then still rings true, though at the time of writing he had no inkling (who could?) of GW and the 2000 election debacle to come. Lind discusses the religious right's stranglehold on the GOP even without knowing that they would sabotage John McCain with a disinformation campaign in South Carolina in 2000. He traces the myths of the success of supply-side economics and the failures of the public schools and social welfare even before knowing that the Bush administration would bankrupt the country for upper-income tax cuts and push faith-based programs and school vouchers through the back door. He denounces the whacko anti-Semitic, homophobic, misogynistic, irrational rantings of Pat Robertson that conservatives allow to go unchallenged because he controls a vast grass-roots network of voters. (This is what finally led him to renounce his own conservative affiliations.) But my favorite chapter has to be the one attacking the conservative myth of the Golden Age (the 1950s for Newt Gingrich, the 1930s for Trent Lott). It is very funny. Tragically, scandalously funny.<br /><br />Lind calls attention to the hypocrisy of conservatives who call for law and order (at the same time they let the NRA halt even the most basic controls on weapons), smaller government (at the same time they establish the department of Total Information Awareness headed by situational ethicist John Poindexter), fiscal responsibility (at the same time they dip into Social Security in order to give tax breaks to the top 1%), pro-family (at the same time they tax families to give tax breaks to the rich), and non-intervention (at the same time they send young people off to die in order to divert attention from a poor economy and constitutional shenanigans).<br /><br />Lind, most interestingly, makes the case that the GOP has shifted from American conservatism to southern conservatism, with its concomitant anti-intellectual, anti-government, pro-industry and separatist attitudes; at the same time, corporations have shifted from a pro-government (investment) model to a low-wage/non-regulation model favored by conservatives.<br /><br />This is a big-picture book that will give you a lot to think about. If you are a curious and honest thinker, of any political persuasion, you will find this treatise, at the very least, thought-provoking.<br />The title's implication that current conservatism is bottom-of-the-barrel politics is bookended by the work's final lines: &#34;It is too late to rescue American conservatism from the radical right. But it is not too late to rescue America from conservatism.&#34; You gotta love that.<br /><br />An excellent companion book would be David Brock's Blinded by the Right. While Lind looks at the philosophical underpinnings of conservative thought, Brock's emphasis is on the evolution of the conservative movement since the 1980's and on specific individuals and the media.mphasis is on the evolution of the conservative movement since the 1980's and on specific individuals and the media.	2003-01-24

His voice is clear, resonant and beautiful, and he has created unique voices for each character -- even the fourteen dwarves.  He could relate the dialogue with no intervening narration and you would be able to tell who is speaking!  In addition, he lends animation to the text, not reading in a dry style, but with appropriate inflection, humor and drama.

This large book contains fourteen two-page foldouts, approx. 14 inches high by 19 inches across, and each picture is packed with informative, and often humorous, images, labels and text, surrounded by a decorative border.  The fourteen \\"maps and  sketches of lost worlds and mysterious places\\" are: the Garden of Eden; Atlantis; Noah's Ark; the Tower of Babel; Ancient Egypt, depicting the construction of a necropolis for Ramses II; King Solomon's Mines; Homer's Odyssey; Man Against Woman, showing a gladiatorial combat between men and women that took place in Pompeii two days before it was destroyed by Vesuvius; the Seven Cities of Gold; Sherwood Forest inhabited by Robin Hood and his merry men; King Arthur and his knights; Genghis Khan and the Great Wall of China; Dracula's castle; and Conan Doyle's Dinosaur Island.<br />Each pre-folded out page has several paragraphs of explanatory text that are intriguing and funny.  A flat magnifier is attached to the book by a ribbon.  The end pages show maps, explorer's tools and silly photographs of the author on his treks, while the book cover looks like Prof. Al Lorenz's travel-worn satchel.<br />This is a fun concept-book, well-executed and a pleasure for readers (of any age) who are adventurers at heart.	2003-01-12

He is also a traitor.  Now, a guest in Lord and Lady Madderly's castle, he has been murdered, though no one seems terribly upset about his loss.  Enter Susanna, Lady Appleton, and her half-sister-in-law Catherine, enjoined by the Queen to visit Madderly Castle to assist its Lady with her herbal. Coincidence?  Susanna thinks not, but that does not keep her from trying to solve this, and subsequent, murders.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the first novel in this series, but did not like this one so well.  The mystery was not as interesting, and the fact that Susanna was not at home hurt the entertainment value, I thought, particularly since it meant that her companion and confidante became half-sister Catherine rather than the feisty, outspoken Jennet from that first outing.<br />The author writes well about herbs and the times, informing us effortlessly of things we might not otherwise know, but while this was a pleasant read, it was a letdown from the first, though I'll probably try another in the series.	2003-01-12

Pictures, maps and photographs are black & white, and are interspersed throughout the book, organized into subjects such as signs, spires, schools, etc.  The text is arranged chronologically, and is generally well-written and highly accessible.  The author delves into the history, policies and people of various times from 1630 to the present day.<br /><br />Many of the buildings and areas depicted are truly beautiful, some destroyed as recently as the 1970s, when you'd think people would have known better.  Scenes after the fire of November 1872 make you want to cry.  I have a fair number of pictorial histories of The Hub, and still found some pictures in here that I hadn't seen elsewhere, and the author's perspective is worthwhile reading.<br /><br />The book is constructed of high quality paper and concludes with picture credits, a selected bibliography and a good index.

She tells her story with wit and humour, and interjects sly digs that engender a wink and a smile, but while the premise is timeless and interesting, the prose is extremely dated, making the book a bit tedious to read for any length of time. Also, the ideas and prejudices exhibited by the characters date the material.<br />The five siblings of the title, who have found a Sand-fairy willing to grant them one wish a day, continually make silly wishes that get them into trouble. Their first wish is to be \\"as beautiful as the day\\". Right there you get a sense of the book's outdated charm. This is of interest more as a tribute to a talented children's writer of a bygone era rather than for its own sake.<br />I wanted to enjoy this classic, but I found it hard slogging through. That is just my opinion, however, but I'd suggest you read a bit of the text before purchasing it unless you're already familiar with, or particularly interested in, author Nesbit.<br />Caveat: The occasional black-and-white line drawings are by H.R. Millar, not the Paul Zelinsky watercolors promised in the Editorial Reviews section.	2003-01-11

The site depicted is an area near a waterway, presumably in the English midlands, and the eras shown are 10,000 BCE, showing a winter settlement of Stone Age hunters; 2000 BCE, an early farming settlement; 600 BCE, the Iron Age; AD 100, during Roman occupation; 600, after the collapse of Roman civilization to barbarian invaders; 900, after the Viking raids; 1200s, a medieval village; 1400s, a medieval town; 1500s, during the Bubonic Plague; 1600s, during a time of religious wars; 1700s, the Regency period; early 1800s, the beginning of industrialization; late 1800s, a thriving city; and finally, a modern city.

Our narrator is at the site of the first chronolith's appearance and is involved thereafter, through acquaintances and his job, in trying to understand their significance and their effect on the world.<br />Wilson is a fine writer, but ultimately this book was disappointing. I kept waiting for some revelation about Kuin, but we never even find out for sure who it is, as if the author intends to write a sequel. Though the narrator is reminiscing from a future after Kuin has made his conquests, we never learn who it is or hear about any of the events commemorated in the chronoliths. Scott Warden is a likeable and complex protagonist, but a majority of the narration, being his discussion of his relationships with his wife, ex-wife, daughter and colleagues, could be transplanted into any novel of any genre. The discussions about the chronoliths themselves are vague jargon-y monologues by Scott's employer, who we are told is brilliant, but every time she begins an explanation someone cuts her off because they won't be able to understand what she is telling them and, in a pivotal scene, she describes events such as Scott's presence at various \\"arrivals\\" as significantly coincidental when in fact she often controlled events that precipitated those occurrences.<br />I suppose what I found most disappointing was the difference in scale -- the premise sounds so grand and magnificent, but the trip we take with Warden is mundane and peripheral. It's as if you were fortunate enough to be in Paris when Napoleon rode through the streets, but you were two blocks over and taking a nap -- something fascinating was happening nearby, but you didn't see a thing; Warden is supposedly in the thick of things *and* writing from a future perspective, yet we still never find out who Kuin is or what brought him/her to power, etc. Instead we gets lots of hand-wringing comments of the we-are-all-doomed and will-your-children's-children-ever-laugh-again variety.<br />I wanted to like this book, but I was disappointed.

The first two-page spread puts the city into a textual and graphic context.  The second spread depicts a building or the city being described, and these illustrations are dense with activity revealed more acutely with cross-sections, blow-ups and detail.  An illustrated timeline of the century also runs along the border of these two pages.  The final spread explains the centerpiece illustration and offers more detail of some aspect of the time.  For example, Paris in the 12th Century first describes the Middle Ages and the history of Paris, and explains why so many cathedrals were built in this era, accompanied by a map of Europe showing many of them; the centerpiece illustration shows the construction of Notre Dame, with details of smiths, roofers, masons and carvers at work, and a timeline along the border that shows 22 other significant events of the century, such as the death of Omar Khayyam, an appearance of Halley's Comet, the birth of Genghis Khan, the murder of Thomas a Becket, the ascension of Richard the Lion-Hearted to the English throne and the construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa; finally, a description of the cathedral work is given along with detailed text and illustrations of Notre Dame's carvings and stained glass, including the Rose Window.<br /><br />The text is informative and detailed, though this is a supplement to history texts and not a substitute, with an emphasis on how people of the time lived and worked.  The cities chosen are historically and culturally significant:  Jerusalem of the 11th century with a discussion of religion and the Crusades; Paris of the 12th century, with a discussion of the cathedrals of Europe; a Mongol tent city of the 13th century; 14th century Koblenz, with a discussion of the Plague;  Lisbon and Mozambique of the 15th century; 16th century Florence, with a discussion of Renaissance art and learning; Osaka of the 17th century, with a discussion of Kabuki and No theatre; Vienna of the 18th century; 19th century London; and 20th century New York, emphasizing its immigrant populations.<br /><br />If you are a history buff, or have a child studying history, this lush book will add dimension to your/their understanding.

The text is horrid, and I was surprised to see that the author has written a number of books. This is like an early Hallmark card. The poetry is not good -- \\"Friendship is a simple thing, The clue is just to start, As long as it is built on trust, And love from in your heart\\". Nice idea, but do you want to read 30+ pages of this? There is no story and apparently the only reason to own and enjoy this book is if you know someone named Bob. But the thing is, I know some Bobs, and they deserve a better book than this! Who is Bob? What makes him tick? What does Bob the magical snowman ever do in this book besides tell you to remember him, without ever doing anything worth remembering? Bob makes Frosty look like the hero in a Russian epic.<br /><br />The art, on the other hand, is charming -- nostalgic folk and traditional themes in blue, rose and gold tones. The font is large and lovely, and the book is physically nice, right down to the tone and weight of the paper and the cover-art box. The artist wisely, else we should miss it, puts a scroll around the only actual words that issue forth from Bob, including \\"I hope it snows a'plenty so I might stay and share, in all your loving friendship, your thoughtful, tender care\\".  Ouch.<br /><br />In looking at the author's works, I notice he has worked with a number of illustrators, and I notice that Ms. Crouch has lived in Pennsylvania, Illinois and Wisconsin. THAT is more of a story than is contained in this badly-written poem. I intend to look for more books by illustrator Crouch and steer clear of author Moulton. There are much better children's winter books out there. I bet a few even have a character named Bob.<br /><br />And how about this:<br /><br />Whose woods these are I think I know,<br />His house is in the village, though;<br />He will not see me stopping here<br />To watch his woods fill up with snow.<br /><br />My little horse must think it queer<br />To stop without a farmhouse near<br />Between the woods and frozen lake<br />The darkest evening of the year.<br /><br />He gives his harness bells a shake<br />To ask if there is some mistake.<br />The only other sound's the sweep<br />Of easy wind and downy flake.<br /><br />The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,<br />But I have promises to keep,<br />And miles to go before I sleep,<br />And miles to go before I sleep.<br /><br />Now THAT'S a poem -- and it's by a guy named Bob Frost. Spooky.y little horse must think it queer<br />To stop without a farmhouse near<br />Between the woods and frozen lake<br />The darkest evening of the year.<br /><br />He gives his harness bells a shake<br />To ask if there is some mistake.<br />The only other sound's the sweep<br />Of easy wind and downy flake.<br /><br />The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,<br />But I have promises to keep,<br />And miles to go before I sleep,<br />And miles to go before I sleep.<br /><br />Now THAT'S a poem -- and it's by a guy named Bob Frost.

Each of eight animals is given a double-page spread that includes a large pull-tab that reveals the animal in a natural setting; a large lift-the-flap that reveals the animal's identity, picture and several well-chosen paragraphs of interesting information; and a 2-3 second push-button recording with decent sound quality -- the sounds are authentic but a little fuzzy.  The eight animals are the coyote, spring peeper, great horned owl, American toad,  whippoorwill, field cricket, bullfrog and katydid -- one mammal, two birds, three amphibians and two insects.<br />This is the kind of book that excites children's interest in nature.

Within the framework of 16 two-page spreads about kids from different times and places, the authors present a good deal of historical information.  This is the kind of book that will help young readers determine what is the same about being human and what changes over time and distance, and may well spark an interest in a particular period or history in general.<br /><br />The book begins with a world map placing the sixteen children who will be featured, and then each child is shown (in chronological order) with a short paragraph of autobiographical text.  Typical pages show the layout of a house, toys, school, and a miscellany of topics interesting to other children such as play, health, transportation, cooking or music.  The emphasis is on colorful illustration and graphic depictions.  Periods covered are Egypt 1200 BC, Athens 500 BC, China 150 BC, Rome AD 120, Norway AD 950, Mali, West Africa 1400, Spain 1450, Florence 1490, Mexico 1500, India 1600, Japan 1650, Australia 1700, France 1789, England 1840, Plains Indians 1850 and the United States 1920.<br /><br />The book finishes with a short discussion of archaeology and history, a simplified timeline and a glossary.<br /><br />This is another beautiful book from Dorling Kindersley, and a worthwhile introduction/supplement to your child's history lessons.	2002-12-26

There are about 50 reusable vinyl stickers that can be placed on four scenes -- two-page spreads showing the park in summer and in winter and two one-page views of the Eiffel tower area and Madeline's hospital room.  The stickers feature Madeline, the other girls, Miss Clavell and Pepito in various attires and performing a variety of activities, miscellaneous characters from the Paris milieu, and accessories like balloons, a kite and a snowman.  The book also contains the complete Madeline poem by Ludwig Bemelmans, simple instructions on how to draw Madeline herself and one each of a hidden word, fill-in-the-blank, matching, hidden picture, maze and crossword puzzle as well as one page for coloring.

A multitude of black-and-white line drawings illustrate the story of Roman urban planners as they design and construct a new city on the Roman empire's frontier.  Every stage is explained thoroughly using text, illustrations and charts, from developing a master plan through construction.  Tools are explained, cross-sections are used to good effect and specific projects such as a house, a road, a bridge and aqueduct, the forum and central market, public baths, the sewer system and an amphitheater and theater are represented.  The book ends with a one-page glossary.  If you or a student you know is interested in Roman engineering, this would be a marvelous book to read.	2002-12-17

Seventeen specimens are discussed, each featured in a chapter that relates the tree's historic significance, botanical description and instructions for propagation and placement of the tree.  There is one color photograph of each of the seventeen trees, with many small black-and-white photos and drawings.  Initially I was disappointed that the book did not take more pains to represent these trees more lovingly with good color photography, but the inspiration is in the text and the companion project, and one is struck by the brilliant simplicity of Meyer's idea for preserving these lovely old giants.	2002-12-17

Allusions abound, from Conan Doyle and Sayles to Wilde, Wodehouse and Wilkie Collins.<br /><br />The format is fun, with humorous introductory quotes and chapter outlines that pique the reader's curiosity.  The pacing is fine, though the book runs long.  I enjoyed each of the characters, from Ned Henry and Verity Kindle, to Finch and Terence, Professor Peddick and Baine, and Cyril and Princess Arjumand, though I thought the plot resolutions were fairly transparent (and I'm not usually good at figuring things out in advance).  In addition to a thick layer of chaos theory, this literary casserole also slathers on lots of historical speculation -- namely, the role of penmanship, disease, sleep, weather, murder, assumptions, fire and swans on historical events.  So, while it's not perfect, it is a book that works on many levels -- as comedy, as satire, as speculative fiction.  It will wake up your brain AND entertain you, though you might gain some enjoyment from reading &#34;Three Men in a Boat&#34; before picking it up.	2002-12-17

There is plenty of text here (which can sometimes be a failing of pop-up books), presented within miniature booklets on each page, and these mini-books have pop-ups themselves, which may be less ambitious than the seven centerpiece artworks, but are quite beautiful and clever in their own right.  The text matches Baum's book rather than the movie, so you will find that the witch uses a magic cap to summon the Winged Monkeys, and Dorothy inherit's the Wicked Witch's silver shoes rather than ruby slippers.<br />There are no pull-tabs and nothing for you to do other than enjoy Sabuda's artistry as a cyclone ascends over the Kansas prairie, the Munchkins approach Dorothy's house in Munchkinland, a field of red poppies appears to put some of the travellers to sleep, the Emerald City (complete with green spectacles!) rises from the page, the Wicked Witch's castle emerges, Oz's balloon takes off and Glinda greets the adventurers in the country of the long-necked Quadlings.<br />This would be a fabulous introduction to the story for older youngsters or a fine collectible.  Really beautiful.	2002-12-16

It deals mainly with issues of childhood anxieties, and if these are not already problems for your child, they may become so.  I've found that sometimes books or television shows produce problems when nominally they propose to help.  Our toddler was not afraid of monsters and didn't dislike vegetables until he saw these problems in fictional characters.<br />That said, if your child DOES have anxieties about their first day of school, visiting the doctor or  nightmares, these stories featuring familiar characters can be comforting and give you the vocabulary to help  your child.	2002-12-15

It features a little Muppet boy who has been learning to use a potty seat.  The youngster talks about how happy he is to be a big boy and wear pants and go potty by himself.  He interrupts play, takes down his pants, sits on the potty and \\"goes\\", wipes, flushes, pulls up his pants and washes his hands before going back to play, where his friend and toys are waiting to pick up where they left off.<br />The book features a potty seat that sits on the big toilet rather than a free-standing potty chair, and no phrases for defecation or urination are used.  A good choice for families in this interesting phase of development.	2002-12-13

Posters are separated into Dogs, Cats, Birds and Others; the latter category includes rabbits, cows, hamsters, rats, snakes and ferrets.  Posters range from those drawn by children to those displaying sophisticated wit and/or design, and represent fugitives in the US, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Europe, Japan and Africa.  Each entry is on one page that shows the poster with the location identified beneath it.  Facing pages make a flip drawing of pets walking across the page, and the book concludes with the author's Missing Pet Poster Tips and some factoids.<br /><br />The book is more interesting in premise than selection, I thought.  Some were poignant but many were not.  Still, I'm glad I got this -- the picture of dour cat &#34;Pudding&#34; is almost worth getting the book by itself! -- and it would make a fun gift for pet lovers you know.	2002-12-12

When I looked it up in the thesaurus, Definition 2 (It did not seem to be the \\"athletic, brawny\\" of Definition 1.) lists as synonyms \\"durable, serviceable, strongly-made, well-made\\" and an opposite of \\"weak\\". So I would say the book is robust. Though I didn't find \\"robust\\" under \\"durable\\" or \\"serviceable\\", it can be found under \\"strong\\" but not \\"well\\", neither \\"strongly-made\\" nor \\"well-made\\", being combinatorial forms, appearing. Word entries are arranged simply -- alphabetically -- and entries list each word's part of speech, synonyms, related words, at least one antonym and sometimes illustrative phrases and referrals. Synonyms are listed alphabetically rather than commonest first. The 55-page Reverse Dictionary Supplement will be helpful to those who regularly trawl for words, containing as it does alternative terms, combinatorial forms, common phrase forms, etc. Using abbreviations, markers and examples, a wealth of information is contained in each pithy entry. There are no tables or charts. There is a worthy and brief introduction by compiler Alan Spooner, but nowhere could I discover how many entries are in this edition. The book itself is a pleasing size to fit in one's hand, open or shut, and it is lightweight. A quite useful resource for those who work or play with words.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-12-07

The book starts with a three-page introduction for parents, discussing readiness and approach. The text for children is comforting and informative -- letting kids know that there was a time that parents did everything for them but now they are growing up, and using the toilet is another aspect of their growth, like dressing or feeding themselves. Cartoon pictures show a little boy using a potty seat and his older siblings using the adult toilet seat. An older boy urinates standing up, and handwashing is shown. Sidebars on most pages address questions that children might ask with suggested answers. The process is emphatically positive though constipation and accidents are also mentioned. The book concludes with a page about attachment parenting.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the use of the terms &#34;pee-pee&#34; and &#34;poo-poo&#34; but that's easy enough to change as you read. The message is comforting at the same time the text is informative for kids, discussing the mechanics of the process as well as the benefits.<br /><br />There is also a pull-out poster that shows the steps involved, and this can be placed on the bathroom wall or maybe in a spot your youngster tends to seek out when s/he feels the need to go potty.<br /><br />Excellent.	2002-12-04

Forster, Joseph Conrad, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Leonard Elmore, Louis L'Amour, Joseph Heller, Jane Smiley etc.  A wonderful selection.<br /><br />The book would be great if it ended there, but further sections list literary award winners, the best of genre fiction, &#34;best of&#34; lists from The Modern Library and The New York Public Library, readers' resources (including those found online), information about reading groups, audiobooks, catalogues, used books, e-books, sources for book reviews and a list of national and state book festivals.  Each section is exhaustive and well-organized.<br /><br />An excellent index includes even those authors listed as suggestions, and highlights featured authors in bold type.<br /><br />Just wonderful, if a bit dangerous.  Highest recommendation.	2002-12-04

This is the second of the Madeline Bean Culinary Mystery series, and this one is just as engaging as the first.  Madeline and her colleagues have been slated to prepare a 2000-person breakfast for the pontiff, but they are nothing if not ambitious, managing to take on a murderer, an exhibitionist star, a parchment that may be a confession to murder, and even go out on the town a few times!  The characters are very entertaining -- problem-solving Madeline, her omniscient partner Wes, their goofy employee Holly and her Donald (who has just written a successful screenplay), and Maddie's part-time beau Arlo.  There is a lot of activity here, a bit of Hollywood name-dropping, colorful portraits of the star lifestyle we love to ridicule, and even a decent mystery.  Do yourself a favor and check out this delightful series by  talented author Jerrilyn Farmer.	2002-12-04

With that in mind, this book is a wonderful overview of a fascinating metropolis, beginning with the formation of the land mass and continuing through its inhabitance by the Manahatta, the Dutch, the Brits and the Americans.  Key historical eras are covered including the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, and many areas of interest are addressed such as immigration, politics, sports, the arts and architecture.<br /><br />There are many photographs, drawings, charts and maps, and I appreciated that the scales were similar so that a reader can compare various maps easily.<br /><br />Articles are well-written and graphics are clean and well-designed.  I would call this more an historical almanac of NYC, but whatever you call it, it is a fun and interesting read.	2002-12-04

An Important Pop-up Book	Books	4	7	10	N	Y	humorous and fun introduction to using the potty seat	This 10-page pull-tab book is a funny introduction to using the potty seat. Cartoons of a little boy ask 'What do you do with a potty?' and 'What goes in the potty?' Pull-tabs show the boy pulling down his pants and sitting on the little seat, pulling out the toilet paper and emptying the pot into the big toilet.<br />The mood is upbeat and fun, the format is engaging for children. Terms used are 'poopy' and 'tinkle'. Handwashing is not mentioned.<br />This is a happy little book that should be used in conjunction with other, more informative books, such as Sears' \\"You Can Go To the Potty\\".	2002-12-04

Though there was quite a bit of corporate/business jargon that went right past me, the author did a good job of establishing an interesting set of characters -- some in depth and some kept mysterious until later in the story -- and setting an atmosphere filled with tension.  Three executives at a Seattle ad agency are attempting to buy out their boss's interest in the company, and he tells them he will do so IF they all complete a seminar that he regards highly.  Right away you wonder if the seminar is legitimate, what the boss has planned, etc.  As the seminar progresses you, like the participants, begin to wonder what is real and what is staged, and who you can trust and who you can't.<br />The writing and plotting are very well done and I, like other reviewers, stayed up late so I could finish it -- which is the mark of a successful thriller, right?  I thought the ending was somewhat less than satisfying, but certainly exciting.<br />I would recommend this book to a friend who enjoys thrillers, especially if they're an MBA.	2002-11-27

The subjects alone are enough to bring a smile to any \\"common reader\\", a phrase used by Virginia Woolf (and borrowed from Samuel Johnson) to connote an educated layperson who reads for pleasure rather than scholarship or criticism.  Ms. Fadiman turns a lovely phrase, and the reader will often feel they've found a kindred spirit.  Topics include the intimacy of combining libraries, the enjoyment of long words, that odd shelf in your library, the carnal versus the courtly love of books, inscriptions, reading literature about a place while you are there, used books, proofreading, plagiarism, catalogues and reading aloud.  While reading about these delightful subjects you will also learn about the author and her family, Arctic exploration, Thomas Macaulay and a host of other indispensable bits.  The book succeeds on all fronts.<br />It was a pleasure to read a book that made me break out the dictionary, and a dangerous little section at the back recommends yet more books that you probably don't need but that will undoubtedly make your life sweeter, as this one does.  It can be read quickly, but you'd be wiser to savor it.<br />Highest recommendation.	2002-11-20

The six stories included in this compilation are:  The Memoirs of a London Doll by Mrs. Fairstar (1846), The Steadfast Tin Soldier by Hans Christian Anderson (1838), Ruth Ainsworth's Rag Bag, a Baba Yaga tale, Laurence Housman's Rocking Horse Land (1894), and The Town in the Library by E. Nesbit.<br />Each story is preceded by a paragraph of introduction about the author and the story, and the pictures by Angela Barrett are superb.  These tales are a bit lengthy and too intense for young children, but just the thing for the more mature young reader.  This would make a lovely and special gift.	2002-11-20

While I think it is too wordy for little ones, I like that handwashing and flushing are mentioned several times and the picture of the pipes taking the pee and poop away is interesting. Tutter, Ojo and Treelo all use the big toilet, and Pip and Pop induct them into the Toileteers. (A Toileteer sticker is included with the book.) In conclusion, Bear and Luna discuss how growing up doesn't mean you won't be cared for and loved.<br />Not the best book for teaching -- for that use Sears' excellent 'You Can Go to the Potty' -- but a gentle reassuring book for kids who might be a little skeptical about the whole process. Good luck, Toileteer parents!!	2002-11-20

He uses a separate potty seat rather than a toilet insert, and the book uses the terms pee and poop.  There were a couple of things I didn't like about the book -- in one picture Henry is brushing his teeth and has toothpaste squirted all over and a bowl of oatmeal on his head!  This is distracting.  In another picture urine is in a big puddle on the floor when Henry's had an accident.  In yet another, Henry's pants are wet after he had another accident.  I guess I feel I can reassure our toddler if there are accidents; I'd like the book to stay on message and show a positive and successful experience.  Also, as in most other books of this genre, there is little show-or-tell about the actual anatomy or mechanics.  This book isn't terrible and our son likes it, I just don't think it has helped much.	2002-11-20

The happenings in France are at the heart of a mystery which motivates all the subsequent action, as a stranger appears one day who wants to exact revenge against Cassandra's father.  She does not know what happened all those years ago, but she trusts her father, helping him to escape back to France while she stays behind to delay the young Duke of Morland.  The characters are well-written, though Cassandra doubts her feelings long after a reasonable person would; also, a secondary romance develops between two likeable characters, which I enjoyed.<br />Conflict arises first from Cassie wanting the stranger to stay away from her father and later from wanting to reconcile her growing tenderness toward him while staying loyal to her father.  The settings -- France, Hawaii and England -- are interesting and used to good effect.  Horses figure largely here, and that's a good thing too.  And ultimately what you want in a romance, a real desire to see the protagonists united, is here.  Johansen writes in several genres and is talented in all of them.  This romance was enjoyable and I would read others by this author.	2002-11-18

While the artwork is charming, the premise of the story is that sleeping mice are being stored in a jar to be eaten later by a snake.  Like another reviewer, when reading aloud I skip the snake repeatedly describing them as \\"little, warm and tasty\\".  The idea of the mice cleverly escaping and then counting down as they escape is good, but I don't find that the \\"counting up\\" is particularly well done, so that children don't necessarily develop a better understanding of counting or numbers.  To be honest, our toddler likes the book, so I've given it three stars, but IMHO there are much better books for children out there.	2002-11-18

Set in 1985 England, once occupied by the Nazis and now virtually run by the sinister Goliath Corporation, the novel's heroine is Thursday Next -- a special operative in the world of literature, a veteran of the 130-year Crimean War and a confused runaway from true love. Her father is a rogue time traveller, her uncle is a brilliant inventor and her archenemy is Archeron Hades -- a guy who is evil just for the pure joy of being evil and who has begun to kidnap literature's great characters from their original manuscripts, thus changing every copy in existence. Considering the importance of literature in this alternate world, that is not a good thing to do. Thursday must not only contend with this dastardly nemesis, but with bureaucratic headaches, budget shortages, Goliath's Jack Schitt looking over her shoulder, a new partner and the occasional vampyre.<br /><br />If this all sounds a bit confusing, it's an accurate representation of the novel, based on a terrific premise and well written, but sometimes confusing for the sheer number of offbeat names, if nothing else. So many characters are introduced that I would forget who people were and whether they were good or bad, despite the fact that I read the novel in one day (and stayed up til 4 am to do so). My only other complaint is that it is never clear how Hades acquired the unreal skills he uses to perpetrate his crimes; he seems to be a human being but he has abilities that border on the supernatural. There is some violence but it is only occasionally graphic. All that aside, this is quite an accomplishment for a debut novel, and I would recommend it unreservedly to anyone who enjoys literature, time travel, speculation, fun, humour and/or clever writing.<br /><br />Thursday Next is a terrific protagonist and her relatives are a joy. I look forward to the next in the series, though I'd love to see more interaction in a wider number of novels.iterature, time travel, speculation, fun, humour and/or clever writing.

The subjects are most often unknown to the majority of us, but the various authors (including well-known NYT obituary author Robert McG. Thomas, Jr.) humanize each subject and inspire you to contemplate your own life.  Most essays are a couple of pages long, and there is an introduction by Russell Baker.	2002-11-06

Their success comes to an abrupt halt, however, when Bruno Huntley -- an abusive and powerful producer, their latest client and the \\"devil\\" of the title -- dies a gruesome death at the soiree they're catering for him and his closest 600 associates.  When Wesley is considered the number one suspect by the LAPD, Madeline is determined to clear her friend.<br />I read a fair number of mysteries, and this was the first in a long while that didn't leave me dissatisfied.  The wisecracking narrative voice of Madeline Bean was unique and really fun; it was a kick to have the action taking place amid the Hollywood jet set; it was entertaining to have the author talk and tell about food; and the mystery was actually interesting and not transparent.  The operative word here is fun, and even though Jerrilynn Farmer writes in a breezy way, her characters have depth and the plot is interesting.  I'll definitely read more by this author.	2002-10-24

Many are dead, others are traumatized by the war, and still others are embittered by a poor economy and  widening disparity between the haves and have-nots.  Midwife and healer Hannah Trevor lives on the fringe of respectability here, and that's pretty much where she wants to be.  This first in the series paints a bleak but realistic picture of the times and the people, and the reader will learn effortlessly about such things thanks to skillful writing and an intriguing story.  Being the tale of a murder-rape in the aftermath of war, this novel is not for the squeamish; there's a fair bit of brutal violence, sex and situations, though if you can watch cable television you should be okay.  A bit depressing but a worthwhile read and a good mystery.  I will definitely read others in the series, though I'll probably read a comedy or two in between.	2002-10-22

Emerson introduces a great deal of information about the times, the people and the herbs without making it painful, and the book is readable for that alone. The heroine and other characters are believable and three-dimensional and the murder and its solution are reasonably well-done -- better than many historical mysteries. I look forward to reading others in the series.	2002-10-16

I was curious but mildly skeptical after reading the description and reviews here, but find that the puzzles are rewarding.  In addition to challenging examples of the conventional connect-the-dot method, author David Kalvitis introduces creative variations called Sets, Stars, Field of Dots, Odd/Even and No Dots!  Sound intriguing?  That essentially captures the spirit of this tantalizing set of pictures waiting to be liberated from obscurity  by your earnest efforts on their behalf!  It really is fun to see what's hidden there among those dots.  Kalvitis also gives some information about the origins of the form and getting the best results.  If you're at all interested in this puzzle form, and want to exercise your left and right brain simultaneously, you will enjoy this fun book.<br />Note that even the simplest puzzle contains 49 dots and most contain many more, so this is too difficult for little kids but a very nice choice for those who are beginning to outgrow their lower-level puzzles or the child who enjoys/needs practice with fine motor skills or has some interest in art.  Also for puzzle-loving adults.  Nicely done.	2002-10-16

Monfredo introduces a lot of information about women's rights, the area and the lifestyle of the times without awkwardness, and the book is readable for that alone. The heroine and her friends are realistic and likeable, though Glynis is definitely not a confident feminist, and I look forward to reading other books in the series to see if this changes. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the most famous resident of the town, is not a main character but she does show up occasionally and that is fun. The mystery is okay but not dazzling, so all-in-all I'd say this was a promising beginning to this series, and I intend to read more.	2002-10-16

The illustrations are action-filled and colorful, the text is simple, and the book includes tiny flash cards for helping your beginning reader; however, the text is also confusing.  In order to stick to 50 words the author has sacrificed clarity and readability.  It's not always clear who is speaking, and rhymes are often strained and awkward.  Also the lesson is not that slow and steady wins the race, as others have stated, but that Thomas is losing but then finds a shortcut through a tunnel.  All-in-all, not the best of this educational and entertaining series.	2002-10-03

I've read other books by him and enjoyed them very much, and been comforted by them, and was looking forward to this addition to his work. Unfortunately I agree with most of the other comments made here, that the format makes it much more difficult to find specific information.  Because the authors use four composite children to describe many events and behaviors, it makes it difficult to tease out what is relevant. Our toddler is very similar in temperament to &#34;Billy&#34;, but Billy supposedly grew up with an abusive father for a while and his mother has remarried -- nothing like our child's experience -- so what becomes irrelevant in the text and what can we still use?  Largely told as lengthy narratives, it takes a long time to find useful ideas, but there is a good index that helps.<br /><br />Despite the poor format, the ideas here are solid and helpful.  Brazelton and Sparrow posit that as children reach milestones of development they backslide in other areas -- a usually peaceful child suddenly indulging in temper tantrums as they begin to conquer speech, for example.<br /><br />We've found Brazelton's ideas helpful and spot-on, and there are unique events in this age range that make the book useful, though the clunky format keeps it from being invaluable.	2002-09-25
1399383:US	52753467	R1FPTPSQLKM030	0195019199	101936467	A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction (Center for Environmental Structure)	Books	5	159	163	N	N	zen and the art of architecture	I've read all three books in this series, and I thought this was by far the best and most accessible.  The first, &#34;A Timeless Way of Building&#34;, introduced the author's philosophy and was, I thought, a bit bogged down with New Age jargon. I prefer to think in terms of comfort and relationships, though ultimately I agree with just about everything the author-as-designer states and obviously went on to read his other work. I thought the third book, photographs of a project completed by the author, should have been the most informative, but ultimately didn't do justice to the author's ideas. But maybe it was just the poor quality of the pictures. IMHO this is the masterpiece of the trilogy. Its concern is the practical application of the author's ideas, and one could only wish to live or work in a space designed with this philosophy. His thinking is pragmatic AND beautiful, bringing balance and harmony to space.<br /><br />Having made the case for his system of architectural and social design in his earlier work, the author here goes on to formalize a system of 253 patterns, ranging in scale from towns down to benches. Patterns 1 through 94 define a town or community; numbers 95 through 204 define (groups of) buildings; and numbers 205-253 define a &#34;buildable building&#34;. The individual patterns are themselves evocative and inviting, and cover a myriad of human social and environmental relationships: number 1 is Independent Region, pattern 2 is Distribution of Towns, 10 is Magic of the City, 57 is Children in the City, number 62 is High Places, number 63 Dancing in the Street, 94 is Sleeping in Public, 203 Child Caves, 223 Deep Reveals, 235 Soft Inside Walls, 253 Things from Your Life.<br /><br />One example of developing the pattern language for a specific project using a subset of the author's Pattern Language is that of the front porch, composed of 10 elements: private terrace on street, sunny place, six-foot balcony, outdoor room, paths & goals, ceiling height variety, columns at the corners, front-door bench, raised flowers and different chairs. Alexander gives many such examples and eloquently details the process of exploring patterns and moving between them in a search for the proper set. And that is one thing that makes this book special and fun. He does not say a 'successful' set of elements but a 'proper' set of elements. At first that might  seem like a lot of hot hubris, but on reading you find that there is a reason that a balcony should be 6-feet square .... THAT is the minimum space required for people to have a comfortable discussion around a small table.  It is a charming and useful way to look at one's surroundings, and each of the 253 patterns is given the treatment as the author goes on to detail each element's specifications, definition and purpose.<br /><br />These expanded definitions are often quite charming; for instance, under pattern 57, Children in the City, he specifies a very safe bike path that meanders past workplaces and shops with windows so that kids can see the diversity and alive-ness of the place in which they live.  Lovely idea.<br /><br />While others have noted that Alexander's ideas inspired changes in software engineering, I would also like to note that the author's ideas were, in turn, most likely informed by others, such as neuroscientist Karl Lashley and, in particular, linguist Noam Chomsky. Chomsky developed the idea of a generative grammar, composed of constituent symbols, a set of rules and a set of terminal elements, which together describe all possible sentences in a language. This was considered revolutionary at the time and is quite similar to Alexander's characterization of his patterns, described as a context combined with a system of forces or rules generating an infinite number of  solutions in the form of sets of specific design elements. That configuration, in turn, becomes the context for another pattern. The theory's dynamism and scalability render it verypowerful indeed.<br /><br />I think another interesting approach to this philosophy would be to reverse engineer our own environment. To say, Obviously there is a Pattern Language at work in the larger world in which we live, and it is decidedly in opposition to what Mr. Alexander and others, including myself, believe is preferred.  What are the rules of that language? What is the context within which those elements operate?  The author codifies a desirable Pattern Language. I'd like to see his principles used to turn an eye toward decodifying our own milieu. This is the kind of book that leads one to think and imagine, and isn't that a wonderful thing?<br /><br />What I didn't like about this book were that neither ideas nor photographs were credited, which is frustrating for someone who wants to follow up on these ideas, and not fair to those whose work contributed to the author's. The author apologized for this in his first book, but then repeated the discourtesy here; the second time is less forgivable. Also, there is no index, which is especially painful for a librarian :-)  I would have liked to have seen a more diverse selection of examples, and some attempt to address the  implementation of  a pattern language after more conventional designs are already in place. That said, I agree with the many others who have stated that this book changed the way they looked at their surroundings, and I'm profoundly grateful to the author for his work, which stands up well after a quarter century.<br /><br />Even when mediocrity (or worse) is the order of the day, there are those voices in the wilderness who speak to a better understanding and envision a better world. In codifying an aesthetic relationship among elements of a viable, living environment and describing a system of scalable self-sustaining systems, the author joins visionaries like R. Buckminster Fuller, who bring a philosophy to architecture that is as much about living as it is about building. I would encourage anyone who is interested in architecture, design, a philosophy of organic wholeness, or creating a more humane environment, to read this informative and provocative book.resting approach to this philosophy would be to reverse engineer our own environment.

This is a standard plot but well-written enough to be entertaining and a fun read.  Circumstances result in silly behavior from an otherwise intelligent heroine and we come to appreciate that the Duke's legendary reputation as a rake does not fully encompass the man.  The characters have strengths as well as flaws, and the book is very good until about the last 30 pages.  The main impediment to the two protagonists' recognizing and formalizing their love for each other is Jane's flight from accusations of attempted murder and theft, yet after this issue is resolved the two characters continue through a series of trivial obstacles for another couple of dozen pages.  It was too anticlimactic.  There are two scenes of physical passion; one is rather explicit but not graphic.  I enjoyed this book and would read others by the same author.	2002-09-17

The book begins with an undetailed map of the Boston vicinity, continues with a paragraph of introduction, and then moves on to the alphabet. Each letter gets a full page and has an alliterative title with a few explanatory sentences and some related factoids. For example, \\"M\\" is entitled \\"Minutemen made ready at a moment's notice\\"; text describes the events in Lexington and Concord on April 18, 1775; watercolor pictures show the Minuteman statue in Lexington and the Old North Bridge in Concord; factoids tell us that British soldiers were called \\"regulars\\" and that the midnight riders (Paul Revere, William Dawes and Samuel Prescott) called out \\"The regulars are out! The regulars are out!\\" as they rode through the night. End pages depict an alphabet of objects other than those seen in the book, such as Magnolia for \\"M\\".<br />With nice art and layout, this book imparts quite a few interesting facts about Boston, though one thinks it might have benefitted from an overarching coherence with which to motivate the more sophisticated young readers at which it is purportedly aimed.	2002-09-17

I'd say this is more a book for parents than kids, more for Seinfeld fans than others, but enjoyable for all.  James Bennett's illustrations are Pixar-ish and fall-down funny, filled with comic elements, sly digs and caricaturish facial expressions that perfectly capture one's imagined little Jerry.<br />On an attached cd, the author reads/performs the book in front of a live audience.

Irascible Auntie's only social visitors are her four nephews, who visit once a year during the holidays to ensure they'll still be recognized in the annual rewriting of her will.  This year, however, is different.  On the eve of the lawyer's coming Hettie is found murdered, and last year's will must stand -- naming Jessica the sole heir, but only if she marries one of the nephews.

Nor is it great literature.  It is a Regency Romance, and as such it will provide a few hours' entertainment without taxing your brain.  There are lots of typos, which makes you wonder how much even the author and editor care, but the heroine is sympathetic and the mystery is not transparent.	2002-09-03

He criticizes attitudes, procedures and policies that were put in place in order to supply unimaginative and obedient drones to industry, and tells parents that if they're able they should homeschool, but if they're unable they should work hard to counteract the destructive effects of a school system that crushes imagination, original thinking and the love of learning.<br /><br />Schank, a pioneer in cognitive psychology and computer learning, introduces the concepts of dynamic memory, case-based reasoning and scripts, and plays up the importance of computer simulations, role play and field trips. He draws heavily -- almost narcissistically -- on examples from his own children and parenting experiences, sometimes detracting from their utility or universality.  For instance, he says parents and teenagers should take walks and long bus rides so they can converse. Huh? The author relates the story of how he and his teenage daughter, given the time and isolation of these activities, achieved better communication. What about a car trip? Plane?  Blimp? Camping? He thinks kids should run for office, participate in sports and go to summer camp, whether or not they want to. Sometimes he makes the case, but again his examples and reasoning are so self-centered that one wonders how generalizable they are.<br /><br />The author posits that most students do not need to be taught math or literature, but do need history and science that is limited to nutrition, health and reproduction. Here the author does a fine job of forcing you to re-evaluate your assumptions about education, but I didn't always agree with his conclusions. He defines the six traits of smarter kids as verbal proficiency, creativity, analytical ability, gumption, ambition and inquisitiveness, and devotes a chapter to each.  He advises parents to expect an &#34;A&#34; only in a student's favorite subject and passing grades in all others, defending their children from teachers who are out to squash their spirit. He dislikes television, encourages literacy as soon as possible, defines learning as expectation failure, and believes experimentation is self-regulating.<br /><br />As you can see, the author is opinionated and a bit eccentric, though I have to say I agree with many of his criticisms and more than a few of his solutions. I do take umbrage at his peevish dismissal of Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences as being too politically correct, making everyone &#34;smart at something&#34; -- as if it's any more bizarre than 'Take Your Teen on a Greyhound Bus' day.<br /><br />Special chapters are included on the benefits of sports; computer-based learning, including how to evaluate software; and the relative benefits and perils of public schools, private schools and homeschooling as well as the difference between research-oriented universities and smaller liberal arts colleges.

Despite the loss of this treasure trove, Stephanie Barron manages to capture the style and spirit of Miss Jane's lovely prose, and she does so within the framework of cozy murder mysteries. The series is highly entertaining, and this fourth installment is no exception. Though the mystery is fairly transparent  (It's easy to figure out what happened, though it takes a while to figure out whodunit), the language is elegant and witty and we learn a lot about Britain's Great Terror, landscaping, horses and even Jane Austen and her family.<br /><br />My next visit to England will definitely include a visit to Godmersham! Though I would appreciate an author's note detailing the fictional status of the characters, I am puzzled by the complaints about learning. When knowledge is gained so painlessly, why would one choose mindless entertainment?<br /><br />This story takes place near Jane's brother Edward's estate, Godmersham, in Kent, at the time if the Canterbury Races. At first I was disappointed that some of the series' most endearing characters were missing -- Eliza and Sir Harold Trowbridge are only mentioned or appear briefly. I was not as disappointed to have Jane's mother and sister absent, as Cassandra is basically a wet blanket in this series and Mother is very annoying. But I was pleasantly surprised to become better acquainted not only with Jane's brothers Neddie and Henry, but also Neddie's wife Lizzy and daughter Fanny. These characters are a lot of fun, and scenes of the family gathering to try and reason out matters are particularly engaging. I agree with the reviewer who said that Julian Sothey's devotion to Anne Sharpe did not seem justified, but otherwise thought that the characters here were quite engaging and beautifully drawn.<br /><br />In addition to being historically accurate, Ms. Barron takes pains to incorporate real events from Jane Austen's experience into the story, and if you also have a copy of Jane Austen's Letters, you will be delighted to read those from the same time period and find the correspondence (so to speak) between events real and fictional.<br /><br />One trusts Miss Jane would approve.ition to being historically accurate, Ms. Barron takes pains to incorporate real events from Jane Austen's experience into the story, and if you also have a copy of Jane Austen's Letters, you will be delighted to read those from the same time period and find the correspondence (so to speak) between events real and fictional.

This is the second book I've read by Phillip Margolin, and I found the same strengths and weaknesses in both.  Margolin is a fine writer, and his pacing and characterizations are first-rate.  In both this novel and \\"Gone, But Not Forgotten\\" he begins with a confusing melee of scenarios and people which only gradually cohere, but this gives the reader an immediate sense of vertiginous excitement.  What is less forgivable is the lack of any real depth to otherwise vibrant characters.  We get plenty of history but never any motive or exploration of people's thinking.  Granted, this is not a psychological thriller, but no one ever even wonders why any of these people do what they do, let alone try to explain it.  There is some hint of the seductive thrall of evil and a sentence or two about wanting to make sure no innocent man is convicted, but they fall short.<br />Advertising for this book is sloppy, emphasizing the protagonist David Nash's 'Ice Man' reputation, even though that aspect of his persona is never referred to after the introductory pages.  Advertising also attests to Nash's unswerving belief in his new client's innocence, but that isn't really the case in the book.  The marketers didn't even read the book.<br />I would read a Margolin novel any day.  They are exciting and fun -- excellent page-turning thrillers.  But I am waiting for something more, and I hope he has it in him.	2002-08-28

Johansen is a gifted writer who brings depth and passion to her characters at the same time she weaves a rich and compelling story.  I really enjoyed this, and literally stayed up all night to finish it.<br />Sarah and her golden retriever Monty form a well-respected rescue team, so the action moves all around the globe, and apparently characters from previous books are here as well.  At first I felt a bit lost because it was obvious that these characters had a history but, even though I hadn't read those other novels, Johansen did a superb job of revealing their history as the story unfolded.  By the end I was really interested in these people and anxious to know what the outcome of the book would be.  The romance was believable and passionate.  This was truly an entertaining book written for intelligent adults.  Great summer read!	2002-08-11

Each chapter begins with the person's nickname, dates of birth and death, a quote and a picture.  Vital statistics are presented -- the age and cause of death, survivors left behind and other close brushes with death.  A multi-page synopsis of the person's life is given, followed by a lengthy description of the funeral preparation and service, including what objects the person was buried with, and the headlines of the day.  Printed on heavy paper, the design is very nice and the photographs are plentiful and of high quality.  The people discussed are: Josephine Baker, Sarah Bernhardt, Winston Churchill, Salvador Dali, Thomas Edison, Mahatma Gandhi, Jim Henson, Grace Kelly, JFK, Ayatollah Khomeini, Martin Luther King, Jr., Marilyn Monroe, Notorious B.I.G., Eva Peron, Edith Piaf, Pope John Paul XXIII, Elvis Presley, FDR, Babe Ruth, Diana Spencer, Joseph Stalin, Igor Stravinsky, Rudolph Valentino and Mao Zedong.  This is a great book to leave out for browsing, filled with great photos and interesting facts.  I was very happy when I received it.  Very nicely done.	2002-08-11

While other reviewers consistently liken this novel to Eco's The Name of the Rose or Pears' Instance of the Fingerpost -- two of my favorite novels -- I found this literary journey was much less satisfying.  King is a good writer in some ways.  His descriptions of characters fills them out quickly and renders them interesting, and this was an interesting historical period.  But King often resorts to interminable lists of objects and books as his narrator describes his surroundings or carries on internal monologues about rare books he's heard of.  It's obvious that King has done his homework, but then he seems to willing to tell us every little thing he's learned rather than letting the demands of the story determine what's included.  Other problems: divided into two storylines separated by several decades, the secondary plot was more interesting and dynamic; a cypher discovered early in the work is decoded but never adequately explained; and, most disturbing, the ending is decidedly loopy.  I thought the premise was great and some aspects of the story were very good, but ultimately I was just anxious to get through the book and disappointed at the outlandish ending.  Obviously some people really liked this book, so it might be a good idea to read some of the sample pages.	2002-08-11

I thought the story was immediately interesting. The author introduced a lot of characters quickly but usually did so in a nonconfusing way while still writing the kind of details that make a fictional character come to life.  I felt I knew a lot about them within a few paragraphs.  Everything was written in the third person, and the action jumped around a lot; that made things move fast and it was interesting to read the experiences of several lawyers and detectives, a killer, a private detective etc.  Characters were complex but in general I liked the good peple and didn't like the bad ones, and I like that.  The story also moved around in time and this was done well.<br /><br />In the book, we learn that a serial killer had murdered in New York state ten years prior.  The killer always left a black rose and a note -- &#34;Gone, But Not Forgotten&#34;.  (One disappointing aspect to the book is that this idiosyncracy is never explained.)  A decade later, the same M.O. is being used in a series of crimes in Portland, Oregon.  This story is about how the people in Portland are looking for the killer and how people from the earlier investigation become involved.<br /><br />This was an intelligent read and enjoyable. I will definitely read other books by this author.	2002-08-10

Maria's house is a wondrous place.  The ocean is inside, as are the Arctic and a passage to Egypt.  These are the kind of stories that fire kids' imaginations, and the drawings are spectacular -- reminiscent of Gustav Dore's wonderful line drawings.

All the tugs are excited about the arrival of the Tall Ships to the Big Harbor, and it's Theodore's job to say hello to each arrival in their own language.

I don't like the story but the paper art is terrific.<br />This is the story of Ollie the elephant, who is unhappy on his birthday despite having had a party with lots of presents.  Right away Ollie strikes me as a little ingrate.  He's unhappy because he got skates but what he really wants is a baby brother.  When his mom tells him this is an unreasonable request, Ollie leaves.  He meets a variety of animals and asks each to give him a sibling or accept him into their family -- a stork, a deer, a frog, a cat,  a badger family, a mother and child kangaroo, a peacock, a bat and a woodpecker.  Ollie's goals shift fluidly -- he wants a baby brother, he wants to find his mother, he wants to find his roller skates -- and confusedly.  We never see the skates lost, for instance, don't know where they are, and then just as suddenly Ollie has found them again.  I know that doesn't sound like much, but the story is vaguely incoherent; likewise, interactions with the other animals are disjointed and inconsistent.  Ollie is gone for multiple days (!) and at one point he calls his mother but she never comes.  Kind of a bleak message for a little kid's story.  When he is just about to find his mother, Ollie gets so excited that he crashes into a tree and wakes up in a hospital with a broken leg!  When he's recovered a bit his mom tells him he is indeed going to have a baby brother or sister.  Ollie limps back to bed and dreams of being an older sibling.  So that's the resolution?  This is one goofy book.<br />On the other hand, the artwork is very fine and there are some unique and interesting paper engineering feats.  I guess I would never buy this book for its own sake.  There must be a lot of books that deal with the issue of siblings better than this.  But it's a clever and pleasing pop-up.	2002-07-30

The style is minimalist and the activities are dated, but the story is also simple and active -- and very interesting to toddlers and young children.

At first he doesn't like being responsible for the little cetacean, but soon finds himself upset when its pod is found and the youngster's going to leave.<br />This is a gentle lesson with a beloved cast of characters, though I'd say it's the weakest of the three Theodore books we have read.  If you already have other books in the series, this is a fine addition; if you are choosing an introduction to the characters, Theodore's Whistle is a better book.	2002-07-23

This is one of the better companion books to this popular kids television show, and complements the Blue's Big Musical movie.  Pictures are drawn in a coloring book format and many stickers are included, as well as cut-out characters and a cut-out stage.  There is a lot to do here, with some help needed for cutting, and the story of Steve and Blue and all the usual characters getting their show ready is not only entertaining and instructive for kids, but is a great setup for children's continuing play using their own ideas for the actual (or their own) show.

Rowling's statement that it was her favorite book as a child, and it's easy to see why she loved it.  I wish I had known of it when I was a child.  An allegory, a fairy tale and a morality play all rolled into one, this delightful story should entertain adult readers and enchant the younger set, though it may be too very sweet for older kids.<br />As Goudge's The Little White Horse opens, Maria Merryweather is travelling toward her destiny, though she does not yet know this.  Suddenly an impoverished orphan, she is travelling to Moonacre Manor, the home of a mysterious relative, in the company of her caretaker Miss Heliotrope and her little dog Wiggins.  The story of Maria's adventures is fanciful and charming and populated by magical characters living in an enchanted place.  Maria learns that people and stories are usually more than first impressions suggest, that even virtuous people have faults and even wicked people have goodness, that one can learn from previous mistakes ?- one?s own and others? ?- and make a better decision next time.  All problems are resolved at the end, all loose ends tied neatly. First published in 1946, the voice here hints at modern narrative awareness of itself, but Is never cynical.<br />A drawing of Moonacre Manor is here, and chapters are short enough to make this a great read-aloud novel.	2002-07-21

In college I started to read James Michener's books, and was surprised to find that our history was actually pretty interesting. Now I consider myself fortunate to have discovered the works of Kenneth Roberts -- a magnificent writer who brings the Revolution to life and makes me angry at a school system that couldn't spark my interest. Why is it that a novelist can teach me more in one book than what I gleaned from years of tedious instruction? Rant aside, let me say that Roberts' work is as compelling as Michener's but differs in scope. The latter's books sweep across aeons and generations, plucking and delving into personal stories, while Roberts stays within a brief span of years but sweeps broadly, at the same time telling the story believably through one person's experience.<br /><br />Roberts is a gifted writer relating an account of the Patriots' Northern army through the first-person narration of  Peter Merrill, a sea captain from Arundel, Maine, who has joined the army with his brother and finds himself a scout under the command of the brilliant and volatile, pre-treasonous General Benedict Arnold. The narrative of this sequel to Roberts' novel ARUNDEL is immediately interesting. At first I was disappointed that the narrator was not the same as that in the previous book, Steven Nason, but I came to enjoy Merrill's voice as well, and was very happy that characters from the previous novel were also here -- Nason, Cap Huff, Phoebe, Natanis and of course Marie de Sabrevois (aka Mary) -- as well as interesting new characters like Doc Means and Verrieul.<br /><br />I disagree with other reviewers in some respects. Against all past experience and inclination, I find I actually enjoy the outspoken buffoon Cap Huff who, in his way, captures a rough-and-ready spirit and is resilient in any situation.  I also think that Marie is an intriguing character but that her distance from the narrative recreates the mystery and consternation that these characters would feel about her.<br /><br />This book makes you realize that Congress hasn't changed much in over 200 years.  A map helps you place the action, and if you are on the fence about whether or not to read this or any other Kenneth Roberts book, please take the plunge.  You won't be sorry.<br /><br />Highly recommended.tance from the narrative recreates the mystery and consternation that these characters would feel about her.

The mystery was not intriguing enough. The writing was inelegant. Worst of all, the ending was disappointing -- so many things were hinted at in the novel, so many suggestions that this was going to be one of those satisfying books where the author somehow ties all the loose ends into an unexpected but plausible denouement -- the kind of book you want to start reading again right away to see where the real clues were hidden. Instead, the ending was anticlimactic and none of the innuendos were addressed. (Spoiler Warning) Instead, the protagonist feels betrayed by someone and perpetrates an uninspired revenge, while the novel itself ends with a tired literary device.<br /><br />Being a librarian I enjoyed the arcana, but thought most of the characters were two-dimensional and unsympathetic. The author contrives intriguing plot devices and writes decent dialogue, but neither devices nor dialogue reveal much beyond plot advancement. Type is big and white space is plentiful. A fast but clunky novel that does not meet the expectations it raises in the first three-quarters of the book. I probably won't buy the author's first book, but if someone gave me a copy I'd read it.<br /><br />I wanted to like this book, I just didn't. Since reviews are mixed, perhaps you should read some sample pages to decide for yourself. Unfortunately, sample pages can't save you from the sense of ultimate disappointment some readers have felt at the dispirited ending.	2002-07-15

Five hundred artists, from Agasse to Zurbaran, are represented. To each painter or sculptor one page is devoted, featuring a full-color print (covering about two-thirds of the page); a paragraph of text that discusses the artist's work in general, the specific work depicted, and cross-references to similar artists; information about the artist and the piece including the artist's place and year of birth and death, the work's title, date, medium/materials, physical dimensions and current location.<br />Presented alphabetically rather than chronologically, this dynamic little tome makes great browsing, and helps you to look at art in a way we don't usually -- outside of its historical context. The color plates and paper are of the first quality, and the text is delightful -- as if you had a very smart and articulate mentor who could describe an artist or a movement in a way that actually makes sense. I've read several books on artistic aesthetics, hoping to find a better appreciation for the art that I mainly enjoy viscerally and IMHO, these pithy remarks do as well or better than those whole books.  <br />It's fun to see which work was chosen as typical of your favorite artists, and it's fun to try and guess the period in which an artist worked before you read the information.  Just the kind of book to leave out when guests are over, and the price is so reasonable and the size so manageable that this is an art book I can leave out for kids to enjoy too.<br />Because so much is fit into such a small volume, some readers may be frustrated at the small print, though the font is quite clean. The book closes with glossaries of technical terms and artistic movements, and a directory of museums and galleries, organized by country, that includes address, phone number and a list of the book's works that they own.

The description says there are ten designs, but they are selling themselves short.  Many of the designs contain multiple images, and a couple of them contain quite a few.  There are almost 50 stars of various sizes and styles; one large group of stars is set up as a border.  Two suns (one elaborate and about 6 inches square, the other simpler and about 3 inches square), two crescent moons (one plain, one smiling), and three planets (and a couple of small full moons) complete this very nice set.	2002-06-28

The paper is nice, the colorwork is great.  And it is a sweet way to introduce (or reinforce) the beauty and diversity of the alphabet.  The endpages show an upper- and lowercase alphabet and each letter pair is associated with a word.  Aa with Artist, Bb with Bumblebee, etc.  Once inside, you'll find facing 8-inch square pages for each letter -- on one side beautiful large letters (\\"U is for umbrella\\") and on the other a full-page color plate of a detail from one of the Museum's artworks (an umbrella from Degas's 'Waiting').  Small print on the text page gives you the artist's name, nationality and lifespan, and the work's title and date.  The book ends with small representations of the entire works from which details were taken.  The three features -- letter pairs with word, word with painting detail, and letter with full picture -- complement each other in a way that also makes this a book ripe for play.  This is the kind of resource I would like to see more of from this country's artistic community -- educational, thoughtful and fun.  Thanks, Getty!	2002-06-28

Five hundred artists, from Agasse to Zurbaran, are represented.  Each painter or sculptor gets one page that features a full-color print (covering about two-thirds of the page); a paragraph of text that discusses the artist's work in general, the specific work depicted, and cross-references to similar artists; information about the artist and the piece, including the artist's place and year of birth and death, the work's title, date, medium/materials, physical dimensions and current location.<br /><br />Presented alphabetically, rather than chronologically, this dynamic little tome makes great browsing, and helps you to look at art in a way we don't usually -- outside of its historical context.  The paper and color plates are of the first quality and the text is informative.  It's fun to see which work was chosen as typical of your favorite artists, and it's fun to try and guess the period in which an artist worked before you read the information.<br /><br />Because so much is fit into such a small volume, some readers may be frustrated at the small print, though the font is quite clean.  The book closes with glossaries of technical terms and artistic movements and a directory of museums and galleries, organized by country, that includes address, phone number and a list of the book's works that they own.

1501915:US	52753467	R1POZG3RWZNZRK	0553578170	833483533	Jane and the Wandering Eye: Being the Third Jane Austen Mystery	Books	4	11	11	N	Y	an enjoyable addition to the series	I enjoy these Jane Austen-as-sleuth novels. Author Stephanie Barron is a fine writer who emulates Austen's elegant prose style with success. This third installment of the series takes place in 1804 Bath, where Jane's family has moved, in part to accommodate father George's declining health, and Jane dislikes intensely living in a place of such &#34;dissipation&#34;. A murder has occurred during a fancy dress party Jane attends, and she is drawn into the mystery by her old friend, Lord Harold Trowbridge.<br /><br />I had some minor quibbles with the book -- Austen's renowned wit is missing, too many characters (in costumes, no less!) and relationships make the plot confusing -- but in general I enjoyed this book very much, and appreciate the opportunity to spend time with our beloved Jane as the author deftly weaves historical and biographical facts into her story.<br /><br />Personally I enjoy the footnotes, which are infrequent, informative and not at all intrusive.	2002-06-21
1501972:US	52753467	RIFH8OO5A371G	0553574892	74232266	Jane and the Man of the Cloth: Being the Second Jane Austen Mystery (Being A Jane Austen Mystery)	Books	3	2	4	N	Y	fun novel in the author's series of Jane Austen as sleuth	I've read the first three books in this series and believe this, the second, is the weakest of the three, though Barron is a fine writer and the setting is interesting.  1804 Lyme, where Jane and her family have come to spend their holiday by the sea, is a hotbed of activity for smugglers as Britain battles intermittently with Napoleonic France, and two murders incite Jane to action.  While Austen's wit is not here, Barron does capture the style and elegance of Regency England and we do get to see more of Jane's charming sister-in-law Eliza.  What I think weakened this particular story is Jane's level of activity.  She is sneaking out at night, following criminals to hidden caves, hitting scoundrels on the head -- it really is a bit preposterous -- more like a Nancy Drew novel.  Still, Barron deftly incorporates biographical information as well as historical fact into her narrative, making the read even more enjoyable.<br />If you enjoy Jane Austen or Regency England, there is a good chance you will appreciate these books, though this is not the best of the series.	2002-06-21

Each spread features a full-page photograph of a big construction vehicle at work with text on the facing page.  The wording is exciting, e.g. &quot;Climb up in the cab and start your engine!&quot;  and interspersed throughout are symbols that correspond to pads at the right margin of the book.  When your child presses the appropriate button, the story comes alive with the sound of a truck starting up, a horn, a digger scooping dirt, a backing-up beep or a jackhammer.  The sounds are realistic and pretty clear.  Your small truck devotee should really enjoy this exciting book.	2002-06-15

Yes, it grates a bit on the adult sensibility to have Albert standing in the window for several weeks, but the author and illustrator collaborate nicely in this exploration of more complex emotions -- the tale of a youthful man's anxiety about the bad things in life and how his finding commitment to something outside himself lends him greater perspective.<br />Illustrations are lovely, and the content is appropriate for older kids exploring more complex emotions.	2002-06-15

For example, the chapter known as &#34;Four&#34; includes the following: What are the four voyages of Lemuel Gulliver? What are the four conic sections? What are the four sections of a symphony orchestra? etc.<br /><br />Chapters are: Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven, Twelve, Thirteen, Fourteen, Fifteen, Eighteen, Twenty and Twenty-Four. What makes the book more than just a quiz generator is the lengthy explanatory text, anywhere from three to eighteen pages. These pithy essays entertain and inform, and add greatly to the volume's enjoyment. Some questions are really obscure -- what were the five rivers of the classical underworld, anyway?  -- but even the easier ones can leave you scratching your head and cursing your memory. Didn't I used to know all this stuff? Then, after you knock yourself on the head and shout &#34;Of course!&#34;, you will have the pleasure of reading  a well-written essay by a co-author or one of a small number of contributors.<br /><br />There is also a fourteen page suggested reading list, organized by subject, that includes music and URLs.  Rounded out with a good index, this is very nicely done and lots of fun.	2002-06-03

While the author does a good job of portraying three-dimensional characters, I have three problems with this book:  there is little action, the writing is poor, and the characters are not very sympathetic. As to the first criticism -- the first passionate kiss occurs on page 207!  Also, the majority of sex scenes involve rape or extortion.  Lovely.  If that's what I want, I can watch NYPD Blue.<br /><br />Secondly, plain old BAD WRITING. I could tell I was in trouble on the first page and it only got worse. At least eight times we are told that Draco has &#34;a dark mat of hair upon his chest&#34;. Get a thesaurus!  At one point the heroine is the victim of &#34;waves of lethargy&#34;. Huh? An orgasm is, of course, &#34;a roaring tide of exhiliration&#34; and one can be overcome by &#34;the depths of its deluge&#34;.<br /><br />Every time anything important happens to Maggie (the narrator and heroine) she sees a red mist or she is floating &#34;in a nightmare from which she cannot awaken&#34;. Ouch. This florid phrasing is used over and over.  And this author never met a comma she didn't like. Here is an actual example (and there were plenty of others from which to choose): &#34; In response, Iverleigh, deeply affronted, jerked open the door, intending, I had no doubt, to deliver a sharp rebuke&#34;. Please, cut out, the, commas.<br /><br />Midway through the book, the author decides to devote two straight pages to a short history lesson -- listing a series of inventions and political developments that are never referred to again. The author blurb states that Ms. Brandewyne has won many awards. I find this unbelievable, but I refuse to buy another of her books to see if there's an improvement.<br /><br />Finally, the characters. While some of the people who populate this book are complex and interesting, not all are, and unfortunately that includes the two main protagonists. Maggie occasionally tells us how intelligent she is, but you'd never know it. She is constantly deceived or caught by surprise, and doesn't understand events or motives even when others do. Several times Maggie says she is &#34;dimly conscious&#34; of one thing or another. Hear, hear.  I'll go for that. She has low self-esteem and constantly tells herself she is a victim -- and deserves it -- even when she is drugged and raped. The hero, Draco, is non-communicative and violent, but somehow still desirable. Maggie's &#34;treasonous young body&#34; can't resist him. Several times she says that at least she knows he won't abandon her or abuse her. How does she know that? Based on everything she thinks about him, that is exactly what he would do.<br /><br />Maggie is repulsed by Draco yet somehow also fascinated by him. That's how I felt about this book. This is the kind of purple prosed romance that inspired me to stop reading them years ago.  I'll take Bertrice Small or any number of other talented writers over this. I am not trying to insult other people's tastes. This is nothing more nor less than my opinion, but I think there are better and more entertaining novels out there.

The author first introduces color theory -- basic (attributes, temperature, mixing) and advanced (color interaction, hierarchy, proportion, harmony) -- and then moves on to schemes (monotonic, monochromatic, analogous, complementary, discordant).  The second (and lengthier) part of the book contains 36 color photographs illustrating the various schemes, each accompanied by more than a few alternative color chip palettes.<br />I learned a lot and enjoyed doing so.

The author of this gossipy, quick read reveals many of history's naughty bits with a smart-alecky attitude.  It is titillating without being overly detailed and features short chapters, usually 4 to 10 pages, organized into nine categories: sex, vice, marriage, bad parenting, family feuds, madness, Roman emperors, popes and death.  Supplemental material is generous and includes family trees, a timeline, a bibliography and chronological lists of the British, French and Russian monarchies; the latter also contain the index, which detracts a bit from its usefulness -- you have to know a figure's nationality and place in time to look them up.

I've had the book for a year and got good results this year using plants I chose, based on this author's advice, last year.<br /><br />The book starts with a short chapter on the basics: soil, hardiness zones, mulching, planting, watering and pests -- one paragraph each.  Each of fifty plants then gets one-and-a-half pages (and the print is big) -- a photo, a paragraph of introduction to the plant followed by how and where to grow instructions, a mention of varieties, and a chart that gives zone hardiness, bloom time, light, height and interest.  Also of value are sidebars on a wide variety of topics, e.g. planting under trees, winter protection, wildflowers from seeds, propagating by division, woodland planting, coordinating strong color, controlling slugs.  These sidebars are made more valuable by their inclusion in the index.  There is also a glossary and a hardiness zone map.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable and informative book, but if you are a neophyte you might also want to get a companion book that covers basics more thoroughly, and if you are a truly devoted gardener you might want to get a book that devotes more time to each species and/or discusses more plants.	2002-05-03

It seems that every topic under the sun is covered, from choosing and caring for a wide variety of plants to displaying them in all manner of rooms.  Plant care instructions for each species are only about a third of a page but there is a lot of information packed into that space -- a photo, description and temperature, light, water, humidity, repotting and propagation facts.

It begins with how to assess your space and plan your garden, then moves on to soil, climate and tools.  The techniques section is great -- teaching you how to propagate, hoe, mulch, prune, etc.  There is also an excellent chapter on troubles, including but not limited to, pests and weed control, and special chapters on greenhouse ad water gardening.  This is a fantastic book.  The flaw?  NO INDEX.  It is a pain to find information about specific plants because it is difficult to find.  Plants are divided into climbers, shrubs, conifers, trees, roses, fruits, annuals, bulbs, perennials and vegetables, but often you have to look through several sections to find the plant you're interested in, and if it's not in the book, it takes you a long time to find that out.

I don't always know how to do a thing and just as often don't know when to do it either!  The author takes us through a full year's worth of work, beginning with using a garden diagram and proceeding through finding plants and tools, pruning, weeding, mulching, watering and fertilizing, pest control, maintenance and getting ready for the next season.  The book concludes with a chart of instructions for particular species of perennials, an index and a bibliography.  The chart, in fitting with the emphasis of the book, instructs in each plant's proper care and is divided into months, April through November.  The first chapter, kind of an overview of the year-in-gardening approach, has many color photographs, and the rest of the book contains many line drawings to illustrate techniques.

I was thrilled by the time I got to part two, which begins and ends on the same timeline as 'Emma' -- for instance, do you remember when Jane accompanies her aunt, Miss Bates, to Hartfield in order to thank Emma and her father for the quarter-section of pork, and they bring the news that Mr. Elton has become engaged to someone in Bath?  Well, here you are in the room when Jane and her aunt first get the news as they are leaving for Hartfield -- it is delicious!  There are many such overlaps, and all are delightful.  There are also lots of commas and semi-colons and other such idiosyncracies found in the works of Austen and her contemporaries, and the style rings true.  I would say it comes very close to being an Austen novel, and is one of the best of the Austen homages, but the humor of Austen is not here.  Also, the novel is so well-done that I would have enjoyed an account of events after the original timeline.  One does want to know that Jane is happy and Frank is true and Emma's friendship continues....  Still, a very satisfying read, and I will definitely read more works by this author.	2002-04-28

When you were a kid, didn't you think there was something wrong with a lot of fairy tales?  What right did Jack have to take the giant's possessions?  If the way was so perilous, why did Little Red Riding Hood's mother send her to grandma's house alone?  And why do stepmothers and wolves get such a bad rap?  Well, the truth as they say, will out.  And A. Wolf has decided to tell what *really* happened between him and the three little pigs.  It was all a misunderstanding, and you can read all about it in that flagship newspaper The Daily Wolf.<br />Author Jon Scieszka has written a funny version of the famous tale that will entertain as it helps kids see another point of view and evaluate differing tales.	2002-04-13

Both tales are illustrated with line drawings and each is well told, combining the best principles of language building, such as a better-than-average vocabulary and a mix of sentence lengths, without sacrificing an evocative and plausible narrative flow.  The revisionist story is told by the stepmother, who contends that Snow White has resented her since her arriva; Snow White has convinced other people that her stepmother is trying to kill her.<br />These books are a wonderful mechanism for children who are just beginning to understand that other minds have other thoughts.  The stories are well-told -- entertaining and instructive.  Why lecture to your kids about morality when with a story they can begin to figure it out for themselves?	2002-04-13

With text by Robert Campbell and photographs (primarily) by Peter Vanderwarker, this book is not only a wonderful volume documenting the history of Boston, but a general and gentle instruction in the rise and fall and rise and fall cycles of many cities, focusing in particular on the &quot;built environment&quot;. All photographs are in black-and-white, but this makes the comparison between old and new cityscapes easier.  Within each of seven chapters there are a series of two-page pieces featuring photographs and an essay on such topics as: Murdering Another Street, A Waterfront Workplace Becomes a Playpen, A Landmark on Top of a Landmark, A Building That Floats, etc.  The text is informative and interesting.  Maps are used to supplement the material, and a good index follows.  If only all history and architecture books could be this well done!<br />Exceptional work, highly recommended.	2002-04-09

The book has MANY photographs and drawings to illustrate technique and finished objects and, after several introductory chapters that focus on the use of stencils and paint effects, is organized into a series of projects.  Within the context of these seven specific projects the author describes various techniques, such as using a multi-overlay stencil, shading, stippling, creating woodgrain, pitfalls to avoid, freeform stencilling, etc.  Each project is accompanied by a pattern that can be enlarged on a photocopier and then used to make the stencils you'll need to complete the project.  The projects described are a rose border, teddy bear, keys, grapevine, shelf with crockery, umbrella plant and marble fruit bowl.	2002-04-09

The cast is magnificent, the script knows when to be faithful and when to adjust, the music is lovely, and the settings are lush perfection. Knowing all this, one does wonder about the many other people who brought this fine work to fruition. (If you have the DVD Special Edition, you may have met some of these individuals in the featurette &#34;The Making of Pride and Prejudice&#34;.) This book is absolutely loaded with pictures and photographs that cover every aspect of the work behind-the-scenes and in front of the camera, from location scouting to casting, music and choreography, costumes, makeup, filming and post-production. I especially enjoyed the long conversation with Colin Firth (Darcy), the head shots of the actors (who sometimes look very different than one expects -- Jennifer Ehle with blonde hair comes to mind!), the typical day's schedule, and the locations map. I learned a lot about this production and filmmaking in general.<br /><br />This book is interesting, informative and very entertaining.

First published in 1984, there is no mention of deconstruction's effect on academic departments, but otherwise the author seems to address most issues pertinent to the reading and writing of fiction, beginning with a wonderful chapter on the lovely metaphoric City of Invention.  Elsewhere, Weldon discusses non-literature, Latin, a writer's relatives and friends, feminism, literary truth, critics and invention.  Austen is here as well,and the author enlightens with her discussions of Austen's life, times, works, style and death.  There are many wonderful passages, and I especially admired the analyses of Austen's work, but I would have liked more of this, and in more detail.  At one point the author writes: \\"[Jane Austen] knows how to end a scene, an episode, a chapter, before beginning the next: when to allow the audience to rest, when to and how to underline a statement, when to mark time with idle paragraphs, allowing what went before to settle, before requiring it to inform what comes next.  It is a very modern technique.  It requires ... consciousness of audience, and audience reaction.\\"  It should be evident from that passage that Weldon is an elegant, insightful and articulate writer, and I would have *loved* to have seen extended examples and analysis of specific Austen passages to illustrate the points made in the preceding excerpt.<br />Ultimately, I didn't think the niece's subplot worked.  Weldon first advises her not to attempt to write a novel, and then advises her to write it, and then advises her about dealing with the publisher when the novel is not only published but very successful.  What's Weldon's greater meaning?  Why would this undergrad's novel be published and who is reading it?  Is it a condemnation or just a device to drive the conceit?<br />I learned a lot about Jane Austen and about writing, and got some help for the next time someone tells me it's a waste of time to read a novel.

It offers to be a friendly and casual guide, and that is exactly what it is.  There are 15 chapters, distinguished by topic: PMS movies, dysfunctional romances, seeking greener pastures, mother-issues, earth mother films, working girl blues, bad hair days, dumped and looking for revenge movies, happily ever after movies, hearing your inner voice, martyr syndrome, girl's night out, men behaving well, women behaving badly, father-issues and cult films. The approach is breezy and mildly informative. Each chapter begins with a one or two page humorous essay followed by viewing suggestions, each with a paragraph or two of description and comments, and a miscellany of quotes, facts and opinions. The second chapter, for example, &#34;Yeah, Okay, So He's a Jerk, But He's Sooooo Cute!: Dysfunctional Romances&#34; features No Man of Her Own (1932), Suspicion (1941), Spellbound (1945), A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), Charade (1963), Funny Girl (1968), American Gigolo (1980), The Shining (1980), The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981), Sid and Nancy (1986), Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights (1992), Ethan Frome (1993), Gaslight (1944), Immortal Beloved (1994), Legends of the Fall (1994), Leaving Las Vegas (1995), Never Talk to Strangers (1995) and Love Serenade (1996).<br /><br />The films that are recommended are interesting and appropriate choices I thought.  I enjoyed reading about films I'd already seen and appreciated the description of those I hadn't. There is a fair amount of humorous filler, which works because the authors are good writers and funny.  Complemented by a good index, this is not a book to read straight through, but rather to be perused as the mood hits.	2002-04-04

And ever since then you keep getting your hopes up that the next National Lampoon film will actually be ,,,, you know, funny .... but it never happens.  That's how I felt about this book -- high expectations followed by disappointment.  Did all the funny people graduate and go to law school or something?<br /><br />Based on other reviews it seems people either love this book or hate it, and I am on the fringes of the latter camp.  I had high hopes.  I was interested in an irreverent and more honest take on the founding fathers and it had been praised by people I respected (Howard Zinn, I feel betrayed!).  I wanted to like it, but I was really disappointed -- not hating it so much as being pretty bored.  I felt the book droned on and on and on, and then I'd see I'd only read another 10 pages.  Usually I get through a book in two or three days; this took me almost three times as long.  It was a struggle to finish it.  I think a book should be entertaining and/or thought-provoking.  This was neither.<br /><br />The premise is great and the author is talented.  He writes as if he's been to 18th century America and come back to tell us about it.  There's no denying that his descriptions are great, but the characters never rise above two-dimensional puppets, gumping around without motive or reason.  Well-known figures are lampooned but not better understood, and unknown characters, in particular and unfortunately the two protagonists John and Deborah, are never revealed as complex or interesting.  The action is erratic and confusing.  The POV changes ... but just often enough to be awkward.  The humor is great but fades fast and never returns.  Anachronistic speech and actions disrupt the narrative flow.  I believe the revisionist facts are accurate but this book just wasn't pleasurable to read.<br /><br />The style is raw.  As in junior high school. One example: instead of taking some effort to introduce the characters of the Boston leadership, the author LISTS them with this introduction: &#34;Oh, the men from the Green Dragon, they ruled. There was Hancock and Otis and Warren and Church and, of course, the Adamses: Samuel and John .... Each his own brand of mad.&#34;  And then he devotes a paragraph or two to each person and gives us irreverent facts about each one.  On the level of the &#34;so very fat&#34; John Adams. Hmm. Insightful. And then he goes back to the story. Clunk. The author brings the streets to life, but never the people on them.<br /><br />Like I said, I wanted to like it. I just didn't. It's not that I didn't &#34;get&#34; it. It's that I was bored and irritated -- not the feelings I want a book to evoke. A much richer, entertaining and accurate book covering the same era is Kenneth Roberts' Oliver Wiswell, and this is one of those instances when the simple truth is so compelling that it doesn't need embellishment or titillation to make it palatable. Why not read something where you have to rub two brain cells together?<br /><br />Because the reviews are so polarized, there is a chance you will like this book even though I didn't.  Obviously some people really liked it, and maybe you will too.

It was an epiphany. With spectacularly clear words and explanations Abbott related, in a first person narrative, the thoughts and experiences of A. Square as he explained his own two-dimensional world and explored others of varying dimension. After reading it, I looked at the world in a new way. It was one of the first books I ever wrote in; I was so excited with thought that I underlined, punctuated, and jotted ideas down in the margins -- breaking a lifelong habit of respecting books by treating them like sacred objects. I was grateful to Abbott for his ideas and his lucidity. Breaching biology and time, he had awakened in me a new appreciation of the aesthetics of science and mathematics. Now, here comes Ian Stewart to make this wonderful book even more interesting!<br /><br />This book is a pleasure in so many ways. The quality of the paper and typesetting are exceptional, the layout is clear, the annotator is a talented writer, and the volume is generously augmented with photo reproductions and line drawings. Stewart's text is just wonderful. While the preface begins with a question: \\"What is Flatland and why should it be annotated?\\" and continues with Professor Stewart's reasoning and motivation in tackling this subject, the introduction focuses on Flatland's author, Edwin Abbott Abbott. Stewart is a fine writer and I learned a lot in both sections. But that is just an appetizer. Stewart states in the preface that his intellectual pursuit of all things Flatland led him down many paths and, taking his cue from long-time interesting thinker Martin Gardner, he lets the information flow. Annotations vary in length, from one paragraph to several pages, and cover a magnificent range of subjects, each made entertaining, informative and relevant. One would expect, and does find, mathematics explanations, but Stewart also draws intellectual connections between Abbott and his contemporaries, explains historical references and contextualizes Abbott's contributions to scholarly thought.<br /><br />I learned something on every page, and enjoyed the reading of it. Stewart has produced a volume that can be compared favorably to Gardner's Annotated Alice in Wonderland, for which he expresses admiration. While this scintillating annotated version of Abbott's classic text should prove delightful for those interested in mathematics, physics, or the history of science, it will be irresistibly fascinating for any fan of Flatland.<br />Well done.

This is a book that not only entertains confirmed fans but might also persuade others of her worth.  I agree with another reviewer that this would be a great addition to a high school course.  It is a book that can be as easily pored over as dipped into, being composed of a large number of short blurbs, quizzes, anecdotes, interviews, lists and even a recipe.  A perfect book for the bathroom.<br />The author is very knowledgeable and yet relates her information in a friendly and accessible way, beginning with descriptions of the various types of Austen fans, and quickly moving on to chapters about Jane's early life and juvenilia, each of the six major works, and Jane's legacy: film adaptations, fan clubs, internet presence, continuations and sequels.  The book concludes with a bibliography and index.<br />This is a fun read and there's no way you won't learn something interesting.  A must-read for fans and a great supplement for reluctant readers.	2002-03-26

I think the style and the content are consistent with the author's Redwall novels. In the right-hand pocket are an instruction booklet; a foldout sheet that depicts the abbey grounds and opens to about 1-1/2 by 2 feet; 19 pieces which are clearly labelled and fold-out, tuck in and eventually become a rather impressive tabletop abbey, including the great hall (complete with the tapestry hanging over the mantle), the Redwall stairs, a storeroom, bedrooms, the kitchen, gatehouse and outer walls. The gatehouse and walls are particularly satisfying, going up easily and looking great. The material is thin cardboard and the manipulations are more interesting than just simple folds. No cutting or gluing is required though a little bit of tape helps stabilize the model. I think this is a good quality accessory for fans. Assembly takes about an hour and when complete the abbey is fun to look at. There are lots of cool details like candlesticks and birds in the beams and \\"Redwall\\" written near the stairs, though I did miss the dishevelled tomes of the gatehouse.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Redwall universe *is* the availability of interesting supplemental material -- the quiz book, books for younger readers, this abbey. Personally, I would love to see Mr. Jacques publish a Redwall cookbook -- the dishes at the feasts always sound so delectable.<br /><br />Though this is a bit expensive for older kids and is not sturdy enough for young children or older kids who want to use it as an action figure hangout, I would recommend this fun set-up for ages 8 and up. Because the instructions are clearly written and supplemented with lots of illustrations, this would be an excellent and rewarding intermediate level model for children ready to graduate to a project requiring written insruction, and would be a fun project for parents and children working together. Enthusiastic adult Redwall fans will like it, kids will adore it.level model for children ready to graduate to a project requiring written insruction, and would be a fun project for parents and children working together.

It met all expectations, and I pampered myself by taking bits of time to read Regan MacDuff's adventures.  She is an intelligent and resourceful young woman, and I liked her and her friend Oma.  The story was not a disappointment, making me laugh with its outrageousness even as I quickly turned the pages.  Regan is the youngest of the twin daughters of newly widowed Sorcha MacDuff in AD 929 Scotland.  Sorcha is driven by a thirst for revenge that will change her daughters' lives.  Favored Gruoch will become the lady of their ancestral lands as well as the major lands adjoining, but her legacy comes at the price of Regan's virginity, as Regan takes her twin's place on her bridal night to prevent the groom from knowing Gruoch is not a maiden.  Soon, with an heir coming, Regan is in the way and to prevent her from ever giving birth to a potential rival heir, she is sent to a distant convent to spend the rest of her life.  Within hours of her arrival, however, she is raped and sent off to a slaver with other girls victimized by the sadistic Mother Eubh, including her future companion Oma.  The man who buys her finds her so exquisite that he is going to have her trained by a legendary Passion Master and then presented as the centerpiece of a parade of priceless gifts presented to a powerful and influential caliph.  And that's just the first 50 pages (of 400)!<br />From there, things were not as strong.  There were a lot of exciting sex scenes, but the romance of Zaynab and Karim was two dimensional.  You could see why they admired each other, but other relationships were more complex and interesting than this one.  But what I was most disturbed by was the violence, and to me it's amazing that even those who are critical of the author's efforts here have not even mentioned it, whereas I would go so far as to say it ruined this book for me.  I can enjoy brutes and naughtiness right along with the next person when it comes to reading a romance, but there is some disturbing violence here, a suicide, graphic torture and the death of children.

It met all expectations, and I pampered myself by taking bits of time to read Regan MacDuff's adventures. She is an intelligent and resourceful young woman, and I liked her and her friend Oma. The story was not a disappointment, making me laugh with its outrageousness even as I quickly turned the pages. Regan is the youngest of the twin daughters of newly widowed Sorcha MacDuff in AD 929 Scotland. Sorcha is driven by a thirst for revenge that will change her daughters' lives. Favored Gruoch will become the lady of their ancestral lands as well as the major lands adjoining, but her legacy comes at the price of Regan's virginity, as Regan takes her twin's place on her bridal night to prevent the groom from knowing Gruoch is not a maiden. Soon, with an heir coming, Regan is in the way and she is sent to a distant convent to prevent her from ever giving birth to a potential rival heir. Within hours of her arrival, however, she is raped and sent off to a slaver with other girls, including her future companion Oma, victimized by the sadistic Mother Eubh. The man who buys her finds her so exquisite that he is going to have her trained by a legendary Passion Master and then presented as the centerpiece of a parade of priceless gifts presented to a powerful and influential caliph. And that's just the first 50 pages (of 400)!<br />From there, things were not as strong. There were a lot of exciting scenes, but the romance of Zaynab and Karim was two dimensional. You could see why they admired each other, but other relationships were more complex and interesting than this one. But what I was most disturbed by was the violence, and to me it's amazing that even those who are critical of the author's efforts here have not even mentioned it, whereas I would go so far as to say it ruined this book for me. I can enjoy brutes and naughtiness right along with the next person when it comes to reading a romance, but there is some disturbing violence here in the form of a mass murder, a suicide, graphic torture and the death of children. I need escape from my escape literature! C'mon, Bertrice, lighten up!<br />I also would have liked to have some closure on the Gruoch storyline, though I probably will not buy a sequel to get that closure, and may not read a Bertrice Small book again.  I am sick of violence.	2002-03-06
1639148:US	52753467	R1UVJ4L7XA0L28	0201050714	974186648	The Continuum Concept: In Search Of Happiness Lost (Classics in Human Development)	Books	3	376	418	N	Y	timeless kernel of wisdom within a flawed tract	Somehow I had the impression that Jean Liedloff's diamond-in-the-rough work was a comparison of modern day parenting to that of primitive tribes in general; instead, it is primarily her observations on the Yequana tribe of Venezuela.  It's obvious that Ms. Liedloff has a great affection for these peaceful people, but that positive bias is apparent, and eventually weakens her argument.  It is also often necessary for the reader to make decisions about whether the author, writing in 1975, should be forgiven for her (currently) strange ideas -- using the universal \\"he\\" and \\"man\\" can certainly roll off one's back, but  proclaiming that male homosexuality is the result of a mother's demanding and overattentive nature and female homosexuality the result of cruel or unloving fathers is not so forgivable.  If this theory were true it should have better predictive value, yet who today believes her assertion?  In addition, Liedloff avers that children's accidents and burns are not caused by children's physical or cognitive limitations but primarily by subconscious suggestions from the parents, even relating (and she should be ashamed) the story of a toddler who died in a drowning accident that was, according to her, caused not only by the parents' admonitions to stay away from the pool but also by their installation of a security fence around it.  Furthermore, roller coaster devotees are actually attempting to capture the experience of adventure denied them as children (I can attest from personal experience that this is not the case), and criminality and addiction are explained by the lack of in-arms time, as are child abuse (discussed solely in terms of women abusing their children), promiscuity, martyrdom, acting, academics and compulsive travelling.  Neat trick, if you can make it work.  I didn't even know compulsive travelling was a problem.  That said, this is the theory as created *and interpreted* by Liedloff, and her  misapplication of the continuum concept does not invalidate the theory, any more than Sigmund Freud's personal problems invalidated his few brilliant insights into the human psyche.<br /><br />The author's positive bias also shows up in her willingness to view every act by the Yequana as positive, including parties and work sessions at which all tribe members, including children, drink to drunkenness.  She lauds the Yequana's lack of parental guidance, saying that praise and scolding are equally corrosive to the child's ability to function later in life.  I disagree with that assertion.  I believe feedback is important, and I believe in praise and encouragement.<br /><br />The author shrugs off anomalies such as the Yequanas, despite their having achieved perfect serenity, nonetheless having a mythology of a fall from grace and a yearning to achieve a better state.  She also ignores contradictions, stating that modern humans search for physical contact because we were denied it in early life, but the Yequana enjoy physical contact because .... this is not explained.  These particular passages convince me that the Yequana probably have a more realistic self-regard than does Ms. Liedloff.  Reading this, in it's unfinished, untested, doctoral-thesis-that-never-got-turned-in state, you can see why scientific methods, for all their limitations, are valuable.<br /><br />Having criticized, I will say that when the author gets it right, she gets it profoundly right.  Simple statements she makes are well stated and ring true: The intellect is not always our only, or our best, guide.  There is an evolutionary dance, informed by experience, between expectation and design.  A spirit of competition is not always appropriate.  We need to make the assumption of innate sociality.  Happiness should be a normal condition rather than a goal.  Parents do not own children.  Children, though less physically powerful, are no less human and have no fewer rights than adults; consequently, children should be treated with respect and dignity.<br /><br />While the Liedloff version of the continuum concept had little predictive value in the area of social science, she shows some timely insight into what was then becoming cognitive science, and offers some fertile material for artificial systems modelers.<br /><br />As a parent, an education librarian and a substitute teacher, I thoroughly enjoyed the author's introduction of the ironically radical underpinnings of attachment parenting concepts as well as her suggestions for social change.  As a cognitive science researcher and an optimistic populist, I was nonplussed by the lack of any bibliography or research -- just opinion and anecdote.  There are some tremendously valuable insights here, but the author has slathered it with her own problematic conclusions.  For pity's sake, ignore her advice about child safety, which is not appropriate for 21st century parents.  My advice is to read this book with an open heart and a sharp mind, and to cull the wheat from the chaff.version of the continuum concept had little predictive value in the area of social science, she shows some timely insight into what was then becoming cognitive science, and offers some fertile material for artificial systems modelers.

Stephen Biesty deserves an entry in Who's Who for thinking of this wonderful format for readers who wonder.  This is a wonderful and exciting book for older kids and adults who are curious about how things work behind-the-scenes.  While it can be tricky for younger children to envision how the objects go back together, there will ample material for others to enjoy.  Eighteen human-made objects are cross-sectioned: a castle, an observatory, a galleon, ocean liner and submarine, a coal mine, military tank, oil rig, cathedral, jumbo jet and car factory, a helicopter, an opera house, a steam train and a subway station, a fishing trawler, the Empire State Building and the space shuttle.  The sections are filled with defining activity, and Richard Platt's accompanying text is informative and amusing.<br />First published in 1992, this book is also a fascinating testament to the breathtaking pace of change we experience.  Many of the objects have changed a great deal in the past decade, so this is more a snapshot of one era's mechanisms than a blueprint of state-of-the-art technology.  For that reason the book succeeds spectacularly with historic objects such as the castle and galleon, and only slightly less so with outdated items like the tank and helicopter.<br />If you are interested in how things work, these unique views of engineering marvels in operation will thrill you.	2002-02-26

This book is perfect. It is divided into three sections: Where Do I Start, What Should I Paint, and What are the Basics.<br /><br />It begins at the beginning, discussing the choice of medium and theme; the selection, acquisition and care of supplies; and the choice of subject. It then moves on to technique: how to render a three-dimensional object on paper; how to compose a study; how to paint color, pattern and texture; painting space, depth and distance.<br /><br />The instructions are augmented by lots of pictures. You will see the step-by-step way to paint a tree, a face, a still life, a landscape etc. The final section really covers the basics -- mixing colors, types of paints, brushes, accessories, palette layouts, preparing canvases, paper, correcting mistakes, pencils, inks .... Every page is interesting. I learned so much. A glossary and index complete this wonderful resource.<br /><br />The writing is clear and the many photos and illustrations are fabulous. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. If you are interested in teaching art or learning to paint, you cannot go wrong.	2002-02-24

Arrives as ~10 by 12 inch folder opening to reveal two pockets -- one containing the fold-out and the other a 4 x 8\\" booklet about Monet and his garden, with twelve wonderful illustrations and photographs. The fold-out is about 8-1/2 x 11\\" and folds out to nine 8-1/2 x 11\\" flats, six lying flat and making up the garden and three that stand perpendicular in support of the buildings depicted.

Eight representations of Escher's work are presented in black-and-white with one or two sentences of analysis and/or an explanatory quote by the artist.  These short comments are interesting and informative, and it is made clear that Escher is precisely an artist whose ideas and work should be presented three-dimensionally.  The eight presentations are: Ascending and Descending, Drawing Hands, Puddle, Hand with Reflecting Sphere, Mobius Strip II, Regular Division of the Plane V, Relativity, and Tower of Babel.<br /><br />These renditions don't knock your socks off, but they are thought-provoking and interesting -- fun for adults, not so much for children.	2002-02-24
1651348:US	52753467	R256F0I6PA0UNF	0966077814	896144444	The Diary of Henry Fitzwilliam Darcy	Books	4	5	5	N	Y	marvelous concept, good execution	I thought this was an excellent concept for a Pride and Prejudice sequel, and the timeline (from Darcy's tenth birthday to about a year after his marriage to Elizabeth Bennett) was inspired, allowing us to discover why Darcy is so proud, what his parents were like and how that affected his personality, etc., in addition to the great enjoyment of reading Darcy's perspective on the events described in P&P. I think this might have worked better if written as a commonplace book rather than a diary. If you've ever read Samuel Richardson's Clarissa, you will know what kind of implausible prose can emerge from a diary (and if you've ever read the letter written by Clarissa practically *as* she is being ravished by her reprehensible employer, you will never forget it (even if you want to)). So, while some of Darcy's gushing entreaties to his \\"Dear D.\\" seem a bit goofy, having chosen an awkward device the author succeeds better than some.<br />I do disagree with the author's creation of two rather strange episodes not related in Austen's original work: Elizabeth asking Darcy to remove a spider from her neck and him lowering her bodice to reach it (indeed!); and Darcy finding Elizabeth on a walk, putting her on his horse, outrunning a storm, and waiting the storm out together in a villager's cottage. Yikes, I think Austen would have mentioned these things happening! The cognitive dissonance I experienced when I ran up against these two scenes tells me that speculating about events and characters outside the timeline of the original work is okay, but going directly into the original and tinkering with it is less acceptable.<br />This is fun, simplistic lit-candy. The narrative is, implausibly, never marred by the machinations of Lydia and Wickham or Lady Catherine. Mrs. Bennett becomes amenable, for goodness sake. Darcy *likes* to dance -- and is good at it. Their horses even like each other. I can't believe he never told her to go buy a whole new wardrobe, but otherwise he was perfect. This is the champagne and rose petals-on-the-bed sequel, which is not necessarily a bad thing. It is what it is.<br />That said, the author has created authentic affection between these two inherently interesting characters, and has written from a man's POV believably. This is an affectionate portrait of the first year of marriage, and the narrative is more interesting when Elizabeth is on the scene. The first fight is believable and brief, satisfying the characters as written by Austen, and as near as Fasman is willing to introduce conflict.<br />Sometimes editing is lazy. There is a repeated paragraph and a switch in rank from Colonel to Captain and back again by one character, but all in all I liked this book.

If you use fresh fruits and vegetables in your cooking, you are undoubtedly aware that, while some foods may be available 365 days a year, they are usually most flavorful when they are grown and ripened naturally. Charts help make sense of the many varieties of produce available, and recipes are organized around the calendar, so you may find 'Red & Green Fresh Vegetables with Pasta' for summer, and 'Bread and Cabbage Soup' for winter. Each of four seasonal chapters lists the produce, flowers, dairy and meat available during that season.  In general these are basic recipes that can be made by the beginner cook.<br />My only complaint is that, with all the gorgeous photographs of the people and the market, there are no pictures of the finished dishes, a feature that I appreciate in a cookbook. Otherwise this is a great, and fun, cookbook with good recipes.	2002-02-17

Chapters include: Ancestral Archetypes, Healing Architecture, Harmony with the Land, Vernacular Wisdom, Cultural Identity, and Living the Dream, the last being examples of individuals and organizations using the principles espoused by the author.  There is some text, but what truly persuades are the many beautiful photographs, well chosen and accompanied by informative paragraphs.<br />Viewing these marvelous examples of harmonious architecture, one can be disheartened at the ugliness and mediocrity of so much architecture surrounding us.  But the book also teaches us to look in many places, old and new, near and far, to find examples of creative blendings of nature and humanity.<br />A lovely, inspiring book.	2002-02-17

I would say that the author almost succeeds in the first two objectives but fails, not surprisingly, in the last.  I don't expect many people to be able to write like Jane Austen, but I do expect something more substantive in the way of story.  While it was great to hang out with Elizabeth again, I didn't feel that I got to know Darcy better at all.  He is mentioned only in the most abstract terms.  For that matter, I didn't get to know anyone really.  The twenty five letters are all by Elizabeth to Jane.  It would have been more interesting to have correspondence from Jane to Elizabeth also, and maybe from Lydia as well.<br />While the letters capture the style of Austen's times, they are lightweight and rather brief.  Twenty-five letters with at least three blank pages between each letter comes out to about 115 pages of text.<br />I enjoyed this but was not blown away by it.	2002-02-16

Choo-Choo Charlie is a favorite with every member of the family.  It looks almost like a book sitting on the shelf, but in two simple unfoldings you have a complete little old-fashioned American rural town (circa 1910?) with pop-up buildings and cardboard stand-up characters and a cute wind-up engine and tender that run along the tiny track.  I think that alone fascinates our son.  He takes it off the shelf, \\"assembles \\" it, plays with it, puts it away, and does it all over again -- just for the delight of having a little town appear so magically.  A push button outside the station cafe renders realistic train noises, and the inside flaps of the \\"book\\" feature a poem about Choo-Choo Charlie and his busy day.<br />The only problem with the set is that it's made of thin cardboard and our son has already torn many of the buildings up.  On the other hand, it is one of the few toys that we will willingly replace because it is so delightful.  A charming toy.	2002-02-16

And after a while, Mommy comes home.<br />This is a nice book to help little ones deal with separation and worry, or a good read for animal lovers or kids who are afraid of animals.  The illustrations of these wide-eyed little creatures are heartwarming.  A good snuggle book.	2002-01-23

Who wouldn't be cheered up?<br />The illustrations are gentle but lively images of children playing around large letters.  I am not familiar with the Kaye-Wise-Lippman song others have referred to, but the book is enjoyable anyway.  Though I would rather have had a phrase for each letter of the alphabet rather than three strings (MNOP, QRST and WXYZ), I suppose that makes it fit the song.<br />Particularly useful when your toddler or young reader is down in the dumps, this gentle reminder tells them that they are special and loved and important.  If you know the tune, all the better!	2002-01-23

It starts gently, it becomes exuberant.  It is joyful.  And as the little boy of the book wakes and proceeds to greet the objects within his room and without, the light steadily grows, casting a glow on hazy pastel illustrations.  Good morning, pillow.  Good morning book.  Finally, daddy enters his room and the boy's most joyful 'Good Morning!' peals out as they hug.<br />There is a special joy in that time before everyone awakens, when one has the world to oneself.  Perhaps this book will help you appreciate, or awaken, that little morning person.	2002-01-23

Chapters are divided into idiosyncratic sections such as 'Saints and the Church' and 'Socks and Buttons, Dresses and Nightcaps'.  Each phrase is given in its original language with its American translation and a 10-100 word explanation that might include its origin, history or popular use.<br />Originally published in 1988, this handy 5-1/2 by 8&quot; volume would not be a reliable guide to slang but because the author covers mainstream phrases that will tend to be remembered and passed along, it will remain a useful book.  The accompanying explanations are entertaining and informative, and the inclusion of Latin makes this book irresistible.<br />Nicely done.	2002-01-23

Instead, a lunch thief is taking the best bits out of his lunch bag every day, Leigh's parents are separated, and Leigh's dad has his dog. During a class assignment, Leigh's overwhelming feelings come pouring out to the author of a book he has enjoyed.  Told in diary entries and Leigh's series of letters to this distant figure, the story covers several years and organically illustrates Leigh's burgeoning maturity.  Originally isolated, Leigh enters into some friendships and begins to value himself.  Conversations are realistic and character development is authentic.<br />I enjoyed the authors works as a kid, and I think she holds up extremely well.  This book was originally published in 1983, and is still relevant and accessible.	2002-01-21

This book came out ten years after Tolkien's trilogy, and though it would be difficult to avoid all similarities to that archetypal work, there are some surprisingly similar elements -- but also some that are very imaginative and original (an oracular pig!).<br />Taran is a pre-teen boy who is bored with his job and friends and village.  He longs for adventure and, as he soon finds out, he should be careful what he wishes for!  Looking for a runaway pig, Taran soon runs into danger, and must venture far from his home.  Along the way he meets characters such as Eilonwy and Gwydion who will help him, and others he must fear.<br />Sometimes Eilonwy's ubiquitous use of metaphors gets tiresome, and the volume would benefit from the inclusion of a map, but overall this is a highly readable story with an interesting cast of characters, good pacing, minimal violence,  positive character development, teamwork and cooperation, adventure and lessons about the consequences of choice.	2002-01-12

Many people seem to agree that he excels in descriptive details, bringing the past to life. But his narrative frames are wonderful too -- this novel's prologue is intriguing, and a number of interesting characters are introduced. It's a shame this is a throwaway chapter, intended to introduce the consequences of time travel and the ways that observers (in The Project) might discover and analyse them. I would have enjoyed updates with this group to see the effects of various actions on the part of protagonist Si Morley. But this was Finney's book to write, and it's a fine novel.  The old photographs are fun to look at and are incorporated smoothly into the story.<br />I suggest that you do not buy this book if you want to read a technical and plausible method for travelling to the past. This is a fantastical opera, in the fine tradition of soap opera and space opera. It is more concerned with painting vivid experience of a past time, as if the novel itself were a time machine. If you are a tech-head, press the \\"Back\\" button and search elsewhere. If you are an impressionistic history buff, you will have a grand old time in old New York.	2002-01-12

He tells us what he likes about a passing train (&quot;I like trains that hoot and roar/as they rumble by my door&quot;), and the surprise at the end is sweet.  Illustrations are bright, outlined scenes in a rural setting.  Some illustrations are very simple and others are filled with activity.  The boy's dad is mentioned and seen in the story, nice for kids to see.  And, as a bonus, the endpages show and describe the various kinds of train cars -- the tender and engine, a hopper, boxcar, flatcars, a tanker, gondolas and the caboose.  This is a deceptively simple book that can be a joy and an enrichment for you and your little train lover.	2002-01-12

As the book opens, Will is excited about his approaching eleventh birthday, but he is also alarmed by strange goings on in the neighborhood -- the birds are acting strangely and none of the family's animals will approach him. Soon Will learns why these things are happening. He is about to be indoctrinated into his rightful position as the last of the Old Ones -- an ancient race that has been protecting the world from the conquest of evil. Now it's Will's turn to shoulder some of the burden and participate in the struggle. That's an awful lot for an 11-year old to take on! But Will is not alone. He meets others who will help him, in particular Merriman, a gruff but kindly mentor figure.<br />&quot;This night will be bad. And tomorrow will be beyond imagining.&quot; Susan Cooper is a gifted writer and she sets a mood of foreboding creepiness right from the beginning. While there is an almost constant aura of menace, there is minimal violence, and Will constantly learns lessons of bravery, honor, and the importance of knowledge and learning. Sort of H. P. Lovecraft meets the Hardy Boys.<br />I agree with some criticism that there is too little struggle and problem solving involved in actually getting the six signs Will needs to find, but the story is still strong and a worthwhile read for middle readers.	2002-01-12

Instead, it is similar to a dictionary, being a 63-page volume of alphabetically arranged technical definitions, from aquatint to wood-engraving.  It is also more than a dictionary, having more than 60 examples to illustrate techniques and methods.<br />This book is neither historical nor biographical in focus, but you will learn a great deal of technical information.	2002-01-02

The author has a quiet humor that works nicely, and the characters were interesting.  The Darcy-update, actor Harry Noble, is a likeable and compelling lead; the female protagonist, Jasmin 'Jazz' Field is also nicely written.  The book is not flawless.  While Austen was always consistent in her POV -- we consistently saw and heard and thought the same things Elizabeth Bennett saw and heard and thought -- the text here is sometimes jarring in its change of perspective, even between paragraphs.  The occasional cussing is also disconcerting.  There are some clumsy, and unnecessary, contrivances to make the story mirror Austen's exactly.<br />Despite those problems, I enjoyed the book very much and was excited when the protagonists finally 'found' each other, just as I am each time I re-read the original.<br />Nathan is a gifted writer, and I will definitely read her next book.	2002-01-02

In some ways I thought this was the best of them all -- Mrs. Malloy is hysterical here and the premise revolving around romance fiction is funny as well.  But there are also minor problems.  The mystery itself is confusing -- lots of people die, but not necessarily of unnatural causes, and the tension never really builds; the depiction of the village's two librarians is lazy and stereotypical; and two of Cannell's best characters, Freddy and Jonas, are not here -- they are away on a camping trip!<br />Despite the problems this is a fun book.  I would recommend it if you are a fan of the author, but not if you are mainly interested in reading a challenging mystery.	2002-01-02

I think it was bad for Stephanopoulos to write the book while his old friends and colleagues were still working, and I think it made their job harder.  As interested as I was in the author's perspective, it seemed wrong to read the book earlier.<br /><br />On television and in the documentary film, The War Room, Mr. Stephanopoulos comes across as a little arrogant and more than a little anxious, and that impression is not dispelled in these pages. However, given the opportunity, the author also shows himself to be fairly honest about his own character flaws, owning up to mistaken motives and actions before (&#34;[Little girl], your daddy is a very bad man.&#34;), during (advising Clinton not to face the press after Waco), and after (&#34;It could lead to impeachment proceedings.&#34;) his years at the White House.  We are introduced to the young altar boy who later decides to challenge his community's and his own expectations of becoming a priest, and we follow the young politico as he learns his trade from veterans like James Carville and Dick Gephardt.<br /><br />It seems appropriate that this young Greek (pride in his heritage is strongly felt here) should play counterpoint to Bill Clinton, the classic Aristotelian hero, and while the book is more about George Stephanopoulos than Bill Clinton, the narrative does come to life when the President is on the page.  Not surprising, I guess.  The author's style also smooths out when he writes about his archenemy, Dick Morris.  At other times, the book is interesting but not insightful, and chatty without being either gossipy or overly informative.  It was interesting to read about Team Clinton's Supreme Court wooing of Mario Cuomo, and there is generally enough substance to keep an interested reader happy.  It's difficult not to enjoy an insider's look at the Clinton presidency, and the author enjoys writing about the man himself, though not usually in the kindest light.<br />There is also enough glitter quality to titillate celebrity fans ... we learn that Rush Limbaugh attended the Carville-Matalin wedding and that Jennifer Grey (at least once) drew George a bath.<br />At the end of the book, the author writes: &#34;(I was) wondering what might have been -- if only this good president had been a better man.&#34;  After reading this book, I felt the same way about the administrative team under Clinton.  By all accounts Clinton relied heavily on others' opinions, and a lot of the advice he was getting, from Stephanopoulos and others, was not very good advice.  It makes me wonder how different things might have been -- if Dick Morris had principles, if Monica Lewinsky had morals, if Newt Gingrich had a heart ... if George Stephanopoulos had twenty years' more experience.  Given Beltway insiders' proclivity for jumping the fence between politics and journalism, I would not be surprised to see Stephanopoulos working within another administration someday.  One hopes that he will internalize the lessons he seems to have learned within these pages.  That would make for interesting politics indeed.ere is also enough glitter quality to titillate celebrity fans ... we learn that Rush Limbaugh attended the Carville-Matalin wedding and that Jennifer Grey (at least once) drew George a bath.

This is the weaker of the two.  In this one you examine all the Jellaby transportation devices under the pretext of their being used at the Jelly World Fair.  In the other, &quot;Where Is Pepper?&quot;, the writing is a bit better.

One would think that this would involve deciding on a tool, researching its history and uses, and writing it up.  But that would be too linear.  Instead, the author takes us on a rambling walk through the toolbox.  We learn not only about the development of many tools and machines (adze, augur, hammer, lathe, gears and presses), but about the scientists and inventors, even financiers, who contributed to the development of the screwdriver, and the applications (early firearms and clocks) that helped (literally) shape the device.  We learn about the Phillips versus the Robertson screw, and the limitations of earlier lathes, which led to the first screws being handmade.  Many interesting facts like this entertain and inform.<br /><br />As a librarian I appreciated the author's friendly discussion of the references he found useful for his research.  There are many black-and-white line drawings to help you visualize the items being discussed, as well as a notes section, a good index, and illustration credits.<br /><br />Weaknesses:  I would have liked to have read a brief discussion of the (seven?) Simple Machines, as I think many were discussed here, and it would have been an interesting reminder of things from physics class that I've forgotten.  In addition, I looked up a quote by Plutarch in the Notes section, and the citation began &#34;Quoted by E. J. Dijksterhuis .... &#34; with no information about the actual source -- not much help!<br /><br />This was a fun read.  If you are the kind of person who enjoys browsing through the dictionary or a bookstore, you will probably enjoy this little gem of a volume by this handyman-storyteller.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2001-12-01

The authors' philosophy seems to be one of &#34;less is more&#34; -- making the case, in an interesting and literate foreword and five introductory chapters, that books can be useful and even important resources for trying to help your child figure out what makes life interesting.  These books can help provide role models, teach empathy, and transport the reader to a different world or state of mind.  The authors de-emphasize problem novels for young adults, which they feel teach self-acceptance rather than improvement and whose authors often sacrifice story for message, opting instead for the mythic, transportive style.  I've read a lot of children's literature and still found a number of new and interesting titles here.<br /><br />Books are divided into genre and then age group (4-8, 8-12, 12+).  There is a good science fiction/fantasy section.  Other chapters include: picture books; fables and fairy tales; myths, legends and folktales; sacred texts; books for holidays and holy days; historical fiction; contemporary fiction (post WWII); and biography.<br /><br />The book list contains about 300 books and includes title, author, illustrator, publisher, year of publication and number of pages, as well as a one-page summary of the plot and brief discussion of issues or virtues covered in the selection.  Also included: a list of the books, in the order they appear, sans commentary; a short chapter about the Book List; a list of twenty videos deemed worthwhile viewing; a notes section in case you want to delve deeper; and an index.  The index is the weak link here.  For example, on page 35, one sentence ends &#34; ... just as most good parents, whatever their views on censorship, tend to buy their children books by A. A. Milne and Mark Twain rather than books by the Marquis de Sade.&#34;  Then the Marquis de Sade is in the index (!) while useful subject terms, like 'loneliness' and 'friendship', are not.

Pullman's trilogy fits into the latter category.  He is a fine writer -- balancing multiple story lines that interconnect and support each other; each character is well drawn, complex and believable; situations are dramatic and interesting.<br /><br />This final installment of Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy is not disappointing.  It lives up to the preceding volumes, which is a rarity in serial publications (even Tolkien fell down a bit with Return of the King).  I was prepared for a rotten ending after reading many criticisms of it in the reviews here, but I liked the ending -- bittersweet, tragic and hopeful all at once. I would say that the only thing I didn't like was that Lyra slept through one-third of the book!  Without giving any spoilers I will say that there are several scenes that are as emotionally packed as anything I've read.<br /><br />Two notes:  (1) People who DO put spoilers into their reviews should warn or label them as such beforehand.  (2) Frankly, zealotry is tiresome, and it would be nice if commentaries did not have to include reviewers' belief systems. Can't you just relax and read for enjoyment? This book is in the *fantasy* genre. Open your mind a little bit and don't be so threatened by ideas.	2001-11-14

The action takes place between April 1775 and February 1779. Tim Meeker begins as an 11-year old boy; his father runs the town's tavern and general store and remains loyal to the English king, while his beloved older brother Sam has just run off to join the Rebels and fight for freedom from the British.<br />The narrative voice of Sam is effective and well-written. A lot of choices are made and many changes take place for anyone between the ages of eleven and fifteen, but just imagine if you were also going through those important times while the American Revolution was happening around you!  Sam is confused. He doesn't understand all the issues and has seen acts of good and bad from both sides. He loves his father and his brother. He cannot decide where his loyalties lie.  Sam's dilemma makes clear that the Revolution was really America's first civil war -- neighbors fought neighbors, people were right and wrong on both sides, and everyone suffered.<br /><br />This is a realistic book with no struggles or acts beyond the believable abilities of the characters involved.  There is no explicit violence but the narrator sees a beheading and an execution, so this book would be inappropriate for young readers; but it captures the dilemmas of growing up and the difficulties of the Revolution in a way that would make it interesting and valuable to pre-teens and teenagers.	2001-11-09

Books	4	35	36	N	Y	not perfect, but very good	The packaging is very nice here, being a book cover which, when opened, reveals an attached booklet of quizzes on the left and a fold-out map on the right.<br /><br />The quiz book covers the first ten Redwall books and contains five quizzes of seven to eleven questions: Places and Journeys, Heroes and Heroines, Rogues and Villains, Dreams and Quests, and Food and Feasts.  There are also five riddles taken from the Redwall books, and all answers are given at the back.  I didn't think these questions were overly easy.  They are not multiple choice, and if you read the ten books before taking the quizzes, how can you remember the &#34;four other titles of Gabool the Wild&#34; or all the ingredients of the Great Hall cake, for instance?  Some, where a riddle is given and the solution requested, are easier than others.<br /><br />The map folds out to about three feet by two feet and is nice as a very general map.  I was hoping that it would be more of a combination of all the ten books' maps, with all the labelling from them, but most of the specific places from those maps aren't noted.  Also, it would have been nice to have sites marked where interesting plot elements occurred.  Still, it is fun to have a big map of the Redwall universe.<br /><br />All in all, this was slightly disappointing, but still a lot of fun.	2001-11-08

As usual, there are several story lines to follow, which meet up at the concluding Abbey feast: the pathetic and delusional High Queen Slith, mother of the seven marauding Marlfoxes, and brooding about Marl Castle on an island in Hidden Lake; three young Abbey dwellers who steal off in the night to redeem themselves by rescuing the stolen Redwall tapestry; the Abbey dwellers and their Dibbuns, fighting off the Marlfoxes and their army of vermin<br />I thought all of the story lines were interesting and well written.  Sometimes when you read a book like this you get attached to one story line and hurry through lesser tales until you get to the characters you really like, but in this book I really enjoyed all of the characters and their adventures.  The ending was satisfying, and the descriptions of the feasts were, as usual, hunger-inducing.	2001-11-07

Fold-out pages complement Carle's unique illustrative style as we discover a looooooong ladder that reaches to the moon and back, and a magnificent four-page center spread revealing the full moon in all its glory.<br /><br />This fantastic tale for young children is sure to delight parents and kids.	2001-11-05

Books	4	3	3	N	N	fun lift-the-flap and stickers	This lift-the-flap book has five two-page spreads depicting scenes from the animated movie 'Monsters, Inc.'  Each page shows a scene that is busy and colorful, and has from five to nine flaps.  The flaps are well done, recreating the background so that the action on the flap is integrated into the scene.  A page of stickers (eyes, feet, mouths, etc.) allows a child to stick (and re-stick) these features within the book or on the blank monster on the back cover.<br />I would have given this book five stars except for two flaws: first, the flaps are really tough to get open, so an adult should go through the book first and loosen them; secondly, EVERY single one of the 37 stickers has 'copyright Disney/Pixar' printed on it -- a completed monster will have the copyright notice plastered on it at least ten times -- is that really necessary?	2001-11-05

This coloring and activity book arrives with four crayons, four watercolors and a paintbrush, and features coloring, a maze, puzzles, pattern matching, and drawing -- all of which lead to a party (with snacks!) for Blue and her friends: Mr. Salt, Mrs. Pepper, Paprika, Fifi and Freddy Felt, Shovel &amp; Pail, Slippery Soap, Tickety Tock, Gingerbread Boy and Baby Bear.  Each page is blank on the reverse so you can either tear out the page before painting or use the reverse to draw.<br />Crayons are non-toxic and paints are washable.

It's too bad these books are out-of-print -- at least one should be in every child's library!<br />As in other Anno works, an anonymous Everyman is seen in each textless pen-and-ink two-page spread.  In this book, the traveler rows ashore near the Cliffs of Dover, buys a horse near a small village, and rides through progressively more populated scenes -- and what scenes they are!  Filled with historical and literary allusions, mini-stories, children playing, panorama and touching detail -- all at the same time!  It would take a long time to describe even one illustration, let alone the whole book, but the content is rich and evocative.

It is definitely a fairy story in the tradition of the Brothers Grimm -- not for very young readers, but very entertaining for kids over 10, I'd say.  Three interconnected stories revolve around the deeds of the mysterious and ingenious Dr. Kalmenius and his dealings with princes, apprentices and clockwork mechanisms.  Though it is 109 pages long, the type is big and there are over 20 full-page illustrations, so this would be a good book for a child who shows an interest in the genre and seems ready to move on to a lengthier and more complex format.	2001-10-31

But after I began to read, I found myself making little notes of agreement in the margins, underlining sympathetic or insightful passages, and smiling at the experiences similar to my own. Even when an essay was not immediately relevant to me (such as the selections on adoption and raising twins), I found instances of shared experience with the writers, who seemed to be as awestruck and profoundly affected as me by their adventures in parenting.<br /><br />Oddly enough, in reviewing the book, I found I most enjoyed the selections by the male contributors -- delighted at similarities of common experience and enlightened by the differences -- often told with great humor. So this book also helped me to appreciate the unique experience of fatherhood.<br /><br />Very enjoyable.	2001-10-31

With a nice selection of 90 well-regarded books, each is devoted two pages and features a picture of the book's cover, a short description of the content, Circle Time presentation ideas, five story stretchers well marked in bold (Art, Snack Time, Math, Music, Science and Nature Center, Library Corner, etc.) with a learning objective, materials list, and instructions.  At the end of each chapter are the complete citations for the five featured books as well as a list of additional books related to the theme.<br /><br />An example of the content: the first theme is Families, and the five featured books are 'A Baby Sister for Frances', 'Me Too!', 'Whose Mouse Are You?', 'Five Minutes' Peace', and 'Titch'.  For 'Titch', story stretcher activities are: decorating t-shirts; listening to a tape of the story and turning the pages; counting to three; watching plants grow; making a pinwheel.  Other themes include Friendship, Feelings, Colors, Counting, and Transportation.<br /><br />As someone interested in homeschooling one child, I found that quite a few of these activities were inappropriate for me, but some were adaptable and others were as applicable to one child as to many.<br /><br />An appendix instructs one in binding a book, constructing a rebus chart and making art dough.  Separate indices list authors and illustrators; book titles (both featured and recommended); activities organized by type; and terms (objects, concepts and techniques used in the activities).<br /><br />Strengths: nice book selection; well-organized and presented.<br /><br />Weaknesses: activities are not consistently relevant or creative; no information is given about appropriate age or reading levels for the books or activities.<br /><br />Overall, I would say this is a valuable resource, particularly if you are working with a group of children and don't have the time or the knack for coming up with ideas of your own to expand on reading material.ve the time or the knack for coming up with ideas of your own to expand on reading material.	2001-10-20

This comes through in his latest offering, Jacques Pepin Celebrates.  The book is being published in conjunction with a 26-part PBS series (hurray!) and begins with the 26 menus which will make up the shows.  These include thirteen half-hour shows, among them: Country Luncheon, Dinner Party al Fresco, A Festive New Year's Eve, and Cold Snap Comfort; seven theme shows, such as: Puff Pastry Showcase, Bridal Shower Confections, and Tea for Ten; and six one-hour specials devoted to Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah, Easter, Graduation and Independence/Bastille Day.  Menus include suggested wines.<br /><br />The recipes are organized traditionally into chapters on: stocks and soups; eggs; fish; poultry; meat; appetizers and salads; breads; pastries; and desserts.  These are not recipes for beginners, but the techniques used are explained clearly and many recipes include informative step-by-step color photographs and pictures of the finished dish.<br /><br />In addition to the index, there is a separate list of the techniques which are illustrated throughout the book.<br /><br />Monsieur Pepin seems to be a talented and genuinely nice man.  The book is adorned with his lovely sketches, and the only thing that could improve it would be having the author as a dinner companion.	2001-10-20

In this novel, the first by sportswriter Jim Fergus, this event takes place in 1874 and, more importantly, the offer is accepted.  Now there's an interesting premise for you!<br /><br />Our protagonist and narrator is May Dodd, a woman who has been institutionalized by her influential family, and who uses the 'Brides for Indians' program as a way to escape the asylum.  May's journal entries begin in the train station as she and other volunteers depart for their western adventure.  Fergus has developed a wonderful narrative voice here -- an intelligent, observant woman caught up in an enthralling, if tragic, course of events.  We are immediately interested in her, her companions and their experiences, and there is not a boring passage in the book.<br /><br />Of course, as much as one roots for a happy ending, history demands that it will not be that simple.  It was not a time to be proud of, and the novel believably captures the sentiments and ideas of the times through interesting (though not necessarily complex) characters.<br /><br />The book gets off to a bit of a clunky start, with an author's note stating that yes, indeed, this is a work of fiction, and then an introduction by the fictitious descendant of the narrator (which does ultimately work as a framing device), and then a prologue relating the factually-based fictional incident in which the 'Brides for Indians' program is proposed; but as soon as May Dodd's journals begin, you will be loathe to put the book down.  Meticulous research and a real talent for writing from a woman's point of view ensure that you will learn even as you lose yourself in this entertaining and thought-provoking story.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2001-10-20

In this book, the traveler begins his trek alone, buys a horse and rides through progressively more populated scenes -- magnificent scenes, filled with literary and artistic allusions, mini-stories, children playing, panorama and touching detail -- all at the same time!  Scenes are viewed as if you were just outside the picture and about 40 feet high.  The reader/viewer cannot see the details of people's faces, but much human experience and emotion is contained in small details -- children despairing after a lost balloon, flirting lovers, a mother touching her child, etc.<br />Your child will appreciate this work through many 'reading' levels, and you will constantly make new discoveries yourself.<br />Mitsumasa Anno's books are not to be missed, and Anno's Journey is a beautiful example of the author/illustrator's work.	2001-10-19

If you remember cumulative stories such as &quot;the old woman who swallowed the fly (I don't know why she swallowed that fly)&quot;, then you'll know what to expect from this charming and funny book.

The stories run a wide gamut, and it was comforting to know that so many other people (including celebrities John Cleese, Lauren Hutton, Stephen Sondheim, Mike Nichols, Terry Jones, etc.) have troubled relations with their moms as well, but I didn't particularly find my mother in here. I guess she is uniquely troubled :-)<br /><br />It is an interesting and quick read whether you are interested in your relationship with your mother, your mother-in-law or your children, but you should not expect this book to solve your problems. It may get a conversation going though, and that is a good start.	2001-10-17

I wanted to keep them clean and beautiful.  Even after I went to university and started highlighting textbooks I made the distinction between a necessary utilitarian marking and my other books that I wanted to keep pristine.<br /><br />But then something wonderful happened.  I read a book that changed my life and I couldn't stop writing in it.  I underlined.  I took notes in the margins.  I wrote sideways when I ran out of room, and jotted my own ideas on the bottoms of the pages, finally resorting to filling up the blank endpages.  That experience changed my whole philosophy.  Since then I not only write in (my own) books when the spirit moves me, but I look for others' notes when I buy used books as well.  One of the most interesting books I have is by Eric Hoffer, the 'Longshoreman Philosopher', with notes written in it by at least three people besides myself.  I love that.<br /><br />Dr. Jackson addresses this heretofore neglected topic in terms of the physical (where it is placed), the historical (how attitudes about, and the function of, marginalia have changed), and the motivational (why people have left these traces).  The author uses six lengthy case studies to illustrate her ideas, particularly drawing on the influence of Samuel Coleridge and Boswell's Life of Johnson.  There are extensive notes, bibliographies of primary and secondary sources, and an index.<br /><br />The writing is a bit dry, but the work is informative and interesting.  The author really shines when she relates anecdotes, and I wish there would have been more of them as well as more illustrations --with only nine examples shown, I was really anxious to see more.  I learned a lot about an interesting subject and am grateful to the author.<br /><br />As a librarian, I don't advocate the marking of books that are for public use, but I am a firm believer in making one's books one's own -- and you can bet I marked this one up a bit.	2001-10-11

It was what I had hoped Ms. Joan Cornblath's &quot;Beyond the Tower: London for Return  Travellers&quot; would be.<br />This, the second book chronologically in her series of three, was a bit of a letdown after that  stellar beginning, though it is still an enjoyable read if you are missing England and would like to  read some affectionate reminiscences. There is a bit too much about gardens and fauna for my  taste (though in a testament to the principle of &quot;less is more&quot; the anecdotes of the earlier book have inspired me to add some English gardens to my next itinerary). I love forests but don't  necessarily want to read about them in such detail.<br />There is some very good information about various British map series and suggestions for  obtaining them. NB: When reading I had thought the suggestions probably out-of-date, i.e. with the opportunity to buy materials at Amazon.com.uk, but when I checked it out I didn't find  very many maps available online, on Amazon at least. Perhaps that will change, or maybe they are available from the publisher online. I hope so. The editor and author may want to consider adding  this information to a later edition.<br />There is also good information about various options for accommodation, and the author goes a long  way toward demystifying self-catering holiday rentals (reserving a furnished apartment or home).<br />Her observations on souvenir shopping in British grocery stores is charming, and her suggestions  on journal keeping and thumbprint travel are pragmatic.<br />In the third section of the book, &quot;Special Places&quot;, I was not totally pleased with the author's choices of which places to cover. Though I understand that she can only write about where she has actually been, many were very similar to things she had already discussed in the first book.<br />A lot of useful information and a good index.dex.	2001-10-11

Chapters deal with preparing your breasts before the baby is born, dealing with nursing problems including travel, and nursing under a variety of special conditions (a mother with diabetes, premature infants, multiple children, an adopted baby, etc.).  The author, a registered nurse, has organized the book roughly chronologically, categorizing the first two months as a learning period, months two through six as a reward period, and concluding with nursing the older infant and toddler.<br />Appendices are particularly informative.  The first gives contact information for many resources, from support and education to nursing bras, pump rental and various accoutrements such as breast shields and lanolin.  The second gives charts for determining the amount of milk infants of varying weights need.  Appendix three, with its own index, is a gold mine -- a comprehensive overview of all manner of drugs, over-the-counter as well as prescription, with information concerning their safe use (or non-use) while nursing an infant.<br />There is also a bibliography if you'd like to look into certain issues more carefully, and an index which is, as others have stated, rather inadequate.<br />Don't let a poor index stop you from buying this extremely useful resource, though.  If you intend to breastfeed, you will refer to this wonderful book many times -- and you will almost certainly find the answer you are looking for.	2001-10-11

For instance the heroine, Belle Graham, answers the door or the phone *six times* without knowing who is on the phone or at the door and begins to talk and talk and talk, giving away information before she discovers that the caller/visitor is not who she thought it was -- wouldn't somebody learn not to do that after *one* time?  In addition, after receiving threatening phone calls, Belle receives another call immediately afterward so that she can't use star-69.  This happens twice!<br />I thought this was a good idea, but I would not read another mystery by these authors.	2001-10-09

It is colorful, interactive and fun fun fun.  It is one of those gems among children's books that is actually bearable the 500th time you read (or sing) it.  The artistry is exceptional -- clever manipulatives and delightful illustrations help bring this classic song to life.  You will open the doors, swish the windshield wipers, ssshh the babies, and yes, you will make the wheels go round.  Manipulatives are generally lift-the-flap or tab.<br />The material is not very thick, so we also save this book for use with an adult.  We have had to tape the wheels back on though, and have lost functionality on one or two pop-ups.  Nevertheless, this is a delightful book that will bring smiles to your child -- and not drive *you* crazy!	2001-10-02

That's how I feel about this book.  My expectations were so high after reading the reviews here, that I was expecting this to be one of my favorite books of all time.  And although it did not live up to the hype, I still thoroughly enjoyed this engaging book -- I just didn't *love* it.<br />The story takes place in a more innocent time, in a lonely and dilapidated castle in England, where the impoverished Mortmain family lives.  The narrator is the younger daughter of a once-successful author, and one of the sheer joys of this novel is the narrative voice -- it is charming and youthful, and wise yet perplexed in a way that intelligent young people can be -- remarkable since the author was in her 50s when she wrote it!  This was also playwright Dodie Smith's first novel; often a playwright has trouble capturing the natural flow of conversation and description, but Smith accomplishes both here.<br />Another strength is that the author, like Alfred Hitchcock, does not *tell* so much as *show*.  Related as diary entries, and therefore more intimate than straight narrative, illustrative anecdotes immerse the reader in the state of mind of the narrator, Cassandra: we are as confused by her father's peculiar behavior as she is, we do not know whether or not sister Rose really loves her fiancee, we do not know whether or not Stephen would be a desirable beau for our heroine.  Late in the book, Cassandra's father develops a theory that readers create and discover as they read, and Dodie Smith has ensured that we experience this as well as read about it.<br />The Mortmains are complex -- stepmother Topaz is hard-working and kind, if a bit shallow; Rose is dramatic and moody, but also brave.  Other characters, particularly the two American brothers who inherit the castle, are not as three-dimensional, and we are never as interested in them as we are in the English characters.<br />The ending is lovely -- no neat resolution here.  Instead, the reader is left to conjecture about the future of the Mortmain family based on what we know about them, and thanks to the talents of the author, we know a great deal and care enough to wonder.we are in the English characters.<br />The ending is lovely -- no neat resolution here.

Books are organized into book types -- picture books, folk tales, beginning readers, middle readers, and older readers; the latter three categories are further subdivided into genres such as Fiction (Adventure, Historical, Humorous, Sports, etc.), Biographies (Leaders, Artists, Scientists, Sports, etc.) and Nonfiction (History, Nature and Science, etc.), and within each category books are listed alphabetically by author with a paragraph of description, including suggested appropriate age level.<br /><br />Twenty-five pages of introductory text as well as a concluding chapter on Resources for Parents lend further value to this tool, advising parents on where to find books, encouraging your son to read, magazines, and book-related activities.<br /><br />Finally, with this kind of a book the indexes can be particularly valuable. Included here are an author index, a title index, and a category index.<br /><br />If you are choosing books for boys ages 2-14, this resource would be a wonderful help.	2001-09-29

These are organized by book type -- wordless books, predictable/cumulative books, picture reference, picture books, short novels, novels, poetry, and fairy and folk tales. Books within each category are listed alphabetically by title, and one-paragraph descriptions include suggested age level, page count, and reference to other books by the same author. There is also an author/illustrator index.<br /><br />What makes this book unique and invaluable is the reasoned and persuasive text that precedes the book listing. The author is obviously passionate about the issue of reading to kids, and he makes a strong case in support of this belief, pulling together classroom experiences, case studies, headlines and research to form an accessible and compelling narrative.<br /><br />As a parent, a librarian and a former researcher in cognitive and learning science, I was very impressed with the author's command of so many aspects of this issue, and his ability to summarize what is known in an interesting and informative way. We all hear statistics about reading scores, or know a teacher who tells us that student performance has degraded over the years, but in this volume the author has gathered the information from many sources together; furthermore, the author discusses reading in the context of our experience, addressing issues of athlete readers and the influence of television, for instance.<br /><br />As well as answering the question of *why* we should read to our children, there is a terrific chapter on *how* to read and discuss books with children at various ages and stages.  If you want to help your children love reading, this would be an invaluable resource.<br /><br />I give this book my very highest recommendation.	2001-09-29

The organization of the book and the descriptions of each book are generally helpful, though information about age level and number of pages should have been included. Organizing categories in the main listing are vaguely defined (wordless books, picture books, story books, early reading books, middle reading books and young adult books), making the indexes the better access point. These indexes are sufficient to help you find a relevant book. There is: a title list; an author list; an illustrator list; an age appropriate list (which might have based a better organization for the main listing); a read-aloud list; and a subject list of 53 headings, including Adoption, Adventure, Alphabet, Bedtime, Divorce, Horses and Nature.<br /><br />The author renders a valuable service in examining multiple editions of popular books, for example you might find that one particular treatment of the Mother Goose tales is rather musical and illustrated with pen and ink drawings, while another is more colorfully animated and textually simplified for very young readers.<br /><br />Unless you really know children's literature, a book like this is an invaluable tool.  Similar but more directed resources are Great Books for Boys and Great Books for Girls by Kathleen Odean, which is organized into reading levels and then genre, and includes age level but not page count.  Jim Trelease's The Read-Aloud Handbook is a very good, somewhat evangelical, resource organized by genre with age level and page count included in the description.	2001-09-29

The same little rodent is featured, and the illustrations are excellent, but the action almost exclusively concerns the mouse's solitary baking.  It is a short board book meant for the younger crowd and is entertaining, but it is strangely disjointed, particularly when one considers the fluid antics of the earlier books -- a fine introduction to the Numeroff-Bond books, but this one will not have the same staying power.	2001-09-27

All of his books are quiet little masterpieces, and One to Ten Pop-Up Surprises is one of the best.<br />Stark black and white numbers are lifted to reveal colorful frogs and birds, bugs and butterflies, cats, dogs, seashells and even little boys and girls.  Three of the ten manipulatives are tabs, which are more difficult for young children, but any adult would be eager to help out with this beautiful book.<br />Our two-year old eagerly yells out each number and then counts the revealed objects.

What makes this book especially good is that when a flap is lifted, the artists maintain the integrity of the scene.  For example, in the first two-page spread a mother and son are standing beside a pile of luggage.  When you lift the flap to see what is inside the luggage, the top of the flap overlays where the mother and son were withthe same image so that you still see the mother and son as well as the newly exposed luggage contents.  That is such a nice touch, and unique in all the lift-the-flaps I've seen (and I've seen puh-lenty!)<br />Six scenes depict Thomas or his friends at the station, picking up livestock and produce, in farm country, on a bridge, beside the beach, and at the circus.  The pages are glossy so they can be cleaned easily, and the flaps are fairly sturdy, though they can be torn off.	2001-09-10

Finding a category called Environment led to a subcategory of Geology which was 3 pages long -- it took about 30 seconds to find \\"igneous\\".  Looking under Clothing and then right on to the Jackets subcategory, I was able to find \\"Nehru jacket\\" in about ten seconds.  Performing Arts and Broadcasting led to a subcategory of Dance and a sub-subcategory of Ballet which was 2 pages long -- it took only 12 seconds to find \\"plie\\". A category called Words About Words was 8 pages long -- trying to find \\"onomatopoeia\\" here, if you didn't know what letter it started with, was time-consuming; still, it was easier than finding it in a standard dictionary! It was surprisingly easy to find \\"ballast\\", listed under Transportation and located in the short listing under the sub-category Aviation, sub-subcategory Aircraft and sub-sub-subcategory Balloons. Finally, trying to find out about the layers of milk to find \\"cream\\" was unsuccessful. Looking under Animals and then the subcategory Livestock I found only a list of dairy cattle breeds, and looking in the index at the back under \\"dairy\\" and \\"milk\\" I found nothing applicable, though I did look up \\"milk-kneading\\" and \\"milk-teeth\\" when I ran across them just out of curiosity. And that is a positive feature -- that this dictionary, like many good reference tools, allows and even encourages serendipitous forays into its contents.<br /><br />There is a very inclusive alphabetical index at the back, in case you don't know where to begin in an organizational map such as the Contents.<br /><br />This reference tool's flaws are most likely due to the author's interests or weaknesses. For instance, while Sports gets a whopping 70 pages, the Food section is only 8 pages long and divided into four subcategories, one of which is French cooking terms and the other three are about liquor! A science category per se is not present, though human biology can be found under Medicine, some information will be found under Animals, and a fair amount of information is available under Environment, though you would be hard-pressed to find any mention of chemistry or physics here.<br /><br />Another weakness is the absence of pronunciation or usage guides in any but the '1,050 Words and Expressions You Should Know' section. In addition, one is basically limited to nouns. That given, there should be pictures, which would make identification much quicker, particularly in sections like Tools.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very useful resource with some limitations, and I recommend it.e about liquor!

I think he has a wonderful imagination and terrific style, and I particularly like his dialogue -- witty and natural-sounding.<br />I thought these three stories were of mixed quality:  The Woodrow Wilson Dime and Marion's Wall were excellent.  The Woodrow Wilson dime is particularly good, examining the many outcomes possible from simple actions.  But I thought Finney was slightly less successful with The Night People.  His characters were likeable, but ultimately their actions were not believable.<br />That said, though, I would re-emphasize that Finney is a fine writer, and even the weakest novel here is better than many other novelists' work.  And the two stronger novels are highly entertaining.  And what a bargain -- three Finney works in one volume!	2001-09-08

The page is organized into a Materials list, a Process list, and Variations, and includes hints to make the project easier (such as cleanup tips or materials that can be reused).  Icons on each page indicate the suggested age, how much time is needed to prepare ahead of time, whether or not extra assistance may be needed, whether or not caution is required (for sharp, hot or electrical materials), and whether it is one of the author's favorites, based on its being extra fun, extra fascinating, or extra easy and creative.<br /><br />The book would be great if that was all there was to it, but value has been added by the wonderful organization and indexing.  First, the Table of Contents is organized into basic projects (like chalk drawing and watercolors), followed by seasonal projects. And the indexes at the back are great: first, the Project Index lists projects alphabetically; next, a Materials Index lists them by -- materials (so if you want to do something with buttermilk, for example, you can find a project easily); finally, an Art Medium Index categorizes projects by medium -- drawing, painting, clay, sculpture, collage, craft or construction.  These indexes make it terribly easy to find just the right project you're looking for!<br /><br />In the Introduction the author discusses her philosophy of emphasizing process over product in children's art, and gives some advice on how to talk to your children about their projects.

I wish I could demote every five-star rating I've given to a book or a CD or a DVD so that I could give OLIVER WISWELL a unique five-star rating, thus marking its place as one of the best books I've ever read, period. Reading this book was an epiphany. Having an undergraduate history minor, and having taken courses in historiography, I was used to the idea of reading history while keeping in mind that it was written by the victors and by people with their own agendas; but never has that principle been so real, and so vivid, as in the reading of this book. In all my years of school I never learned so much about the Revolutionary War, never cared so much about the war, and never read a book that made me want to visit New Brunswick, Canada.<br /><br />The novel begins in April 1775, when the protagonist is ejected from his home by American rebels, and ends in 1783, when the war has ended and he and other Loyalists leave their home country to establish roots in Canada. In between, the author manages to have Oliver plausibly meeting some of the most interesting characters involved (General Howe, John Vardill, John Cruger, etc) and at the scene of many of the war's most interesting events (the Battle of Bunker (Breed's) Hill, the rebels' surrender of New York, the intrigue-ridden courts of Paris and London, the trek to Kentucky by fleeing Tories along Boone's Wilderness Trail, the siege of Ninety Six and Benedict Arnold's campaign in the south, and the Loyalists' post-war settlement in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Gibralter, Bermuda and the Bahamas). Furthermore, we become involved in the personal lives of several main characters: the young Mr. Wiswell, his resourceful and loyal friend Tom Buell, Sally Leighton -- the rebel girl Oliver leaves behind, and the irascible Mrs. Belcher Byles. In the course of the novel we come to have genuine affection for these characters.<br /><br />I hated for this book to end.

Each letter of the alphabet has a beautiful one-page (and sometimes two-page) illustration with a four-line poem, for example:<br />A is for Acorn<br />&quot;From atop an oak tree/In the Hundred-Acre Wood/A little acorn fell/Right where Pooh Bear stood&quot;<br />with a picture of an acorn bouncing off Pooh's head.  This is a book young children learning their alphabet will love.	2001-08-29

Books	4	14	14	N	N	fun lift-the-flap book with some flap issues	My son loves this book, and what's not to love! There are five large two-page spreads, each featuring a different kind of truck (moving van, fire engine, recycle truck, pickup in a farm setting, and dump trucks at a construction site). Each has about ten flaps to lift. Furthermore, the flaps are a cut above the usual, sometimes showing the same person in a different activity or the same object in a different pose (e.g. the fire engine ladder folded in the original but extended when the flap is lifted), and sometimes accompanied by explanatory text (&quot;The rescue boom is a tall ladder that can reach five or six stories high. It can turn in every direction.&quot;). The pictures are filled with activity and there are enough flaps so that each time you and your child will find something new and interesting to look at.<br />I would give this book five stars if there weren't problems with the flaps. They are perforated but not already separated, and are difficult for a child to open initially. An adult should go through the book first and open them. Also, the flaps are thin cardboard and will tear easily if your child is so inclined.	2001-08-29

The forest itself becomes a defining character in this work which begins in AD 1099 with William the Conqueror's designation of southern England's forest area as a royal hunting grounds and ends in the year 2000 with a reporter exploring the issues involved with recent controversies over the preservation of the area.  In between we come to know several families and their ongoing stories.  One chapter, 'Albion House', seems to be a conscious homage to Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' (with a smattering of Daphne Du Maurier) and is an especially wonderful story.<br />Comparisons to James Michener are valid, and if you enjoy one author's work you will most likely enjoy the other's.	2001-08-20

Mommy, Daddy and child interact cooperatively and in pleasant, fun ways.<br />A little wordy for a 2-year old, but I simplify it a bit as I read, and plan to add more later.	2001-08-14

This book adds to a cherished history of tall tales as Granny goes to valiant efforts to get all the things her grandson Patrick needs in order to get to sleep at her house.  Whenever Patrick tells her he lacks something (bed, pillow, blanket or teddy bear), the resourceful Granny goes to extraordinary lengths to get him what he needs.  (The two-page spread of Granny working with the tree she's cut down, complete with saw, drill, blueprints and paint, is a treat.)<br />It is wonderful to watch your child's sense of humor taking shape.  This book will delight youngsters, will not bore parents, and will introduce little ones to the joy of a good tall tale.	2001-08-11

The storyline, such as it is, unobtrusively follows a young boy and his family through the process -- arriving at the airport in a bus, standing in the ticket line, sitting in the waiting area, boarding the plane and finding your seat, and getting buckled in.  There are also picture showing the crew preparing the airplane, the control tower okaying the plane for takeoff, the pilot and crew in the cockpit, and the jet taking off.  There is a very nice cross-section showing the jet's fuselage, cargo hold, etc.  Each picture is a brightly colored two-page spread, and my two-year old enjoys this book.<br />My quibbles are small.  It would have been nice to see some more children in the pictures; and in one scene we see the little boy buckling up in a window seat on the lefthand side of the plane, but on takeoff we see him look ing out a window on the righthand side.  A small enough mistake, but what if a child notices this and begins to worry that airplanes do not obey the laws of physics or logic?  Will you be prepared to advance explanations that will not confuse?<br />Seriously, it's a nice book that should inform small children, and even help them when they first experience an airport.	2001-08-10

Furthermore, she articulates what many of us feel -- that reading is not just for literary critics and deconstructionists; that there is as much validity in reading for pleasure as in reading for improvement; that there is a delicious paradox in such a solitary activity leading to a sense of community.<br /><br />Through her personal anecdotes, Quindlen relates shared experiences: of having a professor sneer at a book she loved  (I had the same thing happen with Michener -- a wonderful author who has never been taken seriously by the literati); of the first book that made her look at the world in a new way (for me it was The Hobbit); of being the only kid in the neighborhood who'd rather be reading than playing kick-the-can (oh, yes!); of the joy of sharing good books with others.<br />The author includes 11 top-ten lists (e.g. Books That Will Help a Teenager Feel More Human, Books I Would Save in a Fire).<br />Quindlen's work in general, and 'How Reading Changed My Life' in particular, is the stuff at the soul of [...] a joyful community of readers.  As she says, &#34;Reading has always been my home, my sustenance, my great invincible companion&#34;.  There are so many gems; [...], you will probably enjoy this little book.	2001-08-06

The author tells an interesting story (the rescue of a kidnapped girl) within the context of a larger event of interest (Benedict Arnold's march to Quebec), and the narrator is such a likable and knowledgeable protagonist that the reader learns a great deal about the times without even being aware of it.<br />I would say this book could be enjoyed at many age levels.  I intend to give it as a gift to high school-aged relatives, and I will definitely look for more books by this author.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-08-02

These qualities come through in this volume, a combined reissue of two classics from the '70s which have been out-of-print: La Methode and La Technique.<br /><br />After a short section on equipment, there are seven longer sections (with a varying number of techniques): The Basics (70), Shellfish and Fish (33), Vegetables (39), Poultry and Meat (54), Carving (9), Breads (8), Pastry and Dessert (96).  An example of specific techniques covered -- in Poultry and Meat you would find, among others: Trussing Chicken and Other Poultry, Tying a Roast, Kidneys, Cold Parsleyed Ham, Trimming and Cooking Meat, and Cuts of Fillet.  Each technique is several pages long, and is presented as a series of photographs, each accompanied by a sentence or two describing the step being taken.  Directions are clear, pictures (of Jacques's own hands, he assures us) are well selected and illustrative.<br /><br />There are also many fine recipes, including many you may have seen on various television shows in which the author has appeared, such as the beautiful Christmas Yule Log.  You will find basic recipes, like pie shells, as well as more advanced.<br /><br />The volume ends with conversion charts and an index.<br /><br />This is an indispensable resource for the serious cook.	2001-07-28

It came out in 1972, when Hitch was basically the only film director widely known to the public.  In that, as in many things, he was ahead of his time.<br />What makes the book really fun is that it's a compendium of articles by Hitchcock himself and a slew of other writers.  There is his interview with Peter Bogdanovich (from the latter's book of director interviews, 'Who the Devil Made It').  There are articles by Hitchcock on direction in general and about 'Rear Window' in particular.  There are articles about Hitchcock by Andre Sarris and Robin Wood, among others.  And there are nine short articles by various luminaries about specific films and characters, including: James Agee on 'Notorious'; Pauline Kael on '39 Steps', 'Spellbound' and 'Strangers on a Train'; Raymond Chandler on 'Strangers on a Train'; Eric Rohmer on 'The Wrong Man'.  There is a storyboard and shot analysis of the cornfield chase scene from 'North by Northwest'.<br />A very entertaining hash of Hitchcock analysis.	2001-07-25

I guess by that I mean that the author always seems ready to interpret a film as being hostile toward women. I consider myself a feminist, and heaven knows I am no apologist for Hitchcock in his attitude toward, and treatment of, women; but I also refuse to hate or blame men for every ill in the female cosmos. While one could make the case that Hollywood has institutionalized misogyny, and that the strong female roles of the 40s have been replaced to a large extent by roles as prostitutes and crime victims, sometimes the specific conclusions Ms. Modleski reaches are just plain loopy. Other times I think she adds great insight to her observations about the films of one the most talented directors ever.<br /><br />You just have to read the book knowing that the author does have a strong viewpoint and may not always present a balanced perspective.<br /><br />The author examines seven films: Blackmail, Murder!, Rebecca, Notorious, Rear Window, Vertigo and Frenzy.<br /><br />This is a book worth reading, particularly if you are a film (or especially Hitchcock) fan. But you should be aware that this author has an agenda to put forward, and sometimes she doesn't let common sense, or the facts, get in her way. This kind of a book can be very rewarding, but you have to put more effort into the reading of it -- not just reading what the author says, but trying to understand why the author says it. In this sense it is also a good introduction to feminist film theory.	2001-07-24

My son loves balls.  But he does not love this book.  It's boring.  Five two-page spreads (with one flap on each) attempt to recreate an edition of Elmo's World -- talking to Dorothy and a baby etc. -- but the result is kind of a mess.  The text is supposed to be chatty but it is ill-suited to reading aloud.  For example, one spread reads &quot;Let's ask the baby how to catch a ball.  Thank you, Baby!  Watch Elmo catch a ball.  Like this!  Gotcha!  Can you catch a ball?&quot;  The cardboard on the flaps is flimsy and easily bent out of shape.<br />This is not an evil book, but it was disappointing and I don't think we'll get any more of this series.	2001-07-22

This is not a how-to book, rather containing information about how children learn and develop over time.  Chapters include: What Children Learn About People; What Children Learn About Things; What Children Learn About Language; What Scientists Have Learned About Children's Minds; What Scientists Have Learned About Children's Brains.<br /><br />To a small extent the book suffers from the usual dilutory effects of having multiple authors. They also try to be a bit too cute sometimes, but this does not overly detract from the book's success as a layman-friendly introduction to child development research.<br /><br />There is a very useful Notes section, References, and a good Index.<br /><br />My advice, for all it's worth: If you are going to get one book about child development research, get Lise Eliot's 'What's Going On In There?', which is less precious, more extensive, and better organized. If you are going to get two books, add this to your list. I find myself referring back to the former book fairly often, but I do browse through this one occasionally as well.	2001-07-11

Research, supplemented with anecdotes, is divided into chapters based on sense or function and then detailed chronologically within each section.<br /><br />Chapters include: The Basic Biology of Brain Development; How Birth Affects the Brain; The Importance of Touch; The Early World of Smell; Taste, Milk, and the Origins of Food Preference; Wiring Up the Visual Brain; How Hearing Evolves; Motor Milestones; Social-Emotional Growth; The Experience of Memory; Language and the Developing Brain; How Intelligence Grows in the Brain; Nature, Nurture, and Sex Differences in Intellectual Development; How to Raise a Smarter Child.<br /><br />This is one of those books you should write in -- underline, highlight, take notes -- because if you are indeed interested in using this information to understand your child's progressive developmental changes, you will be referring to it often. The author presents a lot of research material in accessible language and style, but the book is dense and is not a day-to-day how-to guide. You will not read about colic or how to tell a cold from the flu, but you will learn why your four-month old prefers a little salt in her mashed potatoes or why most of us can't recall anything that happened before we were three-and-a-half years old. Because there is a lot of information, this is not one of the easiest books you will ever read, but it is eminently worthwhile. The author not only synopsizes a lot of research for us, but also defines the limits of research and/or those issues which are still under debate or not yet fully understood, and discusses the evolutionary implications of various developmental changes.<br /><br />A Notes section details sources so you can follow up in areas in which you're particularly interested.  (With 458 Notes, I'm not sure why one reviewer criticized the book for lack of documentation.) A thorough index.

I should have known better than to buy something with no picture.<br />If you are familiar with the Jellabies, you know they are six soft rainbow-makers made of jelly or jell-o or something similar.  The first problem with this item is that the little stuffed Amber doll is made of no special material to simulate the creatures' special makeup.  Secondly, the doll is permanently attached to the little book.  Thirdly, the Jellabies have very cute little noses, but this doll's nose is a big round plop of a thing, which does not help evoke the character.<br />The book, ten pages and in color, is about Amber's journey (in her signature hot air balloon) to get to Strum's birthday party.<br />The Jellabies are pretty cute, and it is difficult to find tie-in merchandise.  If your child loves these characters and you are desperate for  something, this would be okay, but you'd be better served to get the lift-the-flap book also available.	2001-06-30

There are five two-page spreads and the text indicates that you are, indeed, trying to &quot;figure out where Blue wants to go today&quot;.  You start outside the house, go to the living room, bedroom, kitchen and finally Blue's school.  Along the way you see all of the favorite characters -- Mr. Salt and Mrs. Pepper, Mailbox, Sidetable Drawer, Shovel &amp; Pail, etc.  This is a great book for any child who enjoys Blue and Steve's universe.<br />The flaps are &quot;punched&quot; so they are still held in place by small bits of cardboard -- it might be a good idea for an adult to go through and unhinge the flaps before giving it to a young child or they will grow frustrated and probably bend some of the flaps; also, the flaps are made of thin cardboard, so they will rip off easily if your child tends to indulge in such behavior :-)<br />What is nice about this book is that, similar to the television show, there is some purpose to it.  The design has more intelligence to it than usual.  Plus they're all so sweet!  A winner.	2001-06-30

He is a natural teacher with a flair for beautiful yet simple little masterpieces in the kitchen.<br /><br />This is my first book by Pepin, and those same talents shine through.  Sections are divided into various fruits, and a one to three page introduction to each section gives information about the history, origin and uses for the fruits (including apples, apricots, bananas, berries, cherries, citrus, grapes, dates, mangoes, melons, peaches, pears, pineapples, plums and mixed fruits) as well as Mr. Pepin's personal anecdotes.  There are about 120 recipes and they are generally easy and not too time-consuming.  Simple yet elegant.  Each recipe contains information about yield, preparation time, and calories, protein, carbs, fat, cholesterol and sodium per serving.<br /><br />The recipes I have tried have been well-explained and have come out as planned.  Most, but not all, dishes are shown in color pictures.

There are also sections on lighting and sample garden layouts.<br />Each plant description is several paragraphs long, usually containing a brief history of the plant, sometimes distinctions drawn between species, useful care instructions and often a photograph.

I was somewhat disappointed, though I enjoyed the book and may read more in the series.<br />Some of the characters (Argyll, the series protagonist, and the detectives) are well developed and drawn deeply.  Also, the art history and world of art dealing are interesting and covered well.  The author is gifted in his use of small details which make characters and milieu come alive.  If you have been to Italy, his use of sites and situations (such as the cars squeezed onto a lane barely wide enough for pedestrians) is charming.  However, the suspects are not developed overly well, probably so we do not figure out who the criminal is. Which leads to the other weakness of the book -- the mystery.  It is not very compelling, nor is it particularly well laid out, and so the denoument is neither surprising nor particularly interesting.<br />Since there are not many books (let alone mysteries) set in the world of art, you may want to read this engaging novel, especially if you are an Italophile; but if you are primarily interested in a thriller or an elegant mystery, this is not it.	2001-06-13

And twice there are two-page scenarios (grandpa putting pictures (?) on the VCR and grandma taking off her jogging (!) shoes) where the child is introduced to the activity and then turns the page to experience an interactive aspect to it (turning a wheel to change the pictures -- you know, just like a real VCR! -- and unstrapping the velco on grandma's running shoes, respectively).  For continuity's sake and to facilitate the limited attention span of young children, it would be better if the two pages faced each other.<br /><br />It's nice that the kids visit their grandparents, and that grandma and grandpa are not stereotypes (grandpa bakes, grandma runs!), but if you don't have &#34;Pat the Bunny&#34; and &#34;Pat the Cat&#34;, the best of the series, I would get those first.	2001-06-12

I'm really glad I didn't buy the hardcover. What a disappointment! And for those reviewers who say anyone who doesn't like the book is ignorant of the restaurant business -- No, thank you very much for telling me what I know and think (and what would I like for breakfast today, hmm?) -- perhaps we JUST DON'T LIKE THE BOOK!<br /><br />The stories and language are self-consciously profane, and the writing is generally without merit.  The author is by turns arrogant and whining.  The author despises his customers, calling them (at best) rubes, while all of his employers are imbeciles and all of his employees and co-workers are criminals, drug addicts and degenerates.  Mr. Bourdain is a talented writer.  He can make characters come to life.  But he is a remarkably unsympathetic narrator, and a disorganized thinker: the chapters jump from topic to topic sometimes without any reasoning at all; in the beginning the author tells us that no one should enter the restaurant business, but then he gives a lot of advice on how to enter the restaurant business; he says that everyone in the restaurant business is a loser of one kind or another, but then has a chapter about a couple of exceptionally good chefs.  There is an interesting chapter at the end about a trip the author took to Japan, and a few good pages about tools and ingredients a serious amateur chef might want, but these should have been articles, not a book. There is little organization and no cohesion, and the book could have used a good editor.  *That* is why I do not like this book.  I wanted to like the book.  I just didn't.	2001-06-05

We were going to buy individual books when we noticed this book.  What an amazing collection of Disney stories!  Twenty-three stories, from classics to more recent Disney tales, include: Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Pinocchio, Bambi, Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Lady and the Tramp, 101 Dalmatians, Jungle Book, Aristocats, Mickey's Christmas Carol, Oliver & Company, The Prince and the Pauper, Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Lion King, Pocahontas, Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules, Mickey and the Beanstalk, and Three Little Pigs.<br /><br />Each story is about fourteen pages long, with great pictures from the movies on each page.<br />The book is about 9 inches square, so a bit unwieldy for a child to read sitting, but quite enjoyable if it is spread on a table or held in your lap.  The binding is durable and the pages a bit glossy for easy cleanup.<br /><br />I don't think you can go wrong with this great collection.	2001-06-03

Fortunately, this collection can help.  A parent can substitute this volume for individual books, or can evaluate stories and decide whether or not to purchase a separate copy.  I was disappointed to learn from one reviewer that illustrations were missing from books; I wouldn't have known since I was reading many of these stories for the first time, and can understand the editorial difficulties leading to such a decision, but it is too bad.  The stories range from classic (Madeline, Goodnight Moon, Curious George, Where the Wild Things Are, Stellaluna, Amelia Bedelia, The Story of Ferdinand) to more obscure, and contain works by Marc Brown (an Arthur/D.W. story) and Dr. Seuss.<br /><br />A color key both in the Table of Contents and at the bottom of each page lets you know for what age level each story is most likely appropriate: toddler, preschool, or 5+. At 10 by 11 inches, I would suggest getting the hardover edition, since kids and parents will drop this larger book more often (in addition to normal wear and tear).<br /><br />An introductory Note to Parents is helpful, and the book concludes with Biographical Notes, a Guide to Reading Ages, and an index.<br /><br />This is a remarkable book and our child loves it -- and so do we.  You and your child may very well love it, too!	2001-06-03

Simple text augmented with rebus pictures means that he can participate in reading the book, and he loves that!<br /><br />Silly Willy needs to get dressed but he is, after all, silly. So he puts his pants on his head and his hat on his nose, etc. each time prompting his mother to tell him he looks like some animal, such as a bunny or a duck. It is a sweet, if slight, little story, and Willy and his mom obviously have a happy and friendly relationship. Willy's mom helps him get things right in the end, though Willy asserts that he is still silly.<br /><br />Twenty-four flash cards are fun for children who can point or speak, and primarily contain objects found in the book.<br /><br />The whole series of All Aboard Readers is worthwhile, and Silly Willy is no exception.	2001-06-03

(All Aboard Picture Reader)	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	Interactive, sweet and fun	Our narrator, a girl of 4 or 5, tells us about the new baby at her house.<br /><br /> The first two-page spread is typical of the whole book: a full-page picture on the right shows a mom and dad bringing a baby home where he is greeted by the family pets and his new sister; the left-hand page inserts pictures for many of the simple nouns being used, and reads -- &#34;We have a new (baby) in our (house).  His (hands) are tiny.  His (feet) are tiny.  He is so cute.&#34;<br /><br />The story shows how the baby naps through many everyday noises, though his sister worries about him being disturbed, only to be awakened by a tiny fly buzzing about.  The baby cries.  Neither a bottle nor a bunny comfort him. It turns out he wants to be held by his big sister. She kisses his nose and the baby falls asleep.<br /><br />The story is 21 pages of a few lines each, and is followed by four pages of flash cards (six on each page) which are mainly nouns contained in the story.<br /><br />My two-year-old loves the feeling of participating in the reading, enjoys the funny story, and likes to point or say the flash words. I'd bet your preschooler will enjoy it too!	2001-06-03

Whenever he runs to get books to read, this is in the pile, and usually the first one.  Though he has seen it many times, he still loves to go through the pages -- finding details we missed before, naming objects, imitating sounds.<br /><br />The book begins with a rooster starting the day, followed by a hen and chicks waking up.  From there you will see a baby eating with many objects (labelled) from a meal -- juice, toast, peas, egg, banana, spoon, milk, cereal.  This is a typical page.  To my mind not always very coherent, but colorful illustrations and lots to look at.  Other pages include: Fruit Colors, Kitchen Toys, Shapes, the alphabet, counting, poems, seasons, animals, body parts, facial expressions .... basically, everything you can think of that a small child might be interested in.  The book ends with the hen and chicks going to sleep.<br /><br />I think there is a very good chance your child will love this book, too.	2001-06-03

Her husband is a bit of a dimwit too, which wasn't the case in the other two books.<br /><br />Once Ellie leaves the house, though, encountering the mysterious Mr. Savage and travelling on to the neighborhood pub, immediately the action picks up and Ellie becomes truer to her previous character.  Then it is Dorothy Parker meets Donna Reed, as Ellie gives as good as she gets, and Cannell can keep us smiling with her witty rejoinders.<br /><br /> &#34;He's round the bend, he is!&#34; Jonas bent to pick up the dropped spoon and stood wagging it at me.<br /> &#34;Mr. Savage is a musician,&#34; I reproved, closing the door.<br /> &#34;By gum, you can say that again.&#34;<br /><br />Perhaps Ms. Cannell is such a nice person that she is unable to write believable nastiness.  Whatever the reason, the first half of this book falls flat, but the second half is quite entertaining, including a very sweet scene between Ellie and the mother-in-law of the title as they begin their reconciliation.	2001-05-26

Books	5	11	11	N	Y	Fun, sturdy, colorful	Our toddler loves lift-the-flap books but often, through repetition or curiosity, tears the flaps off; however, the flaps on this book are thick and sturdy, and have withstood many viewings with no tears.  The heavy laminate pages clean up easily.<br />The book is colorful and has a LOT of flaps:  the first two-page scene features the first ten numbers; the second has the 26 letters of the alphabet; the third shows a farm scene with nine colors featured; the fourth is a busy circus, with flaps for eight shapes; the fifth is a beach scene and the flaps depict seven pairs of opposites; and the sixth shows a fairy tale scene that incorporates eleven flaps hiding characters from the show (Stella, Baby Bop) and fairy tale characters (Humpty Dumpty, Mother Goose).<br />A good value, entertaining and educational.	2001-05-20

It is frequently the one he chooses to have read to him, perhaps because each page is interactive.<br /><br />One, of course, must pat the cat.  Then you can extract money from the ATM and later put it into daddy's wallet.  You can imitate mommy making a list, scratch and sniff the gingersnaps, help Neddy and Martha see-saw and play peek-a-boo, and squeeze the little bear before going to bed.<br /><br />It is a fun, quiet little book that your child will enjoy.  And you will too -- not because it's exciting, but because the time you and your child spend looking through it will be happy and peaceful.	2001-05-17

I disagree completely with the reviewer who said that the four narrative voices are too similar and also those who decry the ending. One of the things that I found remarkable as I read was the author's skill at evoking an almost subliminal exposition of each individual narrator, writ small and large ... habits of thinking, perspective, priority ... these changed with each voice in believable ways. As far as the ending -- it is the ending as seen by Anthony Wood, who is as fallible as the other three narrators. To the extent that this ruins the book for a reader, it is perhaps an indication that they have not learned the lesson of the book -- that words and deeds are open to interpretation, even by those involved. Besides, even if we accept Wood's account as true, when one reads, it should be with an open mind tolerant to all possibility -- otherwise why not limit your reading to account ledgers? Does the non-existence of Oz detract from Baum's creation? It needn't. Does Orwell's &#34;1984&#34; frighten us less because such events had not occurred? It shouldn't.<br /><br />This would be a great e-book, since many exchanges between characters are later depicted differently by another narrator, and the process of trying to find the scene again in another part of the book would be easier if one could use a search function.<br /><br />The author sustains momentum throughout, layering meticulous detail with exciting exposition and revealing, through human stories and in all its complexity, the Reformation -- one of the most dramatic times in England's history.<br /><br />Obviously, as evidenced by the reviews, not everyone has loved this book.  While I think detractors are wrong :-) what is important, particularly when undertaking a volume of this length, is some prediction of whether or not *you* will like it. I would suggest that if you are interested in history (particularly English) or historiography, if you want to immerse yourself in a challenging but rewarding story, if your mind is not lazy or of the fault-finding variety, and if you are fascinated by human psychology, there is a good chance you will enjoy it very much.<br /><br />Take a chance.

Toth's affectionate reminiscences	Ms. Toth is at it again -- making one long for a visit to the isle of book shops and tea rooms, great theatre and lovely gardens. This, the third volume in the series, has particularly good information on theatre-going, museums, and London transport.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the book, I do have some reservations about recommending it.  Again there is a heavy emphasis on gardens, with a LOT of specific information about what flower species are present and where they're located in various gardens. I think the author writes very well on literary landscapes and I would like to have had more than one short chapter. I do wish the author and her husband would branch out a bit -- in the three books of the series they visit many of the same areas many times over -- Cornwall in particular -- but totally neglect others. My only other complaint, and it sounds silly, is that Ms. Toth seems a bit of a ninny in this book, though she was very charming in the other two volumes: she intrudes, rather rudely I thought, on a priest teaching a class; she does not know that European VHS tapes do not work in U.S. machines; she is several times 'unsettled' by images which turn out to be statues or sculptures; she is a bit more condescending toward people who don't share her philosophy of travel.<br /><br />While the author gives valuable contact information for various agencies, I do hope that future editions will include online resources as well.<br /><br />If you love England, and especially if you love English gardens, this book will delight you.  While not as charming as the author's first book about visiting Great Britain, My Love Affair with England, it is still loaded with good information and fun anecdotes.<br /><br />No index.	2001-04-28

Surely anyone who has heard two people relate entirely different versions of a recent event must understand that tales from several thousand years ago cannot be taken literally. Then again, people send money to Pat Robertson, so perhaps I shouldn't be puzzled. To predicate one's enjoyment of this work on how well the story fits with biblical accounts is to view this novel too narrowly. The fundamentalist faction in these reviews is as geeky as the nerds who can't enjoy Star Trek novels unless they get a plausible explanation of how the transporter would handle a person sneezing. Relax. Enjoy a finely crafted work of fiction.<br /><br />In any event, whether one believes in the Bible as a literary-historical document or as a divinely inspired revelation, the author has found a flawless narrative voice to relate the events surrounding Jacob and his four wives.  Indeed, she handles even issues of the female protagonist's unusual access to events so skillfully that one never questions her veracity.<br /><br />The novel works on many levels. Not only is it a great story, but it made me think about the past (and my connection to those who came before me and those who will come after) in a new way. It also made me appreciate with more immediacy the tragic loss of women's voices in our historical documents.  Is anyone else tired of history as a list of wars and powerful figures? Here is a new way of seeing the world, and no one could argue that this woman's life was boring or trivial.  The author is insightful about family relationships, articulating the deepest feelings of children and parents, lovers and friends, as her protagonist grows from a child in the camp of Laban to a midwife in Egypt.<br /><br />I look forward to reading this book again, as I know I will, and sharing it with others.	2001-04-19

The latter are only marginally interesting, but the interview was very nice.<br />I really enjoyed this book.  Too often novels emphasize a gimmick rather than the story but while this novel used the device of going backwards in time, the content justified doing so, and it enhanced the impact.

Having had several Brits recommend Bill Bryson books the last time I was in Britain, I was disappointed that he was rather whine-y and not all that funny. Susan Allen Toth, however, is a kindred spirit. I enjoyed reminiscing based on our shared experiences (the love of English footpaths, and Britain's lovely breakfasts and teas) and look forward to my next trip and trying some of the things I had not experienced before, such as omelettes and gardens.<br /><br />I have travelled to other places and enjoyed them very much, but there is something special about England. This author has a gift for articulating those special qualities. I found myself smiling often as I read these pages and drinking more tea than usual. I would say that this book would be more enjoyable for someone who has already been to England rather than someone who is trying to plan their first visit there.<br /><br />I can't wait to get back to the U.K. -- or to read Ms. Toth's next book -- and I would like the people of Britian to read this book and see that *this*, rather than Bryson's, vision is the one I carry for their lovely isle.	2001-03-28

I want believable plots, an interesting story, strong characters and a good mystery, and found all of these within the pages of this fine novel.  This was a wonderful, fun read with a satisfying ending.<br />The cover states that this book ws named one of the century's 100 favorite mysteries by the Independent Mystery Bookseller's Association, and it does deserve such an accolade.  The only thing that could have improved it would have been some recipes!	2001-03-28

The protagonist, Mildred Lathbury, is also our narrator -- a woman who is, generally speaking, at peace with her spinsterhood.  She is a thirtyish single woman of good works, but she is also surprisingly funny.  Sometimes she is downright canny regarding those people with whom she deals; at other times she seems to be endearingly dim.<br />I really enjoyed this book, my first by Barbara Pym, and will look for more by this author.	2001-03-25

There has been a murder, and she is trying to help her brother-in-law Bill solve the crime so he can get a promotion to detective. This is the premise of Joanne Fluke's first Swensen mystery, and it is an enjoyable read.<br /><br />The mystery is average and the amateur sleuth is sometimes slow to figure things out. Sometimes the internal chatter gets a bit silly and distracting, but in general this is a likable character. More problematic is the large cast of characters; it's difficult to get to know anyone well when so many are introduced.  Most annoying is brother-in-law Bill. I'm not sure, other than familial loyalty, why anyone would sleep better knowing that Bill is a detective. He is rarely confident or competent, repeatedly asking Hannah what he should do next or what information means.<br /><br />The cookie recipes included are quite good, and I would read another mystery by this author, but I would wait to buy it in paperback.	2001-03-25

I started the book several times and, confronting these weaknesses, put it down again. But I always wound up going back because the subject is so interesting, and did eventually finish the book.<br /><br />Having acknowledged the faults, though, I must say that I learned a lot reading this book, which is filled with interesting anecdotes as well as respectful nods to the many people who contributed to the development of our present-day calendar.  The author does a good job of balancing specific information with the big picture, and one learns quite a bit about the history of Europe and the Catholic Church (and other areas and institutions to a lesser extent).<br /><br />There is a good index.	2001-03-22

In addition, the typographical errors are annoying.<br />On the positive side, the book has an interesting premise and the author an enjoyable style.<br />This would be a good book for a juvenile who is showing an interest in longer works but may not yet be ready for something the length of a novel.	2001-03-16

It is a charming portrait of a bygone era, and yet it captures those things which are eternal -- the love of learning, the power of human feeling, and the irresistible bond of kindred spirits.	2001-03-13

His characters are quickly three dimensional, the dialogue is realistic, and the mystery is genuinely puzzling.  The protagonist is a homicide detective on the Denver Police Department -- at least for a while -- and is immediately sympathetic and complex.<br />I thought the ending was a bit jumbled, but eventually all strings are tied up.  This is a worthwhile read, and should be particularly interesting to book aficionados  or those familiar with Denver.	2001-03-12

Words are taken primarily from the Romance languages -- French, Italian and Spanish -- but also from Chinese, Japanese, Navajo, Sanskrit, Bantu and at least a dozen others.<br /><br />There is an interesting introduction, a bibliography and an index.<br /><br />In the introduction the author mentions that he culled these samples from a list of hundreds; this might be an instance where an accompanying web site giving all of the words considered might be a lot of fun and very useful.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2001-03-11

Being the story of the relationship between one William Minor, a doctor and convicted lunatic suffering from paranoia, and James Murray, editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, there is much more right with the book than wrong, but it does have some problems, primarily the lack of an index. Any book with so many names should have an index.<br /><br />Secondly, one wishes to see and hear more -- the author refers to several interesting photographs: a formal farewell photo of Minor near the end of his life, returning to America after 37 years in England (all but one spent in Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane); the last photo of Murray, a fortnight before his death, in the Scriptorium (where the OED was compiled) surrounded by his daughters and staff.  It would have been nice to see these pictures. The author refers several times to Minor's handwriting and many times to his letters. It would have added to the story to see at least a few letters in full, and particularly to have seen a sample of Minor's writing. In addition, Winchester credits the motivation for the creation of the OED to an address by Richard Trench, in which Trench delineates seven ways that dictionaries of the time were deficient, but then states that &#34;most of them are technical and should not concern us here&#34;!  I think people interested in this book *would* most likely be interested in these technical details.  If nothing else, they should be put in a (foot)note.<br /><br />Finally, although the tale is generally well told and an enjoyable read, the author occasionally hits a false note which a reader may find jarring; for instance, in describing Minor's post-trial delivery to the asylum, Winchester states that &#34;the horses were sweating slightly as they hauled the four-wheel vehicle and its occupants up the low sandstone hill at the top of which stands Broadmoor itself.&#34; Oh really. Nice touch of drama, but disconcerting when so much else is related without imaginary flourishes. Similarly, Winchester conjectures that a hypothetical event may have led to Minor's autopeotomy, though there is no reason at all to believe such an event occurred.<br /><br />Having listed these flaws, one is obligated also to acknowledge the author's successes. In addition to an engaging style in service to an interesting tale, there is a charming author's note, an acknowledgments section actually worth reading, and a touching dedication (fleshed out in the text) to G.M. -- George Merrett, Minor's murder victim, who left behind a pregnant wife with seven children and who rests in an unmarked grave.<br /><br />I recommend the book.

Then there is an individual map (with main streets identified only) for the individual tours: The City, Dickens's London, A Historic Pub Walk, Westminster & Whitehall, St. James's, The East End, Clerkenwell, Bloomsbury, Soho, Chelsea and Hampstead.<br /><br />I purchased several walking books of London before my most recent visit there and found this one the most useful; I walked six of these tours and thought each was worthwhile and enjoyable.<br />Phone numbers and hours are listed for businesses and museums along your route.  Each tour begins with a two to three page introduction and has a paragraph or two about each site listed, usually 20-30 places.  The introduction also gives information about the best and worst times to try the walk, the closest tube stations to the beginning and end of the walk,  and the approximate amount of time the walk requires.  The book ends with general information about London, including transportation, a list of recommended reading, and a very good index.<br /><br />An excellent value.	2001-02-21

While it covers many areas often neglected in tour books of Great Britain, it does not give the detailed information which distinguishes a truly invaluable guide.<br /><br />Twenty walks are included, though some are in the same location: Bath (2), Cambridge (2), Canterbury, Chichester, Church Stretton, Dorchester, Hay-on-Wye, Knole, Oxford (2), St. David's and Solva, Salisbury, Stow-on-the-Wold, Tenby, Wells, and York (2).<br /><br />Each walk is covered in eight to ten pages including a one or two page map (labelled with main thoroughfares only).  The tours lead one to enchanting sites and draw one's attention to architectural and historical points of interest, but the narrative is minimal and so may detract from one's enjoyment of a place.  No information is given about the approximate length of a walk or transport to and from the walk, nor niceties such as refreshments available along the way, but museums are listed with times (not phone numbers).  There is  good index.<br /><br />I would rate this book three-and-a-half stars but that is not possible.  I will round up to four because I think that the spirit of this book is not to document every step of your way, but rather to help you enjoy the underdiscovered path; in that it succeeds, and would make a lovely supplement to a more traditional tour book.	2001-02-21

I was vaguely disappointed.  Though I would not say this book was a total waste, neither did I use it very much on my next trip.<br /><br />The book has a chatty, friendly syle but it is not very substantive, which is frustrating because one has the feeling that Ms. Cornblath knows more than she is letting on.  It is rather as if you are getting advice from a knowledgeable friend who is rushing out the door.<br /><br />Some establishments are recommended but hours and phone numbers are not given.  A good index.<br /><br />I would use this book as a supplement.  It might perhaps even serve as a preamble to your trip, using it to establish an itinerary.

What does make this book charming is that one can imagine walking with Mr. Curley, hearing him recite the literary passages presented here and seeing the sites discussed; indeed, one need not depend solely on imagination since there are a generous number of (black-and-white) photographs included.  A very good map of the area is included.<br />But the book fails as either a ramble or a tour guide.  If it is a ramble, let there be more narrative; if it is a guidebook, then let there be more information.<br />Taking the walk with Mr. Curley is undoubtedly a wonderful experience.  Unfortunately this book does not capture that experience.	2001-02-21

If you are at all curious about why things happen when you cook or bake, you will be delighted with this magnificent work.<br /><br />Mr. McGee is a fine writer who makes the science understandable and the lore entertaining.<br />At nearly 700 pages, the book contains a good index, a bibliography and about 200 illustrations; it is organized into three parts: foods, food and the body, and the principles of cooking.	2001-02-18

For example, the Jane Austen chapter contains two trails, one in the area of Steventon, Hampshire, Jane's home her first 25 years, and another in Bath, a resort frequented by the Austen family and used to varying extent in all Austen's novels except &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34;.<br /><br />Published by the National Trust, this book contains a gazetteer, bibliography, list of plates and a good index.  Authors discussed include Austen, Tennyson, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Hardy, Woolf, du Maurier, and Sayers.  Sixteen trails are presented.<br /><br />I have only two complaints about this book -- well, one complaint and one wish.  The organization of the book is not intuitive and it is not apparent which literary figures are discussed.  To some extent this is due to the constraint of having to organize by geography rather than, say, chronology, and one can always turn to the index; but while some chapters are obvious (Jane Austen in her Landscape, Thomas Hardy's Wessex) others leave one to guess (Muses and Mountains?  The Scene of the Crime?) and because the index is generous one cannot tell if a person is really discussed or just mentioned.  In addition, it would be nice to have a map of England that shows all of the trails so that one might see the geographic relation of these literary souls.<br /><br />My wish reveals my enjoyment of this book, flaws and all -- I want MORE -- more maps, more photographs and pictures, more authors covered.<br /><br />Well done, and certainly a fine addition to the collection of anyone who loves British literature.	2001-02-18

Mr. Waldstein is a bargain-hunting angel.  This book is well-organized and a fun read, though sometimes directions are sketchy and hours of operation or phone numbers are wrong.  It is less like having access to a city's reference librarian than meeting a friendly person who's lived in the city for years and knows all the best places though not always the details.<br />This was the first book of the Mr. Cheap series and is now in a second edition.  Organized into four main sections (shopping, entertainment, restaurants and lodging), reviews are informal and newsy, usually around 100 words.

Peas, peas and yet more peas -- it sounds like a great way to visually present the idea of exponential growth in mathematics.  The execution of this idea, however, is only moderately successful.<br />This is only my opinion and may not be true for all readers, but I found the presentation inhibited rather than clarified the concept.  Sometimes two pictures were on the same page and the graphics were very busy -- many characters, inserts and dialogue balloons detracted from the impact of seeing a growing pile of peas.  Perhaps you remember the film &quot;Powers of Ten&quot; that showed a couple picnicking and then distanced the camera from them exponentially; that film was elegant and evocative.  This was pretty messy.  As I said, though, this is my opinion and kids may love it.	2001-02-17

The first half of the book is definitely more anecdotal than analytic, and would be of interest primarily to those who want to know about the great reporters, editors and newspapers of the last few decades.  The book becomes more interesting, in my opinion, in the second half.  Here Mr. Germond does relate his opinions and experiences with a variety of political figures to good effect.

Isabella Stewart Gardner was a fascinating woman, and Shand-Tucci brings insight to her story, but the style is so intrusive as to be distracting.<br /><br />Mrs. Jack, a New Yorker transplanted to Boston by marriage and alienated from the Brahmins by character, was often generous but not always kind. She acted as mentor and patron to outcasts of the time -- homosexuals, Jews, artists and (to  a lesser extent) women -- but she was also quick to reject those she considered beneath her interest. She built Fenway Court, a truly unique and visionary museum, for the people of Boston; but she would also have her carriage park on the sidewalk in inclement weather even though many pedestrians were inconvenienced.<br /><br />Furthermore, the enigmatic Mrs. Gardner destroyed many of her letters and papers shortly before her death, so the fact that Shand-Tucci's insightful speculations about her seem plausible is no small feat.  That is why it is particularly tragic (perhaps too strong a word, but close) that the reader can never forget the presence of this heavy-handed narrator. Here is a sample sentence (page 158):<br /><br />&#34;Though stimulated by her patronage-Gardner was one of the first to see Loeffler not only as a virtuoso but as the composer he wished to be and increasingly today is regarded as-Loeffler grew to feel at one point distinctly imposed upon by Gardner, who seemed to him possessive and only too willing to &#34;show him off&#34; in Ralph Locke's words, as &#34;a kind of in-house virtuoso&#34; in the Gardner music room, all of this, or (sic) course, quite classic behavior on the part of humble but artful, trustworthy but vain, kind but cruel and rampagingly dominant Isabella!&#34;<br /><br />One can open the book to almost any page, as I did with this example, and find sentences as bad or worse. The jacket states that the author won an award for a previous book, but that is difficult to imagine.  It is almost unreadable, and I put the book down twice before I finally finished reading it.<br /><br />On the other hand, it did make me want to revisit Fenway Court (now the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum) in Boston. The content is great but the style is almost insurmountable.before I finally finished reading it.

On a cold winter day I saw a policewoman directing traffic and speculated about the clothes she must be wearing to keep herself warm.&#34;<br /><br />First, why should I trust this author to teach me to see things anew when he hasn't noticed a beautiful tree he passes frequently? Secondly, while the premise of the book rests on the idea of enriching one's visual appreciation, the author's decriptions are consistently impoverished. I would hope that the author would proceed to tell me what it is that makes the tree branches graceful -- paint a verbal picture and teach me how to look at the tree. Or tell me how to approach a painting, to see it from afar and then approach it -- what do I look for that makes it special and beautiful.<br /><br />This never happens; instead it is a series of personal anecdotes that rarely probe very deeply.<br />Pictures are interesting, some in color, but again they are not used to accomplish what the title promises.<br /><br />A disappointment unless one is interested in the author rather than the subject of the title.	2001-02-16

While Michener's novel is incredibly wonderful, this audio book does not do it justice.  Having read the book shortly before I bought the audiocassette so that my family could listen while on a driving vacation, I know that there are horrific gaps in the plotlines.  This might be excusable, considering the length of the novel, but the taping quality is very bad.  There are many distracting gaps, often as if it was edited in mid-sentence.  At one point in the middle, another narrator even takes over for a sizable reading before Peter Graves returns!<br />This is by far the worst audio book I have ever heard.	2001-02-15

This book, however, has  answered every one of my questions -- even the rather odd ones,  like why  the milk was green.  The index is adequate but not comprehensive, so while  it may take some searching to find the information you seek, the  information is there and is expressed clearly.  Well worth the price.	2000-02-21
