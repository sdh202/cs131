I have seen in countless critiques of my own work, for example, that recalling historical facts will only rekindle the hatreds of the past. Of course, the opposite is true: recalling the past, and the facts of history, is an important, indeed, critical antidote to hatreds, as they offer the only sure way of avoiding the errors of bygone eras.<br /><br />If we refuse to acknowledge those errors, we are consigned to repeating them. And today, with so much emphasis placed on the importance of relative \\"narratives\\" and so little emphasis placed on facts, knowledge itself--and all the libraries that secure it--stands highly at risk.<br /><br />This book is a fantastic and much needed treatment for the disease of relativism. Not only does it offer myriad details on the various schools of thought that have brought us to the current desperate pass, but it contains a stunning set of historical facts as well.<br /><br />One learns for example a bit about the Aztecs' conquest by Cortes, the mutiny on the HMS Bounty in 1789, French deconstructionist Michel Focault, and the end of the cold war in 1989. Windschuttle uses those pieces of data to illustrate his points.<br /><br />Today one risk one runs \\"in defending anything traditional is to be seen simply as a knee-jerk reactionary,\\" he writes, \\"a middle aged academic defending the remnants of his own intellectual capital\\" while holding the fort against younger ideologues. But that reaction is a dead letter, as the vast majority of professors pushing \\"the new humanities\\" have entered their forties or fifties, and many of the Continental gurus that floated these history-bashing ideas are \\"already dead.\\"<br /><br />No, the truth and history are at stake. Windschuttle makes a great case for studying the \\"old-fashioned\\" facts. Let us hope that a majority in the professoriate soon see the light of his wisdom.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

For that reason, some might assume that the little pig on the cover of Robert Spencer's bestselling new Guide is meant to insult the faith.<br /><br />They would be wrong. Regnery has trademarked the term Politically Incorrect Guide, along with the little pig, and has posted this insignia on two other books, Politically Incorrect Guide to American History and Politically Incorrect Guide to Science, the latter due this fall.<br /><br />The series does intend to be humorous, however. Also on the cover is quotation from an Islamic chat room. A poster wrote of Spencer: \\"May Allah rip out his spine from his back and split his brains in two, and then put them both back, and then do it over and over again. Amen.\\" Not funny, but he jovially tags this \\"--'praise' for the author on RevivingIslam.com.\\"<br />These lighthearted touches, before one even opens a book on a deadly serious subject, foreshadow many more quips inside. A few examples:<br /><br />* After Muhayissa murdered K'ab, he was rebuked for the deed by his brother Huwayissa, who was not yet a Muslim. Muhayissa, unrepentant, told his brother, \\"Had  the one who ordered me to kill him ordered me to kill you I would have cut off your head.\\" Huwayissa replied, \\"By God, a religion which can bring you to this is marvelous!\\" And he became Muslim. \\"The world is still witnessing such miracles today.\\"<br /><br />* \\"Polygamy...is moving westward with Islam. In late 2004, polygamy had become so common among Muslims in Britain that the British were considering recognizing it for tax purposes.\\"<br /><br />* \\"Lying: It's wrong-except when it isn't.\\"<br /><br />Other funny tidbits are the small boxes in each chapter entitled \\"A book you're not supposed to read.\\" These recommendations include such scholarly works by Joseph Schacht; Bat Ye'or; and Raphael Israeli; as well as ancient and modern Islamic texts like the Qur'an, Umdat al-Salik, or Reliance of the Traveller: A Classic Manual of Islamic Sacred Law, translated by Noah Ha Min Keller and Milestones by Sayyid Qutb.<br /><br />But despite the humor, the 231-page text is a somber discussion of Islam for laymen, and the scholarship at its base is impressive. The book includes 21 pages of footnotes, the vast majority of which cite Muslim sources.<br /><br />Spencer attacks the notion, head on, that the Qur'an teaches tolerance and peace, for example, by citing the Qur'an itself.<br /><br />\\"Say: O disbelievers! I worship not that which ye worship; nor worship ye that which I worship. And I shall not worship that which ye worship. Nor will ye worship that which I worship. Unto you your religion and unto me my religion\\"(Qur'an 109:1-6).<br /><br />This would be well and good, Spencer adds, if the Qur'an stopped there. But it doesn't. While Muslims are instructed that there is no compulsion in religion --- and to \\"begin not hostilities. Lo! Allah loveth not aggressors\\" --- once hostilities have begun,<br /><br />\\"Muslims should wage them furiously: 'And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter'.\\"<br /><br />It is not a fair assumption, either, that Spencer takes anything out of context. Very often, he adds context to quotations often seen in the public media.<br /><br />Take the often-quoted Qur'an 5:32: \\"Whosoever killeth a human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind, and those who saveth the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind.\\" This, writes Spencer, is not what it might seem. It is addressed to the \\"Children of Israel,\\" for starters, not to Muslims, and it is in the past tense. It is actually a warning to Jews not to make war against Mohammed. (Qur'an 5:31-33)<br /><br />The three-part book is divided into eighteen chapters, part one dealing with Islam and its early spread by the sword, part two covering the Crusades and the various current myths surrounding this history, and part three reporting on the current global jihad war. It is not intended to be a general introduction to the Islamic religion or a comprehensive survey of the Crusades, according to Spencer, but \\"an examination of certain highly tendentious assertions about both Islam and the Crusades that have entered the popular discourse.\\"<br /><br />Concerning the Crusades in particular, the book comes to some remarkable conclusions. The Crusades were not called, according to Spencer, to rape pillage and burn, but on the contrary to defend the Christian world. \\"The conquest of Jerusalem in 638,\\" he writes, \\"stood at the beginning of centuries of Muslim aggression, and Christians in the Holy Land faced an escalating spiral of persecution.\\"<br /><br />Early in the 8th century, 60 Christian pilgrims from Amorium were crucified; in the same era Caesarea's Muslim governor seized some Iconium pilgrims and executed them all as spies-excepting the small handful that converted to Islam. Christians were forbidden to teach religion to others-including their own children. In the 9th century Christians fled Holy Land persecutions in large numbers. Churches were destroyed, monks slaughtered and so on. The year 1004 began a decade long persecution in which 30,000 churches were destroyed and Jews were similarly accosted. Thus in 1095 Pope Urban II called the First Crusade to regain previously Christian lands.<br /><br />Furthermore, Spencer contends that the Crusades were actually successful. The Crusades \\"bought Europe time-time that might have meant the difference between her demise and dhimmitude and her rise and return to glory.\\"<br /><br />As for today, Spencer warns that the jihad of the seventh century is still alive and well. One proof is the similarity of the quotations of an 11th century jihadist compared with that of our contemporaries. Another is in the longing for a revival of the caliphate---in America. Another is the inability to criticize Islam without being attacked.<br /><br />This book relies heavily on Muslim scholars. Everyone should read it.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

For Islam, at its core, seems to be a faith bent upon the conquest and subjugation of non-Muslims.<br /><br />In part two, Bostom collects many jihadist teachings in the Qur'an, for example, Qur'an chapter 9, verse 29, \\"Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the last day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and his apostle, nor acknowledge the religion of truth even if they are the people of the book, until they pay the  Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.\\" These teachings fill all of two pages in the text.<br /><br />But Bostom does not stop there. The third chapter is devoted to classical and modern teachings of Qur'anic commentators on Chapter 9, verse 29. Al-Suyuti (d. 1505 CE), for example, writes \\"Fight those who don't believe in God nor in the Last Day [Unless they believe in the Prophet God bless him and grant him peace] nor hold what is forbidden that which God and His emissary have forbidden [e.g. Wine] nor embrace the true faith [which is firm and abrogates other faiths, i.e., the Islamic religion] from among [for distinguishing] those who were given the Book [i.e., the Jews and Christians] until they give the head-tax [i.e., the annual taxes imposed on them] (l'an yadinl) humbly submissive, and obedient to Islam's rule.\\"<br /><br />Also commenting on the Qur'anic chapter 9, verse 29 are al-Zamakshari (d. 1144), al Tabari (d. 923), al-Beidawi (d. 1286), Ibn Kathir (d. 1373), Sayyid Qutb (d. 1966) and al-Azhar, al-Muntakhab Fii Tafsir al-Qur'aan al-Kariim, 1985. Let no one say that Bostom has taken these teachings out of context, for the classical and contemporary commentators interpret the passage in precisely the same way as it appears.<br /><br />Chapter 4 is then devoted to jihad in the Hadith, with commentary from Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim.<br /><br />Part 3 presents the classical writings of Muslim theologians and jurists on  jihad. This 110-page section spans the entire history of Islam, beginning with commentators from the 8th century and continuing through the 20th century. Bostom has gleaned writings of Malik B. Anas (d. 795) from the Muwata, as well as a 1915 Ottoman Fatwa.<br /><br />He also includes several works translated into English for the first time. For example, Ibn Qudama (d. 1223), writes, \\"Legal war (jihad) is an obligatory social duty (fard-kifaya); when one group of Muslims guarantees that it is being carried out in a satisfactory manner, the others are exempted.\\" Almost everywhere in this text, the author is belligerent. \\"It is permitted to surprise the infidels under cover of night, to bombard them with mangonels [an engine that hurls missiles] and to attack them without declaring battle (du'a).\\"<br /><br />Similarly, the renowned Sufi master al-Ghazali (d. 1111) writes (now in English for the first time),\\"One must go on jihad (i.e. Warlike razzias or raids) at least once a year... one may use a catapult against them [non-Muslims] when they are in a fortress, even if among them are women and children. One may set fire to them and drown them.\\" The marriages of slaves, al-Ghazali continues, are automatically \\"revoked. One may cut down their trees.... One must destroy their useless books.\\" This belies the notion that Sufism is peaceful.<br /><br />Al-Hilli (d. 1277) appears for the first time in English on the traditions concerning the tax on certain infidels, who have not been enslaved or murdered. And the Persian scholar Muhammad al-Amili (d. 1621) has been translated from Farsi concerning Jihad holy war: \\"Islamic holy war against followers of other religions, such as Jews, is required unless they convert to Islam or pay the poll tax.\\"<br /><br />The 117-page Part 4 includes overviews of Jihad by important 20th century scholars, including Edmond Fagnan, on jihad according to the Malikite school, Roger Arnaldez on the holy war according to Ibn Hazm of Cordova, Clement Huart on the law of war, Nicolas P. Agnides, on the classification of persons under Islamic law and John Ralph Willis on the jihad ideology of enslavement.<br /><br />As Ibn Warraq notes in the forward to this monumental study of Islamic jurisprudence and prosecution of war, Dr. Bostom (a non-specialist from the field of clinical medicine) is the first scholar to have had translated from Arabic into English the works of al-Bayadawi, al-Suyuti, al-Zamakhshari and al-Tabari, as well as works by Sufi master al-Ghazali, Shiites al-Hilli and al-Amili. He also includes representatives from the four schools of Sunni jurisprudence-Averroes and Ibn Khaldun (Maliki), Ibn Taymiya and Ibn Qudama (Hanbali), Shaybani (Hanafi), and al-Mawardi (Shaafi).<br /><br />Ibn Warraq continues: Some contend that Dr. Bostom is right to expose history hitherto denied, but this was not the right historical moment to do so. But, as Isaiah Berlin once noted, from the ideologue's willingness to suppress what he suspects to be true has flowed much evil.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

He describes the war as brutal and without mercy.<br /><br />For example, when Muslims captured the city of Bahnasa, the invaders slew the commander of the Byzantine troops and all his companions, but also \\"put to the sword all that surrendered, and spared none, whether old men, babes or women.\\" Their innumerable acts of violence caused wide panic.<br /><br />The fall of Alexandria and Egypt resulted primarily from the weakness of Patriarch Kyros (and prefect of Alexandria), and the Coptic refusal to surrender and submit to Islam. A panic \\"fell of all the cities of Egypt and all their inhabitants took flight.\\" The multitude of Copts, horrified by the slaughter witnessed in Alexandria, prepared for battle against the Muslims and viewed the Islamic conquest as \\"heavier than the yoke which had been laid on Israel by Pharaoh.\\"<br /><br />The Arabs, for their part, after the jihad conquest of Egypt, followed the pattern displayed against Christian and Jewish populations in Syro-Palestine. Towards the Orthodox Christians, their attitude was settled by the state of relations between the caliphate and Constantinople. Tolerance in peace turned to violent outbursts during hostilities, resulting in the death of many Christians and the manifold destruction of churches.<br /><br />By the time the Muslims arrived in Nikiu, on the Nile near Damanhur, there was not a single soldier to resist them. \\"They seized the town and slaughtered everyone they met in the street and in the churches-men, women and children, sparing nobody. Then they went to other places, pillaged and killed all the inhabitants they found. In the town of Sa they caught unawares Esqutaos and his men, of the tribe of Theodore the general, who were hidden in the vineyards, and they slew them.\\"<br /><br />Here, John left off, for he wrote, \\"it is impossible to describe the horrors the Muslims committed... on Sunday the eighteenth day of the month of Guenbot, in the fifteenth year of the lunar cycle, as well as the terrible scenes which took place in Cesarea in Palestine.\\"<br /><br />From Tripolitania, then known as Pentapolis, Amr b. al-'As sent the  inhabitants, and did not allow them to stay there. \\"He took considerable booty and a large number of prisoners....

Nine months later, his action was filed in London-where British laws make libel especially difficult to disprove.<br /><br />Ehrenfeld's offense? Her book reports that bin Mahfouz, the former chairman of Saudi Arabia's largest bank, National Commercial Bank, had allegedly deposited \\"tens of millions of dollars in London and New York directly into terrorist accounts-the accounts of the same terrorists who were implicated in the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, in which 224 people were killed, including twelve  Americans, and more than four thousand were injured.\\"<br /><br />The book implicated bin Mahfouz in transferring from the bank's Zakat (charity) Committee some $74 million to the International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO) and to the Muwafaq \\"blessed relief\\" Foundation. Muwafaq in turn allegedly deposited funds directly with al Qaeda. Finally, Ehrenfeld also indicated that much of the funding for terrorism emanates from the Saudis, and from the bin Mahfouz and al Rahji families, who allegedly funnel the monies through a host of \\"charitable\\" institutions.<br /><br />The reporter based her account of bin Mahfouz' alleged miscreance on a variety of reports from reputable journals and magazines, lawsuits, government documents, and data from public and anonymous government officials, among other sources. Although he denies any connection with terrorists, bin Mahfouz is among the targets of 10 lawsuits by the families of the September 11 victims, seeking damages of more than $1 trillion.<br /><br />In Rachel Ehrenfeld v. Khalid Salim a bin Mahfouz, the author responded by seeking a declaratory judgment that her assailant could not prevail against her in the U.S. on libel charges arising from her 2003 book, Funding Evil. The case was assigned to Manhattan Federal Judge Richard Casey, who is also handling the bulk of the 9/11 lawsuits.<br /><br />Ehrenfeld's attorney, Daniel Kornstein, considers her suit as important as New York Times v. Sullivan-the 1964 case in which the courts decided for the first time \\"the extent to which the constitutional protections for speech and press limit a State's power to award damages in a libel action brought by a public official...\\"<br /><br />In the U.S., where Ehrenfeld lives and works (and her book was published) her allegations seem reasonable and should therefore be free speech protected by the First Amendment. Undeterred by U.S. law, however, the sheik reportedly sent emissaries at all hours to threaten Ehrenfeld. \\"You had better respond,\\" his agent told her on March 3, 2005, in delivering some documents from the British action. \\"Sheik bin Mahfouz is a very important person and you ought to take very good care of yourself.\\"<br /><br />In Britain, libel laws place the burden on the defendant. Law courts require a reporter to prove the truth of his or her written allegations. In her defense, she must call to testify original sources--including government officials both public and anonymous. Given the impossibility of getting former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (among others) on the stand, Ehrenfeld chose not to respond in Britain at all. Consequently, she lost the British case by default in May.<br /><br />Bin Mahfouz is no stranger to U.S. courts of criminal law. In 1992, for example, he paid $225 million (including a $37 million fine) to escape criminal charges in New York involving his role as chief operating officer of the shuttered Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Its New York and London branches were closed, and BCCI was implicated by the Central Intelligence Agency for laundering drug money and supporting international terrorists. In settling, Bin Mahfouz admitted no wrongdoing.<br/><br />Nevertheless, in October 2001, according to former national security advisor Richard Clarke, the U.S. Treasury Department listed Yasin al Qadi as a designated terrorist for his financial support of al Qaeda. Qadi headed Muwafaq, a Saudi \\"relief organization\\" that Clarke said \\"reportedly transferred at least $3 million, on behalf of Khalid bin Mahfouz, to  Usama bin Laden [sic] and assisted al Qida [sic] fighters in Bosnia.\\" So testified Clarke before the Senate banking committee on Oct. 22, 2003.<br /><br />\\"Sullivan established the modern ground rules of libel actions and they have been in place since 1964,\\" says Kornstein. Those standards, very friendly to reporters and writers, have put the onus of proof on libel plaintiffs. In this case, 23 copies of a book published in America were picked up in a foreign jurisdiction, which was used to seek judgment against an American. \\"The question is,\\" Kornstein concludes, \\"do the Times Sullivan rules mean anything in a world so dependent on the Internet, instantaneous communication and international process that did not exist in 1964.\\" Do they carry the same weight they were meant to carry 40 years ago?<br /><br />Among those supporting Ehrenfeld in an amici filing with the U.S. District Court in New York are Amazon.com and the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Her legal expenses are expected to top $300,000--although she has to date received no financial backing from the publishing industry. According to the friends of the plaintiff,<br /><br />\\"Rarely in the history of the United States have the principles underlying our First Amendment - the need for vigorous, open debate, particularly of matters of such vital public concern as the book at issue here - been more important. The energy, drive and credibility of our investigative journalists and book authors are critical to understanding and coping with international terrorism and other threats to our society.

But in 1955, barely 17 years after the dictator's death, a little-known pogrom, driven primarily by Islamic fanaticism, targeted the Greek population of Istanbul, with the intent of driving non-Muslims from Turkey.<br /><br />Modern Turkey inherited religious discrimination against non-Muslims from the Ottomans. According to Speros Vryonis Jr.'s landmark new study, the September 1955 government-orchestrated pogrom against the Greek Orthodox community \\"included the systematic destruction of the majority of its churches,\\" monasteries and cemeteries. He shows that riots which destroyed 4,500 Greek homes, 3,500 businesses, 90 religious institutions and 36 schools in 45 distinct communities, resulted not only from \\"fervid chauvinism, or even [from] the economic resentment of many impoverished rioters, but [from] the profound religious fanaticism in many segments of Turkish society.\\"<br /><br />Actually, discrimination against the Greek, Jewish and Armenian populations of Turkey began much earlier, during the First World War. \\"The attitude towards the minorities was not something new in 1955,\\" Vryonis says today. \\"It had a long tradition that was inherited from the Young Turks [who] took over as the Ottoman Empire was faltering....\\"<br /><br />In the 1930s, Ataturk developed racist theories that all history and languages flow from Turkish history and language. Ever since, the Turkish state has \\"believed that there should be one language, one nation, one culture, one religion,\\" says Vryonis. Kemalism effectively established the \\"Turkification of Gobineau's theory of the racial, and therefore civilizational, superiority of the Aryans.\\"<br /><br />These theories are still taught in Turkish schools-and founded the basis for discriminatory laws passed against Greeks and other non-Muslims during the 1930s and later.<br /><br />In 1932, for example, nine years after the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, Turkey violated the treaty with impunity, imposing a series of 31 crippling laws to reduce Greek political, legal, economic and cultural strength. Some 10,000 Greek citizens were deprived of their livelihoods as tailors, merchants, photographers, carpenters, doormen, lawyers, doctors and realtors and forced to emigrate, penniless, to Greece.<br /><br />In 1941 and 1942, the government began the mass deportation of minority men aged 18 to 38. The forced labor battalions of the so-called 20 generations of Jews, Greeks and Armenians were meant never again to see the light of day. Then in 1942, the government established the varlik vergesi, a capital tax so onerous as to impose financial ruin on the community.<br /><br />The tax was set at confiscatory rates --- Greek Orthodox at 156 percent of annual income, Jewish at 179 percent, and Armenian at 232 percent, compared to the 4.96 percent annual income tax suffered by Muslim Turks --- and applied to everyone, including minority bell hopes and taxi drivers. At least one newspaper spoke of \\"liquidation\\" of the minority mentality and their populations, by inducing them to leave Turkey.<br /><br />These provisions strongly resemble the ruinous jizya (poll) and kharaj (land) taxes imposed on legions of earlier generations of non-Muslim dhimmis. The varlik vergesi also deprived the community of its wealth, imposing severe penalties if Greek and other non-Muslim citizens did not pay within fifteen days of its promulgation. Massive numbers of minority properties and businesses were ultimately transferred to Muslim hands, much as khalifs in earlier eras had expropriated them, forcing non-Muslims often to convert to Islam to survive.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, between 1924 and 1934, Turkey's Greek population fell by two thirds, from nearly 300,000 to 111,200, according to Vryonis. By 1955, the number ofGreeks had dropped another 24 percent, to 85,000.<br /><br />In 1954, Cyprus became entwined with the fate of 's Greek minority. Months after Turkish foreign minister Mehmet Fuat Koprulu declared that his government had no interest whatever in the outcome of a Greek plea to the international community for Cypriot independence, at British prompting, Prime Minister Menderes ousted Koprulu, installed foreign minister Fatin Rustu Zorlu instead, and turned a 180 degree about-face. The armed campaign against Turks by the Greek National Organization of Cypriot Fighters elicited howls of indignation from the Turkish press, which joined the battle cry of the Cyprus is Turkish Association, known as KTC for its Turkish acronym.<br /><br />Eventually, attention shifted from the Greek Cypriots to the Greeks of Istanbul and the government organized the roughly 100,000 necessary students, labor unionists and other rioters and transported them to Istanbul to destroy, within nine hours, the homes and businesses of 85,000 Greeks scattered through 45 hilly square kilometers in areas hard to access from one another. The pogromists came equipped with lists of Greek addresses to target, though the Armenian and Jewish communities were also hit. Armenians lost 1,000 stores, 150 homes, three churches and four schools, while Jewish residents lost 500 shops, 25 homes, and suffered damage to one synagogue.<br /><br />The 1955 pogrom came in three well-organized waves, says Vryonis.<br /><br />The first wave destroyed metal doors and barriers to all churches, houses and businesses. The second wave commenced pilfering. Those with foresight came with trucks to systematically loot and transport booty. The third came some time later to finish off the marauding.<br /><br />British and American officials attributed the pogrom to two factors: \\"simultaneous self-erupted nationalist and economic motivations.\\" The third factor --- the genuine underlying cause, Vryonis notes --- was religious fanaticism. Pogromists came well-equipped with pickaxes, shovels, wooden timbers to serve as battering rams, acetylene torches, gasoline, dynamite and large trucks full of stones. The security people, secret police, municipal police and armed services were everywhere.<br /><br />Government involvement was exposed in the 1960 and 1961 trials at Yassiada. Contemporary reports (which the book provides) also describe government assistance to pogromists as organizers shouted \\"Cleanse the fatherland of the infidel!\\" and \\"We do not want infidels' merchandise in our country.\\" Official vehicles  transported the pogromists.<br /><br />Today, only 1,800 Greeks remain in Turkey --- mostly in Istanbul, according to Vryonis --- and property rights remain a legal concern.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

The moral relativism that has been applied to so much of western life--I'm okay, you're okay--has come to rest in politics as well.<br /><br />Eidelberg takes on the dangers of this state of mind with a case in point--the state of Israel, where acceptance of negotiations with the Palestinian Liberation Organization in 1994 accelerated the process of political relativity.<br /><br />The book is not simply a political analysis. There is much logic and philosophy herein as well. For example, Eidelberg discusses the notion of symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships, as put forward by the psychologist and philosopher Ignacio Matte-Blanco.<br /><br />The mind subliminally tends to view everything as symmetrical, he writes. If John is the brother of Peter, it also holds that Peter is the brother of John. But this view of the world and relationships breaks down when one applies it to parents. It is clearly not true that, if John is the father of Peter then Peter is the father of John. But in the logic of the unconscious this is normal. Eidelberg then proceeds to explain why these ideas are important in every democracy, using Israel as the example.<br /><br />If moral relativism were merely an academic doctrine that predisposes democracies to semantic subversion, Eidelberg writes, its philosophical refutation might mitigate the ill effects. But the principals of equality and freedom--the cornerstones of democracy-- &#8220;lend themselves to relativism, hence to semantic subversion.&#8221;<br /><br />Equality pervades every aspect of democratic life, shaping the minds of the educated and uneducated alike, and prompting them to apply the ideology to all domains, including moral values or opinions on how man ought to live. Equality also reinforces the principal of freedom, which nowadays generally translates to living as you like, according to Eidelberg. &#8220;The absence of ethical or conceptual constraints on self-actualization and self-determination cannot but eventuate in mental disorders and political anarchy.&#8221;<br /><br />This is a fascinating political study, with a great deal of value. Its conclusion leaves something to be desired, but the discussion en route is most enlightening.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Iron was dug and forged. Men armed with iron entered Britain from the Continent and killed the men of bronze....\\" The author notes that as technology has rapidly advanced, the very life on the planet has become endangered by \\"the shattering lethality of present day weapons.\\"<br /><br />While the \\"sun has set\\" on the intercontinental ballistic missile, with their numbers drastically reduced in the 1990s, Tsiddon-Chatto argues convincingly that the worries for the west are far from over. Mu'ammar Qadahfi in 1991 stated that if Libya had possessed missiles in 1986 when the U.S. attacked Tripoli and Benghazi in 1986, \\"we would have launched them against London, Washington and New York.\\" Indeed, Libya fired two scuds (which fell short) at Italy's island of Lampedusa.<br /><br />The Middle East has ballistic missiles, and chemical and biological weapons while nuclear weapons are \\"maturing.\\" Since this book was published in 1999, those statements are more true. But even at that time, nations including Syria, Libya, Yemen, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, some with help from China and North Korea, owned missiles with payloads of 190 to 2,150 kilograms and ranges of 70 kilometers to 2,800 kilometers.<br /><br />Even Israel could not then match the maximums of these other Middle Eastern nations. In other words, missiles launched from Iran could threaten Europe. Furthermore, the benefit from U.S. efforts to achieve delays in the proliferation of missiles in the Middle East \\"has expired long ago.\\" This requires Israel, obligated \\"by its territorial straightjacket...to accept the 'worst case' possibility as a determinant in the definition of its deterrence/war waging capabilities.\\"<br /><br />The book, further, discusses the development of the Arrow system of defense, designed to destroy attacking missiles when they are close to their targets. This useful commentary is followed by three cogent essays on a) the missile threat against Israel, b) missiles and defense of Israel, and c) the chemical and biological threat to Israel. As the last of this series notes, the threats emanate not only from Iraq, but also from Egypt, Syria Libya, and Iran. With or without treaties of peace, as Tsiddon-Chatto previously observed, there will be a war the moment Arab and Muslim nations perceive Israel to have weakened significantly enough for them to prevail.<br /><br />Next Gerald Steinberg investigates the failure of U.S. Missile Control Technology Regime initiated in 1987 \\"to stem the proliferation of ballistic and cruise missiles and technology to areas of instability.\\" The Middle East is not the only problem region, however. Moreover, the U.S. has also failed to enforce sanctions against suppliers such as Russia and China. The remaining essays are equally informative, and even include some philosophical points.<br /><br />While this book may be of interest primarily to military personnel, it provides in total an alarming eye-opener on the threats that still exist in our post-Cold War era.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

A former park ranger, Lupita and her husband Jon now lead private tours through the Canyon and are included among those profiled in this fine 109-page documentary of the Navajo way of life.<br /><br />That way is a slower way, one that stops to greet the sun rising in the east, and puts in the time to paint in detail with grains of sand or threads in a woven blanket. A photograph of one such portrait is included with dozens of images of people and places in the Canyon. The portrait painted in a carpet is indistinguishable from the man portrayed.<br /><br />The book explains some of the pre-requisites of life within the Navajo Nation, from the border towns of Flagstaff, Arizona and Gallup, New Mexico to the interior. It also details the history of the reservation, establishment of missions and schools in the 1910s, 20s and 30s, and the 1933 livestock reduction program that brought wealth to a few and poverty to many.<br /><br />But it also delves deeply into the Canyon de Chelly microcosm, which is a community and family unto itself. Readers learn of ceremonies, both serious and light-hearted, as they are performed by the people who live here. The Kinaalda, for example, the puberty ceremony for young women, requires them to rise before the dawn on the second of four days and run into the sunlight. By the last day, the women are ushered into womanhood.<br /><br />Of course, there are problems in the Canyon, chief among them the lack of employment opportunities. One of these is provided, of course, by the tourist industry. But that alone cannot absorb enough workers to accommodate a population of more than 150,000.<br /><br />At Tsaile, at the eastern end of the Canyon, Navajo Community College gives young men and women higher education, while promoting them into the world of professionals. But until these youths advance, the book notes, the older generation has been left to \\"flounder between two worlds.\\"<br /><br />For those who wish to learn the trials and joys of Navajo life, this book is an excellent place to start.

For the government dissolved, several times over, and the Jewish people were swallowed.<br /><br />The book opens with a brief history of the Jewish people in Ukraine, which surprisingly, goes back 1,000 years. Some 32 pages are devoted to it, before turning to the key events covered in the study. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Jewish population of Ukraine were composed of some 1.9 million souls, who made up more than 8 percent of the Ukrainian population of 23 million.<br /><br />While the Jewish people kept to themselves, and their life in Eastern Europe revolved around the Sabbath and the execution of 613 commandments, respect was alloted to all non-Jews who were required under Jewish law to adhere only to seven basic commandments in order to receive a place in the afterlife.<br /><br />Despite the dissimilarities, there were also many similarities between the cultures, whose cross-cultural exchanges occurred mainly through women.<br /><br />The next several chapters, the bulk of the monograph, cover the establishment of Jewish autonomy in 1917, how this autonomy worked in practice (not well), the pogroms of 1919, and the failure in 1919 of Jewish autonomy and support for the Ukrainian directorate.<br /><br />The fall of the tsar marked an attempt by Ukrainians and Jews to establish a noble experiment in human rights, Abramson writes, \\"but despite good will on both sides, the experiment was a disastrous failure.\\"<br /><br />Even before the pogroms of 1919, there was violence against the Jewish people. The autonomy was marred by nearly 120 attacks on Jewish villages and people in 1917 and 1918. In 1919, the number of attacks totaled more nearly 1,200.<br /><br />Thousands of Jewish lives were lost as a result, and it was no small wonder that the Jewish people of the Ukraine in the wake of this violence turned to the Red Army as their salvation. Irony, too, for the Red Army ended up as much an enemy of the Jewish people as any tsarist regime or the Ukrainian directorate.<br /><br />The book contains many maps of the Ukraine and Pale of Settlement during this period, along with illustrations of important government personages, charts and graphs and the occasional political poster.<br /><br />This is an excellent study for anyone interested in the microcosm of Ukrainian Jewish life during revolutionary times.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Not only did one have to suffer a seven-year commitment to servitude, but one had to suffer overt anti-Semitism--the kind that swept villages and left hundreds dead in their wake.<br /><br />Thus it is understandable that a key figure in this non-fiction tale--Israel Abramson, the author's father--chose to pull out some teeth and sever the tendons of several toes to avoid the dreaded service. He came to the little shtetle of Talne in Ukraine to manage Boris Petrofsky's drugstore after Boris was drafted. There in the Pale of Settlement--the area to which Russian Jews were confined from 1794 to 1917--he met Manya Polevois and her family.<br /><br />It was the fall of 1917, six months after Czar Nicholas had been ousted and replaced by the Socialist provisional government. Socialist Alexander Kerensky and Prince Lvov were running Russia's World War I effort, which was going badly. The Russians were losing, and young boys were ruthlessly drafted and sent to the front without training or experience to die.<br /><br />In October, Lenin returned to Russia, and in November, Ukraine's parliament refused to turn over power to the Bolshviks, establishing instead the Ukrainian National Republic. For the first time in their history, Ukraine's Jews were promised a measure of freedom, but instead, pogroms followed.<br /><br />In March 1918, Russia and Germany signed the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, in which Russia conceded Ukraine to the Germans. Israel, fearful of pogroms, came running to the Polevois family for assurance. Just then the German officers walked in and commandeered the Polevois home. They remained until November, 1918, when Germany conceded Ukraine to Russia and the forces of Simon Petlura.

It includes many midrashim, or stories, detailing the lessons of the Jewish rabbis of old, several of which are incorporated into the Passover seder. This introduction explains how these midrashim came to be in the service.<br /><br />In addition to the Hebrew text on the right-hand pages, with English on the facing left, the book contains the music for the most important blessings and songs of the holiday. There are also lovely engravings.<br /><br />The main section of the book, some 81 pages, is of course devoted to the Passover service itself--the meal and all its rituals, from the blessing over the wine, washing of hands and dipping of greens to the final favorite Passover songs.<br /><br />The book is dated, but for those looking for a straightforward explanation and service for the Passover holiday, one could do<br /><br />much worse.	2005-07-14

Before that, the Iraqi constitution promulgated in 1925 had granted, in Article 6, equal rights to all before the law, regardless of religion, nationality or language.<br /><br />Nevertheless, in response to a demand by the (Nestorian Christian) Assyrians for autonomy, the army conducted a massacre in August 1933. This, as Moshe Gat observes in this all-encompassing study, was an ominous sign for the Jewish community, and indeed, much worse for the Jewish people of Iraq was soon to follow. Indeed, the declarations of King Faisal, who died in 1933, were somewhat meaningless, and in any case, were followed by the nationalistic attitude of his young anti-British, anti-Zionist son Ghazi.<br /><br />Roughly 120,000 Jews lived in Iraq, (the census of 1920 listed 87,000, the census of 1947, 118,000), making up some 3 percent of the overall population, most of them in the major cities of Baghdad, Basra and Mosul. They were shortly to suffer the oppression spearheaded by nationalistic forces, whose leaders included the British-appointed Jerusalem Mufti, Hajj Amin el-Husseini.<br /><br />The Mufti arrived in Iraq in 1939 and his hatred made no distinction between Zionist and non-Zionist Jews. At the same time, anti-Jewish Nazi propaganda began to infiltrate Iraq, at the instigation of Fritz Grobba, the charge d'affairs at the German Consulate from October 1932, who purchased a major daily newspaper. Nazi propaganda penetrated deeply into the society also thanks to the pre-existing predilection to Jew-hatred in the Islamic society at large.<br /><br />This led to the October 1941 farhud, or pogrom, in which 180 Jews were murdered in the course of two days--including women, children and the elderly--and several hundred others were severely injured. Property damage amounted to several hundred thousand pounds sterling.<br /><br />At that point, the Jewish community awakened to the fact that living peaceably among Muslims was not in the cards. But flight was not yet possible en masse. Only a few thousand Jews managed to escape to India, Britain and Iran. Almost none went to Israel, where they considered it folly to go.<br /><br />Riots occurred again in January 1948, reflecting deep hostility to the regime, and 300 to 400 people were killed or injured. That May, riots targeting the Jewish community were feared. The government instituted martial law, primarily to protect itself from the expected fallout from such a development.<br /><br />Eventually, all 120,000 Iraqi Jews fled the country. Contrary to rumors and historical myths, this exodus was not resultant from Jewish terrorism (which did not occur), but from the anti-Jewish policies of the Iraqi government and people.<br /><br />All together this is a fine read, which dispels the myth once and for all.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

The book assumes that separatism was entirely economic, rather than religious and political, and mistakenly supposes that the British actually supported Zionism, when quite the opposite is true.<br /><br />Beginning in 1929, for example, the British enforced Islamic law concerning Jewish prayer at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, thereby prohibiting Jewish worshipers from approaching the sacred wall within 10 feet, and from sitting there. Furthermore, the British actually instigated Arab riots against Jews, and prohibited Jewish communities from defending themselves.<br /><br />Furthermore, while the book rightly acknowledges Arab attacks on Jewish communities in 1929, it fails to note that such attacks actually began more than 20 years earlier, and therefore preceded by a substantial margin any &#34;economic&#34; development cited herein.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

But Paul Murphy, who uses that term in his preface, gets it. The jihad is not about land or politics, but about obtaining perpetual Islamic rule and law worldwide. Chechens like to compare their national character to the wolf, because it will attack a stronger foe, and they do it in the name of Islam.<br /><br />Had Russia recognized Chechnya after the first recent war ended in 1996, moreover, the process of perpetual jihad would merely have been hastened, he adds, since Chechnya's president could not control the criminal gangs who sought to take Russian territory in Dagestan \\"to carve out their new Islamic state in the North Caucasus.<br /><br />The principal character in this drama is Shamil Basayev, a Sufi Naqshbandi Islamist, heir to a deputy of the Imam Shamil who fought Russia in the 19th century Murid Wars, from 1830 to 1859. Credited to his name (if you can call it that) are the 1995 attack on a Russian hospital, and his famous 1991 hijacking of a Russian airliner and his 1996 Grozny offensive. He has a $5 million price on his head, but even this has not stopped the Sufi terrorist, who is a favorite with foreign journalists.<br /><br />Basayev seeks to reestablish the imamate, which he envisions to encompass Dagestan, Ingushetia, North Ossetia and Karachaevo-Cherkessia, ultimately stretching from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea, a vision supported by Chechen president Dzokhar Dudayev, who took office illegally on November 2 1991--a month before the USSR was dissolved.<br /><br />On November 9, 1991, Basayev went with Said-Ali Satuyev and Lom-Ali Chachayev to the Russian town of Mineralnye Vody, where they hijacked a plane with 178 passengers to Turkey. They threatened to explode the aircraft and all its passengers if Russia did not lift the state of emergency imposed on Chechnya.<br /><br />In Georgia, in July 1992, the Grozny Confederation of Caucasus Mountain People Parliament sent troops to fight for the independence of Abkhazia; it is a documented fact that the veins of captured Georgian soldiers were cut open and the victims made to toast the Chechnyan victors with their own blood. Worse, 100 Georgian soldiers were herded into a central stadium and beheaded; their heads were used as footballs in a soccer match.<br /><br />Basayev lost 56 men in the Abkhaz Battalion. But when he returned to Chechnya in February 1994, he had created a combat ready force to serve President Dudayev. Then Basayev and 20 men went to Afghanistan to train in the Amir Muawia camp (which U.S. cruise missiles hit in August 1998 in an attempt to kill bin Laden).<br /><br />In June 1993, Basayev stormed the town hall in Grozny to disrupt a protest of Dudayev's string of undemocratic actions, and disbanded demonstrations in Tealtralnaya Square, killing at least 30 people. The attacks on the opposition continued in 1994, and Basayev took a key role in defending Dudayev against Russian-backed forces and 47 Russian tanks. Basayev attacked with rocket propelled grenades and took 21 Russian soldiers hostage.<br /><br />During the first Chechen war, from 1994 through 1996, Basayev's forces rose in number to at least 2,000--some say 10,000. In December 1994, Russia sent 24,000 troops into Grozny to disarm \\"illegal armed formations and restore constitutional order.\\" Chechen forces opened fire with a huge arsenal of grenade launchers, flamethrowers and a modified warhead that could blow the top of any tank with one hit. They destroyed the entire Russian brigade, killing about 1,000 Russian troops.<br /><br />The Chechen atrocities were horrific. In one case, a Russian soldier was nailed to a cross and mutilated there. His own penis was cut off and stuffed in his mouth. It took Russia until early 1995 to control the last stronghold of resistance, in the village of Shatoi.<br /><br />These terrorist exploits were followed by a gargantuan suicide mission in the summer of 1995.On a budget of $35,000, Basayev purchased trucks and a car to transport terrorists to Russia and pay bribes at the border. In Budennovsk, his men shot every policeman in sight at the local police station, raised the Chechen flag over city hall, killed 41 townspeople and captured the local hospital, where hundreds of hostages were imprisoned. To garner a press conference, he murdered five hostages. Sixteen days after the siege began, 143 hostages were dead and 415 people wounded--and Russia had been compelled to call a cease fire in Chechnya. In all there had been 1,600 victims.<br /><br />And this was just the beginning for Basayev, a man Murphy calls Russia's Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />In all, the 280-page book catalogs the gruesome details of more than 240 terror attacks with thousands of victims.<br /><br />The one fault with this volume is that Murphy ascribes all the evil to the influence of the Wahabbi sect. But Basayev and his followers are all Naqshbandi Sufis, and they are following a jihad tradition that is 1,400 years old, inscribed in the theological and legal doctrines of all major branches of the faith, as attested in Andrew Bostom's [[ASIN:1591023076 The Legacy of Jihad]].<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

That is to say, it does not allow there is such a thing as an Arab civilization. There are Greek and Latin civilizations, the author avows, but everything that was ever great amongst the Arab Moslems \\"owes nothing to the Arabs nor even to Islam. Nations converted to Mahometanism only made progress because they belonged to other races than the Arab, and because they had not yet received too deeply the impress of Islam. Their effort was accomplished in spite of the Arabs, and in spite of the Islamic dogma.\\"<br /><br />The author then proceeds to prove that every piece of knowledge ascribed to Arab Moslems throughout the great golden age of Islam in fact derived from the nations that Islam had conquered.<br /><br />The book begins with the time of Mohammed and moves forward through Arab and Moslem history, citing ancient and modern sources alike to prove its rather solid and seemingly incontestable points. Even Arabic numbers, and algebra, ascribed so often to Arab genius, were products of the conquest of the Hindu Kush (a phrase which actually means Hindu slaughter.)<br /><br />Were this book written today, it is doubtful that it could find a publisher. All the more reason to read it.<br /><br />And lest anyone ascribe racism to the author, I would remind readers that Islam is not a race; it is a religious ideology whose adherants contain a vast collection of races and tribes, the globe over.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

One, by Zeev Rubin, covers Judaism and Rahmanite monotheism in  the fifth century. But most of the articles focus on the modern period, namely the last two centuries.<br /><br />One of the best essays in the lot, by the editor, concerns the 19th century treatment of Jews in Morocco. In November 1863, British foreign officer Sir John Drummond was informed that Sir Moses Montefiore would proceed to Morocco to petition the Sultan to grant absolute equality to non-Muslims, Jews and Christians alike, throughout his dominions. The British Consul in Tangiers, Thomas Reade, was well aware that such a demand \\"flew in the face of Islamic law and, as he put it, was opposed to \\"the religious and deeply rooted prejudices of a fanatical people.\\" In response, the Sultan issued a \\"fine sounding dahir, which was nothing more than a statement of the status quo ante: namely the traditional position of the Jews under Islam as a protected people.\\"<br /><br />The Jewish people of Morocco were soon aware that Sir Montefiore's visit had accomplished nothing: Jews forced to work on the Sabbath warned that any effort to contradict this order could cost them their lives.<br /><br />The foreign office had hoped to dismantle the dhimma, the laws under which non-Muslims were subjugated as abject people, but Drummond Hay knew perfectly well that there was no hope of abolishing that code in Morocco.<br /><br />In the decades following the dahir, many appeals were made to the British government regarding their safety. One case concerned a certain Jew called Benaim, whose throat was slit for his donkey. \\"The frequency of these atrocities perpetrated on the persons of unoffending Israelites in Morocco has produced great consternation throughout that community,\\" said a memorandum to the Marquis of Salisbury in 1880. The dahir of 1864 had said that non-Mussulman subjects of Morocco should enjoy perfect equality before the law--but witness of a Jew was not accepted by the country's legal tribunals, thereby proving how flagrantly justice was denied to them. The memo continued, \\"Moorish officials act towards the Jews especially in the interior in an arbitrary and insolent manner and ...the populace treat them with contempt and not infrequently indulge in brutal attacks upon them.\\"<br /><br />Consciousness of these great evils led to the establishment of consular protection; its effectiveness and necessity was proved by the numerous legitimate occasions when consular protection was invoked, both to protect local Jewish inhabitants and travelers from distant lands. After Drummond Hay retired in 1885, in February 1888, a group of British merchants and bankers again brought up the safety and lack of equality of Moroccan non-Muslims. But a committee of Jewish people demanded the abolition of the dhimma. Stressing the \\"oppressed condition of the 300,000 Jewish inhabitants of Morocco,\\" who \\"suffer from the violence and injustice of the native authorities,\\" they wanted action that would relieve the Jewish people of Morocco of their degraded position. The list of disabilities affecting Jews numbered at least 27. Jews were forced, for example, to pay a capitation tax, and could not plead a legal case against a Moor. They could also not drink from public fountains. And so on. The committee's plaints fell on deaf ears. Thus in October 1891, two Jews were killed by tribesmen, who were ordered to pay the families (in traditional Islamic practice), and in November 1892, cruelty was again noted by Lord Roseberry.<br /><br />While the publisher's description of this book denies the mistreatment of Jews under Islam, the essays rather prove otherwise.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Ultimately, the book is about human rights, and supports them for all people.<br /><br />Lord Moyne (or the Right Honorable Walter Edward Guinness, first Baron Moyne) served as British Minister of State in the Middle East, and as such represented the government that until 1944 so oppressed the Jewish people in their internationally declared homeland. In 1922, 1929 and 1936, when Arab riots erupted and Jewish families were slaughtered unmercifully and carved to pieces, the British government reacted by arresting all Jewish men found to own a firearm for use in self defense and sentencing the victims to 7 years of imprisonment.<br /><br />Moyne's own personal record was nothing to be proud of: \\"My dear fellow, whatever would I do with a million Jews?\\" he had asked Joel Brand, a Hungarian Jew who upon his capture claimed that Hitler had agreed to release that many Jews from death camps upon receipt of 10,000 trucks and quantities of tea, coffee, soap and other goods. He had certainly done nothing, moreover, to aid the escape of Jews from Nazi Europe to their internationally mandated home in Palestine.<br /><br />It was for those reasons, among others, that Itzhak Yizernitsky (Shamir) and Israel Sheib, aka Sambation, had determined many months before the deed that Moyne was to pay with his life for his and British crimes against the Jewish people. They had chosen to commit the murder two young Zionists, Eliyahu Hakim and Eliyahu Bet Zouri, men from Tel Aviv and Haifa who had witnessed first hand the Arab massacres of Jews and the defenselessness that British mandate government imposed on the Jewish people. There was no question where mandatory favor lay at this particular juncture of history, and both young men intended to do something about it, though that ultimately cost them their lives.<br /><br />This book takes into account Jewish human rights, as well as Arab rights.

He was the author of more than a dozen highly regarded books, although his name today has fallen almost completely off the radar.<br /><br />In this 268-page volume, he takes to task several volumes of the work of Arnold Toynbee, A Study of History, for its rampant misrepresentation of Jewish history and the Jewish people, from biblical times down to the modern conflict between the Arabs and the Jewish state of Israel.<br /><br />He begins with his 1939 assignment by the New York Post to go to Europe and find a ship carrying Jewish refugees from Hitler's Europe to international mandate Palestine.<br /><br />At the time, he notes sardonically, the western powers had \\"hung out a sign\\" to the peoples about to be engulfed by six years of terror: \\"Do not scream while the alligator is devouring you: it will only infuriate him unnecessarily.\\"<br /><br />And of all those peoples, he adds, \\"none was heard with more impatience and distaste...than the Jews.\\" He accepted the assignment, but arrived in Paris on the day that the Nazis signed a pact with Stalin, and his assignment was relegated to history's dustbin, not least because \\"the traffic in rescue was temporarily disrupted....\\"<br /><br />The Nazis invaded Poland on September 1, and Samuel returned to New York aboard a darkened ship, sailing incommunicado.<br /><br />While in London, Samuel came across the first six volumes of Toynbee's work at Bumpus' bookshop; he'd been hearing favorably of him since 1933, and purchased the set for what he knew would be a silent crossing. His work took Samuel \\"to a mountaintop,\\" and in a moment showed him \\"twenty-odd kingdoms, or rather Societies...\\" bit by bit their living and dead.<br /><br />\\"His universality was stupefying, the range of his references encyclopedic.\\" Samuel was not then arguing with facts as facts. That part came later.<br /><br />He suspected that, vis a vis the Jewish people, Toynbee's facts and history were quite inaccurate, and so he has proved in this little volume. \\"I challenge,\\" he wrote, \\"the account of certain contemporaneous events in the Jewish field\\" and stipulated as well \\"where he has omitted from the record material which he had at his disposal, and which in fact he helped to prepare,\\" so that the results are quite distorted and untrue.<br /><br />Here, Samuel applies the facts that he himself witnessed to Toynbee's analysis. He had trouble with the expressed disapproval of Jewish people, whom Toynbee lumped together with many other long-gone ancient civilizations as \\"two sets of fossilized relics of similar societies, now extinct.\\"<br /><br />Obviously, the Jewish people are not extinct, nor is their history dead, nor could a fossilized condition, as Samuel observed, be laid to the Buddhists of Ceylon, the Christians of Armenia or the Jains in India, among others.<br /><br />And so does Toynbee continuously refer to the Jewish people and the Parsees throughout his work. It dawned on Samuel that \\"the man was quite serious.\\" Yet he had not offered any evidence in the first place, and did not offer any each time he repeated the insults.<br /><br />\\"Whatever Professor Toynbee may mean\\" with regard to others, \\"he means that the Jewish people is spiritually and intellectually a fossil, an inert and petrified form devoid of living juices, a lifeless and unproductive...simulacrum of genuine peoplehood.\\"<br /><br />For further details of Toynbee's libels, read Samuel's book.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

The land was then populated by more than 100,000 Jewish people and roughly 250,000 Arabs, he writes in this documentary of his observations concerning the growth of Zionism and Israel.<br /><br />From a hilltop in northern Samaria he looked down on the Valley of Jezreel and the lower Galilee, which except for a few \\"tiny points lost in the waste... was uninhabited.\\" He was reminded of King Solomon's verses, \\"Your land is laid waste; your cities are burned with fire. Your soil, strangers consume it in your presence, and it is desolate as by the overthrow of strangers.\\"<br /><br />But in 1924, not even the spoilers were present; they had disappeared with their spoils, \\"and only desolation was left.\\"<br /><br />Still, to walk the land, he wrote, was to jostle against \\"the world's foremost immortals.\\" In Nazareth and on the shores of the Galilee, Samuel \\"walked in the footsteps of the supreme teacher of the western world.\\" In Hebron he saw the patriarchs and matriarchs of Israel, In Jerusalem, the \\"summits, valleys and slopes could hardly accommodate the accumulation of sanctities and memories.\\"<br /><br />The Jews of the old city settlements knew the history, and felt a connection to the land, unlike the indifference of Arabs living in single-room huts to accommodate both animals and families. Even without knowledge of history, Samuel wrote, he could have told that the desolation \\"was not native to the place. The crumbled terraces on the hillsides bore witness to a time when men had found their cultivation profitable.\\"<br /><br />There were also gloomy swamps, \\"habitations of disease avoided even by birds...bearing similar witness to human neglect rather than the harshness of nature.\\"<br /><br />My 1944 copy of this book is its fourth printing.

Mohammed accused the three Jewish tribes of Medina (Banu I-Nadir, Banu Qurayza and Banu Qaynuqa) of corrupting the message he had revealed to them, and they were executed or expelled.<br /><br />Jewish communities in Khaybar, Fadak and Wadi I-Qura were either subjugated or forced to pay tribute. In time, all remaining Jews were executed or expelled.<br /><br />In Yemen, however, Jewish tribes remained past the time of Mohammed and into the modern age. They were, according to Parfitt, totally and completely subjugated and forced to pay the annual jizya (poll tax) first implemented by Caliph Omar ibn Abd al-Khattab (634-644).<br /><br />While land remained in the hands of the conquered people, they were forced to pay a kharaj, or land tax, as well as the poll tax, and thus they supported the conquering armies. In exchange for these taxes, while the laws theoretically \\"protected\\" the dhimmis and allowed them to practice their own religion, they also institutionally discriminated against them.<br /><br />Dhimmis could not strike a Muslim, block his path, could not assist one another to oppose a Muslim in any respect, could not build new places of worship or repair old ones, could not ride horses or camels (only donkeys, which they must ride side-saddle and dismount for Muslims to pass), could not hold religious processions or noisy celebrations of any kind, could not proselytize, could not bear arms, could not wink, and were forced to wear distinctive dress so as to be recognizable as dhull, or debased ones.<br /><br />These laws remained in effect at least until the colonial period began in the 19th century. The Jews of Yemen remained then the only minority in Arabia, and they lived for centuries under these draconian laws of conquest.<br /><br />Aside from covering these origins of the Yemenite Jewish community in the opening chapter, this magnificent piece of scholarship examines in close detail their situation from the beginning of the 20th century until their mass exodus from Yemen in the 1950s. In the 1920s, for example, the difficult situation imposed by the British on Jews wishing to emigrate to mandate Palestine applied equally to the Yemenite Jews.<br /><br />At the same time, the ruling Imam, or Yahya, reimposed many of the ancient Islamic customs, including the forced conversion to Islam of orphaned Jewish children. In 1923, a letter to the Jewish community in London spoke of 42 children seized by the authorities and forcibly converted to Islam. Even a 70 year old man was forced to renounce his faith because he too was an orphan. Jewish leaders who tried to rescue them were imprisoned and beaten.<br /><br />The 80 orphans spirited out of Yemen to Aden in 1929 were beset by British authorities with a tax that, if they could not pay, meant their deportation back to Yemen. Finally 250 orphans escaped to British territory. Eventually, help arrived, and some emigrated to Palestine legally, while others fled there illegally.<br /><br />Jews in Yemen were forced to live in a separate Jewish quarter. When they accidentally brushed against a Muslim, they were forced to pay the Muslim for soap to clean themselves. Jews were required to remove human feces from Muslim areas in Sanaa and then elsewhere. These measures were introduced at the beginning of the 19th century and reintroduced in about 1913.<br /><br />Jews figure til today in Yemeni proverbs as objects of contempt.<br /><br />I once knew a lovely Yemenite Muslim woman, kind and gentle, who at the height of the suicide bombing wave in Israel condemned the perpetrators and their minders as \\"evil.\\" She insisted that in her country, Jews and Muslims got along very well together. I have no doubt that was her personal experience.<br /><br />Overall, however, this brilliant, 285-page book belies that notion, for the most part, as myth.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

There is the obligatory explanation (brief) of biblical history as well as that of all subsequent conquests, including the 7th century Muslim conquest of the land.<br /><br />As the book explains, lands can die, and under its successive conquerors, Israel died: the plants and animals perished, and the land became a barren one, of desert and swamp.

It is indeed (as other reviewers note) excellent. In it, Dadrian considers the history of the Armenian genocide insofar as its \\"root causes, the protracted phases, the escalation, and the violent consummation\\" in 1915.<br /><br />This of course requires careful review of the Abdul Hamid era, and the massacres that occurred in 1894 through 1896, as well as the genocide during the First World War. But in the process of reviewing this history, Dadrian also covers the what he calls in the concluding chapter the \\"three arch determinants of the Turko-Armenian conflict\\"--namely theocracy, demography and power.<br /><br />Theocracy, he points out, itself has two components, one relating to a belief system (in this case Islam), and the second to how that system is applied to social dealings and politics of every kind. Islam, he notes, had features which overshadowed its piety and professed recognition of the two other monotheisms (Judaism and Christianity) \\"which proved liabilities for the multiethnic political system that the Ottoman Empire was.\\" Firstly is its \\"inexorable divisiveness,\\" which splits the social universe into two \\"irreconcilable, basically hostile camps, namely believers and unbelievers.\\" Secondly is Islam's militaristic spirit, \\"bent on conquest, subjugation and expansionist dominion.\\" The plight of non-Muslims, and in this case Armenians, was \\"created under these conditions,\\" and indeed they extended from the Ottoman era into the Kemalist era that followed.<br /><br />According to the Sharia, Dadrian writes, equality was essentially anathema to Islam and its sacred law.<br /><br />In addition to outlining these principals, Dadrian reviews in much detail the actual planning and perpetration of the genocide, and includes many of the most gory details, all of which are exceedingly well documented, largely by Turkish and German sources. Dadrian holds that relying on enemies of the Ottomans, such as the British, would raise questions in the eyes of the Turks, and therefore he has always based his work on the available Turkish and German and Austrian files, which fortunately are quite numerous.<br /><br />What is most disheartening about this book, and the interview I had after reading it, is that Dadrian is not at all optimistic about the future of the Armenian people. Their fate is intertwined with the power of the Turkish state, which is growing ever stronger, and is once again becoming increasingly Islamic.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

This experience was repeated in 1849, as recorded by British Counsel James Finn (1806-1872); after Sir Moses Montefiore attempted a census, a plague did indeed fall upon the land, and lasted three months.<br /><br />On the second hand, being counted usually meant oncoming hardship-conscription or, worse, having to pay the annual head tax. So it was the natural inclination of the Jewish people to prefer being under counted, if they were counted at all. A census of the whole people under an oriental government, noted W. Gibson in 1857, was a thing unknown.<br /><br />Nevertheless, taking many reliable sources, Parfitt pieces together here as well-founded an estimate of the Jewish population of Palestine, year by year, as can be obtained anywhere.<br /><br />Take Jerusalem. In 1823, 10,000 Jews lived in in the Holy City, or half the population. By 1847, the number was estimated at 7,000 to 10,000, although the population overall had shrunk to 18,000. In 1867, the population was down again, to 15,000, with Jews again making up roughly half the people. Likewise in 1882, the Jewish people of Jerusalem constituted half the people.<br /><br />Similar accountings are to be found here for the other centers of Jewish life--Hebron, Safed and Tiberias--as well as the population of all of Eretz Yisrael--and often as not the Jewish populations were also half the local totals in other cities. This in itself is quite a revelation, since other dhimmi populations had dwindled to much lower percentages of the total in their homelands by the 19th century.<br /><br />In the 1880s, a small fraction of the mases in Anatolia, for example, were Armenian; the majority were Turks. Similarly, Greeks made up considerably less than half the total population of the city once known as Constantinople. By comparison, the Jewish population of Israel held up fairly well against that of Muslims and Arabs.<br /><br />This book is not simply a counting of heads, however. It also explains in great detail the hardships which accrued to the Jewish people who lived in Palestine from 1800 to 1882. Life was anything but easy.<br /><br />Aside from suffering the onerous taxes of the Ottoman empire, the Jewish people also withstood the extortion--\\"protection money\\"--of local sheiks, not to mention the various raiding parties, disease and other calamities that befell them regularly.<br /><br />In 1834, according to an account of Rabbi Yisrael of Shklov, \\"the wild gentiles, our evil neighbors from the town and the surrounding villages, revolted...and they came to the city (Safed) armed with swords ...and killed and wasted, children and the aged alike, babies and women...and they looted and pillaged ...for 33 days and nights. And they emptied all the city....\\" Other contemporaries gave similar pictures. In 1841, Yisrael Bak (1797-1874) described his experience in 1834: \\"the gentiles living there [Safed] ...looted and plundered the Jews... and destroyed my printing works so that nothing remained...and were it not for the mercy of the Holy One, Blessed be He, I would have lost my life, God Forbid.\\"<br /><br />While the number dead may not have been many, a great number were wounded. Women were raped and Torah scrolls desecrated. And this was just one episode. There were many others like it.<br /><br />This series of 1834 attacks was followed by an earthquake in 1837 (in which at least 2,158 Jewish people and possibly as many as 4,000 perished in Safed alone) and a southern Lebanese Druze attack on the city in 1838. The Muslim towns people joined them and the town was sacked overnight. Once again, women were raped and men tortured, and the Druze exacted 75,000 piastres from the ruined town, which they left as a scene of devastation.<br /><br />As Parfitt notes, the Jews not infrequently served as the butt of hatred for foreign rulers, a further example being the sacking of Safed after the evacuation of French troops in 1799. These attacks impoverished the communities, such that life was even more difficult to sustain than before, they reduced the numbers of Jewish people in the land, and they prevented further immigration to the land.<br /><br />These details and many more reveal the extent to which the Jewish people held onto their holy homeland in the face of daunting odds, intense discrimination and outright attack.<br /><br />This fine book is an important addition to any library on the Middle East.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

If anything, the encyclopedic nature of the book makes it an imperative addition to the bookshelf of anyone studying or writing about Islam today.<br /><br />As reviewers of another edition have noted, although Hughes was a western church man, his understanding of Islam is vast and deep. For every definition, he goes to original Islamic sources and scholars to flesh them out. Especially in the case of key definitions, he takes great pains.<br /><br />Take the definition of Jihad. This goes on for nearly six (double columned) pages and includes the basis of jihad, its sources from the Koran, a synopsis of long chapters in the traditions (Hadith), as well as teachings of the four main schools of Sunni Islam, Hanafi, Maliki, Sha'afi and Hanbali.<br /><br />Jihad is technically \\"a striving,\\" but is known primarily as striving to \\"a religious war with those who are unbelievers in the mission of Muhammad. It is an incumbent religious duty, established in the Qu'ran and the traditions as a divine institution, and enjoined especially for the purpose of advancing Islam and of repelling evil from Muslims.\\" When an infidel's country is conquered by Muslims, its inhabitants have three alternatives--to adopt Islam, in which case the people become \\"enfranchised citizens,\\" to pay a poll tax (jizya), or death by the sword.<br /><br />The definition contains many of the details as to how and where that holy war must be carried out. The same detail, and more than four pages, are alloted to the definition of Masjid (mosque). Once a property or land has been a mosque or belonged to Muslims, it is considered forever Islamic and cannot be sold or decommissioned.<br /><br />There is no arguing with the authenticity of these definitions, just as there is no arguing with most of the contents of this priceless work.<br /><br />This edition is apparently the only hardbound one currently extant.

The former holds that the history of Turkey  as known today doesn't consist merely of Ottoman history, but is much older and in fact dispersed culture to all nations, including the Greek classical nation, the Hittites, the Chinese, the Romans and all European nations. The latter holds that Turkish was the first language ever spoken by humans, and is the foundation for all other languages, be they classical Greek and Latin, Romance languages or even Anglo-Saxon tongues.<br /><br />By way of these theories, the Turkish educational system still, today, teaches that Turkish society is supremacist, and that it is from Turkish history and language that all other culture and languages flow. One can according to these theories allow that there was, for example, a beautiful Greek civilization, but at the same time, one holds that this was not independent, but a derivative of the Turkish culture and history.<br /><br />What is even more astounding is that there are those historians, including Bernard Lewis, who make apology for this supremacist line.<br /><br />Since the European Union is now considering whether Turkey should join its ranks, it would be highly beneficial for all European citizens--but especially European officials--to read this short but powerful book. To the extent that the racist teachings exposed herein are still taught today in Turkey, and are still regarded as truth by the mass of educated Turks, this book is a warning against Turkish admission to the EU.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

It also presents the ways in which Israel is like every where else.<br /><br />It's sad to say that readers have to be reminded that in Israel, like every where else, the sun rises and sets, the seasons change and the weather is a topic of conversation. Israelis care about the past, the present and the future, and they like sports. And so on.<br /><br />There are plain, factual presentations concerning the government, economy, geography and land. The book also covers the Oslo accords and their aftermath, the beginning of the second intifada and the disagreements internationally and within Israel over the Jewish \\"settlements\\" in the West Bank and Gaza.<br /><br />My only quarrel with this discussion is that it fails to note the larger creation of Arab settlements in the same areas since 1993, and does not correctly refer to these areas as the disputed territories that they are.

Clearly, the publishers have very little notion of what children of that age bracket can read. This book is more appropriate for children aged 8 to 12, which is a far different reading level.<br /><br />Beyond that, the book is not really about Israel, but about Israel's non-Jewish minorities, who make up less than a quarter of Israel's population. That would be fine, were not every page filled with arguments pointedly indicating why the author feels that Israel should not be a Jewish state.<br /><br />For the most part, the facts (such as there are) are taken out of their regional context, failing to note that while every Arab state surrounding Israel also have non-Muslim minorities, they are all governed by variations on Islamic law, and consider themselves Islamic theocracies.<br /><br />Furthermore the book accepts the ridiculous notion that Palestinians are descended from the vanished people called Philistines. It's true that Arabs today calling themselves Palestinians take their name from the Philistines, but those ancient people disappeared from the land 3,000 years ago, and today's Arab residents are either descendants of the various Muslim conquerors of Israel (beginning with the Arab conquest in 636) or more recent immigrants (within the last 150 to 200 years).<br /><br />It's fine to have a book about Israel's minorities. Such volumes are very much in demand, and needed. But the title of this book is a misnomer. It should more accurately have been titled Israel's Minorities.

Both, Ye'or notes in an essay entitled \\"Historical Amnesia,\\" are in the process of globalization.<br /><br />This is not the benign economic globalization that most Westerners laud. Islamic jihad and dhimmitude trade in every available means-military, political, technological and intellectual. And if the towering collection of 63 essays (including Ye'or's) contained in this new book is to be believed, these specific Islamic processes are globalizing at a disturbingly rapid pace. The book, courageously assembled by Robert Spencer, provides historical and contemporary profiles of jihad and dhimmitude.<br /><br />In six sections, the book delineates how Islamic ideology has affected non-Muslims both historically and in the contemporary world. The first three sections cover the myth vs. historical realities and Islamic law and practice regarding non-Muslims. The last three sections cover how the myth of Islamic tolerance has affected contemporary geopolitics, power politics at the United Nations and, finally, academic and public discourse. It is Ibn Warraq's forward and the latter 400 pages in which this book really shines. He explains:<br /><br />Islam is a totalitarian ideology that aims to control the religious, social and political life of mankind in all its aspects; the life of its followers without qualification; and the life of those who follow the so-called tolerated religions to a degree that prevents their activities from getting in the way of Islam in any way. And I mean Islam, I do not accept some spurious distinction between Islam and 'Islamic fundamentalism' or Islamic terrorism'.<br /><br />The September 11, 2001 murderers acted canonically. They followed Sharia, a collection of theoretical laws and ideals \\"that apply in any ideal Muslim community.\\" This body of regulations, based on divine authority, according to devout Muslims \\"must be accepted without criticism, without doubts and questions.\\" It sacrifices the individual's desires and good to those of the community.<br /><br />That apostasy is not today mentioned in the legal codes of most Islamic countries, Warraq notes, hardly implies freedom of religion for Muslims in those states; their penal codes are filled with Islamic laws. The myth of Islamic tolerance is defied by the massacre and extermination of the Zoroastrians in Iran; the million Armenians in Turkey; the Buddhists and Hindus in India; the more than six thousand Jews in Fez, Morocco, in 1033; hundreds of Jews killed in Cordoba between 1010 and 1013; the entire Jewish community of Granada in 1066; the Jews in Marrakesh in 1232; the Jews of Tetuan, Morocco in 1790; the Jews of Baghdad in 1828; and so on ad nauseum.<br /><br />Ironically, despite Islam's immutability, the myth evolved through the Western propensity to criticize its civilization. In 98 CE, Roman historian Tacitus in Germania compared the noble simplicity of the Germans with the vices of contemporary Rome. Michele do Montaigne (1533-1592) in circa 1580 painted noble savages based on dubious secondhand information in order to condemn his own civilization.<br /><br />Later writers substituted Islam for savages to condemn Christendom and materialism. In 1686-89, for example, Huguenot pastor Pierre Jurieu exclaimed that Christians had spilt more blood on St. Bartholemew's Day than had the Saracens in all their persecutions of Christians. Of course, Islam had claimed millions of lives-in 1399, Taimur killed 100,000 Hindus in a single day. But during the 17th century, and later the Enlightenment, writers perpetuated the \\"two ideal prototypes, the noble savage and the wise and urbane Oriental,\\" substituting Turks for Muslims, and Islamic tolerance for Turkish tolerance.<br /><br />Actually, 18th century Turkey was no interfaith utopia. In 1758, a British ambassador noted that Sultan Mustafa III had non-Muslim Christians and Jews executed for wearing banned clothing. In 1770, another ambassador reported that Greeks, Armenians and Jews seen outside their homes after dark were hanged. In 1785, a third noted that Muslim mobs had dismantled churches after Christians had secretly repaired them.<br /><br />\\"The golden age of equal rights was a myth, and belief in it was a result, more than a cause, of Jewish sympathy for Islam,\\" Bernard Lewis wrote in 1968 in the Encyclopedia of Islam. \\"The myth was invented in 19th century Europe as a reproach to Christians-and taken up by Muslims in our own time as a reproach to Jews....\\"<br /><br />Until the late 19th century, Jews in North Africa, Yemen and other oriental Muslim lands, were obliged to live isolated, in special quarters, and \\"were constrained to wear distinctive clothing.\\" They could not carry arms (including canes), and could not give sworn testimony in Muslim jurisdictions.

He shipped a crew of George Williams, chief mate, Aaron Savage, second mate, William Porter, Archibald Robbins, Thomas Burns and several others. He sailed for New Orleans in May 1815, passed the Bahamas and Florida Keys, (not without incident: the ship ran aground, before Riley freed her) and, in early August, reached Gibraltar. While headed for Cape de Verds, Riley ran the Commerce off course, and was shipwrecked in breakers off the Sahara.<br /><br />One man was slaughtered on the beach.<br /><br />Conditions for the rest were pure hell. Captain Riley and those remaining were forced to sell themselves into slavery in order to survive. The party was then divided. Some men  were never seen again, and were presumed to have spent the duration of their days in privation and servitude.<br /><br />Riley and four others were saved in November 1815; in late September, Riley had convinced an Arab merchant to buy himself and those companions, transport them across the desert to Mogadore, and there to ransom them to the British embassy. He tells in great detail the sufferings the men endured during their slavery and travel through the desert. Nineteen months afterwards, Archibald Robbins was ransomed as well. Subsequently, he wrote at length on his own experiences in slavery. During the 19th century, a volume including both this book and Robbins' tale became a bestseller. Today, a copy of Robbins' account is hard to come by.<br /><br />The conditions endured by the infidel slaves is almost unbelievable. This book, reprinted dozens of times in its day, sold millions of copies and influenced abolitionists of Riley's time. The book was of the works that the young Abraham Lincoln read by firelight in Illinois, and strongly influenced his thinking about slavery, as did a visit to the slave market in New Orleans.<br /><br />Mogadore was once a flourishing city, Riley observed, but when he became a freed man there, he observed that \\"superstition, fanaticism, and tyranny bear sway...[and] have swept away, with their pernicious breath, the whole wealth of its once industrious and highly favored inhabitants;--have driven the foreigner from their shores, and it seems as if the curse of Heaven had fallen on the whole land....\\"<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Today, he notes, renewed Jewish sovereignty in Israel has also renewed the mutual reinforcement of Muslim historical experience and doctrinal tradition \\"in a more complete way than in any period of the past, save that of Muhammad's early 'Jewish trials' in Medina.\\" This is expressed in a comprehensive literature of conflict, expressed most influentially and most explicitly through Sayyid Qutb's essay \\"Our Struggle with the Jews.\\"<br /><br />With Muhammad's emigration from Mecca to Medina in 622, the Jewish tribes in Medina refused to recognize his new faith, or him as a divinely appointed messenger. If the Jews would not admit the superiority of the new tradition, writes Nettler, then \\"Islam would have to force the issue,\\" which of course, it did. The results \\"determined much of Islam's subsequent ideas about and relations with the Jews.\\" Later on, the Islamic view of Christians also deteriorated sharply.<br /><br />Muhammad's anti-pagan campaign against the people of Mecca \\"was augmented by an anti-Jewish strategy.\\" Every Muslim action against the pagans was followed by an action against the three Jewish tribes of Medina, which ended with the expulsion or murder of all Jewish tribesmen. The capstone of the strategy was the attack on the Jews of Khaybar, a northern suburb of Medina. The result was uncompromising Judaeophobia within Islam, \\"and the notion that suppression of the Jews was one key to renewed worldly success.\\"Having the power to suppress and denigrate Jews \\"was politically right in Allah's world,\\" and culminated in \\"a deeply felt hatred of and animosity towards the Jews.\\"<br /><br />Zionism and the state of Israel brought a crisis of identity to Islam, for Israel meant that Jews were no longer \\"in their [dhimmi] place.\\" Now, a new literary form arose to express virulent Judaeophobia, namely through anti-Zionism. But all this, according to Nettler, \\"derived from ancient Muslim sources and ground to a fine edge of unprecedented hatred.\\" Already in the 1920s, Hassan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, exhorted Muslims to excel \\"in the art of death.... Nothing degrades us more than love of this world and fear of death.\\" For such fundamentalists, Nettler concludes, Israel was a \\"theoretical problem of the greatest magnitude,\\" and it was theological in a very political realm. The Jewish state seemed a threat to the very social and political fiber of Islam. Shaykh 'Abd al-Halim Mahmud, rector of Al-Azhar University in Cairo during Anwar Sadat's early years of rule, for example, wrote that Allah commanded Muslims \\"to fight the friends of Satan,\\" and \\"among Satan's friends--indeed his best friends in our age--are the Jews....\\"<br /><br />Secular nationalism also appropriated this theological argument, and secularized it. But the fundamentalists argued that Western influences of every kind were instruments of the Jews and the Zionists.<br /><br />The Qutb essay highlighted in this discussion, and reproduced here, was originally written and published in the 1950s and reprinted and issued by the Saudi government in 1970. It is filled with the most remarkable hatred about the \\"evil nature\\" of the Jewish people, that it takes ones breath away. The special significance of the Jewish people is that their \\"status as People of theBook does not change the existing reality that they, like the polytheists, are the worst enemies of the Muslims!!\\" Much of this, as Nettler points out, is based on the Qu'ran itself and the early writings of Islamic jurists and thinkers. For example the great 11th century Muslim exegete al-Zamakhshari wrote concerning Surah five, verse 85 of al Ma'idah, that Allah \\"even indicated that the Jews far exceeded the polytheists in this enmity, by mentioning them first, before the polytheists.\\"<br /><br />The difficulty of finding a copy of this book is great, but libraries still have it, even after 18 years, and, to understand the extent and roots of fundamentalist Islamic hatred of the Jewish people, it is worth the search.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

The letters would have been meaningless, but for the fact that, as time wore on, Friedmann tracked more and more of the news as it occurred, citing most major global publications, news agencies from the far left to far right and many dozens in between. Throughout his e-letters, he quoted key passages from key articles in key publications. The result is 1154 pages of text, plus indexes, which detail the last four years of hell.<br /><br />Agree or disagree with Friedmann's points or point of view, one cannot but admire the mass of information that he painstakingly and objectively recorded for posterity.<br /><br />In the early months of the conflict, Friedmann approached certain news sources with some skepticism. He cited WorldNetDaily, while noting for example that while the publication seemed in line with the moral majority; he could nevertheless find no fault with the news outlet's logic.<br /><br />As the news developed and Friedmann's skill along with it, he learned to trust those who seemed most logical most of the time, but never let anyone off the hook completely. For Israel, what was shaping up was a situation as bad as any since 1948, and for the world, a world war not quite like any ever before.<br /><br />\\"The weekly e-letters are compiled in this book to provide a historical diary of one of the most important periods for Israel, the U.S., and the free world,\\" Friedmann notes in his introduction. \\"Week after week, one terror atrocity chases another, to an extent that it numbs the senses.\\" But writing about the \\"morbid reality\\" gave Friedmann an ability to negotiate the madness in a theater of the absurd, enabled him \\"to cope with this human insanity not by ignoring it, but rather by facing it and sharing my observations and thoughts with others.\\"<br /><br />Occasionally the text is broken by humor, such as the geographical Purim story in which King Achashverosh was Finnish with his disobedient wife Vashti. \\"USA a very stubborn man,\\" the Chile Haman would tell Mordechai, on whom he would Czech daily. \\"If you keep this up, Denmark my words! ...Just Kuwait and see, you Turkey!\\" Instead, Esther informed the King, \\"Spain full for me ...but Haman is Russian to kill my people,\\" where upon Haman and his ten sons were hanged, and sent to the Netherlands.<br /><br />Freidmann quotes heavily from the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), Independent Media Research Analysis (IMRA) and several other like translation and transmission services that provide English translations and analysis of articles from prominent Arabic, Turkish, Farsi and other middle eastern language media. So long as such hatred exists in the world, western analysts must expose it.<br /><br />He also confers on readers the sense that history repeats. \\"I see this period as an exact replication of Hitler's wanting the Sudetenland,\\" he writes, \\"and the world thinking that giving up Czechoslovakia would satisfy his 'living space' ambitions.\\" This was of course a great mistake in the appeasement-based Munich agreement, and of sacrificing the weak to preserve the integrity of those perceived to be less threatened by such loss.<br /><br />It was during this period, he observes, that the Oslo agreements were exposed as nothing less than a Trojan Horse, which clarified the pan-Arabic and pan-Islamic ambitions to destroy Israel and toeventually engulf the entire world.<br /><br />Abu Mazen and Abu Ala both declared on the 40th day anniversary of Arafat's death, Friedmann writes, that violence in itself is not inherently wrong, but that it is inexpedient, and is \\"against the interests of the Palestinians\\" at this time.<br /><br />Thus he included both anti-Semitism and terrorism in the title of the book, with the understanding that dehumanization and vilification, such as that contained in daily Palestinian Authority communications of every kind, generally ends up with violence and genocide.<br /><br />During the process of writing these e-letters, Friedmann obviously grew, and expanded the reach of his missives as well. By the time he concluded his diary in August 2004, he was reaching some 400,000 readers worldwide. It can only benefit all mankind if these two volumes extend that audience still further.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

For the audience, it is reading the results, for consuming these poems is an act of discovery, not always about the poet, sometimes about oneself.<br /><br />The poems are sinuous, supple, sensuous and chock full of mixed metaphors that turn and twist and generally come to some point sharpness that transcends the specifics of the poet's life and those characters that are or were part of it.<br /><br />In \\"The Pick,\\" Woloch turns a chore into a piece of high art, for example. Her father was \\"turning the backyard into terraces,/ breaking the hill into two flat plains.\\" She took his power for granted, though it frightened her. She watched as \\"he swung the pick into the air,\\" lowered it hard, \\"and changed the shape of the world,/ and changed the shape of the world again.\\" Fathers can do that.<br /><br />Occasionally there is a cliched poem that starts and ends weakly, but then comes a recovery, such as \\"Tin.\\"<br /><br />The poet \\"snagged against my love and married him for the ragged tin of his arms.\\" The language again caresses the object of love, but then \\"the sparks of silver\\" seen from the corner of one's eyes when no one is there \\"are not hallucinations... but trails of light from one world to the next.\\" She means to say, \\"I have given him up.

(The contents are in the back, so the book reads like a story, unfolding without a predetermined path.)<br /><br />As the poet sits in a Prague cafe, a Gypsy boy approaches. \\"A policeman on the corner nods\\" and two skinheads chase the boy to the river like wild, mad dogs, \\"their/ brains turned into froth.\\" Yet Havel, after visiting Auschwitz, tells the radio audience \\"he still doesn't/ understand how the Holocaust/ could have happened in Europe.\\"<br /><br />As for the past, the pain is staggering. In Lety by Pisek, a Czech guard held \\"children's heads/ in a pail of water/ until the died.\\" The bigger ones, he drowned \\"in the rain barrels or in the lake.\\" In the cold of winter, he locked small children outside the barracks, naked. When they howled like wolves, the mothers lost their minds.<br /><br />Further on, a mother laments, she escaped Hitler's youth gangs by escaping to Prague, but was interned in Lety, where she survived starvation,/ shootings,/ lethal injections,/ work gangs,/ beatings,/ rapes,/ typhus,/ and drownings/ in the rain barrel.\\" She married a white man to save her eight children her fate. One son inherited her dark Gypsy skin. Now, he's recovering from two operations \\"after the skinheads/ impaled him on a metal pole.\\" She doesn't \\"know if I'm living/ in 1939 or 1995.\\" She thought she had survived, but realizes she has \\"only been/ staggering around in circles.\\"<br /><br />Read these poems, and one gets a glimpse of the truth, blood, bones, and all.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Moderate scholars even today today proclaim that these laws remain in force.<br /><br />These 20 chapters cover everything from how to appoint an imam, impose land and poll taxes on conquered peoples and divide booty and slaves. They also define the realm of jihad and explain how wars may be  waged for the public good. Finally they discuss rulings that govern criminal actions.<br /><br />Upon opening, Mawardi discusses the establishment of \\"imamate,\\" which he considers necessary to determine rules over Muslims. He writes that the appointed imam must be obeyed --- and followed whether good or bad. Following the good, Mawardi observes, rewards both good people and leaders in the next life. Following bad leaders, he concludes, rewards followers and somehow (inexplicably) punishes the offensive leaders. (p. 11)<br /><br />Furthermore, Mawardi notes, once the \\"obligation\\" has been established, following the imam is incumbent on all Muslim believers, socially and collectively. He equates this rule with the mandate that all believers also practice \\"jihad and the acquisition of knowledge.\\" Mawardi explains that the imam's seven requirements include \\"courage and bravery enabling them to defend the territory of Islam and to mount jihad against the enemy,\\" to pursue perpetual jihad.<br /><br />Chapter 4, on the Amirate of Jihad, is especially enlightening. Here Mawardi details wartime efforts required against non-believers. Men and horses must be treated with kindness, Mawardi contends, and warriors must attend battle both \\"light and heavy and fight with your wealth.\\" Moreover, Mawardi instructs followers to ensure that these men are \\"vigorous and brave and aware that [they] will not fail....\\" In other words, if believers cannot win the war, then Mawardi writes that God forbids them to fight. Mawardi observes that sharia doctrine requires believers to engage only in wars they can win. (p. 64)<br /><br />Mawardi also teaches that Muslims must fight those people invited to Islam who rejected it. He instructs fighters \\"to harry [them] from their houses and to inflict damage on them day and night, by fighting and burning; or else to declare war and combat them in ranks....\\" If Muslims attack and kill people not yet invited to Islam, Mawardi instructs them to pay \\"blood money,\\" (p. 60) albeit with lesser amounts than required for Muslims who have been killed.<br /><br />Mawardi instructs jihad fighters a) not to retreat before an army twice as large, b) to fight for victory, to c) share war spoils among Muslims and d) not to allow preferences for relatives in dividing the spoils. (pp. 70-73) Mawardi notes that all four actions must also accompany prayers to annihilate the \\"the enemies of Allah....\\"<br /><br />Readers definitely obtain a clear understanding of sharia law.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

This is not such a volume.<br /><br />Beginning from the preface, which in hysterical tones accuses Israel of committing genocide, to the last pages, this is a book loaded with code-words calling for Israel's destruction. It's full of &#34;humiliation,&#34; &#34;murder,&#34; &#34;genocide,&#34; and the like.<br /><br />Had those things actually been perpetrated by Israel, I would be first in line to condemn them. But even the United Nations has concluded that Israel has not committed genocide, in Jenin, or anywhere else. As for murder, it seems that the only murder is taking place by Palestinians against Israeli civilians, and that whosoever amongst Palestinians has been killed has died either in battle, in the line of fire, or by accident, for which Israel has apologized. When, on the other hand, was the last time a Palestinian leader actually sought an end to suicide bombings, because they are evil, not because they are inexpedient.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this book is that for most of the events that Hamzeh reports, she relies on hearsay. There has been no scientific or objective attempt to verify the information, much less the veracity of the sources. Even that might be all right, had the reporter not assumed an hysterical tone. But Hamzeh is so willing to believe everything nasty she hears about Israel or Israelis, or Jews for that matter, that nothing escapes unscathed.<br /><br />I want peace, but books like this one--filled with blame and outright hatred--do nothing to promote it.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Here, she has masterfully portrayed the means by which the Euro-Arab Dialogue (EAD) unfolded over the past 30-plus years, and how that process relates to the World War II Axis--as well as the historical, 1,400-year jihad.<br /><br />\\"There are three forms of jihad,\\" says Bat Ye'or today, \\"the military jihad, the economic jihad and the cultural jihad.\\" The EAD between the European Union and the Arab League has been a means of spreading the economic and cultural jihads from the Middle East to Europe.<br /><br />The process outlined here began with Charles DeGaulle's 1967 pronouncement that henceforward, France would assume a pro-Arab policy. In 1971, France began selling arms to Qaddafi, a step from which the EAD flowed as naturally as it did from DeGaulle's policy initiative.<br /><br />Another factor, according to Bat Ye'or, was the French desire to regain a leading role in European history; Georges Pompidou furthered the process in October 1973, following the Syrian and Egyptian Yom Kippur war with Israel.<br /><br />At that time, the Arab world imposed an oil embargo on Denmark, Holland and the U.S., cut oil production and began to raise oil prices by five percent a month. These new global geopolitics terrified the leaders of Germany and France.<br /><br />Before it agreed to establish the EAD, the Arab League had demanded that Europe establish pro-Arab and anti-American policies in all their united political, cultural and economic endeavors. The oil embargo was the catalyst which finally moved the European Economic Community to action. Now, writes Bat Ye'or, EEC ministers enacted resolutions that met the Arab demands, and which at the same time reversed the true intent of United Nations Resolution 242. Only then was the Arab oil embargo to Europe lifted.<br /><br />Through this give and take, Europe was mostly on the losing end, for the EAD contained from the start a significant rider to its economic agreements concerning oil. Now, a process unfolded whereby Arab culture, politics and faith were imported into Europe along with a militant Muslim population that refused to assimilate into European culture. Arab culture did not change, while European universities and politics changed radically.<br /><br />Bat Ye'or also shows how the EAD renewed and fostered Europe's Axis ties to the Middle East: In the late 1940s and 1950s war criminals fled Europe to Egypt, Syria and other Arab nations. Now, Axis links to Europe were rekindled through the Middle Eastern policies imported into Europe. The new Europe was built on a unified anti-Israel and anti-American policy.<br /><br />As Bat Ye'or also suggests, America is the last frontier, and the American people should take it as their duty to avoid Europe's fate.<br /><br />Read this book for the depressing details.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

The same term describes the return of anyone of Jewish faith from the Diaspora to the ancient Jewish homeland of Israel.<br /><br />This collection marks Reva Sharon's journey of Aliyah, from the U.S. to Jerusalem, Israel in the 1980s. It is no wonder that Hiam Chertok considered this work \\"high achievement by a poet in the fullness of her talent,\\" or that the late Robert Friend praised Sharon's expressions of \\"a life lived with open-eyed commitment and realistic responsibility.\\"<br /><br />The eponymous epigraph poem opens with an epigraph from Jeremiah, \\"Even the way by which thou wentest;/ Return.\\"<br /><br />In it, Sharon harkens to the voice Moses heard within the Burning Bush. The debris of winter smoulders while occasional flames leap in the mouth of the river. She hears the strains of the harp and flute before the morning light, and will tie her sandals so as to rise to her journey, along an ancient trade route, \\"back through the cradle/ to another dawn/ brekhat tzefira [in the pool of the morning wind].\\"<br /><br />The other 32 poems fall easily into three sections, the first of which (\\"Partial Eclipses\\") marks the poet's good-byes. Here she addresses her parents. Black butterflies flicker at the corners of their vision \\"and the surgeon's knife/ has removed more than flesh.\\" She knows her parents, in crisis,  have no use for gifts. She closes their door and searches between the street lamps for darkness \\"where memories shimmer like heat/ on a colder road.\\" In \\"Bridges,\\" she shows her father the place where their rivers separate gleams in the winter sun, a bridge of love and tears that spans from ancestors' bedrock \\"through the fretwork of my poem/ and beyond.\\"<br /><br />The last poem in this divide carries the poignantly appropriate name, \\"Ascent.\\" Here she sings to her mother of finding a bridge through the mist like her grandmother when she left HER mother and landed in a new mother tongue. And she continues her journey home. She will fill her pockets with ancient stones when she arrives in \\"lion-colored hills/ And I will sing/ in the pool of the morning wind.\\"<br /><br />The epigraph to the next eight poems is from Ecclesiastes: \\"The wind goeth toward the south,/ And turneth around until the north;/ All the rivers run into the sea...\\" These works tighten the reader's grip on nature, the earth. The \\"you\\" in every poem is as much the earth as another person. \\"Stepping Over the Edge,\\" for example, is a love song, but also embraces the earth and Israel. As a lover of sun and lunar radiance, the land calls and she trembles again. She feels the pulse of the land's dreams, and shudders awake. \\"I am liquid/spilling through locks/ down a dark corridor/ toward the last/ guarded gates.\\"<br /><br />The last 12 poems open with an epigraph from Isaiah: \\"A remnant shall return.../From the flood of the River.../...ye shall be gathered one by one...\\" Several poems take on the unanswerable questions raised by the Holocaust. \\"Arbeit Macht Frei\\" is addressed to a survivor whose work, the poet laments, can take him long past memory and dreams, but can never make him free. Three others speak of and to the victims of Terezin, whose spirits haunt the silence of that unlit place where everyone now walks and cries out, \\"Why?\\"<br /><br />\\"What Whispers\\" hears the perished thousands \\"from the pocket/ of a slain poet\\" - their voices eternally circle whispers in the single Hebrew word for spirit, Ruach, which also means wind, and breath. This spirit wind rises to the heights of Zion and returns again whispering.<br /><br />I cannot begin to do these poems justice. They are poems of longing, poems of fulfillment, poems of history, poems of future, all together. They celebrate the Jewish people's link to the land. In \\"Covenant,\\" Sharon concludes, that it is in Israel where the unsolvable \\"riddle of being/ roots me/\\"in Jerusalem, where light and dust and wind are fused with salt and bones and song.<br /><br />I am thrilled to own this book.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

While it originally meant the family of one's spouse, and their entire entourage, today the term also loosely applies to the entire family.<br /><br />Thus, in this collection of 37 poems and stories, Stanley Barkan takes the liberty of dividing the work into two sections, one composed of 16 poems about himself and his extended family, and a second with 20 poems about his wife Bebe and her family. In between, readers are treated to 16 color plates of Bebe Barkan's gorgeous paintings. Another painting of Barkan's in-laws as bride and groom adorns the collection's cover.<br /><br />The slight 4.5 by 6.5 inch size belies its weighty and beautiful content--poems and art work with which anyone can relate, even if they're not part of this particular mishpocheh. All of them address the human condition in general and the Jewish condition within that human family, in particular. If one has no knowledge of the 1648 Chmielnicki pogroms or the 1940s Operation Reinhardt, one will learn of them in these searing poems, and come away more human for the knowing.<br /><br />One especially telling poem, addressed to the poet Jack Hirschman, \\"a little left of Stalin,\\" tells of Barkan's uncle Jake, who saved his father from a cutthroat cossack so they could cross the Dnieper, walk to France and fight with the Allies in World War I. One brother made it; Uncle Jake is buried in Verdun, with a hero's medal on his Jewish grave. \\"I tell you,\\" writes the poet to his friend, \\"no ideology,/ no 'ism,'/ no one way/ works for Jews.\\" Somehow they all end up killing Jews. In telling his friend to come down from his Russian Hill, Barkan swears to stay on Tel Aviv, his Hill of Spring.<br /><br />In another especially poignant work, \\"Words My Father Left Me,\\" Barkan talks of the words engraved in his brain--of fictional pathfinders \\"always there/ to show us the way,\\" and of real adventures along the Rhine, in Koblenz, Cologne, Mainz--words turned into stories, \\"A legacy far richer than all the gold/ this waking world has to offer.\\"<br /><br />Then there was Barkan's Uncle Sam, no not the U.S. Government, but another of his doughboy uncles, who survived one lightning strike and a brush with the live third rail in New York's IRT subway line, with a \\"scar down the middle of his granite face.\\" He too had met his share of Jew-haters, who swore \\"God save us from the goddamn Jews.\\" He abruptly left, stony-faced, one friend's dinner table.<br /><br />And his grandmothers, one he knew, and one he didn't.<br /><br />Readers meet all these characters and many more--real people--and come away from these poems far richer.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Having known several true Holocaust survivors, and heard their stories, I certainly didn't.<br /><br />Now, there have now been several clear and thorough exposes of the fraud perpetrated by Bruno Grosjean Dossekker, who falsely claimed here to be one Binjamin Wilkomirski, a child survivor of the Holocaust. Stefan Maechler, The New Yorker, 60 Minutes and several other publications prove beyond any doubt that Wilkomirski is no such person and that Fragments is a fiction.<br /><br />Every possible lead has now been followed; each detail in Dossekker's narration of \\"events\\" has been compared with historical records from such leading Holocaust scholars as Raul Hilberg and Lawrence Langer, accounts of other child survivors, interviews with members of the Dossekker and Grosjean families and more.<br /><br />The strongest evidence, unearthed by Stephan Maechler, is the fact that in 1981, Dossekker/Wilkomirski contested the will of Yvonne Grosjean, whom, in a letter to officials in Bern Switzerland, he called \\"my birth mother.\\" Dossekker/Wilkomirski received a third of her estate.<br /><br />Other evidence includes Dossekker/Wilkomirski's use of Laura Grabowski to \\"corroborate\\" his story. Grabowski claims to have known him in a children's home in Krakow. In fact, Grabowski is an American citizen of Christian faith who has since her youth fabricated stories about her victimhood, the most well-publicized being a book called Satan's Underground.<br /><br />The Social Security number of said Lauren Stratford is the same as that of Grabowski, who subsequently used it to make a false survivor's claim.

With an account of the Sufferings of her Surviving Officers and Crew, Who were Enslaved by the Wandering Arabs on the Great African Desart, or Zahahrah; and Observations Historical, Geographical,& c, made During the Travels of the Author, While a Slave to the Arabs, and in the Empire of Morocco\\" --- was reprinted dozens of times, and sold more than a million copies in his own time.<br /><br />The most recent reprint was in [[ASIN:1599212110 2006]], under the substantially shortened title Sufferings in Africa. Another volume by Commerce able seaman  [[ASIN:1110488505 Archibald Robbins]] was also massively popular in its time.<br /><br />From these and other accounts of the day, King has cobbled together a highly readable tale. This book offers adventure, morals, ethics, and history, all in one. The book details the heart wrenching story of sailors shipwrecked on Cape Bojador off the coast of the Sahara, and forced to submit themselves to slavery simply to stay alive. There is no doubt that these accounts, in their time, played a great role in the abolition movement in the U.S. Men who had experienced the condition of slavery went to great lengths to call for an end to the practice in the Americas.<br /><br />As a backdrop, King details the calamitous effects of the War of 1812 on commercial shipping in New England and the limited prospects of land employment that drove men like Archie Robbins to the sea. Captain Riley's men were mostly young and ambitious, but a few had already endured terrible trials. Robbins, for example, had been imprisoned by the British three times in six years--and that after being hired out to a local farmer at age eight, and escaping to the sea at age 15. Antonio Michel, an old sailor on his way home after years on the sea, had recently been wrecked on Tenerife, the largest of the Canary Islands, and came on board to work his way back across the Atlantic.<br /><br />One can understand, following the shipwreck, how different the cultures portrayed. The Sahara is a world with little respect for human life, and less for human liberty. Once in bondage, the men lose even the right to eat clean or human foot. They are reduced to groveling, filthy spectacles, valued only for the work and services they can deliver.<br /><br />Only through Riley's perseverance and plan were some of the men ultimately liberated: From inside a clan based feudal system, Riley determined to play to the Arabs' greed, and offer handsome ransoms if Sidi Hamet would buy him and his men from their masters, and spirit them across the desert to the British consulate in Mogadore. One gets the real sense that North Africa of the early 19th century differed little from North Africa during the Middle Ages.<br /><br />This was a culture crusted in dust and ruins, thriving on the misery of and plunder extracted from less fortunate others.<br /><br />One major disappointment in this book is King's failure to include the information from Riley's original on the treatment by Muslims of non-Muslim dhimmis indigenous to these lands. Following his own emancipation, Riley wrote that he had several times visited the streets of the Jewish quarter of Mogadore.<br /><br />The Jewish people were locked into their quarter at night, and also during the payment of the annual tax. Occasionally payment was requested somewhat in advance of the due date, with the Jews left the miserable privilege, in the words of the British Consul, \\"of apportioning the tribute amongst them as they please.\\" Riley witnessed one such period. Riley never went to their streets \\"without seeing ... these miserable wretches knocked down like the bullocks by the gatekeepers, with their large canes, as they attempted to rush past them when the gates were opened\\" to obtain a bit of food or water for their hungry families.<br /><br />On the fourth day of collections, Riley went to the house of the Kaid in Mogadore to bear witness (Bat Yeor, The Dhimmi, pp. 296-297). The first three classes paid their allotment by approaching the door, removing their shoes and taking money in both hands, which they were forced to hold out before them at chest height. A \\"Mohammedan priest\\" took the taxes, \\"hitting each one a smart blow with his fist, on the bare forehead,... at which the Jew said 'Nahma Sidi [\\"at your service, master\\"]....\\" The very large and especially miserable fourth class, however, was forced forward with large sticks. Anyone who was not ready to pay, or could not, was \\"seized by the Moors, who, throwing him flat on his face to the ground, gave him about fifty blows with a thick stick upon his back and posteriors....\\" These men were then thrown in a dungeon until his friends \\"made up the money.\\" If after three days the tax had not been paid, the men were bludgeoned again.<br /><br />While I enjoyed King's rendition of this tale, I remain unconvinced that the society depicted here has changed much since 1815. I also recommend the 2000 reprint of James Riley's original, Sufferings in Africa.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

The nine chapters cover some 93 pages, and include a number of reproductions of etchings, maps and other historical illustrations. The topic is entirely the trail of tears suffered by the Jewish people at the hands of Christian Spain.<br /><br />The book's one deficiency concerns the preceding era of Muslim rule of Andalusia. It portrays this time frame, from the 8th through the 13th centuries, as one of peace, prosperity and universality.<br /><br />This, however, is a gross oversimplification, and misrepresentation. The earlier era was one of militancy and war. Spain was pillaged and burned during the 711 invasion by Tariq. Cordoba's factories alone produced 1,000 bows and 20,000 arrows a month, and 1,300 shields and 3,000 tents a year--used, according to [[ASIN:0520248406 Richard Fletcher]], to ravage the area. The supposedly learned and cultured 10th century sultan 'Abd al-Rahman owned 3,750 slaves in his palace alone. Barcelona was sacked in 985, along with the monastery at San Cugat del Valles. Combra was plundered in 987. Leon and Zamora were pumelled in 988. Osma was destroyed in 989, and so on.<br /><br />As we see, even Andalusia's supposedly ultra-harmonious 10th century was hardly that. In 977, Almanzor (meaning 'the victorious'), undertook a first campaign against Leon, which he ravaged. His 997 campaign against Santiago de Compostella was only \\"the most daring and notorious of a series of hammer-blows which the Andalusi armies under Almanzor's leadership delivered to the Christian principalities,\\" writes Fletcher. The Jews escaped none of these escapades unscathed, either.<br /><br />--Alyssa A. Lappen	2005-01-11

For that reason, the seven chapters herein chiefly set out to present Islam as unrivaled in its purity, and to outline of demands for an Islamic life. Apart from belief in one god, this requires acceptance of the &#34;unity&#34; of the Muslim community and a belief that Islam is, to quote from the Koran (Sura 3: 199) &#34;the best community to have been raised up for mankind.&#34;<br /><br />This would explain why the book was published by the Islamic Texts Society, whose purpose is to extend Islamic evangelism, or Da'wa, to all non-Muslims. In classic Islamic form, the reader is &#34;invited to discover a world,&#34; in other words, invited to convert to Islam.<br /><br />Thus Chapter 4, entitled &#34;A miracle and its progression in history,&#34; makes the ridiculous claim (through quotation from Francesco Gabrieli's Muhammad and the Arab Conquest) that &#34;No one was converted by the sword.&#34; Still more absurd (and unsubstantiated) is the claim that &#34;Arabs never presented the people they had conquered with the choice between death and the acceptance of their faith.&#34;<br /><br />On the contrary, the historical record makes precisely this pattern clear in land after land, and region after region, as denoted in such scholars as Bat Ye'or ([[ASIN:0838636780 The Decline of Eastern Christianity]] and [[ASIN:0838639429 Islam and Dhimitude]]), [[ASIN:8185689032 K.S. Lal]] and others.<br /><br />If you buy this book, do so only with the understanding that it in no way purports to be impartial or balanced. The sole purpose of this text, stated clearly at the outset, is to convert infidels and kafirs to Islam, nothing less. Moreover, misrepresenting history is part and parcel of that process.<br /><br />--Alyssa A. Lappen	2005-01-05

It's a personal account, not a history of Israel, but this book is perfect for anyone considering a major move, especially to Israel.<br /><br />Readers get a vision of the absorption process in Israel, how it feels to learn a new language, and the various adjustments necessary to feel comfortably, at home.<br /><br />Larkey covers every aspect of his life in Israel, his professional adjustment, the process of finding work as an architect for himself and a place at a school for the deaf for his wife Aviva. After working in a firm that built Jerusalem homes from the city's gorgeous stone, Larkey opened his own Jerusalem architectural office.<br /><br />His story also includes his service as a private in the Israel Defense Forces on the Sinai front during the Yom Kippur War and his later service in the IDF reserves. These are among the most exciting chapters of the book, which contains an account of personal trauma.<br /><br />Thank you Arieh Larkey for this wonderful personal account.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Naftali, to make a long, delicious story short, grew up at the feet of his father Zelig, who often told him of and imp, whose tail tasted like salt. He also grew up reading and loving stories.<br /><br />Reb Zebulin told him that even fictional stories were often true. After hearing stories that sounded completely unbelievable, Reb Zebulin would go to a place where those things had actually happened. \\"The brain is created by God,\\" he told Naftali, \\"and human thoughts and fantasies are also God's works.\\"<br /><br />Thus Naftali resolved to become a bookseller and a writer when he grew up. He could not support himself, but he met Reb Falik, who had a house built for Naftali to house all the books that he intended to bequeath him. When his horse Sus died, he marked the grave with the oak whip he never used. Several weeks later, the whip sprouted shoots and roots, much as his stories had done.<br /><br />Other tales take readers to Chelm, the village of idiots young and old. Even the people have funny names--Gronam Ox, Dopey Lekisch, Zeinvel Ninny, Shmendrick Numskull,  Feyvel Thickwit, Sender Donkey, Treitel Fool and their most foolish compatriots. For many weeks, these sages had been sitting about wondering why the town treasury was empty and they had not received their wages.<br /><br />Then 80-year-old Zalman Typpesh arrived, offering 2,000 pieces of gold if they could provide good advice as to how he could live forever. Shlemiel finally arrived at the solution: Dalfunka, a nearby suburb was where all the paupers live. He noted with great satisfaction that no rich man had ever died there. Thus, if Zalman moved to Dalfunka, he would live forever. Needless to say, he moved to Dalfunka, went broke spending money on blintzes and died--a pauper.<br /><br />To discover the details--and six more of Singer's fabled delights--you'll have to read this book.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

He would read first in English (translations by Ken McKullough) and then chant his poems a cappella in a voice as vibrant as it was heart-piercing.<br /><br />What a lowing my wife put up<br />when she gave birth to the first twin.<br />Very pretty, just as I'd wished, but those fiends<br />choked them and wrapped them in plastic.<br /><br />This stanza from \\"The Loss of My Twins\\" seared my ears as he read the clean, crisp language of loss.<br /><br />From this voice, one remarkable fact is eminently clear: Indigenous languages can be inhabited even by strangers. John O'Donohue once explained it like this, in terms which themselves danced on the edge of a poem:<br /><br />Language comes from that restless space between loneliness and experience. It lives through people, but without them as well. Poetry is travel to the inner language, and every poem is a threshold crossing between the ancient and the [now].

These were part of a mass ethnic cleansing that swept Arab regimes in the Middle East in the 1940s, 50s, 60s and 70s. Some 850,000 Jewish residents of 22 Arab lands--whose families had inhabited them for thousands of years--were robbed of homes, businesses, bank accounts and all their worldly possessions.<br /><br />The author worked with editors at Israel's financial newspaper, Globes, and Dalia Tal, Amira Liss in London, Rom Dagoni in Washington and Samir Rafaat of Egypt, to interview Jewish immigrants from Arab lands. He also supplies proof--documents and photographs from the Israel State, Central Zionist, Joint Distribution Committee and Hagana Archives and the Public Records Office in London.<br /><br />As readers learn here, Iraq's Jewish community made huge inroads into trade and banking after the Suez Canal opened in 1869. One family was so wealthy they rented their Baghdad home to King Faisal while his palace was built. During Iraq's British Mandate period, 1917-1932, for lack of qualified Muslim and Christian workers, the British hired many Jews in government ministries.<br /><br />In 1932 Iraq had 800 Jewish civil servants, 800 Jewish railway clerks, 100 Jewish employees of foreign firms and 66 Jewish bank clerks. But in 1932, three months before Hitler rose to power, Dr. Fritz Groba became Germany's Consel General to Iraq. He bought the daily newspaper, al-Allem al-Arabi, Levin writes, and began publishing an Arabic-language Mein Kampf. In 1934, dozens of Jewish government employees were fired, which was followed in 1936 with the firing of 300 Jewish senior government clerks.<br /><br />The history of Iraq was tortured and unstable from its 1932 independence forward. Faisal had favored the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine but died in September 1933. His mentally unstable son Ghazi took the throne, but died in a car crash in April 1939. Rachid Ali al-Khilani, an open admirer of Hitler's Nazi Germany, came to power,. As Levin shows, he resigned in 1941, staged a military coup three months later and was eventually toppled by Britain's army.<br /><br />Iraq's business was greatly supported by the Jewish community, however. In 1938 and 1939, 10 of Iraq's 25 richest merchant families were Jewish--including the Ades (auto importers and insurance brokers); David and Shaul Rajwan (tea traders); David Sasson (construction magnate); Abudi Kaduri Zilka (banker); Ezra Meir Lawy (car dealers); and the Shemesh brothers (tea traders).  Their success was accompanied by burgeoning hatred of Jews, according to Levin.<br /><br />By June 1941, Levin writes, \\"the notion of Jewish co-existence in Iraqi society exploded\\" with the Farhud, Iraq's version of Kristalnacht. Some 180 Jews were murdered in Baghdad alone and 240 Jews were officially reported wounded (though reports put the number at 700); 586 Jewish businesses looted and 99 Jewish homes destroyed. Nezimaa Mu'allem-Cohen recalled hearing gunfire and shouting all night long. In the morning, his father went to synagogue and returned telling his wife that Jewish homes had been burned, daughters raped, homes looted, a synagogue burned. As his father spoke, a mob broke down two doors and entered shouting and waving sticks. A shot rang out and the family's father was dead. A policeman they called for help asked, \\"How do you want to die?\\" and bashed the new widow on her head with his gun.<br /><br />Iraq's 135,000  Jews worked in trade, industry, craftsmanship and services and tried to reintegrate during World War II. But their share of Iraq's imports business fell from 80% to 50% after the war, while their share of government contracts fell by half to 5%.<br /><br />In 1948, Iraq officially instituted harsh persecution of the Jews. Police searches of homes and business became routine, complete with mass destruction of Jewish property. Families of Jews who had left Iraq between 1933 and 1949 were forced to report their property, which the state confiscated. Jewish bankers could not collect their loans, and Iraqis extorted money from Jewish neighbors on pain of informing on them to the authorities.<br /><br />In 1948, Iraq barred Jews from importing and their share of the business fell, to 20%, while their share of exports fell 60%, to 2%. In a Sept. 17, 1948 memo, which was never sent, Iraq's persecuted Jewish leaders complained that the regime's actions closely mirrored those of Hitler. One 1948 parliamentary candidate had delivered this one-sentence speech: \\"Heil Hitler, choose me, I am an enemy of the Jews.\\" In April 1949, 103 Jews were sentenced to death or imprisonment for such ludicrous charges as  disseminating \\"libelous information,\\" possessing \\"a Jewish New Year's card, imprinted with the Star of David,\\" creating \\"Zionist propaganda,\\" sabotage of \\"a telegraph machine\\" and so on.<br /><br />On March 2, 1950, Jews remaining in Iraq congregated in their synagogues on Purim to learn that a Parliamentary law would allow them to leave--but would also strip them permanently of their citizenship and everything they owned. Jews in Iraq, like the Jews of Germany, had become officially \\"an unwanted element.\\" Jews were rounded up, shorn of all their goods, harassed, starved and otherwise abused.

He reports his ideological transformation on Kibbutz Lahav in 1970, his course from Labor Zionism to the \\"new left\\" at Hebrew University, from which he migrated to Trotskyite anti-Zionism and Maoism and concluded, \\"I was no longer a Zionist.\\" An admitted Marxist, Beinin has for 30 years vigorously opposed \\"the Zionist project.\\"<br /><br />As a consequence, this book is not history. Rather, it accepts facts only for ideological use. No subject escapes unharmed. Like his prior books, this one attempts to advance Marxism while denigrating Jews, Judaism--and Israel.<br /><br />Beinin claims that Israeli and Egyptian \\"political considerations\\" prevented Jewish refugees from telling their story. Yet he dismisses bona fide histories produced by refugees like [[ASIN:0838639437 Bat Ye'or]] and [[ASIN:0878551689 Yehoshafat]] [[ASIN:0853032009 Harkabi]] as gloomy \\"neo-lachrymose interpretation.\\" They're accurate.<br /><br />The author counts these historians worthless because their work (he says) carries the \\"imprimatur of...Israel, the Zionist movement, world Jewry, and...normative Zionist interpretation\\" --- and purportedly diminish Palestinian claims. By this flawed logic, only Arabs or anti-Zionists could accurately report on 1 million Jewish refugees forced from their homes in Arab lands, while Jewish victims must remain in perpetual silence.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, given his own bias, Beinin minimizes Egyptian anti-Semitism too. He dismisses pervasive Egyptian media ridicule of Jewish leaders during the 1940s, 50s and 60s. It is not \\"an expression of primordial Arab or Muslim anti-Jewish sentiment.\\"<br /><br />Beinin likewise dismisses the waves of false arrests to which [[ASIN:0962005223 Egyptian Karaite]] and other Jews were subjected in the 1940s, 1950s and 60s. He claims this was not anti-Semitism, either. He cites rabbinic denunciations of Zionism, made under duress, as \\"proof\\" that Egyptian Jews were not Zionists and claims that Jewish leaders \\"shamelessly exploited\\" and \\"grossly exaggerated\\" Egypt's \\"Nazi-like anti-Semitism.\\"<br /><br />Nevertheless, the facts are: Egypt's government frequently published hateful tracts like Shawki Abdel Nasser's Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the Teachings of the Talmud. Moreover, former Nazis and SS officials seamlessly joined Egypt's government, and had huge influence. They were welcomed with open arms, since Egypt was anti-Semitic to start --- and fertile ground to further propagate Nazi ideology co-morbid with their own.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

But it is questionable whether any one group of people can claim to have a monopoly on an interpretation of divinity. It is further questionable whether any one group should try to dictate its will and interpretations of divine law on all of humankind.<br /><br />Very basic laws of society such as prohibitions against murder, theft and violations of human rights may be interpretations of divine law. But beyond those, how ethical is it to assume that a whole way of thinking should be, as it were, codified for all? Isn't diversity the spice of life?<br /><br />Be that as it may, one finds such a plan put forward in this book on, as its title suggests, how to Islamicize North America. In the opening essay, Jamal Barzinji refers briefly to past Islamic scholars who called for reform in the Muslim community (ummah), based on \\"mastery of both religious Islamic disciplines and wordly secular disciplines.\\" This is by way of examining \\"what went wrong\\" in Islamic history, which various groups concluded was merely symptomatic of \\"the crisis in its thought.\\"<br /><br />Thus the Islamist Muslim Students Association of America and Canada founded an Association of Muslim Social Scientists, and in November 1977 convened the First International Conference on Islamization of Knowledge in Switzerland. This was followed by a second conference of the same name in Islamabad in 1983, a third in Kuala Lampur in 1984. and a fourth in Khartoum in 1987.

Adding to Efraim Karsh's 1996 study ([[ASIN:071468063X Fabricating Israeli History]]), she reminds readers that Morris failed to reply. He ignored 50 Karsh references to his own work, Avi Shlaim, primary sources and major historical and journalistic studies.<br /><br />In this work, Morris ironically refers to many of Karsh's sources, but nevertheless arrives at incorrect conclusions. The book is thus a politically charged revision of the Israeli-Arab conflict covering the pre-1948 through the history of Arab wars on Israel. The book shows culprits and casualties, and blames Arab regimes for violent incursions into Israel in the 1950s, for the secret war between Israel and terrorist groups, for Naser's threat to Israel before the Sinai and Six-Day wars, and for many Arab calls for Israel's destruction. Moreover, while Morris notes that Israel's West Bank and Gaza rule &#34;was never as restrictive or repressive as the Palestinians made out,&#34;--which is certainly true--in this book, he nevertheless misconstrues the greater part of fact and history.<br /><br />One big problem is Morris' large reliance on Israeli and secondary sources. He consults only a few primary Arab documents (and those, only in English translation), thus all but ignoring available Arab memoirs and state files. Oddly, Morris exploits every Israeli contingency plan and idea as conclusive evidence of Zionist expansionism, but ignores Arab plans for a &#34;Greater Syria&#34; as well as King Hussein's designs.<br /><br />Another is Morris' exclusion of regional effects of the cold war, and Soviet arms that poured into Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and other Arab states, worsening Arab-Israeli relations from the 1950s on. In short, Morris ignores the fact that the opportunity for Arab-Israeli peace opened up only following the collapse of the Soviet Union, which left Arab hard-liners without support for their traditional rejections.<br /><br />Worse, Morris misconstrues the notorious topic of &#34; transfer,&#34; a term commonly used between the two world wars to describe population exchanges like that between Turkey and Greece in the 1920s. In his first work on that topic, Morris rightly concluded that the &#34;Palestinian refugee problem was born of war, not by design, Jewish or Arab,&#34; but was (rather) a by-product of both people's fears and the protracted, bitter fighting of the first Arab-Israeli war. But that conclusion provoked attacks from Arab historians and Israeli revisionists.<br /><br />Whatever the reason, Morris in this book reverses his earlier conclusion, standing history on its head. He makes effect into cause, and falsely translates the results of war into a paradigm for Arab-Jewish relations. He writes, &#34;fear of territorial displacement and dispossession was to be the chief motor of Arab antagonism to Zionism down to 1948 (and indeed after 1967 as well).&#34;<br /><br />This reading libels Zionism and its foundations.<br /><br />Actually, the Peel Commission first proposed in 1937,  to transfer the Arab minority from territory designated for the tiny Jewish state as part of a planned partition of western Palestine into Jewish and Arab states (as noted in [[ASIN:0415287162 Israel's Wars]] and [[ASIN:1566638267 The Closed Circle]] among other volumes). Morris presumes that Zionist leaders &#34;played a role in persuading the Peel Commission to adopt the transfer solution.&#34; But he provides zero proof.<br /><br />In fact, Ben-Gurion welcomed the British idea only to persuade Zionists to accept a tiny Jewish state (and the proposed partition)--but also warned of its inherent dangers. Furthermore, Zionist leaders believed that a Jewish majority would come from massive immigration, and that Western Palestine could accommodate millions of Jews and Arabs. History proved them right on that score, although the peace they expected remains ever-elusive.<br /><br />The Arabs initiated war in 1948 in preference to accepting a Jewish state--and thought they could win. And everywhere they prevailed, Arabs expelled every last Jew. Benny Morris should get real.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

People now hunger for the horrible personal details of life during the Holocaust, as if by learning they can somehow heal the hole in the heart of the world. In the 1970s, rare was the survivor willing to reopen fresh wounds, to expose their hidden pain--and few wanted to hear.<br /><br />But Anya Brodman, who died in 1996, relived her nightmare in hours and hours of interviews with Susan Fromberg Schaeffer. Although presented as a \\"novel,\\" the story is largely Anya's--every gory detail, conversation and dream.<br /><br />Among the many horrors Anya witnessed was the murder of an  11-month-old child, Lutig Klatchko, whose death is depicted in the epilogue. (According to Schaeffer, Anya signed a non-disclosure agreement with her in exchange for a share of the royalties.)<br /><br />The book reads brilliantly and is hard to put down. \\"This is Anya's story,\\" says a close friend who heard her story dozens of times 20 years before the novel's appearance. Every detail seems real, because most of it really happened.<br /><br />Anya's idyllic life in the Vilna school-turned-apartment building, in which Lutig's mother was her neighbor, her vacations in Zakopanie, marriage to Stajoe, life in Warsaw and return to Vilna, her imprisonment in the ghetto, the birth of her child, her incarceration, survival and eventual escape from Kaiserwald, near Riga.<br /><br />Anya was lucky. She saved herself and her daughter Ninka. Soon after that, her friends were shipped to a far worse prison, a death camp called Stuthoff, near Danzig. Most perished.<br /><br />Of Anya's friends, the relative handful who survived had no other family left. They lost parents, grandparents, spouses, children, cousins, everyone. Following the death of Lutig's mother last January, only one remains.<br /><br />--Alyssa A. Lappen	2004-12-27

I was not wrong. As history books go, this one has had an extraordinary run, and it is must reading for anyone who wants to understand the true genesis of the current situation in the Middle East.<br /><br />Oren rooted through boxes and boxes of declassified Presidential and U.S. State Department documents, as well as those of various Arab and Israeli government offices. What he found puts new historians like Avi Shlaim and Benny Morris to shame.<br /><br />We knew, of course, that the Soviets in the 1950s and 1960s copiously supplied arms to Egypt, Syria, Jordan and others of the Arab nations. But Oren also shows that the Soviet government in 1966 and 1967 meddled more dangerously. For example, top Soviet officials spread false \\"intelligence\\" to Arab governments about alleged Israeli plans for a massive onslaught. Oren shows that Israeli restraint before the war actually encouraged the cataclysmic Arab aggression which followed.<br /><br />Sound familiar? We can draw lessons from Oren's impressive history. Appeasing tyrants and offering more land to people who do not want peace is not the solution. I don't know what is. But this fantastic piece of historical investigation shows that recycling the same tired old formulas simply will not work.<br /><br />--Alyssa A. Lappen	2004-12-20

It makes no reasonable effort to provide points of view outside those of the perpetrators presented here.<br /><br />The book profiles such figures as Pyongyang-born Kim Hyon Hui, who on Nov. 28, 1987 destroyed Korean Air Flight 858, loaded with passengers bound for Seoul; Leila Khaled, a Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine hijacker with \\"great hatred of the Jews;\\" and Red Brigade kidnapper Susan Ronconni, whose group murdered former Italian premier Aldo Moro.<br /><br />The book parrots their words, and romances their actions as well as the indoctrination of children to hatred and war. MacDonald observes children taught to throw stones at the age of two as adorable resisters, not the examples of parental and societal abuse that they are. She presents unconfirmed reports of Israeli \\"abuse\\" without skepticism and pronounces these women \\"extraordinary,\\" rendering both the reports and the book suspect.<br /><br />This 1991 book provides an early view of all that is wrong with the Western press corps. Now, reporters go even further, and use every euphemism in the dictionary for people who purposely target civilians. They are terrorists, not \\"militants\\" or \\"activists.\\"<br /><br />Presenting female killers as normal or even worthy blurs the lines between acceptable and unacceptable. I see nothing normal about their sentiments and nothing glamorous about their desire to inflict pain and suffering on innocents, be they Korean, German--or Israeli.<br /><br />The author presents the transparent anti-Semitism of those insisting they \\"do not hate Jews, only Israelis\\" without comment. Carried to its logical conclusion, this view denies the Jewish people alone among peoples and nations the right to self-determination.<br /><br />Sorry, but this book flunks journalism 101.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

His journey into a double life, as Kamel Amin Tabet, began innocently enough in spring, 1960, when a gentleman from the Israeli defense department visited him in his accounting office at Central Distributors.<br /><br />As a Jew from Egypt, Cohn had suffered his share of hardships, and was forced in 1955 to leave the country with nothing. Two of his friends had been hanged. Now, however, he embarked upon a trip to Argentina, where he played the role of an expatriate Syrian businessman, and soon ingratiated himself with a series of Arab emissaries, including Amin Al-Hafez, who later became Syria's Ba'athist president.<br /><br />By 1964, Elie Cohn was in Syria, where he worked his way up in the elite, nearly making it into the role of a Syrian minister. Cohn learned of all the military plans of Israel's grave enemy, sworn to destroy the Jewish state. Always ready with wine, women and funds for the greedy Syrian leadership cliques, Cohn obtained visits to secret army installations overlooking Israel's borders, and learned of nefarious plans. In the early mornings, he telegraphed the details to Israel on equipment smuggled in via baksheesh.<br /><br />When Cohn was finally caught in early 1965, he was close to becoming a Syrian government minister. Now, his erstwhile friend El-Hafez showed himself a brutal tyrant, denying all international appeals for clemency. After a kangaroo trial, Elie Cohn was hanged in a public square, where his body swung for six hours to appease the Syrian appetite for Jewish blood. The world community was shocked, and equally horrified by Syria's refusal even to return Cohn's body to his family in Israel.<br /><br />The outcome is known before one even begins this 140-page real-life thriller. Still, one cannot stop turning the pages. The book is easily read in a single sitting, but the emotional impact is as great as that of many masterwork novels. Readers will not leave this sitting with dry eyes. Here was a man who courageously gave his life to save the lives of others.<br /><br />I have rarely read so moving or heroic an account.

This is less journalism than travelogue, thereby doing a disservice to the Kurdish people.<br /><br />Also, it wouldn't be Christopher Hitchens without some witless stab at the Jewish people and Zionism, and so here we have the obligatory fallacy that  the Jewish people of Iraq bombed their own synagogues so as to drive people into Israel: a falsehood as large as the one charging the Jewish people with planning their own demise in the Holocaust so as to invent a home in their ancient, much-conquered land of Israel. He also derives the zany notion that there was no anti-Semitism in Iraq before Israel's establishment.

Most public places--including hotels, restaurants, churches, movie theaters, parks--were open only to whites. On buses, only seats in the back rows were available to them, even if the front of the bus was empty.<br /><br />But as the author explains in her endnote, the board of Nashville's public library in the late 1950s voted to fully integrate, and opened the main downtown branch fully to all. Like Andrew Carnegie, whose wealth helped to build it, her grandmother considered the library more exciting, interesting, informative than any place else. Her grandmother made it into a \\"doorway to freedom.\\"<br /><br />This is a fictionalized story of the author's youth--an afternoon on which the main character, Tricia Ann, took a bus from home to downtown and the public library. She encountered much hatred en route, but she also met some love. She gave up her seat to a friend of her mother when the rear section was full. Mrs. Granell called after her, \\"Carry yo'self proud.\\"<br /><br />Her friend Jimmy Lee instructed her, \\"Don't let those signs steal yo' happiness,\\" and another gentleman at the Southland Hotel told her she resembled an angel from heaven.

It attempts to play on a problem that has plagued the Jewish people throughout history. The Arabs of Palestine have certainly been victimized. But unlike the Jews, who have consistently been victimized by others, the Arabs can legitimately blame only their own misguided leaders for their predicament. The supreme irony in the book's audacious subtitle is that its authors dare to accuse others of sins they have themselves committed many times over in this book.<br /><br />Rashid Khalidi especially claims that the population of Palestine was overridden by Europeans. But this is false: In 1554 the land was populated by [[ASIN:0819124044 205,000 Moslems]], Christians and Jews, whose numbers reached only [[ASIN:0861932099 275,000 by 1800]]. Records from 1830, 1863, 1878 and 1893 and 1917 show that when the heaviest Jewish immigration began in 1880, a large proportion of the 425,000 to 440,000 Arabs in Palestine were themselves [[ASIN:0878559647 recent immigrants]].<br /><br />Palestine fellaheen, urban dwellers and Bedouin were thinned and forced out by Ibrahim Pasha's 1831 invasion, a great 1837 earthquake and successive epidemics. In 1880, the Arabs in Israel were mostly Egyptians who settled in large numbers in Akko (6,000 in 1831 alone), Jaffa (in 1893, the majority) and the Beit Shean, Jordan and Hula Valleys. Through World War I, Arab and Muslim immigrants also came from Algeria, Damascus, Yemen, Afghanistan, Persia, India, Tripoli, Morocco, Turkey, Iraq, Algeria (whose immigrants spoke Berber), and the Caucasus, despite numerous hardships that were offset by Palestine's booming economy.<br /><br />These essays ignore all those nasty facts, attempting to prove prove that the Jewish people always planned to expel the Arabs of Palestine. The reading is imposed on a situation and history that shows no such thing.<br /><br />Then we move on to Edward Said, who misrepresents the writings of Theodore Herzl. The latter devoted twenty pages of his June 12, 1895 diary entry to reflections on the problem. Said quotes Herzl as saying that &#34;both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly,&#34;[45] and that &#34;we shall try to spirit the penniless population across the border by procuring employment in our own country.&#34;<br /><br />Actually, Herzl refers neither to economic nor physical force. Furthermore, before and after these seemingly damning statements are others that substantially mitigate the &#34;intent&#34; that Said hopes to &#34;prove.&#34;<br /><br />Herzl wrote that upon occupying the land, the Jewish people &#34;shall bring immediate benefits to the state that receives us. We must expropriate gently the private property on the estates assigned to us.&#34; (Herzl, Complete Diaries, Vol. 1, p.88). In other words, the Jewish people would BUY the land. In the 19th century, the Jewish people were buying land at prices considerably above-market--and &#34;expropriating&#34; land ONLY via purchase. Thus, Herzl proves the righteousness of the effort and great sensitivity to others.<br /><br />Second, Herzl afterwards wrote that it went without saying, &#34;we shall respectfully tolerate persons of other faiths and protect their property, their honor, and their freedom.&#34; He added that the &#34;harshest means&#34; would be used against all persons who abused the rights of others. He intended to &#34;set the entire old order a wonderful example,&#34; (Ibid), which is precisely what the Jewish people did.<br /><br />Far from admitting Said's charge, namely &#34;to a policy of systematic ethnic cleansing,&#34; Herzl promised to violently oppose anyone who might harm any people already living in the land.<br /><br />Several exceedingly thorough scholars have already studied the false (albeit politically charged) purpose of this set of authors: Bernard Lewis (Islam and the West); Efraim Karsh ([[ASIN:071468063X Fabricating Israeli History]]); Erich and Rael Jean Isaac (&#34;Whose Palestine?&#34; Commentary, July, 1986); Justus Reid Wiener (Commentary, Sept., 1999); and Werner Cohn (&#34;[[ASIN:0964589702 Partners in Hate]],&#34; online).<br /><br />These are the facts, whereas each essay in this book is nothing more than a tissue of lies.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

But few other nations can legitimately claim to be more perfect. That an Israeli penned this book only proves that Israelis are often their own worst enemies.<br /><br />The book lacks perspective, least of all Israel's continued isolation in a sea of largely hostile Arab nations armed to the teeth. It therefore exploits a Jewish propensity to feel guilt even when none is required.<br /><br />What perspective? By comparison to the United Nations, Israel is moral, kind--and far less brutal. In 1993, for example, the UN killed more than 750 demonstrating Somalis with AC-130 helicopter gunships and tanks within five months--including more than 60 in June, 20 shot by Pakistani troops, 73 in July, 100 in September and 500 in a 14-hour battle on October 3. Thousands were wounded. UN troops were far more violent than Israel in similar circumstances, yet blamed insurgents for the lethal results-just like British UN troops who fired plastic bullets and used tanks in Mitrovica to quell riots of stone- and bomb-throwing ethnic Albanians.<br /><br />One would expect Ezrahi to compare Israel's actions to those of the UN and Western troops. But one finds no such comparison here; readers must turn to others like Mark Bowden (Black Hawk Down) for accounts of the Somali and other episodes.<br /><br />Ezrahi doesn't even put the Israeli response to Arab violence into the context of other surrounding nations, which are also far more brutal. In the Sudan, a Muslim government enslaves some 15,000 Christians and animists and murders 1,000 weekly in a jihad genocide that has already taken more than 2 million lives. Why does Ezrahi single out Israel, without noting the actions of other far-more-egregious governments in the same region?<br /><br />Ezrahi could also have juxtaposed Israel's actions with those of Saudi Arabia and Jordan. In 1987 Saudi officials marred the annual hajj by killing more than 275 unarmed Iranian pilgrims who had hoped to take over Mecca's Grand Mosque and force clerics to declare Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini the leader of all Muslims. (Iran claimed the death toll was 600.) And in 1970, Jordan's King Husein ordered an assault on the Palestine Liberation Organization that razed the al-Wahdat and Husayni refugee camps near Amman nearly to the ground. In 10 days, at least 3,400 were slaughtered, a number Arafat put at 20,000.<br /><br />Had Ezrahi compared Israel's &#34;brutishness&#34; to that of other nations, he could have reached legitimate conclusions.

In late 1989, Gretchen and Bob Passantino and Jon Trott exposed Lauren Stratford as Laurel Willson in an article in Cornerstone, still available on the web.<br /><br />By 1998, Willson had morphed into a \\"Holocaust survivor.\\" Some time earlier, she presented herself as Laura Grabowski to a group of child Holocaust survivors, who accepted her claim to be a Polish Jew, a survivor of Auschwitz-Birkenau and a victim of Dr. Joseph Mengele. She pretended to have been liberated to a Krakow orphanage in 1945 and brought to the United States, where a Gentile couple adopted her at nine or ten. In 1998, her poem \\"We Are One\\" appeared on the web. But like the story here, this appears to have been completely untrue.<br /><br />In 1997, Willson/Stratford contacted  Binjamin Wilkomirski with her story. He had published Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood in Europe in 1995. Schocken Books translated and published his story in the U.S. In 1997. Then in 1999, 60 Minutes broadcast a segment on Wilkomirski: He seemed to have been born in Switzerland as Bruno Grosjean, and later adopted and renamed Bruno Dossekker. Also in 1999, Philip Gourevitch wrote on Wilkomirski in The New Yorker, as did Elena Lappin in Granta. All three outfits believed Dossekker/Wilkomirski's story to be false.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Willson/Stratford, she had already wound herself tightly to the Dossekker/Wilkomirski story: She claimed to be Lauren Grabowski, whom she said had known him in a Krakow orphanage. He, in turn, used Grabowski to corroborate his story. But the respective publications in 2001 and 2002 of [[ASIN:0805211357 The Wilkomirski Affair]] (Stefan Maechler) and [[ASIN:0393324451 A Life in Pieces: The Making and Unmaking of Binjamin Wilkomirski]] (Blake Eskin) blew her cover as well.<br /><br />Gretchen and Bob Passantino and Jon Trott revisited the Willson/Stratford story laid out in this book in Cornerstone in October 1999 (also still on the web). This time, they discussed her apparent fakery as Grabowski, and suggested that Grabowski was actually an American Christian who since her youth had fabricated stories about her alleged victimhood, the most well-publicized case being in this book.<br /><br />Alas, Dossekker/Wilkomirski's unraveling also involved that of Stratford, whose Social Security number, according to Maechler, is one and the same as that of Grabowski, the claimed survivor.

These ideas are ridiculous.<br /><br />Why it took the British until 1948 to leave, Segev does not explain. As to voluminous evidence that the British stirred up Arab nationalism and the anti-Semitic revolt and joined in fighting the Arab's first war against Israel (as accounted by Col. R. Meinertzhagen, Samuel Katz, and many others), Segev keeps silent. Nor does he note that British general John Glubb commanded the Transjordanian army.<br /><br />Segev asks political questions. 1) Why did the British conquer Palestine? 2) Why did they commit in 1917 to establish a Jewish National Home? 3) Why did they stay in Palestine? 4) Why did the British leave?<br /><br />But Segev derides official British papers as too tiresome and voluminous to read. Segev bases his conclusions entirely on gleanings from diaries, personal letters, articles and books written by local Britons, Arabs and Jews, none previously consulted by historians--probably because they describe the social scene, not politics. The resultant fiction on Mandatory Palestine repeats the old Arnold Toynbee canard that Britain promised Palestine twice.<br /><br />This conclusion is also ridiculous: Better accounts (which Segev ignores) are provided by scholars like Howard Sachar ([[ASIN:0375711325 History of Israel]]); Efraim Karsh ([[ASIN:0674005414 Empires of the Sand]]); Elie Kedourie ([[ASIN:1566635616 The Chatham House Version]]); David Fromkin ([[ASIN:0805068848 A Peace to End All Peace]]) and Conor C. O'Brien ([[ASIN:0671600443 The Siege]]); Samuel Katz ([[ASIN:0929093135 Battleground]]) and Bat Ye'or ([[ASIN:0838639429 Islam and Dhimitude: Where Civilizations Collide]]).<br /><br />The worst aspect of Segev's work is his failure to note that Britain's conquest of Palestine was part of a calculated political and military strategy to establish a land bridge between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. This, the British intended to enable their rapid deployment of troops to the Gulf, defend the Empire's vast East Indian interests, protect their territories from Russian invasion, and to provide an alternative to and protection of Egypt's Suez Canal. Segev claims that \\"[The British] gave [Palestine] to the Zionists because they loved 'the Jews' even as they loathed them\\" and feared them. He also posits that the British were guided something other than strategic considerations, and lacked an \\"orderly decision-making process.\\" (p. 33) Good grief. Even if this were true (which it isn't) Segev hardly disproves the importance of the land bridge as the driving force behind British policy.<br /><br />Segev also minimizes the importance and effect of Britain's 1939 White Paper, which slowed immigration of Jews to Palestine--mandated by the League of Nation in 1922, with international support--to a trickle. Britain trapped Europe's Jews inside Nazi-controlled Europe, denying them their one viable escape hatch. Segev, however, suggests that the White Paper had no practical result, since even the quota established was not filled. But how could it have been filled, when obtaining papers became so difficult in the aftermath of the White Paper? Honestly.<br /><br />The White Paper exponentially increased the difficulty to European Jews of getting immigration papers, according to account after Holocaust survivor account, as well as work by esteemed Holocaust scholars such as David Wyman (Abandonment of the Jews). Besides refusing to consider a plan to save Europe's Jews, the British deployed 100,000 troops and a large armada in Palestine and the Mediterranean to capture Jews escaping from Europe and return them to that hell--policies the White Paper spelled out. Britain intended to limit Jewish immigration, and did so very effectively.<br /><br />Once Britain opened Palestine Mandate and foreign office records, decades later, historians discovered that all correspondences concerning wartime immigration into Palestine, among other items, had mysteriously disappeared. In other words, Segev discounts the fact that British officials, obviously mortified post facto by their inhumane actions in 1939 and after, destroyed all especially damning evidence. Segev ignores the fact that the British in London and Palestine well understood the effects of their White Paper policy on European Jews. Segev's thesis does not square with the facts.<br /><br />Segev also gives short shrift to the 7-nation Arab attack on Israel upon her 1948 founding, belying the Arab intention to destroy the Jewish state. Arab League Secretary General Azzam Pasha in 1948 promised \\"a war of extermination,\\" \\"a momentous massacre\\" to be remembered \\"like the Mongolian massacres and the Crusades\\"-and gruesome acts followed. Israel lost 6,373 persons in the war, more than twice Arab losses--and nearly 1% of her population. Of these Israeli casualties, 600 were noncombatants abused, mutilated beyond recognition and decapitated by Arab captors, who were assisted by British military aide and blockades that turned a blind eye to illegal Arab gun-running.<br /><br />Segev doesn't concern himself with the violence that preceded the 1947-8 war, who started hostilities--or why. He doesn't ask who needed to mount defenses or state the casualties on both sides. These is nothing here concerning British participation on the Arab side. In 1947, Israel accepted partition of less than 20% of the land allotted by the League of Nations in 1922 as a National Home for the Jews, while the Arabs begrudged Israel even that.<br /><br />Much as I love books, this is one that deserves to be heaved out with the bathwater.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Lest anyone lionize him as a hero, Baer exposes the terrorist trails that converged at Arafat's feet; Baer deemed him an eminently unworthy Nobel laureate.<br /><br />Baer undoubtedly risked his life often. He learned that PLO or Force 17 operatives were involved in virtually every major terrorist attack in the last two decades, Baer alleges that a trail might even have led from Arafat to Osama bin Laden, had it been followed. In any case, he notes that by the mid-1990s, the CIA had stopped following good leads. His well-developed and frightening point: As the Cold War waned, the CIA quickly transformed into a politically correct bureaucracy, more interested in promoting corporate and big oil interests than gathering critical intelligence.<br /><br />That's too bad, because as a Middle East operative, Baer picked up great information on Arafat. Born in Cairo as Muhammad 'Abd al-Rauf Arafat al-Qudwa in 1929, Baer writes, Arafat hails from the same prominent Huysayni clan that spawned Jerusalem Mufti Hajj Amin el-Huysayni, indicted at Nuremberg for World War II war crimes.<br /><br />After studying at University of Cairo, Baer reports, Arafat became a second lieutenant in Egypt's army, joined Egypt's Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, and never renounced ties the violent sects. Arrested for sedition, Arafat fled to Kuwait and founded Fateh in the 1950s, drawing members from the Muslim Brotherhood and Palestinian Arabs; he soon actively assumed a violent role.<br /><br />Therefore, Baer writes, Arafat never earned the trust of other Arab leaders. In 1977, he joined the Middle Eastern fundamentalist tide, asking Abu Jihad to organize Fateh into an umbrella Committee of 77. Through Student Cells, Arafat recruited fundamentalist Munir Shafiq Asal who in turn brought in young Palestinian and Lebanese Arabs, including 'Imad Fa'iz Mughniyah.<br /><br />It was Mughniyah, a Shi'a Muslim from southern Lebanon, who according to Baer kidnapped Beirut CIA chief William Buckley on March 16, 1984. He also negotiated with Arafat in Tunis for the release of four Soviet diplomats kidnapped in Beirut in September 1985, and earned $200,000 from PLO security chief Abu Iyad for the favor. (Buckley died in captivity.)<br /><br />Bear discovered Mughaniyah's links to Hizballah and Iran's Pasdaran, the latter headed by Ali Saleh Shamkhani, now Iran's defense minister. He discovered Mughaniyah's ties to the Dec. 25, 1986 hijacking of an Iraqi airliner, which crashed in Saudi Arabia, killing everyone aboard.<br /><br />According to Baer another Fateh commander, Azmi Sughayr, ordered the April 18, 1983 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut that killed 63, including 17 Americans and six CIA officers. Sughayr intended to kill Ambassador John Habib and hired PLO operative Mohammed Na'if Jada to give the signal for the explosive-laden pickup to hit the embassy compound. (Happily, Habib was not in the embassy. Jada survived was arrested.)<br /><br />Baer also reports Sughayr's ties to Iran:  Jada was released and traveled to Dubai where he connected with Anis Abdullah Hassan (Abu Ali), the head of a Fateh cell in the Gulf. Abu Ali worked for Abd-Al-Latif Salah, in turn an associate of Arafat's in the Iranian Islamic Jihad Organization. In 1983, bomber Muhammad Hassuna left Lebanon, ostensibly to fight with Iran against Iraq, but is assumed to have driven the deadly truck.<br /><br />Baer also reports that Arafat supported the 1982 Muslim Brotherhood insurrection against Syria's Hafiz Al-Asad. In June 1983, Asad retaliated with a full-scale counter-attack in Hama, after which Arafat evacuated 4,000 followers from Tripoli on five Greek ships to Tunis. Sughayr stayed behind to lead Iranian-backed terrorists, including Ali Dib (aka Khudur Salamah) and Abd Al-Latif Salah, a Jordan-born Palestinian Fateh member.<br /><br />Sughayr joined Fateh's Force 17 predecessor in 1969, fought Jordan for Arafat in 1970, and the Fateh Black September terrorist organization in 1971. Sughayr was named head of the PLO Security Office for Foreign Operations in 1973 and very likely participated in the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Fateh member Husayn 'Ali Husayn Jawad Khalil also worked for Azmi Sughayr. Khalil was the brother-in-law to senior Hizballah agent 'Ali 'Ammar, and kidnapped ABC correspondent Charles Glass on orders from Iranian Pasdaran chief Husayn Al-Musawi, whom Baer discovered to have seized the Shaykkh Abdullah barracks. He imprisoned CIA chief Bill Buckley where the latter died.<br /><br />Bear notes that Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution was largely \\"suckled on the Palestinian teat.\\"<br />Indeed, Arafat signed a 1972 deal with Ayatollah Khomeini in Najaf--to train Fateh Islamic fighters in southern Lebanon camps. Virtually all the Iranian revolutionary leaders passed through these camps, we learen, including Khomeini's son Ahmad and Pasdaran commander.Mustafa Chamran  On Khomeini's his return to Iran, Arafat was first to call in congratulations. Nine months later, Arafat flew to Teheran to greet Khomeini personally.<br /><br />Arafat ordered Fateh to give the Iranian revolution full assistance. He also commanded the February 1980 attempted assassination of former Iranian prime minister Shapour Bakhtiar in Paris. Furthermore, Mughniyah and Ali Dib masterminded the April 5, 1988 hijacking of Kuwait Airlines Flight 422, in which two hostages were murdered.<br /><br />Baer also believes that Arafat's Iranian-backed terrorists arranged the December 1988 Pan Am disaster over Lockerbie Scotland.<br /><br />In 1996, Baer reports that the CIA refused to let him gather information from a source close to Tajik chieftain Abdullah Nuri. Baer rightly regrets this major CIA oversight, since Nuri had just allied with Osama bin Laden and Iranian intelligence.<br /><br />These are but a few aspects of this extraordinary insiders' account.

Porath adds to the Oct. 1995 and April 1990 discussions by Robert Satloff and Shabtai Teveth in Middle Eastern Studies and to Efraim Karsh's  excellent book, [[ASIN:071468063X Fabricating Israeli History]]. Don't read this book without looking at these critiques.<br /><br />Why? Morris et al tell readers they have written &#34;new&#34; history of Israel, considering the entire previous historical record as if it were solely propaganda for the Zionist cause. Here, Morris considers Jewish conduct in the 1947 and 1948, and why the Arabs fled.<br /><br />Morris claims to be the first person to have looked at Israeli archives on the Dalet Plan, a plan to move populations in certain areas. Nevertheless, other scholars show that Morris and his peers in this book misrepresent themselves and the facts.<br /><br />Firstly, Yigael Alon and Israel Galili, in The Book of the Palmah, gave Walid Khalidi material to argue in 1959 that the Dalet Plan was &#34;the master plan of the Zionists&#34; to expel Palestinians wholesale. Furthermore, Uri Millstein's 1973 History of the Hagana included the entire Dalet Plan text. Official or not, these 1959 and 1973 Israeli Jewish histories, very shortly after the the 1948 war, did not hide what happened, as Morris claims here. Furthermore, [[ASIN:0761807217 Uri Millstein]] also revisited the topic in his five-volume History of the War of Independence.<br /><br />Morris also writes that Arab government archives were closed to his research and and to other historians writing on the Israeli-Arab conflict before him. He writes that he relied on Israeli and Western archives. But Porath, Karsh, Satloff and Teveth all show that this is not the case.<br /><br />Furthermore, Morris did no research at the Hagannah archives or those of the IDF, a fact underlined by Efraim Karsh in 2002, and one which he admits in a more recent book (The War for Palestine). Morris now writes that in the mid 1980s both those archives were closed to all researchers after all. He writes, he was limited to few first-hand military materials, indicating that there is no &#34;new&#34; research here at all.<br /><br />Morris' charge that Israel carried out a deliberate and systematic expulsion of the Palestinian Arabs isn't even remotely substantiated by extensive research done since the mid 1980s. On the contrary, Morris takes material very selectively, from Israeli archive fringes and makes what Porath terms &#34;outrageously false claims&#34;-- that Israel's victory resulted from &#34;an imperialist conspiracy or an overwhelming advantage in manpower and arms.&#34;<br /><br />Indeed, Morris writes here that Arabs left Israel because of many factors, their departure was not the fault of the Jewish people alone. Then, he contradicts himself, giving those who hate Israel grounds to blame Israel for the exodus, without considering the other circumstances.<br /><br />This book also details a so-called &#34;massacre&#34; in 1948 of Arabs at the village of Deir Yassin, but not enough to mention that the incident was actually a battle--in which most Arabs killed (like those in Jenin in March and April 2002) were armed.<br /><br />Finally, Morris does not note (by comparison) other massacres in 1948--of Jews, by Arabs. On December 30, 1947, for example, Arabs murdered some 50 Jewish co-workers at the Haifa refinery. On April 13, 1948, they massacred over 80 Jewish doctors, nurses and Hebrew University workers on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem.<br /><br />Additionally, nearly all of the 131 people who surrendered at the Etzion Bloc were also murdered by Palestinian Arabs. Only two survived.<br /><br />These latter Arab massacres of Jews do not fit the blame that Morris seeks to lay at Jewish feet. Nor does the fact that Jews did not afterward flee, as occurred on the Arab side following the battle at DeirYassin. So Morris omits them.<br /><br />I also find it disturbing that the book nowhere mentions the equal refugee claim of [[ASIN:0826447643 1 million Jewish]] refugees from 22 Arab nations, who were expelled with nothing but the shirts on [[ASIN:0275971341 their backs]], and rebuilt their lives in Israel, the U.S., and Europe.<br /><br />The number of Jewish refugees was actually larger than that of Arab refugees (counting only those who fled, not their descendants).

Islam means submission --- that, is, making others submit to the will of Allah. Armstrong does not cover that Islamic characteristic. The book also omits the early Islamic history of massacring infidels, which Armstrong quickly glosses over, as if these atrocities did not occur.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book also fails to cover Islam's historic persecution of non-Muslim peoples during the ensuing 1,400 years --- including, but not limited to, Zoroastrians, Ba'hai, Hindus, Coptic Christians, Sudanese Christians and of course, Middle Eastern Jews. Nor does this book discuss what is likely the most chauvinistic city in the world-Mecca--which is closed all together to anyone but Muslims.<br /><br />The book's key advantage is its mercifully brief form. Otherwise, it is overly sugared pabulum.<br /><br />For brief lessons on faith, one is better off turning to the Internet, where a vast array of writings shows Islam in all its aspects. Some observers contend that Islam has been radicalized  by sects and leaders controlling more than 75% of the mosques in the western world, funded (like this book) by the Saudis--and Iran. For history, one might consider Bat Ye'or's understanding of Islamic political treatment of non-Muslims ([[ASIN:0838639437 Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide]], [[ASIN:0838636780 The Decline of Eastern Christianity Under Islam: From Jihad to Dhimmitude, Seventh-Twentieth Century]] and the [[ASIN:083864077X Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis]]).<br /><br />But give Karen Armstrong a pass.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

One hears their daily activities, the sale of pita, and various wares, as well as juke boxes and street sounds as the Mahala awakens.<br /><br />Mahala, for those unaware, is the village ghetto to which Rom people are generally confined, although the anthropologists who compiled this book do not seem to know that it is Arabic for ghetto, and the same word used in North Africa and other Middle Eastern Muslim nations to describe the Jewish and Christian ghettos in which those dhimmi groups are similarly confined. Dhimmis are the non-Muslim minorities in Muslim lands, and their treatment (and in Muslim nation remains) generally described and defined by the Islamic laws of jihad.<br /><br />Unlike most other recent books about the Rom, this one contains a massive amount of research on the lives and music of these people, as they live it; but what I like the most are the oral histories that provide readers with a real sense of the hardships suffered by the Rom in Greek Macedonia. While the book mentions the great and disastrous Turkish invasion of Greece in 1922, it does not note the great massacre of an estimated 150,000 Christian Greeks and Armenians in Smyrna on the Aegean coast that year. This  undoubtedly included some Rom, as the town was then (as now) central on the Turkish coast.<br /><br />But without knowing it, the authors have demonstrated some of the ill effects of Muslim rule, for they do discuss, via oral histories, the great liberation experienced by Greek Roma in 1924, when Turks were repatriated to Turkey and 1 million Greeks from Turkey to Greece. The latter may have lost some territory, but she gained liberation from Muslim oppression.<br /><br />As Greeks from Turkey poured into Greece, the town fathers in Jumaya, for example, and presumably everywhere else the Roma then lived in Greece, began to allow the Roma to go to school with Greeks. Beforehand, the Turks had imposed separation on non-Muslim peoples. But with Turks gone, Greeks exiled the old cast system too, thereby relinquishing the system that had helped imprison Greek Roma in lives without equal education. Now, suddenly, the Rom could attend the same school as everyone else.<br /><br />There are many wonderful features of this book, including the photographs and the music CD at its end. But make no mistake, the oral histories are the best feature, making this one of the best books on the Rom I have read to date.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

M. Elliot (d. 1853) and John Dowson (d. 1881), is a veritable treasure trove concerning the subjugation of the Indian subcontinent by Mohammedan forces beginning in the 8th century. The second volume, especially, covers the period through 1260, and finely details hostilities that wracked Hindu and Bhuddist India for 500 years.<br /><br />The works cited, all written by Indian historians themselves contemporary to the times reported, are rare glimpses into the brutal and oppressive nature of this conquest, which no one who troubles to read these works will ever again deny. As noted in an extract from Baihaki, one minister to the Raj told his Muslim ruler to \\"cut off my nose and lips and mutilate me...\\" and this was indeed done. In fact, it was not uncommon for non-Muslims to be enslaved, beheaded and or \\"deprived of the use of [their] feet and hands....\\"<br /><br />The reign of Mahmud, whose conquest of the Hind was noted in several works entitled Tarjuma-i Yamini by many authors, was marked by similar brutality. When Kusdar rebelled against Amir Subuktigin, in about 921 A.D., the latter \\"attacked the city of the ruler...and seized him suddenly, like as a sheep is seized, when its limbs are torn to be roasted and placed before a guest,\\" and peace was declared only after the ruler agreed to pay an onerous annual tax, known in Islam as the jizya. Afterwards, he made frequent \\"prosecution of holy wars\\" in the Hind, conquering forts, lofty hills and seizing their treasures, all of which Subuktigin stole from the \\"infidel\\" inhabitants.<br /><br />The ruler filled \\"cups to the brim with blood\\" before completing his exploits.<br /><br />Eight volumes like this will acquaint the reader of the true \\"tolerance\\" with which Islam laid waste the Indian subcontinent.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

In addition, the author weaves in her own travels through Ukraine and Poland, to the places that her father lived and traveled during the early war years. One learns in great detail, for example, about the British and allied betrayal of Czechoslovakia on the one hand, and of Poland, on the other.<br /><br />The historical facts are interesting and of great import even now, for their relevance to parallel, current-day situations in which the world community is all-too-willing to sacrifice third parties like Israel and the Southern Sudan on the alter of promises of peace (albeit false). Clearly, the world has learned little from history.<br /><br />But in the end, the author does not adequately explain her father's total silence about the war during her childhood. I kept expecting something of enormous import to happen in this book, and while it was interesting, and included a great deal of useful history, the end result was ultimately disappointing.<br /><br />The biggest fault herein is the structure: the author would have better-served her purpose by detailing the precarious situation of Poles at the book's outset, and re-emphasizing it throughout, rather than explaining the point only in hindsight at its end.

She introduced the tiny character named K'tonton in the September 1930 issue of Outlook magazine.<br /><br />The Adventures of K'tonton: The Little Jewish Tom Thumb was first published in 1935; it includes 16 stories and was reprinted at least 10 times. Each tale includes important Jewish ideas or traditions, and a dash of Jewish humor--and its own complex plot. A few tales from this volume--Ktonton's Sukkot Adventure and Ktonton's Yom Kippur Kitten--were reprinted later as individual books with new color illustrations.<br /><br />Isaac Samuel ben Baruch Reuben--whose first name meant laughter--was called K'tonton, which in case you wondered, is Hebrew for very very little. He was a late-born miracle for whom his mother had prayed so hard one Sukkot that she promised to love even a child \\"no bigger than a thumb.\\" Sure enough, before a year had passed, she gave birth to a son. And sure enough, he was no bigger than her thumb. She blanketed him in the flax she had used to wrap an etrog--the Israeli citrus fruit used to celebrate Sukkot--and cradled him in a hand-carved etrog box.<br /><br />It was also on the harvest festival of Sukkot that K'tonton made his first trip to the synagogue. As his father put his etrog carefully into its box to take to shul, K'tonton eagerly asked to join him. \\"Next year,\\" answered his father, \\"when you're a little bigger.\\" Like all over-eager boys, K'tonton did something he shouldn't, and climbed inside the etrog box to hide.<br /><br />Once in shul, he couldn't see, so he climbed onto the lulav--the palm branch that is pointed east, west, south and north, to the heavens and to earth as part of the celebration. As K'tonton's father rose with the congregation to chant Hodu l'Adonai ki tov--Praise the Lord for God is good--there was K'tonton singing from atop the lulav, in a high treble that rose above all the other voices.<br /><br />I can't tell all the myriad details, but here's a taste of K'tonton's adventures: He planned a palace for the Sabbath Queen, saved the birds on Shabbat Shirah, planted trees in Israel and sent them a Shanah Tovah (a Happy New Year). In one hilarious tale, a spinning Chanukah dreidel carried K'tonton off the table, down the stairs, out the door, into the street and into a gutter, where he found a small bit of Chanukah money known in Yiddish as gelt.<br /><br />K'tonton also turned up in a Purim cookie, a Hamentash, covered with poppy seeds. On the day before Passover, he helped (with a mouse) find and discard the last crumbs in the house to help celebrate the redemption of the Hebrew slaves. He had a picnic on Lag Ba'Omer, rode an arrow and a bird. The book also features stories for Shevuot, Rosh Hashonah, Yom Kippur (when K'tonton tried to feed a hungry cat), Shemini Atzeret, Simchat Torah and a finale for Sukkot.<br /><br />Each one of these 16 special stories of a tiny boy will light children's eyes.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Furthermore, he observes that popular religion admits error but denies guilt.<br /><br />Yet according to Littell, a Christian theologian of towering virtue, \\"the crucifixion of the Jews is an unavoidable reality,\\"  for churches exemplifying a shameless fact. This reminds one of Littell's eloquent call, in Simon Wiesenthal's Sunflower, for increased awareness of the earnest nature of the \\"choice between good and evil, between innocence and guilt.\\"<br /><br />Israel's very existence, he writes, disproves the replacement theology that would have the Jewish people withering away. The state's strength refutes that idea that Israel and or the Jewish people will eventually be assimilated or annihilated, as well as a \\"traditional Christian myth about their end in the historic process.\\" For this reason, Littell argues that Israel creates a crisis in much of contemporary Christian theology.<br /><br />To his great credit, Littell recognizes that it is not only the Christian peoples of the world that cannot define themselves without reference to the Jewish people. The same situation presides for Muslims, whose definition of themselves also stems from Judaism.<br /><br />Meanwhile, although the Jewish people define themselves in reference to gentiles, it defines neither Christians nor Muslims nor any other non-Jews, but calls them all gentiles and asks only that they abide by Noachite laws--in other words, follow seven of the 10 commandments; all who do so, Judaism considers righteous.<br /><br />Moreover, the Jewish people need neither Christians nor Muslims to define themselves, which Littell believes perhaps to account for much of the hatred Jewish people have faced over the centuries and today.<br /><br />Littell recounts quite thoughtfully the history of church anti-Semitism, putting all of this detail into the context of its relevance today. There is a struggle with the past in all churches, he writes, a trial which remains as yet unresolved.<br /><br />During the Holocaust, he observes, Jewish people died en masse because other peoples and nations did not recognize their people- and nationhood. \\"Christians, with the exception of a minority of martyrs and confessors, betrayed the life unto which they were called.\\"<br /><br />But Israel, after all, was and remains the thing that places Christianity into crisis, although Littell admits that Islam's crisis is far deeper than that of Christendom, the Islamic spiritual and intellectual unity remains that of an \\"unscientific religious culture,\\" which hasn't yet \\"entered the period of voluntary adherence, pluralism, skeptical study.\\" Littell places the monastic mindset of Islam today on the same plane as the Christian culture of the 13th century.<br /><br />This hardly relieves Christianity of its grave responsibilities, however. According to Littell, the post-Christian eras of Marxism, secular humanism, postivism, and various forms of fascism must be added to the crisis in values plaguing the west. The assured oral tradition of earlier eras has eroded seriously, he writes, far mores than in the Muslim states, which boast \\"hafiz,\\" or living libraries, people who have committed many books in the Islamic tradition to memory.<br /><br />During the Yom Kippur War, Littell recalls the anti-Semitic press pundits whose grossly anti-Jewish ideology boiled to the surface in vulgar BBC, newspaper and even parliamentary oratories and essays. \\"This was obviously not the same Britain that had stood courageously alone against the Nazis or even the one that under Anthony Eden's leadership had checked Nasser's illegal military operations in the Suez, Sharm-el-Sheik and the Sinai in May 1967.<br /><br />In France, \\"even handedness\\"in 1973 allowed for the training of Arab fighters, a surge in Gaulist right-wing anti-Semitism, and arms shipments to Saudi Arabia and Libya.<br /><br />In Germany, the nation that in 1952 had admirably embarked upon a rapprochement with Israel, now capitulated to the Arab League. These Christian nations, once Christendom's heartland, \\"acted in a crucial moment without regard to religious or ethical considerations.\\"<br /><br />As for free churches such as the Quakers, Landrom Bolling's \\"Search for Peace in the Middle East\\" and other similarly titled editions were blind to the ethics, sensitivity, courage and confrontation of injustice for which Quakers were traditionally famous, much less to the facts of the regional history. Most important, these reports all ignored the 1 million Jewish refugees forced from their homes and businesses with nothing by the 22 Arab Muslim nations.<br /><br />The left wing of the churches, Littell observes, has so often tended to focus on the reformation that it has completely ignored the model set by the Jewish people, forgetting that the new covenant of Christ was laid on the foundation of service to God set by the Jewish people.

The book contains many photographs which belie the insistence of Arab nations that Palestinians were peaceful and driven from their land. Photographs of the Arab revolt in 1936 show quite the opposite.<br /><br />Jewish farmers were unarmed and isolated, and remained unprotected by British troops then occupying the land, ostensibly with the authority of the League of Nations and for the construction of a Jewish Homeland, but in fact, to the detriment of the Jewish people.<br /><br />Attacks came quickly and for the most part at night, when hundreds of Jews were slaughtered in their beds. Torture and rape were commonplace, as was sheer butchery of Jews by Arabs.<br /><br />Beginning in chapter 2, Katz focuses on the War of Independence, in which Israel barely won its survival, and some 481,000 Arabs fled the land of Israel for what they mistakenly believed would be a short sojourn while Arab nations destroyed the nascent Jewish state.<br /><br />The fedayeen came to be known in English as the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, but in Arabic as Harakat al-Tahrir al-Watani al-Filastini, better known as Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement--though I remain dubious of the terminology for such a group.<br /><br />Founded in the 1950s by Arafat and Khalil Wazir, Fatah launched its first terrorist raid on January 1, 1965; terrorists laid a faulty bomb aimed at cutting off Israel's water supply, but failure did not deter them.<br /><br />After the Six Day War in 1967, Fatah took up terror in earnest to keep pace with rival terror groups such as the PLFP founded by George Habash, a prominent Christian who nevertheless promoted Islamic jihad ideology. Similarly, Abu Iyad's Black September group massacred 11 Israeli athletes in Munich in September 1972. In 1973, Black September, on orders from Arafat himself, executed two American diplomats in Khartoum, Sudan.<br /><br />Katz covers such terrorist figures as Abu Abbas, who commanded the PLFP members that seized the Achille Lauro while it cruised the Mediterranean, shot Leon Klinghoffer, 69, point blank, and threw the body of the wheelchair-bound Jewish New Yorker into the sea; he had been traveling with his wife to celebrate a milestone wedding anniversary.<br /><br />Also discussed is Fathi Shaqaqi, who founded Palestinian Islamic Jihad in about 1979, helped plan the 1981 assassination of Anwar Sadat, was one of several inventors and promoters of the suicide bomb--and was assassinated on October 26, 1995 in Malta. He was succeeded by Ramadan Abdullah Shallah, who with Fathi's brother Khalil Shaqaqi served as an executive of Sami Al-Arian's World and Islam Studeies Enterprise in Tampa, Florida, according to Steve Emerson's Jihad in America (p. 112).<br /><br />While Katz hits the nail on the head concerning all terrorist groups, he again misses the mark on points of ancient and medieval history, however. He accepts without question a false claim that Palestinians descend from Philistines; in fact,  the Philistines were utterly vanquished and disappeared. Moreover, Arab family names in Israel (at least, of the majority) tell of their origins in the Mughrab, Egypt, Sudan, Arabia, Yemen and Iraq--not in Israel, ancient or modern.<br /><br />Moreover, Katz once again glosses over the bloody beginnings of the Islamic faith, and accepts without question the strictly modern claim that Mohammed slept in Jerusalem. In fact, Mohammed never visited the holy Jewish city, where mosques did not \\"spring up,\\" but were built on vanquished Jewish holy sites and the ruins of churches.<br /><br />In short, read Katz to learn about terror, not for his take on ancient or medieval history.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Gone from the headlines (fortunately) are Germany's Red Army Faction and Baader Meinhof gang, as well as the Japanese Red Army.<br /><br />But all three groups were tied to major terror attacks and murders in the 1970s--as Katz explains. And what makes these 72 pages filling six chapters especially interesting are the highlighted factors that bound such groups to an international terrorist coalition--the Cold War, Communism--and the Middle East.<br /><br />How many kids (or adults for that matter) realize that the RAF \\"studied\\" with Palestinian terrorists who hoped to drive Israel from the Middle East, in terror camps in south Lebanon, or helped them purchase arms and ammo on the world's black markets?<br /><br />It made a sort of deadly sense, for whereas Arabs might raise Israeli suspicions when crossing into Israel territory from Lebanon, \\"a white European would not\\" (p. 13). Alas, the same thinking seems to function today for such \\"peace activists\\" as the International Solidarity Movement, whose workers in reality train in terror techniques and subterfuge, according to FrontPageMagazine and reporter Lee Kaplan.<br /><br />Similarly, Katz exposes the ties of Greek \\"revolutionaries\\" in the group called 17 November that sprang from the Italian and British withdrawals from Greece in the aftermath of World War II. Herein lies my greatest criticism.<br /><br />The 17 November group assassinated U.S. and Greek officials in 1975, and during the 1990 and 1991 Persian Gulf War attacked U.S. targets with greater intensity. This was terrorism of the worst sort, for which there is no excuse.<br /><br />Nevertheless, given 17 November's terror against Turkey, Katz should have mentioned the context of Greek resistance against 14 centuries of jihad, including the Greek civil war.<br /><br />Finally, how many realize that the JRA trained with the PLFP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine) alongside Kurds, South Africans, Irish and German terrorists in the mountains near Sidon? How many remember the May 30, 1972 attack in Lod Israel, when three Japanese travelers from Rome blew 26 (mostly) Puerto Rican Christian pilgrims off the planet and left 52 others crippled for life?<br /><br />The best thing about this book is its clear demarcation of lines that respect no race, and no religion, and whose victims can be anyone, anywhere.

(Not to mention its low price.)<br /><br />Alas, David Toback (or rather, his grand-daughter, who adapted the book from his 1888 and 1889 journals) only once mentioned the Caucasus Muslim communities, despite travels over several years of extreme duress. This consequence stemmed from his apparent  lack of contact with Muslims, however, undoubtedly not from their respect for dhimmis around them.<br /><br />In any case, Toback's saga has much to hold the reader's interest in its own right, and I was delighted with the book, which I tore through in one marathon four-hour sitting last summer. Toback relates, after all, the extreme poverty of the Jewish communities during those times, their pious, even righteous religious orthodoxy, and the afflictions imposed upon them by hateful tsarist troops, peasants and lawmakers, who deprived Jews of lives, liberty and property at their routine whim.<br /><br />Certainly in current times, one cannot say that Jews anywhere in the world live wholly without fear and some concern about the future, as anti-Antisemitism has made a frightening and extraordinary comeback only 60 years after the liberation of Auschwitz and 50 years after 1 million Jews were driven with nothing but the clothes on their backs from their homes and businesses within the Arab Muslim world.<br /><br />Despite the recent turn of events, however, this book provides a very real reminder that things can always be worse. Indeed for David Toback, they almost always did get worse, until he finally convinced his wife to flee to the US., a feat which took several years to accomplish.<br /><br />In truth, there is not so much difference between the attacks, firebombings, murders and forced evacuations suffered by Toback's people and family and the situation of Jewish people today in Israel and France and in Moscow and the Caucasus, where Muslim fundamentalists think nothing of blowing up pizza parlors, buses, theaters and schools.<br /><br />A question this book raised for me is why North American Jews remain so complacent.

Alas, Griffin's romanticization of the Murid wars which consumed the better part of 50 years, from the 1820s through the 1860s, leaves a great deal to be desired, mostly because Griffin did absolutely no work to place these wars into the historical context of the global Islamic jihad, which began with Mohammed's reign of terror in the Jewish and other non-Muslim communities of seventh century Arabia, and continued throughout Islamic history, wherever non-Muslim communities abutted Islamic ones.<br /><br />Griffin describes, for example, the particularly horrific capture of some princely wives and children from an idyllic estate in the southern Caucasus and their entrapment for many months with the wives of the leading jihadi of the era, including at least one Armenian woman, herself a victim of the historical Islamic tradition of entrapment and enslavement of non-Muslim women and children forced to submit to Islamic life and law.<br /><br />To Griffin, however, this episode, along with every other bloody exploit of the Islamic warriors was somehow justifiable, despite the fact that the so called victims began the wars when Islamic chieftains and their brigands encroached upon Russian communities along their borders to rape, pillage, thieve and otherwise harass their neighbors on the northern frontier.<br /><br />Griffin sets these wars into a text that spans his journey of several months through the region in the 1990s, before the Russian counter-terror operations in Grozny again reached a crescendo late in the decade. It is passingly interesting to learn of the various drunkards with whom he traversed the region, but wholly unimportant except as a window onto a way of life that continues in the tradition of Islamic jihad.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Griffin draws upon the equally false and romanticized musings of Leo Tolstoy, whose last novel eulogized a central figure in the Murid wars, Haji Murid, who despite his Islamisist attitudes and barbarities, occasionally demonstrated kindness, as when he won back Tolstoy's ruinous gambling losses and returned the promissory notes to the famed novelist the next morning.<br /><br />Certainly there have been many ugly eras in Russian history, but it is historical outrage to suggest that 19th century Russian treatment of Muslims (after all, resulting from ceaseless Muslim assaults on Russian communities near the Caucasus) in any way justified Muslim slaughters of Russians during those horrible decades.<br /><br />Worse, the account ignores massive historical evidence of 1,400 years of Islamic human rights abuses (of which the Murid wars were just a tiny microcosm). Griffin presents 19th century terrorists as somehow heroic and awesome, a pattern repeated in modern reporting on the continuing jihad.<br /><br />I am sorry, but I miss the romance in stealing other people's women and children, murdering the stragglers, tying naked nursemaids to trees and reigning death on legions of entrapped Russian soldiers whose sole purpose was in the first place to protect Russian communities from Islamic terror.<br /><br />Now, history repeats.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

This one is refreshingly frank, up to a point.<br />Katz opens with a frank four-page section outlining the associations, terminology and major figures backing Islamic terror, or to be blunt, the Islamic war against infidels. The brief introduction follows, with the unflinching fact that such people are bent upon destroying all non-Muslims, as well as western civilization as a whole.<br />Here, kids will find an honest assessment of 20th and early 21st century Islamic terrorists, including data on some of the worst offenders, including Hasan al-Banna, founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, which spawned Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hamas, and various other organized Islamic murder groups.<br />The book deals with core Islamic terror leaders worldwide, not the Middle East alone.<br />The 72-page text is accompanied by an excellent glossary, several maps, a three-page timeline starting with the founding of Islam by Mohammed in 610, and a bibliography and recommended reading on various Internet sites. It's a shame that Robert Spencer's JihadWatch isn't among them.<br />Katz' five chapters for the most part cover 20th century jihad, beginning with \\"The Fire is Kindled: Egypt's Jihad warriors;\\" Egypt being the birth-ground of both al-Banna and Sayed Qutb. This chapter also covers Hamas, and the assassination of Egypt's Anwar el-Sadat by al-Gamal al-Islamiya in the 1970s.<br />Kids also read about terrorists in Lebanon, where Hezbollah finds backing from Syria and Iran's radical mullahs. In chapter three, they learn about Algeria, where Islamic fascists agitated first against French colonial rule in the 1950s and finally against their own people, murdering some 250,000 Algerians in recent decades.<br />The fourth chapter covers Al Qaeda's founding by Arab Palestinian Yusuf Azzam, its international network and funding, and many of the other key figures surrounding Osama bin Laden, and now targeted by the U.S. war on terror.<br />The Epilogue is a brief accounting of how far the western nations must still travel in order to defeat Islamic terrorism, followed by the above mentioned suggestions for further library and online reading.<br />But in his first chapter, Katz mistakenly casts Islam's earlier eras as more benevolent, even golden. Actually, Islamic history is filled with bloody jihad, beginning with Mohammed's slaughter of Arabia's Jews in Yathrib (later, Medina) and Khaybar. The \\"lucky\\" Jewish farmers in Fadak and Wadi'l-Qura, on Palestine's border, were merely enslaved or suffered extortionate taxes. Similarly, Jewish people in Eilat, Maqna and Adhruh had to \\"accept Islam, or pay the tax, and obey God and His Messenger and the messengers of His Messenger...,\\" to guarantee their security \\"on land and on sea.\\" Failure ensured Mohammed's promise to \\"fight you and take you as captives and slay the elderly,\\" threats that were as common in Islamic history as now.

Alas, it proves every bit as heart-rending as I'd expected. Dr. Hancock has written an important and necessary account of the largely untold story of oppression against the Romani people, which deserves much wider distribution.<br /><br />The book touches on the genocide committed against the Rom in the Holocaust, when an estimated 500,000 Romani people were murdered.<br /><br />But my chief interest concerned the derivation of the Rom arrival as slaves in Europe. I had known for many years that the Rom originated in India, had been enslaved for 500 years in Europe and were emancipated only in the first half of the 19th century. But what was the genesis of this massive oppression, first documented in Moldavia in 1333 under Rudolph IV and Stephan Dusan, and relieved only following the 1826 Russian invasion of Moldavia and Wallachia? This was a mystery prior readings did not address.<br /><br />In truth, the source of Rom enslavement was not so hard to determine. Therefore it seems surprising that, as best I can tell, only the late K.S. Lal ever examined or even touched on the obvious source of the Roma presence in Europe: the Islamic jihad conquests that swept all the way to India beginning in the 8th century. But indeed, as Lal notes in [[ASIN:8185689032 Legacy of Muslim Rule in India]] (pp. 112-113), it was the invaders' practice during their 500 year reign of devastation to \\"capture defenseless [Hindu] people and make them slaves for service and sale.\\"<br /><br />Thus with the arrival of Mahmud of Ghazni these hapless souls were sold as slaves to Transoxnia and the Arab empire and transported to Iran, Armenia, Turkey, Hungary, Italy, Spain and Britain and even to the Americas. As Hancock further highlights in this superb study, the first documented mention of Rom slaves in Europe roughly paralleled the dates of the Islamic assaults on Europe, which carried with them the devastation, slaughter and institutional discrimination established against non-Muslims earlier in all other parts of the Islamic empire.<br /><br />The Balkan economy flourished during the Middle Ages, Hancock observes, as Muslims conquered territory after territory, subjugated people after people and cut off European access to the East. As Muslim Tatar and Seljuk armies swept west through the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire, the Balkans offered an alternative route to the Holy Land. Hungary and Wallachia also profited by military traffic during the 200-year Crusader retaliations that followed 500 years of Islamic jihad wars on Christendom.<br /><br />Hancock postulates that Islamic assaults on Europe carried both refugees from Muslim conquests of India and Eurasia, warriors retreating from jihadi advance--and finally slaves impressed into the service of Muslim invaders. The Domba Romani people express various linguistic attributes of the Sudra caste, suggesting that they included both infidels enslaved after primary Muslim massacres in India, and Rajasthani-speaking Rajput cavalry who in the 10th century moved west into Iran and fled further and further to escape the advancing Islamic encroachment into Armenia.<br /><br />The 19th century Dutch historian De Goeje, Hancock reports, suggested that the European Rom descended from 27,000 Zott captured in 855 and forcibly transported to Syria. But the Indic Jakati language is fairly remote from Romani. Hancock prefers the thesis of Soulis--namely that the Romani appeared in Byzantine lands following \\"the Seljuk raids in Armenia where the Gypsies...had stayed for a long time, as the great number of Armenian loan-words in their vocabulary testifies.\\"<br /><br />This seems most likely, he adds, since the late 11th century jihad caused mass migration of Armenians too, into what became Little Armenia in Sicilia. The westward flow of refugees was almost certainly one cause of Romani migration, along with the Islamic assault on Anatolia.<br /><br />As noted above, Hancock's thesis makes tremendous sense when matched with the conclusions of the late Hindu scholar of Islam, K.S. Lal. While some Rom people may have fled the Islamic conquest and massacres in India in the 8th and 9th centuries, a far greater number were undoubtedly transported by Muslims as slaves, since enslavement in India was massive.<br /><br />For the Romani people, the result of all these Islamic wars was double irony and oppression. As Hancock observes, Christians in the Byzantine Empire regarded them as Muslims. Muslims in the East and later Europe regarded them as Christians.<br /><br />While Christians indisputably oppressed the Rom, however, Hancock describes laws that governed their treatment and status as slaves--which decidedly resemble laws of Islamic Sharia. For example, Romani slaves were debased creatures, just as dhimmis in Islamic lands obtained no rights whatever so as to feel themselves debased and beneath their Muslim rulers. Similarly, as in the Sharia, owners of Rom slaves had no legal right to murder them, yet commonly did so all the same, and no master was ever prosecuted for such a crime. The women were just as often violated as concubines.<br /><br />This book provides a remarkable window onto the genesis of 500 years of Rom enslavement, and the oppression that consequently to this day follows these impoverished, abused and unfairly stereotyped and maligned people.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Chapters alternate between 1854 and the 1840s, when Burns spent his boyhood and youth as the slave of Virginia plantation-owner Charles Suttle. In 35 children's books, the late Virginia Hamilton (1936-2002) frequently focused on themes of slavery and inequality.<br /><br />No dry or fictional account, this riveting read-aloud elucidates 19th century heroism culminating in a dramatic denouement before Burns' untimely death at 28 in Canada on July 27, 1862. The epilogue covers repercussions to Boston abolitionists and others who helped him.<br /><br />The book initiates fine in-class discussions of current-day slavery and abolitionists at Christian Solidarity International, iAbolish (the American anti-Slavery Group) and other groups who seek to end the practice, forever.<br /><br />The story opens with Burns' Boston abduction. His flashbacks transport readers to his early years in Virginia; these crescendo in his flight from slavery and trial. Hamilton sets historical figures in context and invigorates their fiery sermons, posters and political gatherings with life. She fleshes out the details of Burns' life, from his point of view. He experiences hardships but dares to hope. His story includes suspense and drama that gets children's attention.<br /><br />Burns suffered horribly. For example, he was once confined for four months to a slave jail in North Carolina, his arms and legs always shackled. In solitary confinement with inadequate hygiene and food, he became seriously ill. Still, Anthony Burns went on to achieve great things.<br /><br />The book infuses children with the indignation of the abolitionists here portrayed. They were determined to defeat barbarism on American soil. Pastors and politicians, freed men and attorneys, and even some southerners, willingly defied federal laws to advance humanitarian ends, which the U.S. achieved within a decade of these events.<br /><br />Kids see here a predominantly Judeo-Christian society, willing to accept responsibility for wrongs, amend them and repair to honest labor and nation building. The U.S. freed its slaves 150 years ago, at enormous but willing sacrifice--a gruesome war that took 600,000 lives. By contrast, radical Muslim Sudan today claims it neither condones nor practices slavery, yet indentures some 100,000 black southern Sudanese Christians, according to the New York Times, and systematically murders 1,000 blacks weekly in a genocide that has thus far felled more than 2 million non-Muslim and other blacks. Sudan, with only Islamic human rights, mandates institutional enslavement and discrimination against all non-Muslims.<br /><br />Hamilton's saga is a fabulous teaching tool. Indeed, she was named Virginia to remind her of her family's roots--and the imperative to use her liberty well. Burns was a hero in every sense of the word, as were those compassionately determined to eliminate slavery in the U.S. This book provides great history. Good teachers will also use it to encourage new abolitionists, until slavers and slavery are utterly defeated, everywhere.<br /><br />--Alyssa A. Lappenhin a decade of these events.

Following his introduction, 14 independent essays divide into two sections, the first on supposed progressives within contemporary Islam. None is as moderate as one might hope.<br /><br />The opening essay by Khaled Abou El Fadl remarks that excising Islam's &#34;ugliness&#34; ignores the &#34;beautiful in the vast and rich [Islamic] tradition&#34; (p. 62). This I cannot judge. He then focuses on placing &#34;the primary responsibility for the vast majority of extreme acts of ugliness that are witnessed today in the Islamic world&#34; (p. 43), which he identifies as a supremacist and puritanical orientation. This seems correct and true, so far as it goes.<br /><br />Alas, El Fadl discredits his analysis by restricting his discussion to limited historical periods and blaming the &#34;ugliness&#34; entirely upon the Salafi'i and Wahhabi groups, whose theology he labels &#34;Salafabism.&#34; To the untutored, this may sound reform-minded. Unfortunately, neither El Fadl's coined term, nor factors he claims to isolate, reflect the depth or breadth of the &#34;problem&#34; scholars commonly associate with Islam. A more truthful analysis might admit that a supremacist and puritanical streak pervades much of Islam's 1,400-year history, and certainly all schools of Islamic law, and propose some means of amendment.<br /><br />In Pakistan, for example, both civil and religious judges impose Islamic law (Shari'a, the only kind of justice available), and generally prohibit non-Muslims from testifying against Muslims. In certain cases, the law itself prohibits non-Muslim testimony. Such thinking is traditional to &#34;tolerant&#34; prescriptions outlined by the medieval Islamic jurist Al-Mawardi (d. 1058) in The Laws of Islamic Governance, which remains a standard of Islamic law today, even among some moderate Muslim thinkers. Perhaps El Fadl would not admit this Shafi'i jurist to his definition of &#34;moderate.&#34;<br /><br />Even disqualifying Shafi'i laws completely, however, would leave El Fadl to contend with the Maliki, Hanbali and Hanafi schools of Islamic jurisprudence, which he does not do either. All require Muslims to engage in jihad war to subjugate non-Muslim peoples. For example, Maliki jurist Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani (d. 996) argues, &#34;Jihad is a precept of Divine institution.&#34; Sure, he excuses certain Malikis and proscribes wars before Muslims invite their enemies &#34;to embrace the religion of Allah except where the enemy attacks first.&#34; But al-Qayrawani requires formal discrimination against infidels. &#34;They have the alternative of either converting to Islam or paying the poll tax (jizya), short of which war will be declared against them.&#34;<br /><br />The Hanafi Hidayah (cited in Hughes' 19th century Dictionary of Islam, pp. 244-248), also demands jihad by divine ordinance: &#34;War is permanently established until the day of judgment,&#34; necessitating bloody discrimination against non-Muslims. Hanafis recognize war as &#34;murderous and destructive&#34; by nature, enjoined only for &#34;advancing the true faith or repelling evil.&#34; But it is only the impossibility of outfitting all Muslim warriors at once that lets &#34;any single tribe or party of Muslims,&#34; by engaging in jihad war, render &#34;the obligation ...no longer binding upon the rest.&#34; Wahhabis for their part favor Hanbali jurist Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328). Even a brief review of Islamic law concerning non-Muslims, then, exposes the disingenuously superficial nature of El Fadl's discussion of Islamic &#34;ugliness.&#34;<br /><br />This is worrisome, considering his approval of a U.S. foundation's school curriculum that, in one exercise, asks students to advocate for institution of a blasphemy amendment in the U.S. constitution.<br /><br />Farid Esack's essay on 9/11 likewise misses the mark. He tries and fails to define and distinguish progressive and liberal Islam from one another. He offers the perfunctory condemnation of the September 11 attacks and criticism of fundamentalism. But strangely, Esack next criticizes acceptance of peace and the status quo. This sounds very like traditional jihad ideology, which is neither liberal nor progressive, however he may define them. A true progressive should rather generate constructive proposals by which Islamic legal foundations could be amended, within accepted Islamic norms, among other things so as to accept non-Muslims as equals. Unfortunately, Esack falls into a blame game, and by refusing to accept any Islamic responsibility whatever again appears decidedly illiberal and unprogressive.<br /><br />Then there is Safi's assignment of two thirds of this book (its introduction and chapters 1 through 10) to students in his Islam and Modernity course at Colgate (syllabus online). As we see, Safi's book is not progressive, but quite traditional. The course evidently isn't progressive either, for it requires that students write three pages on 24 serious thinkers, scholars and political commentators whom Safi describes as &#34;Islamophobes, or folks whose political views and/or scholarship shape how Islam is presented today.&#34; As author Robert Spencer suggests online, it's unclear why a progressive professor would think labeling a group of people conducive to intelligent debate.<br /><br />But most startling is the suggestion that students scrutinize two men born as Muslims, and a convert known widely to praise Islamic tolerance and democratic traditions, excepting only Wahhabi brand extremism. For anyone familiar with Islam, this appears to be a search for apostasy, a crime for which the Sharia demands death.<br /><br />It is up to Muslims to determine how they might best reform their faith. But so far as any &#34;ugliness&#34; affects ex- or non-Muslims, the rest of us should certainly not accept a &#34;progressive&#34; label for views that appear decidedly reactionary.

Certainly, there is a lot of good information about which corporations are funding art, where they fund it, and how. If you want to know which corporations fund art, how much they fund, where they do so, this is the book for you. The book contains lots of specifics, tables, statistics, examples of exhibits and color plates of many individual art works.<br /><br />The problem is that the book assumes that corporate and other private funding of art is a new phenomenon, and assumes this is by definition a bad thing. But is it? Considered in the context of the history of Western art, and even, one might add, arts in Asia and in various empires of eras gone by, wealthy benefactors have been a mainstay of the literary and fine arts, to speak somewhat hyperbolically, almost from the moment arts were invented.<br /><br />Shakespeare was privately funded. So was Rembrandt. So were the Dutch masters. So was Michelangelo. So were most other Renaissance artists, in fact. Remember the Medicis? To pretend, therefore, that &#34;neo-conservatives&#34; are a sudden, new and unwelcome scourge of the art market is ridiculous, and taken entirely out of the context of art history.<br /><br />Naturally, there have also always been conflicts of interest. Someone who funds something will want to have some control, after all. That is human nature. But like the conflicts this book points out, the arts of bygone eras also reflect such conflicts, and we nevertheless think them masterful.<br /><br />By their very nature, the royalty, peers, merchants --- and all other wealthy benefactors of literary and fine arts through the ages --- were conservatives, too. The arts, come what may, have always survived, as they will no doubt continue to do in the future. To do that, they need benefactors. And in all ages, the arts have turned to those with the most money, for support. Such are the facts of life.<br /><br />--Alyssa A. Lappen	2004-02-28

Only three maps concern periods before the twentieth century. The third shows the Turkish conquerors' vilayet re-districting of the Holy Land in 1888, plus areas of Arab-Jewish conflict during the last three decades of Ottoman rule.<br /><br />The book's fourth map clearly outlines the areas excluded in 1915 from the independence promised by the British to the Arabs, and requested by Hussein of Mecca for Arab cantons. Neither side mentioned southern Palestine, the Mutasarriflik of Jerusalem or the Jewish people--at all.<br /><br />Further maps also evidence the eagerness of Arab property owners to sell waste land to Jewish settlers at very high prices, for very large tracts were made available.<br /><br />Still others show the locations of Arab attacks on Jewish communities beginning in 1882. Through 1914, bands of Arabs assaulted at least 10 Jewish settlements between Jaffa and Jerusalem and in the Jezreel Valley.<br /><br />From 1920 on, the maps show progressively more attacks, in which Arab assailants destroyed the new landowners' forests, wheat fields, orange groves and cattle, burned and stoned their shops and factories--and murdered unarmed Jews.<br /><br />A March 1920 attack by a large number of Halsa Arabs on the Jews in Tel Hai killed six; an April 1920 attack on B'nai Yehuda killed one. In May 1921, Arab riots prompted Britain, the League of Nations' trustee of all Middle Eastern Mandates, to end Jewish immigration and \\"close settlement of the land\\" throughout Transjordan, both of which the League had sought, with Arab approval, only a few years earlier. Only these attacks, and the Arab 1929 riots that killed 20 Jewish children and elders in Safed, 7 in Hacarmel, 6 in Motza, 1 in Hulda, 6 in Tel Aviv, 2 in Beer Toviya--and 59 in Hebron-- persuaded previously passive Jewish farmers to take up arms, thereby defying British prohibitions against Jewish self-defense.<br /><br />The fact is, Arab riots occurred well in advance of Israel's creation. They took scores of Jewish civilian lives. And then (in 1921)--as now--the only Arabs killed by Jews were killed in counter-attacks that followed the initial Arab assaults.<br /><br />All this shows clearly on the maps readers reach page 14.<br /><br />From here, the pictorials exhibit the precise dimensions of the 1936 Arab riots, with one page devoted to each of four months. The casualties to Jewish life and property were massive and nationwide. More riots in 1937 and 1938 followed.<br /><br />Most enlightening of all, however, are those maps detailing the various partition plans over the years. The first of these, which the Jewish people accepted, and the Arabs rejected, was the 1937 Peel Commission proposal. The Peel Commission envisioned a tiny Jewish State, an L-shaped affair perhaps 6 or 8 miles-wide along the Mediterranean coast, from south of Rehovot to a few miles north of Acre with a northern corridor no more than 30 miles deep running from the coast, and inland on a border south of Afula to Beit Shean. Even this, the Jewish people accepted, and Arabs rejected.<br /><br />But the Peel proposal was most remarkable for something else it inherently acknowledged: Jerusalem was not a \\"traditionally Arab city,\\" as modern-day news repeatedly misinforms us. Its population--which was centered in the Old City--was predominantly Jewish. Christians and Muslims were minorities.<br /><br />Thus the Peel Commission assigned Jerusalem, Bethlehem and a roughly oval-shaped area surrounding them, to an international trust to be managed by Britain for the League of Nations.<br /><br />When that plan foundered on the Arab refusals, two subsequent 1938 partition plans proposed assigning even larger areas to the international trust. The more significant of the pair was the British Woodhead plan, as it was none too sympathetic to Zioninsts.Nevertheless, Woodhead expanded the international area encompassing Jerusalem and Bethlehem to include \\"traditionally Arab Ramallah\\" as well.<br /><br />It is a lot more difficult after consulting this book, to lay blame for the Arab Israeli conflict solely on Israel's doorstep. The pictures tell the story. While the Camp David II final settlement offered in 2000 and 2001 is not shown, the book does contain maps of the \\"peace enclaves\\" as the future Palestinian Authority areas were then called. Moreover the later proposals almost seem unnecessary, given the illustrations of intense anti-Jewish attacks that began even before Israel was a state.<br /><br />In short, Israel could and would have been much smaller than it is today if only Arabs had in 1937 accepted any Jewish state. They didn't, although none of the current issues even existed in 1937. But then, they had begun attacking Jewish farmers decades before Israel had any borders at all.

That brilliant 1990s staging, easily one of the 20th century's most remarkable, taught perhaps tens of thousands something about this otherwise obscure artist and author, whose life the Nazis prematurely snuffed out.<br /><br />Schulz' 1934 novel included several of his masterful drawings and etchings, some of which also appear in other books. He painted in words and pictures.<br /><br />One vision of meals at his family's home obviously influenced McBurney's script, which includes a wonderful scene at a Schulz dinner featuring the family's many colorful relations and friends. The play reflects Schulz' surreal brilliance, through amazing antics--chairs hanging from a wall, tablecloths floating in air and an uncle walking on the ceiling.<br /><br />The play opens with a remarkable scene: The disconnected hands and feet of many Holocaust victims wave helplessly through a trap door while Schulz feeds books into a pot-bellied stove, downstage right. This evokes the era's wholesale terror, its destruction of untold millions of Jewish civilians--and its fierce war on ideas. Indeed, during the Nazi occupation of Poland, Schulz was forced to sort and burn those titles they had banned.<br /><br />Schulz was born on July 12, 1892, the third and youngest child of a Polish merchant in Drohobycz, where he lived a life tragically abbreviated by the Holocaust. He reflected this town (and his close connections to family) in all his written and artistic works. When the Soviets occupied eastern Poland (and Drohobycz) in 1939, Schulz avoided the deportation suffered by hundreds of thousands of other Jewish Poles, although the USSR prohibited him from working.<br /><br />But Polish Jews experienced far worse hardships with the June 1941 Nazi occupation of eastern Poland. Schulz was then enslaved for a year by Felix Landau, the infamous Viennese Nazi and Jew murderer. He survived on one daily bowl of soup and slice of bread.<br /><br />Gestapo officer Karl Guenther shot Schulz in the head on Black Thursday, Nov. 19, 1942. A devoted friend buried him at night in a Jewish cemetery, which has since disappeared, along with Schulz' grave.<br /><br />Most of his artistic and written work also disappeared into the Holocaust's maw.<br /><br />But thanks to McBurney's extraordinary play, part of Schulz' incalculable brilliance was vividly revived.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Only three maps concern periods before the twentieth century. The third shows the Turkish conquerors' vilayet re-districting of the Holy Land in 1888, plus areas of Arab-Jewish conflict during the last three decades of Ottoman rule.<br />The book's fourth map clearly outlines the areas excluded in 1915 from the independence promised by the British to the Arabs, and requested by Hussein of Mecca for Arab cantons. Neither side mentioned southern Palestine, the Mutasarriflik of Jerusalem or the Jewish people--at all.<br />Further maps also evidence the eagerness of Arab property owners to sell waste land to Jewish settlers at very high prices, for very large tracts were made available.<br />Still others show the locations of Arab attacks on Jewish communities beginning in 1882. Through 1914, bands of Arabs assaulted at least 10 Jewish settlements between Jaffa and Jerusalem and in the Jezreel Valley.<br />From 1920 on, the maps show progressively more attacks, in which Arab assailants destroyed the new landowners' forests, wheat fields, orange groves and cattle, burned and stoned their shops and factories--and murdered unarmed Jews.<br />A March 1920 attack by a large number of Halsa Arabs on the Jews in Tel Hai killed six; an April 1920 attack on B'nai Yehuda killed one. In May 1921, Arab riots prompted Britain, the League of Nations' trustee of all Middle Eastern Mandates, to end Jewish immigration and \\"close settlement of the land\\" throughout Transjordan, both of which the League had sought, with Arab approval, only a few years earlier. Only these attacks, and the Arab 1929 riots that killed 20 Jewish children and elders in Safed, 7 in Hacarmel, 6 in Motza, 1 in Hulda, 6 in Tel Aviv, 2 in Beer Toviya--and 59 in Hebron-- persuaded previously passive Jewish farmers to take up arms, thereby defying British prohibitions against Jewish self-defense.<br />The fact is, Arab riots occurred well in advance of Israel's creation. They took scores of Jewish civilian lives. And then (in 1921)--as now--the only Arabs killed by Jews were killed in counter-attacks that followed the initial Arab assaults.<br />All this shows clearly on the maps before reaching page 14.<br />From here, the pictorials exhibit the precise dimensions of the 1936 Arab riots, with one page devoted to each of four months. The casualties to Jewish life and property were massive and nationwide. More riots in 1937 and 1938 followed.<br />Most enlightening of all, however, are those maps detailing the various partition plans over the years. The first of these, which the Jewish people accepted, and the Arabs rejected, was the 1937 Peel Commission proposal. The Peel Commission envisioned a tiny Jewish State, an L-shaped affair perhaps 6 or 8 miles-wide along the Mediterranean coast, from south of Rehovot to a few miles north of Acre with a northern corridor no more than 30 miles deep running from the coast, and inland on a border south of Afula to Beit Shean. Even this, the Jewish people accepted, and Arabs rejected.<br />But the Peel proposal was most remarkable for something else it inherently acknowledged: Jerusalem was not a \\"traditionally Arab city,\\" as modern-day news repeatedly misinforms us. Its population--which was centered in the Old City--was predominantly Jewish. Christians and Muslims were minorities.<br />Thus the Peel Commission assigned Jerusalem, Bethlehem and a roughly oval-shaped area surrounding them, to an international trust to be managed by Britain for the League of Nations.<br />When that plan foundered on the Arab refusals, two subsequent 1938 partition plans proposed assigning even larger areas to the international trust. The more significant of the pair was the British Woodhead plan, as it was none too sympathetic to Zioninsts. Nevertheless, Woodhead expanded the international area encompassing Jerusalem and Bethlehem to include \\"traditionally Arab Ramallah\\" as well.<br />It is a lot more difficult after consulting this book, to lay blame for the Arab Israeli conflict solely on Israel's doorstep. The pictures tell the story, which naturally makes this volume unpopular with anti-Israel polemicists.<br />Much daylight needs to shine on these facts: Israel could and would have been much smaller than it is today if only Arabs had in 1937 accepted any Jewish state. They didn't, although none of the current issues even existed in 1937. But then, they had begun attacking Jewish farmers decades before Israel had any borders at all.

No wonder Polish writer Bruno Schulz is best known for this novel, though it is little more than 120 pages. It is easily one of the most poetic and riveting novels of the 20th century. It was also Schulz' first. It was published in 1934 as \\"Cinnamon Shops.\\"<br /><br />Schulz was an artist before he was a writer. And in this novel, he paints with his words. (He had come to writing in thanks partly to the encouragement of the poet Deborah Vogel.)<br /><br />The novel opens with a scene from his family home. In July, when his father had gone \\"to take the waters,\\" Schulz was left with his mother and elder brother, \\"prey to the blinding white heat of the summer days.\\" Together, they dipped into a large volume of \\"holidays, its pages blazing with sunshine and scented with the sweet melting pulp of golden pears.\\" On luminous mornings, his mother Adela returned from the market \\"like Pomona emerging from the flames of day.\\" Everything that follows is a sensory feast.<br /><br />Schulz' images are sometimes surreal and the events of the book, bizarre and often amazing. His father, for example, being enamored of birds, virtually becomes one. He moves into the attic where birds of prey visit.<br /><br />The first edition was illustrated by several of Schulz' masterful drawings and etchings, made in his earlier artistic mode, all of them reproduced elsewhere. One entitled \\"The Table\\" illustrated a scene at the family house which the book elegantly retells.<br /><br />Born on July 12, 1892, Schulz was the third and youngest child of a merchant who lived and worked in Drohobycz his whole life. This novel, like all his artistic and written works, reflects his close connection to his family and place. It is filled with his uncles, aunts and cousins, though one can never tell precisely where the reality stops and the fantasy begins. The lines are seamless, as in an exquisite pastel.<br /><br />In 1939, the Soviets occupied eastern Poland. Schulz' friends helped him to stay in Drohobycz, though he could no longer teach. But in June 1941 when the Nazis occupied eastern Poland, Schulz was forced to live with the Viennese Nazi Felix Landau, who had a taste for art. Landau boasted of keeping a Jewish artist slave alive--on one daily bowl of soup and slice of bread. Schulz survived Landau's \\"protection\\" for a year. But, as the introduction notes, the Gestapo went on a rampage on Nov. 19, 1942, killing more than 150. Karl Guenther, a rival to Landau, shot Schulz in the head. A devoted friend buried him at night in a Jewish cemetery which has since disappeared, along with Schulz' grave.<br /><br />Schulz entrusted most of his writings to friends for safekeeping during the war. Most were also snuffed out, and his works lost.<br /><br />The true extent of his genius will probably never be known. We are fortunate that this book emerged from Poland before Schulz' world was consumed in flames.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A. Lappentasy begins. The lines are seamless, as in an exquisite pastel.

I'll probably try several.<br /><br />The book offers two sets of contents.<br /><br />One, as one would expect, lists sections in order of appearance. These divide the pages (and recipes) by courses, opening with 25 pages of \\"Tapas and Small Courses\\" (both cold and hot), 30 pages of \\"Soups,\\" 34 pages of \\"Sandwiches, Pizzas and Savory Tarts,\\" 70 pages of \\"Entrees and Accompaniments.\\"<br /><br />But the courses are ordered European-style. \\"Salads\\" come after the main course, and are followed by \\"Deserts,\\" \\"Breakfast and Brunch\\" and \\"The Cafe Pantry\\"--which includes several pages of staple recipes, like chicken, beef, veal and fish stock, vinaigrette, clarified butter, cr&egrave;me fraiche, cr&egrave;me Anglaise and, for cooks who prefer everything from scratch, pizza dough.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for specifics, one must skip to the second contents, which follows a 3-page introduction. Only there are the recipes listed. Alas, these are not in order of appearance, but in the order they would be served. To complicate matters further, the detailed contents are arranged alphabetically by CITY, and only then under the name of the originating caf&eacute;.<br /><br />Thus, Atlanta appears first, but none of the 10 recipes from the Indigo Coastal Grill can be found near any of its others. Indigo's opening Oriental Oysters course is on page 59, the main course Red Snapper in Melon Sauce lands on page 182 and the Poppyseed Parfait with Blueberry Coulis on page 190 (and to top it off, the page number is mistaken).<br /><br />Serious cooks and novices alike might enjoy these recipes. Most look fairly simple and quick.<br /><br />The arrangement, however--though from premiere American caf&eacute;s like Clancy's and Napoleon House in New Orleans, Washington Square in San Francisco, Caf&eacute; Guadeloupe in Santa Fe and Monique's in Chicago--is definitely frustrating.<br /><br />Thank heavens for indexes.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

With only the book's strange ideas to go on, Western readers might easily conclude that its authors were unreal, but the news at present is filled with the deeds of such thinkers.<br /><br />As explained herein, the author's name is a pseudonym, not for one person, but a group who call themselves \\"leaders of the Congress of the Sunni Sect of Islam.\\" They claim \\"nonalignment and neutral status within the political party arena of these United States.\\" While nominally U.S. citizens, these authors consider themselves non-allied.<br /><br />Soon enough, they contradict that claim, announcing themselves as heirs to the World War II \\"Axis powers\\" and those Middle Eastern \\"Islamic powers\\" that transferred authority and wealth \\"to their black children\\" in 1944 or 1945 as the Axis faced certain defeat.<br /><br />The authors pay homage to Hazrat Mirza Qhulam Ahmed, the 19th century Indian founder of the Ahmadiyya movement, which many (perhaps most) Sunni Muslims consider a heretic sect --- owing to Ahmed's reputed claim to be a prophet. (The Ahmadiyyas insist he never made this claim). According to Patrick Sookhdeo ([[ASIN:1857927850 A People Betrayed]]) and Ibn Warraq ([[ASIN:1591020115 Why I Am Not a Muslim]]) Ahmadiyyas are an oppressed Pakistani minority.<br /><br />Whether this text accurately represents Ahmadiyya views, I cannot judge.<br /><br />Of its own accord, the text appears virtually worthless, excepting for intelligence on how some of America's enemies think.<br /><br />The book claims that Islam is superior to all other faiths and will ultimately assume control of the entire world. It also claims that Islam offers a vision of peace. It announces the \\"beginning of the Muslim era.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, the peace envisioned by this slight 117-page volume can be achieved only at such time as all mankind accepts Islam and all land worldwide becomes an Islamic \\"trust\\" (or waqf).<br /><br />Such a \\"peace\\" would, by its own definition, eliminate all religious (and cultural) diversities among men, making its conception of peace, also by definition, severely flawed.<br /><br />Even without these elements, the book is sadly deficient. For it also exposes the authors' intense dislike for Western civilization, ideas and liberties.<br /><br />The authors pretend to condemn all violence done in Islam's name--especially the atrocities on September 11 2001.<br /><br />They also pretend to apologize for historical and current \\"Islamic thoughts and practices\\" that have \\"been the cause of millions of people being killed and millions of other people being homeless\\" (p.4). They even allow, \\"In the name of few if any religions have more wrongs been done to humanity than those done in the name of\\" their sect of Islam (p. 29).<br /><br />These would be incredible, historic Islamic admissions of guilt, except that the book provides only one remedy for all wrongs \\"done in Allah's name:\\" Simply, that \\"the day of judgment that awaits us.\\" That's it. All wrongs committed in Islam's name are excused as \\"the misunderstanding of Holy Prophet's mandate from God....\\"<br /><br />Supposedly Islam holds \\"there is no compulsion in religion.\\" But the authors also provide an apologia of Mohammed's \\"wars of conversion of the children of Ishmael\\" (p. 79). They were committed \\"out of love for mankind.\\" The early Islamic conquests were \\"retaliation undertaken\\" by mystical Islamic leaders \\"after attacks upon holy places in the doctrines of Islam, after attacks upon the members of the mystical body of Islam\\" and after attacks on people whom Islam establishes as \\"international in dimension and character, and without national boundaries\\" (pp. 79-81).<br /><br />In plain English, this reads like an excuse to attack anyone, on any pretext, anywhere, provided that a Muslim judges the victim opposed to Islam. And indeed, the writers earlier explained that when and where ever Muslims are \\"threatened\\" (whatever that means), \\"we will take appropriate military action\\" (p. 23). They add, \\"mercy doesn't manifest itself by way of gentleness in all circumstances\\" (p. 23-4).<br /><br />It's hard to believe that these writers belong to an oppressed Pakistani sect, so explicit are their dislikes of others.<br /><br />They label all Westerners who disavow Islam as \\"fascists,\\" implicitly inferior \\"to the House of Ishmael.\\" While pretending to have sympathy, they openly deride adherents to \\"the Bible, or the Torah.\\" Christians and Jews, according to their creed, are \\"racists\\" (p. 29).<br /><br />They describe the world's current leaders as \\"the progeny of white Nordic barbarians\\" (p. 29). Europeans are \\"white barbarians from the north\\" (p. 30). Despite Western tolerance of societies and cultures unlike ours, these authors condemn \\"white Nordic racists\\" and \\"their American counterparts\\" who pretend to be \\"superior\\" (p. 29).<br /><br />The world's \\"new definition of morality,\\" they claim, should \\"come from Islam\\" (p.6). Only this path, they say, offers \\"life-affirming holiness.\\"<br /><br />Islam, the authors claim, is on a journey \\"toward perfection\\" and a \\"return to a habitat\\" including God's presence.<br /><br />Alas, their vision of \\"peace,\\" by their own words, is grossly exclusionary and hateful, as it counts all non-Muslims as barbarians and racists.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

But most critical, he ties the actions and comments of radical and moderate Muslims alike to sacred Islamic texts and jurists considered central by many if not all.<br /><br />That Spencer, a Melkite Christian and the grandson of dhimmis, has studied Islam for decades could hardly be in doubt. For his grasp and understanding Islamic texts and liturgy is truly breathtaking. His examination is not spiritual in nature, of course.<br /><br />Yet Spencer turns ably from al-Mawardi's Laws of Islamic Governance to verses of the Qu'ran to Ibn Khaldun's Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History without blinking. Always, he relates critical passages of these historical and sacred documents and texts to current events.<br /><br />I have read many histories and analyses of Islamic history in recent years, and say without reservation that Spencer's book is one of the most useful of the lot. For he explains, unlike virtually any other scholar, the religious lynchpins, or triggers, for much that is happening in our world.<br /><br />Policymakers especially should take heed, as Spencer zeros in on the persistent reality Western civilization cannot afford to ignore: the Islamic religious imperatives to jihad, or sacred war.<br /><br />Whether readers are just beginning to ask what makes Islam tick, or advanced in their studies, Onward Muslim Soldiers offers salient and critical material not to be missed.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Unlike Jean Sasson's Princess, which I read when it came out in 1992, this one reveals real identities to go with the very disturbing details. For courage alone, I give Parvin Darabi four stars.<br />The book is an anecdotal personal story, based entirely on experiences. That's fine, as far as it goes. Clearly, based on this account, Iranian men control women's lives, offering them little freedom. But enormous abuses are also described here, and one comes away wondering how pervasive these might be. Most likely, no studies exist.<br />But I most missed political and social context. The authors did not report, for example, the UN General Assembly resolution condemning Iran's corporeal punishments (flogging and stoning), often meted out to youngsters under 18--or that Iranian figures such as former Attorney General Ayatollah Morteza Moqtadai and Judiciary Head Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi approve of these punishments for moral crimes. They also omit Iranian constitutional provisions requiring the government to export radical Islam.<br />Poor writing and a weak structure also detract from the work.<br />Nevertheless, the book is worth reading.

He died in Israel that year. Shadow themes and images subtly bleed through the skin of this work, in a pentimento effect that renders these 61 Eddie Levenston translations subtle, bold, and classic.<br />Kovner was a Jewish Holocaust and Israeli wartime hero, larger-than-life, and one of Israel's most important poets. But these works, in a voice intensely human despite the enormous events that shaped it, describe the loss of his voice to cancer.<br />Sloan Kettering nevertheless avoids self-pity or sturm und drang. Kovner regards his sons' photos and asks, \\"in their presence/ may one cry?\\" He speaks in understated irony. His grandchildren came for Hanukkah. \\"I didn't/ sing 'Ma'oz Tsur with them, you know why.\\" He looses senses, without complaint, but will tell of it another time \\"if there is one.\\" Of course, there won't be any more conversations. \\"Just as this one is no more/than the invention of a throat in ruins.\\"<br />Kovner's past is his \\"burden of molten/ rocks.\\" He wants this to \\"stay in the archives/ it is not for the operating table.\\"<br />One poem instructing his heirs includes the first two words of the mourners' Kaddish -- Yitgadal veyitkadash (magnified and sanctified). Kovner next notes the greater suffering of others--and remembers God, reciting the prayer's third and fourth words--shemei rabba (is the Name).<br />He relives his fight for the survival of the Europe's Jews. He shudders here, like he did then, \\"challenged to stand up for his right/ to live.\\" Expecting another time when the world would again oppose the Jewish people, Kovner presciently warns, \\"The worst of all comes back.\\" He asks, \\"Will we ever/ get out of this terrible forest?\\"<br />In Sloan Kettering's silence echoes the great silence 65 years ago, when Jews had no idea where to turn and a Jewish prisoner was \\"cut off from his supervisor,\\" lost and running from room to room....<br />One encounters again \\"a pathless wilderness/ between yellow arrows/ and blue signs.\\" Reflecting his furtive life in Nazi-occupied Vilna, he calls the New York cancer center \\"a trans-life corridor.\\"<br />The fingers of a black nurse mirror \\"the velvet pad where Mother/ kept her needles.\\" Impossible circumstances forced Kovner to abandon her to save others. His mind and heart, however, never left her. His nights end by telling her of his fears, and about her grandchildren. \\"She should have a little joy/in Ponar.\\"<br />He recalls Itzik Wittenburg, betrayed to the Nazis on July 16, 1943, who hoped that going along would save others. In his cell, he swallowed prussic acid. \\"The gate is still open.\\" ... \\"a nation holding its breath.\\"<br />Kovner 's metaphors also reflect the life that cancer patients struggle to keep, against hope and time. In a sense, they capture it too. Kovner describes a Thai man. His face looks like \\"Lost parchment/ in the heart of the desert.\\"<br />Kovner understandably has no more \\"trust in the mercy of heaven,\\" recalling \\"the day he lost patience waiting/ for the echo of his cry...to come back from empty space.\\" Yet like all his work, these poems invoke Jewish prayers, themes and biblical proportions, some (though not all) detailed in the endnotes.<br />Readers may recognize Psalm 114 in Kovner's \\"mountains of Palmyra,\\" where advanced radio-telescopes cause their planners to rejoice \\"like young goats.\\"<br />They scan the universe's secrets, whose \\"ends flee and escape/...beyond space.\\" This is Kovner's Jordan that fled backward. The cancer in his throat is like \\"An abyss fine as a pinhead/ in ambush,\\" whose mysterious patience resembles \\"the galaxies of emptiness/beyond the black holes....\\"<br />These poems come as close as any to capturing absolute truth--that strangely elusive engine, invisible to most people most of the time, which poets spend their lives seeking to record. Kovner offers muted, simple humility. He writes so delicately of massacre and genocide--terms now bloodied by false invocation and overuse--that even readers unaware of his history, will find these poems pristine, awesome and beyond reproach.<br />--Alyssa A.

A former U.S. Marine who heads the Selous Foundation in Washington D.C., the author seems to comprehend the major articles of Islamic faith, tradition, law and history concerning enshrined Muslim war doctrine.<br />The author carefully points out that since Islam holds Muhammad the last Prophet of God on earth, whatever was revealed to him \\"represents God's last word on the subject.\\" As he notes, this unquestioning acceptance of Islamic dogma fixes a dilemma at the heart of Islamic life: How can the Muslim world adjust its 7th century theology to live at peace with 21st century non-Muslims and Western civilization?<br />Norval notes that Islamic law, or Shari'a as known to Muslims, derives from four sources in the following order of priority: Koran (supposed to be the revelations of Allah to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel, and therefore unquestionable); the Prophet's sayings and traditions or Hadith; legal consensus of Islamic jurists (e.g. Shafi'i jurist al-Mawardi, d. 1058, and the Maliki, Ibn Kaldun, d. 1046) and finally Islamic scholars' analogical reasoning.<br />The author allows that the fourth source of Islamic law holds the key to 21st century Islamic reform. But he also believes strict limitations within the bounds of authenticated and accepted words and deeds of the Prophet very nearly fixes even modern-day itijihad--the interpretive reasoning by general consensus of Islamic religious leaders or ulema--in stone from the outset.<br />While Islamic consensus continued to develop through the 10th century, Norval contends, learned Islamic legal scholars subsequently decided also by consensus that virtually everything open to interpretation by general agreement \\"was complete. Nothing more was to be done. Independent reasoning-itijihad--was no longer necessary.\\"<br />Such thinking naturally tends to reject Western-style political norms, coalition-building and compromise and relegate them and Western logic, reasoning and thinkers (definitively including traditional Western liberals in this category) to what fundamentalist Muslims consider the forces of Satan. This limits Islamic openness to change, Norval contends, and would explain why Muslim world \\"disagreements can quickly escalate into bloody violence.\\"<br />The frank discussion provides a healthy and robust consideration of Islam's effects on the Muslim and modern worlds.<br />This would probably offend anyone who considers questions or criticism of Islamic precepts equivalent to hatred of all Islamic persons and things.<br />Unfortunately, however, the Islamic world's current political and economic states seem to demand precisely such questioning and criticism as this refreshing book might generate among those willing to consider its arguments.<br />My biggest criticism concerns Norval's complete lack of footnotes and bibliography. Fortunately, in most instances, he attributes to authors by name directly within his text. Alas, he does not always provide specific titles or articles from which he draws, making it impossible in those cases for diligent researchers to follow up further.<br />The discussion, however, is most enlightening, and in line with much offered by other eminent scholars of Islamic law and jurisprudence.<br />--Alyssa A.

This effort is an abysmal failure.<br /><br />For one thing, the supposed Zionist transfer &#34;discussions&#34; Masalha cites were never part of mainstream Zionist political discourse or policy. He claims modern Zionism founder Theodore Herzl seriously discussed transfer. But Herzl merely discussed plans to buy land thereby transferring it from Arab to Jewish owners by legal means of purchase under the Ottoman Land Law of 1858. Herzl saw this as an eminently moral course, one not followed by any previous settlement movement.<br /><br />He planned for Zionists to pay fair market value--and that's what happened. In fact, Jewish purchasers often paid far more than market value. (Besides, the Ottoman government held more than 80 percent of the land in Israel; it wasn't owned by anyone.)<br /><br />Another major difficulty is Masalha's avoidance of declared 1948 Arab plans to annihilate the Jewish people and Israel. After all, this caused Arab flight from Israel; Without that war, the 1948 &#34;transfer&#34;--actually a conflict-bred refugee crisis--would not have occurred. And the Arabs declared the war. Masalha's claim that Israel pre-planned this doesn't track with actual events. Indeed, 1 million Arabs hold Israeli citizenship, with all attendant civil rights.<br /><br />Contrary to Masalha's contention, the &#34;population transfer&#34; idea was not a Jewish, Zionist or Israeli idea. It was born in the 1920s, not the 1890s, and the term was first used to describe a 1920s Turkish-Greek population exchange. In Israel, the concept was first floated in the 1937 by Britain's Peel Commission, not Zionists. They wanted to transfer an Arab minority from a tiny Jewish state as part of a partition plan to further subdivide Western Mandate Palestine, which the British had already unilaterally divided from Eastern Mandate Palestine in 1922. David Ben Gurion actually opposed the plan at first.<br /><br />Masalha claims the Zionists were behind the Peel Commission transfer proposal. But he really doesn't prove this point. In fact, David Ben-Gurion welcomed Britain's transfer idea reluctantly--and only to persuade Zionists to accept a sliver Jewish state. But in doing so, Ben Gurion also warned that the Peel plan contained inherent dangers. In any case, the transfer idea fizzled when the Zionists accepted it reluctantly and the Arabs opposed the proposed partition.<br /><br />Masalha is unconvincing not least because only Israel's tiny revisionist faction incorporated transfer into an official party platform. And revisionists--who didn't adopt the notion until well after the 1948 war--never exercised major influence over Israel's labor Zionist mainstream.<br /><br />Masalha forgets that early Zionist leaders expected Israel to obtain a Jewish majority from massive immigration. They believed (rightly, as we now know) that Western Palestine could accommodate millions of Jews and Arabs, up from 600,000 or so inhabitants in the 1920s, most of them fairly recent immigrants.<br /><br />And finally, despite his wish to blame Zionists for planning a population transfer, Masalha neglects transfers forced on Jewish residents and landowners in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s by Arab riots and massacres. The ancient Jewish community of Hebron, for example, was wiped out in 1929 with the massacre of 70 unarmed Jewish civilians. Egypt likewise illegally removed Jewish residents of Gaza with its illegal 1948 occupation there, as did Jordan when it illegally seized the Jordan River's west bank in 1948 and forced 100,000 Jewish Jerusalemites to leave their ancient homes, tipping East Jerusalem's population balance from two thirds Jewish to 100 percent Arab.<br /><br />This book is completely unconvincing. Masalha steeps his text in theory, but he does not prove it with historical facts.<br /><br />--Alyssa A. Lappenlyssa A. Lappen	2003-11-07

This will be useful and interesting to anyone honoring those who risked their lives to save others.<br /><br />This book is valuable in its own right. It honors the dead, and those who worked to save the living. It's certainly a good companion to Key's Final Report. It's also useful for readers interested in coordinating data available on the attack.<br /><br />But it doesn't examine questions about perpetrators, motives, and investigations concerning the attacks, all of which still need a lot more answers.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Another tells of some man-sized camp pancakes, bigger than a house.<br />Then there's the time old Bill was chased by a sleeping bear. He ran like a demon but the bear took hold of his suspenders, and old Bill wasn't getting too far. So he snapped back those suspenders, sending the bear reeling back near on 100 yards.<br />Bill took off like a demon and that sleeping bear followed hard on his tail. So Bill climbed up an elm tree. He went so fast, Bill climbed 40 feet over the tree top before realizing he'd run out of branches to grab. He had to climb back down right quick, before he started to fall.<br />He sat in that tree, with the bear down below holding Bill's empty shotgun. The bear waved his massive paws for Bill to throw down some shotgun shells. Now Bill was no dummy, so he knew just what to do.<br />More than once, Bill sounds like he's from Chelm, that mythic Eastern European town where foolish bakers worry about preserving the holes in their bagels, and the wise men, how to catch the moon in a barrel.<br />Of course, some people would believe anything under the sun, and a lot that isn't. Thank goodness, kids aren't that silly. Nope, on hearing these tall tales, they just laugh a lot.<br />--Alyssa A. Lappen	2003-11-03

This is the remnant of the Middle East's oldest Jewish community outside Israel--dating from 563 B.C.E. (after Jerusalem's first Jewish Temple was destroyed). This elegant book's 25 essays by Persian Jews detail Iranian Jewish history and culture, as well as some of the repressions that arrived with Islam's advent and worsened markedly under the Safavids beginning in 1501, possibly a result of Shi'ite religious wars with Sunni Turkey.<br /><br />Whatever the cause, however, this book provides a welcome window onto harsh Islamic treatment of non-Muslims, actualized through the religious ordinances (fatwas) of Iranian mullahs that ruled \\"impure\\" all infidels--Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, Hindus, Buddhists and others--and also Sunni Muslims.<br /><br />As Hooshang Ebrami explains in \\"The Impure Jew,\\" for example, Iran's Islam imposed special degradations on one of its oldest minorities, rejecting them \\"as impure human beings.\\" Institutional humiliations and limitations varied over time, Ebrami writes, yet \\"never ceased since the advent of Islam in Iran.\\" Umar II (717 to 720) reduced the status of non-Muslims under the restrictive Shorut laws that became more resptrictive and oppressive with time. According to these religious laws, for example, simply touching those outside the faith rendered Muslims impure. Thus religious laws strictly prohibited Muslim-Jewish (and indeed, Muslim-Christian) friendships as mortal sins.<br /><br />While the idea of unclean persons may have originated with non-monotheistic Zoroastrian and Hindu doctrines, Ebrami notes that the Koran expanded upon this according to faith: \\"O you who believe, the idolaters are surely unclean, so they shall not approach the sacred Mosque.\\" (IX: 28).<br /><br />The Shi'ite clergy increasingly upped the ante on Judeophobic regulations that worsened the economic and living conditions of \\"impure\\" Jews, Ebrami notes. Jews were \\"considered as unclean and polluting as dogs or pigs (not to mention urine or feces) and contact with them was shunned.\\" Islamic jurist Mohammad Baqer Majlesi (d. 1699) under Shah Abbas II imposed laws that further protected Muslims by preventing their physical contact of any kind with \\"impure\\" Jews. These daily humiliations stripped Jews of even those flimsy rights that Iranian Islam had previously allowed.<br /><br />Now, Jews could not give children Muslim names, read the Koran, hold public office, have shops in the bazaar, open shops on city streets--or even leave home when it rained. Muslims could murder Jews and go free, Ebrami writes, by paying a small blood price. On pain of death, Jews had to wear special hats and red clothing patches; remain silent and bow their heads while Muslims cursed them; and remain home after drinking wine, (required in Jewish rituals), or immediately be killed upon leaving. Even painting a room white in their homes could earn them a death sentence.<br /><br />Jews for the most part lived in the \\"mahalleh,\\" an Islamic equivalent of European ghettoes that centuries of \\"discrimination, marginalization, and disenfranchisement\\" earned them negative connotations. But even during the secular Pahlavi dynasty, when Iran's ruling elite gutted Sh'ite religious power, giving Iranian Jews more freedom than they had since 717, one learns here that harsh discriminatory regulations remained in force.<br /><br />The memoirs of Hakham Yedidia Shofet, an eminent Pahlavi era rabbi, for example recall that near Kahsan's mahalleh was a large mosque with a courtyard attached via a short pathway to the bazaar. As Ebrami notes, this could have allowed Jews a quick shortcut to the market, but Islamic laws still prevented Jews from setting their \\"impure feet\\" on the mosque courtyard, on pain of death. To save their wives a half-hour walk around, several prominent Jews petitioned the local mullah for access through the yard--noting that impure dogs, cats, donkeys and camels routinely used it. The mullah declined them. \\"Jews are najes and therefore not allowed to come close to the Muslims' mosque,\\" he told them.<br /><br />Following the revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini strengthened such dhimma laws still further.<br /><br />This book shows that while Jews lived a rich and productive life over centuries in Iran, they did so in spite of Islamic oppression, not thanks to its tolerance. In other words, Iran's Jews were no better off than their European counterparts, and in fairly recent times, fared considerably worse.<br /><br />A highly educational volume.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Her narrator tells of an uncle, charged with war crimes, who hides under the kitchen table yelling: &#34;The Israelis are coming to get me!&#34;<br /><br />The novel opens as Soviet Jewish &#34;commissars&#34; arrive in Ukraine. The narrator alleges that they inflicted famine and suffering. That, she claims, &#34;was how the hate started.&#34; As her uncle goes to trial, the narrator says, &#34;My sister is starting to hate, my sister who never hated anything.&#34;<br /><br />Far from historical truth, this book is something of &#34;an apologia for genocide,&#34; as French resistance veteran and Melbourne University historian Jacques Adler observed. It ignores the 17th century Ukrainian nationalist rebellion that killed tens of thousands of Jews as well as the Ukrainian murders of 100,000 Jews during the 1918 civil war. It portrays sympathetically a man who machine-gunned thousands and bayoneted a baby.<br /><br />Demidenko blamed Jews for the Ukraine famine, which she claimed had caused Ukrainians to join the Nazi genocide of Jews, and made their actions understandable. These controversial claims generated news coverage, book sales, and possibly influenced judges for Australia's Vogel Literary prize, Miles Franklin award and Literature Society Gold Medal, all of which the book won.<br /><br />Of course, the book generated a great deal of criticism, since Stalin actually caused the Ukrainian famine, as Robert Conquest's Harvest of Sorrow shows conclusively. Among the critics were Melbourne Age columnist Pamela Bone, novelist and Vogel judge Roger McDonald, and Sydney Institute director Gerard Henderson, who believed the book unjustly forgave Ukrainian Nazi collaborators for Jew-hatred and murder. Some termed the novel an apologia for genocide. Critics expected it to comfort &#34;racists and antisemites&#34; from Australia to Russa.<br /><br />Shortly after the novel's fourth paperback printing, Demidenko's high-school headmaster identified her and publicly exposed her claims and supposed family history as false. She is really Helen Darville, the daughter of English immigrants.<br /><br />To her credit, Darville apologized publicly in August 1995, according to the Jerusalem Post. She had not taken oral family testimonies. Her father's family was not &#34;killed by&#34; Ukrainian &#34;Jewish communists.&#34; Her father was Harry Darville. Her parents met in Scunthorpe England, not on a refugee ship.<br /><br />Darville's false claims did huge harm. But to her further enormous credit, September 11, 2001 changed her heart. Australian newspaper reactions to the atrocities elicited Darville's public mea culpa in which she also condemned those who were &#34;parroting Saddam Hussein and Mullah Mohammad Omar.&#34; (Sydney Morning Herald, &#34;Were we U.S.-Bashers Wrong all Along?&#34; Oct. 1, 2001)<br /><br />A Democrat and daughter of a Green, Darville admitted that she had previously so actively siphoned &#34;blame away from the perpetrators of violent crime&#34; that her friends termed her views &#34;parodic&#34; and &#34;Pythonesque.&#34; She wrote that her attitude had encouraged her to &#34;take swipes at Israel and the Jewish lobby,&#34; and accuse both &#34;without distinction&#34; of reverse racism, and of exploiting the Holocaust for territorial gain.<br /><br />But Darville reported her disgust when Palestinians cheered and &#34;ululated with joy&#34; as &#34;planes carved into skyscrapers.&#34; The author-turned-teacher wrote that she was further sickened by repeated, widespread Palestinian hatred that went widely unreported, since the PA had &#34;been busily preventing further filming.&#34; One BBC correspondent had sent her &#34;a distraught email:&#34; Yasser Arafat's police had &#34;destroyed his camera and opened his head up with a truncheon.&#34;<br /><br />Darville now reviled the notion that Americans should simultaneously &#34;accept every carping criticism of their foreign policy (Israel, Iraq, Chile, etc),&#34; along with murders of several thousand civilians and &#34;respond peacefully.&#34; She now recognized that international cries to &#34;End support for Israel&#34; contained a &#34;large amount of submerged anti-Semitism,&#34; which directly blamed Israel's &#34;brutality towards the Palestinians&#34; for the &#34;attacks on America.&#34;<br /><br />Darville rightly concluded that these arguments blurred the line between &#34;atrocity, and what one condones.&#34; She explained that writing this book had also tempted her to adopt such reasoning, &#34;We all know the Holocaust was heinous, but...&#34;<br /><br />But now she recognized that Bin Laden, Mullah Omar and their anti-American Pakistani and Palestinian supporters wanted &#34;to see all Jews dead.&#34; Writing this book had taught her about Nazi propaganda, she now reported, and the actions of those who currently supported such propaganda had crystallized for her their true intentions. &#34;These people hate Jews so much that, consciously or unconsciously, they've come to identify with Nazis,&#34; she wrote.<br /><br />She now reviled the attacks on America and Israel as well as those taking &#34;the same glib and facile path I once took--thereby absolving not only the terrorists, but their state sponsors, of blame.&#34; She asked readers to stop blurring the &#34;fine line between understanding and condoning atrocity.&#34; Well said, indeed.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

There Jews had long beards and black coats that reached their ankles --- but were not quite like other Jews.<br /><br />In the spring after a very hard winter, they built a wall around their town to keep the cold out. Later, they invited an organist to play for the town --- although there was not a single organ in Helm.<br /><br />The world came to regard them as fools. An angel had been flying over Helm en route to heaven with a sack full of fools in need of repair when the bottom caught on a treetop and all the fools fell into the valley town of Helm, where they remained. The Helmites insisted that they were not the fools. \\"It's just that foolish things are always happening to us,\\" explained Mottel.<br /><br />For example, since thieves always steal at night, the Helm shopkeepers kept their stores open at night and slept by day. When no one came to their stores, they decided instead to hire a night watchman --- who wore an inside out fur coat to be recognized, sat on a horse and guarded the shops.<br /><br />But one fine morning, the watchman woke the townspeople. Their shops were emptied in the night. Furious, they dragged him to the Rabbi. He said, \\"I admit I saw the thieves break the locks. With my own eyes I watched them carrying the wares out of the shops. But I could do nothing.\\" Why? Because his horse was tied to the post near town hall, far away from the shops, and untying it was too risky. The horse might gallop off and kill him.<br /><br />With thieves in town, the Helmites decided there was no justice, and sent two messengers to buy some and bring it back to Helm, for rich and poor alike. The Helmites rode all the way to Warsaw, searching all the stores.<br /><br />\\"Look no further,\\" two rogues told them, \\"We'll sell you as much justice as you want.\\" For 2,000 pieces of gold, the rogues a few hours later delivered a full barrel of justice, nailed tight and sealed all around, warning the Helmites, \\"More sure not to jostle it on your way. You know how hard it is to get justice these days.\\"<br /><br />When they got back to Helm, however, and reverently lifted the cover on the barrel, they smelled bad fish. \\"Justice of the world smells bad,\\" they cried. \\"Woe! What shall we do?\\"<br /><br />Whereupon Gimpel exclaimed, \\"That is the kind of justice you have in the rest of the world!\\"<br /><br />After a great fire in Helm, the Rabbi consoled the people with the news that they could now expand their Synagogue, making it as large as Gimpel's potato patch. The Warsaw Jews gave money to their Helm brothers to fund the construction. But, carrying a great fortune, and convinced by scoundrels that they would be robbed on the road, the Helmites decided to buy feathers--which are light. And feathers, if stolen, could unlike money not be concealed by the thieves. Once back in Helm, they would sell the feathers and use the money to rebuild their Synagogue.<br /><br />They set out back to Helm, and when a favorable wind arose, they reasoned that by releasing the feathers they could save themselves the trouble of carrying them. They let the feathers fly. Once back in Helm, the people cheered their heroes' return. And what of the feathers? \\"When you grow up,\\" Gimpel told a saucy lad, \\"you'll understand that if a man can sometimes be late, surely feathers can also be late.\\"<br /><br />When after weeks the feathers had still not arrived, the Helmites decided to seek them in the larger world.

His mother sent older friends to supervise his first independent market trip.<br /><br />The Catholic boy nicknamed Piol, for rain, that day lost his childhood and world to the murahaliin. After torching the nearby villages and slaying their inhabitants, 20 light-skinned Juur horsemen charged into Nyamlell. They severed the heads of all Dinka men with single sword strokes, left them rolling in the blood-soaked market dust and stole Piol's older friends Abuk, Kwol and Nyabol. A rifleman permanently silenced a crying girl with a bullet to her head. A swordsman sliced off her sister's leg at the thigh. Francis tried to flee. Terror squelched his cries. He was halted at gunpoint, grabbed and slung astride a small saddle, crafted specifically (as he later recognized) to carry abducted children, and ridden far north.<br /><br />Bok recounts the role he played in pushing President Bush to toughen and sign the Sudan Peace Act on October 18, 2002. As he points out, this made Americans increasingly aware of Sudanese Islamic government support for mass enslavement and genocide of Southern Sudanese Christians and animists.<br /><br />But as he also notes, while there may be some kind Muslims, the ongoing genocide against 2 million Southern Sudanese Dinka is merely a modern manifestation of Islamic tradition in Sudan and elsewhere throughout North Africa.<br /><br />Francis Bok recognized in his treatment an institutionalized cruelty. He was beaten, forced to tend and sleep with animals, fed rotting meat, and cursed as a jedut ---  maggot --- even after his master pressed a Muslim name and prayers on him. Abdul Rahman ironically means \\"servant of the compassionate one.\\" But there was not one second of compassion during Bok's 10 years of captivity, although he was one of the lucky ones.<br /><br />He many times tried to escape, and failed. His penalties were mere beatings. Other Dinka escapees routinely lost their limbs when recaptured. Giemma Abdullah threatened the same; Bok didn't believe him, until he saw other Dinkas, limbless. Finally, at 17, Francis Bok took the cows one morning, and from the road near their grazing area ran all the way to Mutari. After further privations and imprisonments, Bok finally hid in a truck en route to ed-Da'ein, fled to Khartoum, to Cairo, and as a refugee, in 1999, to the U.S. He landed in the U.S. poor, illiterate, and 20.<br /><br />But Bok admits that he was like all its victims unaware of the jihad institution's name or history. During 10 long years of enslavement by Giemma Abdullah in Kerio, Bok learned that the Arabic word abeed carried three meanings --- \\"slave,\\" \\"black\\" and \\"filth.\\" Half his lifetime among Muslims taught him that they considered themselves better than Southern Sudanese infidels. But this hardly educated him on the institution to which his 20th century captors and masters subjected him.<br /><br />The privations Bok suffered and the constant jihad in Sudan are typical of those suffered by non-Muslims, as pre-eminent Islamic scholar Bat Ye'or notes in [[ASIN:1611471362 The Decline of Eastern Christianity]]. Rudolf C. Slatin's [[ASIN:1853670820 Fire and Sword in the Sudan: A Personal Narrative of Fighting and Serving the Dervishes, 1879-1895]], recounts 10 years of captivity by Khalifa Abdullah, searching for slaves and booty in Christian and animist regions.

This book provides an excellent start to that lesson.<br /><br />It opens with an order of the Seder meal, illustrated with colorful and somehow very realistic clay figures showing each part of the service.<br /><br />From beginning to end, each page also includes large vibrant illustrations--photographs of clay figurines, actually--that bring the Passover story alive for children and adults alike. The book opens with Passover table set with clay candles, wine, Haggadah, matzoh and a clay Seder plate containing all the symbols to be used in the retelling of the Jewish people's escape from slavery in Egypt thousands of years ago. (These are of course a roasted lamb bone, hard boiled egg, maror or bitter vegetable, chopped fruit, and greens to dip in the salt water that symbolizes tears.)<br /><br />Blessings for all the major portions of the service are included in Hebrew and English.<br /><br />The Four Questions--undoubtedly the highlight of the Passover Seder for all children who must ask them--are likewise included in Hebrew and English, beginning with \\"How different this night is from every other night of the year. Every other night we eat bread or matzah. Why do we eat only matzah tonight?\\"<br /><br />A clay figure of a bow-tied young boy wearing a kipah appears at the Seder table to encourage children to proceed with their questions, which for shy ones can be very daunting indeed.<br /><br />The best part of the Haggadah, though, comes in the retelling of the Passover story, complete with clay illustrations of ancient Jewish people forced to build the Egyptian Pharaoh's pyramids and the ten plagues that God sent to Egypt when Pharaoh refused to grant Moses plea.<br /><br />Children love the illustrations of traditional Passover songs like Had Gadya, as well as those of sages of old, Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah, Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Tarfon discussing the Passover story until the wee hours of the night. Kids even like the clay figures of idols that the Jewish people were instructed not to worship.<br /><br />The Haggadah service closes with the ancient prayer of Jews whose ancestors were forced to leave their beloved Jerusalem by waves of conquerors through the ages, \\"Next year in Jerusalem,\\" and a two-page color spread of the spiritual capital established by King David in Biblical times.<br /><br />But the story and the playfulness don't end there. The final illustration shows a child crawling out from under the Seder table, triumphantly holding the Afikomen (dessert matzah) in his hands.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Here, he provides considerable evidence of Islam's institutional enslavement of children under the Seljuks and Ottomans, over 500 years, in Greece and Serbia.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this history seems very much alive in the Islamic wars against non-Muslims ongoing from Indonesia and Malaysia to the Philippines and southern Sudan. In any case, this book provides evidence that while the vast majority of Muslims may indeed be peaceful, their tolerance is less apparent in Islamic tradition and laws, as recorded by jurists from al-Mawardi to our own time, or by the historical record.<br /><br />Andric's history of classical Islam's European actions should give one pause, particularly since, as Robert Spencer explains in Onward Muslim Soldiers, classical Islam remains very much in vogue among radicals today.<br /><br />This book provides a much-needed snapshot of classical Islam's historical effects.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

The examination of records from 1830 onward will shock most readers.<br /><br />In the first place, the book shows that Palestine's population barely grew for 250 years--rising from 205,000 Moslems, Christians and Jews in 1554 to only 275,000 in 1800. In the second, records from 1830, 1863, 1878 and 1893 and 1917, among others, demonstrate that when the heaviest Jewish immigration began in 1880, a large proportion of the 425,000 to 440,000 Arabs in Palestine were themselves recent immigrants.<br /><br />The book also carefully documents the origins of those immigrants. Many came from Egypt: The 1831 invasion by the Egyptian Khedive, Ibrahim Pasha, forced Palestine fellaheen, urban dwellers and Bedouin to permanently flee Ottoman military drafts and taxes. The 1837 Great Earthquake and epidemics that followed further cut their numbers. In their wake came Ibrahim Pasha's Egyptian Arabs, who settled the empty land.  In 1831 alone, 6,000 Egyptian Arabs settled in Akko. The Egyptian Arab-Hinadi, Ghawarna tribes settled in the Beit Shean and Hula Valleys and in the Jordan Valley towns of Ubeidiya, Delhamiya and Kafer-Miser. In the Hula Valley, the Egyptian ez-Zubeids later sold their land to Jewish settlers from Yessud-Hama'ala. According to an 1893 British Palestine Exploration Fund report, Egyptians made up most of the population in Jaffa.<br /><br />Additionally, Avneri shows, Arab and Muslim immigrants also came from Algeria, Damascus, Yemen, Afghanistan, Persia, India, Tripoli, Morocco, Turkey and Iraq. The French conquest of Algeria, for example, led to the eventual rebellion and imprisonment of Abd el-Kadar el-Hassani, whose followers in 1856 fled to Syria and the Lower Galilee towns of Shara, Ulam, Ma'ader, Kafer-Sabet, Usha (near present-day Ramat-Yohanan), the Mount Atlas village of Qedesh and villages on Lake Hula and in the Upper Galilee, where they spoke Berber. In Ramle, immigrants spoke Qebili, a Mugrabi dialect. Circassian refugees from the Caucasus settled in Trans-Jordan and as far east as Caesarea.<br /><br />Arab immigration continued to rise through World War I, as Avneri documents, despite locusts, the Ottoman draft and more epidemics. Egyptian laborers, contractors and businessmen flooded the country. By 1922, the Moslem population had more than doubled to 566,311, including 62,500 Bedouins. The 1931 Mandatory government census counted 693,147 permanent Moslem residents, including 66,553 Bedouins. It also gave the natural increase of the population as 132,211 --- 57,125 less than the absolute increase. Only illegal Arab immigration explains this contradiction, Avneri shows.<br /><br />The next census in 1948, as Avneri recounts, followed unprecedented economic growth, during which illegal Arab immigration continued. From April 1934 to November 1935, for example, 20,000 Haurani Arabs came to Palestine. These and thousands of other Arab immigrants worked on farms, construction projects (building roads, railroads and the Haifa port), and government and municipal jobs. Syrians and Lebanese Arabs were free to come with nothing but border passes, and they came along with immigrants from Somalia, Trans-Jordan, Persia, India, Ethiopia and the Hejaz. Mandatory government rules required the supervision of immigration, but Palestine's borders remained porous to all but Jews. In all, Avneri shows that 35,000 to 40,000 illegal Arab immigrants came from 1931 to 1947 --- on top of up to 20,000 other Arab immigrants who arrived from 1935 to 1945.<br /><br />The book also carefully examines numerous historical descriptions of a desolate landscape, composed almost entirely of swamps and deserts, and sold to the Jewish people by absentee Arab landlords, appointed by the Ottoman government, at enormous profits. Dozens of sales are documented specifically, including some by the Egyptian el-Husseini family of Yasser Arafat.<br /><br />Altogether, this book shatters the Arab claim of dispossession.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

On the contrary, Arab combatants had booby trapped houses and fought among civilians. Although 52 Arabs killed were mostly combatants, however, incorrect news reports went uncorrected--mirroring the 1983 experience detailed exhaustively here.<br /><br />Raphael Israeli's examination of this 1983 incident shows how Middle East news often becomes distorted. On March 21, 1983, girls at Arrabeh school near Jenin were reportedly poisoned en masse. Before classes began at 8 a.m., a 17-year-old student ran to the window, coughed, complained of breathing difficulties, headache, nausea, drowsiness and stomach pains. Then 17 more girls became ill. On March 22, West Bank health services director Dr. Hussein Ubeid confirmed visiting the school and reported a sharp odor that irritated his nostrils and throat.<br /><br />On March 23, the author shows, a poison pollution team examined the school but found no trace of poison. Within four days, however, the school issued two more mass poisoning reports. The following week, 56 girls at Jenin's Zahra Middle School similarly took ill. In April, 310 Hebron girls were hospitalized with Jenin syndrome. Serious cases went to Israel's Ramban Hospital in Haifa. Patients were given oxygen, glucose infusions and tranquilizers--and improved.<br /><br />Reported here are findings of 15 scientists dispatched to the sites, who found zero evidence of food, water, gas or pesticide poisoning or pollution. But Israeli health director general Dr. Baruch Modan's assurances--that there were \\"neither poisoning nor a physical disease, nor any obscure scheme against those young women's health\\"--<br />fell on deaf ears.<br /><br />As the author shows, journalists attributed to military sources \\"news\\" of \\"poisonous substances\\"--supposedly \\"sprinkled on the curtains of the classrooms.\\" Furthermore, Islamic, Arab, Soviet block and Western European media reproduced, often verbatim, \\"accusations and statements regarding the mass poisoning,\\"--including unsubstantiated claims \\"that nerve gas was used in this affair.\\" The book shows how the extensive media reports of unusually high levels of protein in the girls' urine were in fact fabricated. The author demonstrates reporters' hateful suggestions that Israel used Nazi methods.<br /><br />Israelis realized at that juncture, the author notes, that Europe's cradle of anti-Semitism was again savoring an anti-Semitic bouillon, this time, one concocted in the Arab middle East.<br /><br />Actually, the reported poisoning was merely a case of mass hysteria, he shows. It precisely matched descriptions in a landmark 1947 medical report on physiological results of psychogenic hyperventilation. Of many similar cases worldwide, the author demonstrates, no others attracted much press coverage. But the media hype--which the author exposes as paralleling medieval European blood libels and Middle Eastern slanders targeting Jews--falsely provided the news with international traction.<br /><br />The author also exposes a shocking press role in which virtually every major media outlet participated. They reproduced mass-distributed lies, unedited, without skepticism--and without compunctions about the potentially deadly consequences.<br /><br />Months before, the book also notes, Israel invaded Lebanon to halt decades of cross-border rocket and terror attacks that took hundreds of civilian lives. The author demonstrates that here, too, the media engaged in a festival of anti-Israel bashing. Reports had routinely endowed fundamentalist murderers with progressive traits, he discovered, but meticulously smeared their Christian and Jewish opponents. The author found that reporters had even mis-translated and reported pleas in Arabic --- that Israel rid Lebanon of PLO terrorist jerks --- as pleas to stop killing us.<br /><br />The author compares the 1983 incident to other medical stories, frequently sensationalized to sell newspapers and ads. Even in instances reporters had deemed un-newsworthy, a professional study the author found demonstrated the reportorial tendency to manufacture news by attributing severe causes, more ominous than actual events.<br /><br />The author also shows Western media unwillingness to expose a genuine Middle Eastern sensation, intense hatred featured regularly in Arab government newspapers that target Jews and Israel with false claims that they poison Arabs, bake Passover matzo with Christian blood, kidnap Arab children to drink their blood --- and so on. The author believes that Western media failure to recognize or expose this phenomenon lets it seep into their news --- which remain uncorrected, even when proven wrong.<br /><br />The author exposes that the 1983 deception involved two kinds of lies, active lies --- deliberately falsified information --- that victimized the intended Israeli targets. And passive lies promulgated by Palestinian friends and political allies which furthered the false impressions and aided the Arab war on Israel.<br /><br />The author analyzes motivations that make lying common to spies, subversives, saboteurs and other swindlers: It constitutes an assumption of power, in which the ones deceived are reduced in stature, and symbolically nullified, while impostors temporarily grow more powerful.<br /><br />Israeli also condemns the masquerades of investigative journalists and the false and exaggerated claims of advertisers --- an important point, since global media are mainly ad-supported corporations. He concludes that political lies were calibrated for modern mass communications within the tension-filled Arab Israeli conflict, to aggrandize Palestinian victimhood, psychologically-induce mass hysteria --- and necessarily reverberate against mankind's oldest hatred.<br /><br />The author concludes that while it may be politically incorrect to instigate hatred for any ethnic or religious minority, this taboo does not transfer to nations, which enabled political cartoonists, writers and reporters to easily slide thinly disguised stereotypes past their editors--and mass disseminate virtual facsimiles from Der Sturmer.<br /><br />He also concludes that within the 55-year military and intellectual jihad against Israel, lazy, unwary newsmen, wittingly or unwittingly, often play a big role.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

941095:US	52709697	R1DTUUNX1293Y9	0929093135	739461994	Battleground: Fact & Fantasy in Palestine	Books	5	56	60	N	N	Excellent	Like the work of Arieh Avneri, Howard Sachar, Connor Cruise O'Brien, Efraim Karsh and Martin Kramer, Battleground is a magnificent piece of reporting on Middle East history, whose most salient facts revisionists have unfortunately papered over during the 29 years since it was first published.<br /><br />This book recounts the beginnings of a new 55-year Arab jihad war against the Jewish state. Katz elucidates critical parts of the historical puzzle, including this centerpiece: In 1919, less than two years after the Balfour Declaration, Emir Faisal of Syria and Iraq--who along with his father the Sharif Hussein of Mecca were then the only recognized Arab leaders in the world--declared the plan for a Jewish national homeland in all of Palestine as \\"moderate and proper.\\" (Of course, it was and remains merely an extension of the jihad [[ASIN:1591025540 initiated]] when the Jewish people rejected Mohammed's claim to be a prophet.)<br /><br />The book shows that by international vote of the League of Nations at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, the world community adopted a plan to establish a Jewish National Home in Palestine--which included all of current day Israel and Transjordan.<br /><br />One may here read that history, and the treaties between Chaim Weizmann and the Emir Faisal of Iraq, as well as letters supporting this plan by both he and his father, Sharif of Mecca.<br /><br />For the record, this book cites a great deal of primary source material from Arab leaders themselves. Much of it, furthermore, contradicts current-day Arab sentiments and claims. As one Arab League leader admitted, for example, \\"everyone knows, Palestine does not exist.\\"<br /><br />Katz also shows that although the Paris League of Nations meeting accorded all of Palestine to the Jewish people, Britain unilaterally and illegally granted more than 80% of original Palestine to the Arabs, creating current day Jordan.<br /><br />In short, Katz shows that the 1919 League of Nations vote to adopt the plan did not (as conventional wisdom now wrongly supposes) unilaterally impose a decision on the Arab peoples of the Middle East without their input. In fact, the League of Nations acted as direct result of a 1919 Arab treaty with Jewish leaders.<br /><br />King Faisal's approval of plans for a National Home for the Jews was significant not least for its policy--and inclusion of current day Israel and all of current day Jordan. In 1919, the Emir Faisal wrote--and numerous scholarly, studies and population figures substantiate this point--there were few Arabs and many Jews in Palestine, and King Faisal saw the importance of recognizing the rights of the Jewish people to their homeland.<br /><br />The book also shows that the Jewish people did not--as another common misconception holds--\\"steal\\" the land of Israel. On the contrary, beginning in the 1870s and 1880s, the Jewish Agency and many private groups and people purchased land (usually swamps and desert) from private absentee Arab landowners, often at wildly inflated prices.<br /><br />Katz also carefully establishes the actual number of Arab refugees from the 1948 war against a nascent Israel that 7 Arab nations began in 1948. The correct number is 480,000, a number that Katz shows Arab leaders at the United Nations admitted at the time. Gradually, over the years, he also demonstrates, that number has been falsely inflated--a fact that even the United Nations admits. The \\"refugees\\" now include hundreds of thousands originally from other states, and their heirs.<br /><br />Neither does Katz omit the nearly 1 million Jewish refugees booted from 22 Arab and Muslim lands between 1920 and 1978 with nothing but the shirts on their backs. (The dark motivations for mass ethnic cleansing of Jews from the Arab Middle East are exposed by Malka Hillel Shulewitz and Itamar Levin and Rachel Neiman in two books, The Forgotten Millions and Locked Doors.) Including the children and grandchildren of those Jewish refugees fromArab lands would raise their number today to more than 4 million, who together now account for more than half Israel's population.<br /><br />And finally, Katz shows the central problem that has plagued Israeli-Arab relations since long before Israel was founded in 1948. Most Arab nations--from which the majority of people now known as Palestinian actually immigrated--have never recognized even the considerably reduced version of the Jewish state. Rather, they continue a permanent state of jihad war against non-Muslim infidels, rather than admit the Jewish people a right to self-determination, or a state governing the land in which Jewish inhabitants have remained since before the Romans sacked the second Temple in 70 A.D.<br /><br />This book corrects reams of false propaganda that obscures the past and the Jewish right to a state in Israel.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Twelve volumes of children's books followed, from which these 36 tales are gleaned. Young readers should remain eternally grateful.<br /><br />This collection opens in Chelm, the village of idiots young and old. Even the people have funny names--Gronam Ox, Dopey Lekisch, Zeinvel Ninny, Shmendrick Numskull and Feyvel Thickwit. The way they speak and act is still funnier.<br /><br />Gronam, for example, would have been a happy man, but for the elders who regularly visited--to whom he regularly spoke nonsense. His first wife Genendel would reproach him, to which he replied, \\"In the future, whenever you hear me saying something silly, come into the room and let me know. I will immediately change the subject.\\"<br /><br />She refused. \\"If they learn you're a fool, you'll lose your job as head of the council.\\" Instead, each time he said anything silly, she offered to hand him the key to their strongbox. \\"Then you'll know you've been talking like a fool.\\"<br /><br />That year, the town met with a scarcity of sour cream, which was sorely needed for the coming Pentecost, a holiday on which the townsfolk normally ate a lot of it. Gronam had the solution. He proposed making \\"a law that water is to be called sour cream, and sour cream is to be called water.\\" Given the wells full of water, he noted, all the women would have barrels full of sour cream as a result.<br /><br />Sender Donkey, Treitel Fool and their most foolish compatriots all heartily approved. So the new law was written. But Genendel shortly appeared with the strongbox key. When Gronam explained their arrangement, the elders grew enraged. How dare a woman suggest she knew better when wisdom or silliness had been spoken.<br /><br />They in turn changed another law: When Genendel believed Gronam's pronouncements silly, she should give the elders the strongbox key and let them decide. If they disagreed, she would double their portions of blintzes, cakes and tea. From that day forward, Gronam spoke freely, and Genendel hardly said a word: She was not about to serve blintzes generously.<br /><br />Then there is Shlemiel, also of the fabled Chelm, and as fine a businessman as the town could offer. He married Mrs. Shlemiel, whose father gave him a dowry, with which he bought a goat in Lublin. But en route home, he left the goat tethered to a tree while he went into an inn for some brandy, chopped liver and onions and a plate of chicken soup and noodles. The innkeeper (not surprisingly) switched his old blind billy goat for Shlemiel's milking goat. Lots more fun and some Chelmnick wisdom followed.<br /><br />Readers also encounter \\"Shrewd Todie and Lyzer the Miser.\\" The former had a wife Shaindel and seven children and never earned enough to feed them. He had such poor luck working at trades that he decided if he should make candles, the sun would never set. During an especially cold winter, Shaindel told Todie that if he could not get something to eat, she would go to the Rabbi and get a divorce. \\"And what will you do with it,\\" he asked her. \\"Eat it?\\"<br /><br />Lyzer meanwhile was so stingy, he'd let his wife bake bread but once every four weeks: Stale bread was eaten more slowly than fresh. He left his poor goats to feast on his neighbors' thatched roofs, rather than feed them. He preferred to eat his dry bread and borscht on a box so that his upholstered chairs would not wear out. And he never made a loan, preferring to keep his money in his strongbox.<br /><br />One day, Todie asked Lyzer to borrow a silver spoon, promising he would return it the next. Not one to doubt holy words, Lyzer loaned the spoon and was pleased the next day when Todie returned it, plus a silver teaspoon, explaining that the spoon had given birth. Todie was honest, and had to return both. He repeated the exercise twice more.<br /><br />At last, Todie came to Lyzer to borrow silver Shabbat candlesticks, which Lyzer gladly loaned.

In sections respectively labeled &#34;occupation&#34; and &#34;depopulation, he lists and describes 418 villages, implying that in 1948, Israel forced Arabs from their homes and villages at gunpoint. At that time, however, thousands of ruins, abandoned during the Ottoman era, remained dotting Israel's countryside, according to Moshe Brawer's 1994 Israel Affairs review of the work.<br /><br />Four years before Israel's War of Independence, as Brawer notes, a detailed study based on British Survey of Palestine maps listed 2,077 abandoned rural villages, hamlets and smaller sites--against only 1,274 inhabited Arab, Jewish and other villages and hamlets, some of them temporary.<br /><br />Furthermore, Dr. Robinson's 1841 book, Journal of Travels in the Year 1838 and H.B. Tristram's [[ASIN:B009YM4768 The Land of Israel]] 633-page Land of Israel (1865), detail earthquakes, droughts, conscriptions, onerous taxes, internal wars, thievery, malaria, cholera and other epidemics that depopulated much of Israel long before 1880, when the first wave of Jewish immigration began. Brawer finds it disturbing that a work touted as a great academic achievement includes none of these facts.<br /><br />Khalidi also omits the commonality of Ottoman depopulation programs. In Chio (Greece), Damascus, Hasbeiya and Aleppo, non-Muslims were slaughtered in 1822, 1858, 1859 and 1860. In southern Syria (as it was then called), the Turks conscripted all available youths and extorted &#34;annual tax of several piastres for every fruit-tree from the very year it is planted,&#34; according to Tristram, even for olive trees that took 40 years to produce fruit. He and Robinson found Israel barren and empty, its villages poor--and frequently abandoned. In Tiberias, &#34;almost exclusively a Jewish town,&#34; the Muslim quarter was in 1865 &#34;almost wholly in ruins, having been overthrown in the great earthquake of 1837.&#34;<br /><br />A true academic masterpiece would have discussed prior devastation and justified conclusions in spite of it, Brawer notes. Khalidi fails this test, neglecting to remark (as well) that Schwobel in 1904 found, against 329 inhabited rural Galilee areas, some 460 ruined villages and hamlets. Finally, Khalidi misses another study, which determined that Ottoman rule brought devastation and abandonment to at least 50% of Hebron area villages and hamlets, 26-27% near Tulkarem and Nablus and 85% in Lower eastern Galilee and the central Jordan Valley.<br /><br />The missing long-term perspective is bad enough, but Brawer finds equal disappointment in Khalidi's avoidance of the benefits that Arab labor derived from three decades of British administration (1918-48) and Jewish immigration, which together brought law, order, vital services, economic investment and modernization to the land.<br /><br />From 1922 to 1947, Jewish agricultural settlements increased coastal plain citrus groves 971%, to 75,000 acres. Khalidi does not reference that, or the masses of workers these groves attracted from Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Arabia---cited by Arthur Ruppin, Bill Farrell, Justin McCarthy, Yehoshua Porath, Alexander Schlolch, Neville Mandel, Vital Cuinet and official Ottoman data, according to Brawer. This is a significant omission since workers lived in temporary shacks on land they didn't own, and in 1948 abandoned them precisely because they were not permanent.<br /><br />Then comes the failure to improve on Arif al-Arif's 1950s historical-political study and personal archives, Brawer observes. Khalidi follows his long, virulently anti-Israel introduction by 418 sadly inaccurate surveys with rough sketch-maps and photographs as backup. He lists each area's geographical attributes, history, distance from district capital, average elevation, land ownership, use, population and dwellings in 1931 and 1944, Brawer notes, the blurred photographs could have been taken almost anywhere, including current-day West Bank villages.<br /><br />He also finds blatant inaccuracies. Khalidi calls Fardisiya and Khirbat al-Buri villages. In 1945, Fardisiya (2.5 kilometers south of Tulkarem) had 20 inhabitants who owned less than 20 acres and four small buildings. Not exactly a village. Furthermore, it was not conquered, but was ceded to Israel under the 1949 armistice, Brawer notes. Khalidi lists no population for Khirbat al-Burj, 34 kilometers south of Haifa, according to Brawer, but states that residents owned less than 4 acres. Air photos show two stone buildings and some hovels. Also not really a village.<br /><br />In 1948, there were early 1940s British Royal Air Force photos showing sizes and numbers of houses, cultivated lands and villages. Israel supplemented these that year with high quality air photos of most rural areas involved in the war. The British Survey of Palestine included many detailed maps of villages later devastated.<br /><br />Until 1947, village headmen often kept population, economic and special event data in village notebooks. Israeli academics have also contributed substantial scholarship. But Brawer calls Khalidi on his failure to consult any available data, including material declassified in the 1980s. He simply labeled these items &#34;not available.&#34;<br /><br />Worse, Khalidi employs the flawed Mandate government Village Statistics 1945--which reflects exaggerations by which headmen enhanced government food rations. He also relies on a Beirut reproduction, whose editor further embellished the initial over-counts. The original categorized land ownership as &#34;Arab, Jewish or others.&#34; Beirut editor Sami Hadawi disingenuously shifted all non-Jewish land--including churches, monasteries, institutions and organizations--to Arabs. Khalidi unreservedly repeats this deception, Brawer reports.<br /><br />And finally, Khalidi omits or grossly misrepresents war-related factors that contributed to 1948 depopulation. He often reproduces portions of Israeli reports--out of context--solely to lay blame on Israel. The major war contributions of Arab villagers or the locations of villages relative to their grueling, months-long assault on Israel's roads, he omits, Brawer observes.<br /><br />Had evidence been that overwhelming, Khalidi ought to have been able to obtain first-hand material from villagers who lived through these events, Brawer notes.<br /><br />Overall, a major disappointment.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

967832:US	52709697	RWLQ3KIOCWYLO	156584789X	84979174	The Other Israel: Voices of Refusal and Dissent	Books	1	7	12	N	N	Hermetically sealed	This slight 200-page book is one of the best proofs I have seen to date that journalists consider all Israeli actions both falsely, and in a vacuum.<br /><br />The book ostensibly concerns the Jewish presence in disputed areas. Yet the authors speciously claim Israel never offered Arab sovereignty there. Actually, Israel (and before that, Zionist leaders) offered to recognize a sovereign 23rd Arab state at least 6 times through history--in 1937, 1948, 1967, 1977, 2000 and 2001, the last two under Arab fire. Each time, they were rejected.<br /><br />Segev, Anthony Lewis, Jeff Halper, Amira Hass and other essayists make highly selective use of facts, incessantly invoke PA terminology and support Palestinian Authority &#34;resistance,&#34; -- the PA euphemism that includes blowing women and children into tiny bits of flesh in cafes, pizza parlors and supermarkets. They don't acknowledge Israel's internationally established and recognized right to statehood. They don't acknowledge the most basic human right--to live free from fear or terrorism. They don't acknowledge the Arab wars and terrorism that have ceaselessly attempted to extinguish Israel's Jewish presence from the state's first moment.<br /><br />Segev's forward discusses &#34;the catastrophe that befell the 700,000 Arabs who emigrated, fled or were banished from their homes.&#34; He complains of Jewish &#34;deception,&#34; while neglecting clear PA intentions to annihilate Israel, as stated in at least 36 clauses of the Palestine National Charter, which the PA has never revised or revoked (contrary to Segev's false contention). Segev is equally oblivious to the bellicose, Islamist PA Constitution and relentless official daily PA articles, sermons, editorials, cartoons, music videos and school lessons that intentionally cultivate hatred for Jews and Israel, to induce mass murder. Any Ha'aretz reporter should know, these genocidal documents and incitements violate the 1951 UN Genocide Convention, Oslo accords I and II, Hebron Protocol of January 15, 1997, 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights --- and give Israel unconditional rights of self-defense. But Segev doesn't.<br /><br />Segev also ignores the rights of over 1 million Jews driven from their homes in Arab lands in coordinated, preplanned government attacks throughout the Middle East from 1920 through 1979, often at the cost of their lives. This oversight is critical, since Segev and company invoke U.N. resolution 194 as if it covered only Arab refugees.<br /><br />But resolution 194 refers to &#34;refugees,&#34; not &#34;Arab refugees&#34; --- indeed, it never mentions &#34;Arab&#34; or &#34;Palestinian&#34; at all --- and thus applies equally to [[ASIN:B002D19EEC Mizrahi Jews]], and millions of their descendants, who currently comprise roughly [[ASIN:B000FP2PDU half Israel's Jewish population]]. Jewish victims of Muslim religious apartheid spent 55 years building new lives in a Jewish state. This does not diminish their equal right to recompense for houses, business, livelihoods and assets illegally seized from them.<br /><br />By ignoring Mizrahis, Segev and company falsely suggest that Israel was created by European Jewry, and conclude its sovereignty is therefore illegitimate. But Israel is as much a state of Middle Eastern Jews as others--and no more beholden to artificial moral constructs than any other democratic nation with democratically promulgated statutes.<br /><br />The book unquestioningly accepts the supremacy of Arab claims over all other rights and claims. It examines Israel under a false moral magnifier, focusing exclusively on results, not the conflict's causes. Accuracy, however, would require acknowledgment of Arab league and states' monolithic rejection of resolution 194, which merely suggested a &#34;right of return&#34; --- only to those willing to &#34;live at peace with their neighbors&#34; --- and resettlement and compensation for the rest. Israel cannot legitimately be faulted for Arab refusals of normalcy, nor collective Arab refusals to resettle Arab refugees as Israel did Middle Eastern Jews.<br /><br />Concerning terror attacks since 2000 &#34;against densely populated Israeli targets,&#34; the essayists neglect PA establishment since 1993 of a popular suicide culture. They barely notice illegal PA arms buildup, repression or corruption, much less the spike in Arab terrorism after 1993, that violated Oslo I and II provisions to unconditionally halt all violence and incitement. Forget that until 2000, Israel handed over land and governmental responsibilities, despite increases in terrorism and Jewish civilian casualties. Forget, lest readers believe Palestinians bear responsibility for their misery, or that Arab villages were &#34;locked down&#34; only after a decade of PA refusal to combat anti-Israel violence. No, Segev accuses Israelis of reverting to &#34;a tribal, isolated, emotional, and nationalistic mood.&#34;<br /><br />New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis carries this untenable position further, unquestioningly accepting PA dogma that Jewish &#34;settlements&#34; are the sole source of disagreement, although they consume less than 4% of the territory disputed. This specious argument forgets 1948 to 1967, and hundreds of Israeli civilians murdered in 3,500-plus cross-border Palestinian and Syrian Arab terror attacks--launched from the Jordan River's &#34;West Bank,&#34; Egyptian controlled Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. Israel then had no Jewish &#34;settlements.&#34; It forgets thousands of Jordanian shells rained on Jerusalem in Tel Aviv in 1967, and former PA &#34;Prime Minister&#34; Abu Mazen's May 1974 order to murder 21 Ma'alot children and gravely injure 68 others (Jerusalem Post, Nov. 1, 1999).<br /><br />And worst of all, it projects the most devastating form of anti-Arab racism: the Jewish people provide equal rights to Arab citizens of Israel, and are expected to do as a matter of course. Arab people in the disputed areas, on the other hand, may without repercussion abuse basic human rights --- and deny any rights at all to Jewish people living among them. Lewis evidently thinks Arabs so base that they are incapable of  universally applying the same fundamental human rights at least nominally expected from every other people.<br /><br />Jeff Halper disparages Israel's by-pass roads, forgetting they were built only to avail residents of terror-free highways, not to destroy a potential Arab state. To these writers, the illegal 1948 Jordanian and Egyptian occupations of now-disputed lands bear no mention. The result is a hermetically sealed vacuum, in which Arabs bear no responsibility.<br /><br />This essentially racist viewpoint falsely absolves Arab leaders and states of all sins, including Arab ethnic cleansing of Jews from disputed areas in 1922, '29, '39 and '48, and 1948 removal of 100,000 Jews from East Jerusalem, two thirds of its population, to suddenly render a predominantly Jewish city &#34;traditionally Arab.&#34; It also absolves Arab thefts of large disputed tracts that Jews had bought or rightfully owned under the 1858 [[ASIN:0878559647 Ottoman Land Law]].<br /><br />These Israeli essayists are &#34;patriots&#34; only by a myopic definition that whitewashes Arab wars and terrorism and blames Israel alone.

Villages were abandoned to avoid onerous taxes, conscriptions and internal wars--ruins of which \\"remained well into the twentieth century.\\"<br /><br />H.B. Tristram's 633-page Land of Israel is one such account. I am fortunate to own a copy of the fourth, 1882 edition.<br /><br />During 10 months, Tristram traveled the length and breadth of Israel with a \\"small party of friends, in 1863-4,\\" whose object was to \\"convey the observations and impressions of each day as to the scenery, features and products of the country through which we were passing....,\\" including drawings of his friends M.C.P. Medlycott and P. Egerton-Warburton and photographs of H.T. Bowman. The most significant thing about Tristram's log is its age; he wrote it in 1865, well before what Israelis call the first Aliya, when longtime Jewish residents were joined by others from Eastern Europe and elsewhere in the Middle East.<br /><br />Tristram's findings largely tracked those found earlier and later. Dr. Robinson's 1841 Journal of Travels in the Year 1838 had recorded numerous disasters that left many Holy Land villages deserted and in ruins. Brawer similarly reports, a 1944 study based on detailed, then-recent Survey of Palestine maps and similar competent sources, listed 2,077 abandoned rural villages, hamlets and smaller sites and only 1,051 inhabited Arab and Jewish villages and 223 hamlets, some strictly temporary.<br /><br />Accompanying Tristram's party was Constantino, \\"a Greek by birth\\" and native of Chio, who had earlier traveled Israel with M. de Saulcy. He recalled the Muslim massacre of Greek infidels in April 1822, and the deportation of Chio's masses as slaves. Constantino had \\"escaped only to be sold as a slave boy into Egypt\\" (p.4).<br /><br />Evidently, massacres of Christians were fairly common, as Tristram reports such atrocities in Damascus and Hasbeiya in 1860, whose news had brought representatives of the Western Powers to \\"Beyrout.\\" British Consul James Finn in his 1858 and 1860 reports to the Earl of Malmesbury also reported routine oppression and massacres of non-Muslims, as did Consul James H. Skene from Aleppo in 1859 and many others. Indeed, the author himself was attacked by stone-throwing Muslim boys, \\"who pelted me for a Christian dog.\\" (p. 399)<br /><br />Taxes were equally oppressive. Tristram describes an Ottoman \\"system of finance which ruthlessly extorts an annual tax of several piastres for every fruit-tree from the very year it is planted, even when, as in the case of the olive, it is forty years before it arrives at perfection.\\"<br /><br />Given the hardships and oppressive Turkish rule, it is not surprising that Tristram found the land largely barren and empty and its villages poor -- often, abandoned. In Jaffa, he found increasing development, the product of non-Muslim immigrants. A \\"Russian hospice is drawing a suburb along the Jaffa Road.\\"<br /><br />Outside Jerusalem, Tristram likewise found more agriculture, in an area that six years earlier, he wrote, was barren and filled with rubbish heaps. Here, too, the development grew not from Muslim or Arab labor, but the efforts of Russians, Greeks and Jews. On the Bethlehem Road, Sir Moses Montifiore \\"has built a neat range of small houses for poor Jews, and both Greeks and Jews have been enclosing and cultivating largely on the slopes.\\" Gardens that had previously been limited to cabbage patches on Mount Zion, now straggled down to the Hinnon Valley and beyond. Vines and olives were being planted.<br /><br />\\"The curse is upon the land,\\" Tristram observed, \\"but it is the curse of poverty; not on its soil, but on its indolent, degraded, and oppressed inhabitants.\\" The Ottoman system of corvee regularly pillaged animals and plantings. The hill fortress of Sanur north of Jeba, for example, had been destroyed following Robinson's 1838 visit. And nearby, Tristram found the large \\"meadow of sinking,\\" the undrained Merj el Ghuruk swamp into which the hills emptied their spring rains.<br /><br />In Tiberias, similarly, the \\"Mohammedan quarter, is almost wholly in ruins, having been overthrown in the great earthquake of 1837.\\" In fact, Tiberias was \\"almost exclusively a Jewish town,\\" where residents opened their doors to welcome the Sabbath.<br /><br />This book is one of the sources cited by the wrongly maligned Joan Peters. It was also cited by Arieh Avneri in Claim of Dispossession. Tristram puts the lie to current-day myths surrounding 19th century \\"Palestine.\\" Then known more commonly as Syria, the 19th Century Holy Land was little more than a ruined, oppressed wasteland, its roads ruled by brigands, where new immigrants were awakening agriculture and development and were eager to make the desert bloom.<br /><br />This impression was confirmed in 1904 by Schwobel, who found 329 inhabited rural Galilee areas--and at least 460 ruined villages and hamlets. Ottoman rule, another study found, brought devastation and abandonment to at least 50% of Hebron area villages and hamlets, 26-27% near Tulkarem-Nablus and 85% in Lower eastern Galilee and the central Jordan Valley.<br /><br />As Brawer shows--and we learn here, first hand--from a long-term perspective Israel's 1948 War of Independence constituted but one \\"destructive episode\\" in rural Palestine, albeit extensive.<br /><br />For a report unvarnished by modern day revisionists, look no further.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Lately, an increasing number engage interchangeably in anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. In this 1995 paperback, Scottish Christian R. D. Kernohan takes a reasonable and eminently righteous approach. He dedicates the book, among others to those renewing their encounter with the Holy Land, \\"which today includes the State of Israel, either by visiting it or thinking about it.\\"<br /><br />He draws attention to Israel's neglected place in Christian civilization and ideas, critical to Israel's place among nations but things that historical revisionists generally gloss over or forget. By ceding history to revisionists, Kernohan evidently recognizes that Western civilization undermines its righteous Judeo-Christian foundations, of which Judaism is the original pillar. He marks events in Jerusalem and Israel central to Christianity, conjuring Calvary, Gethsemane and the Mount of Olives, associated with Christ's Ascension and His teachings. He notes Jericho and the Good Samaritan, and the imprecise locale of Emmaus, nevertheless somewhere seven miles from Jerusalem.<br /><br />Kernohan rightly recognizes the Israel's continuous Jewish presence, \\"if often ignored and despised,\\" from the failed revolt against Rome to organized settlement's start \\"in the last phase of the Turkish Empire.\\" He sees that \\"all Jews had a special relationship with the Land, and especially with Jerusalem. They did not forget the city of the Temple; and they longed for `next year in Jerusalem'.\\"<br /><br />He details important 19th century and earlier Christian travelers to Israel, focusing mostly on those since Scots missionaries Bonar and McCheyne who in 1839 correctly noted Israel as \\"the center of the Jewish world'.\\" The Crusades, conflict with the Ottomans and neighboring Christian powers, the split of Western and Eastern churches and the Reformation and Counter-Reformation, Kernohan notes, never severed European and British Christian ties to Israel from early history until now.<br /><br />Pelagius gave his name to the Christian heresy of abandoning original sin, but circa 415 C.E. defended his ideas in Jerusalem. His contemporary, Saint Ninian, imported Christianity to Scotland. Israel's Christian travelers included Byzantine Emperor Constantine's mother Helena, Adamnan (9th Abbot of Iona and biographer of Saint Columba), and Arculf the Bishop of Gaul, circa 700 C.E. In about 800 an unknown British nun wrote her kinsman Willibald's account of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem as \\"the square house cut in rock,\\" his drink from a wine-vessel in the Galilee and of the Jewish synagogue in Tiberias.<br /><br />Saewulf wrote during the first Crusades, which Kernohan defines not only as \\"confrontation of Christian and Muslim Arab (or Saracen) in Palestine,\\" but a wide-ranging \\"conflict of cultures and civilizations\\" extending throughout the Middle East, Mediterranean, and as \\"far west as Spain and Portugal.\\" Many Eastern Christians, he notes, fit into neither of these camps.<br /><br />Historical myths concerning the Crusaders, moreover, are \\"more significant today on the Arab side,\\" which presents their eventual defeat in Twentieth century, \\"anti-imperialist\\" terms, and consider Israel an \\"intrusion\\" in the Modern Middle East that must be destroyed as were Crusader States nearly a millennium earlier.<br /><br />Moreover, Islam was neither a monolithic, benevolent ruler, nor predominantly Arab as reporters ordinarily now suppose. Israel's foreign Muslim conquerors in 637 were both Muslim and Arab. Jerusalem was subsequently ruled by \\"varied ruling castes or imperialisms,\\" however, and predominantly by Turks.<br /><br />The author errs somewhat in referring to early Muslim caliphs as \\"tolerant,\\" which they most certainly were not. Still, Jerusalem was subsequently subjected to far harsher rule. The 11th century saw demolition squads sent \\"to smash up the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\\"<br /><br />As Moshe Gil notes in[[ASIN:0521599849 A History of Palestine, 634-1099]], they also imposed Islamic laws on second-class, non-Muslim dhimmis (Christians and Jews), forcing them to pay the Jizyha tax and subjecting them to many institutional Islamic humiliations.<br /><br />\\"Inefficiency, cruelty, extortion and tyranny\\" prevailed throughout Palestine's last centuries of Muslim rule, Kernohan notes. Palestinian Authority-appointed clerics envision reinstating Islamic dhimmi laws, as outlined in the PA's Constitution.<br /><br />Ironically, despite Arab nationalism's continuing protests \\"about Jewish settlement in Palestine,\\" it actually \\"took shape much later than political Zionism.\\" Actually, although the West associates it with Islam, Arab nationalism was also \\"disproportionately influenced by the Christian Arab minority.\\"<br /><br />Kernohan does not automatically equate anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, yet notes their frequent overlap, both in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere. He also recognizes that Jesus was a Jew, and that the Old Testament remains central to Christianity. Israel, he writes, is not \\"just a strange and wonderful people.\\" It is also \\"a mystery from which emerge God's purposes \\"for all peoples.\\"<br /><br />He finds \\"something wonderful in the restoration of the State of Israel in the Holy Land, despite all the conflict,\\" and its continuing cruelty. By all human standards, he measures Israel's resurrection, continued survival and its contributions to mankind \\"an astonishing achievement based on a series of extreme improbabilities.\\" There may be doubts on how 55 years of Israeli history relate to the prophetic visions of Ezekiel, Amos, Isaiah, or Zechariah. But Israel replaced the long Ottoman era's barren wastes, swamps and desolation with thriving towns, agriculture and cities.<br /><br />\\"Jewish attachment to the land of Israel must be taken into account in Christian-Jewish relations,\\" Kernohan concludes. He rejects any argument \\"urged as if the Holocaust had never happened.\\" Whatever God's plans for the Jewish people, Kernohan believes, Christian-Jewish relations must rest on \\"acceptance of the state of Israel in the Land of Israel\\" and recognition of ties binding Israel to \\"even those Jews who have no thought of emigrating\\" or relinquishing their respective British or American citizenship.

The worst thing about it: far too few college or university trustees have apparently ever read it. Otherwise, fewer institutions of higher education would be apt to grant the Massachusetts Institute of Technology linguist's demand that his speaking engagements include an equal number of talks on political history--in which he's untrained.<br /><br />Cohn's book shines necessary light on Chomsky's dealings and outright miscreance. He has a real and continuing affinity for purveyors of neo-Nazi hatred. As Cohn reports here, Chomsky's Fateful Triangle was first issued in 1983 by Noontide Press, the publishing and bookselling arm of the California neo-Nazi, Holocaust denying Institute for Historical Review.<br /><br />Noontide's catalogue of anti-Semitic offerings, Cohn reports, includes Holocaust deniers, Nazi-era propaganda films banned for sale in Germany, hate literature by Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, and the late Father Coughlin, the notorious Protocols of the Elders of Zion and other books by Chomsky, whom Noontide crows, &#34;enlightens as no other writer on Israel, Zionism, and American complicity.&#34; According to Cohn, Chomksy refuses to disassociate himself from this group.<br /><br />As Cohn also notes, Chomsky often writes for such anti-Semitic outlets as Z Magazine, Lies of Our Times, Maine's Common Courage Press, Canada's Black Rose Books, California's Journal of Historical Review (which Canadian Customs bans as hate literature) and California's Marxist Pacifica network, which often broadcasts Chomsky's incendiary speeches.<br /><br />What's worse, Chomsky defends anti-Semites and Holocaust revisionists. Cohn discovered two &#34;remarkably revealing&#34; documents exposing Chomsky's link with La Veille Taupe (The Old Mole), the French publisher of Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson. In one, VT chief Pierre Guillaume recounts his 1979 introduction to Chomsky. Within months, without further contact between them, Chomsky signed and promoted Guillaume's petition in support of Faurisson's &#34;findings,&#34; describing Faurisson as a &#34;respected&#34; professor conducting &#34;extensive historical research into the Holocaust question.&#34;<br /><br />In the second, &#34;Quelques commentaires &eacute;l&eacute;mentaires sur le droit &agrave; la libert&eacute; d'expression,&#34; (Some elementary comments concerning the right of free expression), Chomsky supported the right of free speech for fascists and anti-Semites-and speciously claimed that Faurisson is neither. Chomsky's 1980 preface to VT's Memoire en D&eacute;fense says Faurisson could best be described as &#34;a sort of apolitical liberal,&#34; a defense Chomksy reaffirmed in a December 12, 1980 conversation with a Guillaume associate. As Cohn shows, it's nearly &#34;impossible to come across a French `revisionist' publication&#34;-- by Guillaume, Faurisson or Serge Thion--&#34;that omits the obligatory reference to Chomsky's patronage.&#34;<br /><br />Putting aside Fateful Triangle's prominent place in distasteful catalogues, Cohn also examines its treatment of the pivotal 1929 Arab riots and Israeli War of Independence. To the former, Cohn notes, &#34;Chomsky devotes two paragraphs.&#34; His main text admits that in August 1929, 133 Jews were massacred, including a &#34;most ghastly incident&#34; in Hebron, where 60 Jews were killed. He quotes Christopher Sykes' [[ASIN:B002FK6RXW Cross Roads To Israel]] on this point. To the latter, Chomsky devotes only parts of two pages, taking events entirely out-of-context.<br /><br />Sykes leaves no doubt that in 1929 Haj Amin el-Husseini was a major instigator of Arab anti-Jewish violence in Israel. But as Cohn notes, though Chomksy cites Sykes, he doesn't so much as mention the Mufti. A Jewish boy was murdered after innocently kicking a ball into a neighboring Arab garden. El-Husseini's henchmen walked about Jerusalem carrying clubs. Unconcerned with &#34;sacred frontiers of the fatherland,&#34; the Mufti was &#34;interested in religion.... The enemy was the Jewish people.&#34; (Sykes, 1967 Nel Mentor ed., 11. 117-8 & 134).<br /><br />Nor does Chomsky mention &#34;the goading policy of the Supreme Moslem Council&#34; or its purposeful &#34;driving Jews to exasperation,&#34; as Cohn notes. No, Chomsky relies largely on an eyewitness (contradicted by many others, whom he ignores), to falsely blame the 1929 riots entirely on the Jews. He purposefully misconstrues a quotation as well.<br /><br />But Chomsky's most egregious sin, as Cohn notes, is in likening Jewish, Israeli and Zionist actions to Hitler's in all 12 of Triangle's references to history's worst tyrant.<br /><br />Any reader considering Noam Chomsky a light to all humanity owes himself an immediate audience with Cohn's elucidations.<br /><br />Cohn's book has only one fault, clearly not of his making: too bad this monograph doesn't sell at least as well as all of Chomsky's anti-American, anti-Semitic, anti-Israel &#34;books&#34;--put together.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

(An appropriate question for Passover, or Pessach.)<br /><br />It opens with an order of the Seder meal, illustrated with colorful and somehow very realistic clay figures showing each part of the service.<br /><br />From beginning to end, each page also includes large vibrant illustrations--photographs of clay figurines, actually--that bring the Passover story alive for children and adults alike. The book opens with Passover table set with clay candles, wine, Haggadah, matzoh and a clay Seder plate containing all the symbols to be used in the retelling of the Jewish people's escape from slavery in Egypt thousands of years ago. (These are of course a roasted lamb bone, hard boiled egg, maror or bitter vegetable, chopped fruit, and greens to dip in the salt water that symbolizes tears.)<br /><br />Blessings for all the major portions of the service are included in Hebrew and English.<br /><br />The Four Questions--undoubtedly the highlight of the Passover Seder for all children who must ask them--are likewise included in Hebrew and English, beginning with \\"How different this night is from every other night of the year. Every other night we eat bread or matzah. Why do we eat only matzah tonight?\\"<br /><br />A clay figure of a bow-tied young boy wearing a kipah appears at the Seder table to encourage children to proceed with their questions, which for shy ones can be very daunting indeed.<br /><br />The best part of the Haggadah, though, comes in the retelling of the Passover story, complete with clay illustrations of ancient Jewish people forced to build the Egyptian Pharaoh's pyramids and the ten plagues that God sent to Egypt when Pharaoh refused to grant Moses plea.<br /><br />Children love the illustrations of traditional Passover songs like Had Gadya, as well as those of sages of old, Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah, Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Tarfon discussing the Passover story until the wee hours of the night. Kids even like the clay figures of idols that the Jewish people were instructed not to worship.<br /><br />The Haggadah service closes with the ancient prayer of Jews whose ancestors were forced to leave their beloved Jerusalem by waves of conquerors through the ages, \\"Next year in Jerusalem,\\" and a two-page color spread of the spiritual capital established by King David in Biblical times.<br /><br />But the story and the playfulness don't end there.

Thanks to that brilliant staging, easily one of the 20th century's most remarkable dramatic productions, audiences of tens of thousands learned of this obscure artist and writer.<br /><br />Born on July 12, 1892, the third and youngest child of a merchant, Schulz lived and worked in Drohobycz, and reflected in all his works his close connection to his family and place. In 1939, the Soviets occupied eastern Poland, and Schulz survived that period without experiencing the deportation suffered by hundreds of thousands of others.<br /><br />Still, he was unable to work. But in June 1941, when the Nazis entered the area, he was like all the Jews of Poland further enslaved. The infamous Viennese Nazi and Jew murderer Felix Landau also had a taste for art, and boasted of keeping a Jewish artist slave alive on one daily bowl of soup and slice of bread. Schulz survived a year under Landau's \\"protection,\\" but on Black Thursday, Nov. 19, 1942, he was shot in the head by Gestapo officer Karl Guenther and buried at night by a devoted friend in a Jewish cemetery that has since disappeared, along with his grave.<br /><br />Assembled here, with Ficowski's 28-page introduction and his 12-page essay entitled \\"Catepillar Cat, or Bruno Schulz's Drive into the Future of the Past,\\" are more than 200 Schulz drawings and engravings, most of which reside in Warsaw's Museum of Literature. These include Schulz's [[ASIN:B000ER60QC The Booke of Idolatry]], an early collection of 25 works, including drawings, circa 1919 and later, on which he worked for several years. It illustrates imaginary scenes of mythical pastorals, nymphs and weird men, fawning on women. There are scenes labeled \\"Masochistic,\\" which are really more fetishist than the sort of full-blown evil one might expect, a series of nudes, and a 12-print section entitled \\"The Table,\\" reminiscent of scenes from [[ASIN:0140186255 The Street of Crocodiles]].<br /><br />In \\"Jews,\\" readers are treated to 16 prints and sketches of Jewish worshipers, students and scholars. The collection also includes 16 self-portraits and 8 portraits, all of them remarkable in their intensity and precision. There are also several book covers. But my favorite section is the 44-page group of \\"Illustrations\\" from Schulz's writings, including The Street of Crocodiles and [[ASIN:0395860237 Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass]].<br /><br />There is one other collection, [[ASIN:0880641185 Letters and Drawings of Bruno Schulz]], that contains some of these works. But those reproductions are few, and their quality far inferior. To my knowledge, this is the best gathering of the artists' pictorial works.<br /><br />How much more of his work was lost altogether?

The volume may help those still accumulating their first million dollars, but will best serve investors firmly established (most commonly through hard work, as opposed to inheritance) in the ranks of the wealthy.<br /><br />Unlike most investment or wealth-management books, offering run-of-the-mill suggestions on how to allocate their assets and invest, this book takes three separate tacks on the subject of money. The first, to which the editors devoted 98 pages, broadly covers the emotional issues surrounding money. That may seem odd. Money is not a touchy-feely thing. But as explained by family business CEO Susan Remmer Ryzewic, who is also a director of her family's foundation, wealth is a two-edged sword providing the freedom to pursue dreams, but can also create discomfort and take control of life.<br /><br />Judith Stern Peck, Director of the family wealthy and life project for the Ackerman Institute for the Family, notes in the second chapter how to overcome the significant challenges of parenting a wealthy family. Similarly, New York City attorney Robert Stephan Cohen shows that marriages have a much better chance of survival when couples create the same degree of financial protection for them as they do for business partnerships--by signing pre-nuptial agreements before they marry.<br /><br />Next, Neuberger Berman co-founder Roy Neuberger provides a lively chapter on the importance of working past retirement age. Mindful of two friends who had long planned their retirements--only to die at 65--Neuberger never retired. At 99, he's still working. Similarly, executive recruiter Janice Reals Ellig notes that those who succeed in a first career can often also succeed in a second. The book's first section concludes with chapters on strategic philanthropy, conflict resolution in family enterprise, and advice for holding successful family meetings.<br /><br />In the second eight-chapter section, readers get a fix on several important asset management strategies. Charlotte Beyer, CEO of the Institute for Private Investors, notes that for many wealthy investors, appointing a team is often the sanest way to manage their wealth. To choose from 20,000 registered investment advisors and 60,000 stock brokers in the U.S., she recommends sticking to common sense dictated by investment fundamentals and to clearly spell out goals and risk tolerance, and to interact with advisors. Tax attorney Charles Lowenhaupt similarly stresses the need to build a team of expert wealth counselors, committed to working collaboratively--and lead by a mediator and coordinator to unscramble technical matters. Investors willing to talk openly with them, he writes, will learn to value their common sense as much as their stock picks and tax recommendations.<br /><br />Sophisticates and novice investors alike can learn from the next two chapters on asset allocation and real estate investment options, by family officer executive Jonathan Spencer and securitized real estate specialist Richard Adler. The first stresses the need to construct objective financial profiles, set investment goals, realistic time horizons and risk tolerance levels and choose asset classes and benchmarks by which to measure their performance. The second outlines real estate's low correlation to other asset groups and outlines the many types of real estate assets and securities.<br /><br />Neuberger Berman Trust Co. Chairman Albert Bellas and Managing Director Diane Lederman inform readers about the use of trusts to preserve wealth across generations. Spiced with some scary statistics (gift and estate taxes can run as high as 55%) and real-life examples, these experienced trust officers show why trusts are both flexible and necessary. Ralph Sinsheimer, another NB trust official, discussed family foundations and theirneed to implement a \\"prudent investor\\" policy and standards outlining investment objectives, time horizon, required return, sensitivity to annual volatility, current and desired future charitable donations, and expected real growth in assets.<br /><br />Ellen Perry, the founder of a consulting firm on family offices, discusses the multiple chores required to manage great wealth. Success in this increasingly complex task, she advises, usually requires families to enlist a team of skilled and experienced professionals. She notes significant benefits and disadvantages of both multi-family and single-family offices and the increasing popularity of large trust companies, major banks and financial institutions. Likewise, famed trust attorney John Duncan explains how to find the right trust officers.<br /><br />The book's final, 35-page section offers readers four fine chapters on how to enjoy their wealth. This is hardly a treatise on how to be self-centered. There are two chapters on art collecting, one by Neuberger Berman art curator Michael Danoff, who was director and chief curator at the Des Moines Art Center for seven years. The clear implication is that the wealthy can also become benefactors, as shown by the example of Ralph Esmerian, who after becoming a great collector of American folk art and president of the American Folk Art Museum, in 2001 donated 400 of his pieces to it. The final two chapters explain how to use wealth to fulfill dreams (again, not a wholly self-centered enterprise), and how to remain secure at home and while traveling.<br /><br />This fine collection of original essays offers something to nearly everyone interested in how to manage their wealth.

The clear implication is that the wealthy can also become benefactors, as shown by the example of Ralph Esmerian, who after becoming a great collector of American folk art and president of the American Folk Art Museum, in 2001 donated 400 of his pieces to it. The final two chapters explain how to use wealth to fulfill dreams (again, not a wholly self-centered enterprise), and how to remain secure at home and while traveling.    This fine collection of original essays offers something to nearly everyone interested in how to manage their wealth. I cannot think of a better place to find the understanding needed to balance a good and fulfilling life with the just rewards of a lifetime of hard work.	2002-10-22

Murrah Building	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Read, and weep	This 556-page volume raises extremely important questions about the first major terrorist attack on U.S. shores, which was unfortunately not the last.<br /><br />In hindsight, some observers wonder whether the devastating 1995 attack was both precursor and connected to the Sept. 11, 2002 attacks on New York and Washington which took more than 3,000 lives.<br /><br />This research --- conducted by the Oklahoma Bombing Investigation Committee, and funded by private citizens and not to be confused with another government-produced book of the same [[ASIN:B0026I1IS2 name]]--- raises many unsettling questions.<br /><br />For starters it provides clear evidence that U.S. Federal authorities never found all of the perpetrators of the Oklahoma City attack, that they did not pursue every lead, and that they did not utilize all available physical evidence. Substantial evidence surfaced that dozens of crucial eyewitnesses were neither interviewed nor called at federal trials.<br /><br />In October 1995, Oklahoma State Representative Charles Key petitioned the District Court of Oklahoma County for a Grand jury to be formed to investigate the bombing. His petition was denied in February 1997.<br /><br />Nevertheless, an FBI agent swore in an affidavit included in this volume that Abraham Abdallah Ahmed, a Jordanian-born naturalized U.S. citizen detained by American Airlines security personnel in Chicago on April 19, 1995 met the description of one of the male suspects seen running from the scene of the bombing. Ahmed flew from Oklahoma City to Chicago after the bombing. The FBI man further swore that Ahmed's luggage, which continued to Rome, contained several car radios, substantial amounts of shielded and unshielded wire, a small tool kit and other tools. While these could be used for everyday work, they were also \\"consistent with use\\" for \\"explosive devices.\\" Ahmed was requested to appear before a Grand Jury, but had fled.<br /><br />The Grand Jury indicted Timothy McVeigh, along with \\"[[ASIN:1595552367 others unknown]].\\" Composites of two \\"others,\\" each called \\"John Doe,\\" are shown here. They were never found.<br /><br />In addition, actual evidence from terrorist attacks in Columbia in 1989, Saudi Arabia and Lima Peru in 1996 proved that a car bomb alone could not destroy reinforced concrete supports like those in the Alfred P. Murrah building. Chemical and electrical engineers, physicists and a U.S. Brigadier General all concurred that the damage to the Murrah Building on April 19, 1995 could not be ascribed to a single truck bomb containing 4,800 pounds of ammonium nitrate fuel oil.<br /><br />A former military man at the scene to search for victims on April 19 witnessed fire department teams removing two devices that were placed in bomb disposal units. These were described as \\"military olive drab in color,\\" the size of \\"round, five-gallon drums, with black lettering designating the contents as fulminated mercury,\\" a high grade explosive.

Lawrence painted both series and wrote the captions to tell the stories of hope and emancipation of African Americans.<br /><br />The first three essays, each running 10 to 12 pages, relate how Lawrence developed his series format and, specifically, how he developed the ideas and art in each of these two stories. He was influenced by a belief that African Americans, while not still enslaved, were in 1940 still in \\"an economic slavery.\\" The stories he featured, while historical, remained relevant to his own period as well. The fourth covers the imagery of struggle.<br /><br />Bold and unforgiving, Lawrence's vibrant works grew from his own childhood migration--from Atlantic City, New Jersey to Easton, Pennsylvania, to Philadelphia and finally, at 13, to Harlem, from his exposure to African-American culture--and his intensive training in the Utopia Children's House and New Deal-sponsored Harlem Art Workshop of the 1930s. In Harlem, he studied old masters like Giotto and Pieter Breughel the Elder and modern masters like Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cezanne and Henri Matisse.<br /><br />At that time, the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) was still funding public art murals, but Lawrence was too young to gain a commission. Instead, he determined to show the African-American struggle for freedom in real-life stories, tying past to present. From 1938 to 1941, he used the New York public library for research, creating in swift succession five series of paintings telling the stories of Toussaint L'Ouverture, Douglass, Tubman, John Brown, and The Migration of the Negro.<br /><br />In the middle two series, Lawrence hoped to speak artistically of the legendary escapes from slavery made by two African-American heroes, each of whom led the struggle for ultimate freedom for all. The paintings depicted beatings, coercion, repression and ultimately courageous escapes. The faces and bodies in these works speak of the brutality of slavery and the exhilaration that came from its escape. Lawrence wove bold colors and themes throughout the series, thereby joining each set of paintings into a whole.<br /><br />He succeeded, too, because these works are as beautiful and wild as anything ever created by van Gogh, and a great deal more hopeful.<br /><br />Even if you don't want to know all the personal and American history that Lawrence melded in the creation of these works--which I can't imagine--you will relish owning a book containing color plates of two entire series, complete with Lawrence's enthralling captions.<br /><br />This book is a gem.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

Stefan Maechler proves beyond any doubt that Wilkomirski is no such person and that Fragments is a fiction.<br /><br />The author pursued every possible lead. He compared each minute detail in Dossekker's narration of &#34;events&#34; with historical records from such leading Holocaust scholars as Raul Hilberg and Lawrence Langer, accounts of other child survivors, interviews with members of the Dossekker and Grosjean families and more.<br /><br />The most damning evidence Maechler unearthed is the fact that in 1981, Dossekker/Wilkomirski contested the will of Yvonne Grosjean, whom, in a letter to officials in Bern Siwtzerland, he called &#34;my birth mother.&#34; Dossekker/Wilkomirski received a third of her estate.<br /><br />Other damning evidence includes Dossekker/Wilkomirski's use of Laura Grabowski to &#34;corroborate&#34; his story. Grabowski claims to have known him in a children's home in Krakow. In fact, Grabowski is an American citizen of Christian faith who has since her youth fabricated stories about her victimhood, the most well-publicized being a book called Satan's Underground. The Social Security number of said Lauren Stratford is the same as that of Grabowski, who subsequently used it to make a false survivor's claim. Furthermore, Satan's Underground and Dossekker/Wilkomirski's book contain startling similarities.<br /><br />The one problem with Maechler's work concerns his questions about how such a fraud could be perpetrated. He concludes that the volume of Holocaust material made the fraud possible. In other words, he seems to be saying, too much Holocaust reportage exists.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this line of reasoning amounts to blaming the victim. There is something tawdry in blaming the commemoration and documentation of the worst crime in history for the appearance of a single fraud, or two. Naturally, Holocaust historians must guard against even the unintentional falsification of the record.<br /><br />But documenting the history is not a problem. The problem is that any evil of the Holocaust's enormity ever needed to be documented at all.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

It's easy to see why. Bold and unforgiving, these vibrant works grew from Lawrence's own childhood migration--from Atlantic City, New Jersey to Easton, Pennsylvania, to Philadelphia and finally, at 13, to Harlem--his exposure to African-American culture and his intensive training in the Utopia Children's House and New Deal-sponsored Harlem Art Workshop of the 1930s.<br /><br />At that time, the WPA was still funding public art murals, but Lawrence was too young to gain a commission. Instead, he determined to show the African-American struggle for freedom in real-life stories that would tie the past to the present.<br /><br />From 1938 to 1941, he used the New York public library for research, creating in swift succession five series of paintings telling the stories of Toussaint L'Ouverture, Tubman, Frederick Douglass, John Brown, and The Migration of the Negro.<br /><br />In the last of these, Lawrence hoped to speak artistically of a mass escape from the rural, discriminatory and unjust South--a region of poverty and illiteracy--into an anxious era of hope and expectation in the North. The paintings depicted passage, with railways, train cars, suitcases, and hordes of people constantly in motion. Their visages and body language spoke in terms of expectation and fear. Lawrence wove bold colors and themes throughout the series, thereby joining the paintings into a unit.<br /><br />In a documentary shown in a museum tour of Lawrence's work, the artist said he \\"didn't think in terms of history in that series. ...It was like I was doing a portrait of something.\\" Portraits were \\"a portrait of myself, a portrait of my family, a portrait of my peers.\\"<br /><br />Lawrence's extraordinary talent was recognized when he was only 24, with the 1941 exhibition of these paintings in the downtown gallery of art dealer Edith Halpert, who had beforehand exclusively shown the work of white artists. So breathtaking were the paintings (as they remain), they instantly transported Lawrence across the U.S. racial divide of that era, making him deservedly famous. The Philips Gallery in Washington D.C. purchased the odd-numbered paintings; the Museum of Modern Art in New York took the even ones.<br /><br />Treat your kids to this triumph of the human spirit, and to the fine accompanying Myers poem.

Books	5	131	148	N	N	Large implications	If you've read Steven Emerson's [[ASIN:0743234359 American Jihad]], Ellen Harris' [[ASIN:0025483358 Guarding the Secrets]], Robert Baer's [[ASIN:140004684X See No Evil]] and keep current with the work of the Middle East Media Research Institute and Middle East Quarterly, Ledeen's book won't provide many revelations. You'll know that Sunni and Shi'ite Islamists work together in a worldwide terror network, Wahhabi Saudis finance radical Muslim groups worldwide, Iran's mullahs have long linked with Yassir Arafat, and terrorist Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other radical leaders operate openly in mosques and schools throughout the U.S. And that FBI doctrine called \\"criminal predicate\\" requires evidence of plans or criminal action before agents can aggressively pursue terrorists.<br /><br />But Ledeen's new information is a bombshell: In 1996, the Clinton administration rejected not one, but three, Sudanese offers to watch bin Laden, provide his connections to Hizbollah and Hamas--or turn him over to U.S. authorities. In 1997, the U.S. again refused the Sudan's offer to nail bin Laden, even preventing transfer of crucial data to Britain. Only in the late 2001 did the U.S. get the information.<br /><br />He ties together many crucial strands of evidence--including damning new ones--into a coherent piece. Ledeen shows that the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on America were the result of bureaucracy gone to seed. The Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton administrations all lost the will to pursue basic security measures in the U.S. and internationally.<br /><br />Many reasons dictated that the U.S. get serious about terrorism after the Ayatollah Khomeini's violent overthrow of Iran's Shah in 1979. But Ledeen notes that things got especially dicey under Clinton's watch. In 1993, the World Trade Center was bombed, a plot was uncovered to bomb the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, Oklahoma City was bombed, explosives were stopped en route to Los Angeles before the millennium, two embassies were bombed in Kenya and Tanzania, and the USS Cole was bombed in Aden.<br /><br />Ledeen shows, however, that Clinton sat on his hands. Advice from Treasury Secretary Rubin, George Stephanopoulos, Madeline Albright and others scuttled several anti-terror measures--such as shutting bank accounts of terrorist front organizations, giving terrorist watch lists to airline security men, or linking visa expirations to the duration of drivers' licenses.<br /><br />Rather, Clinton fell prey to the false notion that terrorism could be controlled via peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But the Clinton administration \\"inverted the real problem,\\" Ledeen rightly concludes. For the conflict has full support from \\"the terror masters in Syria, Iran, and Iraq\\" and is \\"generously funded by Saudi Arabia.\\" The terrorist war against Israel, Ledeen shows, is a war against an American presence in the Middle East. \\"Peace could not be achieved without dealing with Iran, Iraq, Syria and Saudi Arabia,\\" he notes.<br /><br />Straining \\"to avoid conflict\\" with these terrorist states at all costs, Ledeen reports, Clinton inadvisably shuttered the 1995 investigation of Islamic terrorist charities, which would have exposed the full extent of Saudi complicity in global money laundering. In northern Virginia alone, the investigation had already \\"turned up more than $1 billion in Saudi contributions to four interlinked Islamic 'foundations, institutes, and charities'.\\" Closing them then, former federal prosecutor John Loftus charges, would have prevented millions of dollars from funding hundreds of suicide terror attacks. In March 2002, George W. Bush shut down the same charities that were investigated in 1995.<br /><br />The U.S. had tied itself in a tight knot, writes Ledeen. The FBI could not keep newspaper clippings or files on suspected and known terrorists. The CIA was prohibited by Executive Order #11905 from talking to them. After 1976, CIA agents were not allowed even to associate with assassins--which meant it could not recruit terrorists, whose primary business was, after all, assassination. William Casey's CIA successfully skirted that executive order, Ledeen reports, under the direction of Middle East case officer Duane Clarridge, whose men caused the implosion of Abu Nidal's terrorist ring. But Casey died and Clarridge was purged in the Iran-Contra scandal.<br /><br />The CIA grew so bureaucratic, Ledeen reports, that the Tower Commission (headed by former Senators John Tower and Edmund Muskie and General Brent Scowcroft) reported the name of a valuable Iranian mole--who was predictably murdered shortly thereafter.<br /><br />Worse, a closed 1979 Congressional hearing caused the CIA to dangerously downgrade the PLO from a \\"terrorist\\" to \\"moderate\\" organization. Nevermind, Ledeen notes, that Yassir Arafat's PLO worked \\"hand in glove with Islamic radicals like the Muslim Brotherhood\\" (of which he and his father were both members), radicals in Egypt and Syria, and terrorist groups like Germany's Baader-Meinhof and Italy's Red Brigades. It had secretly figured \\"in Ayatollah Khomeini's seizure of power in Iran.\\" Arafat trained the hardcore Iranian Revolutionary Guards, created the Abu Nidal group, which carried out his terror instructions, and made global terrorism a force to reckon with. He was (and is) key to the formation and function of the international terror network.<br /><br />Ledeen suggests that Soviet CIA and FBI moles Aldrich Ames, Harold Nicholson and Robert Hanssen successfully deflected implicating the Soviets in international terrorism. In 1985, he writes, the CIA turned down KGB defector Vasili Mitrokhin's offered treasure trove of data. He had hand-copied thousands of KGB documents--including names of thousands of Soviet agents working as Western politicians, journalists, moviemakers, military officers and diplomats--and Soviet connections to global terrorist leaders. This gave Al Qaeda a gestation period free from scrutiny, Ledeen reports, and cost the CIA several opportunities to meet with Ahmad Shah Massoud in northern Afghanistan. In Iraq, Ledeen writes, \\"one could fill a small volume with accounts of failed [CIA] coup attempts.\\"<br /><br />The U.S. can defeat Islamist terrorists, Ledeen concludes in part by targeting Syria, implicated in both the 1983 Hizbollah bombing of the Beirut embassy and recent support of Al Qaeda.

Still sensitive to his failure to make fourth grade on time, Joshua at first refused to stand up to the gang.<br /><br />That made things worse for him. They put the whole school on the defensive, but Joshua got the brunt of their nastiness--until, that is, they decided to pick on a new kid in the class who had no friends and liked Joshua. Worse, Joshua's mother told him to be nice to the new boy.<br /><br />The N.O.s plotted and planned and pulled a very nasty prank, which worried the entire class, and all the teachers. It was up to Joshua to set things straight. And this he did, managing to put the class bully and his clique in their place. How, I can't say.<br /><br />Parents, take note. This book is \\"just right\\" for kids moving on from early chapter readers. It's challenging but not too hard, and the charmer story line keeps them turning the pages.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

There, Carl deposits her into a toy truck, which collides gently with a stack of stuffed animals.<br />Next stop is the book department, where the baby finds (appropriately) a picture book on Rottweilers. Visits to the hat, television, carpet and fine foods departments ensue. Of course the story would not be complete without a stop in the pet deparment, where delightful mischief transpires.<br />I won't spoil the ending, but parents willing to laugh with their children will find this and Alexandra Day's other Carl books a delightful way to introduce them to words.

Of course, the people who most need directions might not read them. But parents can best use children's books by reading with their children, not by handing them over, unread, as baby-sitting substitutes. This develops in children an outsized ability to communicate -- and much-needed senses of inquiry, humor and fun, particularly if book discussions, however elementary, result.<br /><br />Which brings me to this fictional picture story for infants and toddlers, first published in 1985. The mother left Carl, a Rottweiler, to look after her baby while she went out. The obvious impossibility of this situation is precisely what renders the story so delightful to most kids.<br /><br />The baby played on her mother's vanity table, messing with the powder. She took a swim in the goldfish tank, got into the refrigerator and dumped food and milk on the kitchen floor (which Carl tracked about), slid down the laundry shoot and took a bath. Every child must learn to clean up, and Carl set a fine example.<br /><br />Carl's success prompted the author to create an entire Carl series. In each vignette, the mother asked Carl to look after her baby, and together the baby and dog always got into new mischief.<br /><br />Pure fun accounts for the wild success of this book and series. Evidently, most parents realize that laughing with children over books can teach them many things, including the early ability to distinguish fact from fiction--and that using words like \\"silly\\" and \\"trouble\\" can make this understandable even to babies under one year.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

It ought to be on the list of children's bestsellers, for it gives children the stories of two American heroes for the price of one. The first is the title figure, Harriet Tubman (1820-1913), who escaped from slavery but courageously returned south 19 times to lead more than 300 others to freedom. The second is Jacob Lawrence (1917-2000), who made this magnificent series of illustrations in 1939 and 1940.<br />The text is poetic. Early in the story, on a hot summer day in about 1820, \\"a group of slave children were tumbling in the sandy soil in the state of Maryland,\\" Harriet Tubman among them. She dreamed of freedom and escaped, but returned to help others. The story builds as the selfless African-American leader risked her life many times to help others reach freedom. \\"Some were afraid, / But none turned back, / For close at their heels / Howled the bloodhound pack.\\"<br />As the story closes, young readers find an enthralling figure of Harriet Tubman building support for the anti-slavery movement. At every convention within 500 miles, she could be found speaking in words and tones that brought tears to the eyes and sorrow to the hearts of all listeners.<br />Lawrence's paintings, made in tempera colors and poster paints, are poetic, too. Trained in the art workshops of Harlem in the 1930s, including the Utopia Children's House and the Harlem Art Workshop (sponsored by the New Deal), Lawrence became one of the finest African-American artists in U.S. history. His extraordinary talent was recognized when he was still relatively young.<br />Born in Atlantic City, New Jersey, he moved to Easton, Pennsylvania and then at seven to Philadelphia. At 13, Jacob moved again, to Harlem. Drawing on Bible stories and the powerful Christian sermons, often given on street corners, Lawrence remembered orators who spoke with reverence of Harriet Tubman and determined to show the African-American struggle for freedom in his art.<br />The Tubman series was one of Lawrence's earliest. It predated by only a couple of years the 60-panel migration series that made Lawrence's career in 1941-42. Half that series was bought by the Philips Gallery in Washington D.C. and the other half by the Museum of Modern Art in New York.<br />But Lawrence's Tubman work is among his best. This book's only shortcoming is that it does not reproduce all of the Tubman paintings. Several were excluded and can be seen only in an art museum, or the pages of an art catalogue. But don't let that stop you. Children will find themselves doubly enriched. Alyssa A. Lappenerican struggle for freedom in his art.<br />The Tubman series was one of Lawrence's earliest.

She was separated from her aged, ill parents, who were left to fend for themselves, having been worn out by cruel masters. Hell followed for Isabella, for her new master spoke English while she spoke Dutch--like most people in the Hudson valley. For not understanding, he whipped her so hard that her back bore the scars all the rest of her life.<br />She was sold to a tavern-keeper and, when she was 13, to a neighboring farmer named John Dumont. At 16, she was six feet tall and could do the work of any man. She was forced to wed, against her will, and bore four daughters and a son. In 1817, New York enacted a law that would free all slaves on July 4, 1827. By then, Isabella was 28. But when Dumont reneged on his promise to free her, she ran to a nearby farm, believing that its abolitionist owners would save her. The Van Wageners bought and freed her.<br />Dumont, however, sold her son Peter to an Alabama plantation owner. To sell a slave out-of-state was then illegal in New York. Isabella took the unheard-of step of hiring a white lawyer to plead a court case for the return of her son. She won, he returned, she sent him to school, and he became a sailor on a whaling ship.<br />After Peter left, Isabella dreamed that she should travel the U.S. and tell people of her bondage. She took the name of Sojourner Truth. The final pages of this adventure tell some of the accomplishments of this American heroine. The illustrations greatly compliment the story, accentuating the iron will of a woman who would not be bought, or silenced.<br />The book concludes with a one-page author's note and a chronology of the events of Sojourner Truth's life. In the former, the author writes of those times when evil rules, and good people feel called upon to tell the truth to those who do not wish to hear.<br />Sojourner Truth was such a person, and she lived in such a time.

Thick-bound comic books like this one have replaced them. And fortunately, comics make kids into readers.<br /><br />I was delighted the other day when a neighbor gave me five Calvin and Hobbes volumes, including this one. The books have already encouraged hours of reading for each child.<br /><br />This collection opens with a 10-page poem narrated by a child --- Calvin, it turns out  --- afraid to sleep at night lest monsters snatch him in his sleep. Only in the morning, he feared, would his parents<br /><br />\\"surmise/<br /><br />The gruesomeness of my demise/<br /><br />And see that my remains are in a heap!\\"<br /><br />(One parent, in this musing, appears with a bone in one hand, and a shrug of the shoulders, though the kid wakes up fine the next day.)<br /><br />Another 79 comic strips follow, ranging in length from one or two pages to five, and filling a total of 255 pages. Rare is the 250 page-book that a young boy or girl will gladly consume in one sitting. Trust me, this is one of them.

Her chapters on the founding of modern Israel are especially strident.<br /><br />She describes Zionism's early years almost entirely from an Arab point of view, consistently defending and minimizing the significance of Arab violence against Jews, who by the 1850s comprised the majority of Jerusalem's population.<br /><br />The book, in this vein, completely omits the Arab riots of 1921, in which dozens of Jews were murdered in Jerusalem and throughout Israel. Similarly, Armstrong gives only a cryptic account of the 1929 Arab riots, providing merely the numbers of casualties, without the significant details regarding both the slaughter of Jews, in their homes, and widespread Arab burning and looting of Jerusalem's Jewish property, both within the city limits and the suburbs--including the Arab massacre of more than 67 unarmed Jewish students and their families in Hebron, which exterminated a Jewish community more than 400 years old.<br /><br />Concerning the late 1930s period, Armstrong sympathizes greatly with Arab desires to bar Jews from Palestine and Jerusalem, even though doing so meant their certain extermination in Hitler's death camps. Plainly, Armstrong applauds Britain's illegal 1939 White Paper, which closed Palestine's doors to them--in defiance of the League of Nations mandate naming Palestine a national home for the Jewish people.<br /><br />The account also includes many errors. For example, concerning an April 13 1948 Arab attack, Armstrong misleads readers, claiming that the convoy was \\"carrying Irgun terrorists, who had been wounded at Deir Yassin, to the Mount Scopus Medical Center.\\" In the first place, the convoy included only one Irgun member wounded at Deir Yassin. In the second, 78 Jewish medical staff--not 40, as Armstrong mis-states--were murdered. In the third, all 78 of those Jewish medical persons were also dismembered, a significant detail that Armstrong unaccountably excludes.<br /><br />Likewise, Armstrong excised any reference to failed defense by Jerusalem's Jewish people against the 1948 Arab siege--or that their Arab attackers starved and bombed Jerusalem's Jewish majority into submission, forcing them to abandon their ancient capital.<br /><br />Armstrong claims that \\"On 16 March 1949, Israel and Jordan signed a formal agreement accepting the armistice lines as the legitimate borders between their two states.\\" In reality, Jordan (like all Arab states) refused to recognize the state of Israel, much less to accept the cease-fire lines as Israel's legitimate borders.<br /><br />In a similar fashion, Armstrong misconstrues UN Resolution 242 as a \\"requirement\\" that Israel \\"withdraw from the territories it had occupied during the Six Day War.\\" As international legal scholars and the resolution's own authors have noted time and again, Security Council resolution 242 requires only that Israel withdraw from \\"territories,\\" not all \\"the\\" territories--and that requirement also stipulated that the withdrawal lines were to be determined by negotiation between the parties, negotiations that the Arab states illegally refused to conduct.<br /><br />Probably worst of all is Armstrong's failure to recognize Jordan's illegal occupation of Jerusalem, from 1948 to 1967, as illegal, and its violation of international law, in prohibiting Jews from residing in, worshiping in, or even from entering, the eastern half of the city during that time. This violated both League of Nations and U.N. mandates, but Armstrong contends that Israel's Jordanian attackers in 1967 were the heroes, as she takes care to note that \\"two hundred [Jordanian Arabs] died in defense of the Holy City...\\" But Jerusalem was never legally part of Jordan.<br /><br />Of course, 1967 Arab aggression against Israel made Israel's acquisition of Jerusalem perfectly legal under all existing international law. But mostastounding of all is Armstrong's refusal to recognize thousands of years of Jewish history in Jerusalem, which she brushes aside with the statement that \\"Israel's claim to [Jerusalem] is dubious.\\"<br /><br />No, the only dubious things here are Armstrong's knowledge of history and her understanding of international law.<br /><br />Read Conor C.

But kids learn that the Jewish people comprise a diverse and vibrant global community whose traditions herald from virtually every region of the planet, including Israel, Africa, the Arab Middle East, South America and of course America and Eastern and Western Europe.<br />The book opens with a full-page watercolor illustration of the globe. \\"There are Jews living all over the world,\\" the author notes, showing speech bubbles saying \\"Hi, I'm Jewish\\" in 17 languages.<br />The next two-page spread shows children in a wide array of dress, playing together on swings and a slide. \\"We do not look alike. We do not dress alike.\\"<br />The third spread opens with the comment, \\"We do not pray alike.\\" And here children visit the prayer services from Tunis to Belgium and London.<br />But, children learn, all Jewish people share \\"a believe in one God, in Torah, in Shabbat\\" (and here they see a two-page spread of the world of animals and plants, with a rainbow painted over with the universal part of every Jewish prayer, Shalom, \\"Peace.\\")<br />They also see that all Jewish people have synagogues, from Leningrad (you can tell this book was written before the Iron Curtain fell), Ethiopia, Kingston Jamaica and Prague.<br />Another highlight included is of course the Jewish prayer, the Shema, and the common use of Hebrew as a liturgical language.<br />And while Jewish people all love to eat, dance, sing, and celebrate Jewish holidays, the foods from varied regions are as diverse as the other customs.<br />From this generalized introduction, the book moves on to the Jewish holidays themselves, each one explained in a two page spread beginning with Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur and moving on to Sukkot, Simchat Torah, Chanukah, Tu B'Shevat, Purim and Pesach. This list of holidays include a few modern ones as well--Yom Hashoah, the remembrance of six million murdered in the Holocaust, and Yom Ha-Atzmaut, Israel's birthday--and with Shavuot, the celebration of the gift of Torah.<br />But unlike many explanations of Judaism for small children, this book does not stop with the Holy Days and Festivals. It also includes life-cycle events, such as naming ceremonies for Jewish girls and Brit Milot for boys, the critical position of study in Jewish life, and the Bar and Bat Mitzvah for boys and girls.

They build huts with roofs fashioned from fruits and vegetables--and open to the stars--in which to eat their meals. Daily festival ceremonies require a perfectly shaped etrog, and a lulav (or palm branch) adorned with the leaves of myrtle and willow, symbolizing eyes and heart.<br />As this story opens, Yedidya was five years old, and excitedly awaiting Sukkot, for his father had ordered him his very own etrog from Israel. But when the package arrived, and he opened it, the etrog was all mushy and brown, not at all the perfect fruit required to celebrate the holiday. Yedidya was crestfallen. But then he got an idea. He peeled the etrog, gently picked out its seed, placed it in some dampened cotton and watered it every morning and night.<br />After a long time, despite his brother's jokes, the etrog seed sprouted. He put it in a small pot, covered it with earth and watered it week after week until a tiny green point erupted from the soil. His sister laughed and said it would never grow. But Yedidya tended the pot, wrapping it on the window sill against the winter drafts, and in the spring, planted the sapling etrog tree outside.<br />The next year, when Yedidya was six, there was still no etrog. His father told him growing fruit would take three years and that he could not pick the fruit until the tree was four. Worse, he had never heard of an etrog tree growing in Australia.<br />Yedidya, of course, was not to be discouraged. The years passed, the tree grew, and what do you suppose happened? I can't tell. But boys are like trees. They grow, and the wise ones bear good fruit. Alyssa A. Lappen. Lappen	2002-09-08

(An appropriate question for Passover, or Pessah.)<br />It opens with an order of the Seder meal, illustrated with colorful and somehow very realistic clay figures showing each part of the service.<br />From beginning to end, each page also includes large vibrant illustrations--photographs of clay figurines, actually--that bring the Passover story alive for children and adults alike. The book opens with Passover table set with clay candles, wine, Haggadah, matzoh and a clay Seder plate containing all the symbols to be used in the retelling of the Jewish people's escape from slavery in Egypt thousands of years ago. (These are of course a roasted lamb bone, hard boiled egg, maror or bitter vegetable, chopped fruit, and greens to dip in the salt water that symbolizes tears.)<br />Blessings for all the major portions of the service are included in Hebrew and English.<br />The Four Questions--undoubtedly the highlight of the Passover Seder for all children who must ask them--are likewise included in Hebrew and English, beginning with \\"How different this night is from every other night of the year. Every other night we eat bread or matzah. Why do we eat only matzah tonight?\\"<br />A clay figure of a bow-tied young boy wearing a kipah appears at the Seder table to encourage children to proceed with their questions, which for shy ones can be very daunting indeed.<br />The best part of the Haggadah, though, comes in the retelling of the Passover story, complete with clay illustrations of ancient Jewish people forced to build the Egyptian Pharaoh's pyramids and the ten plagues that God sent to Egypt when Pharaoh refused to grant Moses plea.<br />Children love the illustrations of traditional Passover songs like Had Gadya, as well as those of sages of old, Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah, Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Tarfon discussing the Passover story until the wee hours of the night. Kids even like the clay figures of idols that the Jewish people were instructed not to worship.<br />The Haggadah service closes with the ancient prayer of Jews whose ancestors were forced to leave their beloved Jerusalem by waves of conquerors through the ages, \\"Next year in Jerusalem,\\" and a two-page color spread of the spiritual capital established by King David in Biblical times.<br />But the story and the playfulness don't end there.

Lippman wrote in the Washington Post, have explained so lucidly the complex developments of Muslim history.<br />It is difficult to address the questions of Islam, the Arabs and their relations with Israel and remain nonpartisan. But Business Week's Ronald Taggiasco called Pipes' scholarly explanation of events and faith in that little-known, volatile, and important part of the world well worth reading.<br />Pipes' reasoned, literate explanation of what generated the Islamic resurgence goes a long way to explaining recent events. Written in 1983, this book provided the first comprehensive political study of Islam's extraordinary role in modern world. We are fortunate indeed that Transaction has rescued the political and global implications of the Islamic revival, revealed here, from the out-of-print category, complete with a new preface for 2002.<br />The book is divided into three sections. The first covers the premodern legacy of Islam's sacred laws and its failure to implement the public ideal represented by those laws--as existed in the single state for Muslims (Dar al-Islam) from 622 to 753 A.D. According to Pipes, for most of Muslim history, traditional Muslims were willing to accept the gap between the ideal and the actual, to live with a less-than-complete implementation of Shari'a, although the Muslim approach to politics derived from the \\"invariant premises of the religion\\" established more than 1,500 years ago.<br />The second section covers Islam's encounters with the West, beginning with the matched powers of Crusaders against the Ayyubids, and proceeding quickly to Napoleon's 1789 invasion of Egypt. (This prompted the Ottoman Sultan Selim III to declare Jihad against the French and join the infidel British and Russian empires to keep his own in tact).<br />Muslims had ruled millions of Christians in Europe for 450 years before being displaced by Turkey. Then the western cultural onslaught began in the first half of the 18th century, and ran from Umma's eastern end (China and Indonesia) to its west (Crimea). By the end of 1919, only Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Arabia and Yemen retained political independence, the first three by balancing the claims of Britain against those of Russia and the latter two simply by being remote and completely barren. Meanwhile, the Muslim Empire had also lost battles of scientific, technical, mechanical, geographic and historical knowledge. Even daily Western life differed markedly from that of the Islamic east. Thus fundamentalists began lobbying for strict Shari'a everywhere in the Umma.<br />In contrast, reformist Muslims argue that traditional Shari'a is hopelessly illiberal and conflicts with the true Qur'anic values. They reject Shari'a traditions emanating from Hadith, consensus of the 'ulama and reasoning by analogy as inauthentic and outdated, respectively. Similarly, they approve of parliamentary systems of government, but view hold their record in Islamic society in contempt. On some fronts, liberal views conflict with themselves. While they admire pan-Islamic solidarity they are not committed to it; and they recognize national interests but disapprove of Muslim states fighting one another. And as for non-Muslims, according to Pipes, reformists are caught by ambiguity, between their desire for equal status for all and the wish for Dhimmi laws that traditional Islamic states use to bestow a special place on Muslims, while relegating all non-Muslims to inferior, even slavish conditions. The fact that Westernization did not markedly improve the Muslim world in the 1970s led to increasing fundamentalism.<br />Pipes devotes the third section to Islam in current affairs, detailing the effects of the fundamentalist surge on 22 Muslim-dominated nations from Indonesia, Afghanistan and Pakistan in Central Asia and Asia to Algeria, Morocco and Egypt in Africa and Syria, Iran and Iraq, in the Middle East. In at least 8 other nations, from Malaysia to Nigeria, Muslims vie with non-Muslims for power. In one of these--the Sudan--the conflict has grown bloody since this book was written, forcing millions into subjugation and slavery. Pipes also reviews 20 areas, including the former Soviet Union, where Muslims account for less than a quarter of the population but are asserting themselves. Pipes includes an extensive 50-plus page look at the means that the oil boom provided to promote Islam. Oil is behind the political importance of Saudi Arabia, and the Iranian Revolution, for example.<br />But Pipes also concludes that an Islamic revival dependant on oil constitutes a mirage, for the cash that oil provides cannot last forever. This, Pipes predicts, will leave the Islamic world with a choice that has become increasingly urgent--to adapt and come to terms with global Westernization, or to accept apologetics, introversion and poverty.<br />This broad treatment remains as helpful in understanding current events as when it was written nearly 20 years ago.

Oil is behind the political importance of Saudi Arabia, and the Iranian Revolution, for example. <br />But Pipes also concludes that an Islamic revival dependant on oil constitutes a mirage, for the cash that oil provides cannot last forever. This, Pipes predicts, will leave the Islamic world with a choice that has become increasingly urgent--to adapt and come to terms with global Westernization, or to accept apologetics, introversion and poverty. <br />This broad treatment remains as helpful in understanding current events as when it was written nearly 20 years ago.

He had legendary strength and was so smart he could add columns of large numbers in his head in seconds flat. His wife Pearl played the mandolin. She could draw and sew lacy butterflies and birds in swirling plumes, and designed fancy buttons from seashells in the family's tiny button factory. At their restaurant--whose menu featured mushroom, herb and barley soup, homemade noodles and fresh bread--the family often also offered plays late at night.<br />Their village was set in a fern-filled forest near a river clear as glass. Pink-legged white storks nested atop the chimneys and geese, goats and wildflowers danced beside the winding country roads.<br />But when the Goodsteins' children Ida, Sammy and Ruthie were respectively four, three and one, war and hatred forced them to leave their home forever. As World War I raged, Abba stood outside his restaurant one day and was surrounded by Cossacks who pointed rifles at his chest. He fearlessly began singing a Cossack marching song in his brilliant strong voice. The soldiers left him, laughing and singing, too. Once, three soldiers stopped Pearl's father as they rode in their family cart, threatening to cut off the beard which Jewish law required him to wear. Abba knocked the soldier out and the other two fled.<br />An honest rabbi was killed one afternoon for wiping his forehead in an open window: He was shot as a spy trying to send signals to the enemy. While they sheltered the family from the shooting, family \\"friends\\" gave all the Goodsteins' things away, explaining afterwards that the Jews were going to be killed anyway.<br />Abba Goodstein wrote to his sister Yitta who had moved to Knoxville, Tennessee in 1907. Another 18 pages of true-life adventures follow the family's escape in August 1921. I won't spoil the exciting details, but the story is perfect for independent readers 9-and-up, or makes a fine read-aloud. Alyssa A.

It is best suited for children up to about 10 or 11.<br /><br />Much as we might like to, it's a mistake to teach children that no one ever hurts others, and Moser doesn't try. He starts by telling kids the truth--every day someone hits, kicks or shoots someone.<br /><br />Why do people behave so violently? Sometimes, they do so because they want things that belong to others, or want to tell them what to do. Sometimes they are so angry they can't control themselves or they want attention.<br /><br />Sometimes they have seen too much violence on TV, in movies or in video games, which can all make violence look and sound exciting. Children may think, &#34;Wow, those things look like fun.&#34; They want to drive fast cars and smash them, learn how to fight and knock people down or get a gun and shoot it. They may even want to learn to make bombs and blow up buildings.<br /><br />This book, published in 2001, may well have been written after September 11. The simple illustrations definitely suggest the terrible pain of that trauma, albeit in as non-threatening a way as possible. The story also explains that while it may be fun to watch people do violent things in movies, games and on TV, they are pretend. When the shows and games end, the actors go home.<br /><br />But in real life, it is not fun to be threatened. People can be hurt by violence. They can really die. It's not fun to be in a car wreck, knocked around by a school yard bully or to have a gun aimed at you. Getting shot is not fun.<br /><br />Violence is not new to the world, Moser explains. For thousands of years, people fought, using their fists, and their teeth, and later on, rocks, clubs, knives, spears, bows and arrows and finally guns.<br /><br />None of these things are good or bad, the author explains. &#34;They are simply tools.&#34; Guns and spears, bows and arrows can be good for hunting and knives may be used to cut meat and vegetables.<br /><br />But sometimes people use tools as weapons. Robbers carry guns to steal from others, and sometimes kill.<br /><br />People who do these things are a menace to themselves and others. Why would anyone want to be a menace? They shoot and kill other people, hurting the friends and families of their victims. Sometimes their victims are little children.<br /><br />About 2/3 through, the author turns to 10 methods kids can use to deal with these problems. Some will help children shape their own attitudes towards violent individuals who can hurt themselves and others. Others concern how kids should consider violent games and TV and things they can do instead of watching or playing such things.<br /><br />The tools offered here are sensible and should help children understand the dangers around them, how they can react responsibly to others' violent actions and how they might channel their own anger.<br />---Alyssa A.

A child who moved into Yonderville worried about where he would find friends. Then the circus arrived in town. Well, not actually in town. It arrived across a field from the boy's house, and had come to a dead end. The engineer had taken the wrong track, and was forced to stop by a collapsed bridge.

You can just imagine.<br /><br />There's lots later on about how sharks swim and breathe, see, hear and smell, how they hunt and how they bear and raise their young. The shark's 150 million year history is also detailed.<br /><br />Kids even get some lessons on the reasons that sharks are endangered today, and what they can do about it.<br /><br />But frankly, I don't appreciate this book. The four pages on killer sharks and their attacks undo all the good the book contains. Those four pages scared my son so much he couldn't get to sleep.<br /><br />Don't buy this.

The world has changed a lot since the prolific genius Suess (aka Theodore S. Geisel) penned this classic tale in 1950. The expanse of time, however, has not rendered this rhymed story any less fun for the younger set than it was then.<br /><br />True enough, young Gerald McGrew complains that the lions and tigers in a pretty good zoo are \\"awfully old-fashioned\\"---before dreaming about catching new ones in an equally old-fashioned way.<br /><br />But most readers---in fact, all but the biggest of stuffed shirts---will quickly forget the politically incorrect aspects of the cages and trap-doodles McGrew imagines taking to the wild mountains of Zomba-ma-Tant and Tobsk, not to mention Motta-fa-Potta-fa-Pell and Hippo-no-Hungus. The machines are pretty amusing--including the Skeegle-mobile, the Bad-Animal-Catching-Machine and the Cooker-mobile.<br /><br />Travelers through these pages also encounter the gol-darndest lion, with ten feet; topknot hens, an Elephant-Cat, a Gusset, a Gherkin, a Gasket, a Tufted Mazurka, a Nerkle, a Nerd, a Bippo-no-Bungus---the list goes on and on---and a Seersucker too (get it?).<br /><br />If he ran the zoo, Gerald would make a few changes, that's just what he'd do.

1476634:US	52709697	R1TK2S8JD0OAE7	157488414X	349079098	The Liberty Incident: The 1967 Attack on the U.S. Navy Spy Ship	Books	5	7	12	N	N	Conclusive	Recent American military history is replete with accidents, each of which cost dozens of lives. In May 1987, an Iraqi Entendard jet fired Exocet missiles into the destroyer Stark, killing 37 U.S. Navy men. Other disasters included the 1968 Pueblo, 1969 U.S. Navy EC-131 and 1975 Mayaguez incidents--and of course the Black Hawk in 1994. In each case, the U.S. was at peace. These incidents were mostly soon forgotten.<br /><br />But for 35 years, the USS Liberty has been a festering wound. More than 100 books were written about the incident, which still routinely figures in news and magazine articles.<br /><br />In 1986, a professor suggested to A. Jay Cristol that his U.S. Navy, international law and judicial backgrounds uniquely qualified him to examine the facts of the case. He then began an investigation that spanned 14 years.<br /><br />A retired U.S. Navy Captain A. Jay Cristol, accessed every living and written source he could locate, including more than 500 witnesses he interviewed in four nations. He reviewed five television productions, more than 100 books, hundreds of articles, and more than 3,087 documents--including all those from at least ten official U.S. investigations and three official Israeli ones.<br /><br />Throughout, Cristol focused on the one (right) question--whether the attacking Israelis knew that their target was an U.S. ship. In 1986, Cristol did not know the answer. Nor did he, like many discredited conspiracy theorists, assume that Israel maliciously premeditated the attack against a vessel they knew to be American.<br /><br />Every official investigation had concluded that while intentional, the attack was also clearly a case of mistaken identity. After conducting the most extensive research ever on this topic--Cristol agreed. Several Israeli and American mistakes caused Israeli forces to mistake the USS Liberty for an Egyptian vessel.<br /><br />Cristol admirably establishes the peak Cold War context in which the incident occurred. Only five years earlier, the U.S. had humiliated the Soviet Union during the Cuban Missile Crisis, forcing it with the threat of superior nuclear and naval power to back down. Nikita Khrushchev, who was deposed in 1964, consequently had accelerated warship construction to try to gain Soviet command of the high seas.<br /><br />Superpower naval confrontations naturally followed. Soviet vessels would follow U.S. warships and intentionally interfere with their operations, particularly in the Mediterranean. Often, Soviet or U.S. destroyers would steer on a collision course for their adversaries in high-stakes naval games of \\"chicken.\\" Ships bumped in many instances. The escalation eventually led to the 1972 Incidents at Sea Agreement, but in 1967, incidents still occurred regularly.<br /><br />The Vietnam conflict was also in full swing. In fact on June 2, 1967, U.S. Air Force fighter-bombers accidentally attacked the Soviet merchant ship Turkestan in Cam Pha Harbor in North Vietnam--just when Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin's was set to arrive to deliver a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.<br /><br />The rapidly deteriorating situation described at length in Michael Oren's, [...], became full-scale war on June 5, 1967 when Israel sent its entire airforce to destroy Egypt's Air Force in less than 80 minutes. Many Arab leaders vocally (and falsely) charged the U.S. and Britain with supplying the attack aircraft to Israel, even when they knew otherwise.<br /><br />Within the Israeli forces there were frictions as well. When the war broke out, Israel's Air Force had 76 state-of-the-art Mirage fighter jets, plus Super Mystere B-2s, Mystere IV's and a cadre of well-trained pilots. By contrast, the Israeli Navy had only three obsolete destroyers, nine motor torpedo boats (three then deployed in the Red Sea) and some miscellaneous small craft. Israeli inter-service rivalries were palpable.<br /><br />On May 23, the Liberty, an U.S. National Security Agency intelligence vessel, was ordered to take a position 13 miles off Port Said, Egypt. Such ships often sailed off various coasts to listen, record signal emissions, chart their sources' locations, and gather any data of political or military use in the Cold War. NSA civilian employee Frank Raven protested sending the Liberty into a potential war zone. But his lone voice of dissension was overruled.<br /><br />On May 24, when the Liberty began steaming 3,000 nautical miles from the Ivory Coast to the Straits of Gibraltar, the Cairo newspapers reported that Egypt had mined the Straits of Tiran.<br /><br />On May 27, U.S. Admiral John S. McCain, Jr. ordered U.S. Sixth Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Martin not to operate aircraft within 100 nautical miles of Egypt's coast. When the Liberty arrived in Rota, Spain, linguists trained in Arabic and Russian reported aboard. None assigned to the ship spoke Hebrew.<br /><br />On June 6, Israel destroyed more than 150 Egyptian tanks in the Sinai and captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan. Nasser broke diplomatic relations with the U.S. and closed the Suez Canal. The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously for a cease-fire. Among the warring nations of Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Israel, Jordan alone accepted it. Six Israeli demolition team divers were captured in Port Alexandria. Syria shelled a number of communities on Israel's northern border.<br /><br />Into this active war zone sailed the Liberty, not knowing that on June 7, the NSA and Joint Chiefs of Staff had ordered the ship to withdraw 100 miles off the Sinai coast. The orders had been cabled--but all five messages were sent via the Philippines and arrived the day after the attack.<br /><br />Cristol spells out precisely how and why the Liberty was mistaken. The attack was not pre-planned or covered up. None of the seamen aboard the USS Liberty could have known all the facts surrounding the case.<br /><br />He also shows that, had Israel and the U.S. played up their extensive investigations, they could have long since silenced false charges of a conspiracy and cover-up.<br /><br />For all reasonable human beings, this superb piece of investigative reportage and scholarship should resolve the myriad mysteries of this sad event once and for all.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

Sometimes it sailed out of a cloud, rose from behind tall buildings or peeked from behind the branches of a tree. And once it rose out of the sea.<br /><br />But wherever the new moon came from, it brought the Jewish holidays, and the sisters greeted it with \\"Shalom aleichem!\\" (Peace welcome!)<br /><br />The book's beginning and its end, unfortunately, are much brighter than the middle.<br /><br />There are certainly some other highlights in these Jewish stories, but as a whole, they have not aged well. In the third, for example, the main character is Dvorah Bee, who lived in a hive with her aunts and cousins and wanted to make honey. She flies out and meets a sick flower. The dialogue is as saccharin as the concept. Devorah alighted on a pink petunia. \\"Good morning, Flower,\\" she said. \\"Good morning Bee.\\"<br /><br />And so on. The whole point of this ridiculousness is to make honey for Debbie and Ruthie's Rosh Hashonah. Oy.<br /><br />In the fourth more realistic tale, albeit still somewhat dated, Ruth and Debbie argued and, in the spirit of Yom Kippur, made up.<br /><br />For Sukkot, Ruthie and Debbie meet some new friends and invite them to build a Sukkah and join them there fore a meal. There's a story for Simchat Torah, four for Shabbat, one for Hanukkah, one for Tu'BeShevat (birthday of the trees), one for Purim, two for Pessach, two for Lag Ba'Omer and (including one about Rabbi Simon bar Yochai, who lived in ancient Israel) and one for Shavuot.<br /><br />But while these stories all convey central Jewish ideas, they are dated and not nearly as compelling as Weilerstein's better-known K'tonton tales.<br /><br />If you had these stories as a child, perhaps you will appreciate them.

We picked up our copy on a visit a few years ago to the U.S. steam railroad national park in Scranton, Pennsylvania. There a woman curator acted the part of Rosie, providing riveting details from the life of a World War II female railroad worker. The children loved it and insisted on getting this volume.<br /><br />The steam railroads began to take hold of the U.S. travel market in the 1930s, when people called them Iron Horses. The first three-page chapter describes the process by which trains replaced the horse and stagecoach and began to haul laws, raw materials and farm produce across the U.S. The railroads employed engineers, conductors, brakemen, firemen, station agents, dispatchers and many others to keep them running, not to mention the legions who worked to build thousands of miles of track.<br /><br />Most were men, but beginning in 1838, a handful of Native American and black women (the latter, freed slaves) began to work in domestic service jobs for the railroads. They also served water and sold fruit to women traveling in the ladies' cars. In 1855, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad hired Bridget Doheny, Catherine Shirley and Susan Morningstar as charwomen to clean the Camden, N.J. depot. In 1870, the Hartford & New Haven line hired a Mrs. T. Hatch to care for the Newington station for 75 cents a day.<br /><br />In the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s, women began working as telegraphers, known in the business as brass pounders. Women like Ella Campbell communicated by Morse code with brass telegraph keys, determining which trains had rights of way, often preventing accidents. Boiler explosions, blizzards, coupling cars and runaway trains caused accidents and deaths. But hundreds more would have occurred annually without the women who worked in train traffic control. Women also served as ticket sellers and train dispatchers. By 1900 they worked as clerks.<br /><br />Sarah Clark Kidder became the first woman president of a railroad in 1900 and Mary Pennington designed an improved refrigeration car and worked several years to convince railroad executives to use them. Mary Colter was an architect, who designed the Harvey chain of restaurants for the length of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa & Fe. Still others manned the chain as Harvey's girls.<br /><br />But the largest influx of women into the railroad workforces occurred during the two World Wars. With men recruited to fight in Europe, the U.S. labor market turned to women to fill their jobs. Thousands of women flooded key railroad jobs--as towermen, yardmasters, drawbridge tenders, steam-hammer and turntable operators, welders, brakemen, freight handlers--and riveters.<br /><br />During World War I, women worked a 48-hour week for as much as $95 a month, although they were often paid something less as \\"helpers.\\" But they experienced strong patriotism and pride in their work, laboring both in their work and against discrimination and harassment, which was particularly strong against women of color.

Once again the women made the U.S. victory trains run.    The last chapter of this fine read discusses the past, the present and the future for American railroading women. Alyssa A. Lappen	2002-06-29

As head of the Miami chapter of the U.S. National Audubon Society, Browder felt that his only chance to stop the destructive development in the swamp would be to gain support from others. He convinced both old-time alligator hunter Gator Bill and Miccosukee chief Buffalo Tiger to join his fight.<br /><br />Next Browder drafted Marjory Stoneman Douglas. Douglas had written her legendary book, River of Grass, in 1947. He drove her to the site of the jetport, where some trees had already been cut and the swamp drained. She decided then and there to help. The people of Florida could have a jetport or the Everglades, but they couldn't have both. The former, if constructed, would destroy the latter.<br /><br />Douglas formed the Friends of the Everglades and took the fight to Washington D.C. and then Interior Secretary Walter Hickel and Secretary of Transportation John Volpe. They ordered an environmental study, which found that the jetport would so pollute the Glades' water, its lifeblood, that all wildlife there would be threatened.<br /><br />At last, Joe Browder too made it to Washington, where he met with President Richard Nixon. Transportation Secretary Volpe supported the jetport, while Interior Secretary Hickel opposed it. Nixon sent his daughter Julie to Florida to see the Everglades. When she returned to Washington, she told her the President that the Everglades were a national treasure. Nixon called a press conference and opposed the jetport.<br /><br />This is a great book for children, which shows what can one person can accomplish if only he tries. And of course, it extols the virtues of one of the most beautiful places on Earth. Alyssa A. Lappen	2002-06-29

Along with downsizing, cost cutting and concerns for shareholder value, come certain malaise. Hamill disparages today's \\"tabloid\\" journalists, but his complaint covers the entire news corps just as well. I learned recently that one major news magazine now determines whether or not to report a story based on its research costs per page of the expected count. Since the best stories always cost most to produce, this system ensures that the best stories will not be written.<br /><br />Good old tabloid reporters, he avows, would be appalled at the slovenly way the word \\"tabloid\\" is thrown around and at most current practices --- what I call \\"state-of-the-art.\\" Old-timers didn't pay streetwalkers for stories, he notes, or \\"sniff around the private lives of politicians like agents from the vice squad.\\" On breaking news, they did not \\"behave like a writhing, snarling, mindless centipede, all legs and Leicas,\\" but rather \\"found ways to get the story without behaving like thugs or louts.\\"<br /><br />Old-timers also believed what too many newspaper reporters and publishers have forgotten --- that they should act as ombudsmen for the public (my term). They have instead traded that role for consumerism, denying fundamental responsibilities to instead give readers entertainment, \\"what publishers, in their omniscience, think those readers want.\\"<br /><br />Without healthy newspapers, Hamill understands, no democracy can function and evolve. He reminds us that 65 reporters died in Indochina to bring us the truth, that reporters have continued to die in wars ever since --- in Lebanon, Nicaragua, Bosnia and Peru --- \\"and a lot of other places where hard rain falls.\\" The total is now higher --- of course, including 8 reporters in Afghanistan, and Daniel Pearl, murdered in Pakistan because he was Jewish.<br /><br />But Internet and television relentlessly pull readers away. From 1970 through 1990, U.S. newspaper circulation remained roughly static at 60 million.<br /><br />One result is a decline in quality of which the reporters, editors and publishers are all too aware. Another is that newspapers start to lose money and die. A third is the promotion of self, celebrity journalism. Newspapers today peddle \\"the same obsession with big names\\" as everyone else. I couldn't agree more. Witness the celebrity television and movie stars hired as news anchors by CNN.<br /><br />Finally comes the loss of reportorial humility. Hamill writes that few reporters are today like David Remnick of the New Yorker, remaining properly humble. Those rare souls \\"are uninterested in working as hangmen,\\" because their sense of proportion prohibits it. They know they cannot reach as deeply into the secret places of the heart as great fiction. \\"People lie to themselves as well as others,\\" Hamill writes. \\"The journalist is always a prisoner of what he or she is told. The truth is always elusive.\\" Without humility, reporters actually believe they can hit the ever-illusive bull's eye.<br /><br />But the largest casualty is the deflation of journalism's key currency --- truth itself. It is defeated by conditions best described in George Orwell's fiction, conditions that have become reality. To reporters today, murderers are not killers, but activists, and terrorism is a cause celebre.<br /><br />Hamill correctly savages newspapers and their current culture. \\"Trust is the heart of the matter,\\" he writes.<br /><br />Too bad more editors and reporters don't trust the mass of readers with the good sense to tell them that they have the most critical story wrong. They trip themselves up on old-fashioned hubris.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A. Lappenntlessly pull readers away. From 1970 through 1990, U.S. newspaper circulation remained roughly static at 60 million.

The town was so small that when Roshana the wigmaker sneezed, Mishkin the tailor said &#34;God bless you,&#34; though he lived a dozen doors away.<br /><br />One day Mendel put a sign in his window that his butcher shop was for rent. The townsfolk worried that Mendel and Molly were moving, or worse, sick. On learning that their neighbors were staying, and would rent only half their shop, they hugged one another in relief.<br /><br />Oddly enough someone actually came to rent it. Tinker's name should have warned Mendel that something was amiss with his new tenant, and his business--thinking--should have set off alarm bells. But since Tinker paid a week's rent in advance, Mendel thought nothing of it. Molly was off visiting cousins in Glitnik. Mendel burst in on Simka to share the joyous news.<br /><br />The shop was divided in two by old bed sheets down the middle. Mendel did his week's counting in a whisper. But Tinker, treating Mendel like an old friend, convinced him to sing out his counting. Tinker very shortly knew how many zlotys were in Mendel's box--and through a hole in the sheets--could see the shelf where Mendel kept it.<br /><br />Tinker borrowed Mendel's horse that weekend and promised to return on Monday. He returned--but with three horses and two policemen--and accused Mendel of stealing his money, by naming the exact sum in Mendel's box.<br /><br />Simka quickly came to the rescue, and whispered something to the policemen, who discovered that the whole town knew both the sum in Mendel's box and where he kept it.<br /><br />Then Molly presented Tinker the thinker with a riddle and a pot full of boiling water. How did that help? Hmmmm. Only the people in Kosnov know that secret, and they live in this charming book.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A. Lappen/><br />--- Alyssa A. Lappen	2002-06-05

At odds with the royal court, Elijah denounced idol worship, admonished the people to believe in the One God and was forced to hide and travel from place to place.<br /><br />Once, during a drought, the people Israel gathered at Mount Carmel, where Elijah challenged them to prove the existence of their gods. They prepared an altar and sacrifice to the Canaanite-Phoenician weather god Baal, and prayed for a fire to consume them. Nothing happened. Elijah, in turn, called upon the Holy One. A great fire descended, consumed his offering and ended the drought. Elijah did not die, but rose from the River Jordan in fiery horse-drawn chariot to Heaven, where he records deeds of the righteous, awaiting the time he can help establish peace on earth. We invoke his presence at life cycle events, on Saturday evenings, and at Pessach.<br /><br />The stories that follow these two eloquent introductions exude kindness. In the first, Elijah appeared one day as Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi opened his eyes after praying. Though a great scholar, teacher and rabbi, he could not answer why some people suffer when they have done good deeds and why some wicked people are sometimes rewarded. Elijah agreed to take Rabbi Levi on his travels, provided he questioned nothing. Rabbi Levi agreed.<br /><br />In one town, a poor farmer and his wife offered Elijah and Rabbi Levi a place to sleep and the butter, milk and cheese produced by their only cow. In the morning, Elijah prayed for the cow's death, which soon collapsed and died. The next night, they came to the home of a wealthy man, who grudgingly told them to sleep outside. In the morning, Elijah prayed for the man's wall to be rebuilt, which was done as if by unseen hands.<br /><br />In another town, the worshipers at a fine gold- and silver-filled sanctuary gave the travelers a few pennies to buy water and bread and left them to stay in a room in the shul. Elijah prayed for the congregation to have many leaders. In a fourth town, members of a simple synagogue warmly welcomed the travelers and fed and lodged them in comfort. Elijah prayed for them to have a single leader.<br /><br />Finally Rabbi Levi could stand his pain no longer. How could Elijah pray for suffering for the poor and rewards for the wicked?<br /><br />Elijah answered: The wife of the poor man was ordained to die that day, so he prayed for the cow to die in her place. The rich man's crumbling wall hid a treasure, which would have been found had it collapsed, so he prayed for it to be repaired. A congregation with many leaders would be troubled, while one with one strong leader would prosper, so Elijah prayed for the worshipers to be rewarded according to their goodness or lack thereof. And then Elijah disappeared.<br /><br />The seven other tales similarly teach children to follow Elijah's good example. On hearing each one, children pray for more. And goodness naturally follows.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

They will treasure the book always, because, as Singer noted in the Foreword to this 1966 volume, \\"In stories time does not vanish. Neither do men and animals. For the writer and his readers the creatures go on living forever. What happened a long time ago is still present.\\" Singer dedicated the stories to \\"children who had no chance to grow up because of stupid wars and cruel persecutions\\" and hoped readers would grow into men and women who \\"love not only their own children but all good children everywhere.\\" It's hard to imagine otherwise.<br /><br />The book opens with a tale called \\"Fool's Paradise,\\" in which Atzel, the son of Kadish grew up with an unheard of disease: He thought himself dead. Lazy by nature, he did nothing at all. His parents tried everything, and finally consulted Dr. Yoetz. After telling his parents to prepare a darkened room to look like paradise, with white satin sheets, the good physician came to examine the young man and pronounced him \\"dead.\\"<br /><br />Delighted with this outcome, Atzel regained his appetite and energy, and remained animated until the next day. When exactly the same food was brought to him a winged angel told him, \\"In paradise, my lord, one always eats the same food.\\" On asking the time of day, he was told \\"In paradise there is neither day nor night.\\"<br /><br />Atzel could not meet with anyone, do anything, see his parents or his beloved, whom he was told was mourning him but would meet another young man and marry him instead. \\"That's how it is with the living.\\" After eight days, Atzel began to see the value of living. He would rather chop wood and carry stones than stay in paradise, and would rather kill himself than stay there forever. At that point, Dr. Yoetz told Atzel he was not dead after all. Upon returning to the land of the living, Atzel married his beloved and became one of the most industrious and productive souls in the region. (Many souls now seeking paradise could benefit from this story.)<br /><br />Not all Singer's fools lived in paradise. Some lived in Chelm, the village of idiots young and old. When it snowed on Hanukkah once, all of Chelm glittered like a silver tablecloth. The moon shone; the stars twinkled; the snow shimmered like pearls and diamonds. And the Elders of Chelm believed that a treasure had fallen from the sky. Rather than trample it, they planned to send a messenger to all the houses to tell the people to stay indoors until the treasure could be harvested. But how could the messenger tell them without himself destroying their riches? Suffice it to say the Chelmnicks ended no richer than they began, but for the laughter they provided to outsiders peering in through Singer's window.<br /><br />My favorite story, though, is not funny at all. In Zlateh the Goat, the last and title tale, Rueven instructed his son Aaron to take his pet to the butcher to pay for the struggling family's Hanukkah celebrations. Heartbroken, the boy nevertheless heeded his father and set out, only to be overtaken by a snowstorm. I cannot tell what happened, except to say that the tale warms hearts to the core.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A. Lappenking paradise could benefit from this story.)

She traveled back across centuries, beyond the Silk Route, to places Marco Polo never mentioned. She \\"crossed paths with foxes and ghosts, trained eels and dragons, musicians and jugglers, young lovers and bandits\\" --- traveling as they did, on foot and by taxi, by river sampan, sedan chair, and camel caravan. Sometimes, she hobbled on feet that were bound. And her one aim, she writes, was for the pleasure of the stories.<br /><br />The stories are quite unusual. Some are silly, including the \\"Two-Parasol Person,\\" which tells of a woman who always carried two parasols because her mother told her to do it.<br /><br />Others are fanciful. In \\"Rope Tricks,\\" a magician sent his son into the clouds to pick a peach for the emperor. \\"A Case Against Napping\\" tells of the philosopher Zhuangzi, born in 369 B.C.E., who was once a butterfly. In \\"The Rescue of a Concubine,\\" Dayan saved his lover Amina with live eels, which knotted their bodies together and formed a pair of huge stilts he could climb to scale the walls of the concubines' courtyard. Fireflies lit their way. The captured lovers enchanted their tormentors in ways most exotic and strange.<br /><br />Aside from the stories themselves, I best like the book's epigraph, an ancient Chinese saying: \\"There is a time for frowning and a time for laughing. In either case, it is a serious matter.\\"<br /><br />---Alyssa A. Lappen	2002-06-02

For example, at any given moment 2,000 thunderstorms are happening on Earth, which adds up to about 16 million thunderstorms a year. Like fingerprints, each lightning bolt differs from all others. Kids also learn here about Zeus and his mythic temper and Thor, the Viking God of lightning and thunder, who threw hammers at his enemies. Three brief sections discuss Ben Franklin's famous kite-flying experiment, weather forecasting and storm chasers.<br /><br />Kids next learn how clouds form. Clouds can be small or huge, reaching 60,000 feet --- taller than Mount Everest. Thunderstorms require warm air, which explains why many storms occur near the Equator. Indonesia's Java Island typically has thunderstorms on 223 days out of the year. The Southeastern U.S. also gets lots of thunderstorms. Kids also learn in this chapter the three stages of thunderstorms.<br /><br />The third chapter discusses the types of electricity, including the static variety that causes lightning. Kids learn about the various types of lightning --- sheet, ribbon, bead, ball and fork --- as well as what causes thunder. When lightning flashes, the air through which it travels heats up to about 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which quickly causes rapid loud shock waves that make huge booms. There are several types of thunder, too.<br /><br />Chapter 4 discusses what happens when lightning strikes. It includes 10 pages of beautiful photographs.<br /><br />Next kids meet two young survivors of lightning strikes. Chapter 5 also provides several websites that discuss lightning strikes and storm safety. The latter is also covered in Chapter 6.<br /><br />A fine book.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A. Lappen	2002-06-02

But that is this story's only mention of what became of the vast majority of Europe's Jews during World War II.<br /><br />The next page introduces Miriam and her parents, who explained to her that she must hide on a farm until the danger passed. Miriam packed one suitcase including her favorite books. In the countryside filled with tulips, daffodils and hyacinths, Miriam met the boy named Nello with whose family she would live for the next five years. Miriam's parents explained that she would be safe with them because they were not Jewish.<br /><br />Once during her years with the family, Miriam was forced to hide in a cupboard, which had been pre-determined for those times when German soldiers might come. Outside the door, Nello's parents answered the harsh and mean soldiers in soft, gentle voices.<br /><br />When the story ends, it's not clear whether Miriam would ever see her parents again.

There are also exercises and things for children to think about.<br /><br />After pages and puzzles explaining the first commandment, \\"I am the Lord your God,\\" children are provided a page to cut into a pinwheel. The author asks if they can see, feel, touch or hear the air that turns it. They are then asked how this is like God. Similarly, following pages on the second commandment, \\"You shall have no other Gods before me,\\" kids are asked told of an American general who said, \\"My country right or wrong.\\" The book asks them how this general broke the second commandment.<br /><br />The Biblical, Talmudic and classical Jewish legends all expound upon the commandments. From the Talmud, children learn that one must never rejoice another's death, even the death of an enemy. The Israelites sang and danced after the ancient Egyptians drowned in the Red Sea.

It had magnificent palaces, broad avenues, parks and gardens. In their midst wound a tiny street of broken down houses with narrow windows and doorways and roofs that leaked. In the simplest of these lived a holy man named Tobias with his wife Peninah and their three sons and two daughters. Tobias, a scribe, copied Torah scrolls to make his meager living. Tobias suddenly took ill and lost the use of his right hand. He could earn nothing. The family were hungry. His children had no shoes and could not attend school. But Tobias refused the help of others.<br /><br />\\"Even while waiting for miracles, it is good to do something,\\" his wife told him, and after borrowing a coat, sent him out to seek some luck. Tobias came upon a stranger, and mysteriously regained use of his hand to grasp the man's hand in greeting. The man introduced himself as Elijah and ordered Tobias to take him to the market and sell him as a slave. Tobias refused, calling himself Elijah's slave, but as Elijah was a messenger from God, Tobias had no choice but to heed him.<br /><br />What do you suppose happened next? I cannot tell you. But the story honors Elijah's good name.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A. Lappen	2002-05-25

Six pages are devoted to the Passover story itself--of how, more than 3,000 years ago, Egypt's ancient Pharaoh enslaved the Jewish, God brought ten plagues upon them and Moses led them forth to freedom and into the promised land.<br /><br />Several pages are also devoted to how Passover is celebrated today.<br /><br />The only weakness is that the text is dry.

That question. Only this time it was worse, because of what Sandy Goldstein had done.\\" Sandy's family had put up a Christmas tree and called it a Chanukah bush.<br /><br />This nub of the first pages in this 9-chapter, 48-page easy reader captures the conflicted feelings of Robin, the main Jewish character whose best friend Heather was Christian. Heather naturally wanted Robin to share the joy of Christmas. Robin wanted to share it too. But of course, being Jewish, her family did not have a Christmas tree, and she had to tell her friend, \\"There is no such thing as a Chanukah bush.\\"<br /><br />Things got worse in school, when Robin's teacher directed the children to construct holiday decorations and Sandy Goldstein sat next to Robin, making the ugliest paper chains she had ever seen. Then all the other children started talking about their tree decorations and Santa Claus. Robin felt so, so, left out.<br /><br />At home, Robin had a conversation with her mother about different ways of being Jewish. Robin's mother finished by saying that if Sandy Goldstein's family had a Christmas tree that was their business, but she would not have one in her house. They lit Chanukah candles.<br /><br />Then Robin's Grandpa entered. His union was holding a Christmas party and he wanted Robin to go. The story travels through another five chapters and 28 pages before the girls reach an understanding about one another and their holidays. And that understanding is truly magnificent.<br /><br />This book shows children the respect that they can and should have for others of varied faiths. Children (and people) can be different, but nevertheless help and love one another, deeply.<br /><br />And PS, this book is not just for girls. Our copy was a gift from a relative whose son loved the story too.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A. Lappen	2002-05-25

As the story opens, Beni and Sara came home from school to find a letter from their grandparents announcing that they look forward to seeing the children for the holidays, when their cousins Max, Rosie, Goldie Molly and Sam would also visit.<br /><br />Later during the week, the children colored Rosh Hashonah cards for their cousins and their friends Leo and Blossom. The morning before Rosh Hashonah, their Papa packed the car while Mama wrapped special cakes and cookies that Beni and Sara had helped to prepare. They couldn't wait to eat all that Rugelach, Mandelbrot and Strudel.<br /><br />They arrived at their grandparents with hugs and kisses, as always, but as Grandma lit the Holiday candles and said the blessings, Cousin Max tapped Sara on the shoulder and then shot a rubber band at her.<br /><br />Grandpa said the blessings over the wine (Kiddush) and raisin challah (Motzie) and everyone said \\"L'Shanah Tovah!\\" (A good, sweet New Year)<br /><br />The children fought with their cousins over this and that, including the wet plastic spiders that Max put on everyone's pillows. But the next morning after services, when the children beamed as their Papa blew the Shofar announcing the New Year, they thought about the things they had done in the previous year. In the afternoon, they took a walk to say Tashlich. They threw bits of bread into the brook, to get rid of their mistakes and start fresh. \\"This is for teasing Sara, and Beni,\\" Max said as he tossed his bread away. And he said sorry to his cousins.<br /><br />In the next and last five pages, the children learned the true meaning of Rosh Hashonah.<br /><br />The book includes a two-page recipe for raisin challah and a glossary of transliterated Jewish and High Holiday terms.<br /><br />A very cute story, but you're better off with Beni's Family Treasury: Stories for the Jewish Holidays, which includes stories for Sukkot, Chanukah, Purim and Passover as well.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

No question, children make fine listeners as well, particularly to these eight stories, which include several Singer originals, as well as some he heard from his mother, who heard them from her mother and grandmother.<br /><br />Whatever their etymology, the stories all exhibit the themes that run throughout Singer's body of work--spirit, life and the supernatural--all encased in an amazingly agile use of language and humor that glints at the edges.<br /><br />The book opens with the tale of \\"Shrewd Todie and Lyzer the Miser.\\" The former had a wife Shaindel and seven children and never earned enough to feed them. He had such poor luck working at trades that he decided if he should make candles, the sun would never set. During an especially cold winter, Shaindel told Todie that if he could not get something to eat, she would go to the Rabbi and get a divorce. \\"And what will you do with it,\\" he asked her. \\"Eat it?\\"<br /><br />Lyzer, meanwhile, was so stingy that he let his wife bake bread only once every four weeks because stale bread was eaten more slowly than fresh. Rather than feed his goats, he let them feast on the thatched roofs of his neighbors. He preferred to eat his dry bread and borscht on a box so that his upholstered chairs would not wear out. He was not a man to make a loan, preferring to keep his money in his strongbox.<br /><br />But one day Todie asked to Lyzer to borrow a silver spoon, giving his holy word that he would return it the next day. Not one to doubt holy words, Lyzer loaned the spoon and was pleased the next day when Todie returned it, plus a silver teaspoon, explaining that the spoon had given birth. As Todie was honest, he had to return both. He repeated the exercise twice more.<br /><br />At last, he came to Lyzer to borrow some silver candlesticks for Shabbat. Lyzer gladly loaned them. Todie sold the candlesticks, bought his wife and seven children a feast and on Sunday, returned to Lyzer to say that his candlesticks had died. \\"You fool! How can candlesticks die,\\" Lyzer screamed, dragging Todie to the Rabbi. \\"Did you expect candlesticks to give birth?\\" the Rabbi asked. \\"If you accept nonsense that brings you profit, you must also accept nonsense when it brings you loss.\\"<br /><br />Others stories are less silly. We meet Peziza the imp and her friend Tsirtsur the cricket, who lived together in an old stove and shared stories gay, devilish, frightening, and delightful for telling on long winter nights.<br /><br />And Rabbi Leib, who managed to escape the evil works of Cunegunde, a witch whose son Bolvan robbed the merchants on the roads and hoarded his stolen goods in a cave rendered invisible by his mother's evil magic.<br /><br />Still others are sillier. These, not surprisingly, hail from that province of silliness, Chelm. In Singer's Chelm, like all renditions of the town, lived fools. Here, even their monikers are funny--names like Gronam Ox, Dopey Lekisch, Zeinvel Ninny,  Shmendrick Numskull and Feyvel Thickwit.<br /><br />Now Shlemiel of the title also lived in Chelm, and was a businessman, such as it were. He married Mrs. Shlemiel, whose father gave him a dowry, with which he bought a goat in Lublin. But on the way home, he left the goat tethered to a tree while he went into an inn for some brandy, chopped liver and onions and a plate of chicken soup and noodles. The innkeeper (not surprisingly) switched his old blind billy goat for Shlemiel's milking goat. Lots more fun and some Chelmnick wisdom followed.<br /><br />Each good tale wags another. Poverty grew larger, and naturally her feet grew larger too. Menash had a dream, and yes, Shlemiel finally went to Warsaw. To discover the sense in this nonsense, get this book, and share it with your children, be they young or old.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A. Lappen	2002-05-24

The key point is that the Jewish people are always welcome in Israel, their only homeland.<br />While the land of Israel is old, the book explains that the state of Israel is very young, having been born in 1948. Kids are asked on the next pages to find out how old Israel is and color in the state's birthday cake.<br />The book includes an Israeli flag, which kids will like coloring in blue and white.<br />There are also mazes to the Temple Mount, through an oasis, and a page on Ha Kotel, the Western Wall of the Second Temple.<br />The book explains that people of all kinds live in Israel, and that while the old city of Jerusalem is an ancient Jewish city, it is also important to Christians and Moslems. Kids are asked to draw the arms--and join the hands--of an Arab man, a Christian nun and an Hasidic man. The Jewish people revere peace and friendship.<br />Several pages are devoted to the museums, hospitals, universities, industries and products of Israel, and several more to the key cities of Tel Aviv, Tsfat, Beer Sheva and Eilat.<br />Kids also learn about kibbutzim and archeology.<br />No activity book about Israel would be complete without a map of the state, a Hebrew alphabet (aleph bet) and a few Hebrew words.<br />A great addition to any child's library.

We were hard-pressed to help our child through transition periods during his school day, and at the suggestion of teachers, bought a series of word find books to help. They were great, but the scholastic edition of this volume, a gift from school, is even better.<br /><br />It includes five word-find and crossword-like criss-crossing puzzles, as well as word scramblers, sentence scramblers, suffix puzzles and clued games of hangman--all of which use science as the central theme. So the puzzles both calm the fidgets and teach something, a rare combination in puzzle books.<br /><br />One puzzle includes the names of 24 tropical and temperate-zone trees that kids must place into a crossword gird, thereby learning names as varied as sequoia and cypress, nutmeg and mimosa.<br /><br />Another coded riddle lets children unwind the meanings of a bunch of explanation points, hyphens and stars. The puzzle decodes into a joke: \\"Where do Martians leave their spaceships? At parking meteors!\\"<br /><br />Other puzzles include the names of various creatures (antelope, badger, bobcat, coyote, hamster, leopard, jaguar, shrew, tiger, wildebeest, chimpanzee, gorilla) etc., the planets, cooking ingredients (did you know cooking involves chemistry?) and various kinds of jobs for scientists.<br /><br />Some of the puzzles are a bit too challenging.

On its Main Street are the Laundry, Bakery, Pizza Parlor, Telephone Company, Library, Courthouse (with statues of Cayuga Ridge heroes) and the Cayuga Ridge Gravity Company, after which this darling volume is named.<br /><br />At the Gravity Company, Mortimer ensures that the machine always works. He watches its dials, gauges, switches, levers, and buttons--and thus sees to it that the folks in Cayuga Ridge have enough gravity. But every afternoon, when Mortimer goes out to lunch, he puts the gravity machine on automatic. And while he's out, Gloria comes in to clean, with her mops, buckets, rags and soap.<br /><br />But on one special (or infamous) day, depending on whether readers are up or down, Gloria was cleaning the Gravity Company with all those mops, brooms, brushes, buckets and soaps. Her mop hit the automatic switch, turning the machine off. All over Cayuga Ridge funny things started to happen.<br /><br />I won't spoil 24 pages describing the drama that followed--or how Mortimer came to the hapless town's rescue--but children learn from these hysterical antics all about gravity and why it is so important to Earth.<br /><br />Our copy of this 1988 classic is falling apart. I'd stop before calling the book priceless, though, as even Gravity has its limits.<br /><br />---Alyssa A. Lappen	2002-05-11

In fact, they might be better off not knowing. England's poet laureate drove two wives to suicide--Sylvia Plath and, six years later, Assia Welville, who also murdered her child.<br /><br />Readers need know nothing about the Cold War, either, though Hughes clearly created this story as an allegory about the evil of war. He gave the characters very little development. Hogarth, the boy who centers the movie based very loosely on this book, functions as a sort of trigger. But there's not much explanation about why he acts, or why anyone acts, for that matter.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the plot will draw even the most tortured second-grade reader into its tangle of fantasy, words and poetry. And once there, he will find it impossible to escape until the book is done. (My favorite part is the music of the spheres--the music that space made, a strange soft music, deep and weird, like millions of voices singing together.)<br /><br />The Iron Giant came to the top of a cliff one night, no one knows how or from where he had come. The wind sang through his iron fingers, and his great iron head, shaped like a dustbin but big as a bedroom, slowly turned right, then slowly turned left. Down the cliff he fell, his iron legs, arms and ears breaking loose and falling off as he went. The pieces scattered, crashed, bumped, clanged down onto the rocky beach far below, where the sound of the sea chewed away at it, and the pieces of the Iron Giant lay scattered far and wide, silent and unmoving.<br /><br />See what I mean? When the Giant was discovered after biting a tractor in two, the farmers whose equipment he had ruined dug a deep enormous hole, a stupendous hole on the side of which they put a rusty old truck to attract him. Hogarth lured the Giant there, and when he finally came to the trap, the farmers filled it in on top of him and let out a great cheer. Of course, the Giant escaped, and Hogarth (who felt guilty) found a home for him in the local scrap yard, where he could eat tractors to his heart's content.<br /><br />Then arrived from Space a terribly black, terribly scaly, terribly knobbly, terribly horned, terribly hairy, terribly clawed, terribly fanged creature with vast indescribably terrible eyes, each one as big as Switzerland. It landed in Australia, where it covered the whole continent, and all the armies of the world decided to fight this space-bat-angle-dragon, who demanded live creatures as food. They declared war and lost. It was Hogarth's idea to call upon the Iron Giant for help.<br /><br />I won't tell you how the story ended. But the important point, for grown-ups at least, is that in creating his 1968 Cold War space-bat-angle-dragon, the erstwhile pacifist poet Hughes also created a vision of evil incarnate--the kind of evil that wishes to engulf the entire world, that cannot be reasoned with, cannot be pacified and must be fought.

Its seven sections brilliantly cover just about every topic that shaped, affects and changes the plant we live on.<br /><br />The book opens with an 18-page section briefly describing the Planet Earth, beginning with its place and size relative to the Solar System and Universe. A second two-page spread describes how our home looks from outer space, and the mapping of even remote regions for which satellites (among other things) have been employed. Kids will discover the factors that create and change the seasons, as well as the scientific explanations of day and night. Those who joke about digging to China or America (as the case may be), can inspect a cross-section of the Earth's core, learn about its crust and faults (as in earthquake zones) and a bit about the rocks, minerals and fossils scientists have found here. Four more pages explain the earth's  many mineral and metal resources, as well as its fossil and other energy supplies.<br /><br />In a second 18-page section on Earthquakes and Volcanoes, kids discover the intense forces that explode, grow, shift and change the earth. They learn about volcanic hot spots --- especially hot places on the Earth's mantle through which extra-hot magma can shoot up and burn through the Earth's crust to erupt on the surface. They discover the various kinds of lava, and what creates hot springs and rocks. They explore volcanic islands, and view one such place being created and see one of Hawaii's black beaches.  No section on Earth's violent center would be complete without an explanation of the ruin sometimes created by earthquakes, and how they happen --- and this doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />The section on Climate expands to 28 pages, given the vast atmosphere and ground there is to cover.<br /><br />Kids learn about the Earth's atmosphere and its five layers (including of course the threatened ozone layer), its air and ocean currents (including El Nino) as well as the natural carbon and nitrogen cycles that help keep climate in balance.  The book introduces the possibility that global warming and a greenhouse effect may be damaging Earth's weather balance (without concluding definitively that they are). Kids learn about the various climates, including mountain, sea, arctic, tropical, desert and temperate climates, exploring a few pages on types within each group --- from tropical rainforests, grasslands and deserts to polar, mountainous and temperate grasslands.<br /><br />The 16 pages on Weather describe both its importance to life and its formation and more extreme aspects. Kids learn about the water cycle that makes rain, what creates thunderstorms and windstorms (including tornadoes, hurricanes and sea spouts) and why floods and droughts occur and what can happen when they do. The book notes the severe drought that hit the Southern Great Plains of the U.S. from 1931 to 1938, creating the legendary Dust Bowl. It even discusses freaky weather, raining frogs and strange lights (aurora borealis). And for kids who are news junkies, the book tells a bit about weather forecasting --- and why it's sometimes wrong.<br /><br />Another 10 pages briefly describes the myriad forms of life on Earth --- including plants and how they grow, how animals live, and ecosystems and how people affect them. Kids learn about varied kinds of farming --- from giant agribusiness and crop farming to family organic farming.<br /><br />A further section explains how the land is shaped. Kids learn here about soil layers, types of soil and the creatures (like earthworms and slugs) that burrow and enrich it. They also discover the means of protecting the Earth's soil and about the erosion and weathering that can shape and destroy it.<br /><br />Finally a 14-page section teaches kids about the Earth's many water habitats. They learn of rivers and what creatures live there, how they shape the land, and the uses and misuses to which men have put them. They learn about ground water and rivers of ice, and of course about the many seas and oceans as well as the coral reefs, ocean zones, and creatures that fill them.<br /><br />The book closes with a six-page glossary explaining the many terms in the book and brief sections including maps, Earth measures, Earth cycles, lists of Earth sciences, world records and measurements. Kids even get lists of websites where they can learn more. The Scholastic edition of this book is one of the best values in our substantial home library.<br /><br />---Alyssa A. Lappenhave put them.

In this 13 major island archipelago Earth science intersects with animal and natural history.<br /><br />In 45 pages of the most amazing photographs and text, this book tells the story of the islands' formation over 9 million years ago and how their location hundreds of miles from the nearest continent of South America influenced the gradual development of species unique to this locale.<br /><br />Kids learn first about volcanic action (still very much alive here) and they can see its bald shape and effects. They see lava cones and vents, the century-old pahoehoe on Santiago and ashy landforms on Bartolome.<br /><br />Next they learn about the trade winds and sea currents that brought plants and animals to the islands and gradually transformed their landscapes. They meet the famous blue-footed boobies, frigate birds in full expanse, fur seals and sea lions and the marine iguanas found no where else in the world. They see dancing Galapagos tortoises (from which the islands took their name) and their unique land-bound cormorants and penguins, as well as the lush hillsides and unique desert flora, including candelabra and opuntia cacti (the latter being relatives of sunflowers).<br /><br />In these pages, cacti sprout among fresh lava flows.

They ride on a track fashioned of screwdrivers and TV antenna. The decorative details prove equally delightful. The engine's wheels are made of cap guns, rolls of film, batteries, ballpoint pen tops, toy handcuffs and wristwatch and compass faces. The train chugs forward with cotton steam pouring from a thread spool smokestack, and its toy truck, harmonica and nail clipper cowcatcher at the fore.<br /><br />A train station (the next stop) is built of fever thermometers, disposable razors, paint brushes, measuring tape, tennis rackets, silverware holders, an egg slicer and a vegetable steamer. The other scenes include a city-scape, general store, park and zoo, amusement park, sweet shop, hotel and circus.<br /><br />You get the picture.<br /><br />For anyone who can't figure out what's what, the author includes a seven-page appendix describing the type and number of trinkets with which she filled each scene.<br /><br />This book provides endless fun.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

He was the only boy in his village who could not see, but that did not stop him from making mischief, as boys will do.<br /><br />He behaved well in school, but grew bored when the others practiced their writing; that was when he pulled a frog from his pocket and let it loose to revel in hearing the teacher, Reb Shimmel, jump up and down and dance around the frog.<br /><br />He caught his frogs at the river, his favorite place in the town. There he had frogs, water, and friends--and mud to play in besides, He loved building tunnels and mountains in the smooth cool mud, and often came home dirty.<br /><br />His mother Basha would scold him for getting so dirty, for it made more work on top of all she had to do to keep them clothed and fed since Hershel's father had died.<br /><br />This year when Purim came, he wanted more than anything to help his mother make the Hamantashen --- shaped like Haman's hat --- the cakes that they would carry from house to house as sweet gifts to remember the joyful victory of good over evil so long ago in Shushan.

She had his dimples, his curly hair and his curiosity. She gave him her first smile, and as Molly grew, she and Grandpa grew closer. He took her to parks, taught her to sail a boat, made pink lemonade for her. The liked a lot of the same things--mushed ice cream, wildflowers, walks in the woods--and disliked the same things.<br />Grandpa once explained to Molly what happened to a butterfly that died. \\"He won't ever fly or move again,\\" he told her, though it was nice to remember how he was when he was alive.<br />Grandpa promised to take Molly sailing in a real boat the next day, but when Molly awoke, Grandpa didn't feel well. He went to the hospital, and did not get well. He got sicker. He died.<br />In the next 12 pages, as Molly's parents told her that Grandpa died, took her to the funeral. Molly felt Grandpa's death was not fair. She could not cry. She missed him all the time. \\"Tears help you let out your sad feelings and then you can begin to feel better,\\" her mother told her. Molly slowly adjusted in ways I will not reveal.<br />This book can help children heal. I have used it more than once to help our children overcome the deaths of people close to them. It is extremely helpful, and I strongly recommend it. Alyssa A. Lappen	2002-04-28

Mama opened the door and smiled. \\"A guest is always welcome,\\" she said, and welcomed him in as they lit the first candle.<br /><br />Samuel looked forward to making potato latkes, but immediately, Grandma Yetta and Grandma Sophie began to argue about whose recipe they would use.<br /><br />\\"Who needs recipes,\\" he told them. \\"I'll show you how to make potato pancakes from a crust of bread. Some say for potato pancakes a pickle, a fish or a cabbage is good, but I say a crust of bread is best.\\"<br /><br />Of course, Samuel did not really use a crust of bread to make latkes, but in this variation on Stone Soup, he managed to get everyone in the large family to work together on the cooking.<br /><br />He saw a chicken on the window ledge and wondered aloud what it was trying to tell him. \\"I know,\\" said Rachel. \\"The chicken is telling you to add eggs.\\" He agreed and added six eggs, while the Grandma Sophie and Grandma Yetta clucked about his taking advice from chickens.<br /><br />And so the story goes, with many more twists and turns in the recipe--and several other disputes amicably resolved by the clever peddler. The family ended the first night of Hanukkah predictably with a delightful Potato Latke feast.<br /><br />The next morning everyone begged Samuel to stay for the entire eight nights of Hanukkah. But he was off to show other families how to make pancakes from a crust of bread.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A. Lappen	2002-04-28

He was sent for water and by accident, droped his dreidel into the well. Like the boy in Freya Littledale's Peter and the North Wind, another rendition of \\"The Tablecloth, the Donkey, and the Stick,\\" Jacob met a magician, in this case a mischievous goblin who lived in the well and gave him a magic dreidel that spun out potato latkes.<br /><br />Like Peter, Jacob also met a jealous old thief--here, the archetypal Fruma Sarah--who tricked him into giving her the dreidel. When he got home and told his mother the wonderful tale, his dreidel naturally no longer spun magic. Jacob returned to the well three times, each time receiving magic gifts from the friendly goblin. How he finally dealt with Fruma Sarah I cannot tell. But readers large and small will finish this book as joyfully as all the characters in it, including Fruma Sarah.<br /><br />The illustrations, including a goat and various other floating creatures and objects, spin magic evocative of Chagall's eastern European blue.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

Each page describes one creature or plant in 250 to 400 words of large, inviting sans-serif type, accompanied by wonderful black and white pen and ink drawings.<br /><br />Our son spends hours reading this book, which is growing bat-eared from his use. Speaking of which, the book opens with a warm treatment of the only flying mammals--whose front legs are modified to wings that differ greatly from those of birds. \\"Most bats eat insects, which they hunt by sonar detection,\\" the author explains. \\"The bat makes high-pitched sounds above the range of human hearing. The sounds echo and return to the bat's sensitive ears, revealing the size, shape and location of nearby objects, including moving prey.\\"<br /><br />Kochanoff devotes two pages to beavers--one explaining why these delightful animals are commonly described as \\"busy\\" and another detailing the beaver's dam, complete with a cross-section of a home with entrance, air-opening, grooming and eating area, underwater food supply and exit. Kids will delight in the large drawing of the beaver's webbed foot. Eleven more pages detail the lives and habits of chipmunks, eastern cottontails, coyotes, white-tailed deer, red fox, mice and voles, moles, porcupines, raccoon, shrews, striped skunks and grey squirrels.<br /><br />The three pages illustrating the tracks of various animals provide lots more fun. Children also love two pages on other kinds of signs that animals leave behind them--by nibbling on trees, acorns and plants, dropping seeds and conifers parts, or digging teeth marks and chiseling holes. There's something cozy as well about the ways in which diverse species--from bears and woodchucks to turtles, fish and bees--are shown curled or otherwise ensconced in their winter habitats.<br /><br />The section on birds is also fabulous. It provides information on 10 species of birds--from the black-capped chickadee and common crow to the herring gull, hummingbird and killdeer. But kids also love the pages on owl pellets--which shows both the birds' droppings and illustrations of the kinds of bones that can be found by carefully picking them apart. An equally fascinating two-page spread shows ground, hanging, chimney, mud, tree and cupped nests.<br /><br />And what would a nature book be without frogs, earthworms and bugs? In this book, children will get their fill, with 40 pages of fun. I'm not sure which is better, the drawings of the frogs and insects or the handsome illustrations of the wasps nests, empty bumblebee cocoons, honeycombs, butterfly chrysalis and the webs and nets woven by caddis flies and spiders to gather their food.<br /><br />For plant-lovers there are another 30 pages on 39 different varieties of --as they say in the word game--vegetable matter. That includes 10 types of berries on a three-page spread under that sub-heading. Bet you didn't know wintergreen was a berry. I didn't. And did you ever hear of serviceberries?

This book provides an unvarnished glimpse at the pain of New York City, the blood and guts of September 11. There's nothing artistic or beautiful here--unless one considers the bounteous love delivered by firemen and women, policemen and women and emergency volunteers.<br />The Talmud teaches, &quot;He who saves one life saves an entire world.&quot; New York City's Finest and Bravest lost 366 of their ranks on September 11 2001. The miracle: Their legions saved 25,000 worlds before two avalanches of dust and heat and ash cascaded into stories of smoldering twisted steel.<br />No book can fully expose New York City's still gaping wounds. But this one opens the window on that pain, in a manner deeply respectful of those for whom saving 25,000 worlds cost so many of their own. The names of all these fallen heroes are included.

She introduced the tiny character named K'tonton in the September 1930 issue of Outlook magazine.<br /><br />The Adventures of K'tonton (1935) was printed at least 10 times (we own the 10th edition). K'tonton in Israel appeared in 1964 as a sequel and was in turn followed by K'tonton on and Island in the Sea (1976) and K'tonton in the Circus in 1981. I recently ordered the last, expecting a picture-book with one Hanukkah story. Low and behold, this 86-page volume contains 15 delightful K'tonton tales.<br /><br />The book opens with a brief obligatory reintroduction of the magical little main character: Isaac Samuel ben Baruch Reuben's first name meant laughter, but his parents called him K'tonton --- Hebrew for very very little --- on account of his four-inch height. He was raised on milk with honey added from the land of Israel, and by age three could recite verses from Torah the way other children say nursery rhymes. As in all K'tonton volumes, each tale is filled with details of important Jewish ideas or traditions, and a dash of Jewish humor.<br /><br />Here, as the title implies, K'tonton joined the circus. He had traveled from Brooklyn to South Carolina to visit his aunt. In her yard, K'tonton sat under her fig tree. Its vine reminded him of the biblical verse, \\"Nations shall beat their swords into plowshares, their spears into pruning hooks.\\" All that day, he dreamed of the Messiah, and the next day, the first day of Kislev, his father tucked him into his pocket to go to synagogue.<br /><br />After services, he sat on the window sill thinking of Elijah the prophet while his father talked to the Rabbi. He was singing softly, Am Yisrael Chai (The people Israel lives) when the sound of a trumpet rang, and a tall bearded man in a cape rode by on a bicycle. \\"Elijah, Elijah, you've come!\\" K'tonton shouted. Needless to say, the bike rider was not Elijah at all, but a circus man who brought K'tonton not to Jerusalem, as the Jewish Tom Thumb had expected, but in a circus tent.<br /><br />Before long, K'tonton found himself at work as a main attraction in the Sideshow tent, where he met the Wild Man of Borneo and a Sword Swallower, who could not beat his sword into a plowshare, lest he lose his job. In another story, K'tonton met Mama Belle, Lillibelle and Papa Joe, a family of acrobats who cleared a small nook for him in their cramped trailer. When they saw he wasn't eating, and he explained that he must keep kosher, they found him bread, popcorn, boiled eggs and tuna.<br /><br />In the fifth story, K'tonton visited the lion's cage --- giving a kindergarten class visiting that day a major fright. The circus master warned him to be careful around animals that were once wild. To this, K'tonton objected fiercely. \\"When the Messiah comes,\\" he said knowingly, \\"the lambs will lie down with the lions.\\" Well, the master agreed, he could go into the cage again --- but only after the Messiah came.<br /><br />In the next story, Daisy, the Fat Lady, threatened to go on strike and lose most of her 410 pounds if the Big Boss didn't let K'tonton observe the Sabbath. (I won't tell what else happened.)<br /><br />Stories seven, eight, nine and ten introduced K'tonton to the horses and camels, and elephants. K'tonton learned how a seal named Baby came into the circus, which involved a mitzvah--a good deed. K'tonton helped arrange a benefit, another mitzvah. K'tonton met Clarence, a clown who figured he was useless. K'tonton told Clarence about the Prophet Elijah, who had once noted that two clowns could count on going to heaven, since they \\"cause laughter and make sad hearts glad.\\" K'tonton cheered Clarence, but himself grew despondent for reasons I can't reveal.<br /><br />In the 12th story of this book K'tonton finally celebrated Hanukkah. This was even more original than the first Hanukkah celebration, in which he rode a dreidel offthe edge of a table, down a flight or stairs and right into the street. K'tonton explained a thing or two, made some latkes and gave presents. This tale also featured a dreidel, but not the sort you might think.<br /><br />After several more adventures, K'tonton finally made it home to his parents. How? Alas, I must keep that secret too.

She introduced the tiny character named K'tonton in the September 1930 issue of Outlook magazine.<br />The Adventures of K'tonton (1935) included 16 stories and was reprinted at least 10 times. (We own the tenth edition, from 1956). No wonder. Each tale includes important Jewish ideas or traditions, and a dash of Jewish humor--and its own complex plot. A few tales from this volume--Ktonton's Sukkot Adventure and Ktonton's Yom Kippur Kitten--were reprinted later as individual books with new color illustrations.<br />Isaac Samuel ben Baruch Reuben--whose first name meant laughter--was called K'tonton, which in case you wondered, is Hebrew for very very little. He was a late-born miracle for whom his mother had prayed so hard one Sukkot that she promised to love even a child \\"no bigger than a thumb.\\" Sure enough, before a year had passed, she gave birth to a son. And sure enough, he was no bigger than her thumb. She blanketed him in the flax she had used to wrap an etrog--the Israeli citrus fruit used to celebrate Sukkot--and cradled him in a hand-carved etrog box.<br />It was also on the harvest festival of Sukkot that K'tonton made his first trip to the synagogue. As his father put his etrog carefully into its box to take to shul, K'tonton eagerly asked to join him. \\"Next year,\\" answered his father, \\"when you're a little bigger.\\" Like all over-eager boys, K'tonton did something he shouldn't, and climbed inside the etrog box to hide.<br />Once in shul, he couldn't see, so he climbed onto the lulav--the palm branch that is pointed east, west, south and north, to the heavens and to earth as part of the celebration. As K'tonton's father rose with the congregation to chant Hodu l'Adonai ki tov--Praise the Lord for God is good--there was K'tonton singing from atop the lulav, in a high treble that rose above all the other voices.<br />I can't tell all the myriad details, but here's a taste of K'tonton's adventures: He planned a palace for the Sabbath Queen, saved the birds on Shabbat Shirah, planted trees in Israel and sent them a Shanah Tovah (a Happy New Year). In one hilarious tale, a spinning Chanukah dreidel carried K'tonton off the table, down the stairs, out the door, into the street and into a gutter, where he found a small bit of Chanukah money known in Yiddish as gelt.<br />K'tonton also turned up in a Purim cookie, a Hamentash, covered with poppy seeds. On the day before Passover, he helped (with a mouse) find and discard the last crumbs in the house to help celebrate the redemption of the Hebrew slaves. He had a picnic on Lag Ba'Omer, rode an arrow and a bird. The book also features stories for Shevuot, Rosh Hashonah, Yom Kippur (when K'tonton tried to feed a hungry cat), Shemini Atzeret, Simchat Torah and a finale for Sukkot.<br />Each one of these 16 special stories of a tiny boy will light children's eyes.

On Purim, Jewish congregations retell the long happy tale (hence the phrase, the whole Megillah) and often give a Purim spiel, or play. Children attend costumed as Haman, Mordechai or Esther, and jeer and swing their noisemakers each time Haman's name is read.<br /><br />This fun volume includes the Purim story and a play, given by Frannie and her cousins at home. Too bad, the cousin who usually plays Haman has the flu. Frannie's mother has invited Mrs. Teplitzky to take his part.<br /><br />The children expect the worst of their widowed neighbor. But Mrs. Teplitzky arrives festooned in a very multi-colored robe, tri-cornered hat and convincing beard, and admits that she was once an actress. The plot thickens from there.<br /><br />A three-page appendix includes the full tale of Esther, her cousin Mordechai, Ahasueras and of course Haman, a page on how the holiday is celebrated and a recipe for the tri-cornered Purim cookies named Hamantaschen for Haman's hat.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

Anyone who has never before prepared a Seder will find this section extremely useful, for it offers many suggestions to involve the children even before the holiday begins. Children can help decide, for example, who should lead the meal, or themselves prepare to lead parts of the service. They can also help clean the home of Chametz (unleavened bread), make Charoset and prepare the Seder Plate. (The book even suggests substitutes for vegetarian families.)<br /><br />Only 36 pages are devoted to the Seder itself, but they are easy enough for families with little or no Hebrew, and for small children to understand. All blessings--Lighting the Candles, Shecheyanu (Thanking God for life, sustenance and reaching this season), the Kiddush (Blessing of Wine), Dipping of Greens, HaMotzie (Blessing the Matzah), and Blessings over the Bitter Herbs and Charoset--are included in Hebrew and English transliterations. So are the Four Questions. Unfortunately, the recitation of the Ten Plagues is in English, with no Hebrew, transliterated or otherwise.<br /><br />But the book includes Dayenu. In this song, the Jewish people thank God for the miracles that Pessach celebrates --- granting our freedom, bringing us forth from Egypt, dividing the Red Sea, feeding us manna, leading us from the desert, giving us Shabbat, leading us to Mount Sinai, giving us Israel, building the Holy Temple.<br /><br />In addition to Elijah's Cup, this Haggadah also includes Miriam's Cup on the Seder table. This egalitarian addition celebrates the women of the Pessach story --- Moses' mother Yocheved, the midwives Shifrah and Puah, Pharaoh's daughter Thermutis, and Miriam, who watched over Moses, put him in the basket and led our song when we emerged from the Sea of Reeds.<br /><br />Pessach has always been my favorite holiday. This book helps children understand that while Passover celebrates events that happened thousands of years ago, each person must remember them as if he or she was also redeemed from slavery, brought to Mount Sinai, and given the Torah. It infuses the holiday with the immediacy that makes it special.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

Before long he has big plans about how to spend the $35 inside. His sister, though, reminds him that he must try to find the owner. Things grow very complicated indeed when, in response to his ad, not one but two people call about the wallet, which they both describe precisely, along with all its contents. What should he do?<br /><br />All kids have at some time found something that wasn't theirs.<br /><br />The puzzle therefore easily engrosses them and provides a great platform for Jewish philosophy. Kids learn why they must return things, and what to do when for some reason, that's impossible. (Hint: charity is a big ingredient.) The story includes many Jewish terms, and a poem encouraging kids to follow Jewish laws. But it has much to offer even secular families, or those of other faiths, for it shows the joy in treating people well, and acting morally.<br /><br />My son --- who has found his share of things --- identifies with Dovid and adores this special tale.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

It wanders through places they might find seats, including \\"in the attic,/ Or on bookshelves in pairs,\\"... \\"in the sink/ Soaking suds with the pans,\\" camped out \\"in the carport\\" or in \\"empty trash cans.\\"<br />For the Kiddush (blessing the wine) the family will stand, so that's no problem, but the child narrator knows that sitting down for the meal will land \\"half on the floor.\\" He thinks of stacking everyone in one chair, and reading \\"the Haggadah/ Sing songs filled with hope,/ With one book at the bottom/And a long periscope.\\"<br />I won't spoil any of the glorious special effects. Suffice it to say, readers will delight in the book's dipping of greens, funny hiding of matzah and hysterical asking of four questions. (Even Elijah brings a laugh.) Children also love the simple pen and ink drawings that bring this light-heartedness to life. Alyssa A. Lappen	2002-03-29

Do Not Touch.\\"<br /><br />But at last, the sign and the boxes were too much for her, and she took the long skinny box of after-dinner mints, and next broke off a piece of chocolate covered matzoh. She had eaten all but one piece.<br /><br />The seder was very fine that year, but when the time came to open the door to welcome Elijah the prophet, Sarah's father asked the children to search for their Afikomen, they found it, and were rewarded with books. Finally it was time for treats.<br /><br />The last eight pages of this fine 29-page story reveal a secret about Sarah and her family that every Matzoh Mouse needs to hear.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

The great 11th century French teacher answers the question of why, if God made two great lights --- one to rule the day and the other the night --- He made them large and small.<br /><br />God created the moon and sun the same size, Rashi explains. But then the moon objected to being equal in size to the sun. For this lack of humility, God reduced the moon's size and its shine from a blinding light to a soft glow.<br /><br />In this story, two children ask their father why the moon appears smaller and less bright than the sun. Their father, Abba, answers in a lovely rhymed poem that teaches even small children to be happy with what they have, and not to begrudge others their good fortune.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

Sammy's mother explained that each spring, when the Shapiro family cleaned for Passover, the Spiders made a new web. As his mother told him how to spin a web, Sammy was distracted by the squares on the table below.<br />\\"That's called matzah.\\" Mrs. Spider explained that the Shapiros would eat it at their special meal, called a seder, which also featured a big platter with a roasted egg, bone, parsley, charoset and bitter herbs to help them celebrate. Sammy watched Mr. Shapiro hide the afikomen. After the meal, his son Josh would have try to find it to earn a prize.<br />Sammy was simply not interested in making a web. He listened to Josh ask the Four Questions--why was this night different from all other nights? When Josh hunted for the Afikomen, he also found a special present from Sammy Spider.

One day men came and built a fence around the field and watched over the growing wheat. They watered the field, weeded it and waited for the wheat to ripen. The mouse wondered what was so special about this particular wheat.<br /><br />At last the men harvested the ripened wheat, bundled it and loaded it onto a wagon. They worked carefully to keep it dry.<br /><br />The mouse, curious as a cat, decided to find out what was going on. So he jumped on the wagon and rode to the mill, where he found a hole in the door from which he could watch as huge grinding wheels crushed the harvest into fine flour, and poured it into new sacks and loaded them onto another truck.<br /><br />Hidden in the sacks, he rode for a long time aboard the truck to the city, crowded with people, cars and trucks. Here the truck stopped at a place called Goldstein's Matzah Factory, where an inspector checked to see that every sack was completely dry.<br /><br />From a window ledge, he watched as factory workers inside unloaded the sacks, brought in buckets of water and mixed the water and flour and rolled it out into flat sheets punched full of holes.<br /><br />I can't tell you what happened on the last eight pages of this 34-page book. But kids will learn from this cute book how matzah is made, and what exactly makes it kosher for Pessach.<br /><br />As an added plus, they will enjoy the fine pen and ink art.

I love Chelm and all of its residents, who like many people much of the time, take themselves too seriously to see how funny they are.<br /><br />In this simple tale we meet Rabbi Nachman --- not the one from Bratslav, but a fool like all Chelmites, which the illustrations show beautifully. He wore his kipah upside-down (those educated in Chelm lore will immediately recognize his logic from another tale on how Chelmites avoid getting their hats wet in the rain). He also put his breakfast cream in it.<br /><br />But here's my favorite piece of clever silliness. After failing to see a table right in front of his eyes, Mendel traveled through the snow to find one, and having done so began to carry it back to the shul in time to light the menorah. Of course, he got tired, untied the table and put it down. While resting in the forest, he met Rivki and Dovid.<br /><br />The latter told the table, \\"You have four strong legs. If we can walk to the synagogue on two legs, surely you can walk on four.\\"<br /><br />I won't tell you what else happened, but suffice it to say that even the poor Chelmites eventually determined how to light the Chanukah menorah and found a table to put it on.<br /><br />If you and your children like this Chelm story, try Eric Kimmel's eight Chelm stories in [[ASIN:0439329302 The Jar of Fools]], too. Amongst the very best Chelm stories, also, are Solomon Simon's [[ASIN:0874414695 The Wise Men of Helm and Their Merry Tales]] and his [[ASIN:0874414709 More Wise Men of Helm and Their Merry Tales]].

They are all from Central Asia, the former Republics now at the center of the news. In these lands, the people obviously derive much of their entertainment from stories, and these examples twist and turn through 189 pages of fine, magical, and strangely familiar adventures.<br /><br />From Uzbekistan, readers are treated to Three Brothers, a story retold by Sergei Palastrov in which the father of Tonguch-batyr (21), Ortancha-batyr (18) and Kenjdja-batyr (16) passed some wisdom to his boys. \\"I am not rich,\\" he told them as he grew old, \\"and what you inherit after me will not last long.\\"<br /><br />Still, since he raised them in good health, as strong warriors with nothing to fear, he asked them to be honest (so they'd live without qualms), not to brag (so they'd never be ashamed), and not to be lazy (so they'd be happy). \\"For the rest,\\" he told them, \\"it's your own lookout.\\" He sent them off on three horses with food for a week to seek their fortunes.<br /><br />They rode off together the next morning, and that evening divided the night into three watches. On the first watch, Tonguch heard a noise and drew his sword. Moments later, a lion emerged from the brush, and he slew it and returned to the camp with a small trophy from his prey. Ortancha-batyr's watch came second and Kendja-batyr's third.<br /><br />The next night, on Ortancha-batyr's watch, Azhdar-sultan, King of the Snakes, emerged from the thicket and he slew him, just as his brother did the lion. He too returned to the camp with an easily concealed piece of his prey, as if nothing had happened.<br />The third night, the fire went out and Kendja-batyr left his brothers to thwart a band of robbers who intended to steal from the Shah. Before morning he returned to his brothers as if nothing happened, with a whole set of trophies.<br /><br />The next morning, when the brothers came to the town, the Shah asked all strangers to come at once to his palace. The plot takes many detours and includes a tale within a tale. The illustrations by Uzbek artist Javlon Umarbekov are as lavish as the story, in which the young men followed their father's advice and became quite happy.<br /><br />The next two tales hail from Kirghiz.<br /><br />In Which was Biggest (retold by Mikhail Bulatov), readers again meet three brothers, who decided to live separate and apart. But they had only one bull between them, and failing to see how they could divide it, they set off to consult a wise man. The bull was so huge that, although one traveled by its head, one by its side and the last behind it with a stick, they traveled leagues apart. The tale grows quite fanciful, including an eagle larger than the bull, forty doctors who set sail in a man's eye, and a fox so large it was too big to be skinned on both sides. It also includes a riddle, which readers must solve.<br /><br />Clever Ashik (retold by Dmitri Brudnyi) is the tale of a boy orphaned when he was small and taken in as a shepherd by a wealthy bei. The boy saved a frog, who blessed him in thanks with the gift of a magic pebble. To appease a neighboring khan, the boy solved a riddle (very like one in a Jewish folk tale called The Three Riddles) and outwitted him several times more, for which he was paid with a stay in the dungeon. How he got out is quite fantastic. But there the tale does not end. Ashik encountered still more adventures, in which he employed the devices of a fine Baba Yaga tale I know.  This story, too, ends happily.<br /><br />From Tajikistan come two tales--The Greedy Kazi and The Padishah's Daughter and the Young Slave--illustrated by Vladimir Serebrovsky, the chief artist at the Dushanbe's Aini Opera and Ballet Theater. The second tells of a young woman too haughty to consider any of the suitors who courted her. Despairing that he would never find a husband for her, the Padishah journeyed to other towns seeking a wiseman to advise him. At last an old man who wrote fortunes on pebbles told him his daughter would marry a slave. Enraged, the Padishah ordered his slave beheaded. How the slave escaped him is all magic and delight.<br /><br />The book closes with two Turkmen jewels, Yarty-Gulok and A Mountain of Gems, and a Kazakh tale, A bought Dream, handsomely illustrated by Kazakh artist Mendibai Alin.<br /><br />I have read many folk tales, and many collections, and this one (despite its outdated title) is rich indeed.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

Sure, you still have the usual \\"he said,\\" \\"no, she said\\" fights, spats over ownership of toys and games --- and who gets first dibs on the sofa to read their favorite book.<br /><br />But this book addresses the special kind of rivalry that arises between a child who looks like her parents and one who is shorter, more plump and has different hair. The second will one day say, \\"You love her more, because she came from your tummy.\\"<br /><br />Parents don't, of course, love biological children more than their adopted children.

Another lists food festivals. January is Carrot Festival month in Holtville, California, for example, while February hosts California Kiwifruit Day and the annual pancake race between Olney, England and Liberal, Kansas.<br /><br />Events that made candy history will tickle kids with a sweet tooth.

He owned only two cows, and earned a meager living but was nevertheless always willing to help others. His wife, on the other hand, had the sharpest tongue in Wishniak.<br /><br />In early winter one year, when \\"the wind prowled the icy lanes of the village like a starving jackal,\\" many villagers hungered--including the widow Malka and her ailing son Shmuel, Heshy Fenster and his 13 children and the housebound Bubby (grandmother) Rifka and her cat. The kind and ever-generous Moishe left \\"an extra quart of milk here, a pint of thick cream there.\\"<br /><br />The night before Hanukkah, Baila found her money box empty, and blamed her inability to buy eggs, flour and oil to make latkes on Moishe's \\"foolish generosity.\\" That night, to escape her harangue, he slept in the barn.<br /><br />Imagine his surprise when his two cows awoke him and told of a stranger who arrived and departed while Moishe slept, leaving behind him tales of magic and adventure and a special gift buried in the hay --- a black frying pan.<br /><br />When he got home, he told Baila about the night and the gift, which was endowed with a magical property. Of course, she did not believe him, but when Moishe placed the frying pan on the fire, something wonderful happened. (It's a secret.)<br /><br />The next day, unhappy with the turn of events, Baila hid the Hanukkah candles under her bed, sent Moishe to borrow some more and tried to reproduce the magic feat that Moishe had managed. Of course, since Baila's nature was altogether unkind, the magic she brought on herself was unwelcome indeed. (But that's secret, too.)<br /><br />Nowadays, visitors to Wishniak come to see the frying pan, which the Rabbi displays under glass.

The book is intended for an audience of third and fourth graders. And it has something for everyone.<br /><br />Most children wonder about the origins of Halloween. This book offers them just enough of the history to fascinate them and whet their appetites for more, but not so much that they will never want to read history again.<br /><br />Did you know, for example, that the Celtic people, who lived more than 2,000 years ago in France and the British Isles, feared October 31, as the eve of their festival of Samhain, Lord of the Dead? Celtic priests, called Druids, held fire rites at these times, at which they sometimes burned prisoners alive, to punish them and to predict the future. But Samhain was also a joyful festival, marking the death of the old year and the start of a new one. There are also brief sections on the history of fairies, Goblins and Little People. The book relates how the stories of these creatures came into being, and leaves open the possibility that they were real.<br /><br />Barth also offers tasteful sections on the history of witches (whose sabbaths were joyful) and the Horned God, from Biblical times through the Middle Ages.  She touches on the Christian war against the Devil and the witch-hunts of Germany, England and America. Finally, she relates that how the wicas of lore and yore became the respectable costumed revelers of modern-day Halloween.<br /><br />Barth clearly had no intention of writing an exhaustive history.

This fictional tale, rather, recasts the author's post-war meeting with a German veteran of the Battle of Stalingrad who played an accordion and earned his living as a street musician.

These include the Yiddish writer Isaac Loeb Peretz, a Jewish folktale from Afghanistan, the folk legends of Chelm (that mythic town where all the people are fools), Moroccan Jewish folk legends and from the Rabbinic Misdrashim--the stories, parables and legends told to explain or elaborate on passages from the Torah.<br /><br />For Rosh Hashanah, the tale named \\"The Never Ending Song\\" introduces three mythical beasts and monsters. Ziz had shining golden feathers that protected the earth from the hot winds of the south. Behemoth had bones strong as brass, legs as great as iron bars and a tail as strong as a cedar tree.<br /><br />Leviathan was the greatest sea monster that had as many eyes as the year has days and scales that shone brighter than the sun itself. The smaller creatures created by the Holy One were always chased by greater beasts. They met and called upon Ziz, Behemoth and Leviathan to help them. Then in the month of Tammuz, Behemoth stepped from his cave and roared so loudly that the lions stopped in their tracks, earth shook, tigers, wolves, panthers and jaguars trembled in their skins. That road echoed until the months of Av and Elul and then until the autumn month of Tishri. Next the Ziz unfurled her enormous wings and uttered a cry that pierced the clouds in the sky...<br /><br />My favorite tale in this collection is the author's original creation, from a town called Masoret, for the Hebrew word meaning tradition. One day a Magician came to town to offer his wares. When the people were too busy preparing for Sukkot to buy from him, he grew angry and cast a spell that to ensure they would have no more holidays for 40 generations. But the Magician forgot the children, who were in the fields gathering flowers for Sukkot... Every year in Masoret, the children nail the last boards to the Sukkah, and say the blessings over the lulav and etrog.<br /><br />For Yom Kippur, Hanukkah, Purim, Passover and Shabbat, readers will find five other equally delightful tales in this fine volume.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

The 1991 book was such a success that it was reprinted.<br /><br />The first fold-out of a large menorah, explains the key symbol of Chanukah, and its history. In the Temple's sanctuary was a seven-branched, oil-burning menorah that shown day and night until the Temple's desecration by the Greek soldiers of King Antiochus. When Judah Maccabee recaptured the Temple, he found a small container of purified oil, only enough for one day. One of the miracles of Chanukah was that this oil, when lighted, lasted for eight days, which is why this festival also lasts eight days.<br /><br />The second fold-out offers children a sumptuous pop-up of the Temple, but shows the Greeks inside it, feasting and making merry in the Jews' Holiest place.<br /><br />The third pop-up offers a recreation of the battle that Judah Maccabee fought to retake Jerusalem and the Temple.<br /><br />The book also offers pages on the rededication of the Temple and Chanukah around the world, as well as a paper dreidel that kids can put together themselves.<br /><br />This book is a delight.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

He stood on shore with his mother and brother waving goodbye to his father's ship, which would be gone all summer. Willie announced he'd be in charge for that time. Louis, angered, took off on his bike, then crashed.<br /><br />At the bottom of the hill, a blueberry train pulled into the station, and Louis asked his mother if he could ride it alone to Copper Creek to pick berries to sell to Hemplemiers Bakery. He planned to buy long pants with the proceeds.<br /><br />After a night dreaming of dragons, black knights and gloomy dungeons, Louis set off on the train the next day by himself, with a bucket for blueberries and a lunch pail. On board, a woman asked to sit with him, and pretended to feel frightened. Louis was heartened.<br /><br />The train rolled over a wooden bridge, through woods and past farms, finally stopping at Copper Creek. The woods filled with blueberry pickers. At lunchtime he ate with his train companions, but he went back to work by himself.<br /><br />Louis trudged into a far part of the clearing, and began picking. He could feel something watching him.

Including, of course, kids reading this book. When people get angry they do silly things--shake their fists, jump up and down, rant and rave, call bad names, throw things.<br /><br />The book explains anger as the feeling we have when we are really annoyed or really mad. Anger, children learn here, affects their thinking, excites emotions, makes muscles tense. Kids learn why people get angry (it happens more easily when they don't fell well, or are in a grumpy mood, when someone calls a bad name, makes fun, pushes, hits or breaks a favorite toy). People can get mad at themselves, too--because they stub a toe, bump their head, dent their new bike, lose their lunch money or forget their homework. It also happens often--up to 12 times a day.<br /><br />When people are angry, they do funny things. If someone laughs at them, they get angrier, lose control, hit and sometimes become so enraged, they even kill another person. Being so angry can actually make people sick.<br /><br />About halfway through this book, the author notes that in order to become productive and happy, kids should avoid being angry. This section begins with the recognition that anger is often inappropriate. No one would consider it funny, for example, for the President of the U.S. to get so angry that he started screaming and yelling on national television. Feeling angry can be harmful. People who rant and rave get into more fights, are more apt to lie, cheat and steal, drop out of school and get sick or use drugs.<br /><br />It's not good, either, to blame oneself for others' anger. They are responsible for themselves. We are responsible for ourselves. And we can quickly change from feeling okay to feeling angry, which in turn produces physical reactions, including tense muscles. It's like \\"speeding down the highway at one hundred miles per hour\\" in a car without a steering wheel.<br /><br />The book's final 18 pages provide anger-control methods. \\"Before you race out of control,\\" Moser writes, \\"put on the brakes.<br /><br />Give yourself time to calm down by counting to ten slowly. If you still feel upset, keep on counting.\\" Staying calm, the book tells kids, will help them to think more clearly, listen to their thoughts and control their behavior. Reading a joke book can kids laugh, which creates good brain chemicals, which in turn kill pain. The author also advises kids to channel their anger to good uses: draw a picture, write something, clean a room, wash dishes, straighten a closet, take a walk or a hot bath. These exercises can reduce anger. (But hitting a punching bag, playing football or other violent activities won't.)<br />This book teaches kids how to develop self-control.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

1643362:US	52709697	R1PCCZ61PV7Q1E	0393048713	66176409	A Life in Pieces: The Making and Unmaking of Binjamin Wilkomirski	Books	5	12	13	N	Y	Archetypal	When I read Fragments I could not understand how anyone could have believed Binjamin Wilkomirski's story. It was incredible that a child as small as he claimed to have been could have survived a Nazi death camp (much less two) or recalled the things he claimed to remember. By the time I read it, the book had been exposed as fiction. But the tale seemed to me so weak that I doubted I would have found it any more convincing had I read it in 1996, before the scandal broke.<br /><br />As a longtime student of the Holocaust, I was therefore fascinated by Wilkomirski's exposure as Bruno Doessekker, the Swiss birth-child of Yvonne Berthe Grosjean, who surrendered her son for adoption in 1945; he was ultimately adopted by the Doessekkers.<br /><br />Stefen Maechler's [[ASIN:0805211357 Wilkomirski Affair]] (2001) provided a superb and thorough expose of the fraud Bruno Grosjean Doessekker perpetrated. Maechler pursued every possible lead, compared each minute detail in Doessekker's narration of \\"events\\" with historical records from such leading Holocaust scholars as Raul Hilberg and Lawrence Langer and accounts of other child survivors. He interviewed members of the Doessekker and Grosjean families and more. The most damning evidence Maechler unearthed was that in 1981, Doessekker/Wilkomirski contested the will of Yvonne Grosjean, whom, in a letter to officials in Bern Switzerland, he called \\"my birth mother.\\" He received a third of her estate.<br /><br />Wilkomirski/Doessekker had also used Laura Grabowski, who claimed to have known him in a children's home in Krakow, to \\"corroborate\\" his story. In fact, Grabowski is an American citizen of Christian faith who has since her youth fabricated stories about her victimhood, the most well-publicized being a book called Satan's Sideshow: The Real Story of Lauren Stratford. Lauren Stratford's Social Security number is the same as that of Grabowski, who used it to make a false survivor's claim. Maechler even found similarities between Satan's Sideshow and Fragments. But Maechler did not answer the question of how Wilkomirski/Doessekker drew people in.<br /><br />Blake Eskin masterfully picks up that loose strand from a personal perspective: His maternal great-grandmother Anna Wilbur had immigrated in 1929 to New York from Riga--the Latvian city Wilkomirski/Doesseker said he was from. Her family had changed their surname name from Wilkomirski to Wilbur on their arrival in New York. Moreover, Anna Wilbur's brother and sister-in-law had in 1926 lived at 80 Moskva Street, the same address Wilkomirski/Doessekker claimed as his. Thus was Eskin's family taken in.<br /><br />They understandably longed for news of distant relations left behind in Riga, years before the Holocaust. They knew existentially what the Holocaust had done. They had not yet personalized the loss, however. In that context, it is not surprising that Eskin's mother, Eden Force Eskin, and her first cousin once removed, Miriam Vim, wanted to believe that Wilkomirski/Doesseker was Anna Wilbur's long lost nephew.<br /><br />Eskin takes readers on his two-fold journey, as he discovers both Doessekker/Wilkomirski's fraud and his family's roots in Riga and Israel. He covers some of the same ground as Maechler, but he adds a human dimension of which Maechler's sturdy reportorial account is devoid.<br /><br />This book opens new intellectual and emotional understanding to losses suffered by the world's Jewish community during the Holocaust. Even now, families that once believed they had completely escaped that terrible trauma are discovering whom and what they lost---family, culture, language, and an entire world. Though but one example of that discovery, Eskin's investigations prove somewhat archetypal.<br /><br />The Nazi Holocaust extinguished the lives of roughly a third of the Jewish people. Some families, like Eskin's, remained for years oblivious to their personal losses. But Eskin shows that very few were untouched. In that context, it's easy to see why families still hope to find their members among the living. And that context is the only thing that can lay the Wilkomirski/Doessekker fraud to its final and necessary rest.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

She introduced the tiny character named K'tonton in the September 1930 issue of Outlook magazine.<br /><br />Isaac Samuel ben Baruch Reuben--whose first name meant laughter--was a late-born miracle. His mother had wanted a child so badly that in her Sukkot prayers, she promised to love even a child \\"no bigger than a thumb.\\" Sure enough, before a year had passed, she gave birth to a son. And sure enough, he was no bigger than her thumb. She blanketed him in the flax she had used to wrap an etrog--the Israeli citrus fruit used to celebrate Sukkot--and cradled him in a hand-carved etrog box.<br /><br />An educational director and Chazan, whose students loved the tales, recommended the book. I am glad I followed up, because my son adores this magical little fellow. Each 2 to 5-page tale is filled with details about important Jewish ideas or traditions, and a dash of Jewish humor. The evening story hour brings eager requests not for one or two stories, but three.<br /><br />This 16-story 1976 volume appeared as a sequel to The Adventures of K'tonton (1935) and K'tonton in Israel (1964). It is illustrated by Michael Berenstain. (His parents Stan and Jan created the Berenstain Bears in 1962, which Michael also illustrated).<br /><br />In the first book, K'tonton slid down the side of a chopping bowl, made his first trip to the synagogue on the harvest festival of Sukkot, rode on the tip of a lulav (the palm branch used in the celebration), planned a palace for the Sabbath Queen, saved the birds on Shabbat Shirah, planted trees in Israel, rode a spinning Chanukah dreidel, turned up in a Purim cookie covered with poppy seeds and celebrated Pesach with help from a mouse.<br /><br />In the prologue, the author explains that K'tonton had just returned to his parents on Shabbat Nachamu, the Sabbath of Comfort. He had been lost for three months. The stories tell what happened in that time.<br /><br />K'tonton's parents took him for a picnic at the beach. There, K'tonton simply disappeared. His mother had stuck him into his father's hat band, to protect him from the wind. As the wind grew, a gust lifted his father's hat off, with K'tonton on it. It blew right onto a seagull, which flew off. His parents had no idea where he was. The hat landed in the ocean, and then in some reeds. On that lonely island, K'tonton was rescued by a duck, whose ducklings warmed him. The second day and story landed K'tonton in a bird's nest, where among other things he thanked God for giving back his life.<br /><br />In the next nine stories, K'tonton built a house from a seashell, moved it to a drier spot, befriended a turtle, found food and water, repaid the mother duck's kindness. He welcomed the Sabbath Queen with fireflies instead of candles and fed his new animal friends with the bountiful harvest of the wilderness. He made clothes from the beach grasses, greeted the new moon, and celebrated Shavuot. In one story he coped with the insects. In another, he grew very sad and cheered himself in wonderful ways.<br /><br />In the last two stories, K'tonton helped a wounded swallow and found a way to leave the island. The book closes with a nine-page section about the holidays K'tonton celebrated on the island.<br /><br />This book is a great read-aloud for children of all ages.

She was the one the teacher chose to umpire the day's game of recess kickball. Here was Noreen wearing black shoes with white laces, and lacy white socks. And Noreen had the audacity to tell Calliope she was out.<br />Calliope did what she could to hate Noreen. But to every challenge Calliope presented, Noreen rose. The girls' bad beginning grew into a strong friendship that involved a plot to transform Noreen's pet parrot Baby into Captain Tweakerbeak. They taught him language appropriate for a pirate bird, and presented him to their class, complete with the pirate's scarf on his head and an eye patch. He wasn't a sea parrot, but a space pirate: \\"Silence earthling,\\" he told the cheeky boy in the front row.<br />The children liked the parrot too much, though, and the teacher sent Calliope to the office with him. She discovered the intercom on, and instantly cooked up a prank. \\"This is Commander Zero, leader of the Red First Squadron, Planet Mars. We have seized your school. Do not, I repeat, do not panic.\\" The plan ended in disaster when Captain Tweakerbeak reverted to Baby's personality.<br />Naturally, Calliope was in for it. But the events that overtook our mischievous little heroine and the cigar-smoking parrot must, I am afraid, remain secret, until you read this book.<br />Here's a hint for parents, though: This book will keep your third or fourth grader reading for hours.

In 1492 they were the only place in the world where cloves grew. The earliest written version of Cinderella is from China. As the author indicates in the afterward, no one knows where the story originated. But she speculates that Cinderella may have traveled West with the spices.<br />Damura was a child when her mother taught her to light a fire, cook, and to tend and harvest rice. But she still loved dolls when her mother died. The lorikeet and little green parrot outside in the nutmeg tree were not company enough for her. With a new doll, a neighboring widow bribed Damura into convincing her father to marry her. Her stepmother's two daughters were kind at first, but soon made Damura their servant. She cried at night that she had traded her happiness for a doll.<br />One day as she washed the family's clothes, she lost her sarong in the river. She called to the creatures of the wild for help, and a crocodile appeared. \\"Good morning Grandmother,\\" she said to the crocodile.<br />The crocodile gave Damura her baby to care for, and returned with a silver sarong that sparkled like the night sky. She told Damura to take it and come to the river again if she ever needed anything.<br />Her stepsisters were naturally jealous of the sarong. But when they tried to entice the crocodile to help them, she saw through their façade. A year later, the village buzzed with excitement as the prince planned to hold a dance to choose his bride. Damura asked her stepmother if she might go, wearing her silver sarong. Of course her stepmother refused her.<br />The rest of this tale is very similar to that of Cinderella.

The class returning to an unnamed grammar school for its final year were happy about finishing a French summer that grown boring, but found their new teacher, Hubert Noel, decidedly alarming.<br /><br />He sat behind the desk like some unmovable tree trunk, and was so fat that Mohammed wondered if he were seeing double, or triple. He had so many wrinkles that some students thought he resembled \\"those pictures of God, with messy white hair and reading glasses perched on the end of his nose, not to mention the balloon potbelly.\\" His voice sounded like it came from the bowels of the earth.<br /><br />But most alarming of all were the first words he spoke. Not, \\"my name is,\\" or \\"sit down please\\" but \\"I have a present for you.\\" And then the monstrosity gave each student a wrapped package. Inside, the children each discovered a book of coupons. They were not the kind of coupons one could use in a store.<br /><br />No, each book contained one coupon for activities usually forbidden by schools --- sleeping late, skipping a day of school, being late to school, losing your homework, forgetting your books, not listening in class, sleeping in class, copying from your neighbor, not going when called to the blackboard, getting out of trouble, eating in class, making a lot of noise, singing at the top of your lungs when you like, dancing in class, taking a break, clowning around, telling a lie and giving the teacher a kiss.<br /><br />The children were so startled by what they found that Benedicte, whom Mr. Noel appointed to read the coupons, had to stop, and Mohammed took over. He read six more coupons --- one each for hugging whomever you like, taking your own sweet time, taking a never-ending recess, forgetting the books for your assignment, taking a longer vacation and the piece de resistance, one wild card coupon.<br /><br />At first the students used lots of coupons, but as the year progressed, they found that it was more fun to come to school and use the coupons en masse. This made for some surprising capers.<br /><br />Everything Mr. Noel offered them was some present. An assignment to read Charles Dickens, for example, began with their receipt of gift-wrapped copies of David Copperfield. Try as they might to avoid reading it, they rather enjoyed the --- er, presents --- that Mr. Noel had given them. Aside from the pleasant fact that the author had the same name, Charles found he could not put the book down, and stayed up all night reading, which led him to use his late-to-school coupon the next day.<br /><br />Before long, Mr. Noel got himself into very hot water with the tyrannical school principal, Incarnation Perez. How he extracted himself from that difficulty is but one of the things that makes this book magical.<br /><br />Another is the priceless lesson that Mr. Noel imparted. \\"When you're born, you get a whole bunch of coupons.\\"<br /><br />Which ones? Charles, Laurent, and Benedicte shouted, the coupons for life --- for walking, speaking, learning to read, learning languages, learning geography biology and all the other `ologies,' for sports, the coupons for love.<br /><br />Then the children did something very wild with their 26 collected wild card coupons.

Try as they might to avoid reading it, they rather enjoyed the --- er, presents --- that Mr. Noel had given them. Aside from the pleasant fact that the author had the same name, Charles found he could not put the book down, and stayed up all night reading, which led him to use his late-to-school coupon the next day.  Before long, Mr. Noel got himself into very hot water with the tyrannical school principal, Incarnation Perez. How he extracted himself from that difficulty is but one of the things that makes this book magical.  Another is the priceless lesson that Mr. Noel imparted. \\"When you're born, you get a whole bunch of coupons.\\"  Which ones? Charles, Laurent, and Benedicte shouted, the coupons for life --- for walking, speaking, learning to read, learning languages, learning geography biology and all the other `ologies,' for sports, the coupons for love.  Then the children did something very wild with their 26 collected wild card coupons. But you'll have to read this delightful tale to find out what.  --- Alyssa A. Lappen	2002-02-17

She introduced the tiny character named K'tonton in the September 1930 issue of Outlook magazine.<br />K'tonton in Israel appeared in 1964 as a sequel to The Adventures of K'tonton (1935). There were 23 stories in the first edition (which I own); I hope they're all in the 3-volume 1984 reprint.<br />An educational director and Chazan recommended K'tonton to me and I am glad I followed up. My son adores the magical little main character. Each evening's story hour brings eager requests not for one or two stories, but three. Each tale has a complex all its own and is filled with details of important Jewish ideas or traditions, and a dash of Jewish humor.<br />K'tonton, Hebrew for very very little, was the nickname of Isaac Samuel ben Baruch Reuben-whose first name meant laughter. He was a late-born miracle for whom his mother had prayed so hard one Sukkot that she promised to love even a child \\"no bigger than a thumb.\\" Sure enough, before a year had passed, she gave birth to a son. And sure enough, he was no bigger than her thumb. She blanketed him in the flax she had used to wrap an etrog--the Israeli citrus fruit used to celebrate Sukkot--and cradled him in a hand-carved etrog box.<br />In this book's first story, K'tonton went to Israel on an El Al jet-inside the suitcase of a friend's aunt. Next, he went up to Jerusalem, passing an Israel National Fund forest, where a tree was planted when he was born. The third tale took K'tonton to Jerusalem for a special celebration of Pesach, the redemption of the Hebrew slaves.<br />The fourth found K'tonton at Mount Zion, which in 1964 had Israel's only view of Jerusalem's Old City, the Temple Mount and HaKotel, the Temple's remaining Western Wall. Two more stories brought K'tonton adventures with the President of Israel and children who mistook him for a puppet. How he escaped I won't tell.<br />K'tonton next obtained wisdom from a donkey, as in ancient times. K'tonton met Jewish and Arab children in a Hadassah clinic. He traveled to Ramat Rahel for more shenanigans. In the tenth tale, he made his way via an Arab milk wagon to Rachel's tomb near Bethlehem.<br />K'tonton's size allowed him to easily hide. Thus in the 11th story he washed his face in dew, jumped into a vegetable basket a woman carried on her head, said his morning prayers: \\"Glorify the Lord, O Jerusalem\\" and made it to the gates of the Old City. In the 12th, K'tonton caused a stir in the market (I can't say how) and met an understanding tourist.<br />In seven more stories K'tonton prayed for peace at HaKotel, found a treasure, visited a desert kibbutz, Tel Aviv, Ashkelon, an observatory at Haifa's Mount Carmel, outer space, Beersheba, the Dead Sea-and took a wild ride on a goat. He discovered some ancient prayer scrolls and saved a crop of wheat from an army of mice. (What you read here are mere hints. I'm not allowed to tell the details.)<br />Each of the 23 stories in this book has its own adventure-filled plot. Each also contains treasures to match those K'tonton found in Eretz Yisrael.

In September, Jack, the child narrator in Miss Stretchberry's Room 105, can't understand an unnamed \\"poem about/the red wheelbarrow/and the white chickens\\" (William Carlos Williams). In October, a few pages later, he fails to grasp \\"the tiger tiger burning bright poem/but at least it sounded good in my ears\\" (William Blake). By January, he's concluded that \\"Mr. Robert Frost/ who wrote/about the pasture/ was also the one/ who wrote about/ those snowy woods/ and the miles to go/ before he sleeps---well!\\"<br />That is also the month Jack writes a poem about his family's trip to the dog pound. There, he chose from among \\"big and small/ fat and skinny/ some of them/ hiding in the corner/ but most of them bark-bark-barking and/ jumping up against the wire cage\\" a yellow dog standing \\"with his paws curled around the wire/and his long red tongue/ hanging out\\".<br />By March, Jack has waxed enthusiastic about a poem by \\"Mr. Walter Dean Myers/ the best best BEST/ poem/ever.\\" He has even related it to his experience with the yellow dog, whom he named Sky. In April, Jack writes to Mr. Walter Dean Myers. And in May the poet agrees to visit the school. As Mr. Walter Dean Myers reads poems to the class on June 1, Jack finds \\"All of my blood/in my veins/ was bubbling/and all of the thoughts/ in my head/ were buzzing.\\" That's about how it feels to love a poem.<br />Several other important details make this book a keeper--not least, what happened to Jack's dog, and his closing poem.<br />At the end, Creech shares the eight poems to which she refers throughout: William Carlos Williams' \\"Red Wheelbarrow,\\" Robert Frost's \\"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\\" and \\"The Pasture,\\" William Blake's \\"Tiger,\\" Valerie Worth's \\"dog,\\" Arnold Adoff's \\"Street Music,\\" S.C.

This 64-page book features 18 tales from far corners of the earth--Japan, and the Middle East, China, France and Serbia, India and Africa--offering a different kind of word play. In each one, a central character says something that is at once the truth and a lie.<br /><br />The last story, for example, tells of four boys in Suriname two of whom bragged that their respective fathers were the best traders in town. The third, however, smiled and said that his father had them beat and the fourth boy agreed: He had with one ear of corn purchased a cow, a horse and a donkey. The father had indeed started with one ear of corn, and had indeed purchased a cow, a horse and a donkey--but not all at once, as the other boys supposed. Rather, he had planted the corn ear, sold his crop, bought a cow, sold it and bought a horse and sold it and bought a donkey.<br /><br />Similarly, another tale speaks of a poet named Mutanabbi who passed by Zubeida's house one day and decided to return that evening to propose that they be married. Halfway home, he encountered a handsome young man who was on his way to see Zubeida, \\"the most beautiful woman in the city,\\" whom he also wanted to marry. Mutanabbi was afraid of losing his chance, so he told the young man that he had just moments ago seen Zubeida kissing a wealthy man. The young man left, feeling lost. After learning that Mutanabbi had married Zubeida, he accused the former of lying. After all, if Zubeida had really kissed a wealthy man, why would she have chosen Mutanabbi? Why, the wealthy man she kissed was her father, of course.<br /><br />Another story features a Muslim holy man on the island of Celebes, who found a dark cave and crawled inside to escape from warring enemies. \\"If it hadn't been for the spider,\\" he told his friends afterwards, \\"I surely would have been caught and killed.\\" No one believed him, of course. But he had spoken the truth along with a lie. The spider had spun a web over the mouth of the cave, leading the holy man's enemies to believe that no one could possibly be inside. The man, however, had neglected to tell his friends was how the spider saved him.<br /><br />(This particular tale reminds me of the Jewish tale of David, who as a boy had questioned why God made spiders. Unlike the Muslim tale, however, the Midrash explains that God gave even the smallest creature a purpose. When David was grown, King Saul became angry with David and tried to kill him. David fled and hid in a cave. A spider spun his web across the cave's mouth. That night, soldiers passed the cave. King Saul reasoned that no man could hide there without tearing the web. And David thanked God for making spiders.)<br /><br />From this book, children learn that different traditions are often similar.

It reappeared in The Best of K'tonton, a 1980 compendium of 16 stories from three books.<br />K'tonton was in the kitchen when a kitten appeared at the door. He asked his mother to give it some milk. At first, she refused, since feeding the kitten would encourage it to come back every day. But she fed it, and it came back a second day. On the third day, K'tonton's mother was preparing taiglach (honey pastries) and set a cup of honey at the edge of the table to fetch the kitten's milk. Then she went to answer the phone.<br />Just then, K'tonton saw a stream of honey running down the side of the cup, and licked it off. There was more honey on the rim. K'tonton leaned forward to reach it and sent the cup crashing to the floor. His mother asked if K'tonton had done this. He didn't answer. She blamed the kitten, and he did not correct her.<br />The lesson is very simple and traditional for Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. \\"For sins against God, God can forgive. For sins against another person, only the person wronged can forgive.\\" But it's told in a way that small children can understand.<br />How K'tonton achieves atonement is what makes this story special.

As his father put his etrog carefully into its box to take to shul, K'tonton eagerly asked to join him. \\"Next year,\\" answered his father, \\"when you're a little bigger.\\" Like all over-eager boys, K'tonton did something he shouldn't, and climbed inside the etrog box to hide.<br />Once in shul, he couldn't see, so he climbed onto the lulav--the palm branch that is pointed east, west, south and north, to the heavens and to earth as part of the celebration. As K'tonton's father rose with the congregation to chant Hodu l'Adonai ki tov--Praise the Lord for God is good--there was K'tonton singing from atop the lulav, in a high treble that rose above all the other voices.<br />What happened next in this great tale of a tiny boy will light children's eyes.

He took in the big trees, which sank their roots deep and lifted the branches up, up, up toward the sky. Then he heard a step-th-hump, step-th-hump, step-th-hump, and compared the mystery sound to the churr-rrr-rrr of raccoon babies and the purr-rrr of kittens.<br />It came from a man carrying a bundle, a man with one leg and a leg made of a wooden peg. The man sat down by the pond and washed himself, unwrapped his bundle and ate apples, cheese and bread. After washing his dishes, he began to juggle them. His juggling made music, which the language creates: tink-ki-tink-ki-ki-tink-ki-tink. And so on, for a whole page.<br />Ty watched from the grass. Then came a rumble like thunder in the distance--a train. Woo-woo-woo-ee-ee-eee. Ty forgot the man as he listened to the clackety-clack of and the train whistle as the wheels died away.

Bates ought to have been going into fourth grade in the fall. But he had flunked third grade the year before. He couldn't read well enough, and his math skills left something to be desired.<br />Having to enter a third grade class with kids a year younger was a humiliation for Joshua. Everyone at Mirch Elementary knew it and would not let him forget. Worse than that--if such a thing were possible--was the pasting he took on the schoolyard from the school bullies. Neither Tommy Wilhelm nor Billy Nickel would let Joshua play team sports with the fourth graders.<br />Joshua of course pulled his studies together and showed up both bullies in a rather surprising set of circumstances. How he did it is what keeps children turning these pages.<br />I read this story aloud to one of our children, in her reluctant reader stage. By the end, she was anxious to read alone.

She blanketed him in the flax she had used to wrap an etrog--the Israeli citrus fruit used to celebrate Sukkot--and cradled him in a hand-carved etrog box.<br /><br />The 16 stories here were selected from Weilerstein's three K'tonton volumes--The Adventures of K'tonton (1935); K'tonton in Israel (1964) and K'tonton on an Island in the Sea (1976).<br /><br />An educational director and Chazan, whose students loved the tales, recommended the book. I am glad I followed up, because my son adores this magical little fellow.

Take K'tonton's slide down the side of a chopping bowl in which his mother was mixing Shabbat gefilte fish. He wanted a ride on the chopping knife. He predictably ended up covered in fish, a vision (illustrated in beautiful black and white ink) that makes kids ring with the laughter of Isaac.<br /><br />Similarly, children emit gales of laughter on hearing of K'tonton's ride on the tip of a lulav--the palm branch that is pointed east, west, south and north, to the heavens and to earth as part of the harvest celebration of Sukkot. As K'tonton's father and the entire congregation stand to chant Hodu l'Adonai ki tov--Praise the Lord for God is good--there was K'tonton singing in a high treble that rose above all the other voices. Even more hilarious is the spinning Chanukah dreidel that carried him off the table, down the stairs, out the door, into the street and into a gutter, where K'tonton found a small bit of Chanukah money known in Yiddish as gelt.<br /><br />K'tonton also turned up in a Purim cookie, a Hamentash, covered with poppy seeds, and tried to feed a hungry cat on Yom Kippur. He also got lost at the beach and was carried on the back of a seagull to an island in the sea, where he welcomed the Sabbath Queen with fireflies instead of candles and the bountiful harvest of the wilderness. On the island, he also shared wild fruit and seed bread on Shavuot, the celebration of the gift of Torah, with his new family--Mouse, Rabbit, birds, Turtle and Toad.<br /><br />In the last four stories, K'tonton made his way to Israel inside the suitcase of a friend's aunt. There, in Jerusalem, he celebrated Pesach, the redemption of the Hebrew slaves, and righted some wrongs.<br /><br />If your children don't love this book, I'll eat my hat.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

Avishai Margalit and Ian Buruma define a cluster of anti-Western and anti-American ideas that played a large role in the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The haters see \\"arrogance, feebleness, greed, depravity, and decadence\\" as peculiarly Western or American traits, which they believe must be stamped out.<br /><br />Islamist anti-Western ideas, rooted in fascism, mirror those of Hirohito's Japan, and of course, Hitler's Germany. Jorge Semprun's 1997 Literature or Life also notes the similarity between the two ideologies. He doesn't develop that point, but I was reaching the same conclusion when articles by Benjamin Netanyahu, Bernard Lewis and Daniel Pipes, among others confirmed my thinking. In exploring Islamism's ideological predecessors, Occidentalism serves as a brilliant companion to Bernard Lewis' equally brilliant book.<br />Readers familiar with Efraim and Inari Karsh's superb Empires of the Sand or David Fromkin's Peace to End All Peace may have an easier time absorbing myriad historical events in Lewis' thin but substantive volume. One need not know the history to understand what he says, however.<br /><br />Lewis explains not the Islamists' anti-Western ideas, but the background for them. The history of Islamic defeats at the hands of the West--in trade, technology, printing, science, philosophy, political development, modernization, diplomacy, war--stretches back 600 years. In 1502 Venice warned the Ottoman Sultans of the threat posed to the spice trade by the sea route Vasco de Gama had opened up between Europe and Asia. The Ottomans ignored the warning, just as they ignored many other problems, and the Muslim East eventually felt the results.<br /><br />To a Westerner this might seem odd. As Lewis has previously pointed out, Muslim peoples are both shaped by their history and keenly aware of it. The Muslim pulpit, schools, and media nourish the people's sense of history. While often slanted and inaccurate, teachings frequently reference events and personalities of the 7th century. But where in the West, historians consider the past partly to avoid repeating it, the Muslim East historically took different lessons from historical study. In Medieval times, Muslims wrote \\"vast, rich and varied historical literature,\\" none of it on non-Muslims or even on pre-Muslim regional history.<br /><br />Lewis reviews both events centuries before the demise of the Ottoman Empire and the cultural incompatibility which colonial powers carried into the region. The British and French constitutional and parliamentary systems for example collapsed in places unable to understand or support them. The fascist ideological and political systems of 1930s Germany and Italy, on the other hand, gained wide support and rooted, even after those countries were defeated in World War II.<br /><br />Lewis covers myriad other cultural gaps as well. These include widely divergent attitudes on everything from women and science to music. Namik Kemal, a leader of the Young Ottomans, in 1867 expounded on the need to liberate and educate women and an Egyptian named Qasim Amin expanded the views in 1899. Concubinage fell by the wayside; Polygomy is now rare except in Arabia. (Slavery is still practiced in several Arab countries.) But Lewis notes that women's rights have become, for traditionalists, a noxious symbol of Westernization which must be barred from Islam, \\"and where it has already entered, must be ruthlessly excised.\\"<br /><br />Profound differences also occur over separation of faith and state. In Islam, the two are inseparable. In the Christian West, they can and must be separated. Even the sense of time and space is different. Arabs may have divided the day into 24 hours, but as they gradually imported mechanical clocks from Europe, they still had to be reset daily according to an oldtradition and locally-made clocks lagged those of Europe.<br /><br />Even the approaches to modernity differ sharply. Within a broad historical perspective, Lewis writes, \\"cultural innovation is not and has never been the monopoly of one region or people. The same is true of resistance to it.\\" In short, neither the West nor Islam has a monopoly on success or failure.<br /><br />But Lewis nevertheless believes that for the Muslim Middle East, things have \\"gone badly wrong. Compared with its millennial rival, Christendom, the world of Islam had become poor, weak, and ignorant.\\" By the 19th century, as modernizers focused on military, economic and political reforms, results in Islam were disappointing. Quests for victory led to military defeats. Economic development nevertheless left whole nations impoverished, corrupt, in need of external aid and largely dependent on one resource--oil. Remedies failed. And the rise in nationalism--another European import--allowed and even encouraged Arabs to blame others for their failures. This included blaming Jews, and after 1948, Israel.<br /><br />If Lewis is right, the war now facing Western nations has roots in the 15th century. The current path could make the suicide bomber a metaphor for the Middle East. That would lead to yet another alien domination. The alternative, Lewis concludes, is for Muslims to \\"abandon grievance and victimhood, settle their differences, and join their talents, energies and resources in a common endeavor\\" to again make the region \\"a major center of civilization.\\"<br /><br />Whether or not one agrees with his conclusion, Lewis provides ample insight into the causes of the world's current strife.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

1676556:US	52709697	R17S6UBBHQQQRK	1893554430	755889913	The Mideast Peace Process: An Autopsy	Books	5	25	29	N	Y	The death of peace	In 1993, millions of people enthusiastically supported the Oslo peace accords. I was one of them. From the Jewish and Israeli perspectives, it was incredible and exhilarating to see the leader of Arab terrorists plan to recognize Israel's right to exist. The joyous prospect of an end to war, a lasting peace, allowed us to imagine a thrilling repeat of Anwar Sadat's triumphant visit to Jerusalem, to suspend our disbelief.<br /><br />Sadat had been murdered for his daring; he was not the first Arab leader killed for his pacifism and would likely not be the last. But we squelched all doubts.<br /><br />Now, all doors seemed open. At a heady November 1994 Jerusalem business conference, Tansu Cillar became the first Turkish Prime Minister to visit Israel. Arab, Jewish and Israeli businessmen and politicians applauded wildly, crying in joyful expectation, as she spoke of the peace dividend about to engulf the Fertile Crescent.<br /><br />Even in 1993 and 1994, skeptics warned that the perceived peace was, from the Arab side, a sham. Virtually no one in power--in Israel, the U.S., or Europe--listened to these professors, politicians and Middle East scholars who had spent their lives studying the region. But in Commentary magazine, they wrote their opinions, backed up by substantial and alarming data.<br /><br />The 11 articles in this powerfully persuasive book were culled from essays that appeared between September 1993 and May 2001 and are framed by Neal Kozodoy's forward and Mark Helprin's afterward. The first, by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu communications minister David Bar-Illan, marked the \\"historic handshake\\" of Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin on the White House lawn. It questioned why, given many disturbing facts, the Rabin government would throw caution to the winds.<br /><br />Washington, he noted, had promised Arafat \\"the return of territories according to resolutions 242 and 338,\\" which Arabs took to mean total withdrawal. Meanwhile, Washington had falsely assured Israel it would \\"give weight\\" to the latter's security concerns, that negotiations would be based on the 1978 formula from Camp David. While there could be an interim five-year period of Palestinian authority, with final status negotiations starting only in the third year, Washington assured Israel that every possibility would remain open. Given the incompatibility of these promises, Bar-Illan believed that hopes to achieve real peace were most likely mere chimera.<br /><br />The last essay, by noted Middle East historian Efraim Karsh, discussed all the reasons that the Arab claim to a right of return is fictitious. It closed with comments of the late (supposedly \\"moderate\\") Faisal Husseini, who had in his final speech exposed his radical aim. \\"[We] may win or lose,\\" Husseini said in March 2001. \\"But our eyes will continue to aspire to the strategic goal, namely to Palestine from the [Jordan] River to the [Mediterranean] sea.\\" In short, he desired Palestine to take Israel's place. Karsh noted that until Husseini's \\" 'supreme truth' is buried once and for all, no amount of Israeli good will, partial compensation, or symbolic acceptance of responsibility can hope to create anything but an appetite for more.\\"<br /><br />The nine essays in between each provided an alarming set of facts surrounding the peace accords as they occurred. Yigal Carmon, a former Israeli intelligence colonel and counter-terrorism adviser to Rabin, wrote in March 1994 that a path to dialogue with Yasser Arafat in 1988 was suspended in May 1990 after Arafat refused to condemn a PLO terrorist attack on a beach near Tel Aviv or disassociate from its commander, Abu Abbas. Norwegian social scientist Terje Larson in early 1992 nevertheless sought out Israeli Economic Cooperation Foundation chief Yossi Beilin, who a short time later became a deputy to Israel's Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres. Until December 1992, at least, Beilin negotiated without Prime Minister Rabin's knowledge. WhenRabin finally did learn, he proceeded anyway, comforted falsely by Arafat's promise to declare an end to \\"armed struggle\\" and the intifada. But when the Declaration of Principles was signed in September 1993, Arafat failed to keep his promise.<br /><br />Similarly, Douglas Feith wrote in June 1994 that Israel would be trading land for \\"no peace.\\" For everything that Arafat had promised in the DOP he had promised in 1988, to gain a dialogue with the U.S. government, and every promise he had made in 1988, he broke. By now it was clear that the PLO had not and would not change its covenant to recognize Israel's most basic right--to exist. In fact, the very day Arafat signed the DOP, Jordanian television aired a speech in which Arafat called for intensified jihad, struggle and \\"sacrifices.\\" Neither did the PLO leader delay his demands for sovereignty, as promised. Worse, Arab violence against Israel had actually increased. The DOP was supposedly conditional on Arafat's containing the violence. When the Arab violence continued, Feith cast the problem not as Israel's flexibility or intransigence, but \\"whether [Israel's] neighbors have the political leadership and the good will to sustain peace with a Jewish state on what, according to their religious and cultural convictions, is their land, Arab land--that is, anywhere in Palestine.\\"<br /><br />This idea was reiterated eloquently by Norman Podhoretz in a December 2000 essay, \\"Death of an Illusion?\\" He referred to T.S. Eliot's lines, \\"human kind/Cannot bear very much reality.\\" Here, he wrote, the \\"unbearable reality being evaded is that Israel's yearning for peace was shared neither by the Arab world in general nor by the Palestinians in particular--that their objection was not to anything Israel had done or failed to do, but to the very fact that it existed at all.\\"<br /><br />That sums up the Oslo Accords. Rather than the promised peace, they brought death and destruction. Since August 1993, more than 575 Israelis have been murdered by Arab terrorists, thousands maimed for life. The victims were not fighting, not at war. They were going about their daily lives, praying for the final peace that Israelis have sought since the state's 1948 establishment.<br /><br />This book will help you understand.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

It may be a learned behavior, but for some reason all kids learn to do it by the time they are two. The hard part is teaching them to unlearn.<br /><br />This 61-page picture book contains simple language easily read by first and second graders (on a par with Dr. Suess), but its sophistication about children's propensity to lie will keep them coming back until they are approaching middle school.<br /><br />The premise is simple: While everyone, even the author, has told some lies--\\"I'm late because my watch stopped, I did not spend my lunch money on candy\\"--most people need to tell the truth to feel good about themselves. People get along much better in life if they tell the truth.<br /><br />The book explains that there a lot of different kinds of lies, and a lot of reasons that people tell them. \\"Some people can look at others, face to face and they can tell an enormous WHOPPER. But when others lie, their faces get red, and they have to turn to look away.\\" People lie because they don't want to tell the truth, don't want to admit that they have done something wrong, prefer to blame others, think it will get them out of trouble. Lying, on the contrary, often gets people into even more trouble.<br /><br />Some of Moser's books are funny. Not this one. But Moser does make even adults look silly when they lie. A car salesman looks ridiculous telling his customer \\"This car is in perfect condition.\\" A politician, who promises, if elected, to raise only wages, but never to raise taxes, looks silly too. So does the kid who tells his friends that his uncle was an explorer before becoming an astronaut and a movie star.<br /><br />Next, kids learn about why it's important not to lie. First, liars need good memories, so they can remember who they lied to and what they told them. Otherwise, they'll get confused and will soon be caught in their lies. Worrying about this makes some liars unable to eat or sleep. It even makes them worry that people will stop believing or lose respect for them. If people want respect and trust from others, Moser tells kids, \\"you must apologize for lying and tell the truth.\\"<br /><br />Telling the truth, he concludes, is \\"like ice skating--the more you do it, the easier it becomes.\\" Once kids have digested this message, they tell the truth more often, and have every reason to feel proud.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

An African-American child in the deep South, she was nevertheless unaware of the hatred swirling around her, either in Tylertown Mississippi, where she was born in 1954, or in New Orleans, where her family moved in 1958. Her grandparents were all Mississippi sharecroppers, renting the land they worked with a portion of the cotton and other crops they grew, and struggling to live off the rest.<br /><br />But Ruby spent sheltered summers visiting her grandparents' farms, where she helped to pick and can the beans, cucumbers and other vegetables they grew on two acres reserved to feed the extended family. And at home in New Orleans, her safe and comfortable world of family, jacks, jump rope, tree-climbing, softball--and deep respect for God and her parents--existed entirely on her family's block, only one block away from a white neighborhood.<br /><br />Then in the summer of 1960, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) contacted Ruby's parents. The Federal court planned to force two white New Orleans schools to admit African-American children. Ruby was one of only a handful of black children who had been tested for admission to these schools, and passed. She was to attend the William Frantz Public School. Her father, Abon Bridges, was opposed to her going; he had fought in a segregated unit in the Korean War, and believed nothing would ever change. Her mother, Lucille, thought otherwise and convinced him to take the risk.<br /><br />Ruby started the year in her old school while Louisiana Governor Jimmie H. Davis led legislators in Baton Rouge in a fight to preserve segregation. They passed 28 new anti-integration laws and attempted to seize the public school system. Meanwhile Federal District Court Judge J. Skelly Wright upheld Federal laws requiring equal opportunity. Ruby was the only black child sent to William Frantz Public School, however. Another three students were to go to McDonough.<br /><br />The morning that Federal Marshals arrived to take Ruby to her new school, she only knew only that she was to start a new school, and was not afraid. The policemen at the school door made her think this was an important place. \\"It must be college,\\" she thought. She sat in the principal's office with her mother all day, and became frightened only when, as she left the school, she saw the crowds of white anti-integration protestors.<br /><br />The next day, Ruby joined a class with a white teacher named Barbara Henry, whose kindness rose above the fray. No other children joined the class, and within a few days, Ruby was going to school alone with the Marshals; her mother had to return to work. Then the Rev. Lloyd Foreman broke ranks with the white boycotts and sent his daughter Pam to school. The Ku Klux clan began burning crosses in black neighborhoods to frighten the people into giving up their fight for equality. The tension in New Orleans grew each day.<br /><br />But Ruby quickly became a symbol of freedom, appearing in John Steinbeck's Travels with Charley and a Norman Rockwell painting than ran in Look Magazine. When Abon Bridges lost his job at a local filling station for sending Ruby to a white school, the family began to receive gifts and money from all over the U.S. Even former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt wrote to Ruby.<br /><br />Some children might cower in fear after such experiences, refuse to go on. Ruby persevered, however, as did her upright family. As a child, she believed that prayer could get her through anything. And it accomplished a great deal.<br /><br />While she was unable to attend college, Ruby married and raised four sons. Over another 16 pages, Ruby Bridges tells about her subsequent experiences, her contributions and efforts, what she has learned and given.<br /><br />This historic story of courage and wisdom is worth its weight in gold for the hope it offers readers of all ages.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

Her father Benjamin had a study full of books and frequently entertained renowned visitors, including philosopher Martin Buber and Rabbi Paul Holzer. This began to unravel when the Nazis came to power. In the summer of 1934, the family traveled to a German spa in Bad Schwartau. As their visit ended, the spa's owner gleefully announced that Hitler would deal with the Jews. The next fall, nine-year-old Celia's grades began to falter as former school friends labeled her \\"Drechtjude.\\" In 1937, the family were forced out of their condominium at Hohe Weide 25. In October, 1938, her father was carted to prison, then deported to Dachau. In February 1941, a Gestapo agent delivered his \\"ashes\\" in a cigar box.<br /><br />Eight months later, Celia, now 16, was deported with her mother Sala and sister Karin to Lodz. Here they shared an unheated room on Zgierska Street with Julie and Julius Eichengreen and five others. As the vast majority of Jews were shipped like cattle from Lodz, the couple made Celia promise, if ever she went to New York, to find their son, who had left Europe years earlier. On July 13, 1942, Celia's starving and sick mother Sala died.<br /><br />Before being herself deported to Auschwitz in August 1944, Celia starved and scraped to survive, and lost her sister Karin as well. Her one friend from that period, Elli Sabin, traveled with her in the final transport from Lodz to new horrors. Here she came face to face with the dreaded Dr. Mengele, slaved for some months in an outdoor construction site at the Neuengamme subcamp and in the Blom and Foss Shipyards. In October, she was transferred to Arbeitslager Sasel. Here, to gain access to important files, she promised to transfer her family's house in Altona-Luna Park outside Hamburg to an SS guard. The ploy worked, and she memorized the names and addressed of 42 Nazi guards.<br /><br />In March 1945, Celia Landau was again transferred, this time to Bergen-Belsen, the disease-ridden camp where Anne Frank and her sister died of Typhus. Fortunately for Laudau, a month later, the camp was liberated, on April 15, 1945. Here she told a British major of her exploit, and was swiftly introduced to Lieutenant-Colonel J.H. Tilling, of Britain's War Crimes Investigations unit. When friends Elli, Hela Dimand and Sabina Zarecki corroborated her story, the British swiftly transferred Celia Landau to Hanover Germany, where she helped bring 17 Nazis to justice.<br /><br />Her assistance to the British War Crimes unit gave Celia new opportunities.

It shows a desire for freedom so strong that men, women and children risked their lives to escape on the Underground Railroad, following the largest star in the Drinking Gourd of the title (The Big Dipper).<br /><br />The book introduces the idea of slavery, the separation of families, the sale of human beings at auctions, and the difficulties that people endured to escape--hiding in trees to avoid hounds, sleeping by day, sometimes on empty stomachs, and walking at night, sometimes without stars to guide them. Sometimes people along the way were kind, providing bacon and corn bread to share, helping them across the Ohio River, and hiding them in the attics and barns of safe houses.<br /><br />The story's dramatic simplicity grasps and holds children.

Based on the life of Feodosia Ivanovna Belevstov, the author's mother-in-law, who was born in pre-Revolutionary Russia in 1907, it is one of survival under harsh conditions. The story takes place during the Russian revolution, when the Whites (Mensheviks) lost to the Bolsheviks (Reds), Stalin's 1930s purges and World War II. Belevstov and her husband, who by then had an infant daughter, were captured by the Germans and forced into slave labor. Belevstov emigrated to the U.S. following liberation in 1947. This is a story of hope.<br /><br />It also offers a tender treatment of the Romany people. As a child, the author's mother-in-law once saw a caravan of Gypsy wagons drawn by tired horses through the first snow. A man and his wife and infant stopped for water, which the child ran to get. She begged her mother to let the family stay the night with them. The young Gypsy woman somehow knew that while the child had a good heart, she was often ill, and told her mother, \\"Tonight is the first snow. It is a time of healing. Let me try to help her.\\"<br /><br />Having been to many doctors, all of whom were unable to treat the child's strange headaches, her mother cried in joy at the unexpected offer of assistance. The story goes on, \\"She bathed my temples with the water from the snowflakes.... She sang to me in her calm, deep voice. The song was old, old. I did not know the words, but they were soft and sure and rocked me quietly with their sound.\\" The next morning the girl awoke to the sound of Gypsy bells as the caravan left the town, and ran after them to say goodbye.<br /><br />Ten years later, another caravan arrived, this time bearing a fortune-teller who predicted that the girl, now married, would some day cry out for a crust of bread, pray to endure one more hour, take every step in pain. Of course, with the revolution and World War II, all this came to pass, and the rest of the story is framed lovingly around the fortune that the Romany woman told.<br /><br />The vibrant illustrations evoke the quality of Russian folk art.

I would not hesitate to rank it among the top ten masterpieces of 20th century drama.<br /><br />Plays come and go, but this one, first produced at London's Royal Court in 1995, has all the hallmarks of a timeless treasure. It's drama, and poetry, full of unbelievably rich characterizations and history of Ireland's Time of Troubles.<br /><br />Thomas Dunne, the seventy-something Da, anchors the play firmly, though not exactly in the play's here and now, about 1932.<br /><br />Three of Da's four children have relegated him to an Irish county home, not for lack of love. No, Da's gone mad, as his effervescent lapses into the past make altogether real.<br /><br />He is not so mad, though, not to know the truth of things, and there is the beauty in this Lear-like drama.<br /><br />Play-lovers will melt on reading or hearing the final 15-minute soliloquy of this masterpiece. Da tells about a dog he had as a child, a dog his father did not want him to have, one that he brought home anyway.<br /><br />\\"And I knew that dog and me were for slaughter. My feet carried me on to where he stood, immortal you would say in the door. And he put his right hand on the back of my head, and pulled me to him so that my cheek rested against the buckle of his belt....<br /><br />\\"And I would call that the mercy of fathers, when the love that lies in them deeply like the glittering face of a well is betrayed by an emergency, and the child sees at last that he is loved, loved and needed and not to be lived without, and greatly.\\"<br /><br />That hint of the powerful closing, though, is just the beginning.

He also states, at the end of chapter 10, &#34;The road to peace lies in recognition of the realities, including the reality that is Israel, and I will do nothing to harm the cause of peace.&#34; Equally praiseworthy.<br /><br />Yet this book is full of contradictions.<br /><br />Born in 1937 in Nazareth, Bishop Abu El-Assal fled with his family at age 11 in 1948 to Beirut, where his father refused to register the family as refugees. They fled of their own accord, not as the result of any battle or threat thereof, or the author would have made great use of the details.<br /><br />Yet with neither firsthand experience of being forced off the family's land, nor reputable sources, El-Assal describes Al Nakba, the Catastrophe, as &#34;expulsion of the Palestinians from their lands by the victorious Zionist forces....&#34; (p. 51)<br /><br />Here is a man whose wife's family had in the 1930s emigrated from Lebanon INTO Palestine, where Jewish development had created strong demand for labor. El -Assal himself returned to Nazareth from Beirut in 1949 with his sister Suad, who was then 13. Some time later, his father also returned. He took Israeli citizenship in 1959. He successfully reclaimed and repossessed his family's home.<br /><br />In other words, neither the Bishop of Jerusalem nor his wife's family has any basis to claim that anything was stolen from them. Yet he does. In fact, throughout the book he claims that the entire land of Israel was &#34;stolen&#34; from Palestinian Arabs, without references to back up this claim. The 151-page volume contains only 15 footnotes, not one of them citing legitimate scholarly material to prove the claim.<br /><br />I tend to believe no such scholarly material exists, for I have looked and found none. On the other hand, several books seem to prove just the opposite. These include H.B. Tristram's Land of Israel (1865); Arieh Avneri's [[ASIN:0878559647 The Claim of Dispossession: Jewish Land-Settlement and the Arabs, 1878-1948]] (1984); Kenneth W. Stein's [[ASIN:0807815799 The Land Question in Palestine, 1917-1939]] (1984); Samuel Katz' [[ASIN:0929093135 Battleground: Fact & Fantasy in Palestine]] (1972) and Joan Peters' From Time Immemorial (1984).<br /><br />Abu Al-Assal also attempts to deflate the importance and severity of the 1948 invasion of Israel by seven Arab armies by claiming that most of the fighting was done in Palestinian areas. This is misleading at best. For had not those armies swept into the area, there would have been no fighting at all. Much of the fiercest fighting, moreover, was in the Negev, which the partition plan had designated for Israel. As it was, the war took substantially more Jewish lives, a total of 6,373--nearly 1% of the entire Jewish population. Jewish casualties, moreover, included 600 kidnap victims whom Arab forces mutilated beyond recognition.<br /><br />Though a citizen of Israel, El-Assal cheered on Gamel Nasser in 1956. He has repeatedly broken Israeli laws and has quite negative feelings for the state. He traveled many times on a Vatican passport to enemy states, including Lebanon and Jordan (before the peace). He twice traveled to Tunisia to meet with Yasser Arafat, before Israel had relations with the PLO. Afterwards, he resented being detained from international travel. He dislikes Israel, its Jewish symbols, and its internal policy of accepting any Jewish person as a citizen of the Jewish homeland. While he admires the beauty of the Israeli national anthem HaTikva (The Hope), he writes that the Zionist movement's hymn, expressing a Jewish desire for a homeland, &#34;is not mine, and never can be.&#34;<br /><br />He claims to be for two separate states, Israel and Palestine, but argues for an Israel that is secular and bi-national. In other words, he considers Jewish desire to nurturea Jewish homeland a bad thing.<br /><br />Given that El-Assal is an Anglican Bishop, one would expect to find in his book some evidence of closeness with God. Abu El-Assal mentions his &#34;calling,&#34; of course. Yet I was surprised to find no real expression of spiritual awareness, love for God, Christ, or mankind. Perhaps I missed it but I don't think so.<br /><br />In fact, the author actually makes statements I would have thought un-Christian. In a discussion of the different Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox Easters, for example, he recounts the story of a father who tells his son on the first that people are crying &#34;because Jesus was crucified.&#34; When the son asks who did it, the father says, &#34;The Jews and the Romans were responsible. Damn the Romans.&#34; The boy replies, &#34;Damn the Jews.&#34; At the second service, when the people weep again, the boy asks, &#34;Dad, Dad, do you mean the Jews and the Romans have done it again?&#34; No, the father tells him, it was the Greek Orthodox. (pp. 59-60)<br /><br />Granted, this tasteless story is supposed to be a joke. But no person of Jewish faith would find it funny. Neither should an Anglican Bishop. The Roman Catholic Pope and Church, at least, have apologized to the Jewish people for centuries of teaching that the Jewish people were responsible for the death of Jesus. So should all churches.<br /><br />There are many other weaknesses in this book, not least of all its complete failure to denounce anti-Semitic Arab propaganda taught to each new generation, making meaningful dialogue between the Jewish state and Arab Palestinian people all but impossible. Like too many people, Al-Assal is willing to completely overlook institutionalized Arab hatred of Jews and the Jewish state, meanwhile making blanket condemnations of Israel's supposed evils--which he cannot and does not prove.<br /><br />One hopes for true and honest Palestinian Arab peace partners to emerge from the ongoing 53-year conflict.

From their point of view, he knows too much. His Investigative Project has logged more than 6,000 hours of video and audio tapes, and its library is probably the world's most comprehensive on radical Islam. Emerson has thus for years lived in hiding, emerging only for talks and meetings to impart what he knows. In this book, he reveals an American intelligence system so full of holes that it resembles finely aged Swiss cheese. Readers get a solid, albeit unpleasant, taste.<br />Emerson reveals the vision of a globe dominated by Islam prevalent among radical Islamic forces everywhere for the last two decades. Emerson's chatty account backs up this seeming scare mongering with enough facts about radical Islam's worldwide network to curdle one's blood. These forces have for 12 years achieved a new level of coordination, owing to their exploitation of civil liberties in the U.S.<br />\\"None of these groups was ever able to coordinate its worldwide efforts with the others until they came to the United States,\\" Emerson writes. They use freedoms of speech and assembly with little oversight from the FBI, CIA, Immigration and Naturalization Service or any number of other U.S. agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Aviation Administration, and so on. Let us hope that free world leaders are listening.<br />Emerson opens his first-person account with details on how he was drawn to pursue and document radical Islam. In 1992, as a reporter for CNN, he was covering an Oklahoma City press conference at which of former Iran-contra special prosecutor Lawrence Welsh released a statement from President Bush (le pere), pardoning former Secretary of State Casper Weinberger. He was bored.<br />On December 25, Emerson passed some men in Arab robes clustered outside the Oklahoma City Convention Center. The Muslim Arab Youth Association meeting inside featured a \\"bazaar of vendors hawking all kinds of radical material,\\" books preaching Islamic jihad, calling for the extermination of Christians and Jews, even coloring books instructing children 'How to Kill the Infidel'--and speakers from Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood (founded in Egypt in 1920s), Palestinian Islamic Jihad, among others. A Detroit FBI agent fielded questions from \\"a visibly hostile audience\\" cheekily asking for \\"advice on how to ship weapons overseas.\\"  Emerson's call to FBI headquarters produced the astounding revelation that the FBI could and would do little to monitor these groups.<br />Although a print journalist, Emerson after the February 26 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center pitched to the U.S. Public Broadcasting System a story on the recruitment and training of radical Islamic warriors inside America. The resulting hour-long program, Jihad in America, aired on November 21, 1994 and is available free on the Internet. In a Brooklyn, N.Y. Yemeni grocery store, Emerson found and bought 20 copies of videos promoting paramilitary training. His reporting took him to Florida, Texas, Chicago, the Middle East and Pakistan.<br />The first calls for global jihad came from a Palestinian Arab mullah, Abdullah Azzam, whose base in Peshawar, Pakistan recruited and trained Muslim warriors for a jihad against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Azzam was killed in 1989 with his two oldest sons, a murder that went unsolved. But his followers, including a third son in Pakistan and a nephew in Chicago, spread his seditious message everywhere. On a 1993 trip to the West Bank, Emerson and translator Khalid Duran learned from a taxi driver that Azzam's brother-in-law lived in Jenin and from there, obtained more interviews.<br />El-Sayeed Nosair, who murdered Rabbi Meir Kahane in New York, led to 47 boxes of Arabic material, which police unfortunately ignored until after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Nosair had planned to \\"thoroughly demoralize the enemies of God\\" by blowing up and destroying theWorld Trade Center. The February 1993 WTC bombing killed six and injured more than 1,000 others.<br />Investigators eventually discovered the error in believing the WTC plotters inept. In fact, they were tied to a global network of al-Qaeda terrorists, including Mohammed Salameh, Palestinian Ramzi Yousef, Ahmad Ajaj, Nidal Ayyad, Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, a blind Egyptian cleric who ran a New Jersey mosque, and Osama bin Laden. One lieutenant, Ali Mohammed, was an officer in the U.S. Army's Special Forces. Their interconnected plots included theft of U.S. government documents, construction and operation of training camps within the U.S. and a 1994 plan to murder Pope John Paul II and blow up 11 American jetliners. The last was foiled only by accident, after Yousef fled the scene of a Manila \\"work accident\\" in December 1994, leaving behind a computer full of encrypted plans.<br />Emerson details his search through the U.S., to jihad academies in Florida and elsewhere. He includes excellent chapters on Hamas; Osama bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam and al-Qaeda; and an appendix exposing the American support these groups get through the Muslim Public Affairs Council, Islamic Circle of North America, American Muslim Council and, last but not least, the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Press pundits often and erroneously quote sources from these groups as \\"moderate.\\" They are no such thing.<br />More importantly, Emerson maps out plans by which Western governments and agencies can fight back.<br />Emerson was closely aided by Khalid Duran, whom Muslim terrorists have also threatened with death.

This phenomenon is not limited to our own age. For proof, look no further than this fanciful volume.<br />In 1917, Lowell Thomas was a 25-year-old part-time instructor at Princeton, a &quot;fledgling showman from Ohio who had knocked about North America in search of fame, fortune and adventure,&quot; according to historian David Fromkin (A Peace to End All Peace). Thomas then raised enough money to travel to Britain and the Middle East front as a World War I cameraman. With this coverage began the Lawrence of Arabia myth.<br />Thomas was &quot;in search of a salable story with romance and color,&quot; Fromkin writes. He found one in Lawrence, who dressed in Arab robes and lived with Arabs. Thomas altered the facts to meet his own mercenary needs.  Backed by the New York Globe, Thomas returned to New York with a false story of an Arab revolt he claimed had destroyed the Ottoman empire. At Century Theater in 1919, Thomas played a slide show and lecture, which soon moved to Madison Square Garden, then to London's Royal Opera House and Albert Hall. It eventually became With Lawrence in Arabia.<br />Unfortunately, many readers still accept as gospel the Lawrence of Arabia myth that stemmed largely from Lowell Thomas' hype. This was long ago debunked, along with critical points in Lawrence's own Seven Pillars of Wisdom, but not everyone seems to know it.<br />Fromkin writes that in 1920, when poet and scholar Robert Graves proposed to describe the liberation of Damascus, Lawrence himself warned Graves, &quot;I was on thin ice when I wrote the Damascus chapter....&quot; A onetime junior officer in the Cairo Arab Bureau, Lawrence admitted that Seven Pillars of Wisdom included a false tale of Arab bravery to aggrandize the followers of Sharif Hussein of Mecca and his son Feisal. As early as 1818, reputable newsmen reported that the Australian Light Horse division liberated Damascus from Ottoman control, not Feisal's Arab troops, who marched in afterwards, for show.<br />Efraim and Inari Karsh write (Empires of the Sand) that Lawrence's victory in Damascus was &quot;less heroic&quot; than he pretended: Feisal was &quot;engaged in an unabashed exercise in duplicity and none knew this better than Lawrence, who whole heartedly endorsed this illicit adventure and kept most of its contours hidden from his own superiors.&quot; Yet Lawrence basked in the limelight, attending at least five of Thomas' London lectures.<br />By 1921, Fromkin writes, Winston Churchill was in charge of Britain's Arab policy in Mesopotamia and tapped John Evelyn Shuckburgh to head a new Middle East department and Foreign Office man Hubert Winthrop Young to assist him. They arranged transport and supplies for Feisal's Arab army, earning hearty endorsement from Churchill's Masterson Smith committee, which simultaneously took grave exception to T.E. Lawrence as a proposed Arab affairs adviser. The committee considered Lawrence &quot;not the kind of man fit to easily fit into any official machine.&quot;<br />Fromkin reports that Lawrence was frequently insubordinate, went over his superiors and in 1920 publicly disparaged Britain's Arab policy in the London Sunday Times as being &quot;worse than the Turkish system.&quot; He also accused Britain of killing &quot;a yearly average of 100 Arabs to maintain peace.&quot; This was of course untrue. Those who want to know what really happened should consult A Peace to End All Peace and the Karsh's Empires of the Sand.<br />Clearly, With Lawrence in Arabia is well written. But Thomas took liberties, to say the least. William Carlos Williams and Archibald MacLeish, two of his contemporaries, became more famous as poets than as journalists. Yet unlike Thomas, they wisely kept poetic license out of their reporting. Alyssa A.

As explained in his afterward, he derived this superb tale of T'Shuva (repentance, or to be more precise, returning to a righteous path) from an early Hasidic legend of the Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer, who lived in Poland from 1700 to 1760 and was known as the Ba'al Shem Tov, or Master of the Good Name.<br /><br />Kimmel's ancestors came from that region, and he believes they knew him. Given his gift with story telling --- an art for which the Ba'al Shem Tov was also famous --- I can believe it. Not content, however, Kimmel also consulted work of the great 12th century Sephardic Rabbi, Moses Maimonides, known as the Ramban.<br /><br />Hershel sins every day many times, but he counts himself lucky each week to be able to sweep his ill deeds aside. At the end of the year, on Rosh Hashonah, he gathers them in a giant bag, takes them to the sea and tosses them in. Kimmel derives this colorful part of Gershon's annual routine from the Jewish tradition of Tashlikh, when people walk to lakes, rivers or any moving water to toss away their crumbs. This prayerful \\"casting off of sins,\\" concerns repentance and forgiveness.<br /><br />But Hershel does not take the exercise seriously. He drags his satchel of sins to the sea, and then returns to his old ways --- insulting people, forgetting to say Thank You, telling little untruths here and there. He even forgets to thank the Tzaddik, the holy man, whose prayers make it possible for his childless wife Fayge to bear twins. The Tzaddik warns him, though, that his bad habits will cause problems in a few short years.<br /><br />Sure enough, they do. Hershel's wife has beautiful twins, but all nearly comes to ruin. To discover how Hershel finds the path to T'Shuva and saves his family, indulge in this book brilliantly illustrated by Jon Muth. You and your children will treasure it.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

Some tell where the story is from--the Torah, Talmud, or rabbinic legends called Midrash and a bit about each tradition. Others tell fascinating background. Bet you didn't know that Herschel of Ostropol--whom Eric Kimmel has brought to life in a recent Chanukah goblin tale--was a real person, born in the Ukraine in the mid-18th century.<br />The stories themselves are short, but told as riddles. Each one thoroughly enthralls children from the beginning.<br />Take the Midrash about the Leviathan and the Fox, a tale about a small creature who dared to defy an enormous beast. The Leviathan, knowing the fox is clever, assumes that if he eats the latter he will be not only the strongest creature alive but also the most clever. Thus he sends the Swordfish and Sea Bass to find and bring the fox to him. They lure the fox to come with the false promise of a feast.<br />Of course, the fox cannot swim, and so the fish agree to carry him. Once he is on their backs at sea, they tell him the truth--that the Leviathan plans to make a meal of him. Now the story breaks, and the child is asked, if he were in the fox' place, what would he do? This is a tough one, and most children will not know (although there are other tales where they can easily guess the riddle). Alas, says the fox, I left my heart at home.  &quot;We foxes never travel with our hearts unless it is for a very important reason.&quot; He would hate to disappoint the Leviathan, and so the fishes take the fox back to shore. Whereupon the fox dances with joy and runs off. He has even escaped the Angel of Death, he tells them. &quot;Do you think I could be fooled by a couple of silly fish?&quot;<br />There are stories from famous sages--like Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav and Rabbi Hillel of ancient Palestine, the wise and patient teacher. One story hails from New York's Lower East Side, another from Chelm, that mythic town where God deposited all the fools, and still another from Eastern Europe's maggid (traveling preachers). The last of these involves a coachman who exchanges places with a great maggid of Lublin.<br />These stunning tales are perfect children who have begun to reach for big ideas, but still enjoy special read-aloud time with Mom or Dad. They provide endless joy and learning. Alyssa A.

Although Cohen's writing is fine, it offers little poetic value. But like other readers, I could not put the book down.<br /><br />This novel-like non-fiction offers many layers. The book opens with the author's discovery of his family and roots in Israel. Cohen's grandmother--one of nine siblings in Plosk, Poland--immigrated to America in 1920. The family intended for everyone to follow, but like so many poor Eastern European Jews, ran out of money. No one else was able to leave.<br /><br />Several years after World War II, Cohen's grandmother learned from a former Polish neighbor that nearly every Jew in Plosk had perished. But her eldest brother's daughter, Ruzka Korczak, had survived as a partisan in the forests near Vilna, fighting with Abba Kovner and Vitka Kempner. She was the only member of the family in Poland who survived.<br /><br />The book swiftly transports readers to the Vilna ghetto and a tale of survival and great courage. Shortly after Hitler and Stalin signed their non-aggression pact and German divisions flooded her area and town, Ruzka determined to move to Warsaw, where she hoped to meet the Zionist Youth Guard, HaShomer HaTza'ir. She planned to return to Plosk a few months later, when things calmed down. About 10 miles outside Warsaw, with the city in flames, she ran into a friend who told her HaShomir had moved to Vilna, in the Russian zone. She traveled three weeks to reach Bialystok and then crossed at night into Vilna, where shortly afterwards she met Vitka Kempner and Abba Kovner.<br /><br />At that time, 200,000 people lived in Vilna, a third of them Jewish. But the Jewish minority was heavily divided into factions--the communists, who distrusted Bundists, who distrusted Zionists, who distrusted Orthodox Jews. All of them distrusted assimilated Jews, and all feared the Soviet police, the NKVD.<br /><br />Threatened with arrest, Vitka fled Vilna, but returned weeks after the Nazis overtook both Vilna and her own location. On September 6, 1941, 30,000 Jews were forced into the Old Jewish Ghetto, where before only 1,000 had lived.<br /><br />By then, the Jewish people were gravely threatened. Abba Kovner hid in a nearby convent. But rumors of the murder of thousands in the forest of Ponar brought him back to Vilna, at Vitka's behest, to hear the story from a single survivor named Sara.<br /><br />At this dramatic juncture, Kovner realized that the Jewish people could escape only by battle. In December, 1941, he told fellow Ghetto residents that Ponar was a death trap and began to search for arms, an effort assisted by a former communist named Isaac Wittenberg, and Joseph Glassman. Together they located, bought and smuggled weapons into Vilna through the sewers, even obtaining grenades from the Mother Superior who had earlier hidden Kovner. Wittenberg was forced to surrender to the Nazis and committed suicide in prison.<br /><br />By 1943, the Germans were taking Jews from the Ghetto by increasing thousands and Kovner recognized that most would never return. He planned his escape, taking Vitka, Ruzka and others with him into the forests to fight. Leaving his mother was the hardest thing he had ever done. Her last words to him--\\"What will become of me?\\"-- forever rang in his ears.<br /><br />But Kovner put the survival of a few Jewish fighters above his family. When World War II was over, he went on fighting, alongside David Ben-Gurion, for his people's right to their ancient Jewish homeland of Israel.<br />Nowadays we sometimes use the word hero lightly. Kovner and two daring female fighters really earned the label: They helped to lead the Jewish people triumphantly out of the ashes into an era of rebirth.<br /><br />We owe Rich Cohen our gratitude for bringing these heroes once again to life.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

By then, he had already been drawing cartoons and illustrations for the New Yorker for 38 years. And it was by no means certain that his launch into children's books, where large numbers of titles die each year, would succeed.<br /><br />The late great New Yorker illustrator Arthur Getz, who in 50 years produced 213 of the magazine's covers, for example, created only four children's books, all of them now sadly out of print. But Steig became as prolific at children's books as he had been with adult humor.<br /><br />This book exemplifies the praise that critic James E. Higgins lavished on Steig in the first 1978 issue of Children's Literature in Education. He compared Steig to Isaac Bashevis Singer, E. B. White and select others whose work \\"reaches beyond the specific confines of a child audience.\\" Steig, he wrote, shows an unusual childlike capacity to present incidents of wonder as if they happened every day --- and an \\"essence of childhood which no adult can afford to give up or to deny.\\"<br /><br />The color and imagination in this 1969 volume places it at the pinnacle of Steig's children's collection. It reappeared in 1984 and again more recently. Unlike most of his children's books, the story offers no characters. Set in a boiling sea, the vile landscape that dominates it spouts fire, smoke, poison arrows, double-headed toads and hot lava. Even the plant life here sprouts horrible thorns and twisted spines. It thrives in an environment of hourly earthquakes, black tornadoes, lightening sprees, cyclones and dust storms, which freezes at night.<br /><br />The creatures inhabiting this place appear equally grotesque. The serpents, sharp-clawed crabs, stingrays, high-voltage electric eels and other scaly, wart-covered denizens sport talons, tentacles, fangs, extra arms and eyes, armor, rusty nails and wheels for legs. The insects appear bug-eyed and hairy, covered in grit and petrified sauerkraut. No two are alike --- except for their equal vanity, jealousy and delight in greeting one another with spit or shooting flames. Others' pain induces them to shake with laughter. Cruelty tickles them. They live in hatred --- hissing, screaming, caterwauling and otherwise venting their hideous feelings.<br /><br />Aside from showing children the hyperbolic worst likely to come of ill will and a venomous temper, what makes this book wonderful is the way in which this Paradise of hatred disintegrates and transforms into something beautiful.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

Before the list is over, kids are laughing.<br /><br />Next, they learn about that \\"area\\" inside our brains that \\"makes us think negative thoughts.\\" Here we meet the monster (a little green guy) from the title. He's determined to make us feel bad and he whispers into our ears, and the more we listen, the louder his voice gets. Before we know it, he's taking nibbles out of our self-esteem.<br /><br />About halfway through, the explaining leads to constructive exercises that children will also find funny--and therefore helpful.

It's a political tract on the supposed evils America has imposed on the world, which meanwhile ignores the immense good the U.S. has generated and the U.S. aid (food, health care, drugs, agricultural assistance, etc.) from which people around the globe benefit daily.<br /><br />Just as the book avoids discussing the victims of 9/11, it avoids the facts surrounding both the worst terrorist attack in world history and its perpetrators. Chomsky is uninterested in Bin Laden or the Islamic extremism that created him and his cohorts. According to this book, everything bad is America's fault.<br /><br />There are lots of errors, too. According to Chomsky, America's attack on a Sudanese \\"drug plant\\" --- which in reality produced biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction --- was calculated destruction of much-needed drug supplies for Sudan's beleaguered population. Yet, Chomsky ignores the Sudanese government's perpetuation of terror, genocide and enslavement against its south Sudanese black, animist and Muslim populations. If you are a humanist, please read [[ASIN:0863162592 Silent Terror]], [[ASIN:0312306245 Escape from Slavery]],[[ASIN:1576734595 Let My People Go]], and [[ASIN:0152024042 Dream Freedom]] for the details.<br /><br />But to Chomsky, U.S. policy must be considered in a vacuum --- where it is always, and can only be --- bad.<br /><br />Chomsky also repeats earlier falsehoods concerning U.S. support for Israel. Chomsky advises us to stop supporting a nation whose largely hostile neighbors have sought her destruction for [[ASIN:0671633104 56 years]].<br /><br />As for Iraq, while the war had not started when this book was written, Chomsky condemned U.S. sanctions, and ignored Saddam Hussein's ruthless mass murder of [[ASIN:0300064276 Iraq's Kurdish]] and other populations, or his orders that henchmen perpetrate [[ASIN:0451212924 mass rape]]. Subsequently, Chomsky did not care about the [[ASIN:0060588195 freedom relished]] by Iraq's masses after Hussein's defeat. Rather, his perspective lacks all balance.<br /><br />Presented as questions which the author purports to answer, this book requires readers to have a firm enough grasp of history to see through Chomsky's --- what can I say? --- creative historical reconstructions.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

In this magnificent collection, the Roma speak with a vibrant voice all their own.<br /><br />The book opens with a brilliant, if all-too-brief, introduction to Roma history by Dr. Ian Hancock, a Professor of Romany Studies at the University of Texas at Austin, who has made the study of the Rom migration, enslavement, literature, art and political life and sociology his life's work.<br /><br />The 44 poems that follow are ordered along a time line broken into sections and beginning with the Roma's departure from India with the first Ghaznavid raids in 997.<br /><br />Twenty-nine contemporary Romany poets, including editors Rajko Djuric, Siobhan Dowd and Dr. Hancock, created most pieces. But no collection of Rom poets would be complete without work from the renowned Papusza (Poland, c. 1910-1987) or Leksa Manus (Latvia, 1942-1997), each of whose work is also represented. The title comes from Manus' searing 38-line poem of the same name, which traces the countries and places the people have traveled after opening with these lines:<br /><br />\\"Each night, my God, before I close my eyes,<br /><br />I see before me the roads of the Roma.<br /><br />But where, my God, is the long lost road,<br /><br />The one true road, the first one traveled?\\"<br /><br />Roughly half the works were written in Romani, but according to Hancock seven Rom translators --- Dowd, Burton Bollag, Tom Fugalli, Ian MacAndless, Minna Proctor, Sinead ni Shuinear and Anika Weiss --- have remained faithful to the feel, heart and soul of the original works. I can believe it.<br /><br />Listen to these lines from Djura Makhotin's poem, \\"Give me a string to play on\\":<br /><br />\\"Oh my life is a silver mirror/<br />The years are its frame.<br /><br />\\"I cannot see the time ahead/<br />And what has passed I have forgotten./<br />In youth it seems every day is long,/<br />When one is older a year is like the breadth of a finger./<br />I am not guilty but I know the truth,/<br />The road of life leads me./<br />I am not sad, I swear an oath, give me a string to play on.\\"<br /><br />After hearing work from this book at a reading, I rushed to buy this book.

It was then translated into 18 languages, becoming what Eskin called \\"an international sensation.\\"<br /><br />However, as Eskin reports, before the book was published in English, the London Sunday Times ran an investigative report questioning its veracity. Gray had apparently minted money after the war by making European period furniture and selling it overseas as antique. Readers inferred that he had also manufactured his tale about being in Treblinka.<br /><br />That seemed to jibe with the facts: Inmates of the death factory launched hundreds of escape attempts, but usually ended dead. From 1942 to September 1943, when [[ASIN:0452011248 Treblinka]] was finally shuttered, 870,000 Jewish people were murdered there.<br /><br />The final attempt was planned for August 2, 1943, when the remaining prisoners became convinced that the camp would soon be liquidated. They smuggled arms to their barracks from the armory. Upon their discovery, they began shooting SS men and set the buildings on fire. Of 750 prisoners who attempted the final escape, only 70 survived to liberation.<br /><br />But, as Eskin reported, none of the survivors contacted by the London Sunday Times remembered Gray. The elaborate train station he described seeing on his reputed September 1942 arrival at Treblinka was actually constructed several months afterwards. \\"It was impossible to see the things Gray said he saw in Treblinka in the autumn of 1942,\\" one Treblinka survivor told The Times.<br /><br />Although Gray threatened to sue the Times, reiterating his claim to have been in Treblinka, according to Eskin, he never actually filed a complaint. Subsequently, as Eskin reported, Warsaw uprising survivors interviewed by The New Statesman similarly questioned Gray's \\"recollections.\\"<br /><br />Gray's French publisher, Editions Robert Laffont, refused to research the allegations, and the U.S. and U.K. publishers also published their editions--and, later, in paperback, which was followed by a film. Only the German publisher halted the presses pending its own research results.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Holocaust deniers widely herald this book as \\"proof\\" that first-person Holocaust accounts can't be trusted. If false, the story's author did a major disservice to millions of Holocaust victims--and the tens of thousands of survivors whose testimonies were unquestionably true and valid.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

He did not tell her why. Once Wiesenthal entered, Karl began a long tale of how he had come to this place, what he had done and why he wanted forgiveness. What Karl said and how Wiesenthal reacted are riveting. Years later, the latter traveled to Stuttgart to meet Karl's mother, yet did not tell her what he had learned about her son. I could have done no better in his place.<br />I found the details surrounding his encounter equally riveting. One day, Wiesenthal was ordered to join a concentration camp work detail that hiked into the town of Lemberg, where he had attended Technical High School in Sapiehy Street. By coincidence, the guards brought the enslaved men through the streets he had once walked as a free young man, to the very building where he had attended school. As he walked, he thought of events, both recent ones in the camp and more distant events in Lemberg and at his school. He recounts them all.<br />Readers also learn of Wiesenthal's friends Arthur and Josek, neither of whom survived, who comforted and consoled one another and him, talking philosophically under the most inhuman circumstances in order to maintain their humanity.<br />The reactions of various famed writers, religious leaders and others are less important. Some are nevertheless compelling by virtue of their authorship or unique content. These include replies by Holocaust survivors Jean Amery, Moshe Bejske, Abraham Joshua Heschel, Primo Levi and Nechana Tec, two of whom later committed suicide, and Rabbi Lawrence Kushner. I was especially struck by Theologian Franklin H. Littell's call for increased awareness &quot;of the earnest nature of the choice between good and evil, between innocence and guilt.&quot;<br />This book has been important for 25 years.

Also included is the Hamas charter, the Palestine National Council  political resolution and declaration of independence of 1988 and Iraqi speech of Saddam Hussein as well as a 1991 U.S. letter of assurance to the Palestinians.<br />The Israel-Arab Reader's last section includes many Arab documents on Oslo and runs through 2001 statements by the Palestinian negotiating team and former President Bill Clinton.<br />It is hard to argue against reading important original documents, and forming your own opinion.

As Fonseca tells us, Papusza wrote a long autobiographical ballad about hiding in the forests during World War II--&quot;Bloody Tears: What We Went Through Under the Germans in Volhynia in the Years 43 and 44.&quot; Discovered by the Polish poet Jerzy Ficowski in 1949, Papusza also wrote of the Jewish experience and &quot;the vague threat of the gadjikane&quot; (non-Gypsy) world.&quot; But her 1987 death in Poland, where she had lived most of her life, went unnoticed.<br />That is an appropriate beginning, for this book is not academic anthropology--and it more than admirably explains, from the Roma point of view, what it means to live in a world that remains largely threatening to the Roma. The book is not uniformly complimentary. But Fonseca lived for a period with Roma families, learned their separate and distinct Romany language, traveled across Eastern Europe with them, observed the poverty-stricken ghettos and mud hovels in which the poorest made their beds. And one finds in her closeness to them a sympathy altogether lacking in many other works.<br />Fonseca writes of her own extensive experience, of course, but also refers to more than 140 scholars, including the fine work of Rom professor Ian Hancock and Jan Yoors. The latter likewise lived among Roma, albeit during the pre-war and World War II eras. She recounts the likely path that the Roma traveled from India to Europe, their centuries of enslavement, their high rate of illiteracy (and cultural reasons for it), their experience during the Holocaust, which the Roma appropriately term the Devouring--and the new generation of Rom leaders who hope to lead their people to a more productive and accepted role in European and world society.<br />For anyone who has ever wondered about the Rom--especially those wanting a portrait that moves beyond the stereotypes of literature and music like Carmen--this is a fine place to begin.

This work is shot through with memories of his life before, during and after the war and references to many of the thinkers and writers he has known. Passages as delicate as lace adorn chapters sound as bedrock. You could do much worse than to build a set of Holocaust readings on this foundation.<br />One aspect making this an especially vibrant Holocaust testimony is that Semprun is not Jewish. While he approaches the subject of Jewish suffering with sympathy, gravity and deep respect, his reminiscences are framed by a lifetime of learning and an important non-Jewish perspective.  Readers taste the suffering Semprun has experienced through continuing memories and glimpse what must have driven celebrated Jewish survivors like Paul Celan, Primo Levi and Tadeusz Borowski to suicide.<br />Another laudable feature is Semprun's sure knowledge that in politics, as in everything, there is such a thing as paramount Evil, to which philosophers like Heidegger contributed. Deep thinking alone does not, according to his view, constitute righteousness. Semprun elegantly examines ends and means as well as thought processes, dramatically dismissing the moral relativism common among intellectuals these days.<br />Despite the difficult subject matter, I found this work highly educational--and eminently hopeful and uplifting.

Charles on the other hand preferred chasing chickens, poking in anthills and arguing with the family goat.<br />Naturally, when their parents traveled to a distant wedding, Yorick got into some solution. &quot;Yes goosewit,&quot; he told his brother, after transmogrificating himself, &quot;I invented a new potion. But I tasted it and za-zing! I was no bigger than a cockroach.&quot;<br />Charles found his older brother's new size satisfyingly real as peas and beans and built him a new pint-sized house, but when it started to hail, he realized that Yorick would always be in danger. He could easily drown in a bucket of milk, be eaten by a cat, seriously injured by a field mouse or stepped on by a donkey.<br />Steig mixed unusual words with more unusual ingredients--putting gadzooks and flabbergasted with borage, betony, camphor, sauerkraut and dainty pies.

(Lanzmann this week won Israel's highest cinematic honor for his film). It should.<br /><br />As Richard Rashke noted in his 1982 introduction, even then almost no one had ever heard of Sobibor, although it had been the scene of the biggest prisoner escape in World War II, on October 14, 1943 at 4 p.m. Why? Millions of pages of Nazi records included only three documents on Sobibor--like Treblinka and Belzec, a top secret death factory. These 3 places, unlike Auschwitz and Dachau and thousands of other camps, had no satellite labor camps.<br /><br />Here, virtually everyone was sent immediately to their deaths. The handful of survivors were those enslaved to process transports. Even these laborers, if they did not die of exhaustion or starvation, were largely murdered after a very short while.<br /><br />Poland's pre-glasnost Commission for German War Crimes estimated that the Nazis gassed at minimum 1.65 million Jews (25% of all those murdered in the Holocaust) in these three camps alone--250,000 of them at Sobibor, which Rashke called Heinrich Himmler's \\"best-kept secret.\\"<br /><br />This book was perhaps the first lengthy expose of such a place. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Rashke interviewed 18 of Sobibor's 30 survivors, who warmly welcomed his inquiries because he is not Jewish. He interviewed escape co-leaders Alexander (Sasha) Perchersky (in the Soviet Union) and Stanislaw (Shlomo) Szmajner (in Brazil) and spoke for more than 10 days with Thomas (Toivi) Blatt, who survived Sobibor for six months and made it his business to know everything about that hell. Rashke's subjects also included Chaim and Selma Engel in the U.S. and Eda and Itzhak Lichtman in Israel.<br /><br />What resulted from this extensive research was not any old oral history. Rashke made a valiant and largely successful attempt to check and cross check all the information he was given. The book contains 335 footnotes and an extensive bibliography including many primary sources.<br /><br />But this is high drama, not academic work, the more so because many of the survivors are still (even now) living.

She was a very nosy sort of person, always talking. When she got tired of addressing her walls and chairs, she went and talked to others.<br /><br />Now Tillie Schnitzele the dressmaker couldn't make a living, what with Yettele telling everyone she purposely made dresses too small. And no one would eat Goldie Pishkin's chicken soup any more, because Yettele had said she added sawdust to her matzah balls. Then she saw Yussel Farfel take an apple from the fruit stand and before long the story had spread that he stole a whole bag of apples. He nearly lost his job at the butcher's shop.<br /><br />Soon no one would talk to Yettele any more, so she was forced to see the rabbi with an especially interesting tidbit about Moishe Mushnik's shoe. \\"Some people might be hurt by your stories,\\" he said.<br /><br />\\"What harm can come from a word?\\" she asked. \\"Certainly no more harm than from a feather.\\"<br /><br />Offering help, the rabbi advised his errant congregant to take a feather pillow, cut off its top, and bring it to him. But when she got outside with the pillow, the wind arose and grabbed the feathers, casting them about. She finally got hold of the near-empty pillow and arrived at the rabbi's door, covered in down.<br /><br />\\"Go out and find all the feathers,\\" he advised her next.<br /><br />The rabbi used the feathers, of course, to teach Yettele a lesson. You'll have to buy the book to find out exactly what that was. Based on a story told by Rabbi Dennis Math, this tale amuses children. Parents should be happy with it too.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

But always somehow magically appeared whenever trouble emerged. To a beggar who came to town, Schmuel gave free and to a fierce bear which arrived in the streets, he gave a bowl of water.<br /><br />No one cared if he prayed, because they figured he was too stupid to read, and God could therefore not hear them. When, during a drought everyone prayed for rain and none came, Schmuel meekly said from the rear of the synagogue, \\"Maybe I should pray. Please, God, send rain.\\" Immediately, distant thunder roared, the sky blackened and huge raindrops began tapping on the town's roofs.<br /><br />It rained for forty days and forty nights. Now the people prayed for the rain to stop, with equal success. Only when Schmuel said, \\"God, please make it stop raining\\" did the sun immediately appear.<br /><br />That night the rabbi dreamed of Chanukah menorahs with 36 candles, and a banquet with 36 men.

Volney, Mark Twain, Edward Robinson (1841) and British consul James Finn (1878). But Idinopulos also turns to other primary and secondary sources, including the 1854-59 German writings (still untranslated) of Ulrich Seetzen, who traveled the Middle East disguised as an Arab.<br />In the earliest chapters, Idinopulos confirms an important conclusion of Avneri and Peters--that a large Arab migration into Palestine followed the Jewish immigration that began in about 1870. He also notes that thousands of Jews previously lived in the land, and that Palestine was otherwise largely, though not completely, desolate. More than two thirds of the land west of the Jordan River was desert and swamp, including much of the coastal Sharon plain and the interior. Less than a third of it was fertile. Except for a few wealthy landed Muslim families, inhabitants were unlanded and conditions terrible.<br />Travelers were routinely attacked by Bedouin thieves. The Ottomans overtaxed everyone, adding for Jews and Christians special dhimmi &quot;protection&quot; taxes.&quot; Epidemics of Bubonic Plague, malaria and cholera were common.<br />Idinopulos, however, did not consult the rich Turkish, Jordanian, Egyptian, Russian or other sources used by Efraim and Inari Karsh in Empires of the Sand. That major drawback naturally limits and skews some conclusions.<br />For example, his map of the Palestine Mandate does not show land east of the Jordan River, although the Mandate included all of current-day Jordan, which Britain unilaterally ceded to the Emir Abdullah in 1922. Idinopulos breezes through this point, attributing its sole importance to political relations between the left-wing labor Zionists and right-wing Revisionists. Its significance was far greater than that.<br />In an unfootnoted passage, he also reports that in correspondence with King Faisal, Britain's Henry McMahon promised the Arabs domination over Palestine. This is the Arab view, adopted years after the 1915 correspondence.<br />Efraim and Inari Karsh and David Fromkin give a sharply different picture: McMahon felt he gave no such assurance, and the Karshes substantially document that Faisal knew it. Isaiah Friedman supports them, with translations of the original correspondence, in Palestine: A Twice Promised Land? Among the strongest evidence is Faisal's signature on a 1919 treaty with Chaim Weizman--agreeing that Palestine, including Jordan, was to be a national home for the Jews. Idinopulos omits that important treaty from his history.<br />We do learn that the Jewish people acquired land by legitimate purchases, often at above-market prices and that Arabs who complained of Jewish immigration &quot;in the darkness of night were selling land to the Jews.&quot; British refusal to invest exacerbated problems, just as Ottoman tax laws had done. But while Zionist-induced prosperity increased the Arab population markedly, Arab violence also increased. Intense Arab inter-factional fighting was in part encouraged by Britain, by empowering Jerusalem Mufti Hajj Amin el-Husseini, had given power to the most uncompromising and divisive of Arab forces.<br />In 1937, the Peel Commission recommended a partition and population transfers like those that had occurred with the Greeks and Turks after their 1922 war. The Arabs rejected the plan because it allowed for a Jewish state, and in 1939, Britain attempted to appease the Arabs by cutting off Jewish immigration.<br />The early chapters are worth reading for the fine writing and detail.

(...)<br />You may hear various complaints that is a one-sided pro-Israel account. It is unquestionably pro-Israel, but not one-sided. Take the 40-page chapter on refugees, one of the highlights of this superb volume. Its 80 footnotes run for almost three pages--and 25 Arab sources include nine original Arab newspaper articles, several Arab authors and studies by Bir Zeit University.<br />The refugee chapter begins with the myth that one million Palestinians were expelled form Israel in 1947 through 1949, and then counters that myth with evidence including the 1949 Armistice agreement and United Nations reports of the day. In fact, the Arab census of 1945 found 1.2 million Arabs in all of Palestine, but only 809,100 within the boundaries of what became Israel. A 1949 Israeli census found 160,000 Arabs inside Israel, which meant that no more than 650,000 Palestinian Arabs could have become refugees. But the United Nations Mediator on Palestine at that time put the figure at only 472,000. Much similar material fills this rich reference.<br />The volume's sourcing is impeccable; All those books sited that I own, I can report first hand, are irreproachable pieces of scholarship.<br />In addition to the chapters on everything from Jewish settlements, Jerusalem and human rights in the territories to the arms balance, U.S. Middle East policy, the peace process and Holocaust denial, you will find complete copies of many of the major documents that govern Israel and its relationship with Arab states and the PLO entity.

In this 21-page rendition of Chelm, that mythic town in Eastern Europe where all the people were fools, she introduces their most classic foibles.    When the man who woke the people every morning for prayers got too old to walk from house to house, they took their doors off the hinges and carried them to him so he could knock without leaving his yard. The people went barefoot in the snow so their shoes wouldn't get wet. They wore their hats upside down when it rained to keep them dry.    They built their new synogogue without a roof so their prayers could rise to heaven. They tried to move the mountain to remove their town from shadow. They tried to catch the moon and store it in a barrel. And when a fire broke out, they threw on logs to smother it. Needless to say, it burned higher.    This book has none of the character development or pithy dialogue of other Chelm volumes, but Mark Podwal's illustrations more than make up, in pictures, for the hallmark word-play of Chelm.	2001-12-11

Judy Lash Balint provides an excellent internet email service through which many of these essays originally appeared.<br /><br />Here one finds the frustrations of daily life in Israel, what it means to live under the siege of a people whose leaders refuse to recognize your nation's very right to exist, whose school books and clerics call for your expulsion and death. The book shows what it means to travel in buses that are fired upon daily, to travel to several funerals of terror victims within a few days, to drive the terrorized road from Modi'in to Jerusalem, to live under nightly fire in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Gilo. It provides the Israeli perspective rarely given in the news, how deeply Israelis desire peace--and why.<br /><br />Israelis are bleeding. There have been more than 600 Israeli victims of terrorism since the Oslo accords were signed--mothers, fathers, children, infants, teachers, rabbis. Proportionately, that would equal 25,000 in the U.S. When you finish this book, you will understand their humanity, and wonder why the Western press corps almost never shows that Israelis are people, too often denied their most basic right --- the right to life --- because they are Jews.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

He wrote You Gentiles some 20 years after the Protocols of Zion was forged and began to spread its evil; You Gentiles was reprinted five times within eight months, and has now tragically become a cult book for anti-Semites. Such readers would be shocked by what Samuel said here, for he made an assertion no less startling today than it must have been in 1940: \\"Anti-Semitism is the expression of the concealed hatred of Christ and Christianity, rising to a new and catastrophic level in the western world.\\"<br /><br />Anti-Semitism, Samuel wrote, cannot be properly understood as a common bigotry. Despite comparisons to racial, religious, economic or political discrimination, it rather \\"invokes a proliferating diabolism which testifies to a kind of insanity.\\" Other kinds of prejudice involve ordinary statistical inaccuracies and lies, he wrote, but anti-Semitism makes the Jew \\"the subject of a new and horrible mythology. Therefore, while reminding you that it is sinful and anti-Christian to hate anyone, I charge you to look into the disintegration of the mind which is part of your anti-Semitism and of your anti-Semitism alone, and discover, if it is not too late, what special spiritual disaster it indicates.\\"<br /><br />Samuel wrote as Hitler launched his diabolical truculence on the world. But he rightly found fault not only with Nazi Germans. Anti-Semitism sprouted in all countries of the world, \\"the 'haves,' the 'have nots,' the sated and the unsated, those which were victorious in the first world war, those which were vanquished, those which remained neutral and even those which were born of it.\\" Wherever fascist groups arose--and he listed Italy's and England's blackshirts, Germany's brownshirts, Romania's and Hungary's greenshirts, America's silver-shirts and South Africa's greyshirts--they \\"made the Jew their primary psychic preoccupation, with the same psychic manifestations.\\" Hate literature exemplified by the Protocols of Zion then circulated everywhere. Were Samuel alive today (he died at 77 in 1972) he would undoubtedly have included fascist Islamists as well.<br /><br />Samuel placed \\"this lunatic concentration on the Jews\\" at fascism's core. Wherever fascism emerged, it manifested a fierce, religious anti-Semitic urge. Even in countries with few Jews, anti-Semitism eventually found expression. He cited Spain and Italy as examples, but today Iraq, Iran, Syria and Egypt would serve as well. Fascism could drop its common bigotries, Samuel posited, but it could never drop its anti-Semitism.<br /><br />The dehumanization he observed in Hitler's fascism also appeared in the Islamist fascists whose ferocious sense of \\"rightness\\" legitimized murdering thousands of civilians on September 11. In 1940, children were seduced into mob moods in kindergarten and school, as they are in fascist states again now. In a \\"gigantic but fine-woven web\\" that caught citizens' minds \\"at every level, building up a world of fantasy incomprehensible to those who live outside the controlled area,\\" Samuel observed darkly that the science of dehumanizing man was still in its infancy.<br /><br />Samuel identified threads of this anti-Judeo-Christian disease in Friedrich Nietzsche's 1887 Genealogy of Morals, which referred to the Jews' supposedly inferior \\"terrifying logic\\" based in what the German philosopher disparagingly labeled \\"the teeth of the most profound hatred (the hatred of weakness),\\" namely that the Jewish slaves Moses freed were equal to other men. Samuel found similar anti-Jewish pathology in the work of Augustus Henry Pitt-Rivers, the British Crimean war general and archaeologist, who complained that \\"Jewish mendicants\\" had extinguished the culture of Rome and \\"Judaised the whole of Europe.\\"<br /><br />But Hitler, who condemned the Jews for opposing \\"the eternal privilege of force and strength,\\" gave the plainest voice to the hatred of Christianity inherent in anti-Semitism. Fascism, Samuel wrote, \\"says that man exists in and by virtue of the machine; Judeo-Christianity says that a machine must exist for man, or must not exist at all. And everyone who takes this point of view allies himself ultimately with Judeo-Christianity.\\"<br /><br />Fascists, Samuel concluded, must \\"spit on the Jews as 'the Christ-killers' because they long to spit on the Jews as the Christ-givers.\\" He saw their belief in Jewish ritual murder as a resurrection of old stories of Christians eating human babies at secret feasts and their mad belief in terrific Jewish power as a mirror of Him whose name caused the ancient Pagan world to collapse. Thus does Judeo-Christian tradition continue to threaten fascists. And in an accidental way, he wrote, fascists rightly feared the Jewish capacity to produce anti-fascist types and philosophies, for the Jewish people had learned Christian doctrines and practices from the same sources as Jesus, though by different channels.<br /><br />The struggle between fascism's ethic of force and Judeo-Christian ethics of man-to-man relationships countenanced no neutrality. In the former, Samuel believed words took the blunt form of weapons and ultimately lost all meaning. In the latter, words served as peaceful instruments, ultimately providing a path to sanctity.<br /><br />Samuel wrote that the fact that the Judeo-Christian non-force philosophy possesses mythological power over the souls of men--an omnipresence that pursues and persecutes worshippers of force, constituting a sort of universal anti-fascist conspiracy--renders the world ever-susceptible to demonizing the Jewish people.<br /><br />Fascists transfer to living Jews \\"all the attributes of the Judeo-Christian episode in human history,\\" concealing from themselves the fact of this transference.

But, by adopting anti-Semitism as an ideal, the force philosophy can, and still does, assume the objective of destroying Christ and Christianity's significance and values, via those identified as their creators and representatives.     In 1939, a leading American liberal writer, who repented a year later, wrote that Britain's non-aggression pacts had caused \\"denial of legitimate German aspirations\\" and spoke of the German Reich's right to \\"self-determination\\" and the need to \\"rectify injustice.\\" Samuel attributed this grotesque confusion with the liberal world's inability to denounce the dread purpose behind German's ostensible demands. Sound familiar?    It would be funny, if it were not so tragic, how history repeats. Alyssa A. Lappen	2001-12-03

He fell asleep over his unread book the night before his report was due.<br /><br />Elmo woke up feeling sick, and no wonder--his feet were green and webbed.<br /><br />He called the author, Dr. Frank Galoof, for advice and found a cab outside his apartment building that spirited him--actually floated--to Frogtown, where Dr. Galoof said it was no wonder he was turning into a frog. Lunch in a swamp-colored restaurant, where the waiters were frogs like the good Dr. and the fare consisted of slugs and insects, Galoof told poor Elmo,<br /><br />\\"You see, the longer you put a problem off, the worse it becomes. It's all in my book.\\" Elmo replied, \\"I had no idea frogs led such interesting lives.\\"<br /><br />Elmo took the advice--\\"Just read the book\\"--and liked it! Everything, even his feet, returned to the everyday.<br /><br />Kids absolutely love the froggy, swamp-bottom illustrations and clever language and dialogue in this special creation. It's much better than the books that Roy Plumpton or Arthur Flax chose--Common Household Monsters or The Lost Dinosaurs of Terror Island.<br /><br />From a grown-up's point of view, the best thing about this treasure is that the medicine--READ--goes down with a spoonful of sugar.

This book is one of them, and does it in style.<br />Even little kids understand the consequences here, because the ripple effect is illustrated so well. Andrew's older sister ran to answer the phone, tripping Andrew and spilling him and his toys in the process. He then spewed &quot;the angriest bunch of words anyone has ever heard.&quot;<br />As soon as he said them, he wished he had not. But it was too late. Marion got on the phone with Ted, the baker's son, and yelled at him, who yelled out the window and into a room where a poet was working. The poet lost his rhyme, and screamed angry words at a motorcyclist passing by. And so on.<br />The words went to some fanciful places, including a dragon's breath, but kids get the message: Once spoken, ephemeral though words seem, they have a way of traveling.<br />The story ends on a happy note, the happiest part of which is that kids finish this book understanding the hurtful potential--and positive power--of words.

It also shows photographs of real adoptive parents who cannot bear children of their own, who desperately want children.<br />And it introduces the idea that adults have often been adopted too. One child in this book tells his teacher that he was adopted, and the teacher confides that she too was adopted as a child.<br />Altogether this book provides a great introduction to the beauty of adoption as a way to build a family.

Those with poor sight are often labeled &quot;blind as a bat&quot; but the simple fact is that these small animals do have eyes and several species (like the flying foxes) see well, thank you very much. So what do they do when their echolocation &quot;sees&quot; one thing and their eyes tell them something different? What role does color play?<br />This book is filled with neat information, scientific questions, and gorgeous color photographs that kids will love. The book is divided into seven chapters on everything from the basic lure of bats, their auditory &quot;vision&quot; and what they eat to where they live, how they look and how to conserve them.<br />The rich photographs show all kinds of fruit, insect-eating and vampire bats, feeding and in their roosts all over the world.<br />The book closes with four brief sections on bat classifications, anatomy, scientific and common names, and other books and technical publications about bats.<br />The type is fairly large, and the text is both scientific easy enough for independent readers aged 10 and up.<br />For kids who like nonfiction or nature this book is a must.

It also destroyed the library from which, a year earlier, a Jesuit priest had retrieved an original copy of the 1946 publication, in Di Yiddishe Tsaytung, of Zvi Kolitz' Yosl Rakover Talks to God.<br />This is but one of many fascinating details in Paul Badde's 1994 essay on Zvi Kolitz and the separate and mythological life that his 25-page short story took on after its 1946 appearance. One of Badde's friends had searched fruitlessly for the story after reading a 1963 essay about it by the great philosopher Emmanuel Levinas. He finally found a yellowing copy in the Munich State Library, in German, which had been translated by Anna Maria Jokl in 1954. Zvi Kolitz' story is almost as great as Yosl Rakover's monologue.<br />Isaac Bashevis Singer, before he died, called the fictional tale about a participant in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising a &quot;story of a Jew possessed by his faith as if by a Dybbuk.&quot; It similarly came to the attention of George Steiner and the theologian Klaus Beger. One can read the story in less than an hour. But it is so great that it was believed for years to have been the work of an actual victim of the Warsaw Ghetto.<br />This book, though short, carries great weight. It is a gift to all serious readers. Alyssa A. Lappen	2001-11-25

Like all the sections, this one opens with a description of the holidays and their spiritual significance. Next comes a biblical story of Moshe's mistake, whose epigraph explains that there is no Hebrew word for sin. &quot;Het&quot; (pronounced with a guttural &quot;ch&quot;) actually means &quot;to miss the mark.&quot;<br />One of these is the tale of Zuzya, adapted from the Yiddish genius, I.L. Peretz. When Zuzya missed prayers, the villagers claimed he was speaking to God. A stranger laughed. The next day, he followed Zuzya as he dressed as a peasant, walked to the woods, gave an old widow wood and lit her hearth comforting her with the assurance that God would provide her funds to pay him later. The section also gives recipes for honey cake and challah, explains the Shofar blasts, and recounts the Torah portion from Yom Kippur afternoon--the story of Jonah and the great fish.<br />The Sukkot section explains significance of the harvest festival, the booth (open to the sky) that must be built to mark it and the 4 plant species that help to celebrate the feast. Readers are treated to a story for Sukkot from Chelm, the realm of fools; one on invisible guests and the importance of hospitality; and a short David Adler tale of a city family whose landlord objects to their hut on the apartment building roof. Two entries on Simchat Torah follow a recipe for stuffed pumpkin.<br />For Chanukah, readers will find the music and words to Maoz Tzur (Rock of Ages), a recipe for potato pancakes (latkes), the rules for a game of dreidel--and a delightful Isaac Bashevis Singer tale, Zlateh the Goat.<br />The remaining sections are each as rich as the first three. The Tu B'Sh'vat (birthday of trees) section includes a Midrashic tale, Honi and the Carob Tree and a story by Janice May Udry. Purim features a play and a story from Sadie Rose Weilerstein on K'tonton, the Jewish Tom Thumb. Pesach (Passover) includes stories about Moses, the Jewish flight from slavery in Egypt and its significance for every Jew today, and Barbara Cohen's modern-day classic, The Carp in the Bathtub.<br />Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust remembrance day, features the most famous entry from Anne Frank's diary and the famous Hannah Senesh poem, Eili, Eili. It is followed by a moving section on Yom Ha'atzmaut, Israel Independence Day, including Brothers, a story on Jewish flight from the Nazis by Shalom Hetkin.<br />The book closes with a delightful section on most important Jewish holiday of all, Shabbat.

You can tell from his beginning, a master's parody of Genesis.<br />&quot;The pious believed that God said, 'Let there be Chelm.' And there was Chelm. But many scholars insisted that the town happened as the result of an eruption.<br />&quot; 'Before Chelm,' they said, 'the area was one huge chaos, all fog and mist. Then came a great explosion and Chelm appeared.<br />&quot;At the beginning the surface of Chelm was so hot that even if Chelmites had already existed, they could not have walked on the earth because they would have burned their feet.&quot; The first Chemites, this version goes, were not people but microbes, amoebas and other such creatures. When people finally arrived in town, they had names like Gronam the First, aka Gronam Ox, and Dopey Lekisch, Zeinvel Ninny, Treitel Fool and Shmendrick Numskull. And they practically invented problems.<br />One of the biggest was that the people of nearby Gorshkov called the Chelmites fools. Gronam Ox told his compatriots, &quot;We Chelmites know that, of the ten measures of wisdom sent down to earth from heaven, nine went to Chelm. But the conceited people of Gorshkov think they are the clever ones and we are the fools.&quot; What does he propose? Why making war, of course.<br />Needless to say, the Chelmnicks end up in the wrong place, a God-forsaken town called Mazelborsht (translation: luck soup). Defeated by their own foolishness, they returned to Chelm half naked, weaponless and with broken noses and black eyes. This produced the expected seven days and seven nights of contemplation which resulted in four sage proclamations.<br />Next the Chelmites abolished money, decided to hold elections once every 40 years, asked Zeckel Poet to compose a hymn of 12,000 lines which schoolchildren must learn by heart and appoint Shlemeil secretary. Of course, the merchants refused to part with their goods for nothing, which resulted in a system of barter in which Zeckel Poet was the most eager participant, followed by Shmoyger the matchmaker, Fultsha Jester and the Chelm band. Nothing was exchanged.<br />To discover what became of Singer's Chelm, you'll have to exchange some abolished currency for this masterwork, which contains much hilarity.

Then the magic begins. The sand-fairy does not like granting wishes, and his misshapen body with bat's ears and snail's eyes bloats when he does. The wishes, lasting only until sunset, all take unexpected, funny turns.<br />The sand-fairy and other personalities and Victorian details render the magic entirely real-world, believable. This was my favorite children's book and I relived the delight when I found a copy to share with my own children. That this volume is illustrated by one of my favorite people from one of my favorite families triples the delight.<br />The book is too challenging for independent reading for children under 10, but it's a great read-aloud for small children, as are the classics of Frank Baum, E.B. White and C.S. Lewis.<br />Edith Nesbit was like J. K. Rowling a single mother in need of a means to support her children. Her books in their era were as popular as Harry Potter in this one.

That may be why he is particularly adept at telling these eight delights from Chelm, one for each night of the Festival of Lights.<br />Now Chelm, as you may know, is the mythical town of fools somewhere in Eastern Europe. And every book of Chelm stories offers a different explanation of how they got there, usually involving God, angels--and a giant slip-up. Kimmel's variation ascends to the level of Isaac Bashevis Singer (who also wrote magnificent tales for children), maybe because he retells a Yiddish version of the story.<br />Kimmel has a neat way of taking stories from one tradition and mixing them with others, a feat he pulls off with aplomb in three of these tales. I especially like Berel Dunce and Motke Fool in The Magic Spoon, a Chelm rendition of Stone Soup.<br />He can also magically pull original stories out of thin air, as he does here with three Chelmnick firsts. One, The Soul of the Menorah, introduces us to the menorah at the Grand Synogogue of Chelm, with a blessing from the Seer of Lublin himself.<br />It came to Chelm, many years ago, on the back of a hay wagon, in the shape of a hay fork. Anyone who dared to question that God threw it down from heaven was greeted with the rejoinder, &quot;Dolt! Mooncalf! Since when does a hay fork shine like silver?&quot;<br />Sparks of holiness can be found in the most common, ordinary things, the Rabbi of Lublin told the people of Chelm. &quot;A blind beggar singing in the marketplace might be an angel. An old boot may hold the key to a cosmic riddle. We must constantly search for the hidden sparks so that we can uncover their true holiness.&quot;<br />Maybe these Chelmnicks are no fools. After all, they were smart enough to let Kimmel bind their wisdom between the covers of this book, and offer it for sale. Trust me, this book is rich. (But then, I never met a Chelmnick I didn't like.) Alyssa A. Lappen	2001-11-20

But I could not understand when she said this was what she had lived her whole life to write. Then I read the book.<br />This autobiographical novel of family resilience distills many truths that obviously took a lifetime to learn--truths that melt bitterness.<br />The book weaves several layers together--a of a family's travails, its near ruin in a tangle of poverty, bad decisions and relationships gone sour; a soul's awakening; and family renewal. The poetry of all three resonates throughout in a voice as subtle and profound as it is sensible.<br />Ragen has given few details when she notes that readers will all feel sure that their &quot;own knowledge would have kept you safe,&quot; and then warns, &quot;Of course, you'd be fooling yourself.&quot;<br />Poetry comes in what follows: &quot;It is a false security, that feeling of superiority we have listening to someone else recount the steps to personal disaster because all of us are so very similar--we humans. We feel safe only because the teller is untalented, the truth unconveyed. And so, you must consider the soft building dust underfoot, the newness of the place.&quot;<br />One can only relish Ragen's description, some time later, of a child discovering the value of her own life. &quot;She dropped to her knees, breathless, aware of her own heart pounding like some stranger begging to be let in.... She lay down in the sand. First she wiggled her toes, feeling the air pass through them like the cold touch of metal. She felt a strong sudden consciousness of her ankles and the firm muscles of her calves, the long wonderful stretch of skin, so smooth and soft, that ran from her toes to her hips. She felt aware of her stomach and the softly beating heart in her chest and her mouth and her nose and eyes and ears.<br /> &quot;A nameless joy began to rise inside her, wavelike. She felt it spread, as a wave of breaks and spreads, touching the far-off shore, flooding the sand in a quick deliberate flood. A sudden searing light, like the sun, pierced what had been dark and cold and filled with fear.<br />&quot; 'I'm alive!' she thought, and was comforted.&quot;<br />Have we not all been in that place? The same child still later astonishes herself and readers with her discovery of her soul and place in the universe. The sense of discovery alone makes this wise novel worth reading. But the book also rewards readers with intense optimism, even when its characters are at their lowest.<br />With the same poetry that the book opens, it closes: &quot;The echoes moved out of the corners, beating like wingless birds around the room.&quot;<br />I cannot recommend this book or author highly enough.

Unfortunately, as she heads up the slope with her skis, the trolls hiding in the mountain begin harassing her and her pet. Treva dangles her clothing before the trolls to distract them from Tuffi.<br /><br />By the time Treva and Tuffi reach Mount Baldy's peak, however, the trolls have grabbed her mittens, her hat, her sweater, her boots--and they still want Tuffi, into the bargain.

The board member of Israel's hard left B'tselem proposes, instead, to impose the terms from Ehud Barak's 2000 Camp David failed offer of peace.<br /><br />Klein recounts points of contention from the 1977 Egyptian-Israeli talks on Palestinian Arab autonomy through the 1993 Oslo Accords to the Barak-Arafat talks at Camp David II. Against the evidence, he concludes that Israel and the Palestinians have \\"moved closer\\" to peace. That would be news, if it were true.<br /><br />But Jerusalem remained a sticking point at the first of these conferences. At Camp David II, Ehud Barak seriously proposed to share sovereignty over Jerusalem--which would have given Palestinians most of the Old City, including the Temple Mount. Klein forgets that Arafat violently rejected that offer, sans counter-proposal, and has pursued war ever since.<br /><br />An addendum to the Oslo Accords' Declaration of Principles officially put Jerusalem in play, including the city among items to be negotiated in permanent status talks. Then Foreign Minister Shimon Peres wrote an infamous letter to his Norwegian counterpart --- a sort of secret codicil to the Declaration of Principles --- in which he stated that the \\"Palestinian institutions of East Jerusalem... are of great importance.\\"<br /><br />Klein surveys massive amounts of data on Jerusalem and those seeking to influence its fate. But he jumbles and misrepresents history. He claims, for example, that starting with the Peel Commission era in 1937, \\"winning control of [Jerusalem's] Jewish population and establishment of the state were more important to the Zionists than sovereignty over... East Jerusalem.\\" Not true. He also falsely implies that Menachem Begin --- one of the most passionate defenders of Judaism's holiest shrines --- was prepared to consider \\"removing the Temple Mount from... Israeli sovereignty and establishing an 'Islamic state' in the heart of the Old City...\\" Nonsense.<br /><br />Camp David's one city/twin capital solution would have established a Palestinian Jerusalem - Al Quds - alongside the Jewish city and Palestinian sovereignty over most of Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods. It would also have provided Arabs wide-reaching civil and religious authority in the Old City. Barak even agreed to appoint Arafat official custodian of the Muslim holy sites on the Temple Mount.<br /><br />But Klein ignores several key facts. In 2000, tens of thousands of Jerusalem Arabs hurriedly applied for Israeli citizenship and signed petitions to protest the proposed transfer of their neighborhoods to authoritarian rule. More important, Barak declared the Camp David \\"oral understandings\\" to be non-binding when he left office.<br /><br />Furthermore, neither Yasser Arafat nor his Palestinian Authority can be trusted. Just today, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said that President Bush would not meet Yasser Arafat because he has failed to stop incitement and violence. He has broken every agreement he ever made. In 15 months, Arabs have launched more than 7,500 attacks on Israeli civilians and noncombatants, a disincentive for Israel to repeat its offer.<br /><br />Klein misses no opportunity to heap blame on Israel. He berates every Israeli government for failing to improve the lot Jerusalem's Arabs--even while he sympathetically notes their view of Israeli investments in Jerusalem infrastructure \\"as another type of conquest.\\" He wildly exaggerates the effects of Jewish \\"extremists.\\" Yet he ignores altogether Hitlerian incitements that emanate daily from Arab media, schools and mosques; the waqf's destruction of Second Temple remains; and the free access to the holy sites that has been a cornerstone of Israeli rule.<br /><br />Klein fails to prove that surrendering any part of the ancient Jewish capital would bring peace to Israel. In fact, as Professor Friedman rightly concludes, Israel cannot cede the most important Jewish historical and religious sites without imperiling national security and opening to question Israel's very sovereignty in the land.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

So we learn in the introduction to this charming book. \\"I found myself weeping as I read of the indomitable spirit with which endless generations of Jews have faced a hostile world,\\" she writes.<br /><br />The book includes 20 stories, none more than two pages, and several of them related, touchingly, in only one. Several are Biblical, such as Abraham and the idols, how Moses became a stutterer, Jonah and Ninevah and one of David. Children will also delight in Solomon's lesson about the importance of small creatures.<br /><br />Other tales are Talmudic, for example one about the boy who prays with a flute.<br /><br />Still others are humorous, like the tale of the cobbler from Chelm: On a trip from Chelm to the big city, he falls asleep under a tree, but first points his boots toward Warsaw so he'll know which way to go when he awakens. As he sleeps, a branch dangling from the side of a wagon turns the boots around. When he wakes, the toes point towards Chelm so he follows them back home. He arrives thinking, \\"Why is Warsaw so famous? This is no different than Chelm.\\"<br /><br />Kids love these stories so much that our copy is falling apart.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

This book provides a backbone, chock full of events and places referred to elsewhere in more depth.<br />It is also an excellent resource for readers wanting only one book on the subject. It provides a superb outline of the conflict's contours and history, beginning with the Israelites, and continuing through 1948 until the recent past--and will educate even the well educated.<br />Central to that history, as the book shows, has been a pan-Arab policy of non-negotiation with the Jewish state. As the Bards note, Arabs rejected the Peel Commission's proposed partition in 1936 and the UN partition of 1947. Each would have created a second Palestinian Arab state (the first being Jordan) alongside Israel. But within 24 hours of Israel's 1948 declaration of statehood, 7 Arab states invaded, openly declaring plans for a &quot;war of annihilation&quot; to be remembered &quot;like the Crusades.&quot;<br />Israel obtained no assistance from Western powers in that war. The book shows that the Arabs did. Israel barely won, and lost 6,373 casualties in the process--nearly 1% of her population of 650,000, proportionately equal to twice US losses in World War II. On an absolute basis, Arab losses were about half as high.<br />The book also outlines how this pattern repeated over the next 50 years. The Israel-Egypt and Israel-Jordan peace accords brought some calm, for example, but those treaties did not eliminate the problem. The principal of non-negotiation remains a pillar of the Fateh constitution, which still calls for &quot;Complete liberation of Palestine, and eradication of Zionist economic, political, military and cultural existence.&quot;<br />After reading this fair, balanced and solid piece of reporting, you will have a firm grasp of why the conflict has proved so frustratingly intractable.

A few months later, Ibn Taymiya became the basis for the actions of 3 of Anwar Sadat's 4 assassins, who had read him extensively.<br />Pipes divided the book into 5 sections, each including 4 or 5 articles. He groups them somewhat loosely and the articles run the gamut.<br />Islam and Public Life first discusses fundamentalist views of America and Russia, also touching on how the secular, traditional and reform branches of Islam relate to public life. It next examines religious similarities between Judaism and Islam--both of which stress correct action, compared with Christianity's focus on faith. Pipes shows the far-reaching extent of Muslim anti-Semitism, which stemmed from a patronizing view of other religions that became virulently anti-Jewish in the 20th century--and found welcome among Western Protestants, human rights activists, reporters, academic committees and even liberals seeking a &quot;respectable forum in which to vent their own views about Jews.&quot;  Pipes also covers the Muslims of Central Asia--which border Taliban Afghanistan's fundamentalist hotbed.<br />A section on the Persian Gulf attributes the origins of the Iraq-Iran war not to religious differences, but to economic and geographic factors--including the Shatt al-'Arab River and its vast water resources. Pipes also discusses the dangers that oil wealth poses to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Libya. The oil windfall made these desert sheikdoms dependent on a continued oil boom, unless new sources of income could be found. So far, none have emerged. Pipes praised Kuwait in 1986 when its government refused to buckle under US pressure to release imprisoned terrorists, and later toured the oil state as the guest of Minister of Information, Sheik Nasir. He found the Bedouin descendants' grand hospitality and intellect reflective of the Arabian Nights. Next, he considered the Saudi Arabian kingdom formed by Wahhabi leader Abd al-Aziz, dissecting various histories, including Peter Mansfield's The New Arabians, funded by the Bechtel Corporation.<br />Pipes' prescient take on the Arab-Israeli conflict also still holds value. The conflict is fueled, he believes, not by Israel but by the conflicting claims of Palestinian separatists, Arab nationalists and the Jordanian and Syrian governments, among others, over Palestine and its boundaries. The latters' perpetual incapacity to unify stems from irreconcilable goals. An Arab government's sponsorship of the PLO grows, he wrote, proportionate to its distance from Israel. Pipes considered no Arab nation eager to end the conflict. By implication, he believed that nothing Israel could do unilaterally would improve the conflict's complexion. Were the PLO, fundamentalists or Syria to inherit the Arab claim, he predicted that the conflict would last longer--which is precisely what happened with Arafat's violent rejection of Oslo in 2000. Pan-Arabism spawned the PLO, prompting Saudi Arabia to give Arafat's organization $250 million a year by the late 1970s, and other oil states, smaller sums. But this funding dictated that PLO behavior would reflect weighted-Arab demands for Israel's destruction, more than Palestinian needs. Meanwhile, the PLO dictatorship brutalizes its own people, as evidenced during its reign of terror in Southern Lebanon from 1975 through 1982.<br />Another real gem is the section on terrorism. Pipes provides background for suicide terrorism, which is not rooted so much in Islam as in state-sponsorship. The first major instance of suicide terror was the 1981 destruction of the Iraqi embassy in Beirut, which killed 27 and wounded over 100. The phenomenon picked up political steam with the 1982 murder of Lebanon's Bashir Jumayyil and went international with the 1983 bombing of the US embassy in Beirut, which killed 63. Later the same year, a truck bomb killed 241 US servicemen, also in Lebanon. State sponsorship, he shows, was behind most suicidal actions. Many suicides were recruited via blackmail or under other duress. The way to combat it, he wrote, is to punish states that sponsor this violence.<br />And finally, for the finale, we learn pointedly what is wrong with media coverage of the Middle East. &quot;Put simply, American journalists are interested in only two topics in the Middle East: Israel and the United States. Whatever takes place that is related to these countries is amplified...;whatever does not is ignored.&quot; From 1972 to 1980, for example, ABC, CBS and NBC devoted an average of 98.4 minutes annually to Israel, only 54.7 minutes to Egypt, 42.4 minutes to the PLO, 25.7 minutes to Syria, 18.4 minutes to Lebanon, 12.7 minutes to Saudi Arabia, 8.5 to Jordan and 7.2 to Iraq. But the US and the Middle East won an average of 153 minutes of coverage annually. &quot;Israel is imagined to be more powerful than it really is because it is watched so closely,&quot; Pipes writes. Similarly, attention given to Palestinian refugees far is out of proportion to their suffering, which in any case is caused by their own leaders' refusal to accept peace. During the same era far greater numbers of Vietnamese, Cambodian, Afghan, Somali and other refugees , whose ranks now include some 2 million Sudanese, suffered far worse tribulations, which shamefully got far less press attention. Being overexposed, Pipes rightly concludes, means that Israel is &quot;held to impossible moral standards.&quot; Israel is measured &quot;not in relation to [its enemies] or other states, but in relation to abstract ideals.&quot;<br />Pipes offers 10 times the wisdom of many other volumes, despite the book's age.

A few pieces are clearly dated. But for the most part, age has not lessened their value. Overall, they provide understanding of a conflict-filled region that violently surged into view with the Islamic terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.<br />The book is divided into 4 sections. Although scholarly, the articles are easily accessible to lay readers wanting a broad overview of the troubles currently afflicting the entire region.<br />The first four articles provide a frightening window onto the political realities in Egypt, Algeria, Lebanon and the fundamentalist Sunni states. Emmanuel Sivan considers the shape an Egyptian Islamic republic might take. His sobering sketch is hardly far-fetched: Moderates and secularists like Hussein Ahmad Amin and Faraj Fuda despair that even former moderates like H. Hanafi and A. Abdel Malek now sympathize with fundamentalists. Similarly, Khalid Duran portrays the political dysfunction that overtook Algeria during its 2nd revolution in 1988, when Algerian soldiers killed nearly 500 rioting children and where militant Islam remains a force to reckon with. Hilal Khashan found Shi'i students in Lebanon to espouse surprising political moderation. However, he predicted a Pan-Arab revival north of Arabia, fueled by Sunnis who are apt to support Saddam Hussein and radical anti-Western views. This seems already to have occurred.<br />Of six articles on the Arab-Israeli conflict, the first four are most interesting. Michael Mandelbaum considers Israel's security dilemma. Mitchell Bard predicts that, near-term, the &quot;emotional, religious and historical sources of conflict&quot; will not disappear. Aaron David Miller posits that Arab &quot;cost/benefit&quot; analysis has recently moderated their policies, though he considers a return to old animosities possible so long as Arab states maintain a war stance toward Israel. And Robert Satloff warns darkly that Washington risked disaster in attempting to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict without considering the influence of fundamentalists in the West Bank and Gaza.<br />The book also includes five superb articles on the Persian Gulf. Efriam Karsh's 1989 article warned that the Iran-Iraq war badly eroded international red lines during war, including the use of poison gas, increasing the potential for violent Middle Eastern wars. This was born out with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait a year later, and judging from recent events, we have not seen the last of this. Martin Kramer exposes the clash of Muslims against Muslims in Mecca in 1987. Two articles on Iranian-US relations are somewhat more dated, but still relevant. Eliyahu Kanovsky, whom I once interviewed for Forbes, predicted that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait would precede a decline in oil prices. Kanovsky's ideas were so counter-intuitive that Forbes wouldn't print them. Nevertheless, he was right. We should listen.<br />The final section features only three articles--on the military benefits of US relations with Israel (Steven Spiegel); the April 1986 US raid on Libya (Frederick Zilian) and how the Iran-Contra story broke (Daniel Pipes). The last one is worth the entire price of admission, especially for journalists curious about the mechanical details of THE story of the 1980s. Alyssa A.

Books	5	11	14	N	N	Corrective history	This book thoroughly examines the correspondence between Britain's Lord Kitchener and Sir Henry McMahon and Sherif Hussein of Mecca. The dominant theme of those letters relates to &quot;Arab independence,&quot; a loose phrase that has caused a great deal of misunderstanding.<br />Friedman found McMahon's original Arabic October 24, 1915 letter as well as its retranslation into English by the Cairo British office from November 1919. By comparing these two letters, he makes it clear that both the Arab and British understood that Palestine was NOT to be included in the British pledge.<br />Hussein actually welcomed the return of the Jewish people to Palestine, as did his son Emir Feisal, who believed that Arab-Jewish cooperation would be a boon to Arab independence, and prevent European interference.<br />This evidence is bolstered by Friedman's presentation of a Sept. 16, 1916 note from Sir Edward Grey, the British foreign secretary, to Sir James Rodd, ambassador in Rome. It confirms an earlier correspondence in which Grey had authorized Sir Reginald Wingate in the Sudan to assure Sherif Hussein that any terms of peace would place &quot;the Arabian peninsula and its Mohammeden Holy Places in the hands of an independent Sovereign Moslem State.&quot;<br />Friedman shows other proof as well. Arnold Toynbee, who attended the January and February 1919 Peace Conference, testified that the Emir Feisal specifically excluded Palestine and Lebanon from Arab national aspirations. Friedman also shows how Toynbee later created the myth of a twice promised land, although he knew perfectly well that Palestine had never been promised to the Arabs, that it had been promised only to the Jewish people.<br />Friedman fully examines the terms of the Weizmann-Feisal Agreement of 1919. Regarding Zionist aspirations in Palestine, Feisal said: &quot;[The] Arabs admit the moral claims of the Zionists. They regard the Jews as kinsmen whose just claims they will be glad to see satisfied.&quot;<br />Feisal added, &quot;No true Arab can be suspicious of Jewish nationalism....and I do say to the Jews--welcome back home.... Dr. Weizmann's ideals are ours.&quot;<br />Friedman's second volume, forthcoming, will cover 1920 through 1939, and the creation of the historical myth. Alyssa A.

Although periodic slaughters never reached the level of the Chmielnicki pogroms in 1648 and 1649, which left more than 100,000 Jews dead, as the 20th century began, anti-Semitism in Europe remained a terrible force. The 19th and early 20th century were meanwhile an era of universal nationalism. Peoples around the globe reached into their respective pasts, bolstering identities and calling for national borders. For the Jewish people, nationalism was heightened by a threat to existence that few if other people (except the Turkish Armenians) experienced.<br /><br />Shapira shows admirably that hope and self-preservation, not belligerence, drove the first and second waves of Jewish immigrants from Europe and elsewhere in the Middle East to Palestine. From 1881 through 1914, Jewish immigrants joined the families of co-religionists who had lived in Palestine since before the destruction of the second Temple in 70 AD. Some sensed hostility among young Arabs of Jaffa. Others, like David Ben Gurion and Berl Katznelson, remarked on little about Arab inhabitants except their extreme poverty, illiteracy and the diseases by which they were afflicted. The immigrants had no complex ideology or political structure; They merely wanted to live in Zion, which the Jewish people had for 2,000 years considered their homeland. Funded by Jewish organizations and philanthropists such as Baron Rothschild, they began buying land in quantity.<br /><br />While some Jewish settlers developed a chauvinistic attitude, Shapira also shows that they had no plans to conquer resident Arabs. On the contrary, they adapted local customs and culture--wearing kaffia headdresses, riding horses and carrying weapons.<br /><br />From 1905 on, as pogroms against Jews in Russia intensified, Jewish settlers arrived understanding the need for self-defense. Yet, no discernable confrontation between Arabs and Jews took shape until the Young Turk revolution rocked the Ottoman empire in 1908, bringing Arab nationalism to Syria in particular. Even then, disputes in Palestine remained local and concerned grazing rights and water. Buying land, Jews learned, did not always entitle them to water sources on it. Where Arabs considered grazing pastures public domain, Jews who had purchased land expected it to be theirs' alone. As they had in Europe, Jewish settlers optimistically hoped for peaceful relations with non-Jewish neighbors.<br /><br />As World War I approached, however, moods crystallized. Zionist immigrants burdened their new situation with their previous outlook. As in Europe, they attributed the animosity of others to agitation and incitement, in this case, by Christian and urban Arabs. Here, as in Europe, incitement definitely existed. As the Ottoman grip on Palestine gave way to anarchy, anti-Jewish hatred increased. Jewish land purchasers were constantly beset by sellers' fraud: Claims and counterclaims, violence and counterviolence arose. Worse, legal purchases often displaced fellaheen--tenant farmers.<br /><br />Based on their European experience, when violence arose against the Jews, they assumed the authorities would not protect them. Jewish settlers who had arrived hoping for peace and security in their ancient land discovered that they had exchanged one \\"existential threat for another.\\" Jewish defensive thinking gelled after the Yom Kippur 1928 and August 1929 riots and lasted until 1936, when the Arab Rebellion--during which Jews were murdered with abandon--stimulated a Jewish offensive strategy.<br /><br />This was followed by the most traumatic 9 years in Jewish history--1939 through 1947, during which the spontaneous response in Palestine was to go to the aid of Europe's Jews. Jews came, rightly, to believe that they could rely only on themselves. This ethos was celebrated by poets like Nathan Alterman and Hannah Senesh. The Nazis murdered the latter, then 26, after she parachuted behind enemy lines to aid her fellow Jews. In Palestine, Jewish self-preservation was directed at the British, whose grotesque 1939 White Paper, Shapira shows, locked Jews out of the National Home that the League of Nations approved for them in 1922.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

Actually, this book is propaganda, not the reverse. These essays weakly attempt to recast Israel's 1947 and 1948 fight for survival --- and fail.<br /><br />There is nothing new to the idea that Israel instigated the flight of Arabs from Israel in 1947 and 1948, but the falsity of these accusations has been proved time and again by extensive historical research since 1948. Israel did not deliberately expel Arabs.<br /><br />Taken on together, or case by case, such claims are easily disproved. Inhabitants of Saffuriya, for example, accuse Israel of ethnic cleansing. But in the 1930s, the village hosted anti-Jewish radicals and in 1948 it was headquarters for Arab Liberation Army leader Fawzi al-Qawuqji, who ignored the June 11, 1948 U.N. truce. Thus inhabitants fled en masse, expecting &#34;revenge for their numerous onslaughts upon Jews,&#34; --- before the IDF captured the village, according to historical documents, military orders, oral testimonies and diaries cited in Yoav Gelber's Palestine 1948 (p. 165).<br /><br />These authors also accuse Israel by selectively citing certain items but neglecting critical contextual factors that disprove their allegations.<br /><br />Contrary to this book's contention, &#34;civil war in Palestine&#34; did not &#34;break out&#34; on Nov. 30, 1947. The &#34;outbreak&#34; wasn't spontaneous, but a well organized series of Arab riots and attacks targeting Jewish communities and people after Arab commanders, leaders and neighboring nations rejected the U. N. Partition Plan--which Israel had just accepted.<br /><br />These authors, like many other anti-Israel dogmatists, harp on 100 Arabs killed at Deir Yassin. They neglect to mention that the village was a militant stronghold, and was central to Arab attacks on the roads to Jerusalem, intended to cut off the city's access to Jews. Iraqi combatants had settled in Deir Yassin, and joined local aggressors. Arab men dressed in women's clothes and opened fire. They weren't innocent civilians. Likewise, Arabs at a Haifa refinery murdered 50 Jewish civilian co-workers on Dec. 30, 1947 and Arabs slaughtered 80 civilian Jewish medical workers and professors on Apr. 13, 1948. The sole motivation were the victims' Jewish faith.<br /><br />For his part, Rashid Khalidi focuses on 1948 Palestinian Arab failures--criticizing Jerusalem Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini. Yet he ignores Haj Amin's alliance with Hitler, his wartime refuge in Berlin, his anti-Jewish Berlin radio broadcasts, and his personal request that Hitler refuse to spare 400,000 Hungarian Jews in exchange for military supplies. Haj Amin also elicited a Nazi promise to exterminate Israel's Jews. Nor does Khalidi mention Palestinian Arab murders of all but two 131 prisoners who surrendered at Etzion Bloc.<br /><br />Avi Shlaim claims that Jewish soldiers vastly outnumbered 25,000 Arab soldiers. But as Porath notes, Israel's Jewish people totaled no more than 750,000, could find no more fighters, and exhausted their resources mounting their self-defense, while seven Arab nations opposing them could easily have drafted far more soldiers from their combined populations of more than 50 million.<br /><br />Finally, comes the late Edward Said, writing on his family's &#34;flight&#34; from Jerusalem's Talbieh neighborhood. The details confirm--like many 1948, 1949 and 1950 Arab newspaper articles, radio broadcasts, U.N. and Arab League statements and personal Arab accounts--that Arab leaders' urgent calls for Palestinian flight, resulted in massive, voluntary urban Palestinian departures. Said claims to have been forced to leave. His own details contradict him.<br /><br />Despite these essayists claims, 1947 and 1948 Arab attacks on Jews were very significant, and existentialthreats, just like frequent publicly announced plans to destroy Israel at its birth.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

This book, with more than 1,800 citations, should be required reading for every Middle East reporter.<br /><br />Peters shows that for 70 years before Israel's independence, there was considerable Arab immigration INTO Palestine--a history confirmed among others by Arieh Avneri's pre-Peters book, [[ASIN:0878559647 The Claim of Dispossession: Jewish Land Settlement and the Arabs, 1878-1948]]. This began in 1878, when Jewish settlers joined tens of thousands of Jews whose families lived in Palestine for two millennia after it was sacked by the Romans in 70 AD.<br /><br />She shows at length that while Palestine was later conquered by a long parade of others--including Muslims, Crusaders, Saracens, and finally the Ottoman Empire--none ever drove the Jews out completely.<br /><br />Peters provides documentation by many non-Jewish 19th century travelers, including Mark Twain (Innocents Abroad) and French and British envoys, of a desolate Palestine, whose small population included long-established Jewish communities in Jerusalem, Safed, Nablus, Jericho and other towns. In the 1870s, Jewish settlers from the Middle East and Europe began joining their co-religionists in Palestine. Arab immigration increased as Jewish development raised economic conditions far above those of neighboring Arab countries. Jewish farmers bought land at above-market prices from absentee effendi landlords in Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and elsewhere, employing both Arabs and Jews. Arabs also came for jobs in the government and building the railroads, roads and Haifa port.<br /><br />Peters also notes a long history of Arab aggression against Israel, and before that, Jews. In the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, she shows that Arab pogroms killed thousands of Jews and destroyed many Jewish West Bank and Gaza communities established long before the 1948 war, some for hundreds or thousands of years. This followed a pattern of abuse, Peters demonstrates, which dominated much of the Arab world for 1,000 years. There, Jews were a minority, often (though not always) oppressed--subject to periodic rapes, massacres, dispersion and other horrors.<br /><br />A former journalist and peace negotiator, Peters shows that over time reporters have revised history and accepted the false thesis that Palestinian Arabs were peace-loving victims of Jewish aggressors, while ignoring voluminous Arab propaganda proving the exact opposite. In 1948, for example, Hajj Amin el-Husseini--the British-appointed Jerusalem mufti--called for a war of annihilation against the Jews, a threat repeated by Gamel Naser in 1967....<br /><br />As Peters notes, the League of Nations' Palestine Mandate--adopted with the blessings of Sharif Hussein of Mecca and King Faisal of Iraq--included TransJordan. Britain unilaterally gave more than 75% of Palestine to Emir Abdullah. He illegally expelled 100,000 Jewish residents from that part of what international law had designated a National Home for the Jews. Jordan, she writes, is a de facto Palestinian Arab state. Moreover, she notes, at the prompting of Arab Nazi collaborators, Britain all but closed Palestine's doors to Europe's Jews in 1939--effectively greasing the wheels of Hitler's war against them.<br /><br />Finally, Peters shows that Israeli self-defense has never equaled Arab aggression or the hate that she documents so thoroughly.<br /><br />A particularly vindictive 1986 criticism of this book was unraveled in a July 1986 Commentary article by Erich and Rael Jean Isaac. It noted that the author made serious errors, and failed to correct them when the essay was later republished in a book.<br /><br />More important, even Peters' worst Israeli detractors do not contest her basic premise --- that Palestine's Arab population ballooned by virtue of Arab immigration. After all, her sources include an interview with Tewfik Bey El-Hurani, published in August 1934, which stated \\"in the last few months, from 30,000 to 36,000 Huranese [Syrians] had entered Palestine and settled there.\\"<br /><br />If anything, Peters understates her case. Supporting evidence includes the testimony of Moshe Shertok and Eliahu Epstein, given to the Palestine Royal Commission, who visited 30 Hurani villages and complained of an influx of Huranis. In 35 Western Palestine regions that became Israel, the Arab population rose 135% from 1922 and 1947, compared to a 98% increase in 13 regions of Jewish settlement. But in cities REMOVED from Jewish development--Nablus, Jenin and Hebron--Arab population grew at much slower 56%, 78% and 64% rates, respectively. Avraham Brawer in 1949 similarly compared Western Palestine's population with far less dense populations of neighboring Arab countries.<br /><br />In other words, Peters is correct: Jewish development fueled Arab migration into Palestine and, consequently, a large proportion of Arab population growth.<br /><br />Readers in doubt should also consult Arieh Avneri. So should anyone who cares about truth and justice.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

We hear from the Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev, who cries &quot;Woe is me! Rosh Hashanah, the Day of Judgement is almost here, and I have not mended myself!&quot;<br />And from a man, lost in the forest. When asked the way out by another lost soul, he replies, &quot;Do not take the way I have gone, for that will lead you stray. Now let us look for the right way together.&quot;<br />It also includes one of my favorite stories--that of a generous rabbi who before dawn awoke, disguised himself as Vasil the peasant, crept in the shadows to the edge of town, cut a tree, chopped it into wood and brought it to a run-down shack at the edge of the forest. &quot;How will I pay you?&quot; asked the widowed occupant. &quot;I will trust you,&quot; replied the rabbi, before kindling the fire and leaving without a word.<br />Children learn, also, about important New Year rituals, such as prayers for forgiveness (Selichot) at midnight on the Saturday before Rosh Hashanah, the giving of Tzedakah (charity), blessing and eating round Challah and apples dipped in honey (for a sweet and full year), tossing crumbs into moving water (Tashlich, to throw away our bad deeds), and the blowing of the Shofar, the ram's horn, to announce the beginning of the year, remind us that God is ruler and judge and warn us to improve ourselves.

It explains in simple terms why we need the new beginning offered by the High Holidays of Rosh Hashonah and Yom Kippur. It also distinguishes between the things for which God can forgive us, and the things that can only be forgiven by the wronged person.<br />The book includes four short Midrashim, which help to convey the healing message of Yom Kippur.<br />My favorite is the tale of the young boy whose father takes him to the synagogue, where he listens all day to the prayers and singing. Not knowing how to pray, he plays on his flute. His father becomes angry with him. But the Rabbi says, &quot;All Yom Kippur I have prayed so hard that our sins might be forgiven. But I felt that my prayers were not heard. When your little boy played on his flute, I knew at once the gates of heaven had opened.&quot;<br />The book includes several prayers, too, in Hebrew, transliteration and translation. These are child-sized Hadlikat Nerot (candle lighting blessings), Hamotzi (blessing on the Challah), Birkat Hamazon (blessing after the meal), Birkat Habanim (blessing of the children) and Neilah (with the Shema).

It should not.<br /><br />David Kerzter's work extends the ongoing study of how much the Catholic Church contributed to anti-Semitism in the 19th and 20th centuries--a study that must continue if Catholic-Jewish relations are ever to be fully normalized, as both the Jewish people and the current Holy Father would like.<br /><br />Kertzer takes the work of James Carroll and John Cornwell (reviled by many) a step further: Neither Carroll nor Cornwell had access to the same recently-opened secret Vatican archives as Kertzer. He can thus refute, with full confidence, the 1998 Vatican claim in a report called \\"We Remember: A Reflection on the Shoah,\\" that the Catholic Church bore no responsibility for the Nazi Holocaust.<br /><br />\\"The Vatican Commission, which came out with a report after 11 years, totally misrepresented what that history was,\\" Kertzer told Eric J. Greenberg of Jewish Week in mid-September, 2001. \\"Unfortunately, the official Church is unwilling and unable to come to terms with its own history.\\"<br /><br />In fact, Kertzer found considerable evidence of Vatican-sponsored anti-Jewish incitement. He rightly believes that there is no difference between the Church's anti-Judaism and anti-Semitism. The Church contends that it never sponsored the latter, which it defines as a racial, socioeconomic movement opposing Church doctrine.<br /><br />But Kertzer shows pages of memos, confidential letters and other documents which clearly demonstrate a continuous line of anti-Jewish policy from Popes from the 19th century forward, despite the fact that by then Jews had begun to earn freedoms so long denied them in Europe. Popes, for example, confined Jews in the Papal States to live in cramped ghettos without hospitals, denying them the right to work in most occupations--policies which remained in force into the 20th century, despite protests by Jewish leaders and even some Cardinals.<br /><br />Mussolini's anti-Jewish racial laws in 1938 elicited no response from the Pope. These laws banned Jewish teachers and children from public schools and Jewish adults from civil service jobs, among other things.<br /><br />The Vatican has also censored all anti-Semitic comments of Pope Pius XI contained in the official public record of his letters. Therefore, Kertzer legitimately asks about the veracity of other material released by the Holy See.<br /><br />This casts doubt upon the current discussion of the Vatican's proposed beatification of Pope Pius XII. According to Kertzer, it should focus not only on what Pius XII failed to do to save Europe's Jews from 1933 through 1945. It should also center on the role of the Church in the decades-long demonization of the Jewish people.<br /><br />Only after full disclosure of the Church's sins can an honest discussion between the Jewish people and the Catholic Church begin to repair the tattered bonds of these two major faiths. That is exactly why this book is critical.<br /><br />Judaism teaches that, to be forgiven for sins against others, a person must ask forgiveness from those wronged. Clearly, the Church cannot seek forgiveness from millions murdered as a result of anti-Semitism it helped to spawn.<br /><br />But Judaism also teaches the importance of Tikkun Olam---healing the world. This book can help humankind in that critical work---provided that the Church and Catholics respond openly, rather than defensively, to the institutional sins exposed by this dedicated historian.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

Rosh Hashonah and Passover, aside from more important things, then also meant eating Mama's gefilte fish, which she made from fresh carp. By the day before the holiday, the market had no more big fish, so Mama always bought her carp a week in advance, and stored it, fresh, in the bathtub.<br />This particular year, though, Harry and Leah fell in love with the carp. &quot;Some carp are much more lovable than others, and that Passover, we had an unusually playful and intelligent carp in our bathtub,&quot; says Leah. To save the carp, they brought the fish downstairs to Mrs. Ginzburg, who agreed to put the carp in her bathtub instead.<br />They hoped their father would save &quot;Joe,&quot; but Papa would have none of it. He went straight to Mrs. Ginzburg's apartment, and retrieved their beloved fish before their mother even knew he was missing.<br />The children in the story never ate gefilte fish again, but a few weeks after their favorite carp died, their father brought home a cat, which they also named Joe.<br />Aside from teaching kids about bygone traditions, this story explains that they cannot always have what they want. No surprise, they love it as much as most kids love gefilte fish. Alyssa A. Lappen	2001-09-24

To ensure that he will again eat latkes that taste like clouds, he hides behind a tree outside Malke's kitchen until she starts cooking. He writes down everything she does.<br />Berel gives the paper to his wife. The recipe calls for 5 potatoes and 2 eggs. His wife Yentel says, &quot;Some secret recipe.&quot;<br />&quot;Scallions,&quot; he says. &quot;Scallions,&quot; she screams. &quot;Who ever heard of using scallions instead of onions!&quot; She uses an onion, as always. Next Malke used flour, but Yentel uses bread crumbs like always. Malke used pepper, but Yentel objects to that too, and uses salt, as always. When the recipe calls for lemon and parsley, Yentel balks again, just as she does when the recipe calls for frying in vegetable oil.<br />&quot;That's not a secret recipe, that's secret nonsense!&quot; Malke protests. So, she fries in chicken fat, as always.<br />Needless to say, the latkes come out as heavy as ever. &quot;They taste just like ours,&quot; Berel concludes.

It relates specifically to Zein Isa's November 1989 murder of his daughter, Palestina. The West Bank immigrant and his Brazilian wife co-conspired in the brutal St. Louis murder of their teenage daughter, whose friendships they believed had endangered their terrorist plans.<br />In their search for terrorists, the Federal Bureau of Investigation inadvertently taped the actual killing. Zein Isa and his wife were sentenced to death.<br />The book reveals much about the village life in the West Bank, where most families, according to Maria Zein, belong to radical military groups whose ultimate goal is to destroy Israel. Many West Bank residents are actually &quot;refugees from other countries.&quot; According Maria Zein's account, her husband knew &quot;men from Syria, Libya, Kuwait, Saudi.&quot; Maria Zein told the author that her husband had traveled from the West Bank village of Beitin, to Jordan, Syria, Libya and Bolivia. He lived undetected for years in the US, and also claimed to have lived in Europe.<br />The book reveals twisted morals, which condone murder for the sake of family honor. It unmasks intense hatred that evolved into conspiracies to slaughter Jews, blow up the Israeli embassy in Washington and to murder Tina because she posed a threat to these plans.<br />It also exposes the frighteningly broad inroads that the Abu Nidal terrorists have made into American cities and life.

She knows the holiday is serious but not what that means.<br /><br />She fights with her sister, who will not return her doll, and her brother who tells her Yom Kippur will require that she sit still and think about the things she's done wrong during the year. She calls him a liar and runs to her Mom, who reassures her that the kind of birthday she will have is a surprise.<br /><br />On the day itself, she runs for breakfast, but gets no presents. Mom and Dad are fasting, and go to Temple with Arnold. She waits for a long time, bored.<br /><br />When they come back, they take her to Temple in the afternoon. Here she sees the Stars of David, the sparkling eternal light over the ark holding Torah scrolls, and the rabbi and cantor (who is a woman).<br /><br />The rabbi tells the story of Jonah, which is one of two Torah portions for Yom Kippur. Minnie doesn't like the story--until the rabbi explains, \\"Most people don't do bad things like Jonah did to God, but little things to other people.\\"<br /><br />When you remember those little things that hurt others, he says, you must apologize as soon as possible. Minnie remembers her fights with her sister and brother, whispers apologies to them--and feels better. As services end, Minnie thrills at the sound of the shofar, the long blast.<br /><br />Then, the rabbi recites a Kiddush. The congregants come out with a big birthday cake, that says \\"Happy Birthday Minnie.\\" Minnie hugs her dad.<br /><br />The important message--to treat others well and always to make amends--comes through loud and clear.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

An older couple live a lively and productive farm life, but long for children they cannot have.<br />Then the magic begins. One March night, rain pattering on their roof arouses the woman. &quot;Wake up, old man, I've heard the moonshower brings good fortune to everyone it touches!&quot; They go out and stand in the rain. There, in the grass and wildflowers are shining drops of water, each holding a baby.<br />The couple care diligently for their found little poems. They carry their babies in a willow basket while they do their chores, saving them from several near-disasters--a sudden storm, a weasel, and lightening-set fire. The babies sleep in a dresser drawer, covered gently by a scarf.<br />One night a man arrives, placing on their table a basket of silvery twigs filled with tiny pearls. He offers them an enormous jewel for their babies. &quot;Thank you,&quot; says the woman, &quot;but the babies will stay with us.&quot; The man transforms into Mother Moonshower, who must take her babies home. &quot;You musn't,&quot; cries the woman. The woman kisses her sleeping rainbabies goodbye and they disappear.<br />But not before Mother Moonshower gives them, in the rainbabies' place, an infant girl. Rayna grows stronger and more lovely each year, and the couple feel their happiness complete.<br />Few if any children were ever adopted this way.

It shows that even before there were slaves in America, there was discrimination.<br /><br />The account of New York's early Jews begins with the suffering of the Marranos in Spain, the Spanish Inquisition and the Sephardim's flight to Brazil, where they lived for 150 years.<br /><br />But when the Portugese captured Brazil from Holland, the Dutch and the Jews who had prospered under their rule were forced to leave.<br /><br />Thus it was that Jacob Barimson arrived in New Amsterdam. Governor Peter Stuyvesant did not want Jews in his colony, but when the Sainte Catherine sailed into the harbor from the West Indies, the passengers included 23 Jews from Recife, Brazil. They had been shipwrecked and saved by the French vessel.<br /><br />Back then, New York was God-forsaken, with only 750 inhabitants. With nothing to pay their passage, the Jews were jailed for penury. Stuyvesant wrote to his corporate headquarters--the Dutch West India Co.--requesting permission to expel the Jews, who were unwelcome (like Quakers, Baptists, Lutherans and Presbyterians).<br /><br />The Jews petitioned the company to stay, and stay they did. Still, there was no equality. Jews couldn't travel to Fort Orange on the Hudson or down the Delaware River to trade. Their cemetery had to be outside the city walls, they could not own homes or shops, build a synagogue, join the army, or guard the city, though they were taxed for it anyway. In 1655, six Jewish families brought a Torah to New Amsterdam from Holland.<br /><br />When the British took over, in 1664, they were allowed to form a congregation, Shearith Israel, and in 1730 they built the first Temple in New York.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

He again posits a conspiracy theory--repeatedly disproved--by Michael Oren (spring 2000, Azure, July 2, 2001, New Republic, and the best-selling Six Days of War), and by Florida Judge A. Jay Cristol in The Liberty Incident.<br /><br />Bamford claims that Israel intentionally attacked the U.S. spy ship in order to cover up an alleged &#34;massacre&#34; of 150 Egyptian prisoners (and another 850 civilians) at El Arish. He bases this allegation on a news clip and anonymous (therefore, unverifiable) testimonials.<br /><br />In the clip, he writes, Gabi Bron was quoted as saying &#34;The Egyptian prisoners of war were ordered to dig pits and then army police shot them to death.&#34; Yet Bamford offers no evidence to support his claim that the Liberty intercepted messages concerning alleged mass murders. &#34;[T]he Israelis had massacred civilians and prisoners in the desert,&#34; he writes, &#34;and now they were prepared to ensure that no American survived the sinking of the Liberty.&#34;<br /><br />Furthermore, the news clip refers not to a massacre, but to an isolated execution of 5 Palestinian guerrillas, posing as Egyptian soldiers, who murdered several Israelis.  In a subsequent interview with Michael Oren, Bron stated that Bamford had never contacted him. Bron said: &#34;The one hundred and fifty [Egyptian] POWs were not shot, and there were no mass murders.&#34; On the contrary, Bron said, &#34;[We] helped prisoners, gave them water, and in most cases just sent them in the direction of the [Suez] Canal.&#34;<br /><br />In more than 20 years that Egypt has ruled Sinai--no known Israeli, American, Egyptian or U.N. records have documented any Israeli mistreatment (much less murder) of more than 10,000 Egyptians captured in the Six Day War--much less any mass graves.<br /><br />Bamford also paraphrases former Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) historian Aryeh Yitzhaki, writing, &#34; Defense Minister Moshe Dayan and Chief of Staff [Yitzhak] Rabin and the generals knew about these things.&#34; But Yitzhaki contradicts Bamford, who apparently didn't contact him, either. &#34;In no case did Israel initiate massacres,&#34; Yitzhaki wrote to Oren. &#34;[It] did everything it could to prevent them.&#34;<br /><br />True enough, hundreds of Palestinian commandos were killed around El Arish--after their June 9 ambush of IDF supply columns. But why on earth would a June 8 attack have been mounted to cover up a battle that transpired more than 24 hours later?<br /><br />Another error: Ariel Sharon did not command Israeli troops near El Arish, as Bamford claims, but divisions which were more than 40 miles away.<br /><br />Finally, about testimony from Marvin E. Nowicki, a now-retired Southern Illinois University political scientist, who in 1967 was a NSA chief petty officer and translator aboard the USS Liberty. Nowicki heard Israeli transmissions, allegedly about an &#34;American flag,&#34;  that he later deduced came from a torpedo boat.<br /><br />Nowicki's wrote to Bamford, &#34;Our intercepts showed the attack to be an accident on the part of the Israelis.&#34; Norwicki said the torpedo boats reported sighting the flag after the action began and stopped firing immediately. In a letter to the Wall Street Journal, Nowicki emphasized that &#34;the aircraft and MTBs [Motor Torpedo Boats] prosecuted the Liberty until their operators had an opportunity to get close-in and see the flag, hence the references to the flag.&#34;<br /><br />An IDF transcript, quoted on a 1987 Thames Television special, also prove that Israeli pilots went to great lengths to identify the ship and took great risks to rescue its survivors, whom they assumed were Egyptian.  So do other NSA transcripts, released in July 2003.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Bamford in this book inserted Nowicki's recollections before describing the torpedo attack, thereby suggesting that the Israelis fired after seeing the American flag.<br /><br />Bamford also claims here that President Johnson squelched an investigation of the incident. But there was an investigation--in fact there were several investigations, all of which proved the incident an accident of war.<br /><br />Tragically--orders that the USS Liberty not sail within 100 miles of the war zone--were sent via the far east, and arrived the day after multiple &#34;fog of war&#34; errors had killed 34 U.S. servicemen and wounded 171.<br /><br />Bamford's conspiracy theory is bunk.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

He opens with the longest, on charity, or Tzedakah--the requirement for which Jewish tradition is most uncompromising.<br /><br />The glove maker's wife Rivka prepared for Rosh Hashonah, placing two loaves of round challah into her oven next to a pot of scraps of meat and some potato--hardly enough to be called stew. But she was grateful, as times were hard and others had even less.<br /><br />After a knock at the door, she expected a beggar, to whom she was embarrassed to have little to give. Instead, an elegant officer appeared. He asked her to care for his samovar--a family heirloom--during his seven-year posting to a distant land. She unwrapped the samovar to find it black with tarnish and covered in cobwebs, and polished it, with no effect.<br /><br />Another beggar knocked and she gave him a coin. The samovar brightened. She puzzled and polished it again. A poor old woman, barely able to pay her rent, passed in the street. Rivka ran to give her the larger of her two challahs.<br /><br />She returned to find the samovar again strangely brighter still.<br /><br />Rivka's husband then then rushed in, excited that a nobleman had bought a pair of leather gloves for which a widow had refused to pay. When Haskel asked for five crowns, the nobleman offered 100 and gave the glove maker 900 crowns more to make nine more pairs.<br /><br />The couple, confused, turned to their rabbi, who advised them that they had been visited by the Prophet Elijah himself. At the end of seven years, they would have to give the samovar back, and everything would be as it was before. \\"You have been given seven years of good luck. Use them well.\\"<br /><br />Rivka rushed back to the market, buying a fish for the widow, and bread, meat and vegetables for the other poor people. The samovar was now nearly clean. After the holidays, all the money was gone but Haskel sold gloves as fast as he could make them. Of this wealth, they used only what they needed and gave the rest to others. After seven years, the officer returned to find the samovar shining perfectly.<br /><br />\\"This samovar is older than the world,\\" he explained, his eyes beaming with kindness and wisdom. \\"In all the years of its existence, no one has taken better care of it than you. I believe you have earned the right to keep it.\\"<br /><br />Rivka and Haskel refused, but as they turned to take the samovar down for the officer, he disappeared. They lived for many years, and the samovar remained on their shelf, gleaming brighter than 1,000 suns.<br /><br />Kimmel's stories of prayer and repentance gleam as well.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

They openly opposed Zionism after Lord Moyne's murder in November 1944. Israel's potential rebirth threatened these semi-assimilated Anglicized Jews, who realized that reports of the extermination of European Jewry did nothing to lessen British anti-Semitism during the war.<br /><br />They feared an Israel reborn would limit their hopes to become Jewish Britons rather than British Jews and expected accusations of dual loyalty to follow any support for Zionism. They also  refused to equate Zionism with Judaism (as had Max Nordeau at the Second Zionist Congress in 1898.)<br /><br />The Fellowship in no way cooperated with other anti-Zionist bodies such as the Arab Office, whose goal was to promote Arab causes in Britain, or the Committee for Arab Affairs (CAA), neither of which cared a fig about Jewish identity. But the latters' efforts to kill the Jewish state before it was born were equally intense.<br /><br />The CAA, established in 1945 by Sir Edward Spears (another former Conservative MP) quickly became the vehicle of non-Jewish Arabists and anti-Zionists. Financed via London's Arab Legations, often via the Arab Club's account, the group at its peak successfully lobbied as many as 40 Members of Parliament. Sir Ronald Storrs, the former military governor of Jerusalem following the Balfour Declaration, was a prominent CAA leader. This perceived Middle East expert was badly informed and prejudiced, according to David Fromkin's Peace to End All Peace. According to Miller he was also terribly anti-Zionist. In articles in the Sunday Times, Storrs claimed that the Histadrut had promoted strikes in order to force independent companies out of business so they could be taken over. The charge prompted legal action, and Storrs and the Sunday Times were forced to issue a joint apology, a series of events that mightily miffed Storrs.<br /><br />Then CAA chief Spears, \\"the defining personality in the anti-Zionist camp,\\" according to Miller, actively took up his cause on returning to London from a ministerial position in the Levant at the end of 1944. The Jewish Chronicle regarded him as \\"the Pickwickian fatboy\\" enslaved to the Arab cause. Spears may have been the first to outlandishly compare Zionism to Nazism. He claimed (equally outlandishly) that the Yishuv supported the Allies during the war for profit. After Israel's establishment, many British anti-Zionists gave up, but Spears continued trying to delegitimize the Jewish state until he died in the 1970s.<br /><br />Miller provides an excellent window onto the campaign of British anti-Zionists, an important area few others have considered.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

1864983:US	52709697	R9OTR6BT69Y55	0140094725	853268502	The Penguin Book of Modern Yiddish Verse	Books	5	16	16	N	N	Trembling lips	The last time my friend from Vilna visited, in 1993, I shared this book with her, purchased a few years earlier at a New York remainder sale. It contains both the Yiddish and English translations, on either side of a page, of 39 Jewish poets. Her lips began to tremble and move as she read the verses, in Yiddish, of poets she had known in Vilna, Abraham Sutzkever and very likely Moyshe Kulbak.<br /><br />It's no wonder. Listen to the fifth stanza of Sutzkever's &#34;In the Hamlet,&#34; about Siberia, where his father died in the 1930s.<br /><br />&#34;Into the quenched corners of the room,/<br />The moon breathes its solitary brilliance./<br />My father's face is white as the moon,/<br />The snow's silence weighs upon his hands.&#34;<br /><br />(Translation by Chana Bloch)<br /><br />The poems are all that good, and better. It is eerie reading these great works. The rich literary heritage of Yiddish was all but wiped out in the Shoah. Yiddish remains vibrant in certain Jewish communities today, but only for conversation and scholarly work, not generally for literary works. Few poets now work in Yiddish.<br /><br />The great Yitskhok Leybush Perets, born in Zamosc, Poland in 1852 died in Warsaw in 1915. Leyb Naydus died in Grodno in 1918 and Moyshe-Leyb Halpern, from Zloczow, died in 1932 in New York. But several of these poets themselves perished in the Holocaust --- including Kulbak (1940), Yisroel Shtern (Warsaw, 1942), Yisroel Rabon (Ponary, 1941). Others were swept into the maw of the Soviet war on culture, dying who knows where.<br /><br />Some survived and later emigrated. Rokhl Korn, for example, fled to --- and then from --- the Soviet Union. In a sense, Aaron Teitlin, who emigrated from Uuarovo, Russia to New York in 1939 writes for them all. Certainly, he writes for me.<br /><br />Six Lines<br /><br />&#34;I know that in this world no one needs me,/<br /><br />me, a word-beggar in the Jewish graveyard.<br /><br />Who needs a poem, especially in Yiddish?<br /><br />Only what is hopeless on this earth has beauty/<br /><br />and only the ephemeral is godly<br /><br />and humility is the only true rebellion.&#34;<br /><br />  (Translated by Robert Friend)<br /><br />####<br /><br />We all need these poems and their humility.

You know, that place all the world's fools dropped when an angel flying over it accidentally tore the sack in which he was transporting them? From that day to this, we have heard of their foolishness, um, excuse me, their wisdom.<br /><br />It's hard to say which of the 14 stories is the funniest. I like \\"The enchanted goat\\" (don't worry, he isn't really) and \\"Because of a blintz\\" in which Yossel and his silly wife Sossie run into some trouble over little rolled pancakes filled with sour cream.<br /><br />But my favorite (and I think my children agree) is \\"The holes in the bagels.\\" Mayor Gimpel, his grandson Abba and another Helm worthy travel from Helm to Vilna, the capital of Lithuania. After a night in a fine hotel, the three men assemble to discuss the fools in this city. (Now remember, this is in the Jerusalem of Lithuania, famed for its scholars and rabbis.)<br /><br />\\"One is more stupid than the other,\\" says Abba. \\"Worst of all, they have no sense of humor. As I wandered through the city, all I found was noise, hurry and bustle. There is not a shred of reason or logic in their behavior.\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, the wise men of Helm prove themselves foolish several times over. But the funniest idiocy in this tale follows their first encounter with bagels.<br /><br />\\"Look at them,\\" said Shloime. \\"Did you ever see baked goods like this? It is shaped like a millstone, with a hole in the middle and a ring of dough around the hole. But never mind the shape. Taste it!\\"<br /><br />The next day, all three Helmites went back to the bakery and ate a dozen bagels each. When they could eat no more, they asked the baker to teach them how to make them. Rueben turned to Shloime and asked, \\"I'd like the baker to go over it again from the beginning. Especially, I'd like to know how he gets the hole in the middle.\\"<br /><br />Well those holes cause more fun before the tale is done.

The Lord told King Solomon the dimensions for the Temple he must build and what materials to use. But King Solomon may not use iron, \\"for iron is a metal of war.\\" As to how, without iron, builders can hew timbers for the ceiling and split stones for the walls, the Lord remains silent.<br /><br />Then Nathan the prophet told King Solomon of the wondrous creature called the Shamir, fashioned by God from beams of light --- although no bigger than a barleycorn, with the power to split massive stones.<br /><br />Solomon called for an army captain to confront Ashmodai, king of the demons, who has the Shamir. Benayahu ben Yehoyada volunteered, and took with a spade, a fleece, a jar of Greek wine, an iron chain with a holy charm carved on each link, King Solomon's magic signet ring--and the wise King's plan.<br /><br />He came to a mountain, at whose foot the winged demon king Ashmodai landed. Benayahu dug a hole beneath the cistern where the great demon king drank, letting all the water run out. The ring gave him strength to move the cistern's stone cover. Then he hid.<br /><br />Ashmodai returned and drank from the well. It was wine, which soon made him dance, and then sleep. Benayahu bound the sleeping demon king, who insisted on telling the secret location of the Shamir only to Solomon himself. In court, the demon confessed that the Lord had taken the Shamir away.<br /><br />Solomon called the birds and asked if any of them had seen the Shamir. An albatross had seen it---on a rock in the middle of the ocean. Benayahu straddles the great bird, and flies off to retrieve the Shamir, returning with the Shamir to Jerusalem. \\"And so Solomon built the Temple, without iron tools of any kind.\\" The Shamir was then returned to its rock in the northern sea--until the Messiah comes, and a new Temple rises in Jerusalem.<br /><br />Each of the seven other tales is as brave and wise as this one.<br />---Alyssa A.

This book is the first I have read about that country. It makes no apologies for Serbian atrocities. It does, however, lyrically call journalists and journalism to task.<br /><br />Written in German in late 1995 for a European audience, this 82-page book applies equally to the U.S.  I speak as a journalist who, during 25 years of largely national U.S. writing, plumbed every side to every question before reaching conclusions--always over-reporting to find nuances, and often reaching conclusions only as I wrote. It was a handicap not easily overcome.<br /><br />That is not how many, perhaps even most, journalists work. The fault is built into the system. Editors expect reporters to have an angle before they present an idea. Without a hook, assignments are often not made. Editors will deny it, but they expect reporters to have reached some conclusion before they begin reporting, and to report to prove their points. In other words, they routinely ask journalists to put the cart before the horse --- an especially troubling phenomenon in this era of political correctness.<br /><br />Reporters say they are after truth and good. Most are in fact after the big game, the story to make them famous, a kill. Nowadays CNN hires television actors as news anchors. You get the picture.<br /><br />Ironically, on big stories covered by throngs --- which I intensely disliked and avoided, and which of course include wars --- reporters tend to mimic each other, to sit around after they file, bragging about their prowess. The largest braggarts are also often the least talented.<br /><br />Institutionalized problems have a depressing effect on journalism. Few stories are black and white. But most present that illusion, although they are products of very little, if any, deductive thought.<br /><br />Certainly, nuances do not surface in short sound bites feeding most news wires. Peter Handke seems to know all this --- and a great deal of philosophy.<br /><br />Serbia aside, this book shows, in near-poetic language, that things are not always as journalists portray them. For that alone, Handke's tiny volume is worth its weight in gold.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

If you have to read this book to keep your sanity, I understand the impulse, having done it myself. But take some history lessons too. Why, you may ask, when this is a personal journey. Well, without historical or political understanding, serious shortcomings both, Wendy Orange offers only her prayers for peace. Her approach seems sadly fruitless now that Oslo is dead.<br />Israel has worked, hoped and prayed for peace since her founding, many times forced to fight for her survival. I recommend the stories of those prayers and fights over the illusory peace she presents here. You can find them in O Jerusalem, Jerusalem in the Twentieth Century, Howard Sachar's History of Israel and Chaim Herzog's The Arab-Israeli Wars.<br />They won't tell how to achieve a lasting peace, but they help explain how we got to this painful place and why it may be naive to think that any simple plan will work.

Samuel wrote the work in anger --- within two decades after the forged [[ASIN:0853035954 Protocols of Zion]] began spreading its poisonous lies &quot;that wouldn't die.&quot; While written in anger, the book predicted wholesale slaughter of Jewish people --- and unfortunately proved prophetic within an equally short period.<br /><br />Strangely, while this volume contains not a single anti-Semitic word, it has become a cult classic amongst people themselves guilty of the world's oldest hatred. Those same individuals, unfortunately, also often misconstrue Samuel's descriptions of false accusations against the Jewish people as if Samuel were saying these things himself --- as if these foul lies were actually true.<br /><br />In a chapter entitled &quot;The Reckoning,&quot; Samuel writes, that ever since the Jewish people have lived amongst gentiles, they have &quot;instinctively appealed to brute force in combating our influence.&quot; Whenever they are called to their maker, Samuel writes, gentile &quot;guilt cries to heaven: whatever have been your relations to one another, we Jews have at least been the common denominator of your brutality.&quot; To one another, he suggests, gentiles remain gentlemen, and warriors, living in democracies. But when they live alongside Jewish people, they become &quot;bullies and cowards and mobs,&quot; whose &quot;quiescent majorities wash their hands&quot; --- assigning them &quot;effective guilt.&quot; Samuel writes that it matters not that only the gentile &quot;minorities struck the blow.&quot; He would not acquit the majority, since they did nothing and do nothing to stop the hatred amongst the minority. Therefore Samuel considers them as guilty as the minority.<br /><br />In a chapter entitled The Reckoning, Samuel writes that ever since the Jewish people have lived in among gentiles, the latter &quot;instinctively appealed to brute force in combating our influence.&quot; Gentile &quot;guilt cries to heaven,&quot; Samuel observes. For however well non-Jews behave among themselves --- as gentlemen, warriors or democrats --- the Jewish people have always been &quot;the common denominator&quot; of gentile &quot;brutality.&quot;  But once living alongside Jewish people, they become &quot;bullies and cowards and mobs,&quot; whose &quot;quiescent majorities wash their hands&quot; --- and thus assume &quot;effective guilt.&quot; It doesn't matter that only gentile &quot;minorities struck the blow.&quot; Samuel considers the majority equally guilty, since they did and do nothing nothing to stop the minority's irascible hatred of Jews.<br /><br />Even non-Jewish observers, Samuel writes, have concluded that gentiles &quot;have been guilty.&quot; The Jewish people have never misrepresented non-Jews --- nor lied about them. Indeed, regardless of the poor overall education level amongst 1920s Jews --- and abuses they'd suffered at gentile hands for nearly two millennia --- Jewish people did not, do not and could not be persuaded that gentiles practiced &quot;such foul untruths&quot; as millions of gentiles &quot;believe of us.&quot;<br /><br />These lies have included false allegations of &quot;murdering children&quot; to &quot;use their blood for ritual purposes,&quot; of false accusations of &quot;poisoning wells,&quot; false accusations of &quot;precipitating wars,&quot; and --- the most monstrous (falsely attributed to Samuel by some, even here at Amazon) of &quot;to-day of fomenting a world-wide conspiracy to seize the government of the world.&quot;<br /><br />Samuel held the gentile world community &quot;responsible for all the cruelties&quot; targeting Jewish people as a result of the lies their majority had tolerated. While only a tiny American minority in the Ku Klux Klan &quot;preaches ... virtual disenfranchisement of the Jew&quot;a German minority &quot;preaches death to the Jew, and a Polish minority &quot;slew hundreds of us,&quot; Samuel asked the entire world community to apologize and compensate for the &quot;complacent majority which tolerates or accepts&quot; such barbaric lies that the &quot;masses respond with physical force.&quot; He felt justified herein, just as the allies had asked all of Germany for recompense following World War I.<br /><br />Notwithstanding Samuel's anger over blood libels and gross conspiracy theories  against the Jewish people, he presciently predicted that &quot;soon enough these crimson sluices will be opened again.&quot; The Jewish people would again &quot;bleed from a thousand wounds as we have bled before,&quot; in Ukraine, Poland, Russia, Germany and possibly even France, England and America. For the only &quot;guarantee&quot; of Jewish safety was &quot;the guarantee of public opinion&quot; --- which inauspiciously had also tolerated &quot;the slaughter of hundreds of Negroes.&quot; Therefore, Samuel was certain public opinion would also &quot;condone the slaughter of Jews.&quot;<br /><br />And so it did, within two decades. Although written within five years of World War I, Samuel's little book proved horrifically prophetic.<br /><br />Some readers obviously object to Samuel's raw tone.<br /><br />But think about this book in context: During the 1920s global hatred of the Jewish people was rising precipitously thanks to Lenin ([[ASIN:0879759305 and his heirs]]), [[ASIN:0192802917 Hitler]] and such ill-intentioned Americans as industrialist [[ASIN:1586481630 Henry Ford]].<br /><br />Consider, too: Samuel's observations concerning the indefensible nature of the ancient [[ASIN:1400060974 hatred]] (against the Jewish people) alas remain equally valid in the 21st century --- when the [[ASIN:1591025540 Islamic world]] remains firmly convinced of the ancient Jewish blood libel, revere &quot;its companion viper&quot; (the purported &quot;Protocols&quot;), and effectively demands Israel's demise --- as in the 1920s.<br /><br />Samuel's definition of old lies, rehashed, still applies: &quot;Where the old ostensible reasons for disliking the Jew collapsed, new ones, more self-conscious, were substituted.&quot; He expounds on such rationalizations in a 1940 book called [[ASIN:B000L5NEA2 The Great Hatred]].<br /><br />Even the tolerant among us can learn from this classic treatise against intolerance.

(Lewis does deserve criticism, but not for the absurd reasons Said gives: If anything, Lewis goes far too easy on the long historical records of both [[ASIN:1591026024 jihad]] and  [[ASIN:1591025540 Islamic Antisemitism]].)<br /><br />Said argues --- incorrectly, and without academic credentials in Middle Eastern studies --- that Western Middle Eastern scholars represent \\"an unbroken tradition in European thought of profound hostility, even hatred, toward Islam.\\" But according to Daniel Pipes, Said's term stuck. \\"Neo-orientalist\\" is now the worst possible insult one can hurl at any Middle Eastern scholar.<br /><br />As Martin Kramer and Jacob Lassner show in [[ASIN:9652240400 The Jewish Discovery of Islam]], however, it was a German-Jewish school that raised the study of Islam to an art and introduced it to the West. Far from promoting enmity for Islam, Western scholars --- including Benjamin Disraeli (1804-81), [[ASIN:0691100993 Ignaz Goldziher]] (1850-1921), and Muhammad Asad, n&eacute; [[ASIN:9693518527 Leopold Weiss]] of Lvov and Vienna (1900-92) --- created considerable tolerance for it. Hate? Asad even converted, advised the Saudi king, served as Pakistan's United Nations ambassador and translated the Qur'an into English.<br /><br />The German-Jewish school's empathy for Islam prevails even today. But Said writes only of what Pipes calls the defunct \\"Christian\\" approach, which saw in Islam a rival and inferior --- and which scholars long ago repudiated.<br /><br />Worse, Said fails to criticize historical or current Arab or Muslim tyranny that wiped out entire cultures, languages and faiths within the Christian nations of North Africa, from Syria to Egypt, all but eliminated Turkish Armenians in 1917, and even now plagues Egypt's Coptic Christians, Algeria and Morocco's Berbers, Lebanese Christians and Iraqi Kurds, women and Hindus in Taliban Afghanistan, Christians in Indonesia--much less Southern Sudan's Black Christians, the ongoing targets of an Arab government program of enslavement and genocide. Said decries the \\"evil\\" West, while remaining strangely silent about Arab and Muslim atrocities. These intentional omissions --- and Said's complete dishonesty regarding the numerous other gifts the West gave the world --- are covered in detail in Ibn Warraq's recent Defending the West: A [[ASIN:1591024846 Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism]].

What the world learned from the Holocaust is that you can kill six million Jews and no one will care.\\"<br /><br />This comment like many others in this superb book reverberates to the bone.<br /><br />Hass answers a need not only of the dwindling community of survivors, but of those who, while neither survivors nor children of survivors, are nevertheless heirs to horrific pain--those Jewish children born in the shadow of the Holocaust and dressed by its memories, engulfed by a pervasive sense of loss and the need to reaffirm Jewish life.<br /><br />\\"Survivors are people, not a phenomenon,\\" Hass writes. Their feelings endure. Given my own feelings, I suspect that these are echoed by the feelings of the Jewish people, which is only now, after a generation, beginning to comprehend the enormity of what occurred.<br /><br />\\"To refer to the Holocaust as 'monstrous, inhuman event' is to miss the point,\\" Hass concludes. \\"The Holocaust was imposed by men and women on other human beings. It was a time when there were people, not only the Germans, but the others too, what wanted to kill all the Jewish people.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, such sentiments are still published broadly in parts of the world, without note, much less consequence. The press considers them just as unimportant now as it did in the 1930s.<br /><br />Hass writes, \\"And so most Holocaust survivors believe that it could happen again.\\" I sadly confess, so do I.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

This book required interviews with the 732 survivors it profiles (\\"Boys\\" includes both men and women) and those who knew them after the war. Some were as young as eight or nine when the war started. Many themes Gilbert covers are like those one can read in other personal Holocaust histories. But the experiences in each case are unique.<br /><br />Martin provides two statistics I find particularly haunting. While 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust--including victims of pre-war pogroms, ghettos, concentration and death camps and death marches--only 100,000 survived the camps. And while Britain agreed to take in 1,000 Jewish \\"children\\" under the age of 16 after the war, only 732 could be found alive.<br /><br />But for me, the most fascinating part of the book is the repeated confirmation that those who returned to their homes after the war found the same kind of murderous hatred among their former neighbors as Jan Tomasz Gross describes in Neighbors.<br /><br />In other words, Jedwabne was not unique. Gross has himself said as much and plans to write more on the subject. But Gilbert also confirms that murders of Jews by locals happened during the war all over Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, and to a lesser extent, in Hungary. It also happened after the war all over Europe --- especially in the East. Returning Jews found neighbors who wished them dead, and in thousands of cases killed them. The \\"boys\\", obviously, survived. But many lost brothers, parents, friends, after the war, in Poland, Hungary, and elsewhere. Sir Martin Gilbert gives us the living proof.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

Heschel uses the great Yiddish writer Mendele Moher Sefarim's description of a typical Eastern European Jewish town--\\"where Torah was studied from time immemorial; where practically all the inhabitants are scholars, where the Synagogue or the House of Study is full of people of all classes busily engaged in studies, townfolk as well as young men from afar...where at dusk, between twilight and evening prayers, artisans and other simple folk gather around the tables to listen to a discourse on the great books of Torah, to interpretations of Scripture, to readings from theological, homiletical or ethical writings...., where on the Sabbath and the holidays, near the Holy Ark, at the reading stand, sermons are spoken that kindle the hearts of the Jewish people for the Divine Presence, sermons seasoned with parables and aphorisms of the sages, in a voice and a tone that heartens one's soul, that melts all limbs, that penetrates the whole being.\\" Study included all: Indeed, a book preserved at New York's Yivo Institute bears the stamp of the Berditshev Society of Wood Choppers for the Study of Mishnah, the earliest part of Talmud.<br /><br />A Christian scholar who visited Warsaw during World War I saw many parked coaches with no drivers in sight. In his country, he wrote, \\"I would have known where to look for them. A young Jewish boy showed me the way: in a courtyard, on the second floor, was the shtible of Jewish drivers. It consisted of two rooms: one filled with Talmud volumes, the other a room for prayer. All the drivers were involved in fervent study and religious discussion.... It was then that I... became convinced that all the professions, the bakers, the shoemakers, etc., have their own shtible in the Jewish district; and every free moment which can be taken off from work is given to the study of Torah.

Gerda resisted, but an unspoken plea in her father's eye convinced her to strap them on. During a death march from January through April of 1945, those boots saved Gerda Weissmann's life. Many other women died of cold and starvation, but most fell for simple lack of footwear. Her camp sister, with whom she survived the worst horrors in several concentration and slave labor camps, died of exhaustion at a water pump minutes after American liberators freed the women from the march.<br /><br />Ms. Klein's tale about her boots, screened at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, led me to her book. I wanted to know every detail --- although, over the years, I have been privileged to hear many personal accounts from Holocaust survivors I know. Too many still cannot not speak about what they lived through. Millions never had the chance at all. By itself, the silence of the majority makes Ms. Klein's testimony priceless, like every other personal Holocaust chronicle. So does her reminder not to take anything for granted.

These historians look beyond the recent Western \\"frame\\" at Middle East history, exposing the falsity of Arab claims that the region was illicitly colonized: in fact Arab and Ottoman rulers were the true architects of the modern Middle East.<br /><br />Hardly isolated from Europe, the Ottoman empire often called great Western powers to its aide: Napoleon Bonaparte's 1789 conquest of Egypt prompted Sultan Selim III to declare Jihad against the French and join the infidel British and Russian empires to keep his own in tact. In 1804, the Russian and Austrian empires similarly guaranteed the Ottoman empire's integrity. A falling out with Russia produced an Ottoman treaty with the British in 1809. And so on.<br /><br />Arab and Ottoman pleas brought Britain to Egypt too. The British, French and Ottoman empires originally opposed the Suez Canal, which they feared would violate Ottoman integrity, harming overland trade routes to Asia. But successive Egyptian khedives pushed the idea, concessions for which the Sultan ratified in 1866. Khedive Ismail's bribes to Abdul Hamid II brought Egypt to near-bankruptcy; he sold his Suez shares to Britain in 1875. In the following upheaval, the Sultan begged Britain to take control of Egypt. Prime Minister Gladstone refused. Only renewed Ottoman pleas convinced the reluctant British to send a naval squadron to quell an Egyptian rebellion in 1882--ironically making Britain the Canal's chief beneficiary, an entanglement from which she tried mightily to withdraw. The Sultan snubbed Britain's offer to give Egypt back.<br /><br />Similarly, Ottoman escapades redrew Europe's map. In 1854, the Ottomans aligned with Britain and France against Russia in the Crimea--beginning a war that they theoretically could not win--only to harness the great powers and fight \\"as a full-fledged member\\" of the coalition. Russia left Serbia, Moldavia and southern Bessarabia (seized in 1812); the Black Sea was neutralized. Eventually, Romania emerged, triggering a Balkan eruption. In 1875, the Ottomans met new Balkan threats with harsh reprisals culminating in bloodbaths. Abdul Hamid II balked at proposed British and Russian solutions. The resulting war cost the Ottomans more territory. Ottoman Europe fell after the Balkan War in 1913.<br /><br />Yet Europe's great powers remained loathe to devour the Ottoman carcass, by then controlled by the Young Turks. Russia even offered to go to war to prevent another power from taking Constantinople. In 1914, despite secret Ottoman-German and Ottoman-Bulgarian alignments, the triple Entente again guaranteed Ottoman territorial integrity--in exchange for Ottoman neutrality, which Enver Pasha violated, weighing into World War I on the losing side. The Arabs willingly followed.<br /><br />In short, the Ottomans, with Arab support, brought ruin on themselves--by pursuing an imperialist World War I plan to again expand the empire, a catastrophe ironically exacerbated by their wins at Gallipolli and Mesopotamia, and territorial gains from Russia's 1917 withdrawal.<br /><br />Europe cannot be blamed, either, for the Ottoman genocide of 1.4 million Armenian men, women and children; the slaughter of 150,000 Christians in Assyria; or the order to deport from Palestine all non-Ottoman subjects among 100,000 Jews there, which took 10,000 Jewish civilian lives before the Germans and U.S. intervened.<br /><br />The Arabs emerged decided victors: Sharif Hussein of Mecca convinced the British (falsely) that he had full Arab backing for a Caliphate to replace the Ottoman empire--creating lasting friction among Arabs and between Arabs and the West. His rule would exclude Palestine (then running from the Mediterranean to all of current-day Jordan)--which Hussein, negotiator Muhammed Faruqi and the de Bunsen Committee all accepted in 1917, despite Hussein's later denials. Yet Hussein four sons would rule Arabia, Iraq, upper Mesopotamia and Syria. The Saudis took Arabia. Faisal lost Syria, but took Iraq. Abdullah got what Hussein had previously agreed was off limits --- 75% of Palestine.<br /><br />You get here the big picture: Ottoman and Arab empire-building, war-mongering, calumny, double-dealing and perfidy probably had more effect on the modern Middle East than anything else.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A.

The biggest problem comes in the title reference to Zeev Jabotinsky, and the book's theme. Shlaim takes these from the right-wing Zionist ideologue's 1923 essay, &#34;On the Iron Wall,&#34; published in Russian and translated to Hebrew in 1933. Problem is, it was a theory, not a plan. Jabotinsky posited that Palestine Zionists could not avoid clashing with Arabs, and proposed that they build an &#34;iron wall.&#34; By this, he meant a Jewish battalion in the British army, to halt Arab resistance.<br /><br />But mainstream labor Zionist leaders virtually ignored Jabotinsky. They knew the British would refuse--and considered him mad. Furthermore, Jabotinsky's right-wing legacy was anathema to labor Zionists for most of Israeli history. Far-right ideologies remain so, to this day. The Kach party, for example, is outlawed. Yet, Shlaim claims that the &#34;iron wall&#34; theory shaped Israeli politics from the 1920s to the 1980s. Balderdash.<br /><br />Shlaim derides Zionism, borrowing liberally from anti-Zionism that Shapira shows to have existed both in the 19th century and when the Jewish state was born. &#34;But historical revisionism,&#34; she writes, &#34; is surrounded by politics.&#34; Shlaim leaves out of his political account (which run from 1947's UN partition plan through the fall of the Netanyahu government) all the events that supply critical background and context to the Israeli-Arab dispute. One reads here only the most abbreviated accounts of the wars.<br /><br />One big missing piece is the regional effect of the cold war, attention to which has led other Middle East historians to opposite conclusions. Soviet interference in the region spawned worsening Arab-Israeli relations from the 1950s on as arms poured into Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and other Arab states. The only opportunity for Arab-Israeli peace opened after the Soviet Union collapsed, leaving Arab hard-liners without support for their traditional rejections. You wouldn't know it from Shlaim, who presents the conflict as if it occurred in a vacuum. For that, you need Conor O'Brien's The Siege, Martin Gilbert's Israel: A History or Howard Sachar.<br /><br />Shlaim also depends almost total entirely on secondary sources, most of them Israeli. Israeli state archives are open. His rare primary sources include few Arab documents, consulted only in English translation. Shlaim pretends that Arab state archives remain sealed--despite the availability of Jordanian files and many Arabic memoirs.<br /><br />What's the harm? Shlaim exposes all Israel's warts, but conveniently shrouds the Arab side in mystery. He winds every Israeli contingency plan and idea into his yarn as conclusive evidence of Zionist expansionism, ignoring all the evidence on Nasser's anti-Israel plotting, plans for a &#34;Greater Syria,&#34; and King Hussein's designs. He also virtually ignores the profound psychological and cultural differences between Israel and the Arab world.<br /><br />Worse, Shlaim often bases arguments on errors. For example, he claims that Levi Eshkol, who became Israeli prime minister in 1963, was far more liberal than David Ben Gurion, a &#34;fact&#34; he attributes to Eshkol's 1914 emigration to Palestine as a representative of the left-wing youth movement Ha-Shomer ha-Tzair (The Young Watchman). But Eshkol was never a member of Ha-Shomer ha-Tzair, a radical left-wing party--which in any case was founded later.<br /><br />Then, there's Shlaim's opposite treatment of Arabs and Jews. Their nations were cut from the same Ottoman cloth. But where Shlaim accepts Arab national interest, he refutes Israeli national interest. He sees Arabs as indigenous, their actions motivated by understandable interests. He sees Jews through a moralistic prism, as invaders. Thus, he criticizes Israel's 1948 agreement with King Abdullah, but not Abdullah's annexation of the West Bank, Egypt's seizure of the Gaza Strip or Syria's territory grab west of the international frontier.<br /><br />Israel of the 1950s was weak, isolated, and without sources of weapons to defend against the Soviet arsenal then pouring into the region. British prime minister Anthony Eden in 1955 demanded that Israel relinquish Negev territory for a land bridge between Egypt and Jordan. U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles urged Israel to trade territory and absorb 100,000 Arab refugees for peace. Those demands would have stripped Israel of territory allotted to her by the UN in 1947. Shlaim accepts them as legitimate, describing Israel as the bully.<br /><br />In poker, this is what you call a stacked deck.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

Some were famous--like Warsaw Ghetto resistance fighter Marysia Warman and Helen Foxman, the mother of Anti-Defamation League director Abraham Foxman, also a survivor. Most would have been anonymous but for these oral accounts.<br />From each brief history one gleans the minutia and split second decisions that made the difference between life and death and the keen will to live that bore up each woman.<br />Their accounts banish the overriding sense of doom normally associated with the Holocaust. Most of these women most lost everyone and everything they had, but not their human dignity. Very often, they managed to save others. Helen Foxman, for example, saved herself, her husband and her infant son. In Auschwitz, Miriam Rosenthal miraculously bore a son, who also survived. Even when their efforts amounted to little more than prayers and hope, each one resisted. Alyssa A. Lappen	2001-06-12

Add to that Henry Ford's hateful diatribes, also selling in quantity, and choice new poison by Michael Hoffman and Keith W. Whitelam.

They claim to have uncovered new evidence, but the charges directly parallel demonstrably false charges leveled in earlier books and &#34;reports.&#34; None of these charges are credible--at all.<br /><br />Anyone taken in by them should at least consult Michael B. Oren's magnificent article on the USS Liberty in the Spring 2000 issue of Azure--available online. He debunks them entirely.<br /><br />On the absolutely key point of motive, many conspiracy theorists charge that Israel attacked the Liberty on June 8th, 1967 to prevent the US from knowing the extent of Israeli victories in the war and to prevent the imposition of a cease-fire:<br /><br />Their theory falls apart, however, in the face of the facts: The very DAY of the Liberty attack, June 8, 1967, banner headlines in the New York Times literally screamed the news: Israelis Rout the Arabs, Approach Suez, Break Blockade, Occupy Old Jerusalem; Agree to U.N. Cease-fire; U.A.R. Rejects It (New York Times, June 8, 1967). Some secret.<br /><br />Does anyone really think those clever Israelis somehow prevented the President and his advisers from noticing these headlines? Please.<br /><br />Furthermore, Israel accepted the U.N. cease-fire while the U.A.R. (ie, Egypt and Syria) rejected it.<br /><br />Other passages hinting at extreme animus for Israel perhaps explain why this and other conspiracy theorists would publish such nonsense. Numerous apparently careless errors undermine their believability.<br /><br />Merely consulting old newspapers demolishes these patently false theories. Case closed.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

The details are searing by themselves--including the escape of two prisoners who fruitlessly warned the Allies what was occurring. These permanently imprint on the reader's memory. What lends Muller's account biblical proportions is his proximity to the evil heart of the death machine--throughout the war--his daily witness to mass murder, his memory of individual victims who fought to the last.

In the war that ensued, some 6,000 Israelis were killed, fully 1% of her population. That was roughly equal to the half the U.S. losses of the Civil War--still the most devastating both proportionately and absolutely--of all U.S. wars. It is only a third of the proportionate U.S. losses of World War II. Israel nearly lost--and won with no help whatsoever from the U.S.<br /><br />Subsequently, Israel fought four other defensive wars against Arab aggressors. Arab officials admitted last November and again in March that current low-level war, which makes six, was planned by Arafat during the Camp David talks. They began attacks on September 24 with bombs at Netzarim junction, one of which murdered Israeli David Biri--days before Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount.<br /><br />Israel, now 53 years old, has lived in a virtual stage of siege since her founding. Of 22 Arab nations, only two are officially at peace with her. The other 20 remain officially at war, by their choice. Mr. Finkelstein's work is an important--and honest--contribution to the understanding of this history. It is a positive contribution, being a much-needed antidote to the propaganda war that the Arabs have mounted, with increasing success, for the last 25 years.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

Fromkin recounts a great deal that he might have left out of a less complete survey. Its inclusion is but one thing that makes this work priceless.<br /><br />What emerges, before one is even halfway through, is a sweeping portrait of the many tragedies that seeded conflicts still plaguing the Middle East today.<br /><br />One major culprit can only be described as legendary British stumbling throughout World War I. At the core of Britain's Middle Eastern advisers was a group of bigoted, bumbling idiots, who could not see past the end of their noses. Sir Mark Sykes, for example, described many groups whose destiny he influenced with disgusting pejorative. Town Arabs, he described as \\"cowardly,\\" \\"insolent yet dispicable [sic]\\" and \\"vicious as far as their feeble bodies will admit.\\" Bedouin Arabs he called \\"rapacious, greedy...animals.\\"<br /><br />Sykes was also obsessed with fear of Jews, Fromkin writes, \\"whose web of dangerous international intrigue he discerned in many an obscure corner.\\" Not the least of these was the sadly mistaken view that the Young Turks party were governed by Jews, when in fact none were privy to their inner circle. This pathetic distortion of reality was informed by oriental affairs interpreter Gerald FitzMaurice, and shared by Gilbert Clayton, an adviser to Lord Kitchener. Like too many other British misconceptions about the Middle East, it was never investigated or much less corrected.<br /><br />Disasters resulting from the \\"Cairo group's\\" ill-informed advice abounded. Take the bungled attack on Gallipoli--caused horrific 500,000 combined casualties, which could have been sharply reduced, if not eliminated, had the allies acted swiftly.  Another was the reliance on the \\"diplomacy\\" of an Arab imposter, Lt. Muhammed Sharif al-Faruqi, who pretended to represent the Emir Hussein, Sharif of Mecca, but whom neither Hussein nor his son Feisel had ever met, much less entrusted with diplomatic powers.<br /><br />But there is plenty of blame to go around. Fromkin also plumbs the weakenesses of the Ottoman lords themselves, as well as those of duplicitous Arab leaders. Emir Hussein's actual emisaries neglected to inform the British that he did not know al-Faruqi--perhaps because he advanced an agenda which suited Hussein in many respects. But it caused problems. Worse, Arabs often negotiated in bad faith, knowing that they could deliver on few if any of the promises they made in pursuit of their goals.<br /><br />David Fromkin's intense scholarship is informed with the grace of a classic novel. Had there ever been any doubt, he proves that fact is stranger than fiction--and often a great deal more tragic.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A. Lappenis plenty of blame to go around.

These new historians all make one gross omission: They consider it irrelevant that seven Arab nations attacked Israel upon her founding in 1947, making no secret of their intention to destroy the new Jewish state. In 1947, Arab League Secretary General Azzam Pasha promised \\"a war of extermination,\\" \\"a momentous massacre\\" to be remembered \\"like the Mongolian massacres and the Crusades.\\"<br /><br />Nor do new historians bother to note that such words were followed by gruesome acts, about which the world has forgotten, given the ubiquity of biased news reports. In 1947 and 1948, for example, all but one of the 600 Jews captured by Arab forces, including many noncombatants and children, were murdered in cold blood--and mutilated beyond recognition. According to Dr. Eugene Narrett and Jerusalem Post reporter Sarah Honig, amid scenes of rape and other sexual abuse, the Jewish victims were dismembered, decapitated and photographed by their proud captors. In the Etzion settlements south of Jerusalem, three truckloads full of Jewish corpses were found sexually mutilated.<br /><br />Current accounts of those years often do, however, detail supposedly heinous deeds of Jewish fighters-without appropriate context. In the so-called massacre at Deir Yassin some 200 Arabs were killed. But new historians like Morris, Schlaim and Segev delete the relevant and defining fact that Deir Yassin was the scene of a pitched all-day battle, in which every male Arab villager was armed. One has to turn to more thorough and honest reporters, like O Jerusalem author Larry Collins, to learn that Arab fighters in Deir Yassin used women and children as shields.<br /><br />In war, bad things happen. But new historians fail to ask four critical questions: Who started the war? What were their intentions? Who was forced to mount a defense? What were Israel's casualties? Ask, and truth becomes crystal clear. As I note in a forthcoming Midstream article, \\"Mourning the Death of Peace,\\" Israel agreed in 1947 to accept a further partition of less than 20% of the land allotted by the League of Nations in 1922 as a National Home for the Jews. The Arabs, however, begrudged Israel even that small patch of land. In every war since, Arabs have mounted an effort to destroy Israel, either militarily or politically, just as they did in 1947. In 1967, Egyptian leader Gamel Nasser promised to wash Israel into the sea. This intention remains sadly evident today in the Fateh Constitution-and countless Arabic reports, statements and broadcasts, translated by the Middle East Media Research Institute. It seems that moderate Muslim leaders like Shaykh Professor Abdul Hadi Palazzi, who support both Israel and peace, remain a depressing minority.<br /><br />When the conflict is seen through the wide-angle lens of clear-sighted historians like Karsh and Shapira, who DO include all the relevant facts, the work of new historians goes up in smoke--as dishonest garbage.

I find ridiculous Finkelstein's attempt (in Chapter 5) to prove that Israel's participation in the 1967 [[ASIN:0345461924 Six Day War]] was not defensive, and not conducted to prevent a second Holocaust --- promised at the time by surrounding Arab and Muslim nations.<br /><br />Contrary to his contention, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser was preparing to strike Israel very hard, and made his intentions crystal clear in several belligerent actions leading up to the war:<br /><br />1) Nasser closed the Straits of Tiran, blocking oil deliveries and other trade through Israel's Red Sea port at Eilat, which he himself recognized at the time as an act of war.<br /><br />2) He ordered United Nations Secretary General U Thant to withdraw United Nations peace keeping forces from the Sinai Peninsula.<br /><br />3) As U.N. forces withdrew, Nasser massed 100,000 Egyptian troops and 1,000 tanks at Israel's southern border.<br /><br />4) Nasser signed a joint &#34;defense&#34; pact with Jordanian King Hussein which was actually tantamount to a declaration of war.<br /><br />5) On 27 May, Nasser, declared: &#34;Our basic objective will be the destruction of Israel. The Arab people want to fight.&#34;<br /><br />6) Egypt had a plan to attack Dimona, called off only hours before it was launched, because the U.S. discovered the plan and warned Egypt's U.S. ambassador of harsh consequences if it attacked.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the preparations and threats from Jordan and Syria also demonstrated their deadly animus. Both the Syrian and Jordanian armies were deploying men and ordnance across their respective borders with Israel, and were simultaneously issuing bloody promises to destroy Israel over their airwaves and in their print media.<br /><br />Finkelstein's claim to have disproved the work of Joan Peters in [[ASIN:0963624202 From Time Immemorial]] has also been completely discounted. Peters' book has over 1,800 citations from other respected historians and contemporary documents, including Arab, United Nations, League of Nations, British, French, Israeli sources.<br /><br />Moreover, Arab immigration INTO Israel was previously well established --- confirmed by (among others) Arieh Avneri's pre-Peters [[ASIN:0878559647 Claim of Dispossession: Jewish Land Settlement and the Arabs, 1878-1948]] and Saul S. Friedman's [[ASIN:0819124036 Land of Dust: Palestine at the Turn of the Century]].<br /><br />Arab immigration into Israel began in 1878, when Jewish settlers joined tens of thousands of Jews whose families lived in Palestine for two millennia after it was sacked by the Romans in 70 AD.<br /><br />In July 1986, Erich and Rael Jean Isaac (writing in Commentary) noted that Finkelstein failed to correct several serious errors when his about Peters was republished here. Actually, even Peters' Israeli critics don't contest her premise --- that Palestine's Arab population ballooned by virtue of Arab immigration.<br /><br />The critics merely contest Peters' varied sources, including an interview with Tewfik Bey El-Hurani, published in August 1934, which stated &#34;in the last few months, from 30,000 to 36,000 Hauranese [Syrians] had entered Palestine and settled there.&#34;<br /><br />Nevertheless, other proof exists. There was, for example, testimony to the Palestine Royal Commission by Moshe Shertok and Eliahu Epstein (whom Avneri quotes at length). Epstein visited 30 Haurani villages, and complained of an influx of Huranis. According to Avneri, in 35 regions of Western Palestine that became Israel, Arab population rose 135% between 1922 and 1947, compared to 98% in the 13 regions of Jewish settlement.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in three cities distant from Jewish development --- Nablus, Jenin and Hebron --- Arab population grew at only 56%, 78% and 64%, respectively over the same period. In 1949, Avraham Brawer similarly compared Western Palestine's population with far less dense populations of neighboring Arab countries.<br /><br />Furthermore, as noted in the [[ASIN:9652292974 The Rape of Palestine]], the 1937 Peel Commission Report states that the Arab population tripled between 1900 and 1937. So here, again, valid sources (contrary to Finkelstein) demonstrate Peter's accuracy. By contrast, for his sources, Finkelstein gravitates towards anti-Jewish and anti-Zionist propagandists.<br /><br />His chapter on Joan Peters proves nothing but the poor, and ideologically-driven, nature of Finkelstein's &#34;historical&#34; work.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

So here, again, valid sources (contrary to Finkelstein) demonstrate Peter's accuracy. By contrast, for his sources, Finkelstein gravitates towards anti-Jewish and anti-Zionist propagandists.<br /><br />His chapter on Joan Peters proves nothing but the poor, and ideologically-driven, nature of Finkelstein's &#34;historical&#34; work.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

But  in the 27 years since it was published, that past has grown ever more faded in public and journalistic memory.<br />Supporting Israel and the facts is now so politically incorrect that a prominent newspaper website recently deleted a posting stating this important background: In 1922 the League of Nations adopted by international vote a plan to establish a Jewish National Home in Palestine, which then included all of current day Israel and Transjordan. Shortly thereafter, Britain unilaterally and illegally granted more than 80% of that original Palestine to the Arabs, creating current day Jordan. And now, Israel is blamed for the plight of &quot;refugees&quot; that the Arab nations have exploited to the max in their 52-year war against the Jewish state.<br />Of many important pieces of the historical puzzle, the best is this: In 1919, less than two years after the Balfour Declaration, Emir Faisal of Syria and Iraq--then the only recognized Arab leader in the world--declared the plan &quot;moderate and proper.&quot; One result was the 1922 League of Nations vote to adopt the plan.<br />King Faisal's approval of plans for a National Home for the Jews was no less significant because it encompassed all of current day Israel and all of current day Jordan. In 1919, there were very few Arabs and many Jews in Palestine, and King Faisal saw the importance of recognizing the rights of the Jewish people to their homeland.<br />Unfortunately, most Arab nations--from which most &quot;Palestinians&quot; actually immigrated--never recognized even the considerably reduced version of the Jewish state and still prefer a permanent state of war rather than admit Jews the right to their state governing places in which tens of thousands of Jews resided even after the Romans sacked the second Temple in 70 A.D. And why should they? Thanks to a largely uninformed press corps, they are winning a propaganda war that has all but wiped out the past, substituting instead a Kafkaesque fantasy.<br />The publishers should RUSH this book back into print!

The facts, however, defy these descriptions.<br /><br />During the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s a series of Arab pogroms against Jewish towns and people resulted in the massacres of hundreds if not thousands of Jews. This followed a pattern of abuse and discrimination which dominated much of the Arab world for 1,000 years. Both sets of historical facts have been obfuscated today by reporters like Marton. The thousands of Jews who stayed in Palestine during two millenia after its Roman conquest were always subject to oppression--just like Jews who had fled to Arab lands.<br /><br />There, Jews remained a minority and were often (though not always) oppressed--subject to periodic massacres, rapes, dispersion and other horrors. This is well documented in many sources, including (but not limited to) Saul Friedman's superb [[ASIN:0819124036 Land of Dust]] (1982); Ariei Avneri's [[ASIN:B0087PBFFE The Claim Of Dispossession]] (1982); Samuel Katz' [[ASIN:0929093135 Battleground: Fact & Fantasy in Palestine]] (1st ed., 1973); and Kenneth Stein's [[ASIN:0807841781 Land Question in Palestine, 1917-1939]] (1987).<br /><br />All but one of these books predated Joan Peters' unfairly, much-maligned From Time Immemorial (1984) and while they cited many different and varied sources, reached the same valid conclusions as did she. A former journalist and peace negotiator, Joan Peters conducted an exhaustive seven-year inquiry in more than 1,800 Turkish, British, Arab, American, French and other sources, as well as first hand interviews.<br /><br />Another excellent volume that came after Peters', by the late scholar, diplomat, and Irish politician Conor Cruise O'Brien, [[ASIN:0671600443 The Siege]].<br /><br />Marton, on the other hand, revises history, accepting the false thesis that Palestinians were peace-loving victims of Jewish aggressors, while ignoring voluminous Arab hate and propaganda-- like that still emanating from Palestinian Authority-controlled media and mosques. One October, 2000, Gaza sermon for example exhorted Muslims to \\"kill the Jews\\"... \\"where ever you find them.\\"<br /><br />A December 1, 2000 Al Aksa sermon similarly proclaimed that Israel had offered only 10% of the West Bank to the Palestinians--of which Israel in fact offered 90%--and also exhorted Muslims to \\"liberate Palestine\\" from Jewish \\"infidels.\\" Was it really worth sending children to fight for the rest? Marton would undoubtedly not bother to ask this question.<br /><br />Arafat [never wanted] peace, according to Saudi-educated Shaykh Prof. Abdul Hadi Palazzi. \\"[After] Oslo the tone of the PNA media has never changed,\\" according to Palazzi, \\"the number of yearly victims of [Arab] terrorism is not decreased, Arafat [el-Husseini] has not refrained from declaring it is a temporary truce, and PNA officials have not even amended their charter [which still calls to Israel's destruction].\\"<br /><br />Marton would have us believe this is all the fault of evil Jews. If only they had been less aggressive, none of this would have happened. But defense is not aggression. And Israeli defense, though sometimes at fault, has never come close to that of her Arab enemies. Marton should eliminate her sermonizing and stick to the facts.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.

Twenty years ago, when I first saw him, I had been out of work for six months and was in constant excruciating pain. (Childbirth years later, was by comparison a piece of cake.) His examination was a revelation, and so were his treatments--an intensive therapy program that restored my health and for 20 years has prevented a recurrence.<br /><br />Back pain produced by the muscular-skeletal imbalances that Dr. Michele addresses here are threatening only to quality of life. But as sufferers know too well, what is the value of life if one can barely walk, sit or stand? It is surprising that very few doctors, even today, are familiar with Dr. Michele's revolutionary thinking. Fortunately, those in pain can still benefit from his wisdom --- by finding and buying this book. It works. Take if from one who has been there.<br /><br />--- Alyssa A. Lappen	2000-12-07

Except for the magnificent poems of Sharif Elmusa, much of the work refers to Israelis and Jews as locusts, occupiers, enemies, murderers and worse.<br /><br />The existence of Israel, established under the international law by the United Nations in 1948, is seen as &#34;the catastrophe&#34; and the writers almost unanimously hope, obliquely or otherwise, for its destruction. Those who have fought to that end are &#34;martyrs.&#34;<br /><br />To be fair, much of this work was written before the establishment of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in 1993. Yet the introduction to the paperback edition, published in 1994, makes no mention of that process. On the contrary, the editor lauds writers who have worked for &#34;the cause&#34; ---including those who refuse to live in states at peace with Israel. Arab writers even now take a hard line. An Israeli poet reports that despite peace with Jordan and Egypt, Arab writers in those countries theaten to ban anyone who contacts their Israeli counterparts. Thus, virtually no dialogue has developed, even among the writing communities.<br /><br />What can one say, after reading such work and learning such things? One hopes for a true and lasting peace, but if the literature is any evidence, it will be at best years before such a peace is forthcoming.<br /><br />---Alyssa A. Lappen	2000-08-10

It's especially irritating in the modern age, when the U.S. has achieved a level of respect for cultural differences, and all but eliminated blatantly racist comments and attitudes from daily conversation and life.<br /><br />The difficulty is that one minority in particular has not benefited from wide acceptance of all races. The Rom people --- Gypsies --- have in recent decades lost more people in Eastern Europe to hate-related murder than at any time since the Holocaust. Yet even in the U.S. they have not been heard. European hatred of Rom people is legion, and eradicating that hatred will unfortunately be a very long time coming.<br /><br />North Americans, though, should know better. Unfortunately, for the most part, we don't. The overall population knows nothing of Rom history, which included 500 years of enslavement, resultant poverty and misfortune.<br /><br />In this case, we have a &#34;classic&#34; that teaches old hatred to new generations --- by playing on the common stereotype of Gypsies as fortune-tellers, thieves and kidnappers.<br /><br />Please think twice before buying a book that will tell your kids the same old lies about a people that has suffered more than its share of extreme discrimination.<br /><br />---Alyssa A.
